0	18000	This week, Pokemon Go became canon by officially debuting a brand new Pokemon, though we still
18000	22120	have to wait for information beyond its looks. This is one new item amongst a sea of classics,
22120	25600	join us for a healthy mix of both in the week's news starting right now on the show, where
25600	33680	every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio. Hello my friends out there on the internet,
33680	37640	welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge
37640	44160	Radio, live tonight on September the 30th of 2018 with episode number 746 of our show.
44160	49600	I am Rob Roberts and joining me here in studio is Loki. How are you, Loki? Hello, I'm fine.
49600	55320	Yeah, fun week? Good week? No, I'm alright. Gaming? Do any DDR? We've had a lot of talk
55320	60360	about DDR's 20th anniversary this past week. We'll get into it, we have a news item later
60360	65160	about how Konami is acknowledging that, but have you done anything special to acknowledge 20 years
65160	69800	of DDR, Loki? I played a lot of DDR, that's about it. That's the way to do it. You know what's funny
69800	74080	is that out of the blue I got a message from a Facebook friend asking me questions about DDR
74080	79840	because they were like, you know, what was the good PlayStation mix because we want to set up
79840	84120	a dance pad and do all this thing and I'm like, dang, what a throwback because I'm thinking about
84120	88840	it's kind of sad you can't really play DDR anymore on PlayStation 3 or 4 like Konami just didn't
88840	92560	really push the series. Looking for your music game peripherals? You can find them used everywhere.
92560	97560	I know, I know. They were asking about like what type of pad should they get? They already were
97560	101520	kind of leaning towards the foam. You remember when Red Octane back in the day had those foamy
101520	105240	and I always thought those were probably the best ones. Step Maniacs. And the big zipper pouch.
105240	110280	The Step Maniacs pads. The ones that are like a thousand dollars. Oh, the metal? Oh, the actual
110280	115640	game. They actually sell the pads. No, I know. I know. I think they've been, those things have
115640	120240	been selling out as fast as they can make them. I see some of the stuff on Kyle Ward's Facebook,
120240	123360	like they just can't keep that stuff. I'm just glad I don't have to worry about that crap anymore
123360	128240	when I was like, oh, I'm going to build the better pads so they can actually play arcade DDR.
128240	133080	There you go. Uh, go into our chat over at live.vog network.com because we do date live
133080	137880	every Sunday night at the voice geeks network of vog network.com six o'clock Pacific nine
137880	141560	o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby black Wolf show. Orange right says, check your local
141560	147360	thrift stores. Oh yeah, we go to Goodwill every Saturday and um, they have all sorts of DJ hero
147360	151360	stuff and it's funny cause they don't really know how it's supposed to go together. So they have
151360	156880	like two turntables in the mixer in the middle. They're like, yeah, that's about right. Looks,
156880	164320	we don't know what this is, but it's $5 nailed it. All right. Uh, uh, dark Sakura, uh, not here
164320	168480	tonight. She is a on her work commitment for a little while longer, but she'll be joining us
168480	172880	a little later in the show for the classic game of the week. Um, so we'll talk a little more about
172880	178200	DDR and music stuff later, but let's get into the kickoff topic for tonight, which is a pretty big
178200	182880	update, something we've been waiting for. We wondered if the internet would really be able
182880	190920	to have some power over Sony and it looks like Sony has caved a little bit on, on what people
190960	198120	been asking about. Right. Logie. Yeah, they caved. Um, they're basically now allowing cross-play for
198120	204520	Fortnite. So, you know, following a comprehensive evaluation process, SIE has identified a path
204520	210080	towards support for cross-platform features for on select third party content. We recognize that
210080	215880	PlayStation four players have been eerily awaiting an update and we appreciate the community's
215880	220200	continued patience as we have navigated through the issue of the finest solution. Bullshit. You
220200	227920	just had a fucking backlash against your shit and that's why I like how you just just cut off the
227920	233360	official statement. Now, now this is lies. This is lies. The official statement is just like, we're
233360	237120	really, of course, you know, the vice president, they said, when you know, we're really happy for
237120	240680	the PlayStation Fortnite communities and this is a great step and we know that rocket league players
240680	245280	and their own communities wants to know what this means for them, but we don't have any updates at
245280	250680	the moment. In other words, the biggest game where the people are the loudest needed to get it the
250680	255640	first and in some ways, which was the most fucked up implementation because of the whole locked
255640	260720	account where like you couldn't even play it on the switch if you had a PlayStation four and all
260720	266480	that stuff. And they are releasing a process to unlink your account from the PlayStation four and
266480	271760	be able to play on all of them. Yay. So that's going to be happening soon. Well, that's great.
272280	276440	I wish I had time there that came to their senses. Yeah, I know. I wish I played more Fortnite to be
276440	281520	able to really appreciate this news, but, uh, I don't play a lot of it, but I know tons of people
281520	288560	do. So this is certainly a good start. But, um, let me ask about this. Like, is this, I mean,
288560	293120	cause this is still, it's almost kind of like a weird way of thinking now because this opens
293120	296880	Pandora's box. I'm not mistaken. They're not saying this is going to be limited to Fortnite.
296880	300920	They didn't come out and say only Fortnite is going to get an exception. They're basically
300960	304160	saying this is something we're going to be looking at in the future. So, you know,
304160	307440	like rocket league, like you mentioned, even though there might not be plans right this
307440	311160	second, I'm sure it's something they're, you know, going to be looking at in the next few months.
311160	317000	Um, what else? I'm Minecraft has gotta be something. Minecraft's weird cause it's a Microsoft game,
317000	321560	but I would think though that they should like plain. Well, yeah, and that's going to be a big
321560	326680	like news, but still Nintendo played nice with them. And come on, Nintendo is so backwards when
326680	331640	it comes to networking stuff that like if they're doing it, you probably should be doing it. Yeah,
331640	336200	I get it. You're, you're scared because you, you want to, you know, stop any sort of ways for
336200	341080	people to hack your platform. It doesn't matter what you do. They're going to find a way. And if
341080	345640	you do this kind of crap where you block stuff off and you like cripple different, you're just giving
345640	351720	them incentive to do exactly. Yeah. So it, you know, take it from Nintendo. I mean, they know
351720	355640	better. They, even though they have the cross platform stuff, I mean that hasn't stopped their
355640	362280	platform from getting hacked and you know, getting their characters turned into sex memes and shit
362280	366920	like that. What do you think will be the next game to, uh, and I asked this of our chat room as well.
366920	370840	What do you think will be the next game to cross over? You think rocket league is kind of obvious
370840	375640	one? It's a switch. It literally is just like a switch to flip on for them. Um, I would say
375640	381240	Overwatch, um, not PC so much because blizzard has made the decision. They don't want keyboard
381240	385080	and mouse mixed with controller, which is going to be weird though, because yeah, I know it's coming
385080	389320	up later. We'll talk about that. We'll get into that then. Um, but, um, as far as like PlayStation
389320	393240	four and Xbox one, there shouldn't really be anything, um, separate news consoles anymore.
393240	397880	And another reason why I target Overwatch is, well, I mean, it's a big deal. Overwatch is
397880	403880	everywhere and Blizzcon is coming up. This would be a great thing. I mean, surely if I were blizzard,
403880	407800	I would be pushing to make this an announcement. We're going to make it. Blizzcon is that
407800	414280	Overwatch will soon be playable on PlayStation four and Xbox one cross platform, especially,
414280	418360	especially if they're working on a switch version after all, which I kind of, I actually don't think
418360	422200	they are, but I mean, I would love to be wrong on that. I would love, love, love to be wrong on that
422200	427400	and have a switch version of Overwatch. Um, and that would be fantastic if it was completely
427400	431400	playable across all those platforms. Although there is a part of me that thinks PC should be
431400	436840	involved in that as well. And blizzard might need to think about, um, just having keyboard and mouse
436840	442120	designation versus, you know, uh, controller designation, but I'm sure I think they'd be
442120	445160	worried people would try to hack that. Do you remember back in this, funny enough, we were talking
445160	451800	about DDR, right? Do you remember in DDR ultra mix, when you would play online, you could see
451800	457800	if the person was using a dance pad or a controller. But the thing was, is that it had to be an
457800	462600	officially licensed dance pad for it to show up as dance pad, or it would show up as a controller
462600	466840	because I think the USB was probably sending some sort of special signal to the Xbox. I have an ID.
466840	471400	Yeah. I don't know how it all worked, but I just remember that. So it's like, they could probably
471400	475880	do that with like a keyboard mouse signature versus a, uh, I already have peripherals that
475880	479480	could do keyboard and mouse if they really want to. That's true. That's true. So I don't know,
479480	484200	maybe blizzard needs to, I think about that a little bit, uh, going to chat at live.vognetwork.com.
484200	489800	Uh, Brad from Pod Culture agrees, bring Overwatch to Switch. Uh, Dortitsuya says, I agree with Loki
489800	495560	though, either Rocket League or Minecraft. Um, let's see, Kaijuto in chat says, I bet the crossplay
495560	500680	gets underused too if there's some type of option for crossplay. You know, let's talk about that
500760	506120	comment for a minute actually. Is, is after all the bitching and moaning and whining,
506120	511240	which I really think the catalyst for this was the locking of the Fortnite accounts.
511960	517160	I don't think you would have seen the big backlash that you did if people had been able to log in and
517160	521160	make their Switch account, no problem. I think if Sony wants to pinpoint, where did we fuck up?
521800	526200	That did you in? Uh, cause I honestly think if that hadn't been a factor and you could still
526200	530040	make an account wherever, people would have just accepted the fact that, eh, whatever,
530120	536040	you can only play on whatever platform. Because of this, you know, the previous thing where they
536040	539880	locked shit out and because of the statements like, well, we're just the best platform. So
539880	544040	that's why we just don't want to play nice. Their follow-up statements weren't exactly graceful.
544600	549560	And also their support for mods on the platform versus what the support is on the Microsoft
549560	553160	platform. I'm just like, if it comes across platform stuff, if I'm going to purchase a
553160	555880	game on one of those two platforms, I'm not going to purchase it on Sony's platform.
556680	561720	Granted, I don't have a Microsoft console by PC, so I just will play it on PC. But might it
561720	567080	influence your decision when we're talking PlayStation five and Xbox max? Absolutely.
567080	573000	It will. Yeah. So this will be very interesting where when we start announcing those consoles,
573000	577320	which could be as soon as next year, probably more, I don't know, actually,
577320	581560	do you think Microsoft's going to plunk down Xbox next? That's what I'm going to call it for now.
581560	585560	Cause obviously we don't know what the name will be. Do you think, um, Microsoft's going to plunk
585560	589720	down Xbox next next year? Cause they've already, they've already done the little, little, little
589720	595560	tittle teas. Probably I'd say maybe a couple more years. I think 2020, I would have guessed 2020 for
595560	599800	both, but I don't know. Then Microsoft kind of did a little, maybe they want to be first out the gate
599800	606040	like they were with three 60. Who knows? Yeah. I don't know. Uh, Brad, the stuff that they have
606040	611880	right now, they could change. It's just policy that they don't agree with. Well, going back to
611880	616600	guys, you just comment about cross play getting underused. I mean, it's kind of a good call out.
616600	621320	How many people are really going to be using this cross play thing? Maybe it's different in a game
621320	626040	like Fortnite where they're trying to load up a hundred players or whatever. But I mean, I don't
626040	630920	know, like I haven't really sat there and thought about like, who do I want to invite on Xbox when
630920	636360	I'm playing on my PlayStation? I mean, if this rule is really changing, it almost kind of makes
636360	644920	me have to think about the way that I approach this online gaming. Because to be fair, even if
644920	650680	cross play is going to be a deal, there are still some things that are locked away. For example,
650680	658200	party chat, right? Now, if the party chat is in the Fortnite game, then I imagine that'll work
658200	662760	cross platform. I haven't really heard about voice chat, but I'm thinking more of the fact that like,
663080	669000	on PlayStation, you can have like a localized party on PlayStation, right? And then I believe
669000	672120	it's the same type of deal on Microsoft's platform, right? So if I'm kind of working
672120	675560	with my own little party here, I wouldn't necessarily be able to talk to the people
675560	681880	on the Microsoft side. So there are some things that are still kind of locked if I'm not mistaken,
681880	690120	right? So you still would have the best experience if you're all on one ecosystem, am I right?
691080	691880	I suppose.
694760	698600	See, we haven't even we haven't even bothered to think about this, which is just hooray.
700920	704920	I think that's all done in because that's why they have voice chat with, you know,
708120	712920	Fortnite right now in the Switch version is because it's in the actual app and not the,
713960	717160	you know, it's not linked to the console or anything.
717160	721000	Okay, let me go to chat at live.vognetware.com. Bobby Blackwell says, it's more about playing
721000	725800	with friends that may have other consoles. For instance, I wouldn't know where to buy Overwatch.
725800	729720	I have people to play Overwatch on PC. I have people to play on PS4. I have people to play on
729720	734280	Xbox One. If I could buy one Overwatch and play it with all my friends, that would make me more
734280	739480	likely to play Overwatch. I'm lucky enough to have all the consoles and I have all the consoles as
739480	744760	well. But I mean, the kind of the point I'm trying to make there is that it may not quite be that
744760	753640	easy. If the chat is on Battle.net's side, which I think it is, it would for PC, it has to be.
753640	759560	So the chat is on Battle.net side for PC. But what if you want to chat with the people on
759560	763320	PlayStation and you get in one of those, are you going to be able to voice chat with them
763320	767080	if the voice chat isn't supported through Battle.net on consoles? Does that make sense
767080	772040	what I'm saying? Yes. Then you're not, you're playing with them, but you're not really able
772040	776040	to interact with them and you might still kind of be back at the square one problem.
776040	780440	So this is going to put an onus, if I'm not mistaken, on the third parties to have their
780440	785640	own server structures so that people can use voice chat. Or you just need to get Discord apps on all
785640	790680	consoles then. Oh, you think that could be a thing? Discord on consoles? Do you think Sony or
790680	795080	Microsoft is interested on Discord? Actually, didn't Microsoft have a partnership with Discord of some
795080	801320	sort? I don't think Discord's on Xbox, but I remember Microsoft wanted to cuddle up with them.
801320	806920	That's true. That's true. Let's see. Yeah, Microsoft has a partnership with Discord.
806920	811080	I thought that was a thing, but they have a partnership, but that doesn't mean a Discord
811080	818360	app on Xbox One yet. Maybe that's something where it's going. Anyway. Oh yeah, they show the game
818360	822920	you're playing on Discord. That was what it was. If you connect your Xbox Live and you're playing
822920	827640	something on Xbox, it will show on Discord. Kind of like Spotify will show what you're listening
827640	833800	to. That whole type of thing. Yeah. Yeah. So interesting. Let's see. Dr. Tzuyu says,
833800	838040	maybe that's why Nintendo didn't do any of that stuff for online. If they're open to cross-play,
838040	841960	that would have, they would have had to worry about all that stuff. So I guess they decided
841960	846440	to just make it simple. Yeah. I don't know. I think we're still going to find some things out
846440	852120	as time goes on, but I do firmly believe that we would never have been at this point
852120	856200	if Fortnite accounts hadn't been locked, if you'd used it on PlayStation 4. I think that
856200	863560	was the thing that made this whole thing fall apart. Yeah. I don't think, I don't think the,
863560	867320	the call would have been this loud. I don't think everybody would have been as crazy, but that,
867320	872120	that was the thing that, that did him in, especially when Sony knows that for the longest
872120	877640	time, Nintendo has been competing to be the other console in everybody's house. Right. We've known
877640	880840	that for some time. Nintendo has always been competing to be the other console in somebody's
880840	886680	house. It's never really competed on that same level in some regards as PlayStation 4 and Xbox
886680	890920	One. Although there are plenty of households where the Switch is the only co or Wii U,
890920	897800	Wii whatever, is the only console to be found. So, interesting. VidPower in chat says,
897800	903080	it'd be interesting if Microsoft chooses Discord over Skype, which they own. It would be
903080	910200	interesting because Microsoft does own Skype, but you don't really think about Skype for gaming very
910200	916520	often. Skype is how you call your family with, in another country with free long distance,
916520	921480	I think is, or, or free internet, you know, VoIP or whatever. Uh, I think that's what a lot of
921480	926280	people are associating Skype with. I don't know. A lot of the online games I've played that are like
926280	930120	the, the reality stuff I've talked about before on the show, like Survivor and Big Brother,
930120	934440	they all play on Skype because Skype is you, everybody fucking has Skype because it's on
934440	940360	every Windows computer. I guess, I guess, but Skype, I mean, everybody has it. Like,
940360	945160	it's very easy to get on a mobile app. It's on the fricking PC. It's preloaded with Windows.
945160	949640	I know, right? So it's like everybody, even if you have a Mac, like it's very easy to get Skype.
949640	956840	It's just an app on, you know, the, the OS store. So Skype, I feel like a lot of people use Skype,
956840	961240	but that's just my perception. And that's, that's not even talking about here at OLR,
961240	964200	which by the way, on that note, before we get into our gaming weeks,
965160	970840	did you know that Skype will finally stop working on this potato XP computer as of November 1st?
971640	978040	Well, I know, right? So they said that they're not gonna support the old Skype 7 or whatever,
978040	982360	and it's gonna force you to go to the newest Skype, which of course doesn't work on XP,
982360	988200	which I know you all give me shit about the fact that I'm still running XP for this show, but A,
988840	992600	money doesn't fucking grow on trees. So I haven't exactly bought, you know, the upgrade computer,
992600	996920	but to be fair, it is in the path because obviously we're going to be talking about
996920	1001160	Twitch streaming. I can't Twitch stream on this current computer. So it was always part of that
1001160	1005560	path was to, yes, finally get off of this potato computer that we've been using for so long, um,
1005560	1009720	to do the video streaming and all that. But it's just, it's just irritating to have that arbitrary
1009720	1013800	deadline put in because they don't want to support the old Skype anymore. You know,
1013880	1018120	DDR ace runs XP embedded, so it's fine. That's right. You know what? Your arcade
1018120	1025880	games still use windows XP, so get off my ass. I guess we could always use the tablet
1025880	1029560	kind of like we used to use before. Um, I have thought about just straight up,
1029560	1034440	maybe switching to discord at this point. Um, I don't know. I'd be curious about your guys's
1034440	1039640	feedback, but you'd have to tweet us or use, use our, use our discord to tell me what you think.
1039640	1043160	If maybe now is the time with this whole Skype thing changing,
1043160	1046600	maybe it's just time. We just go to discord for calls. So tell me what you think.
1047240	1053720	Anyway. Um, rage nator and chat suggests clearly you have the wrong fucking trees. Oh,
1053720	1056680	well if you have some money seeds, please let me know. I would love to grow some of
1056680	1061720	those in my backyard amongst everything else that's growing out there. Um, thank you,
1061720	1064680	thank you, Brad from pod culture. I can get you a free copy of seven or eight if you want.
1064680	1069320	I appreciate that. I actually have a serial number for 10. Thanks to a kind listener.
1069320	1074040	I just, you know, have to have the machine that makes it work, which I have some parts.
1074040	1080520	It's just, everything's a mess. So actually, I honestly, I kind of wanted to go to a laptop
1080520	1083800	so that the show could be portable as well. So that's still something that's in the back
1083800	1087160	of my mind, but I have to make all those decisions the next month or two.
1087720	1091880	But, uh, yeah, like I said, money doesn't grow on trees. I'm not going to ask the listeners
1091880	1097000	for money. I don't want to do that. Um, I will, uh, you know, I have money set aside. It's just,
1097000	1101000	you know, working that all out. Anyway, enough about that behind the scenes stuff.
1101000	1105160	Let's get into the types of games that we have been playing this week in how was your
1105160	1108840	gaming week. So Loki, what types of video games you've been playing this week?
1108840	1113640	Mainly Pokemon go, um, because I've been doing a lot of walking, so I've been playing that.
1114520	1120280	Um, aside from that, actually, I forgot to mention the last week I played, um,
1120280	1125480	old school musical, which is fantastic. It's a rhythm music game. That's got a
1125560	1129000	lot of homages to old NES and super NES games.
1131080	1135640	And then I also played lots of dances, revolution, extreme. That's pretty much it.
1136360	1142520	I watched, um, I watched, uh, Bobby Black Wolf play some of that old school musical on his
1142520	1146680	Twitch stream. It looked really fun. It looked kind of like guitar man, but like retro style.
1146680	1150920	Yeah. Kind of cool. And then they have like this, I've already beaten the game and then they have
1150920	1156040	this, um, like chicken crusader mode thing. The, you play a lot of the same songs again,
1156040	1158680	but they add modifiers to them to make them harder to play.
1159800	1163800	So I'm going through that right now. Okay. That's cool. Um, yeah, there's, there's,
1163800	1167560	is that, is that the DLC or is the DLC like a whole separate thing? Cause Bobby's talking
1167560	1171160	about, he hasn't played the DLC yet. Um, I don't remember that it's DLC or not.
1172200	1176280	I did buy the DLC. I think the DLC adds more songs to that mode.
1177240	1182200	Okay. I'll, uh, I'll have to, I will, it's on my list of things to check out, but you know,
1182200	1185960	you know me, I'm always stuck with the online games. So let's talk about my gaming week and
1185960	1189480	all the online games I've been playing. Cause I'm still trucking along in world of Warcraft.
1189480	1193880	I hit max level, which is now believe it or not max level in world of Warcraft is 120.
1193880	1200440	That's the highest level you can get to when wow first came out, 60 was the cap. So it grew 70,
1200520	1206040	80, 85, 90, a hundred, 110, 120. That's where all the, that's how many expansions this game's had.
1206040	1209400	That's a lot of expansion. I know. Right. But wow is kind of an old game at this point,
1209400	1213320	if you think about it. But, um, yeah, I'm, I'm still enjoying the expansion. This is
1213320	1216520	about the point where I'd usually burn out cause I'm not really interested in rating,
1216520	1221160	but we'll see how it goes. Who knows? Um, so there's that. Uh, and then, um,
1221160	1225080	I've still been playing Final Fantasy 14. I'm juggling two MMOs. It's crazy.
1225080	1230280	But, uh, you know, I'll, I'll get a text message like, Hey, let's do an expert if I have SE 14.
1230280	1233960	So I'll switch over, do the expert. And it's kind of like, I'm keeping my feet wet in that game.
1233960	1239320	But right now, wow. Kind of feels like what's more new and exciting. Even though 14 had a patch,
1240280	1247640	like, and I love 14, but I really hope their next expansion isn't as formulaic as these past couple
1247640	1252520	expansions have been. And what I mean by that is that here comes the point one patch, which will
1252600	1258040	have two new dungeons and an eight man raid. Here comes the point two patch, which will have two new
1258040	1263800	dungeons or one new dungeon and a 24 man raid. Here comes that back to the eight man raid,
1263800	1268840	back to the 24 man raid and a dungeon or two dungeon. It's like, it's very, very predictable.
1268840	1273800	And there's not enough, like, I just want to like fuck around and do something different stuff,
1273800	1278600	which wow, because it's been around so fucking long and he has all these expansions.
1278600	1284120	Wow. Definitely feels like there's like so much like other like crap you can do in that game.
1284120	1287800	Like if you want to get into like the pet battles and all that, that whole Pandora's box,
1287800	1293000	that's a whole thing you can do. Uh, the time walking I noticed was a great catch up mechanic.
1293000	1296120	I didn't want to do the cataclysm dungeons cause that's what's going on. But I was like,
1296120	1301640	oh, I'll go do one. And I got so many points from doing the, the time walking as a healer.
1301640	1306600	I was able to get like all this sweet gear to like bump my gear scores. It was really cool. So,
1307400	1312520	um, Raginator says, wow, came out when? 2004? Yeah, that sounds about right. And Brad from
1312520	1318520	Pod Culture at live.vognetware.com says time for wow remastered. Well, funny you say that because
1318520	1323800	World of Warcraft classic is going to start, they're doing this weird thing. So
1324920	1332520	it's not launching in November, but if you buy the virtual BlizzCon ticket that they want to sell you,
1333080	1338840	you will have access to the demo for World of Warcraft classic, which kind of blows my mind
1338840	1345000	because I'm like, how, what? It's, it's classic, just regular world and it's classic World of
1345000	1349160	Warcraft. Why is there no, so basically they're selling you early access to World of Warcraft
1349160	1352520	classic. That's what it is. That's just not where they're calling it. They're calling it a beta.
1352520	1356600	Don't they have like a free demo right now for World of Warcraft, the regular World of Warcraft?
1356600	1360760	If you want to, like you can play, it's either level 20 or level 40 you can, but again,
1360760	1365720	there's 120 fucking levels. You can play for like free. So there's a lot you can do.
1365720	1371720	There's your fucking demo. Why buy one? No, it's so, it's so weird. We're going to sell them and
1371720	1375800	get this guys. We're going to sell them a demo for a game that's right now. That's free to play.
1375800	1380040	Let's start off with, but we're going to even include less features in it and they're going
1380040	1384200	to pay for it. That's what people want. They're only doing World of Warcraft classic because
1384200	1389400	the fan base was like, I missed a day of molten core and back in my day you had to be level 40
1389400	1394360	to get a mountain. You had to work for it. So finally, after all this rabble rabble and the,
1394360	1398840	the servers, the fakie servers that Activision Blizzard finally had shut down, they were like,
1398840	1405400	fine, you want classic World of Warcraft. We will spend resources to, to bring back classic
1405400	1410440	Warcraft. But if you think about it, like, it's not as easy as making the old client available
1410440	1415400	because like, like computers are vastly different. So they have to be re optimized.
1415400	1419080	I would imagine they've got to go back and tune it now for widescreen
1419080	1422040	because World of Warcraft back then didn't even support fucking widescreen.
1422040	1426440	Fuck that. Don't make it widescreen. Make it four by three. This is what they fucking want.
1426440	1430840	Let them have it. Just put some borders around it. I honestly think World of Warcraft classic
1430840	1435480	will be that thing. You go back and play once and be like, wow, this wasn't as good as I remember
1435480	1438840	because that's what always happens. It's never as good like the PlayStation classic.
1439800	1445160	I think, wow, he's like old, but here's the thing. And I say this respectfully with many
1445160	1450600	friends who love Blizzard products and as a Blizzard fan myself, Blizzard fandom is a cult
1450600	1456680	and people will pay that money to do that. And, and Blizzard is the masters at this.
1456680	1461080	And this is a company that's owned by Activision and Activision will charge you for whatever you
1461080	1466120	want to buy. But here's the thing. Activision lets Blizzard do whatever they want because
1466120	1470760	Blizzard is good at it. You will notice Blizzard has managed to really, for the most part, stay
1470760	1476120	very independently Blizzard. There's very few things where Activision has kind of like
1476120	1480680	come in and said, no, no, no. And that would be probably putting Destiny and Call of Duty
1480680	1486280	on the battle net launcher. But what, but honestly, Activision's smart in doing that because they
1486280	1492040	know Blizzard is a cult and the easiest way to bring awareness to Destiny is to put it on the
1492040	1498040	battle net launcher. Imagine if people could buy the battle net launcher with wow gold, or I'm
1498040	1503320	sorry, if people could buy Destiny 2 with wow gold, which you can, I mean, it takes a lot of gold to
1503320	1510120	do it, but technically you can do it. It's crazy. But anyway. And again, I say that as a fan of
1510120	1515080	Blizzard, because you know what else I played this week? Diablo 3, cause season 15 is going on.
1515080	1519880	And now I'm sitting here going, I do kind of want to get this on the Switch, I think. And I'm,
1520200	1524360	I'm like, I'm having that whole like angel and devil on the shoulders, except I actually think
1524360	1528760	it's two devils yelling and screaming at each other because like I have one devil going,
1528760	1535560	you fucking moron, you already own Diablo on PC and PlayStation 4. And I think Xbox 360 as well.
1535560	1539080	Like I already owned Diablo 3 three times. Like, do I really need the Switch version?
1539080	1541160	And then the other devil's going, of course you need it.
1543560	1548760	Because it's new and shiny and everybody else is going to be playing it and it'll make for
1548760	1555640	good live streams. It's the devil and the devil on my shoulder. Some of you have devils and angels
1555640	1562680	on your shoulders. No, I have two devils. Anyway, what else did I do in my game a week? Oh, one more
1562680	1566440	game that I definitely have to mention. One other game that I played this week, cause I did a live
1566440	1571400	stream of this. I played Time Spinner, which is the brand new game that's been in development
1571400	1576440	for a while. In fact, we had the developer of Time Spinner on OLR. It was a few years ago,
1576600	1581880	it wasn't long after the Kickstarter. So it was a few years ago and Time Spinner came out and I
1581880	1586040	played it on stream and it's fun. I mean, if you like Castlevania Symphony of the Night,
1586040	1593800	bam. Time Spinner is a great homage to that. It's not like a carbon copy because the weapons are a
1593800	1598840	little different. Obviously the bosses, the story is completely different. So it's not like you're
1598840	1603720	just playing the same game. And also, they do some different stuff. Like you have a time stop
1603720	1607880	mechanic, which as you kind of watch the way I'm thinking in the live stream, playing this game
1607880	1612360	for the first time, I kind of realized like, oh, this time stop mechanic has many uses. Like,
1612360	1619400	it's not like your typical, like get the double jump, which allows you to get up to this level
1619400	1623080	that you couldn't get to before. And now you progress. Like that's, that's the way
1623080	1628600	Metroidvanias have always worked, right? Now you have the underwater suit. You can go swimming and
1628600	1633720	access the next level. Like, but the time stopping mechanic kind of has a variety of uses.
1633720	1640520	Like you can use it to stop an enemy in midair. So you can effectively do a very amateurish double
1640520	1644280	jump. Basically you jump on the monster, then jump on the ledge. You can do that. Or I found that
1644280	1649720	using the time stop mechanic through trial and error, you know, watch me play that boss fight
1650280	1653960	that I was stuck on for like 15 minutes, because you see me kind of thinking through,
1653960	1658200	okay, I'm gonna do this boss the normal way. And then I realized, oh, using the time stop mechanic
1658600	1663320	makes this boss a ton easier. And you can use this to kind of, you know, do something about
1663320	1667480	the charges and some of the other things. Now, of course, your time stop mechanic is limited
1667480	1671000	in how much you can use it. So you have to kind of be thinking about all that. But I like it,
1671000	1676680	it added another layer to a formula that many of you are already familiar with. So I really
1677480	1682680	like that. And Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, Rob buried the lead. His internet works now. Yes,
1682680	1686680	I wanted to get to that. I was, you might've said I was able to live stream time spinner.
1686680	1693400	So my internet is fixed at home. So here's the thing. So you remember Comcast tech number two
1693960	1699480	came out last week. And although he was nice and he listened to my problem and he didn't try to
1699480	1705240	sell me a BS answer, long story short, he wasn't able to fix the problem. So they were going to
1705240	1709560	send a third lead out here. And I originally had him scheduled for Wednesday, but I forgot, oops,
1709560	1713080	Alan had a doctor appointment Wednesday morning, so he couldn't be here in case the appointment
1713080	1716840	ran long. So I was like, whatever, I've dealt with it this long. Let's just do two more days.
1716840	1720120	So I rescheduled the third tech they were going to send out for Friday.
1720120	1723400	I'm trying not to bore you with this story too much, but it's fucking fascinating.
1723400	1729640	So Wednesday at around 11 o'clock, Alan messages me. He's like, I'm back from my doctor's
1729640	1733240	appointment. It seems like the internet's down right now. Something, something must be going on.
1733240	1738200	I'm like, all right, whatever. And he said noon, it came back up and he's like, wouldn't it be
1738200	1745800	funny if... And then he goes silent for about 30 seconds and he comes back and he says, hahaha,
1745800	1749960	I'm going to run out into the street and play in traffic. And he sends me a screenshot of the
1749960	1754760	upload to Google working full speed. I'm like, so the internet, like, did the tech just come out
1754760	1760040	here anyway and fix something? I don't know. But you know what I did notice, Loki, later in the
1760040	1765240	weekend, they've been doing all this construction on a house around the corner. I don't know if you
1765240	1770040	ever drive... I don't want to give away my home too much, but there's like a park there.
1770040	1773480	And sometimes you drive around the park on purpose to get the pokey stops, right?
1773480	1774120	I do.
1774120	1777400	Okay. Yeah, I do too. Even though it's not the most direct route, I drive it to get the pokey
1777400	1782440	stops. So there's a house over there as you go around. There's been an Xfinity van parked out
1782440	1787720	there like three times this past week. And I'm like, oh my God, like whatever they're doing on
1787720	1792040	that house, that was my problem. It probably wasn't. Maybe they were having the same problem.
1792040	1799480	And then they found, oh, hey, it's like a splitter or something in one of these junction boxes
1799480	1805080	that's fucked up. And so they went and fixed that. And lo and behold, it works for the whole
1805720	1806360	neighborhood.
1806360	1810520	Yeah. Bobby Bockel says, I bet the issue was at the main relay station that services your street.
1810520	1814440	The last time I was having a bunch of issues, the problem was at the junction box. And I bet,
1814440	1817640	you're right, either these people had the same problem or they had some other type of problem
1817640	1821720	that caused them to go open the box. And that took down the internet for an hour on
1821720	1826280	Wednesday. And then when it came up, magically worked again. So the most frustrating part of it,
1826280	1831480	I mean, Comcast has been actually messaging me on social media. And they're really good
1831480	1836040	about responding to you on social media if you have problems. Because I didn't even tag them,
1836040	1839480	but they were like, hi, how can we help? Because they saw me bitching. So they were like, hi,
1839480	1842680	how can we help? And so I sent private messages and they've been really good about responding
1842680	1846680	and all that. But the problem is, because I kind of did it that way, to be fair, they don't know
1846680	1851400	what the fuck happened. So it's like, I will never know why the internet went down. Y'all have some
1851400	1856680	great theories and you might be right. You're probably right. But I don't a hundred percent
1856680	1860360	know any of you are right. We will never a hundred percent know the reason why.
1862360	1866680	I had issues where like our internet would drop for hours or whatever, and there'd always be like,
1866680	1872680	you know, text in the area working on something. Eventually it fixes itself. It's dumb shit.
1872680	1877400	Now I need to see what kind of credit I get for my upload not working. I think they already gave
1877400	1885320	me like a $20 credit. I'll get nothing and I'll like it. Here's the other funny thing. Actually,
1885320	1891080	the tech, this is not to derail into cable talk, but all you internet nerds have these
1891080	1894840	same problems. Admit it. So the second tech was out here and he was looking at the problem.
1895720	1900360	And then he looked at our TV thing. He's like that. And he points at the box that we were using
1900360	1904840	is like, that is so old. We don't even support these anymore. Like, why do you still have this?
1904840	1909400	And I was like, cause that's how often we watch TV and I don't know why we're paying for it.
1909400	1913240	I do know why we pay for it. So I can watch RuPaul's drag race on my computer,
1913240	1917000	basically through the Xfinity.com and all cause you can watch cable on your computer.
1917000	1920920	You know what I do, which is what it's like. I pay for basic cable and I don't have the box
1920920	1925720	hooked up. It's in a box. Cause you can use your computer. Cause, cause guess what they wanted to
1925720	1932760	pay. They want me to pay for HD content. Where is I can just go online and watch that same HD
1932760	1938280	content for no additional money. So you know what I got out of this whole thing. I got a new TV box.
1938280	1942440	That's like a third of the size. Alan will watch TV once in a great while. Once in a great while,
1942440	1946440	he's like, I'm going to go pet the kitty on the couch and watch CNN or something. And that's,
1947320	1953080	but like I barely use, I'm I know I'm overpaying for cable, but well,
1953080	1956440	are you in the United States? Yes. Then you're overpaying for cable.
1956440	1965080	True. True. All right. Anyway, uh, let's see, going to chat at live.punknetwork.com.
1965080	1968920	Uh, Dungeon Buster says I got the same reply when I returned a box that stopped working.
1968920	1973720	Wow. I don't think we carry those anymore here. Have a new one. Um, Ray Sheeter says the credit
1973720	1977800	will come in the form of Comcast giving you two middle fingers and a flaming bag of poop.
1977800	1982040	You know, here's the thing though, for all Comcast issues, like I think Comcast knows they have a bad
1982040	1986440	customer service rat because I will say with the exception of the first tech who is out here,
1986440	1989800	who I wasn't here when he was here. So I'm getting all the secondhand through Alan,
1989800	1994360	but everybody that I interacted with was like super nice and went out of their way to be like,
1994360	1997720	Oh, it doesn't still work. I'm so sorry to hear that. Let's see what we can do. It's not,
1997720	2002440	it's not that we, nobody wanted to say, well, can't fix it. Nobody's mad at like
2002440	2007560	the customer service or anything. They're mad at the CEOs. It used to be that it used to be
2007560	2011400	that way where everybody was like, God, those people over there are assholes. Uh,
2011400	2014600	yeah. Some of their customer service in the past has been terrible because like,
2014600	2018120	yeah, I remember talking to them and they're like, yeah, you could just pay less and you get,
2018120	2022760	you know, faster speeds and you plus you get TV and stuff and then sure enough, you know,
2022760	2026840	Oh, Hey, wait a second. Why is this bill more expensive than what I was paying for before?
2026840	2031720	Oh, because that guy was a fucking liar is what it was. Oh, okay.
2032440	2037640	Uh, anyway. All right. So anyways, sorry. Long enough deviation on my internet problems,
2037640	2041720	but I bet, you know what, somebody out there, you're going to have the same problem eventually.
2041720	2045240	Like this is just, everything's going to the internet. I think less and less people
2045240	2049080	even using their TV. I think it's funny that I use my computer to do what the TV would do,
2049080	2053240	but that's where my 4k monitor is. So I want to watch stuff in 4k go on my computer.
2054040	2059480	Anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about, uh, uh, other announcements, which I really don't
2059480	2063720	have anything as far as like upcoming shows off or anything. You know, I almost, I will tell you
2063720	2068440	this. You guys might think this is funny. I was originally, when I came back from dragon con,
2068440	2073320	I was originally going to take tonight off so I could go to Folsom street fair, which I haven't
2073320	2079000	been to in like 15 years. Cause that was this weekend. Um, and I'm not talking about a street
2079000	2084600	fair in the city of Folsom. I'm talking about the other one. Uh, because I, my friends always
2084600	2087880	talk about it as a good time and I haven't been in so long. I was like, Oh, sure. I'll go.
2087880	2092760	But because we had that show after dragon con that we had to call off, I was like,
2092760	2097320	I don't want to take another show off. So that's why I'm here. So anyway, uh, we don't have any
2097320	2101240	shows off planned for a little bit, but next week on the show, I don't even know if you know this
2101240	2105640	Loki, I'm very excited about this next week on the show, we're gonna have a guest in studio.
2105640	2112120	My friend Delvin is going to be here from Toronto and he is the host of a show called video game
2112120	2117640	realness, which you can check out on iTunes. Yes. And, uh, well, because I also co-host
2117640	2121160	reading is fundamental. The drag race podcast. I haven't talked a lot about on this show
2121160	2126680	because it's not my show. I'm the host on psychic show, but it's there. And I also,
2126680	2130200	I don't know how many of you that listen to this would enjoy that, but if you like drag race,
2130200	2135480	go check it out. Reading is fundamental. Um, so he's going to be here in studio, so that's going
2135480	2140280	to be a good time. So, uh, very excited to have him and welcoming him to the show next week. I
2140360	2146680	can't believe that's only a week away. Oh, all right. Uh, let's get into other gaming news.
2146680	2150920	There's a lot going on, lots of conventions, not just the street fair on Folsom street,
2150920	2156360	but other conventions going on, right? Yes. That's right. Mine caught or my mine coughed mine craft.
2157400	2161160	I thought you said my cock and I'm like, no, that's my cost. That's what happened. That's
2161160	2166200	what's happening at Folsom right now. No, uh, Minecraft earth was this weekend. So they did
2166200	2170840	a big live stream. I didn't watch it. I just caught the highlights because they waste way
2170840	2175240	too much time with a bunch of streamers that I don't even know about or care about. This is more
2175240	2179880	of like a thing that my kids might be interested in, but I don't know. So they did make some
2179880	2188680	announcements. Um, so starting off, there was some new stuff coming in a, I am not sure what
2188680	2192760	the next update's called. Um, cause I know the last one was aquatic, but they're going to be
2192760	2198920	having some new stuff that has to do with the villagers. Um, lots of focus on that. So for
2198920	2207000	example, with the villages, now they're going to be getting new biome, um, like new biome related
2207560	2211640	architecture. So like stuff that's in the desert is going to kind of like desert architecture stuff
2211640	2215480	that's in the jungle is going to look a little bit more jungle-y, you know, that type of stuff.
2215480	2219080	The jungle is going to be more jungle-y. Is that what you said? No, the buildings. Cause right now
2219080	2223240	the buildings are all the same. So like they're going to have, you can just see the patch notes,
2223240	2227800	jungles are more jungle. Like in the desert, for example, they have like, like a street market
2227800	2231560	set up and they have like little kiosks and stuff like that. And the villagers are dressed
2231560	2236040	differently. Can't wait to go and wait. That's great that we're talking about the future of
2236040	2242040	Minecraft, but where is the fucking 4k pack that they announced like over a year ago at E3,
2242040	2247960	where's the super dude? And yes, I am going to bitch about Minecraft in 4k. Leave me alone.
2247960	2253240	It looks great with the, the, uh, if you want your Minecraft in 4k, you're just going to have
2253240	2261000	to play the Java version is what you're going to have to do. So, but you know what? And then along
2261000	2267000	with that, they're also, they have, um, new, Oh, so yeah, the next Minecraft update is going to
2267000	2271720	be called the village and pillage update. So, cause they have pillagers now, which are villagers
2271720	2275480	that attack villages and they have like these beasts that are with them as well. So you can
2275720	2281400	those off. Um, pandas are going to be in the game. Cool. They have a crossbow, which is pretty
2281400	2285160	awesome. Wait, the pandas have a crossbow. No, you have a crossbow. I think the pandas should
2285160	2291880	have a crossbow. What do y'all they pandas with crossbows? Yes or yes. Um, then of course, you
2291880	2298200	know, they're going to have, um, the new scripting API is going to be coming soon. Uh, they're saying
2298200	2303320	that they're going to be, is that so you can program the pandas to hunt people. Yes. So you
2303400	2307480	can do that. And they also have animations that you can give you more customization options.
2308040	2313640	Um, you can add particles and stuff to your different creatures and stuff. They released
2313640	2320440	a new piece of content called inspiration Island, which is as big like Minecraft theme park type
2320440	2325720	thing that you can go download for free inspiration Island sounds like a church retreat. Sorry.
2325720	2329480	Well, there are people flying kind of religiously. So maybe it is, I don't know.
2329720	2334920	They're fairly safe. They're feeling, but this, this though is right up your alley, Rob
2336280	2341720	Minecraft dungeons, a dungeon crawler game. Yes. I heard about this. It sounds awesome. Tell me more.
2341720	2348040	Yes. So, uh, Minecraft dungeons is Diablo Minecraft basically. Yeah. Set the same set
2348040	2352840	in the same universe. Uh, they didn't really show too much as far as gameplay goes. Oh,
2352840	2358280	I mean, it looks, it looks like it's going to be, you know, like a hack and slash
2358280	2363960	Diablo type game. So child's first Diablo type of thing. Sign me. What do you mean child's
2363960	2367880	first Diablo? Sign me the fuck up. This sounds great kids. If I want to get my kids into Diablo,
2368520	2373640	you know? Oh, I see. So it's, it's Diablo without the Satan imagery and with, with, uh,
2373640	2378360	Minecraft, cute, cutesy stuff instead. Yes. And pandas with crossbows. Of course.
2381240	2385560	Awesome. You know, with mods, you can do anything. I know you can make those pandas have crossbows.
2385560	2390840	I know. Or, or as a rage hater in chat says, pandas with crossbows that shoot tiny pandas
2391960	2401560	have even tinier crossbows. Absolutely. Oh man. Yes. I need to set up that. We,
2401560	2405080	we talked about doing a Minecraft server and then dragon con kind of threw everything off.
2405080	2409720	We were gone to the realms. Yeah. Yeah. We'd still need to look at setting that up. So it'd be fun.
2409720	2413400	But now that's, that's the thing I want on our realm is pandas with crossbows. Can you do that?
2413960	2417720	Not yet. Cause the updates not out yet. I see. When do we have a date for the update?
2417720	2422120	No. Okay. Well look forward to the, uh, VOG presents Panda with crossbow.
2422120	2426520	They have like still like they haven't, I don't think they've released the mob that was
2426520	2431320	unveiled in the last mine con earth. So there's still a little behind with things,
2431320	2435720	but now cause cause you do in chat says they already have a Minecraft dungeon crawler. It's
2435720	2441640	called fight the dragon. It's on steam. So, I mean, clearly other developers have probably
2441720	2445560	taken the cutesy graphics of Minecraft idea and merged it with the dungeon crawler.
2445560	2450360	I'm sure there is a rogue like with Minecraft graphics and I'm sure there is a battle royale
2450360	2456520	game with mine. So indie developers have come up with it because you know, that type of art style
2456520	2461960	is perfect for people like me that can't draw or, well, okay. It's funny. I used to be able to draw
2461960	2466840	then I stopped drawing for a very long time. And funny enough, you lose your talent when you stop
2466840	2473000	and don't practice something for a long, long, long time. Um, so unfortunately my art skills
2473000	2478520	on the PC are not as good as they used to be. And so that's what I'm stuck with is Minecraft type
2478520	2486200	art. Uh, going to chat, uh, Bobby Blackwell says, do you think we'll have pandas or 4k first pandas?
2486200	2493960	How about 4k pandas? I'm going to tweet them right now. 4,000 pandas. When I'm tweeting them right
2493960	2503560	now, could y'all retweet and fave when 4k pandas, and then the people listening on the, uh, podcast
2503560	2510120	feed will be like, oh, that's why they tweeted that all of a sudden. I wonder what, um, was,
2510120	2514040	I don't even remember what it was called. It wasn't the 4k update. It was like the,
2515240	2522120	um, better graphics or I don't remember was not better to get. I, what did they call it? Like,
2522120	2526200	it was like supposedly like something like it had to make a name. Maybe it was the 4k update.
2526200	2530680	No, it was like the super duper deluxe graphics pack or something. They used a lot of like silly
2532200	2535720	names in the, in the title of that super duper 4k graphics pack. That's it.
2537160	2544120	I was close. So let's see. Here we go. Here's an article that was a couple months ago.
2544120	2549120	Let's see what it says about, about the 4k updates. Um,
2551240	2558360	thank you for your patience. Love Microsoft. That's it. Yeah. It doesn't really say it says,
2558360	2565560	um, it's possibly pushed back to 2019. We don't know. So it's all speculation. They don't know
2565560	2570600	vid power and chat says 4k blocky graphics is the future. You're damn right. But it was
2570840	2575560	like about the blocks. It's about the water, the sunset, like if you want, it does look good.
2575560	2580440	Go look at it. Like I tried to get like, and it's funny cause I have a graphics card that's
2580440	2585960	truly capable of doing this crap. Yet for some reason, you know, it doesn't want to play nice
2585960	2591240	with the newest version of Minecraft on the Java version. So I can't get, I have,
2591240	2597800	I can't get the 4k like type stuff working like the, um, uh, Sonic ether.
2597960	2604520	Was it Sonic ether or, um, it's one of those that has like the fun texture waters and the
2604520	2612840	moving trees and stuff like that. But yeah, I don't know. It, it does look nice. I w I would
2612840	2618280	like that update to come out, but I'm not holding my breath. All right. Well, I'll let you know if
2618280	2623400	Minecraft replies to our tweet. All right. Cause you know, I'm sure that nobody else tweets them.
2623400	2628440	Any demands ever. Let's talk about Pokemon. Go Loki's favorite game right now. He's wearing
2628440	2633320	his gotcha on his wrist. I noticed. Is it running right now to get, um, it's not on right now.
2635000	2639560	Do you have, um, issues where the settings change on you like randomly?
2639560	2644360	Uh, if I have it in my pocket and I accidentally am hitting that little button without realizing
2644360	2651160	it. Yes. I don't ever have it in my pocket. No, I don't know what's up with that. You know,
2651240	2656680	there's an app you can, I have the app and that's what I use, but like I'll notice like I set it to
2656680	2661320	basically I have it, you know, set the auto catch everything. Sure. But I turn the settings off on
2661320	2666440	the notifications on in my app depending on what amount of regular pokey balls I have. No, I don't
2666440	2671240	know what's up with that. And so like, I'll like have it auto spin the pokey stops and I'll notice
2671240	2675480	it won't spin it and it's giving me the indicator. Oh yeah. Tap the button twice to spin the boogies.
2675480	2680440	I'm like, I fucking told you the auto spin this shit. What the fuck? And then I go into the app.
2680440	2685720	It's like, Oh yeah, we turn that off. And then like, you know, it'll be auto catch unknowns and
2686280	2690200	it's like, Oh, sorry. You know, that's turned off too. It's like, what the fuck? So now every
2690200	2693640	time I started, I have to check to make sure the same. They're correct. Interesting. No,
2693640	2697880	I don't know what's causing that. So speaking of unknowns, do you have one yet? No, I need to trade
2697880	2702840	you one from dragon con. I need them out of my inventory. Take one. Okay. All right. We're like
2702840	2707240	three star friends, right? The start, it's only like 1600 stars. It's like four star friends.
2707240	2710920	Yeah. We're getting closer. I actually, so for Pokemon go, I didn't talk about it during my
2710920	2715800	game a week, but I hit a best friends with three people this week. One of them is act deft, um,
2715800	2720440	who, uh, is there in the chat. So we actually hit four stars. And the nice thing is I was able to
2720440	2725480	time the lucky egg every time. So I hit it with my friend, Kyle in Canada. I hit it with act theft.
2725480	2729880	And then my friend, John here locally, who I used to live with when we were doing OLR,
2729880	2733800	uh, when we were on Justin TV, he was my roommate during that period. So we all hit four star
2733800	2740200	friends and I had my lucky egg going each time and I got 600 K XP from that crazy eyes on, um,
2740920	2748760	Friday I walked six miles. Wow. Yeah. I'll never do that again. That was too, that was too far.
2749560	2754920	Cause you know, were you trying to get a mime and a Kangaskhan that bad? Um, I did get a, I did get
2754920	2761960	a, um, no, I didn't get him. I think I have a, my, I got a, um, far-fetched not far-fetched
2761960	2770280	Toros. Um, the one that's dressed up like a woman. I don't remember the tangela. No, no,
2770280	2775560	I've got one of those. Mr. Mime is a little, not mr mime. It's uh, the other jinx. I got a jinx.
2775560	2779240	Finally. I didn't have a jinx. Oh, okay. That's not one of the rare ones though. But, um,
2780040	2786200	no, I have a tangela. I have a few of those, but yeah, it's, um, but I was just surprised
2786200	2790840	like, cause I, I, I forget that kilometers aren't as far as miles. And so like, yeah,
2790840	2794280	that's like 10 kilometers right there. Well, as far as the walking event goes, uh,
2794280	2797640	one thing that is worth saying about Pokemon go, something I want to talk about was that
2797640	2801480	they just put out a tweet today. It says they have extended that until October 8th.
2801480	2806600	So if you have not hatched your mr mime and your, uh, Kangaskhan that was supposed to end today,
2806600	2810440	but they extended it through October 8th, probably because they're selling incubators and all that
2810440	2815640	crap like crazy. I've been trying, I've been putting in seven K eggs all the time. Whenever
2815640	2821000	I get, it's a low, the thing is it's a low, low dropper. It's like a 2% drop rate for a Kanga or
2821000	2825720	a mime. No, I think Kanga is at 5% and mime is at two for some weird reason. There there's a chart
2825720	2830440	on silph road, which is a great Reddit for Pokemon go. If you're not, uh, it's the silph road on
2830440	2835480	Reddit. It's a great resource. Yeah. I walked, I walked, you know, cause you kind of know the
2835480	2840360	area where my work is. So I walked all the way. I walked over the freeway cause they have that
2840440	2845560	walking trail. It's over the freeway. I walked all the way from there all the way down the Kilgore.
2845560	2849480	I went to the KP market on the way there and I went all the way down the Kilgore and it came
2849480	2855000	all the way back. That is very far. That is six miles. Wow. Okay. Well, you know what? Like,
2855000	2859560	I got to say that I'll give Pokemon go this like, you know, despite how ridiculous this egg event
2859560	2863160	has been, even though I'm over it now, cause I have three Kangas and three mimes. So I've
2864920	2868520	that I have also been doing a shit ton of walking because of it. You know what I do?
2868520	2872920	I don't even use, use the gotcha because you know what credits walking better than anything,
2872920	2878520	the watch. And it's the only thing that fucking watch app does decently. So I'll start my watch.
2878520	2883080	I have an Apple watch and I'll start my, my walking and I'll do it. And it tracks very,
2883080	2886360	and I can look anytime, see how much further I have to go. And it pushes me to walk more.
2886360	2893240	So I got to say, if nothing else, you know what this game is like gamifying, walking and exercise
2893240	2898840	in a way that everybody walks on the Nintendo DS. What was that? Never did. It was for me.
2898840	2903800	It's my Fitbit. My Fitbits really motivated me to walk every day in like three months. Cause I
2903800	2908360	walked, I do the three miles walking during lunch cause I can't do anymore. Cause that it's a really
2908360	2913960	long time. I just, I got away with it on Friday because most of my team was gone. And so it's
2913960	2917080	like, no one knows when I leave for lunch and no one knows when I come back, no one's paying
2917080	2925400	attention. So I was able to walk for two hours, but, uh, you know, it's just three miles a day
2925400	2930280	though. And then I do DDR at home. I mean, it's killer. Like my feet are just absolutely killing
2930280	2936440	me at the end of the day. But, but then I have so many calories, eat things I want to eat and then,
2937080	2940680	but I don't even eat all that stuff. And I didn't have tons of calories. I lost three pounds this
2940680	2944520	last week, I think, or this week. Good for you working on it. Just don't overdo it. Like I said,
2944520	2947800	I told you, I complimented you last week. It's noticeable. Uh, anyway,
2947800	2950840	Brad from pop culture says there needs to be trading with long distance friends.
2950840	2955640	I will say what is kind of cool though, is that the eggs still come from the place that they were
2955640	2961160	sent from. So like one of my Kangas cons is a Mexican Kangas con thanks to act deaf because
2961160	2965720	he had sent that egg, which opened up and ended up being a Kangas con. Uh, one of my Mr. Mimes
2965720	2970840	actually the third Mr. Mime I opened is from Atlanta. So I know three people in Atlanta.
2970840	2975720	So that egg either came from Bobby Black Wolf, his wife, or Charles from the Pokemon go podcast.
2975720	2979800	I don't think, you know, which I need two more friends. I added Alan. I still need two more
2979800	2983720	friends for that stupid quest. Put your code in chat. They'll help you out. I will.
2984760	2988760	By the way, Curtis told me he got like a flutter request. Thank you guys very much. I appreciate
2988760	2994520	that. Oh yeah. I need to add him. I forgot. There you go. Scroll up and chat. I saw Curtis last
2994520	3000360	night cause um, his, his boyfriend was having a um, a birthday party and uh, I said, so how
3000360	3004360	many people did you get from your phrase? Like, Oh my God, I have so many. So I was like, yay.
3004360	3010440	So there you go. Anyway, that made me laugh. Uh, somebody just joined chat to say, I will add you.
3011400	3016040	So get that code in the chat. Your problems will be over. You'll get, you'll get play. I have a lot
3016040	3021000	of people that, you know, listen to us already. So I was just, you know, Well, it's nice. It's
3021000	3024280	nice to know there's actually people out there and I will send you gifts. I have tons of gifts.
3024840	3028520	Like I will not. I'm horrible at sending gifts and I was gonna say, I didn't get to finish my
3028520	3033560	thought, but I said, Charles from the Pokemon go podcast adore him, but he's really bad with gifts
3033560	3037160	and I understand why he's the host of the Pokemon go podcast. I'm sure he has 200 friends. He has
3037160	3042360	max friends list. So I don't think the, in fact, I'm pretty sure the egg that the Mr. Mime was in
3042360	3048360	did not come from him. It had to have been Bobby or Jennifer. So it was one of one of the two of
3048360	3054120	them. Um, and actually I think it was Jennifer because Bobby's gifts usually come from not
3054120	3057480	Atlanta. They come from a different city, which I don't know if he wants me to say on there,
3057480	3064120	but he tends to send them from another city. So, um, yeah, there you go. Anyway. Um,
3065160	3070200	that was where I, so I like that, that the eggs are labeled with where, what friend basically
3070200	3073320	said, I'll just read it out on air. So if anybody's listening and it's not in chat,
3073320	3079000	we can do that. So my friend code seven, two, four, six, seven, six, four, four,
3079000	3083080	one, five, six, three. And I've already, Oh, and they're in chat as well.
3085960	3090200	I'll add people now. Okay. So all right. You're brave. I won't, no, no offense, but I won't give
3090200	3094680	my code out on air. Like you can ask for it, but I'm just like, when you ask for it, I'm going to
3094680	3098680	give you my disclaimer that I'm really shitty with gift giving. Cause I just don't like today.
3099400	3103720	I have been like, like lazy all that. I haven't left the fucking house yet,
3103720	3107320	which I kind of need to do cause I need to go spin a pokey stop to get my street going. But like,
3107320	3111960	I haven't gotten a single gift today to send out. So Sundays are just my lazy day.
3111960	3117720	Yeah. And Brad, I've already got you. So, all right. All right. Anyhow. Uh,
3117720	3122280	what I really wanted to talk about before we turned into a Pokemon go podcast. No, it's fine.
3122280	3127080	There's a lot. Pokemon go is still popular. Uh, but one thing that we were talking about last
3127080	3132840	week because these little nuttos, as people were calling him, the little nut things with
3132840	3138760	the nut for a head that would, and I'm talking about an ACE hardware store, not the dirty thing.
3138760	3143800	So yes, they did not have testicles for heads. It had a little ACE hardware nut for a head. And
3143800	3147720	then like maybe like a diddly body and you would catch it. The real question though is
3148280	3156040	has someone put the Royal crown on this thing yet? Shut up. Anyway. So, uh, the deal is that
3156120	3161320	Pokemon was officially unveiled this week with the real name. It's not called nutto. It's called
3161320	3166920	meltan is the actual name of that. Uh, and it is going to be a mythical Pokemon. So it's kind of
3166920	3171080	interesting that those are out in the wild because I would think you were going to catch that, uh,
3171080	3174920	through like a quest line or something in Pokemon go, but we'll see. They're still out there too.
3174920	3180120	The meltans are still out there. I've noticed because the other day, because I had my thing
3180120	3183320	catching Pokemon as I'm walking and stuff. And I looked at the other day, I'm like,
3183320	3188280	why do I have 12 dittos? That's too many dittos. I don't need this many.
3188280	3191560	Yeah. It's those dumb things. Well, if you're still stuck on that new quest,
3191560	3195160	like you've just come back, like it's act, this is like the best thing that's going to happen.
3195160	3198440	Yeah. Cause you find those. Yeah. Before they started this event with all the, you know,
3199000	3203160	uh, ghastlies out there is like, Oh, catch ghost Pokemon. And it's like, now it's like,
3203160	3209080	ah, that's no problem. Yeah. So anyway, um, so meltan is officially unveiled and it will be,
3209080	3215560	uh, in a new po- it was unveiled in a Pokemon let's go trailer. So that is the new Pokemon
3215560	3219720	that is going to be added to the Kanto Pokemon. Because again, if you weren't already aware,
3219720	3224200	Pokemon let's go Pikachu and let's go Eevee is only going to future. At least for now. I don't
3224200	3228440	know if they plan to expand it in the future, but only the gen one Pokemon, but they always tease,
3228440	3234200	there would be one more Pokemon that is a brand new Pokemon also in it. And it is meltan. So
3234200	3239000	it's kind of lame though. Well, it's, it is kind of neat though. Like kind of like Jason
3239000	3245240	said in tonight's intro that basically Pokemon go is now that established part of the cannon
3245240	3252520	where they have unveiled something that will affect the game boy games in the Pokemon go,
3252520	3257880	uh, or, uh, not Pokemon go Pokemon. Let's go. You can actually increase the stats of your Pokemon
3257880	3262600	that you have there too. So you can actually build those up to like a hundred percent or whatever,
3262600	3270200	which is nice. Be, and also you will be able to send Pokemon from your Pokemon go into the
3270200	3276040	switch. Let's go, but it will not go the other way. So if you weren't, if you're not already
3276040	3281080	aware, it is a one way street. You send your poacher. I'm positive because that's, they don't
3281080	3286760	want you to level all your stuff up and let's go and then send it back to Pokemon go. You'd be at,
3286760	3289960	you'd throw off the balance of the game because I thought that was the whole point. I thought that
3289960	3294280	you could store it like in the Poke ball or whatever and then you like walk and stuff and
3294280	3298680	it levels it up and you can send it back. It's kind of a glow. Yeah, but you can't put it in
3298680	3303640	Pokemon go is what I'm saying. And the Pokemon, basically that Poke ball is a glorified Pokemon
3303640	3307160	go plus. I mean it, it will do a couple extra things. It sounds like too, but it's basically
3307160	3312120	a glorified Pokemon go plus. All right, cool. Got my three friends. Yeah. Nice. Here you go.
3312120	3315960	I just have the evolve a grass type and evolve and evolved grass type of one. Yeah. That would
3315960	3321800	have been great last week. That just means like a Venusaur. I know. I know he means you have to
3321800	3325960	find one of them. Oh yeah. Why didn't you do a new chicory today? You should. Well, right. I
3325960	3331000	didn't have been chicory today. Well, that's fine. I have tons of bubble sores and stuff.
3331000	3336440	All right. And I was gonna say, just get the candy and evolve the second form or whatever
3336440	3340760	takes a hundred candy. Anyway. Yeah. All right. Um, moving on. That's plenty of Pokemon go talk.
3340760	3343720	Let's move on. Loki. You've hinted at this a bunch, which you're about to talk about.
3343720	3348520	We've already kind of brushed this topic because Microsoft officially said officially
3348520	3354920	said something on this. So they were working with razor, um, to help add support for keyboard and
3354920	3361400	mouse to games on the Xbox one. And so now they're enabling keyboard mouse support on Xbox one for
3361400	3366840	select Xbox insiders for the next few weeks. And then, um, right now it's going to be a game by
3366840	3371160	game thing. Developers bill to choose whether they want to implement it or not. That's pretty
3371160	3376120	cool that they're going to do that. And he said most wired and wireless keyboards and mice will
3376120	3381960	work on the Xbox one, which yeah, I would think so. It's just a keyword, a mouse. I mean, I can't
3381960	3386680	imagine a keyboard mouse that wouldn't work. Um, and then of course they're going to also have
3386680	3390840	maybe some razor gear that's going to have the Xbox logo on or something like that. But
3391960	3397080	it's interesting in somewhat like this. It makes me think unless, you know, of course they disable
3397080	3403320	it. But, um, you know, like Fortnite or not Fortnite, but, um, I guess the Fortnite would still
3403320	3407800	work too, but I would think that you would want to differentiate this person's on a keyboard mouse,
3407800	3412040	this person's in, you know, on controller. Kind of like I was mentioning about the,
3412040	3418280	what DDR used to do. Yeah. So, so I don't know. Um, that's going to be very interesting if, uh,
3418280	3422760	they start kind of allowing, I mean, it's weird because like PlayStation four already allows
3422760	3428280	keyboard and mouse, but so few games on certain games. Yeah. It's basic. The only one I can think
3428280	3432760	of is Final Fantasy 14. I don't know anything else that uses keyboard and mouse. And what's funny is
3432760	3438200	that back on the Xbox 360, I used to play Final Fantasy 11 with a keyboard on 360. So it's weird
3438200	3441960	to me that Xbox one, like we haven't been talking about keyboard and mouse, but we're talking about
3441960	3445880	more than just MMOs. We're talking about like using a keyboard and mouse to play first person
3445880	3450280	shooters, which I don't think any of these things have ever done. See, this is this right here is
3450280	3456200	a perfect point. It's like, this doesn't seem like that big a deal, but you think about it. I mean,
3456920	3462840	this is basically, it's like Microsoft is listening to their users. Like, yeah,
3462840	3467000	this is why we have backwards compatibility. This is why we have cross play. This is why we have mod
3467000	3470920	support. This is why we have keyboard and mouse now it's because they're listening to what people
3470920	3477080	want and they're giving them what they want, which I got to tell you, it goes a long way, you know,
3478040	3482920	towards when it comes to that next console, you're going to be thinking about, okay,
3482920	3487240	do I want the console that, you know, got its head up its ass because they think they're the
3487240	3491640	greatest thing on, you know, the earth. And, but yet they don't support these things. Where am I
3491640	3496600	going to pick this other console that has more support towards user-generated stuff and more
3496600	3501800	things that fans have been asking for? Because right now it used to be a performance issue
3501800	3505880	between the 360 and like the PlayStation 3, whereas the games would perform better on the
3505880	3512600	360, which is weird. Why did I get a PlayStation 4? But I don't know. And then exclusive games,
3512600	3517000	I guess, you know, but is that really all you play is exclusive games? No,
3517000	3523640	you play mostly cross platform games and, you know, which system is it going to play better on?
3523640	3531000	I don't know. All right. Well, yeah, I mean, with that whole thing, because I'm looking at chat,
3531000	3534680	Orange Right says I could see people complaining about people having an advantage with keyboard
3534680	3538680	and mouse though over controller. Well, haven't we now opened that box thanks to cross play?
3538680	3542920	I mean, the cross play you fought so hard for on PlayStation 4, now you're going to be playing
3542920	3548440	against PC people who are using keyboard and mouse, right? So this is something we kind of
3548440	3555480	have to figure out now, I think. So we'll see. Anyway, let's move on and talk about Nintendo
3555480	3559400	online cloud saves. Now we've talked about this a little bit already in the past about this whole
3559400	3564520	system, but it was clarified this week that the cloud saves are going to be, and of course now my
3564520	3569320	site isn't loading, but I believe the cloud saves are going to be there for six months. So if you
3569320	3573320	were a panic that Nintendo was going to delete your save, as soon as you let your Nintendo online
3573320	3577880	account expire, Nintendo did clarify that it's still going to be there for six months. I still
3577880	3583400	think many people would like to know that they could do a physical backup of some sort of those.
3583400	3587480	And I think that's what people would really like to be able to do is just like use a USB stick,
3587480	3592040	you know, kind of like the other consoles that you do. But at this time, at least it's not going
3592040	3595960	to be that your cloud saves are just going to disappear the first day anyway. So at least we
3595960	3601720	know that much, right? Yes, this is, I think, reasonable. This is basically putting them in
3601720	3607720	alignment with other services. So I'm completely fine with this now. Yeah. I mean, this is really
3607720	3611720	how they should have done it from the get go. And I'm glad it didn't take them very long to
3612280	3618280	realize that this is probably something they should do. Yeah. Anyhow, also, a little talk
3618280	3623640	about Virtual Console has slipped out there. And again, my site isn't loading, but I'm going off
3623640	3629720	of what I remember of this story is that they had said that there was in the files for the eShop,
3629720	3634040	I think, had recently been updated. And in those files for the eShop were references to Virtual
3634040	3638680	Console. So people were going crazy going, oh, my gosh, it's going to be Virtual Console. But
3639320	3642520	there's thought that they might have just copied over some type of master database file from the
3642520	3647400	3DS. So this might not quite be what you think it is. Yeah. So basically, a switch to Datamire
3647400	3653240	notice that switch eShop JSON file had just been updated and now contains references to
3653240	3659880	the terms Virtual Console, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance and DS.
3659880	3663240	And now there's two way. They basically said there's two ways to look at this. Perhaps
3663240	3669400	it's just a carryover from the 3DS or on the other hand, maybe it's just something to hint
3669400	3673640	that there's a Virtual Console service coming on the switch. Well, Nintendo hasn't said anything
3673640	3680520	about Super Nintendo or GameCube. Well, actually, what I think this would really be for would be
3680520	3686040	Wii and GameCube. I think if we're going to go, why wouldn't they just sell the freaking Wii games
3686040	3690680	like they were doing on Wii U for a little bit? Why not sell those full functional games? Maybe
3691240	3695640	though, since there's no infrared bar, maybe it's not as easy as I think it is. Although wouldn't
3695640	3699560	those controllers be able to emulate the function, but they couldn't tell where you were pointing,
3699560	3704840	could they? Because there's no infrared sensor. It would be very difficult. Yeah.
3705800	3710040	Some games would work that didn't maybe use the infrared. So like, you know, you could do like
3710040	3714520	an excite truck or something like that, but then you would need to. And also there's, you remember,
3714520	3721480	there's the games that they had on the Nvidia Shield in Korea or China or wherever the hell it
3721480	3727800	was where they actually had Wii games. And some of those did work. Like I can't remember. I don't
3727800	3731560	remember how they got around. I think what they did as far as like the pointer stuff, they just
3731560	3736760	use the second analog stick as the pointer on the screen. So you just would have like a cursor or
3736760	3741480	something like that. So maybe that would work, but it's not going to work for all games, but not
3741480	3746920	every single game use motion controls either. So it may work for some things. Okay. Good to know.
3747800	3751400	All right. Well, let's move on just a couple more stories before we get to the classic game
3751400	3758920	of the week. Loki. All right. So PlayStation is not going to be doing a PlayStation experience
3758920	3766280	for 2018. They are going to be skipping 2018 and waiting until next year. So they said for 2018,
3766280	3769000	I know this is going to be a disappointment for some people, but we decided not to hold
3769000	3776360	the PlayStation experience this year. We wouldn't have had enough to bring people all together in
3776360	3781080	some location in North America to even have an event. We don't want to set the expectations
3781080	3788120	really high and then not deliver on it. So interesting that they're not going to be doing
3788120	3792280	anything. I mean, I guess it makes sense. They kind of released a bunch of stuff already. Maybe
3793320	3800200	the other stuff that they showed is just not ready yet. But guess what? Microsoft has your back
3800200	3808680	because they've got XO 18 coming November 10th and 11th to Mexico City. So it's going to be the
3808680	3815480	fourth annual Xbox Fan Fest. So PlayStation is not having a fan fest, but Microsoft is.
3815480	3821560	And it's interesting about the Microsoft one is it's not in the U.S., Europe. They're having it
3821560	3826360	in Mexico. So it's kind of interesting how Microsoft is trying to appeal to a broader
3826360	3831160	global community. Yeah. Kind of what that says to me. And then, of course, they're going to show
3831160	3836040	they said they're going to have the largest Inside Xbox episode ever. During that time,
3836040	3840280	there's going to be some first looks and surprise live streams. And they're going to be doing some
3840280	3845640	coverage through Mixer throughout that weekend. So basically, they'll be doing some announcements,
3846440	3849880	maybe. I mean, I don't know how high you want to set the bar, but maybe akin to
3850600	3855800	what they were doing at PSX when they were doing PSX in the winter. Remember how they would do
3855800	3860840	quite some big unveiling at that expo and maybe they just didn't have the unveiling this year.
3860840	3866440	What do you think caused Sony to say not this year? Maybe they just had a lot of maybe they
3866440	3871640	just released a bunch of games and so they don't really have like maybe The Last of Us 2 and
3872360	3874920	the other games that they were showing off at E3 are just not.
3876120	3879240	I mean, I guess they could do the E3 demos and stuff, but they didn't want to recycle
3879240	3885960	the same thing. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Let's see. Going to chat at live.vognetwork.com
3885960	3890280	actdeft, who's in Mexico, but obviously Mexico is a very big place is in a very different part.
3890280	3894120	He says, I kind of want to go to the XO18 event, but it's too close to plan. And I have stuff to
3894120	3899800	do that weekend. So he probably want to get out there. It sounds like, but that's still kind of
3899800	3905800	neat that we'll have that convention and can watch a feed on. Hopefully the feed is in English or
3905800	3909960	we'll have subtitles or translate or something. Yeah, hopefully. So we can understand whatever
3909960	3912920	the announcements are. That would be pretty exciting. But I do find that very interesting
3912920	3918280	that maybe Microsoft's targeting a more global type of build. If they're losing the war in Japan,
3918280	3923080	why not try to win it in Latin America? You know, it's interesting. It's interesting. It's
3923080	3929160	interesting tactic. We'll see how it works. All right. Anyhow, let's talk about some more of the
3929160	3936680	fallout from Telltale's sudden closure. Stranger Things over on, which was a game that Telltale
3936680	3941000	was supposed to be doing for Netflix. Netflix has come out and said, they're still going to do it.
3941000	3946040	They're still moving ahead with the Stranger Things game. They said in a statement, we are
3946040	3950360	saddened by news about Telltale games. They develop many great games in the past and left
3950360	3954280	indelible mark on the industry. Minecraft story mode is still moving forward as planned. We are
3954280	3958760	in the process of evaluating other options for bringing the Stranger Things universe to life
3958760	3963400	in an interactive medium. So they're not letting that go. And did you see that tweet from Devolver?
3963400	3968360	Where Devolver was basically like, if you want to give it to us, we'll do it. And we'll hire
3968360	3972280	former Telltale devs to help. And they were, they already knew what studio would do it too.
3972280	3978200	Is there studio that did code or something? Yeah. No code. So, um, yeah, I thought that was very
3978200	3982280	interesting. So, uh, we'll see where this game ends up. And I think that would be very cool
3982280	3988360	if some, uh, Telltale people were able to get, get jobs, uh, uh, helping to build this. Although
3988360	3992120	I think that developer was in Europe. So some people may not want to uproot all the way to
3992120	3995880	Europe, but maybe, you know, something, maybe something can be workable. Who knows? Um,
3997160	4001720	other news about Telltale though, and this is the part that in some ways I think is more fascinating,
4001800	4008840	uh, just to me to kind of watch, like all this news kind of going out is because, um, so people
4008840	4013640	bought the full walking dead season in advance with the expectation that the walking dead
4013640	4019160	episode one, two, three, four, the final season would be released as they've always been. But
4019160	4024680	Telltale closed right before episode two came out. Episode two still came out because like,
4024680	4027640	it was the Friday before the Tuesday it was supposed to come out. So it was probably in
4027640	4031720	the box ready to go, so to speak. So episode two still came out, but we have no plan. We have no
4031720	4035880	word on how they're going to get episode three and four out, or if they will, because they basically
4035880	4040360	already sold this to some people. Uh, so some people are pissed off because essentially it's
4040360	4045240	stolen money. If these games disappear, it's basically stolen money. But on the flip side,
4046600	4050920	if Telltale were to continue to develop these games, which by the way is the statement from
4050920	4055720	Telltale that says, hi everyone, we have a walking dead update for you. Multiple potential partners
4055720	4058680	have stepped forward to express interest in helping to see the final season through to
4058680	4062440	completion. We can't make any promises today. We're actively working towards a solution
4062440	4065960	that will allow episodes three and four to be completed and released in some form.
4065960	4069800	In the meantime, episode two will release tomorrow across all platforms as planned.
4069800	4075080	We hope to have answers for your other questions soon. So, okay, either they're going to turn it
4075080	4079320	over to another developer who's expressed interest in buying it for a share of the profit or
4079320	4082840	something, or maybe they're going to outsource it. I don't know, but at the end of the day,
4083720	4087320	then you have to kind of look at it and go, okay, well, they're going to deliver on this thing that
4087320	4092280	they sold, but at what price? Because they fucked over their developers that they fired
4092280	4098920	without severance. There's a class action lawsuit now because yeah, I saw that too. So, um, but now
4098920	4103080	it's like, okay, so even if they get these games finished, the people that are going to get paid
4103080	4107160	for it, is it going to be the people who really put their heart and soul into the story story and
4107160	4111400	the people who made it, it doesn't seem like it will be because those people were not given any
4111480	4117960	types of severance. So in a way, it's almost better if Telltale just like fucking doesn't
4117960	4123080	do the followups and offers to refund the money, which they probably can't do. We all know they
4123080	4128360	can't do because of this bankruptcy, this sudden thing they've done. So the executives at Telltale
4128360	4135080	fuck the company pretty good. And unfortunately, fuck the customers, fuck their employees,
4135080	4141560	and now, you know, who knows what's going to come of this? Who would have thought, you know,
4141560	4146120	at the beginning of the year, we'd be talking about Telltale like this, who would have thought?
4146120	4150680	I know it's crazy, right? Well, some people would have tell you this was a long time coming,
4150680	4154760	but that's neither here nor there. Anyway, apparently things haven't been running well
4154760	4160360	there for quite some time, but anyway, I'm not one to go. So anyway, let's, let's go back to a
4160360	4164760	time when you know what, it was just, it was, it was more nor there wasn't episodic games. There
4164760	4170440	was cartridge games and you got one. That's it. We're going to take a step back in time and we're
4170440	4175960	going to go way back in time. Thanks to radio magic and check out the classic game of the week.
4178360	4184440	And so we travel back in space and time to bring you the classic game of the week
4184440	4188840	where dark soccer is going to join us via Skype this week. Hi Jamie, how are you?
4188840	4194600	I'm all right. How are you? I'm good. You don't have to lie to the listeners. You've been under
4194600	4200840	the weather. That can't be super good. Yeah. I have a sinus infection, which as usual,
4200840	4207480	it goes right into my lungs. Well, I'm glad you could fight all that to still join us
4207480	4212760	this week here on Orange Laundry to bring us the classic game of the week. Because as I always say,
4212760	4217000	you step into the gaming vault and find a game that you've been playing where you're like, Hey,
4217080	4221560	you brats play this game or I'm going to punch you in the face. So what is the classic game
4221560	4228120	of the week? Popeye. Yay. I love, I love this game. This is one of those games where
4230280	4234040	I was just, this is one of those games where how have we not done this game before?
4234040	4240760	I love this game. No idea, but I'm going to punch people the way that Popeye punches vultures
4241480	4249640	by eating some spinach. Although canned spinach is gross. True story. When I was a kid,
4249640	4254920	my mom used to buy the Popeye brand canned spinach so that my brothers and I would eat it.
4255560	4258920	Oh, I can't. Spinach is like the grossest way to do it.
4259880	4265960	It is totally gross, but it works when you're making lasagna though. And it works in this game.
4265960	4273400	Yes. So Popeye came out in 1983 and it was developed and released by Nintendo.
4274680	4278040	Of course, based on Popeye from King, a future syndicate.
4281320	4289480	As a platformer though, you couldn't jump, you had a punch button. So it also was licensed by
4289480	4297880	Atari to be released in the UK and Ireland. And it actually had an Atari cabinet for them as well.
4300040	4307000	It also was supposed to be eventually what became Donkey Kong. The characters were going to be used
4307000	4313080	in another game, but Nintendo couldn't get a license for it. So then Donkey Kong came around.
4314040	4318920	So into the actual gameplay, you have to collect a certain number of items that are
4318920	4328680	dropped by olive oil. 24 hearts, 16 music notes, or 24 letters in the word help. You have to avoid
4328680	4336520	the sea hag, Bluto or Brutus as he was in this one and other, you know, things. He walks back
4336520	4340840	and forth and up and down the stairs. They use a four-way joystick. There's a punch button,
4341800	4349400	but no jump button like in other games. He can jump down a level, well Brutus can jump down a
4349400	4356520	level, or stoop and reach the levels below. He can also reach Popeye on levels above.
4358520	4363800	Your enemies that you have, apart from, you know, the big bads like the sea hag and them,
4364120	4368680	are vultures, which, you know, whatever game, can you punch a vulture in the face?
4370360	4376680	Skulls and bottles. And then you can get a can of spinach in each level. They'll get Popeye
4376680	4383400	invincibility and they can knock out Bluto Brutus by running into him, although he will swim back
4383400	4391480	out and try to, you know, get you again. Round one is the dock and you have a three-round cycle
4391480	4398040	that takes you off to different levels. And then the four-round cycle is you have the pogie bag,
4398040	4403960	which you can knock loose a barrel to get stuff out of. The barrel can also fall on Brutus's head.
4404520	4410360	You get points for that too. So other characters in the game, you also have olive oil, like I said,
4410360	4416840	sweet pea and wimpy, you know. I will gladly pay you tomorrow for a burger today.
4417400	4424600	And then, you know, you get, you lose life if you were hit by any of the baddies.
4425160	4430200	There were other releases. There were ports to the TRS-80, Color Computer 2,
4430200	4439000	Commodore 64, the TI-99-4A, Atari 8-bit, Intellivision, Atari 2600, Atari 5200,
4439000	4444120	ColecoVision, which was one of the good versions of it. And it was also one of the games that was
4444120	4451000	ported to the Odyssey 2. There is a board game based on this that came out in 1983,
4451000	4458120	and a Popeye tabletop video game with a color LCD, but it was not based on the arcade game.
4459080	4466600	It also was released later on in 1983 for the Famicom along with Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr,
4466600	4473080	ported by Parker Brothers, except for the Nintendo version that was handled by Nintendo itself,
4473080	4481560	the NES, sorry. It was, basically it even had a sequel for the Famicom that came out
4482600	4490120	on November 22, 1983, which was Popeye no Eigo Asobi, which basically translates to
4490120	4498760	Popeye's English Game, which also came out along with the later Donkey Kong Jr. Math.
4499720	4506120	And Namco did one in 2008 where they did an enhanced remake for mobile phones
4507080	4515640	that also had a bonus stage, and then an extra level that actually played to a Popeye short
4515640	4521240	called A Dream Walking, where Popeye had to save the sleepwalking olive oil and had some
4521240	4526760	trivia stuff in there. And then you could earn tokens, which you used to buy old comic strips
4526760	4532520	from, you know, the Simple Theater that later became the full Popeye shorts. And there you go.
4534120	4538840	All right. That was the game. I love this game. I had this on Commodore 64,
4538840	4541960	so that's the version I remember. And I don't remember being very good, but,
4542520	4547640	you know, just kind of like looking back on this game, I can't believe how much the computer gets
4547640	4554280	to cheat because Bluto can't, you know, he can kind of get you above, he can get you below,
4554280	4557720	so you kind of have to really like watch out for him or like psych him out and try to get him to
4557720	4562440	go early. And now I'm watching this playthrough that we're getting the music from, and I didn't
4562440	4566680	even remember this. Maybe the Commodore 64 version wasn't programmed for this. But once you get
4566680	4572360	through that three round cycle, you go back to the first port, obviously, with the hearts,
4572360	4578360	and now I see that the Sea Hag is throwing skulls at you as if the bottles weren't enough.
4578360	4584040	Yeah, and don't forget vultures too. Yeah, the vultures are in the last,
4584040	4589480	they're in the pirate ship, the help stage. Yeah, but you can punch them in the face.
4589480	4593480	You can punch them. I was actually watching the player in this video is punching the
4593480	4597000	vulture in the face pretty much as much as possible. It's pretty impressive.
4598200	4605000	Yeah, there it is. All right. Your classic game of the week, Popeye for originally the arcade,
4605000	4610200	but then was really released everywhere else in the 80s. As Jamie outlined everywhere that it
4610200	4616280	could be in the 80s, even the Odyssey two. So we have a little extra time here, but I know
4616280	4619960	you're sick and want to go soon. But I thought I would bug you a little bit because I know,
4619960	4623000	didn't you end up going to the Transformers thing still on Thursday?
4624200	4628600	Yes, I did. Well, we'd had our tickets for a month. There's no way I was missing that,
4628600	4633640	although I did have to step out halfway through the movie. Sure. But I came back in time for
4633640	4640920	dare to be stupid. Which if you don't make that the the fortune cookie, I'm going to cry.
4641720	4646200	I will try my best to remember. But between the time that we're taping this and the time
4646200	4650920	the show is live, I may I may forget. So maybe the chatters have to text you to pester you.
4650920	4655400	What's that? I will text you to pester you. That's a great idea. I always
4655400	4660440	appreciate a text message from Dark Sakura. I treasure everyone. I have a folder.
4660840	4666840	Like the ones where I harass you at work. The thing is, she's not lying.
4669560	4671560	Rob, I found this meme. Coffee.
4673960	4677320	All right. And you're still Trixie Mattel on my phone.
4677320	4680200	Yeah, you're still Katya on my phone. Heart. Yay.
4684120	4687960	Any parting thoughts for the listeners as we go back to the present time?
4687960	4694920	Well, I wanted to say one thing actually about seeing Transformers the movie is that
4694920	4698040	a bunch of people did actually stay in the theater to watch the whole credits.
4698760	4704040	And after the movie, there was actually an interview with Stan Bush, who did, you know,
4704040	4709480	the touch and saying dare in the movie. But he's talking about just, you know,
4710120	4716200	how those songs kind of changed the course of his music and how it was actually recorded for
4716200	4719400	the movie Cobra with Sylvester Stallone. Oh, wow.
4721000	4724280	Yeah. And then he's like, it ends up in some cartoon. Hey, this is pretty cool.
4728440	4733640	All right. Well, I'm gonna have to get my tickets for next time, I guess, since I missed it this
4733640	4738360	time. But, you know, Jamie, I do have my tickets for Gaga's Star is Born. So I'm very excited
4738360	4745160	about that. I kind of want to see it because I haven't. I did see like the one that wasn't
4745160	4749480	like the 70s. The Barbra Streisand one or the Judy Garland one?
4750520	4753400	The Barbra Streisand. Okay. You know, the interesting thing?
4753400	4757720	Because of Barbara and she's like Butta. She is like Butta. The interesting thing,
4757720	4761800	I'll leave you with this little random ass fact that has nothing to do with games, but deal with
4761800	4767240	it. So, you know, this is gonna be the fourth Star is Born movie because there was the Judy
4767240	4773640	Garland one, the Barbra Streisand one, and there was one in the 1930s. Well, the Star is Born from
4773640	4781560	the 1930s is public domain now. So because I guess the license was never renewed or something
4781560	4786600	happened with it, where it didn't like it is now in the public domain. So you can actually watch
4786600	4791880	the entire like Star is Born from the 1930s like on Wikipedia and stuff and on YouTube because it's
4791880	4794440	public domain. That's cool.
4794440	4800840	Kind of interesting, huh? Little random fact. Yeah. Maybe that's something that we should do
4800840	4804680	one night is just have classic movies. Yeah. And we can stream it.
4805640	4808200	Yeah, because they're public domain. With commentary.
4808200	4813640	You could do that. And there's some. There's a few modern movies that fall in that category,
4813640	4818280	too. Like Wikipedia has a whole article on it. Like, you know, do what I do and stay up until
4818280	4824520	2 a.m. reading random Wikipedia articles. And there's a Wikipedia article on movies that are
4824520	4829800	in the public domain and why. It's fascinating. I wonder if any of our listeners would like that,
4829800	4833800	like on our twitches. Like, watch Rob and Jamie watch old shit.
4833800	4838680	Why not? Let us know in our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord. Cheap plug.
4839320	4840200	Do it.
4840200	4843400	All right. Any party shots here, Jamie, while we go back?
4845560	4846680	I like Sudafed.
4853160	4857560	Thanks, Jamie. And I hope the Sudafed is working and you're feeling much better.
4857560	4862600	Meanwhile, we've got some more gaming news to get into, including some rapid fire news before
4862600	4867480	we get to your calls. Still on Skype for now at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. But
4867480	4872840	the first Loki wants to start us off with some rapid fire news. So there's been an announcement
4872840	4877480	that Castlevania Symphony of the Night and Rondo of Blood will be coming out on PlayStation 4
4878120	4883400	October 26. It's going to be a collection of the two games for the first time available digitally
4884040	4887240	together. And that's coming out on the 26th of October.
4887240	4890040	Well, it's kind of a lie because didn't they do this on the Vita?
4891800	4895160	I don't think they were together, though. I thought they were together on the Vita.
4895160	4897240	Oh, well, it doesn't matter. Whatever the case may be.
4897240	4900040	We have confirmation on that thing that leaked last week.
4900040	4906280	Yes, exactly. So neat. Check it out. I don't like the fact that their letterbox,
4906280	4910360	or not letterbox, but like in a frame. I wish they had a way to like, you know,
4910440	4914680	enhance it or something like that. But going to chat at live.vognetwork.com,
4914680	4919000	Dark Tetsuya says, I'm mad it's a Sony exclusive, but what can you do? Frown.
4919000	4922520	You know, that's a good point. I saw some people kind of bellyaching on Twitter a little bit about
4922520	4926840	that. I shouldn't say a negative word like that, but, you know, some people giving feedback on
4926840	4933320	Twitter that, you know, it's weird that they just announced Simon for, you know, Super Smash
4933320	4939480	Brothers Ultimate. And yet the Switch, none for you buy. This is a PlayStation exclusive.
4939560	4943480	Maybe a timed exclusive. You never know. Could be. Maybe. Maybe they've got something
4943480	4946360	else in store for the Switch. Don't hold. Don't lose hope.
4947560	4951800	There's a lot of those DS games of the Green Master that, you know, pretty good. So.
4955240	4959480	Then, of course, another flashback console. But you may be asking, well, what,
4959480	4965160	what possible system could this be for? And the answer that I have no fucking clue because it's
4965160	4971720	a bunch of games and they're just from fucking everything. So it's called the Legends Flashback
4971720	4977800	Consoles coming out October 1st. So tomorrow, it's because it's a hodgepodge of licenses from
4977800	4984280	like Capcom and like Taito. I don't remember all that. Yeah, it's a Capcom Bandai Namco.
4984280	4992280	There's Tetris, Data East, Acclaim. So you got a big bunch of games all kind of jammed in there.
4992280	4996840	So what can you expect with it? Well, they've got stuff like Bad Dudes versus Dragon Ninja,
4997400	5002280	Burger Time, Super Burger Time. That's all I need. I'm good. Let's get it. Galaga,
5002280	5009960	you know, Joe and Mac, Mappy, Mega Man 1 and 2. They have Super Street Fighter 2, Strider.
5012440	5018920	Of course, Tetris and lots of other things. Total of 50 games in all.
5018920	5024760	And how much is it going to cost? I have no idea because they didn't mention that.
5024760	5030120	But it will be HDMI, have Safe States and Rewind. And it looks like they have Sega Genesis type
5030120	5039080	controllers. So hooray. Hooray. All right. Christmas gift. Yeah, it might be if you just
5039080	5043720	aren't getting enough retro consoles. There you go. Guess what? There's probably another one coming
5043720	5049800	because Liquid Media out of Vancouver just purchased the rights to 65 classic video game
5049800	5055960	titles, potentially opening the door to revival. So this company Liquid Media has gotten some of
5055960	5060760	the properties which include Bust to Move. Sadly, not the dancing game. We're talking about Bubble
5060760	5066040	Bobble because that would be the same franchise. NBA Jam also in this as well. Yeah, that's kind
5066040	5069080	of probably the most interesting one that they have. I thought EA would have had the rights to
5069080	5072520	that. You would think, but I guess for whatever reason, no, maybe it was because it was actually
5072520	5077160	Midway. EA was maybe you had it for a short time, but they let it lapse because they did
5077160	5081720	any jam. But now they've got their street thing instead, which is basically NBA Jam. Well, they
5081720	5088760	had NBA Street beforehand. Yeah. And Street is now part of NBA Live. And then, of course, they did
5088760	5094920	NFL Blitz and NBA Jam, but I don't think neither either of those were pretty good. So. So anyway,
5095640	5099960	they are making some comments on, you know, basically acquiring this and it's the acquisition
5099960	5103400	is going to help build the catalog. But what I think is interesting. OK, here's the thing.
5103400	5108200	So the chairman of Liquid Media Group, the chairman of Liquid Media Group is Joshua Jackson,
5109160	5117240	the actor from Doss's Creek. Remember? Yes. I did not know that's where he went because I was like,
5117240	5121080	I haven't seen him. And so what ever happened to that guy? Oh, this is what happened to that guy.
5122920	5126520	So anyway, you might be interested what he has to say if you want to know what was the name,
5126520	5131480	Pacey was Pacey's name. Anyway, he said, so many people, myself included,
5131480	5135880	are returning to the classics. The nostalgia brought on by this resurgence in retro games
5135880	5141080	connects us to our childhoods and creates incredible demand. So if I had the money to
5141080	5147080	buy rights for games, I would buy rates to games. See it. Tiberi wants to remind us.
5147080	5152360	Fringe was a very important. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yeah. There you go. Complete forgot he was in
5152360	5157960	that anyway. Speaking of throwbacks, DDR's 20th anniversary. So last week we had the countdown
5157960	5163480	clock. Now we know what it is. It's basically a throwback mode on DDR Ace machines. So what
5163480	5168360	happened is that basically they unlocked these new categories. I knew they call. Yeah. What
5168360	5173320	are they called folders of folders? So there's like a a folder to represent one, two, three,
5173320	5177880	four and fifth mix, a folder to represent Max Max to an extreme and a folder represent Supernova and
5177880	5183560	Supernova two. Uh, and then you have, and I think they have X in there as well to X and X two,
5183560	5187800	they do X, X two and X three versus second. Uh, and then I guess technically there is a folder
5187800	5192920	for 2013 and ACE, which I mean, why not? It's reference. It's all of the other songs, but it's
5192920	5197720	just okay. But here's the bummer. So it has the folder that represents one, two, three,
5197720	5201960	four, and five, obviously like near and dear to my heart, because that was when you and I were
5201960	5207720	playing DDR like a lot when those was your bed, but it's like two mixes of paranoia,
5207720	5212280	which that song has played the fuck out trip machine. Brilliant to you, which is cool.
5212280	5217080	Still in my heart. I mean, it's kinda, it's like, it's nine songs, all this shit. That's
5217080	5222600	been on every single mixture. It's basically every now key song and all his pseudonyms.
5225560	5228680	But then when you get into max, yeah, it's basically every now key song you could ever
5228680	5234680	imagine. Uh, and B for you is, uh, in the, these little throwbacks, but it's, it's still cool.
5234680	5239240	I know I'm being a bitch, but it's really, it's pretty cool that you can go back and play max 300
5239240	5243960	1998 bag, what they do though. So the style, the classic backgrounds. Yeah. Well,
5243960	5248360	the styles are different too. So like you pay the first, uh, I think like the second mixed stuff
5248360	5254360	or whatever, it actually does it in flat where, you know, everything looked like it did before
5254360	5258520	the fail screens and the warrant screens are the same. Even in the max mode, they have that
5258520	5263240	warning shark thing, which I completely forgot because it's not in, you know, extreme. Um, but
5263240	5266920	they have those in the backgrounds and stuff. I like the backgrounds better than the dancers,
5266920	5270840	to be honest. I've seen the dancers in the last few games. That's just some weak shit.
5270840	5277160	Because we just don't want to create art. So we just, you know, default. I get it.
5277160	5280200	They have that in other games too, but orange right in chat says,
5280200	5282600	I hope this is still around the next time I go to round one. I have to do,
5282600	5286840	I'm actually going to be going to round one on Friday because Delvin has never been to one.
5286840	5291080	So we're going to go over there and Dave and busters too. Oh, that's true. But still,
5291080	5294200	we're going to go to round one just cause you know, he's never been. And I want to,
5294200	5301080	I'll probably, it's been a while. Yeah. I'm going to go on the Bay area at the end of the month,
5301080	5307720	but, um, I don't think I'm gonna get to round one. All right. Well, good luck. I have a family
5307720	5312440	in tow. So, you know, Oh, family always getting in the way. All right. Let's, uh, let's check
5312440	5316520	out some things that maybe Loki can stay home and play, uh, as they are coming out in stores this
5316520	5323880	week. Yes. So this week we've got, um, starting off with Astro bot rescue mission on PlayStation
5323880	5330200	four. We have Batman, the enemy within that's on Nintendo switch four is a horizon four on
5330200	5337960	windows 10 PC and X-Box one, uh, fist of the North star lost paradise on PlayStation four
5337960	5346600	mega man 11 on PC switch PlayStation four and X-Box one, uh, valve theory in arc hero school
5346600	5354440	story on PC switch and PlayStation four assassins creed odyssey on PC PlayStation four and X-Box one
5355000	5363000	super Mario party on the switch. And that's it. And actually it was funny. Um, cause I,
5363000	5366920	I got kind of scared for a second there when I read super Mario party is not going to be,
5366920	5372760	it does not work in handheld mode, which I was like, ah, but it's apparently you have,
5372760	5376600	you can do it in tabletop mode. You just can't do it with the controllers attached,
5376600	5381480	which is fucking stupid, but whatever. Oh, it's because isn't it because that whole new thing
5381480	5385400	where you put the screens next to each other, like, uh, that's supposed to be a big selling
5385400	5390040	point for Mario party. But if you play it on TV, you can't do that. So it's, I think it's because
5390040	5394120	the games require motion controls and it's kind of hard to do that with the screen attached. Okay.
5394120	5398120	That makes sense though. That'd be my guess. Yeah, no, it makes sense. I was like, ah, crap. I can't
5398120	5403160	get it for the kids. Now it's cause the motion, but then I was like, ah, it's fine. All right.
5403160	5407720	So I'm sure some people will be checking out super Mario party, uh, and, and all new friendships
5407720	5411880	thanks to super Mario party. Yes, it might. I will be getting that and probably for a surprise
5411880	5418040	before and maybe make a man 11. I don't know. I mean, wait for sale for making male 11.
5418920	5422600	All right. Well, let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases there. So
5422600	5427000	assassin's creed is actually getting a release. Assassin's creed odyssey gets a Japanese release
5427000	5430760	the same time we get it. So they're actually getting that a little bit early on October 2nd
5430760	5434040	and then their normal release day, which would be the fourth. They get rock man 11,
5434040	5438600	which of course is mega man. Uh, they get a game on PlayStation four called Astro bot rescue
5438600	5442840	mission. And lastly, uh, I think this is a price reduction. I think this game is already out,
5442840	5449480	but Senran Kagura Estival versus show Jotachi no Sentaku, which is going into a series called
5449480	5454760	best up, which I'm not familiar with, but I think that just means it's, you know, yeah. Cause it's,
5454760	5460520	it's like the equivalent of 1999 in Japan. And if you want to know what this game is, it's, uh,
5461000	5467800	it's everyone knows that Senran Kagura is it's big enemy titties. Is it? Okay. That's all it is.
5467800	5472520	I was gonna say they're going to the beach fan service. The game is going to the beach.
5472520	5476840	You know where that's going? I mean, I'm sorry. They're ninjas, ninjas.
5478520	5481880	It's their bikinis all the time. Too gay to know what you're talking about. Sorry.
5481880	5488600	Uh, let's go to, and that is literally my excuse. All right. Going to the Nintendo switch.
5488920	5493960	Rockman 11 is, uh, out of course, as it's on the switch as well as the PlayStation and all that
5493960	5500200	we know this week. Um, switch also has a game called Sumiko Gurashi Atsumare Sumiko Town.
5500200	5504840	It comes out this week on the switch. Otherwise Rockman would be probably the big release over
5504840	5510600	there, uh, on the switch this week. Don't see anything on the 3DS this week. Um, except I guess
5510600	5517400	the amiibo figure would work on the 3DS, uh, for Rockman. Um, if you wanted to get trash items and
5517400	5521880	games or that, you know how, like, if the amiibo isn't supported in a certain game,
5521880	5526120	it'll still give you something trash. It gives you e-tanks. Yeah. Well, no, I'm not even talking
5526120	5530200	about with making man 11 specific specifically, but like say you're playing breath of the wild
5530200	5534120	and you tap an amiibo that has nothing to do with Zelda or any of that. You just get like random
5534120	5537320	treasure, right? That's been a while since I've done breath of the wild, but you get random shit,
5537320	5541240	basically. So if you want to use your mega man amiibo to get random shit, you can do that. Even
5541240	5547640	on the 3DS. It is super handy though. And Odyssey to tap bowsers. I could see where the coins are
5547640	5552280	then missing. Yeah, I know some of the amiibo functionality is neat, but that's about it. All
5552280	5555880	right. Well, how about the UK? A dark soccer is not here, but can you help us out? UK is getting
5555880	5559400	pretty much the same stuff we got over here in North America. So fist of the North star
5559400	5565160	lost paradise coming out on PlayStation four for the horizon four on PC and Xbox one,
5565160	5571320	make me 11 on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one, Assassin's Creed Odyssey.
5572920	5578200	That's going to be on PlayStation four and Xbox one and PC. And apparently if you order from
5578200	5584680	game, you get it a few days early, whoopty shit. Astro bought rescue mission on PlayStation four,
5585240	5592040	a game called song of memories on the switch and PlayStation four, super Mario party and party on
5592040	5596600	the switch. And then they also have these Assassin's Creed Odyssey coming out the regular
5596600	5606120	time PlayStation four and Xbox one, which is, oh, the early access edition is $30 or 30 pounds more.
5607080	5610920	No. Oh boy. I hope it includes all the DLC or something. It's probably, yeah, it's probably
5610920	5615000	like a collector's edition or something. Oh, and I'm sorry. There's one more. Uh, we have, uh,
5615000	5618680	to be fair, it's the same thing for us is doing for us. It came out a few days. And apparently
5618680	5622280	they're doing the same thing with other games too. So we have mutant league football dynasty
5622280	5628600	edition on PlayStation four, Xbox one and the switch and WWE two K 19 early access as well,
5628600	5635320	which is going to be on PlayStation four, Xbox one PC. Um, that's a week early. This must be
5635320	5642440	the new norm. Pay more money for early access quite a bit. Yeah. And it's the 30, 30, 30 pounds
5642440	5646920	more. All right. Not worth it. Well, I mean, but, well, I mean, but again, like in the case
5646920	5650680	of Forza, like if you know you're going to get all the DLC, you know, you might as well,
5650680	5655160	you know, I, I kind of get it. I just assassin's creed. I don't know if I have that same commitment
5655160	5659160	to, this is such a busy week with all these games coming out. Like, you know, fours, uh,
5659160	5664040	SAS, this creed, mega man, like super Mario party. This is a huge week, you know, which
5664040	5667640	we're getting into that season. It's the first week of October. Here comes the holiday releases.
5667640	5672520	We got like call of duty in a few weeks and get ready. All out with 76,
5672520	5676440	Red Dead Redemption, all the big year, you know, there's a new Red Dead Redemption thing on Monday
5677080	5680120	Yeah. They're supposed to actually show more gameplay. That'd be nice.
5680920	5684120	They shouldn't have, I don't need to see a ton of gameplay or no, I'm going to get it. So
5685320	5690760	all right. That's all good. Let's go to the mailbag because every week you guys send us
5690760	5696280	emails and we read emails. And if you want to send emails, you should participate at orange
5696280	5701800	lounge, radio.com is the place to send us emails. Again, that's participate at orange lounge radio.
5702760	5707880	We got two emails this week. First one coming to us from Robert M. Robert M says not much to talk
5707880	5712840	about right now. Just wanted to send an email. Uh, I'm probably going to get Jack box party pack
5712840	5718680	five on switch instead of my old Mac book pro just for easier setup right now. Steam's only showing
5718680	5722600	the game for windows and steam box. Well, steam is not going to show it for the consoles because
5722600	5726360	they want you to buy it on steam, hoping to get more local multiplayer going in general.
5726920	5730680	Uh, so he brings up Jack box party pack five, which you haven't really talked a lot about on
5730680	5734360	the show, but I didn't realize they had the fifth one coming out. Oh yeah. Yeah, I know. Right.
5734360	5738920	It's like now it's become such a, Oh yes. We're used to hearing about a new one every year, but
5738920	5741800	this is the year that they're bringing back. You don't know Jack. So that's pretty exciting.
5741800	5746280	Oh yeah. Yeah. So, and then I think everything else is new. I think the, the, you don't know
5746280	5749960	Jack is the only kind of like revival game and everything else is new, but I'll get it because
5749960	5755800	those games, God, those games are so easy to just, you know, get a party going. I'm really glad that
5755800	5760680	like Jack box kind of like has their MO figured out with these yearly releases and they're doing
5760680	5764920	very well and everybody I know plays them. Even people that aren't like super big gamers
5765560	5770360	because they're like board games basically. Yeah. And so they kind of replace it's nice because
5770360	5774600	it's board games without having to have all the board games and without some asshole flipping the
5774600	5778040	board over in the middle of the game. And also without having to clean off your table to put
5778040	5783080	the board game on the table because it's decided to dump all their shit on the table as well as
5783080	5786680	the rest of the house. So there's no place to play board games anywhere. I feel like this is
5786680	5792200	turning into a venting session for you. It's just anybody with kids would know. I understand. Anyway,
5792200	5797000	continuing with Robert M's email, hopefully this isn't an irresponsibly dumb joke mess,
5797000	5804200	much less one I've already sent. What is Ryu's favorite music game? Taiko no Tazuuchan,
5804200	5807800	I think was how I was supposed to read that. I don't know. Anyway, that's pretty good. Robert
5807800	5811240	M you probably should have to send a voicemail or something in the future if you want it said
5811240	5815000	the way you wanted it said. So there you go. And that was a really dumb joke, but thank you.
5815000	5822040	All right, moving on. Email number two from serial emailer. I feel like I should have like a theme
5822040	5828040	that goes with this, but we always enjoy hearing from our pal YYR who says, hello, LR. I have to
5828040	5834520	agree with act devs call into last week's show. The recently announced PlayStation classic as a
5834520	5840440	product just seems unfinished or possibly half-assed. First of all, the fact that only
5840440	5844120	five out of the 20 promise games have been announced is kind of like a red flag to me.
5844760	5848680	Certainly Sony knows that folks will be lining up to pre-order this thing and that there's no
5848680	5853240	need to drip feed game announcements. Why hold them back? Is it because they're not even sure
5853240	5857800	yet themselves or are they afraid that the list won't be well received? It's just very strange
5857800	5862920	to me that we don't know about the majority of the games yet. I agree with this. Like why drip
5862920	5867400	feed this information? Cause it's a tease because then they can do the long, long game with
5867400	5875160	advertising. Nintendo is the king of teasing this shit way longer than is necessarily. They didn't
5875160	5879240	do this for the classic NES. Yes they did. Did they really? They did. They only announced some
5879240	5882360	of the games and they announced them later on. They did the same with the SNES classic too.
5882360	5886040	I thought we knew them all right out the gate. No, we didn't. We knew about some of them.
5886040	5891080	I know with the Switch thing, we only knew half out the gate and then we got the other half later
5891080	5895480	on. I'm pretty sure that it wasn't everything to begin with, but at the same time though,
5895720	5899640	is this thing targeting this year to come out or is it next year? I can't remember with the
5899640	5904680	PlayStation classic. It's this year. Are they trying to target holiday for this? I believe so,
5904680	5912520	yeah. I know, right? It's weird. Anyway, secondly in YYRS email, at least one of the five announced
5912520	5917160	games is a driving game that takes full advantage of analog controls. However, they're not including
5917160	5922360	dual shot controllers in the box. Thank you. Does this mean that they are going to sell them
5922360	5926920	separately as upgrades, pushing the final price of this thing even higher? It sounds a bit shady
5926920	5931240	to me, quite honestly. And since the majority of the later PS1 games use analog controls,
5931240	5934840	it makes me wonder if the whole thing is compromised because of it. Third,
5934840	5939960	YYRS laundry list of what were the problems of this thing. Sony seems to have missed a home run
5939960	5945160	here. They've built an ecosystem that houses literally hundreds of digital PS1 games. Why not
5945160	5949960	allow the PlayStation classic to connect to the PlayStation store where you could then download
5949960	5955800	any PS1 game you've already bought for no extra charge. Well, think about what you're saying YYR
5957000	5961160	and think about what Sony gets away with. And to be fair, what Nintendo gets away with too.
5962680	5967640	Or purchase more of them for the normal price of $6 each. Wouldn't this be kind of a no brainer?
5967640	5972520	They could even update the firmware to try to slow down hackers, which I suppose would be your
5972520	5976360	retort is that the hackers are going to, well, I mean, YYR, I guess that would be the retort
5976360	5979480	to the retort. Hackers are going to blow this thing wide open anyway. It doesn't matter.
5980200	5984920	It's going to happen. There's no way around it. It's probably going to happen much quicker
5984920	5988520	because I'm guessing, if anything, they're recycling the emulator from probably another
5988520	5991720	system like the PSP or the Vita or something like that. And they're going to adapt it for
5991720	5995640	whatever this is. It's got to have enough to onboard storage because if you think about it,
5995640	6001000	this is going to hold several disc worse of games. I mean, look at Final Fantasy 7 is three
6001000	6006520	discs already. And our four was two discs. And I'm trying to think with the other stuff that was
6006520	6013000	in there. I know there's other games that are multiple. Lots of games had lots of discs. Yes.
6013000	6018040	So there's lots of storage on this thing. I mean, just to hold all this. The question,
6018040	6021800	the answer is, I suppose you're going to be able to play all those games if you're willing to
6021800	6026520	resort to the darker side of the Internet, which I am ethically. Are you willing to do that at the
6026520	6030040	end of the day, though? Is it still worth it to pick it up to do that? I mean, because,
6031000	6034600	you know, didn't I kind of say this on last week's show, too? We were talking about this,
6034600	6041400	as I said, they really missed an opportunity to just shove Vita TV into this thing. And not that
6041400	6044840	I think the Vita TV is, you know, obviously, because we all know how Sony feels about the
6044840	6049880	Vita at this point, but you could have had PlayStation now, like you could have Trojan
6049880	6055000	horse that thing into this. And, oh, you get all these classic games and push this little button
6055000	6059240	here to charge your card. And you can play PlayStation three games and even more than just
6059240	6064840	the classics. Push now. Push now. Right. Like, I feel like Sony missed an opportunity or maybe
6064840	6070520	they didn't. We're about to find that out. But I just I feel like they sell these games backwards
6070520	6076680	compatible for the place. I know. You see the no, because, you know, it's because they've got
6076680	6081960	a copy Nintendo because look, it was like the top selling console, whatever. But here's the problem.
6081960	6087400	Like PlayStation four can't handle PS one games. It can. It can totally handle a PlayStation three
6087400	6092760	can handle the PSP can handle it. So this shit can fucking handle. But the problem is like,
6094200	6101480	here's the thing. Super Nintendo games and NES games, they look nice when you scale them up on
6101480	6107480	TV. And nowadays, you know, they look nice because it's just it wasn't rendering low poly stuff.
6108200	6115880	These games don't I don't think are going to be as well received as like those games. And I say,
6115880	6122040	I wonder the same thing about the Nintendo 64 classic, which is supposedly still happening,
6122040	6127160	because that may not be as fondly received as well, because those, you know, this is for as
6127160	6135160	blurry as shit. So I'm just worried that it's not going to be as like well received as the
6135160	6140520	SNES classic or the NES classic. I think if anything tend to be smarter to go with like a
6140520	6146040	Game Boy classic and have it portable or just fucking put the games out on the goddamn platforms
6146040	6149960	that you have so we can buy them. All right, calm down. Let me finish. Why is email here? So
6149960	6155080	why ends up here? Where did he? They could even update the firmware, try slow down hackers.
6155080	6158680	That's where we left off. So I also want to know more about the hardware before I even begin to
6158680	6163640	consider preordering the thing. Are the ports on the front USB? If so, can I connect to DualShock
6163640	6167800	three or four to them? Can I use the included controllers of the PC? These are all questions
6167800	6172040	that could represent either added value or missed opportunities. So yeah, the announcement of the
6172040	6175960	PlayStation classic just looks to me like a big bunch of questions. I hope they plan to answer
6175960	6181400	some of them before it releases, but you just never know, do you? Have fun YYR. Thank you for
6181400	6186920	the email. And honestly, we don't always agree YYR, but I'm with you 100% on this. In fact,
6186920	6192120	I think I named some extra things you missed, but you're right. There's the same reason why I didn't
6192120	6199800	preorder one. I just, I'm kind of burned out on the classic machines right now. I just, the early
6199800	6204600	PlayStation 1 stuff that didn't have DualShock is not like classic, I don't know, classic enough to
6204600	6210280	me right now. And like Final Fantasy 7, I think I called out last week as well. I was like, okay,
6210280	6215240	enough. Like how many fucking times are going to re-release Final Fantasy 7 when we know this
6215240	6220200	remake's on the horizon anyway, right? Didn't we just hear about the Nintendo Switch version and
6220200	6223480	we were supposed to get excited about that like two weeks ago? And now it's like, oh,
6223480	6230120	but it's in the PlayStation classic, like enough. So it's just, I don't know. It's,
6231880	6237480	I like R4, but I have it on my PC now. I played it through an emulator and I got to tell you,
6237480	6241880	it didn't look very good. I love R4. I think the real question, not look very good. I think the
6241880	6245880	real question is going to be, what does this thing look like when the hackers blow it wide open?
6245880	6251720	And that's, that's, admit it. That's what you all want to know. That's what you all want to know
6251720	6257640	is, you know, and, and to be fair, you know, I realize it's an ethical question because you're
6257640	6262040	downloading things you might not have paid for, but at the same time, many of you just want to be
6262040	6266200	able to play the PlayStation 1 games that are just collecting dust in your closet on the consoles
6266200	6271480	are currently hooked up to your TV. So if you are quote unquote stealing, maybe you're going to be
6271480	6277080	doing things you already own and want to play. Does it make sense? It's stupid. It really is.
6278120	6281480	Put Buster groove on this thing and I'll change my mind in a heartbeat,
6282680	6286760	but I just don't, I just don't see that happening. They're probably going to have wipeout on it,
6287480	6296440	but it's just like twisted metal, but Akuma JP in chat, uh, talking about final fantasy seven
6296440	6301000	over and over and over again, Akuma JP over at live.vogue.com says, but you get to see
6301080	6306680	Aerith die again. Who's complaining? Dark Chakra isn't here. He remasters of this shit. Like give
6306680	6311560	me a remaster of our four. I'll buy that shit on the PlayStation four. Give me a remaster of
6311560	6315240	like what happened to like where they were like, Oh well we can't do PlayStation two games,
6315240	6319720	but for some reason we can remaster them quote unquote. It's not really a remaster, but we put
6319720	6324840	them in its own emulator. They can't just push a button that says make remaster and it's going
6324840	6328920	to happen. Like they have to dedicate people time hours to that. So is it better that they're doing
6329000	6332120	stuff like that or working on new things? Like that's what, that's where the questions get
6332120	6337480	harder. It's not, it's an emulator. Just you create an emulator that can basically upscale
6337480	6342120	this stuff and then you're done. So, so yes, magic button. So yes, magic button because they already
6342120	6346840	have this shit on PC. It's been out for PC emulators have been able to do this shit for
6348200	6355720	years, decades. All right. I mean, come on. It's, it's ridiculous. Let's move on from that email
6355800	6359400	participate at orange launch radio.com. If you want to send us an email for a future week,
6359400	6362840	we will get to live calls as well in a little bit over at orange launch radio on Skype,
6362840	6366040	but we have some more news for you. I don't know if I'd call this first thing news,
6366600	6373320	but it's an internet thing. It's where every gamer has a voice and some gamers are using,
6373320	6378600	are choosing to use their voices in really ridiculous fucking ways. Right? Loki. Yes.
6378600	6386760	So it all began. Let's think back to last week when basically, actually a couple of weeks ago,
6387560	6395560	there was a Twitter user, um, by the handle, uh, Hanawa who put out a funny comic strip,
6395560	6402680	you know, showing basically the end of super Mario Odyssey, where both Mario and Bowser are
6402680	6407800	trying to woo the princess. And she's like, fuck off, you know, like she does in the game.
6407800	6414440	And both Mario and Bowser are sad. And then Bowser has this magical crown, which, you know,
6414440	6421960	created Peachette in the new, um, remaster of new Super Mario Brothers U because it's not
6421960	6427800	Toadette anymore. It's now Peachette and she's become this thing and it magically transformed.
6427800	6434040	Well, I'm all for getting rid of Toadette to start. Toadette was lame. Like, sorry, sorry about
6434040	6438840	it. But Toadette was always kind of lame. I hated her since Double Dash, which I believe
6438840	6442760	was her first appearance. And I hated her in Double Dash. And now every time I see Toadette,
6442760	6449640	I'm like, I have an irrational hatred of you. I can't explain. Sorry. So now thanks to this evil,
6451160	6456600	this, this crown that apparently has the magical ability to turn whoever wears the crown into some
6456600	6466440	fucking waifu anime big breasted chick. Um, so now we have Bowsette, Bowsette, the, the new
6466440	6473480	internet hentai rule three, four thing that they're just people are running well with now,
6473480	6478920	because not only is it just Bowsette, it's putting it on all the fucking creatures that you can think
6478920	6486280	of and turning them into sexy waifu anime chicks and everybody is going fucking bonkers over this
6486280	6492120	shit. Um, internet, we need to have a heart to heart talk because I've been using a lot of
6492120	6495000	social media this week because I use a lot of social media every week because I'm a social
6495000	6499960	media whore, like many of you. Uh, and I'm on Facebook a lot and I'm on Twitter a lot.
6499960	6505720	And as I've been scrolling this week, I've been seeing this over and over. And not only am I
6505720	6513480	seeing this, I'm seeing this turn into more shit like Boozette and, uh, gender swapped Bowsette,
6513480	6518120	which you think I wouldn't have a problem with, but yet somehow I do. And internet, I,
6518120	6524280	I'm going to need to ask you to knock this off. Like internet, please, please stop. No internet.
6524280	6533960	I need to stop it. I am this. Why? This is why old people get upset and yell at you to get off
6533960	6539640	their lawn because you do things like Bowsette that don't make any sense. Does it not make any
6539640	6546200	sense though? Because apparently there is the new art book called the art of super Mario Odyssey,
6546200	6552120	which is releasing this week in Japan. And apparently there's concept art of princess
6552120	6559320	Bowser straight from Nintendo. So Bowsette cannon question mark. Thanks. I hate it
6561160	6568040	because you know, Bowser basically has his own hat, which he can throw on things and it turns
6568040	6575240	them into Bowser, uh, over at, uh, our live chat room over at live.vog network.com. Brad from
6575240	6580520	pod culture says, where is Robert? Everybody say bye to Brad from pod culture. Who's just
6580520	6585960	turned a lifetime ban from the chat room. Say goodbye everybody. It's been very lovely knowing
6585960	6593720	him over these past few years. All right. And then already starting fast. Apparently not only
6593720	6599640	has there been, um, petitions, you know, to include Bowsette into smash, which will never
6599640	6606040	fucking happen, but there's going to be a Bowsette fan event being held in Japan on October 27th.
6607800	6613720	Gather with all of your fans. If they recently, wait, wait, wait, wait. There's already a
6613720	6624680	convention. This just, this just happened a week ago. Pornography is and OJC is very fast.
6625720	6631480	What is wrong with you? People spend money on something that makes sense.
6635080	6640360	People love put turning in anime objects into anime chicks. I mean, remember before this,
6640520	6648600	game consoles, planets. It's it's never going to end. It's never going to end.
6651960	6659720	Is that it? That's it for this week for this week. Moving on. Let's talk about something else. Let's
6659720	6663880	talk about dragon quest 11. Let's talk about the worst part of dragon quest 11, the soundtrack. Oh
6663880	6669640	yeah, I said it. The dragon quest 11 soundtrack. It's kind of stale and, um, I'm glad I'm not the
6669640	6675320	only one that thought this because apparently with the dragon quest 11 release on PC,
6675320	6680760	good old hackers and modders have decided to fix some of the problems of the music in the game.
6681320	6687400	Mainly they took the mini instruments, uh, and replace them with orchestra music. That's right.
6687400	6692360	It's dragon quest 11 orchestration overhaul mod. It was finished just over the weekend
6693320	6698120	and it replaces all the music with an orchestrated rendition. So it sounds a little more like, uh,
6698120	6703480	dragon quest eight, I suppose. Now you do have to have copies of the dragon quest 11 soundtrack
6703480	6708680	as performed by the Tokyo metropolitan symphony orchestra. So I guess they wanted to keep this
6708680	6712760	legit. So you do have to own those sound, but I'm sure you could find those soundtracks if you
6712760	6718680	wanted to be a very bad person, but it's such a way to do it. But anyway, they do say the goal
6718680	6723160	of this mod is to provide the proper auditory experience that is deserving of this masterpiece
6723160	6727800	of a game by applying all available orchestral variants of the songs present in the game
6727800	6732520	as composed by Kochi Sugiyama and performed by the Tokyo metropolitan symphony orchestra.
6732520	6737000	We do not contain or support piracy in any way, shape or form, and we will not provide the raw
6737000	6741400	music files for listening. I'm sure someone else will. So if you want that, you'll have to buy the
6741400	6745400	official symphonic suite albums. That being said, I want to follow up with something I was getting
6745400	6749400	into on Bobby Black Wolf show, and this will not make me popular, but I don't care because I'm
6749400	6753240	going to say what I'm going to say. And what I'm going to say is it is time for dragon quest to let
6753240	6760280	Sugiyama go. Dragon Quest XI was a flop as far as the soundtrack is concerned, and it just shows
6760280	6765800	that he cannot get past these same themes that have been going on for the past 10 games now.
6766440	6771400	I mean, part of my hatred could be fueled by his politics because he's an anti-gay guy if you
6771400	6774920	watch him on the television in Japan and stuff, and so maybe there's a little bit of that coming
6774920	6780840	into play. But honestly, play Dragon Quest XI, which for all purposes outside of the soundtrack
6780840	6786520	is a great game. Play it on PlayStation 4 and load up Spotify and, I don't know, listen to Robin
6786520	6789480	or something. It's probably going to take you out of the experience a little bit, but it's going to
6789480	6793640	be better than the original soundtrack. Play the game and tell me the soundtrack isn't terrible.
6793640	6800120	A downgrade from VIII, which was, unless you played it on 3DS, if you played Dragon Quest VIII
6800120	6805400	on the PlayStation 2, it was that full orchestral experience. And so playing Dragon Quest XI
6805400	6809880	honestly feels like a step backwards. And again, I said a little bit of this on Bobby's show at the
6809880	6816200	tail end when he called us, but Final Fantasy has moved on past Nobuo Uematsu. These are very
6816200	6821000	different scenarios, and I do not mean to speak ill of Nobuo Uematsu, especially coming off of
6821000	6826200	last week's Newsies, taking a break because he's sick. But as we know, he decided to move on from
6826200	6830040	the Final Fantasy series. Well, he still comes back to do, you know, like he does the theme or
6830040	6834360	he'll do one or two compositions every soundtrack, but he went on to do other games and other things
6834360	6838680	like Lost Odyssey, you know, other projects, things like that. Which we still need a sequel for.
6839400	6845720	That is true, but this is different. But my point is, Final Fantasy has still done fine with
6845720	6851720	different composers. Most notably, in my opinion, Final Fantasy XIV. If you fucking hate online
6851720	6856840	games, you still need to check out the soundtrack, if nothing else. Seriously, go look up some of the
6856840	6862920	songs from Final Fantasy XIV soundtrack, the new, the post Realm Reborn stuff by a guy named Soken.
6863560	6870200	It's probably the best music in the entire series, honestly. Now, to be fair, and I don't, again,
6870200	6875640	I don't want to speak ill of Uematsu, but a lot of the reason why XIV soundtrack is good is that
6875640	6880920	he takes elements of Uematsu's themes from the earlier games and really pushes them to the next
6880920	6888520	level. Like, I love the Stormblood opening title screen, which takes the Final Fantasy theme,
6888520	6892920	which Nobui Uematsu did, and puts like a pirate theme on it. It's awesome. It's a great, like,
6892920	6898440	it's very well done. So anyway, my point is, and XIII had a different composer, XV had a different
6898440	6903880	composer, and all the soundtracks since, I believe, he did part of the XI soundtrack,
6903880	6909480	and that was the last thing Nobui Uematsu did the full thing for. They've been fine. Dragon Quest
6909480	6917320	will be fine too. Let Sugiyama go and let somebody else do the soundtrack. That is my opinion,
6917400	6922120	whether you like it or not. How about your opinions over at live.vognetwork.com?
6922120	6926600	Dungeon Buster says, yeah, the Dragon Quest XI soundtrack is kind of stale. I found myself wishing
6926600	6931320	for more of Octopath Traveler's soundtrack while playing. Ooh, that's a really good call out too,
6931320	6935880	is that Square has other franchises with other composers that are very talented as well. It's
6935880	6941400	very, very good point. DarkTusia says, I do hope it's addressed on the Switch version. I know they
6941400	6945240	usually add things to a new port, like voice acting, so maybe they'll have room for a better
6945240	6949960	soundtrack. Let's hope. Bob Coffee says, the reason why Dragon Quest has the shitty MIDI
6949960	6955240	is because Sugiyama is an asshole and wants people to pay for concert or orchestral CDs.
6955240	6962360	Bob Coffee, this is the justification to fire him, in my opinion. Let him go. Somebody else can take
6962360	6968200	over this and can still incorporate the old shit into it, I'm sure, with the appropriate level of
6968200	6974040	throwback and so on and so on. So it'll be fine. Dungeon Buster says, Final Fantasy XII,
6974040	6979880	Hitoshi Sakamoto, who did the music for Tactics and Valkyria Chronicles. Yep, amazing stuff.
6979880	6986520	So there you go. My opinion on Dragon Quest XI, and clearly I'm not alone, not just you guys in
6986520	6990680	chat, but these modders that are like, what they put in the game is not good enough. It's really
6990680	6997320	not. Otherwise Dragon Quest, I mean, you know, and the soundtrack is, it's, it's just, it's just
6997320	7001640	not as good as it was me. It felt like regression. That's the most frustrating part about it,
7001640	7005320	considering, you know, Dragon Quest VIII was on the PlayStation fucking 2, and this is on the
7005320	7010760	PlayStation 4, to have the, everything else feels like progression. To have this feel like regression
7010760	7019640	is, is really stupid. Anyway, but hackers fixed it. Yay. Loki, let's move on to another story.
7021560	7026200	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
7026200	7035080	use the passphrase, heat. So this week, we had the Oculus event that was in San Jose,
7035640	7044440	and they announced the new Oculus platform called the Oculus Quest. It is a standalone VR headset.
7044440	7049480	You will not need a PC for this. It's basically going to be its own console. And with that,
7050360	7057000	it has a resolution of 1600 by 1440 per eye. It's going to come with a couple of the Oculus
7057000	7061560	Touch controllers, and it's going to have some sort of motion tracking in there as well.
7063000	7068200	I don't think it's got the actual sensors, like the normal Oculus Rift does, but it's kind of
7068200	7074280	like, it works in the reverse, basically the actual positioning track, positional tracking
7074280	7080360	will be done by the headset itself. It's supposed to retail for $400 for a 64 gigabyte model,
7080360	7083720	and they said that about 50 games will be supported at release. It's supposed to come
7083720	7088840	out in spring of 2019. Looks neat. I'm not sure if this would be something that I'm going to pick
7088840	7096920	up because I don't need another console, but that's definitely a good price point to, you know,
7096920	7101560	hopefully get people interested in VR stuff. Especially, I'd like to see other things this
7101560	7106920	could be used for, aside from just some of the games and everything. I always wanted like the
7106920	7114360	AR stuff with, you know, virtual desktop things and stuff, but I'm curious to see what's going
7114360	7119480	to be on the platform. Maybe see if this is gonna be like a major contender against like other
7119480	7123640	consoles or something. I just think with PlayStation VR being so easily accessible,
7123640	7128680	I just don't see Oculus, at least in the gaming space, really taking that crown. But, you know,
7128680	7132360	again, I think VR is still trying to find where the niche can be for everything else,
7132360	7136680	and that's a big part of the reason why Facebook wanted Oculus in the first place is, you know,
7137320	7141720	how could I maybe be like, how could Facebook bring a live concert experience and you could
7141720	7146840	sit there in your Oculus and really feel like you're there. But I just feel like we're not
7146840	7151800	seeing enough of that for like the common person right now. Right, and I agree with that, but also,
7151800	7155240	you know, with the PlayStation VR, though, you have to buy the console, which is, you know,
7155320	7160920	almost $400, and then you have to buy the headset, which is also, you know, pretty expensive.
7161560	7165720	Our pal Bobby in our chat, and you know he loves his VR, over at live.fognetwork.com says,
7165720	7170120	the tracking here is way better than PSVR's and is ultimately cheaper, or maybe even the same price.
7170760	7175640	Oculus venues already exist for Gear VR and Oculus Go, which is that concert thing. But like,
7175640	7182040	I get all that. I really do. But A, I mean, the price and the technology ain't gonna matter when
7182040	7187000	it comes down to the applications. And let's just put it this way, PlayStation VR has Tetris Effect
7187000	7194600	coming out. But this Oculus Star Wars. Okay, well, okay, so then this is where now they're trying to
7194600	7203800	so they have a Darth Vader game coming to Oculus quest called Vader Immortal. And it looks neat.
7203800	7212520	It's gonna be an episodic game, and apparently it says that you're playing as some person that
7212520	7218040	gets kidnapped by Darth Vader, and I don't know, you're also like some apprentice or something.
7219160	7224280	Neat. So you get to be the bad, you're Darth Vader's apprentice? You get to be a bad guy?
7224280	7231160	I guess so, yeah. But maybe you're just not a bad guy. I don't know, but it's a neat idea, and that's
7231160	7237880	definitely a good selling point. Okay, so this is not going to be fair, but it's where my head goes.
7237880	7242920	Because I go, well, everyone got real excited when they announced a Star Wars game for Kinect.
7244040	7252280	Look how that turned out. Not good. So, right, but let's be honest, the Kinect motion tracking
7252280	7257880	versus the motion tracking. Loki, my issues have nothing to do with how the tracking. No,
7257880	7261400	I understand. It's a stupid dance. It's like, well, we gotta pad this game out. Like, hey,
7261400	7267560	let's get the team behind Dance Central to make some content for it. And don't get me wrong,
7267560	7272360	they did the best that they could with what they had. I'm not faulting them because those songs,
7272360	7278760	as stupid as they are, it's still catchy. I'm hand solo. It's catchy, but you know what? So bad.
7278760	7283960	They did, it was not there. They were just following orders. No, they weren't, they were.
7283960	7289160	They were just doing what they needed to do to get paycheck. Some executive made a really poor
7289160	7294040	choice to do that, but I don't know. All right, well, I have to piggyback off that because
7294040	7298280	guess what? You want to talk about more exec decisions, things that were completely out of
7298280	7303640	the hands of the developers. You ready for this? Here's the development. Now you can get the,
7303640	7308920	I would say it's DLC basically, but it's not. It's just a weapon. So you can get a weapon in
7308920	7312680	Assassin's Creed Odyssey. So like, you know, put in a little code and get a weapon, right?
7312760	7317320	And you would expect, oh, a pre-order bonus or, oh, buying this at Best Buy. That's what we're
7317320	7321000	used to, to getting the special weapons and armor, right? Oh no, no, no, no. This one's really good.
7321000	7327160	So the way that you get this weapon is that you will get the code with Totino's pizza rolls.
7327880	7334040	That's right. You, or the, the, not that, they don't just do the pizza rolls. They do that
7334040	7338840	shitty like cracker pizza. That's like probably like a buck at Winco. That's, that's them too,
7338840	7345960	right? I don't know. We see those in college all the time. But anyway, so you, you can get a code
7345960	7350360	for Assassin's Creed Odyssey to get a special weapon for a limited time to get bonus in-game
7350360	7356440	items for the upcoming Ubisoft title. This deal is only good in the US. Sorry to everybody else
7356440	7362840	in other countries, but no pizza rolls for you. You can also get things like temporary XP boosts,
7362840	7368760	weapons. I guess the first code gets an XP boost. The second gets a Horn of Ares sickle sword,
7368760	7373960	and the third gets you a Bighorn bow. Every- You have to have like 12, I think, to get everything.
7373960	7379320	Well, cause you get XP boosts after that for everything else. And, and, you ready for this?
7379320	7386280	If you get them at Walmart, you get an additional bonus. That's right. You get the Ram Axe if...
7386280	7395880	I can't help, this is so stupid. You get the Ram Axe if you buy the only at Walmart,
7395880	7401000	120 count pizza rolls pack. Got all of those pizza rolls.
7403080	7406360	You know, they did this last year with Totino's had a-
7406360	7411400	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Brad from Pod Culture in chat. This needs to be, this needs to be responded to.
7411400	7416680	Says, shut your whore mouth, pizza rolls are awesome. When did I say pizza rolls aren't
7416680	7423000	awesome? Pizza rolls are fucking amazing. But still, there's something about the whole,
7423000	7428280	you gotta buy, you don't just have to buy a little box. You have to put 120 count pizza rolls box,
7428920	7435640	enough to feed an Assassin's Creed Odyssey army in order to get the Ram Axe.
7435640	7437320	Apparently I'm not trying hard enough.
7443480	7447240	Pizza rolls are better than gender rolls. I will, uh, I will say that.
7447240	7451800	Because like the word Assassin, pizza rolls will make your ass twice as big.
7453800	7459800	Are you ready to put the ass in Assassin's? We'll get that 120 count pack of pizza rolls.
7461000	7464760	They did this last year Shadow of War 2, and it was just as ridiculous then.
7466440	7471320	But remember, they need all the money. They're hurting. They can't make AAA games anymore
7471320	7478440	because they're not selling enough Super Ultimate Editions and pizza roll tie-ins and other nonsense.
7479800	7484520	All right. Admit it, Loki. Are you going to pick up the new Assassin's Creed? I don't like
7484520	7488760	Assassin's Creed. Well, this new one looks really good. I might pick it up. And you know what,
7488760	7491720	bitch? I might pick up some pizza rolls because pizza rolls are pretty good.
7491720	7495800	You're part of the problem, Rob. I can't help it.
7498040	7500680	Anyway, just a few more stories for you guys. Then we're going to open up the
7500680	7504040	Skypline at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. Loki.
7504040	7507240	So of course, since Battle Royale has to come to all the things,
7507960	7511640	what thing's going to get Battle Royale next? Well, it's going to be Doom.
7511640	7514840	And I'm not talking about new Doom. I'm talking about old Doom, classic Doom.
7515640	7523000	The Doom you remember as a child called Doom Royale with Cheese. And it's a mod that'll let
7523800	7530120	64 players fight to the death using the double-barreled shotgun.
7530120	7533240	And of course, just like PUBG and Fortnite, there's the shrinking
7535400	7541240	play field. They have ammo weapon scavenging. And of course, you have to be the last man standing.
7541240	7546760	So neat. You can find that over at ModDB if you're interested in checking it out.
7548760	7550840	It sounds kind of awesome, though. It's neat.
7550840	7553720	Yeah. No, I play Doom Battle Royale. It sounds like fun.
7553720	7559160	Yeah. Yeah. All right. And last but not least tonight, before we open up the Skypline,
7559160	7562920	let's talk about, you know, since all these classic systems are happening,
7562920	7567160	you know, somebody on the internet had to say CDI classic when.
7567880	7575320	So, oh, no, no. So somebody made a Photoshop user. I don't know if this guy actually made it,
7575320	7579160	but he made the tweet. Skully1888 tweeted at Philips with,
7579160	7583720	Philips CDI classics, 20 classic games, including Hotel Mario,
7583720	7588280	Zelda, The Wand of Gamelon, Link, The Faces of Evil, The Seventh Guest,
7588280	7593960	Playboy's Complete Massage, and Mad Dog McCree, as well as Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia.
7594760	7599160	Okay. Like out of that list, The Seventh Guest is probably the only notable game.
7599880	7600840	It's not very notable.
7600840	7604360	Mad Dog McCree, I know they released a ton of times, but it's not very good.
7604360	7607160	Seventh Guest they've re-released several times. Not very good.
7607160	7610680	It didn't age well. That's a problem. Anyway, here's the crazy part.
7610680	7615560	Philips replied saying, thank you very much for reminding us of the Philips CDI.
7615560	7619320	We appreciate the thought of a smaller classic version of one of our legacy devices.
7619880	7623000	And then somebody was like, you would make the buzz if you did it.
7623000	7624920	And Philips responded, thank you for your love.
7624920	7628200	And there's such a positive fucking person working in this Twitter account.
7629240	7631560	Hi, thank you for your love, encouragement, and interest.
7631560	7635400	We will try our best to fulfill your dreams and release something you suggest,
7635400	7639400	but cannot promise anything yet. Please be patient and stay tuned.
7639400	7640680	Thank you in advance.
7640680	7644360	Okay. This isn't going to fucking happen. Like, I don't know where,
7645000	7648280	I don't know where this joke, first off those Nintendo licenses,
7648280	7651800	Nintendo would rather you stop talking about those games.
7651880	7656600	Nintendo would really rather you stop talking about Hotel Mario and Zelda the Wand again.
7656600	7660920	They'll put Balzette in Smash before they put this out.
7660920	7662680	I mean, this is never going to fucking happen.
7664600	7669160	Now that's not to say that Philips couldn't still put something out with the Seventh Guest
7669160	7674200	and Mad Dog McCree, but like, I mean, if you don't think the PlayStation
7674760	7680360	classic lineup sounds very good so far, the Philips CDI lineup, not going to be good.
7680920	7686360	Now, I guess they could always do maybe like homebrew or something.
7686360	7690600	I don't know, but I just, I just, just let it go.
7690600	7691720	No, let it go.
7691720	7692440	Please don't.
7692440	7699560	The Philips CDI is best left as that, that thing that some guy has at a booth at a classic gaming
7699560	7705560	expo that you look at and you pick it up and you play Zelda Wanda Gamelon for five minutes ago.
7705560	7706200	What the fuck?
7706200	7708920	Wow. This really was a shit game.
7710360	7712200	And then you go on with the rest of your day.
7712200	7717080	So now that we've gotten these two consoles out of the way, uh, anybody hitting up, uh,
7717080	7721960	Panasonic for the 3DO Mini or the, or Sega for the Saturn Mini?
7721960	7723320	Where's my Jaguar Mini?
7724520	7727880	Let's play Aliens First Predator and Tempest 2000.
7727880	7729240	You want your Jaguar Mini?
7729240	7729400	Yeah.
7729400	7730040	It's coming out.
7730040	7732440	It's called the fucking new Atari system that they have.
7733720	7735320	That's your Jaguar Mini right there.
7736840	7737340	All right.
7738120	7739320	We're going to open up the Skypline.
7739320	7739880	It's that time.
7739880	7741960	So Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7741960	7745080	If you want to give us a call about something we've talked about so far, or maybe something
7745080	7748120	we haven't, but, um, I know there's a lot of news stories we didn't get to.
7748120	7748840	Yes.
7748840	7750920	This is important news that we have to get to.
7750920	7751080	Okay.
7751080	7752760	So tell me some of the stuff we missed here.
7752760	7754440	Just talking about Assassin's Creed.
7754440	7758040	And of course in Assassin's Creed, there is a giant statue of Zeus.
7758840	7761240	And what can you do with this giant statue of Zeus?
7761240	7764680	You can climb on its penis because it's Assassin's Creed.
7764680	7767080	And of course you can do that shit.
7767080	7767720	So why not?
7769400	7770600	It's very important news.
7771480	7773240	Can I put a pizza roll on his penis?
7774120	7774840	No, you may not.
7775560	7776120	Why not?
7777400	7781960	Sony is ending support for certain online games, including Warhawk, Twisted Metal,
7781960	7783880	PlayStation All-Stars, Battle Royale.
7783880	7787960	That's going to be ending on October 25th, 2018.
7787960	7789560	I'm surprised they hadn't already pulled the plug.
7789560	7794360	And Drawn to Death, David Jaffe's game is going to be out.
7794360	7797960	That came out a long time ago as one of the PlayStation plus titles, and it's going to
7797960	7799800	be ending March 25th, 2019.
7800760	7803000	So play it while you can.
7803000	7804520	I think it's free to play.
7804520	7809000	Yeah, it was free to play on PlayStation Plus, but I think they still charge 20 bucks for
7809000	7809080	it.
7809080	7812520	Speaking of PlayStation Plus, for October, we're going to be getting Friday the 13th
7812520	7814680	and Laser League, which Laser League is just like Tron.
7814680	7815560	So check it out.
7816360	7819960	PlayStation 3 is getting Master Reboot and The Bridge, which is cross by PlayStation
7819960	7821240	4 and Vita.
7821240	7825800	PlayStation Vita is cross by PlayStation 4, RocketBirds 2 Evolution and 2064 Read Only
7825800	7826280	Memories.
7826280	7827320	So that's pretty awesome.
7827320	7827880	Neat.
7828200	7833720	Um, on the Xbox front, Games of Gold, you're going to be getting Overcooked for the month
7833720	7838200	of October and Victor Vran from the middle of October to the 15th.
7838200	7838520	All right.
7838520	7840760	Let's get to the phones real quick and then we'll get back to Loki.
7840760	7841880	Hi, you're on Orange Mountain Radio.
7841880	7842760	Who's this?
7842760	7843720	Hey, this is Def.
7843720	7844680	Hey Def, how you doing?
7846360	7849800	Well, I have a Pokemon Go story that happened today.
7849800	7851160	I love Pokemon Go stories.
7851160	7853800	Is this about the day that you hit BFF status with me?
7853800	7855000	Because I'm sure it was a great day.
7856040	7856920	No, it was a great day.
7856920	7859080	But no, I'm talking about specifically today.
7860520	7867400	And it's something that we sometimes joke about in the whole community that when bad
7867400	7872680	weather's in the city, you probably shouldn't go out and play.
7874200	7882120	Well, there's a tropical storm happening right now in my city, but right now it's like really
7882120	7885560	calm that it was cloudy earlier and all.
7886760	7892280	But we had a Mewtwo raid near my house, so I decided to go.
7893240	7899480	I didn't notice until I was out and I was heading my way to that raid that we had a
7899480	7900040	thunderstorm.
7901240	7905320	I didn't pay that much attention and I said, oh, that seems like it's far away.
7906840	7908040	Nothing bad will happen.
7908040	7912120	You did the same thing we always do with the alert that comes up in Pokemon Go.
7912120	7913160	There's a severe weather.
7913160	7913800	Yeah, who cares?
7913800	7916200	Click or just like I'm a passenger.
7916200	7916840	Yeah, sure I am.
7917480	7925400	Here's the thing that the weather in Pokemon Go at the moment was sunny because because
7925400	7926360	of course it was.
7927560	7928360	It always is.
7928360	7929000	And we had that.
7929000	7931160	We had it the other day, too, is like weather warning.
7931160	7932840	It's like weather warning.
7932840	7934120	There's clouds in the sky.
7934120	7935480	I don't even know what that warning was for.
7935480	7937240	Maybe a fire is a fire alert or something.
7937320	7937720	Maybe.
7937720	7938120	I don't know.
7938120	7938520	Who knows?
7938520	7941400	I want to know the rest of the story because it sounds like danger is involved.
7941960	7946200	Yeah, but yeah, it actually looks like like partially cloudy.
7946200	7950440	But yeah, it was really cloudy and thunder was happening happening.
7951000	7955720	And we I happened to to get there to the raid and people were waiting.
7956360	7963640	And and yeah, the thunder was still coming out, but it was like far.
7964280	7964920	OK.
7964920	7968920	When suddenly we were going to we're we're preparing for the raid and all.
7969560	7972680	And suddenly we heard like a boom.
7974520	7983000	And yeah, there was a big flash there and and I just like I was I started like, well,
7983000	7983640	it happened here.
7983640	7984200	It happened here.
7984200	7986360	It happened near near near us.
7986360	7987960	And I was kind of panicking.
7988760	7996920	And then I noticed that like 15 meters, like, I don't know, the conversion by 20 feet, maybe
7996920	8002520	they'll know that a tree that was near was destroyed.
8003480	8004440	Oh, my God.
8004440	8009400	So you went out to catch a Mewtwo and a tree right next to you got hit by lightning.
8010280	8010920	Basically.
8010920	8015480	And but people there were more people there that were way near.
8016360	8017320	But act out.
8017320	8018440	Did you catch the Mewtwo?
8020280	8024360	Sadly, sadly, because people were panicked.
8024360	8026040	They were panicking.
8026040	8028920	We only had like a few people there.
8028920	8034440	And we had like two groups and my group didn't finish the raid.
8035720	8037160	We couldn't catch it.
8038680	8039480	He did all that.
8039480	8041640	You almost got killed by lightning and they didn't.
8041640	8043240	You couldn't even catch the damn Mewtwo.
8044040	8046600	But that's that's the least of my worries.
8048040	8050280	No, you know, I had to make fun of made fun of it somehow.
8050280	8052600	But that's that's crazy that it was like so.
8052600	8053160	Oh, my God.
8053160	8054040	Like, that's scary.
8054040	8057400	I thought this was going to be that like lightning hit the pokey stop and lightning
8057400	8061560	destroyed the pokey stop when pokey stops are so rare in Mexico to begin with.
8061560	8068120	Yeah, the pokey stop, the little the little thing was next to that tree.
8068120	8072680	So, yeah, good thing it didn't start a fire and burned down the pokes.
8072680	8073720	I shouldn't make fun of it.
8073720	8075160	Could you use Thunderbolt?
8075160	8076200	It was very effective.
8078360	8085000	Loki, people caught Mewtwo in that raid with with thunder, with the thunder attack.
8085720	8090040	So, yeah, you should you should remember that for next time to yell that out.
8090040	8091240	Pikachu used Thunderbolt.
8091240	8092280	It's super effective.
8092280	8093080	That's that's good.
8093080	8093960	I like that, Loki.
8095400	8099560	Oh, but everyone was fine.
8100200	8102120	Uh, someone did that.
8102120	8106040	They'd get hit by the tree, but nothing too serious.
8106040	8108520	Just like a scrap or something.
8108520	8109020	Oh, my God.
8109720	8110600	Sudowoodo.
8110600	8111640	No, I'm just kidding.
8111640	8111880	I'm sorry.
8111880	8112520	I can't help it.
8113880	8116680	No, we're all in the community locally here.
8116680	8118360	We're joking about it and all.
8118360	8124280	And again, it was like it was a complete like terrifying.
8124280	8129160	But at the at the same moment, like really exciting moment, because, oh, my God, it
8129240	8129560	happened.
8129560	8130120	That happened.
8130840	8131720	So, you know what?
8131720	8135000	And danger is fun to flirt with once in a while.
8135000	8138520	That was that was like thrill seeking Pokemon adventures.
8138520	8140360	Soon you're going to be the star of a documentary.
8140360	8143560	But instead of like storm chasers, it's going to be Mewtwo chasers.
8145240	8146360	Pokemon raid chasers.
8146360	8147240	Yeah, chasers.
8147240	8147800	Oh, my God.
8147800	8149000	I'm screaming.
8149000	8153800	Well, I know we're only sitting here making jokes because you're OK and everybody else
8153800	8155800	is OK, except whoever got hit by the tree.
8155800	8157720	But it sounds like it was a little more superficial.
8157720	8159560	Like it wasn't a big branch or something.
8159560	8159800	Right.
8159800	8160520	Sounds like they're OK.
8161240	8161480	Yeah.
8162040	8165240	Everybody got the they're fine.
8165240	8166040	Nobody got hurt.
8166040	8172360	So I'm really glad about that, because if someone had gotten hurt or even gotten hit
8172360	8177080	by the lightning, it would have been like like really terrifying.
8177080	8179080	Like and again, it was terrifying.
8179080	8182520	But since nothing happened, basically.
8183080	8183880	Yeah, we're laughing.
8183880	8186040	And yeah, the tree and all that stuff.
8186040	8187960	But yeah, it's something serious that happened.
8188600	8194600	I don't know what I would have done like seriously, because it was like at that moment.
8194600	8200920	And I still have the image basically ingrained in my in my head, in my mind right now of
8200920	8202040	the flash.
8202040	8206200	I literally saw that flash, the lightning flash that that hit the tree.
8206920	8209160	And it was really like something.
8209960	8213400	You know, it also goes to show that those warnings that they put at the beginning of
8213480	8214600	the game, like they're no joke.
8214600	8216040	Like you have to really pay attention.
8216040	8220600	And, you know, I hate to be a downer, but I think it's it's worth saying, like, you
8220600	8223720	know, I know in the Ingress community, like there was a player in Europe who actually
8223720	8228760	died because they were not paying attention and they essentially walked off a cliff.
8228760	8231400	Like and I know that sounds ridiculous as I'm saying it out loud and you're probably
8231400	8231880	going like what?
8231880	8233800	But like, you know, they just weren't paid.
8233800	8234600	I think it was at night.
8234600	8236120	So it's kind of dangerous as well.
8236120	8238280	And they were, you know, trying to take down a big field or something.
8238280	8238600	I don't know.
8238600	8239960	They basically like fell off a cliff.
8239960	8241720	I think it was like wet outside or something.
8241720	8245560	So like, you know, they're luckily active is OK and everybody's OK.
8245560	8247640	So we can we can poke fun and laugh at it.
8247640	8250280	But there is a very serious, you know, note here.
8250280	8252600	And that is like, you know, those warnings do exist for a reason.
8252600	8256200	You do want to be aware when you're playing these games, because even though we're talking
8256200	8259480	about like natural weather and these, you know, freak things like you don't want to,
8259480	8263480	like, get hit by a car because you cross the street, you know, that type of thing like
8263480	8264920	that is serious as well, you know?
8264920	8272200	Yeah, that this basically made me right about the game and and how I should approach it,
8272200	8278120	because again, like at the beginning of the story, like I said, I was like and nothing
8278120	8278840	bad will happen.
8279560	8281960	And literally that happened like, whoa.
8281960	8288840	And so, yeah, the story is basically just for people that play like Ingress, Pokemon
8288840	8291320	Go, all this kind of games.
8291320	8292280	Just be careful out there.
8292520	8298600	It we can sometimes think that nothing bad will happen and then it happens.
8298600	8301000	So so basically that just stay aware.
8301000	8301640	For sure.
8301640	8302200	For sure.
8302200	8306440	And Act F for next time, make sure you train a Golem and get them on your team because
8306440	8308520	the Golem will absorb the Thunderbolt for next time.
8309560	8310120	I will.
8310120	8310680	All right.
8310680	8311400	Thank you for the call.
8311400	8312520	Act F and happy hunting.
8312520	8313020	Take care.
8313480	8314360	Hey, thanks for having me.
8314360	8314840	Yeah, no problem.
8314840	8315480	Thanks for the story.
8315480	8316040	It was really good.
8316040	8316540	Bye.
8317160	8317660	Wow.
8318120	8318360	Yeah.
8318360	8318840	Oh my gosh.
8318840	8319320	I can't imagine.
8319320	8320120	Oh, I've never.
8320120	8322040	Have you ever had lightning hit that close to you?
8322040	8324440	Like I've never had the storms up.
8324440	8328120	Well, also we don't like get tropical storms here in the Sacramento, you know, Northern
8328120	8328760	California.
8328760	8332040	We have a very unique kind of weather pattern because we don't really get those same type
8332040	8332600	of things.
8332600	8336280	I think we're supposed to be getting rain finally on like Tuesday or Wednesday in the
8336280	8338120	distance, maybe even tonight.
8338120	8343000	I wonder if it's the remnants of this trouble because, you know, Act F is, I believe in
8343000	8348040	Mexicali, if I remember right, which is kind of like it's it's basically south of California,
8348040	8350200	but it's not like Tijuana is way on the west.
8350200	8353640	It's a little more eastern than that, you know, and it's kind of south.
8353640	8357400	So, um, I wonder if the storm is big enough where we're getting like remnants of it
8357400	8357960	up here.
8357960	8358460	Maybe.
8359080	8359320	Yeah.
8359320	8361640	Well, be careful if there's thunder attached to that.
8361640	8363640	Sounds, uh, it sounds like it could be dangerous.
8363640	8364040	Anyway.
8364040	8367320	Um, you were talking about, uh, the PlayStation games.
8367320	8367640	Yeah.
8367640	8369560	For, uh, PlayStation plus.
8369560	8369880	Yes.
8369880	8370600	Orange launch radio.
8370600	8371400	All one word on Skype.
8371400	8371800	If you want to get.
8371800	8376840	So Xbox, um, I mentioned Overcooked and Victor Brown and then on the Xbox 360 compatible
8376920	8381240	games, Stuntman Ignition and Hitman Blood Money will be October's games.
8382120	8387960	Um, Nintendo has won a lawsuit against some Tokyo company that runs a service called,
8387960	8395080	um, Maricar, which is, uh, basically tours through Tokyo in go-karts dressed up like
8395080	8397720	Mario Kart characters, which sounds awesome.
8397720	8403240	And, uh, so they are going to stop doing that because they, you know, filed, um, are fine
8403240	8404120	against them.
8404120	8406360	But to get your Mario Kart experience.
8406360	8411240	So the Nam Bandai Man Namco is going to be bringing over Mario Kart VR to the U S pretty
8411240	8411560	soon.
8411560	8412120	Oh, cool.
8412120	8414040	I'm starting in Washington, DC.
8414040	8416840	It's coming to their VR zone.
8416840	8418760	Um, it's like an arcade thing.
8418760	8419240	Yes.
8419240	8420440	Have you ever been down to that?
8420440	8423880	Um, I always want to call it punch trunk, but this is punch bowl social.
8423880	8426200	Have you been to that place that it's by the new arena?
8426200	8431720	So they have like these VR things cause you can, you can, um, uh, rent the VR headset.
8431720	8433880	It's like right next to these other arcade games.
8434520	8436040	The arcade isn't super impressive.
8436040	8438600	It's like a couple of skee-ball machines, a couple of pinball machines and some classics.
8438600	8441320	But I think it's interesting to have the VR arcade right next to that.
8441320	8444360	And it looks like you can rent the headset for a little while and you, you can play that
8444360	8444920	one.
8444920	8445960	Bobby will know what I'm talking about.
8445960	8449640	What's the, what's the music game with the blue and the orange shields that you hold
8449640	8452760	up to absorb that, that that's one of the games.
8452760	8454120	Not beat saver.
8454120	8455480	No, it's not beat saver.
8455480	8458600	It's kind of pre-dates that is earlier than that.
8459320	8461000	I think beat saver would be more exciting.
8461000	8461640	Audio shield.
8461640	8461960	That's it.
8461960	8462440	Thank you, Bobby.
8462440	8463240	I knew you'd know it.
8463240	8465480	So audio shields, the one that they're playing on that.
8465480	8470200	I, this Mario Kart VR though, if you watch people playing that, I bet there'd be tons
8470200	8471240	of people lined up for that.
8471240	8471880	Yeah.
8471880	8472840	Heck yeah.
8472840	8473340	That's cool.
8474600	8479720	Um, and then of course there's news saying that there's gonna be a new track coming to
8479720	8480840	kingdom hearts three.
8480840	8485160	It's a collaboration between Skrillex and Hikaru Tada.
8485800	8486360	Sorry.
8486360	8487000	Jumping in real quick.
8487000	8489720	Cause I think this is a good comment in our chat at live.fognetwork.com.
8489800	8493240	Bob coffee says, I'm willing to bet Nintendo shut them down because Mario Kart is going
8493240	8495960	to be one of the rides and Nintendo land at universal.
8495960	8500760	Well, it was that in that they were hitting, they were accidentally crashing into pedestrians
8500760	8501480	and stuff like that.
8501480	8504600	And so it was kind of making a bad name for a marker.
8504600	8505880	That would be a way to end your day.
8506760	8507000	Anyway.
8507000	8507960	Sorry to interrupt you, Loki.
8508760	8513480	Um, and then, yeah, so there was going to be a new track coming called face my fears,
8513480	8518120	um, which is going to be sometime soon that they're going to debut that.
8518760	8519080	All right.
8519080	8520920	Let's go to the Skype line and take another call.
8520920	8521080	Hi.
8521080	8521960	You're on orange launch radio.
8521960	8522360	Who's this?
8523080	8526600	Hey, uh, uh, uh, uh, this is raging leader.
8526600	8526920	Yes.
8526920	8527640	What's up raging air.
8527640	8528200	What's in your mind?
8528760	8530040	Uh, not too much.
8530040	8535400	Uh, two things, uh, to touch on, uh, the whole files, that thing that you were talking about
8535400	8535960	earlier.
8535960	8536840	Fuck my life.
8536840	8537080	Yeah.
8538120	8538440	All right.
8539080	8545240	As much as I would love to agree with you 100%, I'll do so unofficially.
8546200	8550120	Uh, it's already tired and old and overdone.
8550120	8556520	It wasn't even funny to begin with, but there is a little bit of a hiccup.
8557240	8567800	Um, looks like my significant other is jumping on board, uh, board, uh, you know, uh, train
8567800	8569000	to stop.
8569880	8570600	Yeah.
8570600	8577400	So officially I have to support her and her decision to do it.
8577400	8583960	So you don't have to, well, you can say that you have moral and religious objections now.
8583960	8588680	Now I feel it's very important to support our significant others, especially when it
8588680	8591960	has to do with dressing up like scantily clad video game characters.
8591960	8594040	So I am all for this.
8595240	8595640	Yeah.
8595640	8601640	Well, I was going to say, well, there is that aspect, but if I ever want her to lay a single
8601640	8605080	finger on me, I'm going to support her.
8605080	8608920	100%, uh, therefore it's the greatest thing in the world.
8609560	8612040	Um, so, ew.
8612040	8614920	But, uh, I'm sorry.
8614920	8615320	Ew.
8615320	8617640	I didn't, anyway, yes.
8617640	8617880	Okay.
8617880	8621480	So is this just about Bowsette and your lady friend or is there, is there something else
8621480	8622120	here?
8622120	8627320	Well, you know, there, um, uh, there's a second thing, but, uh, I want to lead off.
8627320	8627560	Yeah.
8627560	8628120	Second thing.
8628120	8628600	Let's do it.
8629240	8636280	Oh, well, I can't remember if I brought this up the last time I called you short or not,
8636280	8640680	but just in case I didn't, um, Lily is a gamer.
8640680	8641240	You brought it up.
8642040	8649240	Oh, well, um, uh, one thing I would like to ask is, do you know of any co-op games that,
8649240	8654920	uh, we could play that's on PC that cancel, you know, towards horror?
8656120	8659480	Uh, you, you kind of did ask about the horror thing, but no, you didn't ask about co-op,
8659480	8663800	I guess the co-op horror game that's, uh, co-op get, get that PlayStation plus, uh,
8663800	8664680	Friday the 13th.
8665400	8666840	Well, yeah, there's that.
8666840	8672040	And then there's also, it's not really a horror game per se, but, uh, don't starve is kind
8672040	8676600	of got that, you know, it's got a little bit of like Adam's family macabre vibe.
8676600	8677640	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
8677640	8679880	Yeah, she does have don't starve together.
8679880	8685480	And in fact, uh, we were playing dad, uh, probably within the past week or so.
8686200	8689800	Uh, you know, you know, it, it's a decent game.
8689800	8692280	Unfortunately, I suck at it.
8692280	8697880	What's the one everybody is fucking playing with the, the different roster of serial killers
8697880	8700360	and like everybody's streaming it on Twitch dead, dead by daylight.
8700360	8701000	Is that what it's called?
8701720	8702840	Is that what I'm thinking of me?
8702840	8703960	That sounds familiar.
8703960	8705480	I think that's the one I'm thinking of.
8705480	8709720	Um, where like you can play as like the shape from Halloween and Laurie Strode and all this
8709720	8710360	shit.
8710360	8713160	And like, it's, it's, it's like a four V one thing.
8714040	8716200	It's a similar formula to the Friday the 13th.
8716200	8717240	That sounds cool.
8717240	8718120	I didn't know what that was.
8718120	8718280	No.
8718280	8718520	Yeah.
8718520	8719320	It's, Oh God.
8719320	8720920	It's, it's all over Twitch.
8720920	8721160	Yeah.
8721160	8721800	Dead by daylight.
8721800	8721960	Thank you.
8721960	8722520	Sue Deberry.
8722520	8723240	I thought that's what it was.
8724520	8725240	Oh, all right.
8725240	8725480	Yeah.
8725480	8726920	I'll definitely look into that.
8726920	8730760	Um, now I want to help her build up her, uh, steam library.
8730760	8736360	Her steam library is a little smaller compared to mine, which is kind of a no dust.
8736360	8737320	It's not the size.
8737320	8738280	It's how you use it.
8739080	8739320	Yeah.
8739880	8745240	Um, yeah, the only thing she, you know, she, uh, Syphon, uh, don't stop together.
8745240	8750120	The only thing she, uh, he has that's co-op is portal two and she hasn't touched that
8750120	8750680	forever.
8750680	8754840	So, uh, but it's not exactly a scary game either, but it's fun.
8754840	8755080	Yes.
8756040	8756520	Yeah.
8756520	8756840	Yeah.
8756840	8757800	No doubt about it.
8757800	8758600	It is fun.
8758920	8764040	But, uh, you know, since she's really having to the horror games now, I'll definitely look
8764040	8764760	into that.
8764760	8766520	Rage Nader, I'm going to tell you what not to do.
8767240	8770600	Don't get Mario party because that will end in divorce.
8772040	8776680	Well, we're, you know, we have to get married first and besides she doesn't have any consoles
8776680	8778360	anyways, just PC only.
8778360	8779880	So it is just a joke.
8779880	8780200	All right.
8781560	8783240	Tons of cool characters in there.
8783240	8783880	Yeah.
8783880	8784280	All right.
8784280	8785720	Uh, Rage Nader, I'm going to let you go.
8785720	8786760	So, uh, take care.
8786760	8787000	Okay.
8787640	8787880	All right.
8787880	8788440	Have a good one.
8788440	8788680	All right.
8788680	8789240	Bye.
8789240	8791800	Like Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Leatherface.
8792360	8792600	Yeah.
8792600	8795640	They've got, well, it's a saw, but it jigsaw.
8796440	8801320	Um, I don't know who some of these, I think they just made up.
8801880	8804520	Yeah, they probably made some up and then the game was so good.
8804520	8807160	It got a bunch of like license stuff and so forth.
8807160	8808120	So pretty cool.
8808120	8808360	All right.
8808360	8810360	Orange launch radio, all one word on Skype.
8810360	8813000	Just a few more minutes to get in while Loki recaps other stuff.
8813000	8815160	One more piece of news that's pretty important.
8815880	8819560	A very popular online game is getting a brand new expansion.
8819560	8821080	It's 25th expansion.
8821080	8827160	That is EverQuest is getting a brand new expansion called the Burning Lands.
8829320	8830680	And I thought that was pretty notable.
8830680	8835880	So, you know, it's going to have new monsters, new zones, items, raids, and more.
8836680	8844840	So yeah, time to fire up your EverQuest online account.
8844840	8845640	Or don't.
8845640	8847320	I mean, the choice is yours.
8849320	8850600	You can also not do that.
8853320	8857160	No, I get, I get, look, I get, I've been such a bitch, but I'm sure there's people
8857160	8859960	that play EverQuest out there that really enjoy it.
8859960	8860360	And that's cool.
8860360	8862920	Like if you invest all the time, it's like World of Warcraft.
8862920	8865400	I'm kind of like World of Warcraft is kind of old at this point.
8865400	8868440	It's showing its age, but like some people have invested so much time and stuff into
8868440	8870040	that, like they don't really want to let it go.
8870040	8874520	And I have to have a giant enemy snail because that is one of the new enemies.
8875480	8877400	There are snails in World of Warcraft.
8877400	8880280	World of Warcraft has those adorable llamas in the new expansion though.
8880280	8881240	They're really cute.
8881240	8882920	So it does have that.
8882920	8884520	But do the llamas have crossbows?
8885480	8886760	Not yet, but maybe they'll work on that.
8886760	8888280	The Pandarians have crossbows.
8889880	8891000	No, no, I don't know.
8891960	8892460	All right.
8893960	8895640	Anyway, I guess it's going to do it.
8895640	8898840	We're not getting any other calls and I think Loki has ran through his last minute news.
8898840	8901560	So I think that is where we wrap up for the night.
8901560	8904360	But I want to thank you guys for tuning into our show and listening and participating
8904360	8905160	with us tonight.
8905160	8908360	If you didn't get through on Skype, but you want to still send us a shout, you can always
8908360	8912040	just participate at orangelaundradio.com, our email, or you can always tweet at us at
8912040	8912680	OLR.
8912680	8917320	We're also on Facebook at facebook.com orangelaundradio, even if we're not posting on there.
8917320	8920840	I always every day I log into Facebook, it goes, you haven't engaged with your people
8920840	8921560	with orange laundry.
8921560	8922680	I'm like, I don't know what to say.
8922680	8924680	I guess I need to post more funny memes.
8924680	8928200	I need to steal content from other places because that's what people do on Facebook.
8928200	8929320	Is that what y'all want me to do?
8929320	8933480	I don't think anyone sees anything on Facebook because that shit gets buried underneath
8933480	8934680	advertisements and crap.
8934680	8935320	That's true.
8935320	8936200	That's true.
8936200	8936700	All right.
8937320	8940360	So I guess that's going to do it for another episode of the show.
8940360	8946360	So let's go around and oh, before I get to final thoughts, I will say, as ever and always,
8946360	8950440	if you enjoy what you heard here at orange launch radio, please give us a five star review
8950440	8952680	on iTunes or Google play.
8952680	8956360	Cause those nice reviews go a very long way in helping spread the word about the show.
8956360	8960360	But you know what's even better telling a friend or two or five about the show, help
8960360	8962760	us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
8962840	8964600	But the voices aren't here to air.
8966680	8969080	It's going to be the same phone call every week.
8969080	8969580	Just kidding.
8970280	8973320	So anyway, I think that's it.
8973320	8975560	So I guess it's final thought time.
8975560	8978600	So my final thought tonight is I'm going to stream after the show.
8979240	8982840	I did a poll on my Twitter over at mr Rob Roberts.
8982840	8987240	And I think when I last checked classic NES stuff was winning for what we're going to
8987240	8987880	stream tonight.
8989560	8991240	Yeah, that's the winners classic NES stuff.
8991240	8993160	So that's what we're going to do tonight after the show.
8993160	8997640	So over at my Twitch channel, Rob Roberts, Loki, your final thought tonight.
8997640	9000920	I was hoping to work on more game development stuff this week.
9000920	9006760	I've been really tired after doing a lot of exercising and crap and just, just haven't
9006760	9011240	had the intelligence to do it at late at night and just kind of sit down and watch TV.
9011240	9014280	So I got through maniac finally, which is pretty awesome on Netflix.
9014280	9018520	And also I recommend if you haven't checked it out yet, American Vandal is hilarious,
9018520	9019560	especially season two.
9020280	9026280	Um, it's, it's a funny mockumentary type thing talking about like these like school,
9027640	9029160	like pranksters and stuff.
9029160	9031000	And it's, it's really funny to watch.
9031560	9032600	It's, it's fun.
9033560	9034040	All right.
9034040	9035160	And maniacs pretty good too.
9036120	9036600	All right.
9036600	9038280	Well, we'll see you in seven days.
9038280	9039320	We'll do this all over again.
9039320	9041800	Our buddy Delvin from video game realness also going to be here next week.
9041800	9043880	So it's going to be a very, uh, screamy loud show.
9043880	9047800	It should be fun because Delvin and I, when we get around each other, so Loki will be
9047800	9051560	having a good, maybe our screams will, um, he's a big Nintendo fan too.
9051560	9053560	So that'd be really fun to have you guys in the same room.
9053560	9054200	So all right.
9054200	9056440	Yeah, it's on next week.
9056440	9057480	No, we're going to have a great show.
9057480	9061080	I look forward to, uh, you can't do anything dumb this week.
9062520	9064440	I mean, you're releasing super Mario party.
9064440	9067160	So I guess that's not entirely bad unless it's fucked up.
9067160	9068920	And then in which case you'll hear.
9068920	9069800	All right, we're out.
9069800	9071880	We'll see what happens in seven days when we see you next time.
9071880	9074280	Thank you guys so much for listening to and supporting orange launch radio.
