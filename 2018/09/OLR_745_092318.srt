Episode number 745 of our show

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My name's Rob Roberts joining you live here from our headquarters in Sacramento, California

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
with my co-host as he's been every week here lately

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hello

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hi Loki, how are you doing?

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm good

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So no food tonight, this diet thing you've been on is like a serious thing

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's not that, I mean

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well I see you have like a protein shake, you're doing the same thing my husband does

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No, it's just I ate lunch late, I cooked, I had some chicken I bought last week so I had to cook it before it went bad

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And so I ate that for lunch at like 2.33 so I mean

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's kind of too early to eat again and I thought well I can have like a taco or something like that

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But it was a chicken taco, I'm like I just ate chicken, I don't really want to eat that again

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So I don't know

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The last few days I've been trying to come in under a thousand calories under my already 500 calorie

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Under my limit of what I'm supposed to eat

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Well just don't overdo it with some of those cutting corners

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Well like yesterday I ate a whole pizza so then I had to play DDR for 90 minutes straight

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So maybe it's like a weekly budget, I see how it goes

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
No no no, that was just a slip but no

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Lately it's been, because I got a Fitbit for my birthday so I've been doing a lot more walking

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So I walk 3 miles a day, well during the week, not necessarily on the weekends because I don't have time for that

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The 3 miles during the day, I fast for 16 hours up until about 1pm

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So I don't eat until 1pm and then I go for a 3 mile walk and then I pick up lunch

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And I come back and then I come home after all that and then I play DDR for another 30 minutes or so

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So for those that, you know, I don't think we've talked about this in quite a while but

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Loki's really like slimmed down, I know it's a radio show at least for now

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I mean we talked about how we're going to move to Twitch eventually but

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Because I bought new pants is why, because these pants actually fit and not the other ones

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The other ones are really baggy and like were too big

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You've really slimmed down though, you've really slimmed down

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I really haven't, I mean thank you but the scale says otherwise

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well since you started this whole thing, I don't mean like in the past week or two

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I mean since you started this whole thing, anyway

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We're keeping somebody waiting over there, unfortunately we've missed her these past few weeks

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But she's back to terrorize us once again, say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm overwhelmed by being back

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And all of the stuff that Ikuma sent us

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh yes, so right before the show, one of our pals from overseas, Akuma JP, shout out

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Sent a little care package

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
A little?

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It ended up being a big care package, so a big thank you to Akuma JP and all these little

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You can send him all the pumpkin spice things

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't know if pumpkin spice is as big as a thing, but you can get kapocha

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's what I could send him in return, I could say here's a little taste of America

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And just do like all the pumpkin spice garbage

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Send him the ultimate white girl fantasy?

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes, ultimate like now Akuma JP I know it's your fantasy to be a basic bitch, so here you go

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That was like that Cinderella meme, it was like at midnight your character turns back into a pumpkin

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes bitch

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That is me, here's the thing

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Here's the thing, it's not that like I'm obsessed with pumpkin spice

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I think I'm just the only one in the group of friends that's like willing to admit it

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Like fuck yes I'm excited pumpkin spice is in season

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Hell yes I'm gonna order a pumpkin spice latte

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You know why? Because pumpkin spice lattes are fucking good

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm gonna be making pumpkin bread

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And so I get teased for being that bitch

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm not making it sweet

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I like a lot of different food

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Anyway it's not the food podcast Dark Sakura

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes it is

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I actually

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I just ate filet mignon and it was great

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Want me to talk about meat and potatoes? The meat and potato show

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Have sweet potato, eat it

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I need to go to our social media because over on Twitter

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
At twitter.com slash olr

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I actually asked the listeners

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I gave Twitter a little love and I said

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
She's in the studio tonight on a brief reprieve from her work schedule

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Which of these recent headlines from the shows she's missed

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Should Rob ask her about right at the top of the show

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So you ready for what the listeners picked

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
For the video game topic that you've missed that we need to get into

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
With 87% of the vote

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What are your thoughts on the new Animal Crossing game for Nintendo Switch being announced

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It must happen, I need it

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And it has to be as great as New Leaf was

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And I have to be able to have

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Going to all the villages and changing their shit

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And planting stuff

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I want more black tulips

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And I want to be able to murder Tom Nook in his sleep

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
How about bug net violence

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I want to be able to kick people out of my village

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Banish people from the village

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I want to banish people from my village

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Do you want witch trials

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
No not that bad I just want to kick Ed out when he shows up

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You know I create backstories for all the characters in the game

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's not the Animal Crossing game that I want

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's Animal Crossing after dark that I really want

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I do want more villagers to be like night owls

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah I always hated when the villagers would go to bed

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Like at the time that I want to play the game

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I want there to be like 24 hour shopping

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That isn't just like the club

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Like club lol

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So did you watch that whole little thing with the Isabelle reveal

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And the new Animal Crossing

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Like that whole little thing on Nintendo Direct

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Did you watch the actual teaser

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I just cared that they said Animal Crossing

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And that apparently Isabelle is in Smash Brothers

118
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yes Isabelle is in Smash Brothers

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So the whole thing

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What are you going to do

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Beat people up with you know bills and park projects

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yes

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Well the villagers are in the game

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And the villagers are in the game

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So why not Isabelle

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It made a lot of sense

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But the whole set up was that it started with

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And people are supposed to be misled to think

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh it's an Animal Crossing reveal

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But in fact it was Isabelle is in Smash

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And that's how it started

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But then it fades to black

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And it fades back up

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And it's Tom Nook sitting at the computer

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Which has lent itself to so many wonderful memes

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
By the way those images of Tom Nook sitting at the computer

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And then he talks to the camera

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And reveals that Animal Crossing is under development

139
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
For next year for the Switch

140
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And that's where that came from

141
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So it's kind of like a back to back

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Better not be more fucking happy home designer

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Even though I love that game too

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It got old though

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Alright so there you go

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Jamie's thoughts on Animal Crossing

147
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
In a word, yes

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Where's my NES games

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What if we get SNES games that'd be rad

150
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Oh like in the

151
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Free stuff for Nintendo

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Those days are long gone

153
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I know

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It would be nice

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You have to pay a monthly or yearly fee

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
To be able to play those classic NES games

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That were free in the original Animal Crossing

158
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What if they had an arcade like in there

159
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And you like pay like a certain amount of like Nintendo points

160
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
To go into the arcade and play stuff

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I've always been about like how

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Don't they have a big enough development team at Nintendo

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That a couple people could just be assigned to making little mini games

164
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And they don't have to make it

165
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Just make NES style mini games

166
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And those would be what you would unlock

167
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And it would just be like

168
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Flappy Bird ripoffs

169
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And you know like

170
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Those types of things

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But like with the little villagers

172
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And you could like have high score competitions

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
With the villagers

174
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Or your friends that you invited to the village

175
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
There's the fishing competition

176
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And the tortomers island crap

177
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Okay alright that's true

178
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
They have some of those silly little things

179
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's true

180
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah

181
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So alright we'll see

182
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Going to our chat

183
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We do tape live of course every Sunday night

184
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
At the voice of geeks network

185
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Of vognetwork.com

186
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And if you are in our

187
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Or if you are listening live

188
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You should be in our chat room

189
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's over at live.vognetwork.com

190
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
All the info how to join our chat room

191
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Is right there

192
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Starting off SHG100 Matt saying

193
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I would watch Jamie stream Animal Crossing

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You gonna be doing any live streaming of

195
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh shit yeah

196
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay sounds good

197
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You know something else just occurred to me

198
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Because they let you do that in like

199
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
In the camp game

200
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Pocket camp

201
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You should be able to choose your skin tone

202
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
For your character

203
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Instead of like

204
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I mean you should still be able to like

205
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Tan if you go to the beach and everything

206
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Right

207
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But you should be able to like

208
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Choose your skin tone

209
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Instead of it being like

210
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Because I know that the intent is for

211
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Everyone to be Japanese

212
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I mean because

213
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But when it comes out in a diverse place

214
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
In a more diverse location

215
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It looks like default white

216
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You know

217
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Right right

218
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And I think that they should definitely

219
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Put in more

220
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Choices of skin tone that you can pick

221
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
From the start of the game

222
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Well I think Nintendo's been hearing

223
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Some of that feedback

224
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Because of what we're seeing

225
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
In the mobile game and stuff

226
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So I would anticipate that's gonna continue

227
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Into whatever you know

228
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
New Animal Crossing game comes out

229
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And all that

230
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So we'll see though

231
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Let's see

232
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Fifth Dream in chat says

233
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It better have big text

234
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So I can play it at work

235
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's a good call out

236
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Is that since it is going to be something

237
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That's designed to be portable

238
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And docked

239
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We will want to make sure

240
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That the text is readable

241
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
When we're sitting there

242
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Playing it in portable mode

243
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I want my amiibos to work

244
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm sure the

245
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh come on

246
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I want the villager amiibo

247
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
For Smash Brothers to work

248
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Amiibo support is probably like

249
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The first thing they thought about

250
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
In one of those meetings

251
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
How can we get more cash from our fans

252
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Did you see how many are still left over

253
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
At target in those places

254
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Because I think the bubble's bursting

255
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
A little bit on that

256
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I kind of think the amiibo pool

257
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Got too dilated

258
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Like they did not need to make

259
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I know you're not going to like this Jamie

260
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But they did not need to make figures

261
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
For like every character in Animal Crossing

262
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
They did not need to make figures

263
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
For all of Kirby's friends

264
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I need five different KK's

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So like that's the problem

266
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Is I think it just got too saturated

267
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Like the Smash Brothers series

268
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That was good

269
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But that should have been like

270
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That should have been the amiibo

271
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You know maybe a couple others

272
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Here and there like

273
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But I have my Mr. Resetti

274
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I know I know

275
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But it's just I just think it's

276
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's too much

277
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's too much

278
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And act up I agree

279
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
There's never enough Kirby amiibos

280
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
There's always going to be someone

281
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That disagrees with me

282
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Let's get to our kickoff topic

283
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Tonight officially

284
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Even though the losers here

285
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Twitch Prime changes 13% of the vote

286
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Steam TV 0% of the vote

287
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Jamie nobody cares about your opinion

288
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
On Steam TV apparently

289
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't care about Steam TV either

290
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Apparently Animal Crossing

291
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Is just too dominating there

292
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
People want to know

293
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
People associate you with that game

294
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I can't imagine why

295
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Alright anyway

296
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's talk about our official kickoff

297
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Topic tonight

298
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Let's get into

299
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Actually unfortunately

300
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This is kind of like shitty news

301
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And it's

302
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This is something that is inevitable

303
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
In the games industry

304
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And something we hear far too often about

305
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But I think in this particular stance

306
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Actually both

307
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
We're going to hear about two tonight

308
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Kind of a surprise I think

309
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Jamie why don't you start us off

310
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So we had a studio closure right

311
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And this was

312
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Kind of I don't know

313
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Feels like a surprise

314
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
To me

315
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's kind of a surprise

316
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But I also think it's karma

317
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Telltale is closing

318
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
They are starting by laying off

319
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Most of the employees

320
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Are leaving 25 there

321
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
To finish their obligations

322
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But they said that more information

323
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Is coming out in coming weeks

324
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
They also though apparently

325
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Haven't been paying severance packages

326
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
To their employees

327
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Not in this most recent round

328
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Well I'm sure that the management

329
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Is going to be paying themselves

330
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
A nice you know

331
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Chunk of money

332
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So fuck them

333
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Allegedly

334
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No likely

335
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Because that's all

336
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's capital

337
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
We don't know

338
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I have to say allegedly

339
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Because we don't know

340
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I just want to say

341
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
When you say

342
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Because

343
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
She's unhinged

344
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
She's back and she's unhinged

345
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Which is fine

346
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But when you say

347
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Karma

348
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I have hinges

349
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I think it's important to state

350
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You are targeting the management

351
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
In that

352
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And certainly

353
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
None of the hard working

354
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Story writers

355
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Programmers

356
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
People doing their jobs

357
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
My ire goes to the management

358
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Because it's their fucking fault

359
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah

360
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Their decisions

361
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
All I'll say

362
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Is it's a small world

363
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And

364
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
This comes from

365
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Things that we've heard

366
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And that's all we can say

367
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So to the management

368
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Of Telltale Games

369
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I want you to take

370
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
A wrought iron dildo

371
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Stop

372
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Just stop

373
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
They can also be used

374
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
As a metal file

375
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
For blacksmithing

376
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
They can be used

377
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
As a metal file

378
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
For blacksmithing

379
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And they like for you to sit on it

380
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And spin

381
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
In the opposite direction

382
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I just

383
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I

384
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I

385
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The anger comes from a place

386
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Of not only did they

387
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Kind of do their associates dirty

388
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
With this whole lack of severance

389
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And all this stuff

390
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But

391
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We've heard some accounts

392
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
On Twitter where

393
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
New employees left

394
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Their long careers

395
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
To start

396
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
On Monday

397
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And they were laid off

398
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
On Friday

399
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Like

400
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What kind of planning

401
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Is that?

402
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Like

403
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What kind of planning

404
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Is that?

405
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That's

406
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's

407
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's just a real

408
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's a real crappy way

409
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
To treat somebody too

410
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That would have left

411
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Like a long career

412
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
To come work

413
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
At this company

414
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Who's

415
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You know

416
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Making some good

417
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Good stuff

418
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You know

419
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Tons of people love

420
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The Walking Dead

421
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And again

422
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I want to stress

423
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The anger does not come

424
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
From a place

425
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Whatsoever

426
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
To the hardworking

427
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Frontline programmers

428
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Talented artists

429
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Story writers

430
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The management there

431
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Is garbage

432
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You can fertilize

433
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The shit

434
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is landfill

435
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The views and opinions

436
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Expressed by Jamie

437
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Are true

438
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I have to say

439
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That dildo smithing

440
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Is one skill tree

441
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That I didn't put

442
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
A lot of points in

443
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
In Skyrim

444
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But

445
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I may have to change

446
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
My mind on that

447
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Maybe next time

448
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah next time

449
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Next playthrough

450
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Let's see

451
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Go into chat

452
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
At live.vognetwork.com

453
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
As Joe and Hunter Matt

454
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Points out

455
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Those employees

456
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Live in the San Francisco

457
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Bay Area

458
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The highest cost

459
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Bay Area

460
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The North Bay Area

461
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Was where specifically

462
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
This office was located

463
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah

464
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
They were right near

465
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I used to work

466
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I keep wanting to say

467
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Martinez

468
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That's not it

469
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What's on the

470
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Just out of Marin

471
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
San

472
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Oh San

473
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
God damn it

474
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Why can't I think of the name

475
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
San Rafael

476
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
San Rafael

477
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That's it

478
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
San Rafael

479
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
San Quentin

480
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
No

481
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
across there

482
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
San Rafael

483
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's where they were located

484
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
If I remember right

485
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
When I was arrested

486
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I was dressed in black

487
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I was there too

488
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But um

489
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah Telltale

490
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Was right in that area

491
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And I'm telling you

492
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
North Bay Area

493
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Expensive

494
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Real estate

495
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Very expensive

496
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And Loki

497
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Fifth Dream says

498
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
This is a Skyrim mod

499
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Waiting to happen

500
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm sure it's a Skyrim mod

501
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Already happened

502
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But you know

503
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I haven't delved into all of those

504
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And Bones 006

505
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I said shit has uses

506
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You can fertilize with shit

507
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Garbage

508
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Dungeon Buster in chat says

509
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
That's BS planning

510
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Management had to know

511
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That things were going south

512
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And yet they let those

513
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Newcomers come in

514
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
There's no way their finance people

515
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Could not have already known

516
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Well before the hires were made

517
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And that's an example of

518
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Why there's anger about this

519
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And where that's coming from

520
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You know you want a concrete example

521
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Of how was the planning garbage

522
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
There's your answer

523
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But for what it's worth

524
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I know the studio did make some

525
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Pretty amazing games

526
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You know all things considered

527
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Certainly the Walking Dead series

528
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Known and appreciated by a lot of people

529
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
They made games based on Jurassic Park

530
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
They had the Sam and Max

531
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Was kind of the big comeback series games

532
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
They had those strong bad games

533
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That were on the Wii

534
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Back to the Future

535
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Back to the Future

536
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
They had the Batman

537
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The Marvel stuff

538
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Wolf Among Us

539
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So I mean there was all

540
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And I honestly thought

541
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You know they were in good financial places

542
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Because the types of games

543
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
They were putting out

544
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Were in my view

545
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Like long shelf life type of games

546
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Like you know in a lot of games

547
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Games have to sell

548
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Like all of their business

549
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's like right up front

550
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Like that's why pre-orders are so important

551
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's why launch day

552
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Stuff is so important

553
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Because so many games

554
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Make their sales

555
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Large percent of their sales

556
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The first week

557
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And I was always struck with

558
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That Telltale games didn't necessarily

559
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Have those same goals

560
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Because they would

561
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You know they had a long lifespan

562
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Something like the Walking Dead

563
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
People are just now

564
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Even getting into those games

565
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I know and I still have

566
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Like in my back catalog

567
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
In my PlayStation library

568
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I think on PlayStation 3

569
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I have like a ton of those series

570
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But now again

571
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
If you want to believe

572
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Everything you see on Twitter

573
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And social media

574
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So take it with a grain of salt

575
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But apparently

576
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Not all their games sold very well

577
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Apparently the Minecraft

578
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Story mode was doing very well

579
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That game was doing well

580
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But the Batman game

581
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Was one of their worst performing games period

582
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And that's kind of a stunning one

583
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
In a way

584
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't know though

585
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But in some way

586
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Like the DC movies

587
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Have not been very strong

588
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
We all know that

589
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That's because they're garbage

590
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
With garbage writing

591
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You're on a roll tonight

592
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The DC movies are not very strong

593
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I also kind of think

594
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Batman was saturated

595
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm not sure there was a place

596
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
For Telltale's very specific sort of

597
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Batman game in the mass market

598
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You know what there was a place for?

599
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Lego Batman

600
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And I think that's

601
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
People kind of associate

602
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The console gaming with like

603
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Lego Batman and that stuff

604
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I think the Batman Telltale thing

605
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Proved to be maybe too niche

606
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I don't know

607
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Apparently Tales from the Borderlands

608
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Also did not do well

609
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But like I hate to say it

610
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I kind of

611
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I mean that's a

612
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That was

613
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I don't even remember thinking this

614
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
When I first saw the game

615
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Like the game looked really good

616
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But I was like

617
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
This is a really niche thing

618
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Like I'm not going to want to play this

619
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
If I don't already have some familiarity

620
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
With Borderlands

621
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But I think the thinking that went into it

622
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Was the reverse

623
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Maybe we can bring more people

624
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Into Borderlands through this game

625
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
But I'm not sure that's how it really worked

626
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Whether the game was good or not

627
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm not saying it was a bad game

628
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Actually

629
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Considering I knew very little about Borderlands

630
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I actually enjoyed

631
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What Tales from the Borderlands I saw

632
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But I just think that

633
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You know kind of

634
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Limited the potential audience

635
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
But hindsight's

636
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
2020 right?

637
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So anyway

638
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It probably leads to why

639
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The games did not end up

640
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Performing as well as expected

641
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And why we're where we're at today

642
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Let's see

643
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Going to chat at

644
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Live.vognetware.com

645
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah Dungeon Buster says

646
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I thought the Batman games were doing really well

647
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So to read that rumor was eyebrow raising right?

648
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
But we don't

649
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
We don't really get game sales

650
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
In the same way we get box office

651
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I mean sure we get MPD rankings

652
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But there's only so much that tells us

653
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You know there's so many games out there

654
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And plus with digital distribution

655
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And all these different platforms

656
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
PC isn't accounted for in MPD

657
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So it's just you know

658
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
A little different

659
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Brad from Pod Culture

660
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Pushing back on the DC movies thing a little bit

661
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Does want to point out Wonder Woman was great

662
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So

663
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So

664
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
There is at least maybe a diamond in the rough

665
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Well you know a broken clock is right twice

666
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Alright anyway

667
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It used to be good

668
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's just up until recent

669
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
When they tried the

670
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You know Marvel Cinematic Universe the thing

671
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And then actually brought in somebody from Marvel Cinematic Universe

672
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But anyway this is not a

673
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
This is not a DC Marvel show

674
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's a video game show

675
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Unfortunately

676
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I will say

677
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Actually to end this on a positive note

678
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
To see how the industry has been reaching out

679
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
To the affected folks at Telltale

680
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Is really awesome

681
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Like there's a tweet out there

682
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Where Ubisoft San Francisco

683
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Is like

684
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Hey if you work there

685
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Come to BJ's Brewhouse

686
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
On such and such day

687
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
We're meeting and greeting people

688
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Our treat

689
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You know to try to fill positions

690
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And I think there's a lot of people out there

691
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Who want to help

692
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Because many people recognize

693
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
This sucks

694
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Because there's many people in the industry

695
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Who have been through this

696
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Far too many times

697
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Because of

698
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Bad decisions

699
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
By people that were

700
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
A little higher up on the food chain

701
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Unfortunately

702
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
This is not the only example

703
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Of this that's happened this week

704
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Right Logie?

705
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yes unfortunately not

706
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So

707
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Capcom's

708
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Vancouver studio

709
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Has shut down as well

710
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So

711
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
This isn't kind of

712
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Unexpected I guess

713
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Because they did

714
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Lay off

715
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
30% of the studio

716
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Back in February

717
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
But

718
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Now they have

719
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I guess

720
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
The remaining

721
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
158 people

722
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Will lose their jobs

723
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Due to the shutdown

724
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
They're going to keep

725
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
A skeleton crew remaining

726
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Until January 2019

727
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
To finalize the closure

728
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Operations and logistics

729
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But

730
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
For those who may not know

731
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Capcom Vancouver

732
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Was best known for the

733
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Dead Rising series

734
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But unfortunately

735
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
They said as a result

736
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Of reviewing titles and development

737
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
At Capcom Vancouver

738
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Capcom has decided to

739
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Cancel the development

740
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Of projects at the studio

741
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And will concentrate development

742
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
On major titles in Japan

743
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
So

744
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
No more Dead Rising

745
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
At least

746
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I guess not

747
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Not from this studio

748
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yeah and they were doing

749
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Dead Rising and I guess also

750
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
They had a

751
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Puzzle Fighter

752
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Was the other thing that they

753
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Worked on

754
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Oh and that game kind of

755
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
They already announced that

756
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
That game was going to close

757
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Not that long ago

758
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah that game

759
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I don't think did that

760
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Well

761
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Well

762
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I think they went

763
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
The wrong model with it

764
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Unfortunately

765
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah

766
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
But I thought the Puzzle Fighter

767
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Was going to get a release

768
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
In kind of the

769
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The more appropriate

770
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You know pay

771
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
20 bucks up front

772
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And get all the characters

773
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Type of thing

774
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I thought it was going to get

775
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
A release on Switch

776
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
PlayStation

777
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I guess maybe not now

778
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I don't know

779
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I don't know

780
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I don't know where that stands

781
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's also kind of nebulous

782
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
With the Telltale stuff

783
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I think it's kind of a given

784
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That

785
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Well they have like

786
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The stranger things

787
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The Netflix stuff

788
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Is not going to be happening

789
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah that's unfortunate

790
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I mean

791
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And ironically enough

792
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I want to say

793
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Let's see

794
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
There's a game actually

795
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Coming out

796
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
In just a couple weeks

797
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You know that's from Telltale

798
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Batman the enemy within

799
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
On the Switch

800
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Oops

801
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Maybe

802
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
In the sequel to the

803
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Other Batman series

804
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Which is weird though

805
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Because if like it did so terribly

806
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You'd think that they wouldn't

807
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Make a sequel to it

808
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Or well

809
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You know but also

810
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's one of those

811
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You have to weigh the cost

812
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Of how much to port it

813
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Versus you know

814
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
What's the likely return

815
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
On you know

816
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Going to another console

817
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Like the Switch

818
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And we've seen so many titles

819
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Kind of end up getting ported

820
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Over to the Switch

821
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
That they must think

822
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
There's you know

823
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Money to be made there

824
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I mean

825
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And in the case of Telltale

826
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Not to you know

827
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Take the spotlight off

828
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Which is important too

829
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
But

830
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Telltale does still have a

831
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Skeleton crew

832
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
We just don't know how

833
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
For how much longer

834
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So assumably

835
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
This crew that's left

836
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Is dealing with these

837
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Commitments that are already

838
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
There such as the Batman thing

839
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And whatever else is left

840
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But

841
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
For the most part

842
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The studio's done

843
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yeah

844
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And so for Capcom Vancouver

845
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's done done

846
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Right

847
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
They'll shift all that to

848
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Japan and what have you

849
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yep

850
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Well

851
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
That is unfortunate

852
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Fifth Dream in chat

853
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

854
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It says

855
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Man I was looking forward to

856
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Puzzle Fighter

857
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The mobile one literally had

858
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
A bug in the tutorial

859
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That prevented me from

860
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Ever playing

861
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Then again

862
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Maybe that's a sign of

863
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Why it went poof

864
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Um

865
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
When yeah

866
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
When bugs are reported

867
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You definitely need to act

868
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
On those bugs

869
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It's very fascinating

870
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I just feel like

871
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It seems like nowadays

872
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Testing is so sloppy

873
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Like with just this stuff

874
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Or that they just push

875
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Not necessarily maybe

876
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
That the testing's like

877
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Yeah

878
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
They're just like

879
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Eh it's fine

880
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Let's just put it out

881
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I think it's definitely

882
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I think the testing

883
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Isn't sloppy at all

884
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I think the testing

885
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Picks up a lot of stuff

886
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I think sometimes

887
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's a question of

888
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
What are we willing to

889
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Push the game back

890
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
To do

891
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Um

892
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
To fix and so forth

893
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And so uh

894
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
That is uh

895
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
That is

896
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Had a very interesting

897
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Effect here in the year

898
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
2018

899
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Cause I think a lot of games

900
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Have bugs that

901
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Well and no

902
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Get

903
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
They're identified in testing

904
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But the game comes out anyway

905
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I would bet

906
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You know Bethesda's infamous

907
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
For all the bug stuff

908
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I would bet so much of

909
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
That stuff gets called out

910
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And they say

911
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Um

912
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
We're gonna do it anyway

913
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Because you know

914
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Again it's

915
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Cost to fix

916
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
And the time table

917
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And are we gonna be able to

918
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Meet the shipping day

919
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And all that stuff

920
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Because so many games

921
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Have to be out in November

922
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You gotta

923
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
That's why they don't

924
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Bug fix

925
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
You know

926
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Skyrim anymore

927
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Oh but they'll fucking make

928
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You know

929
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
More DLC that they can

930
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Charge for

931
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I mean

932
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Mods

933
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
They can charge for

934
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Well I'm hoping

935
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You know

936
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
We've seen this happen

937
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
With movies

938
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Over the past few years

939
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
That you get

940
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Now not just in summer

941
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And the winter

942
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Holiday season

943
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You're seeing

944
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Big movies

945
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Basically year round

946
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You're seeing

947
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Big big movies

948
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Almost all times

949
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Throughout the year

950
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Except maybe early January

951
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Is the one time

952
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You don't really see

953
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Big big movies

954
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Anymore

955
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
But that's spreading

956
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
More year round

957
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And I kind of hope

958
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
We're getting to a similar

959
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Place with games

960
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
It sure feels like it

961
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Especially amongst the years

962
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
We've done

963
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
OLR here

964
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Is that I remember

965
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It was like

966
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
All the games

967
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Were in October

968
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
January

969
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
March

970
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Fiscal year

971
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Type of things

972
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
April

973
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And so forth

974
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
We're getting stuff

975
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Even in the summer

976
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And so forth

977
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
We're getting like

978
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
A big release

979
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
At least every month

980
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It's feeling a little bit

981
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
More year round

982
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And maybe that's gonna

983
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Help alleviate

984
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Some of the pressures

985
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
From investors

986
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
To deliver a product

987
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
At a certain time

988
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
At the sake of

989
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Keep the bugs in

990
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You know what I mean

991
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yeah

992
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
So

993
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It'll be interesting

994
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Anyway

995
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Let's see

996
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Going to chat

997
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Nope

998
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It's just weird

999
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
When it happens

1000
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
We can afford weird

1001
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Ship it

1002
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Let's see

1003
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Tigerclaw says

1004
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
That's true

1005
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
But even last year

1006
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Proved

1007
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You don't have

1008
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You don't have to

1009
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Release in the fall

1010
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
To be remembered

1011
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
For the Oscars

1012
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Get Out

1013
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I believe it had been

1014
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Released in like

1015
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
February or March

1016
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It was earlier

1017
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
In the year

1018
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And people remembered

1019
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
How good it was

1020
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
When awards season

1021
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Came around

1022
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So it doesn't

1023
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Always happen

1024
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But

1025
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You know

1026
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
There's ways to

1027
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Remind voters too

1028
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You know what I mean

1029
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
That's why you have

1030
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Those four year

1031
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Consideration campaigns

1032
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Around the Oscar season

1033
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Go to a website

1034
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Like deadline.com

1035
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Or variety.com

1036
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
These are like

1037
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Industry

1038
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
News wires

1039
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And they're

1040
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Targeted at people

1041
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
In the industry

1042
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And look at the

1043
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Type of ads

1044
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
That show up there

1045
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's all this

1046
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Four year

1047
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Consideration stuff

1048
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Like all

1049
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
All around awards season

1050
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Also don't ever

1051
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Ever ever ever

1052
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Look at TMZ

1053
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
TMZ is where you go

1054
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
When you want like

1055
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Gutter trash rumors

1056
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Well yeah

1057
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
What's Lindsay Lohan

1058
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Doing these days

1059
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm saying now

1060
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
That actually they're

1061
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
On my shit list

1062
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
For how they

1063
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Make money off

1064
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Of people's grief

1065
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Well that's

1066
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
That's not a new thing

1067
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Yeah but they're

1068
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Absolutely on my

1069
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Shit list now so

1070
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm not trying to

1071
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Sound like a jerk

1072
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But they should have

1073
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Been on your shit list

1074
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Years ago for that reason

1075
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Well they were

1076
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
But I'm calling on

1077
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Anyone who posts

1078
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Anything from them

1079
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Right now

1080
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
But here's the

1081
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Interesting thing

1082
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
About that

1083
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Their techniques

1084
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Are shitty

1085
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
They do find things out

1086
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
First unfortunately

1087
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Through that method

1088
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And there is this

1089
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Inherent human need

1090
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
To want to be

1091
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
First

1092
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
At something

1093
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Or first

1094
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I knew about that

1095
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Firsties first first

1096
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Those people

1097
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Need a life

1098
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
That's

1099
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'll tie this back

1100
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
To gaming

1101
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
That's why that

1102
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Thing they did

1103
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
In Pokemon Go

1104
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
This weekend

1105
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Was so brilliant

1106
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It was really brilliant

1107
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And if you don't

1108
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Try it

1109
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
When community day

1110
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Finished

1111
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
There was this

1112
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
New Pokemon

1113
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
No one had ever

1114
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Seen before

1115
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Unless maybe

1116
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
The nut thing

1117
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
The little nut thing

1118
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
The little nut

1119
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Ghost thing

1120
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
That showed up

1121
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
In the game

1122
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And because

1123
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Nobody had seen it

1124
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It wasn't teased

1125
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Every forum

1126
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Every website

1127
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Every chat I'm on

1128
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
That's even tangentially

1129
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
About Pokemon Go

1130
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You've got people

1131
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
That are posting

1132
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Look what I found

1133
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Look what I got

1134
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
The gag is

1135
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
That thing was

1136
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Everywhere

1137
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Like who didn't see

1138
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
That thing

1139
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
If they had

1140
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Their game open

1141
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
But people

1142
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Want to be first

1143
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And so Pokemon Go

1144
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Got all this free

1145
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Shout out on

1146
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Social media everywhere

1147
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Because of little

1148
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Nut monster mon

1149
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Which is probably

1150
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
The bonus Pokemon

1151
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
That's going to be

1152
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
In Pokemon Let's Go

1153
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Because they teased

1154
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
That even though

1155
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It's the 151

1156
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
From Kanto

1157
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
There will be an

1158
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Additional mon

1159
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
That shows up

1160
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
It's going to be

1161
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
That little dude

1162
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Yeah but when you

1163
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Catch it

1164
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It turns into a ditto

1165
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That was their

1166
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Little clever way

1167
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Of not letting you

1168
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Really catch it

1169
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Until

1170
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Gen 8 is announced

1171
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Or whatever

1172
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Dippy little thing

1173
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
They're going to do

1174
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I think they're just

1175
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Trolling people

1176
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I think it's awesome

1177
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It is

1178
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It is in a way

1179
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Let's see

1180
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
SDG100 Matt

1181
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
In chat says

1182
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
That was such a good troll

1183
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
He says

1184
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It was everywhere

1185
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Ten fold

1186
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
For the first 30 minutes

1187
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It's still around now

1188
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But the first 30 minutes

1189
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
After community day

1190
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Was over

1191
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Yeah it was everywhere

1192
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Well let's talk

1193
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
A little bit about

1194
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Community day

1195
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Or whatever

1196
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You were doing

1197
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
With your gaming week

1198
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And a little adventure

1199
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
We do called

1200
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
How was your gaming week

1201
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
So Dark Sakura

1202
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You can really do

1203
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
The whole month if you want

1204
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
But what kind of games

1205
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
You've been playing lately

1206
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Well it starts

1207
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
With a purchase

1208
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And I might have brought

1209
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
This up in one of my

1210
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Radio Magic things

1211
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
But on September 1st

1212
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Was mine and Dan's anniversary

1213
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You did talk about

1214
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
The pinball table

1215
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
If this is where we're going

1216
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Well I'm bringing it up

1217
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Again because it's

1218
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Fucking gorgeous

1219
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I have a theater

1220
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Finally and it's in

1221
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Perfect condition

1222
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Dan was like

1223
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I don't know what to do

1224
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
With the table

1225
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I don't have to work on

1226
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
We just play the shit out of it

1227
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And it's great

1228
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It's beautiful

1229
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So we have theater of magic

1230
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
We've also gotten

1231
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
The Shadow

1232
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And

1233
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Last Action Hero

1234
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Which actually more has

1235
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Sentimental value for us

1236
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And

1237
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I don't know some other one

1238
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
That I don't remember

1239
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
What we got

1240
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But whatever

1241
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Then

1242
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I've been playing

1243
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
A lot of Pokemon Go

1244
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I've played some Ingress

1245
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Just not a whole lot

1246
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm back to playing

1247
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Bejeweled for some reason

1248
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Which is actually

1249
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Kind of crazily addictive

1250
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And I'm still playing

1251
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Idolpouring

1252
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
But

1253
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
That's really about it

1254
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I've been very busy

1255
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Work is weird

1256
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And then all my volunteer

1257
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Stuff is taking up my time

1258
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Oh no I did play something else

1259
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Oh yeah

1260
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
We have the Nintendo out

1261
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
So I did actually play

1262
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
The Guardian Legend

1263
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Without it slowing me down

1264
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I love The Guardian Legend

1265
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
That's just

1266
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Let's just take a moment

1267
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Gaming perfection

1268
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
No Rob needs a moment of silence

1269
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I do

1270
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
For reasons

1271
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Other than that

1272
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I've just been looking at stuff

1273
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And going

1274
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Oh that'd be cute

1275
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Oh that'd be cute

1276
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Like gaming accessories

1277
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Like

1278
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Girlie shit

1279
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Like my Triforce necklace

1280
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
That I wore last night

1281
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And I was like

1282
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Oh you're wearing a Triforce

1283
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And I was like

1284
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Yeah it's a Triforce necklace

1285
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It's cool

1286
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You know just

1287
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Little stuff and

1288
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Oh and Dan and I

1289
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Watched a playthrough

1290
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
That was done like

1291
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
We weren't actually playing it

1292
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
But it was funny

1293
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Because we were watching

1294
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
A playthrough of like

1295
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Transformers Devastation

1296
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And it was done like a movie

1297
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
With the soundtrack for

1298
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Transformers the movie in it

1299
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
As in the real movie

1300
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Not these live action

1301
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Pieces of shit

1302
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Which by the way

1303
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I'm gonna see

1304
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Transformers the movie

1305
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
On the 27th

1306
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
In the theater

1307
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Bam

1308
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I know you're seeing it

1309
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
The week before

1310
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I'm seeing Gaga in

1311
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
A Star is Born

1312
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Because that came up

1313
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
On Facebook this week

1314
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm going to see

1315
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
The better movie

1316
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
No you're not

1317
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Years won't win an Oscar

1318
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
We've had people who

1319
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Were in that movie

1320
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
On this show

1321
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
No I know

1322
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I know

1323
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm not hating on

1324
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
The Transformers thing

1325
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I've also still decided

1326
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
That if anyone was gonna

1327
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Narrate my life

1328
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Maybe Morgan Freeman

1329
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Or Sammy L

1330
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Wanda Sykes for me

1331
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It'd be Greg Berger

1332
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
As Grimlock

1333
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I'm sure he's very

1334
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Happy to hear that

1335
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Well he seemed to be

1336
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Alright

1337
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
So no other games

1338
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
To share for now

1339
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Alright let's move over to

1340
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm sorry she didn't

1341
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Talk about World of Warcraft

1342
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Because I was gonna

1343
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Talk about World of

1344
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Oh yeah I did play

1345
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
World of Warcraft

1346
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Shit

1347
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
This bitch right here

1348
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Yeah no because

1349
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I've been kind of playing

1350
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Eradically

1351
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Because she keeps yelling

1352
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
At me that I'm not

1353
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Playing my Alliance

1354
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Character

1355
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
If you hop on Alliance

1356
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And then do the

1357
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Argus stuff with me

1358
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So I can actually go through

1359
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Some of those dungeons

1360
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I haven't done yet

1361
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You need to bring back

1362
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Sassy Pants

1363
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
She's still there

1364
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I didn't kill her

1365
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
You can remake her

1366
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
As a dark iron

1367
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Alright

1368
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Speaking of Pokemon Go

1369
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So this is like some

1370
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Late breaking news

1371
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Do do do do

1372
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
So a friend of mine

1373
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Is said he needs

1374
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Three new friends

1375
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
To finish his Mew quest

1376
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And so I'm like

1377
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
But the thing is

1378
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
All these people are

1379
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Replying to his post

1380
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Going

1381
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
People are still playing

1382
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Pokemon Go

1383
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Whatever

1384
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
This so last summer

1385
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
You know type

1386
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
That sort of thing

1387
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
So I said

1388
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
You know what buddy

1389
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
His name's Curtis

1390
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Curtis I'm gonna try to

1391
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Actually help you here

1392
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Do you want me to give out

1393
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Your code on the radio show

1394
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And see what kind of

1395
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Strangers add you

1396
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And he said yes

1397
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
So I would love it

1398
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
If you would all add

1399
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
My pal Curtis

1400
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
As your friend in Pokemon Go

1401
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
His code is

1402
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
So get out your phones

1403
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Everybody

1404
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
2 8 1 4

1405
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
6 3 0 8

1406
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
2 3 4 1

1407
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
He said I could do it

1408
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
So

1409
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I can't add him yet

1410
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Because I also

1411
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Need to add friends

1412
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
For that quest too

1413
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
At some point

1414
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Well then you both

1415
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Would get it

1416
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
But yeah

1417
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But I have to wait

1418
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Until I actually have to

1419
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Do that so you know

1420
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Okay

1421
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
This is completely real

1422
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
As you know

1423
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
This is completely real

1424
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Add him

1425
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Add him as your friend

1426
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
This is my pal Curtis

1427
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I'll be there before

1428
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Too long so

1429
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
My code will go out

1430
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I did the reality game

1431
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
On Facebook

1432
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
He was in it too

1433
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And he did a YouTube

1434
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
He's on a YouTube show

1435
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
That's a reality show

1436
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Called sequester

1437
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
So

1438
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
If you watch that

1439
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Type of garbage

1440
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
You might have seen

1441
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
This whole adding

1442
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Three friends thing

1443
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Makes me feel a lot like

1444
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
The whole ingress thing

1445
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Where they want you to

1446
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Recruit people

1447
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And it's like

1448
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I can't recruit people

1449
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Because no one wants

1450
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
To play this

1451
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Ingress

1452
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Ingress

1453
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
That badge doesn't do shit

1454
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It's like a vanity thing

1455
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Whereas in Pokemon

1456
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Like if you want to have Mew

1457
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
The problem is

1458
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
He really wants to have Mew

1459
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You

1460
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
You have to actually

1461
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Add people

1462
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
On Pokemon Go

1463
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So you have to add people

1464
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
But I already added people

1465
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Why do I have to add more people?

1466
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I am actually in a Sacramento area

1467
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Pokemon Go player group

1468
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
That all you have to do

1469
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Is post in there

1470
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And people will add you

1471
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
If you want

1472
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Yeah

1473
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
All right

1474
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Well we got

1475
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I see act deaf says

1476
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'll add him

1477
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And so there's some people

1478
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Saying they're gonna add

1479
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
So I appreciate that

1480
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Do that

1481
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Add him

1482
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
All right

1483
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Loki

1484
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I played Pokemon Go a little bit

1485
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And

1486
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I don't know

1487
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
What else

1488
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I loaded up an emulator

1489
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
On my computer

1490
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
To play

1491
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Ridge Racer R4

1492
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Because I saw the announcement

1493
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
That came out

1494
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I was like

1495
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Oh yeah I like that game

1496
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Let me try playing that again

1497
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I did not age well

1498
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I don't know

1499
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It's all right

1500
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I like Ridge Racer R4

1501
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I mean it's one of the best

1502
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Ridge Racer games

1503
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
But it does not look good

1504
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
On that emulator

1505
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It just

1506
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I don't know

1507
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
What magic they're gonna be able

1508
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
To do on the TV

1509
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
To make it look fantastic

1510
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Like I remember it

1511
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But that was not it

1512
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
But it's still fun

1513
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And then

1514
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
What else did I play

1515
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I tried a little bit

1516
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I was gonna download

1517
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
The Forza Horizon 4 demo

1518
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
But I'm like

1519
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Do I really need to download

1520
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
A demo

1521
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I'll just buy the game

1522
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
When it comes out

1523
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
When you know

1524
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You're already gonna buy the game

1525
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Yeah it's like

1526
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I'll just buy the game

1527
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
When it comes out

1528
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
For what it's worth

1529
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It gives you a little bit

1530
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Of a jump start

1531
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
On the game

1532
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And there's like

1533
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
A clothing item

1534
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You unlock

1535
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Whoopty shit

1536
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
But you get a little shirt

1537
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
For doing the first part

1538
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Of the demo

1539
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
A shirt for a driver

1540
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
That's in a car

1541
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
That I never see

1542
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Well actually no

1543
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You see the driver

1544
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Because they change

1545
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
The little recaps

1546
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
So you see the little driver

1547
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Standing next to the car

1548
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Going fuck yeah

1549
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I won

1550
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
So you do see the drivers

1551
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
In like the recap screens

1552
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Oh yeah

1553
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Well

1554
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It's very much a vanity thing though

1555
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It's very very much a vanity thing

1556
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
You can't run over the sheep

1557
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
The sheep will always avoid the car

1558
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
That sounds like a challenge

1559
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Uh yeah

1560
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
That was posted in our Discord

1561
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
There was a little video

1562
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Where the sheep are programmed

1563
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So that they consistently

1564
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Run away from the car

1565
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
So

1566
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Get enough cars

1567
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Lined up

1568
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Anything's possible

1569
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Loki wants to kill the sheep

1570
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It's just because they tell me

1571
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I can't kill the sheep

1572
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I mean come on

1573
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
We're the classic days of

1574
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You know cruising

1575
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
USA and stuff like that

1576
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Carmageddon

1577
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
We're eating like

1578
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Smashing the deer

1579
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And it just

1580
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Gives everywhere

1581
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Gross

1582
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Alright anything else for your gaming week?

1583
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Um

1584
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
No I think that was it

1585
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Okay my gaming week

1586
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Let me start with some of the stuff

1587
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
That's been discussed already

1588
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
So World of Warcraft

1589
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I am continuing my adventures

1590
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
In World of Warcraft

1591
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So unlike Jamie

1592
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I've been playing Horde

1593
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Simply because my druid

1594
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Is on Horde

1595
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And I really wanted to play my druid

1596
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Um

1597
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And

1598
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Yeah

1599
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Although I was really kind of bored

1600
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Because my guild had like

1601
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Nobody playing in it

1602
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
So I moved to a different guild

1603
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I'm in a guild with Dr. Ken

1604
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
From Starboard Power Coupling

1605
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And so there's a few more chatty people there

1606
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
So it's nice

1607
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It's nice to like

1608
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Not be playing an MMO by myself

1609
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Um

1610
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I think that helps World of Warcraft

1611
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Be a little better

1612
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And yeah I'm kind of into it

1613
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Like I'm

1614
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I'm into this expansion

1615
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I don't know how long I will be

1616
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Because I tend to like

1617
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Go through the leveling up thing

1618
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
And then once I hit max level

1619
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I'm like

1620
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Eh fuck rating

1621
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And I kind of fizzle out

1622
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
But we'll see

1623
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
We'll see how long this keeps my interest

1624
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I like that they have

1625
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
You know

1626
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It seems like there's more of a variety

1627
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Of things to do

1628
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
As you level up

1629
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I like that they have like

1630
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
This whole island expedition thing

1631
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
It's kind of neat

1632
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I just did one of those today

1633
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
And so it was like

1634
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Kind of like a

1635
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
PvP

1636
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
But it wasn't actually other players

1637
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It was computer controlled

1638
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
AI

1639
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And it was like

1640
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
You have to mine as much Azerite

1641
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
As you can on the island

1642
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Faster than the other team

1643
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Um

1644
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And I thought it was kind of a neat

1645
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Little like minigame

1646
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So yeah

1647
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
That was cool

1648
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Um

1649
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I played that

1650
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And uh

1651
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Yeah

1652
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It's kind of what I've been doing

1653
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
In World of Warcraft

1654
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I also started Diablo 3

1655
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Again

1656
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Because season 15 just started on Friday

1657
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So

1658
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Gotta start another new character

1659
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And get all the cosmetic rewards

1660
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
From getting to level 70

1661
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
And all that stuff

1662
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So

1663
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I started doing that

1664
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Uh

1665
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Playing Diablo 3

1666
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Uh

1667
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Pokemon Go

1668
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Community day

1669
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Was this past weekend

1670
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Had a lot of fun

1671
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Just walking around the capital

1672
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I feel like with Chikorita

1673
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Man

1674
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Those were crazy

1675
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Like

1676
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I'm just talking like

1677
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
The number of Chikorita

1678
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
That were around

1679
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Like were more than any other

1680
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Community day

1681
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Yeah

1682
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And the shinies too

1683
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Because I got like three or four shinies

1684
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,080
And I was able to evolve like two whole

1685
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,600
Chikorita sets

1686
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
And

1687
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,960
Everybody in my group got five or six shinies

1688
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,160
And we also

1689
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,560
And we never do this

1690
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,160
We took time out of Community day

1691
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,160
To raid

1692
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,440
So we went and re-rated

1693
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
Over at um

1694
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,800
The theater at the convention center

1695
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,000
Had a Mewtwo that popped

1696
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,400
You have to see my picture on Twitter

1697
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,560
There were like 300 people

1698
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,480
Swarming around this building

1699
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,480
Where there was a Mewtwo

1700
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,480
And just you know

1701
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
Obviously you would go in

1702
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,480
And the lobby would be full

1703
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,480
Although we did

1704
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,480
We ended up doing a private group

1705
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,480
So that we could just

1706
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,480
All increase our friendship levels

1707
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,480
And all that

1708
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,480
Um

1709
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
So

1710
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
And we took out Mewtwo there

1711
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,480
And then we went to the church

1712
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,480
You know at the capital park

1713
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,480
Here in SAC

1714
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,480
You know there's that church

1715
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
That's right across the street

1716
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
That's a gym as well

1717
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,680
So Mewtwo popped there too

1718
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,960
And so you had all these people

1719
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,960
Lining the street

1720
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,960
On one side

1721
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,960
And all these people lining the street

1722
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
On the other

1723
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,960
Doing the same thing

1724
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,960
And there was a Mewtwo that was there

1725
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,960
So it was just

1726
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,960
It was crazy

1727
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,960
But it was cool

1728
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,960
Um

1729
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,960
But yeah it was

1730
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,960
It was interesting

1731
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,960
By 1.30

1732
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,960
Which um

1733
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,960
You know Pacific time

1734
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,960
Community day goes

1735
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,960
11 am to 2 pm

1736
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,960
So by 1.30

1737
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,960
We were like

1738
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,960
It's getting hot

1739
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,960
Supposed to be like 94 today

1740
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,960
Um

1741
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,960
Are we kind of done?

1742
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,960
And everyone was like

1743
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
Yeah we're done

1744
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,960
We've got like five

1745
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,960
Six shinies

1746
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,960
We're good

1747
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,960
So we called it a day

1748
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,960
Like 30 minutes early

1749
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,960
Which we never do

1750
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,960
Yeah

1751
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,960
Because like

1752
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,960
With EV community day

1753
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,960
There's like 10 shinies

1754
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,960
Into each of the set

1755
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,960
You know

1756
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,960
Of EVs

1757
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,960
So you could have like

1758
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,960
A ton of different shiny EVs

1759
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,960
Basically

1760
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,960
But

1761
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,960
I don't know

1762
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,960
Chikorita is like

1763
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,960
Eh

1764
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,960
Eh

1765
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
I don't really want this

1766
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,960
Yeah

1767
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
Well no

1768
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,960
Chikorita is cool

1769
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,960
It's actually

1770
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,960
Ironically it's pumpkin spice

1771
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,960
Chikorita

1772
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
Is what it looks like to me

1773
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,960
So

1774
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,960
An appropriate fall flavor

1775
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,960
I got a shiny Charmander

1776
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,960
The other day

1777
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,960
Oh just randomly?

1778
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,960
Just randomly

1779
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,960
Yeah it's nice that once you have

1780
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,960
Like the community day

1781
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,960
Then the shinies are kind of like

1782
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,960
Good

1783
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,960
They're just like

1784
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Less of a spawn

1785
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,960
But you'll find them

1786
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,960
Like the

1787
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,960
Well they didn't get a community day

1788
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,960
But those swabloos

1789
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,960
Like I've

1790
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,960
I just randomly have picked up

1791
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,960
Two of them

1792
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,960
Just catching like

1793
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,960
Regular Pokemon

1794
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,960
It's kind of

1795
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,960
Kind of cool

1796
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,960
Other games that I've played

1797
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,960
Doesn't stop there

1798
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,960
So I've also been playing

1799
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,960
Forza Horizon 4

1800
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,960
I downloaded the demo for that

1801
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,960
So the

1802
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,960
I did download the demo

1803
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,960
Because I wanted to get in there

1804
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,960
And

1805
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,960
So it starts with

1806
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,960
You rate

1807
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
It's very much like

1808
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,960
Shoving down your throat

1809
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,960
Did you know that this game

1810
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,960
Has seasons?

1811
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,960
And so it's like

1812
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,960
Race through the autumn season

1813
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,960
Now race through the winter season

1814
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,960
Now it's the summer

1815
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,960
So you go

1816
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,960
Does it change as you go

1817
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,960
Throughout the year

1818
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,960
Or is it just

1819
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,960
Not in this demo

1820
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,960
In the demo

1821
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,960
I know the demo doesn't

1822
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,960
The demo just kind of like

1823
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,960
Like because it was four

1824
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,960
Different type of races

1825
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,960
Like it started with like

1826
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,960
A very generic type of race

1827
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,960
In the autumn

1828
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,960
And then the winner was like

1829
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,960
You were in this big dune buggy

1830
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,960
Going through the snow

1831
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,960
And you did like this big ramp

1832
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,960
And then summer

1833
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,960
I remember you're racing

1834
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
Motorcycles

1835
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,960
And the motorcycles all had

1836
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,960
And it was a really cool effect

1837
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,960
Like one thing I just love

1838
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,960
About Forza

1839
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,960
Is that it's extra as fuck

1840
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,960
Like it's so extra

1841
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,960
Like you'll be driving down

1842
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,960
Like confetti cannons

1843
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,960
Going off everywhere

1844
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,960
And like the sheep

1845
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,960
Chasing the sheep

1846
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,960
I consider as like

1847
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,960
An extra thing too

1848
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,960
And it's just like

1849
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,960
Extra extra extra

1850
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,960
And since you know what

1851
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,960
Since this week Mario Kart

1852
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,960
Got ruined for a lot of us

1853
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,960
I'll just leave it at that

1854
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,960
Mario Kart

1855
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,960
And one particular character

1856
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,960
In Mario Kart

1857
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,960
Got ruined for a lot of people

1858
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,960
So people are gonna be funny

1859
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,960
A break maybe

1860
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,960
I think Forza

1861
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,960
You know it's a very different

1862
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,960
type of game

1863
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,960
But I just love how

1864
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,960
Over the top it is

1865
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,960
It's why I prefer

1866
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,960
The Horizon series

1867
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,960
Way much more than the mainline

1868
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,960
Forza Motorsport games

1869
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,960
It's just

1870
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,960
It's arcadey

1871
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,960
And it's so extra

1872
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,960
Like flying

1873
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,960
So you do the season thing

1874
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,960
And I honestly thought

1875
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,960
That was gonna be it

1876
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,960
I was like

1877
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,960
Oh is that

1878
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,960
I downloaded 25 gigs for that

1879
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,960
That's gonna be it

1880
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,960
But then no

1881
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,960
The game starts up

1882
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,960
It's like

1883
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,960
So what do you want

1884
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,960
Your name to be

1885
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,960
And what's awesome

1886
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,960
Like they've recorded

1887
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,960
Like 500 names

1888
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,960
So you can like

1889
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,960
Have the announcer

1890
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,960
Call you my name right

1891
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,960
But one of the nicknames

1892
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,960
You can be

1893
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,960
Roberts

1894
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,960
So they call me Roberts

1895
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,960
So

1896
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,960
Which is kind of funny

1897
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,960
So I play the game as that

1898
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,960
And it lets you start the game

1899
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,960
So you do this race

1900
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,960
You do another race

1901
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,960
And then you do like a stunt

1902
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,960
They're like

1903
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,960
We want you to be a stunt double

1904
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,960
In this new movie

1905
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,960
And you do a stunt race

1906
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,960
Where you go like

1907
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,960
Flying through a windmill

1908
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,960
And you fly off the cliff

1909
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,960
Into a field

1910
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,960
And it looks

1911
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,960
Like I was playing

1912
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
My PC

1913
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,960
And my PC can only run

1914
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,960
On like medium settings

1915
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,960
Because you know

1916
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,960
Even though my computer

1917
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,960
Is like two years old

1918
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,960
At this point

1919
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,960
It was top of the line

1920
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,960
When I got it

1921
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,960
Well it's only two years old

1922
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,960
Now you know

1923
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,960
It's like

1924
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,960
Might as well bought it

1925
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,960
A decade ago

1926
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,960
Um

1927
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,960
But it looked beautiful

1928
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,960
Even in the medium mode

1929
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,960
So um

1930
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,960
Yeah I was

1931
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,960
Enjoying Forza

1932
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,960
So cool

1933
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,960
Cool

1934
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,960
Um

1935
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,960
I think that's probably it

1936
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,960
Finally for my gaming week

1937
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,960
I think that's most of the stuff

1938
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,960
I've been playing this week

1939
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,960
Bobby says the seasons

1940
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,960
Change every week

1941
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,960
Like real week

1942
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,960
Yeah

1943
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,960
Or

1944
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,960
Because

1945
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,960
I know it keeps telling me

1946
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,960
It says um

1947
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,960
Um

1948
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,960
Progress towards autumn

1949
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,960
And then autumn unlocked

1950
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,960
But I haven't unlocked it yet

1951
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,960
Because I had to stop the demo

1952
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,960
Because I was just doing it today

1953
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,960
So I had to stop the demo

1954
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,960
To prep for OLR

1955
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,960
I did the stunt race thing

1956
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,960
And that's where I stopped the demo

1957
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
But I saw a hella

1958
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,960
Like other people

1959
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,960
On my Xbox friends list

1960
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,960
Like every race I did

1961
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,960
Was completely full

1962
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,960
With gamer tags

1963
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,960
From my Xbox

1964
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,960
Like I raced against

1965
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,960
Black Wolf

1966
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,960
I mean I know it's not really them

1967
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,960
Because I whooped them all

1968
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,960
And that would not have happened

1969
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,960
If they had been the real drivers

1970
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,960
But it's still kind of fun to see

1971
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,960
You know

1972
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,960
Stuff based off your friends

1973
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,960
Or whatever so

1974
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,960
That's pretty cool

1975
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,960
Um

1976
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,960
Bobby Black Wolf says

1977
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:38,960
Yes every real week

1978
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,960
The season changes

1979
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,960
Interesting

1980
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,960
Bobby also points out

1981
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,960
That's just the Drivatar system

1982
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,960
Yeah

1983
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,960
Well the nice thing is

1984
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,960
You'll all see my license plate

1985
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,960
So my license plate was

1986
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,960
Hi

1987
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,960
That's my license plate

1988
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,960
H-I-E

1989
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,960
Hi

1990
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,960
So enjoy that

1991
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,960
Alright

1992
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,960
S2100 Matt says

1993
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,960
I need this game to come out already

1994
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,960
I also wish I had an Xbox One X

1995
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,960
And a 4K TV to fully enjoy it

1996
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,960
Uh

1997
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,960
What early access

1998
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,960
On September 28th

1999
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,960
I don't believe in the early

2000
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,960
Like they want you to buy

2001
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,960
The Ultra

2002
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,960
Edition

2003
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:06,960
You know

2004
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,960
The like hundred dollar

2005
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,960
Forza

2006
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,960
Comes with early

2007
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,960
You don't need the game that quick

2008
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,960
Like give it a

2009
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,960
I think it comes out

2010
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,960
Like a week later

2011
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,960
For everybody else

2012
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,960
So

2013
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:16,960
Oh

2014
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,960
Yeah

2015
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,960
Maybe you do need the game that quick

2016
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,960
I don't know

2017
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,960
It's your money

2018
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,960
Spend it how you want

2019
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,960
It's only on the second

2020
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,960
I think

2021
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,960
Yeah

2022
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,960
You don't have to wait that long for it

2023
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:26,960
It's coming out soon

2024
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,960
Alright so that was my gaming week

2025
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:28,960
Let's move on

2026
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,960
Announcements

2027
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,960
I don't really have a lot of

2028
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,960
A ton of things to say

2029
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,960
Um

2030
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,960
Since we had the unexpected week off

2031
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,960
Earlier in the month

2032
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,960
We don't really have anything planned

2033
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,960
Until probably

2034
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,960
Um

2035
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,960
I don't even know if we'll be off the week

2036
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:39,960
Thanks

2037
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,960
Probably not until the holidays

2038
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,960
We'll be looking at any shows off

2039
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,960
At least planned ones

2040
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,960
Knock on wood

2041
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,960
Hopefully nothing unexpected happens

And we also have

2048
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,960
The Orange Lounge Radio

2049
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,960
Let's get into some longer news tonight

2050
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,960
And some other things that are happening

2051
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,960
In the gaming world

2052
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,960
Loki we'll start with you

2053
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,960
Yes

2054
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,960
It's the PlayStation Classic

2055
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,960
You might think

2056
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,960
Hey wait a second

2057
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,960
Isn't Nintendo the one that releases

2058
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,960
These consoles that are smaller

2059
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,960
That are a hundred bucks

2060
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,960
That have games in them

2061
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,960
But no

2062
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,960
Sony wants to jump in on that

2063
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,960
Like they did on motion control

2064
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,960
And they want a piece of that action

2065
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,960
So

2066
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,960
Coming out December 3rd

2067
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,960
In US Canada

2068
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,960
Europe

2069
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,960
Japan and Australia

2070
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,960
You're gonna get

2071
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,960
A PlayStation Classic for

2072
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,960
99.99

2073
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,960
Or you know

2074
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,960
The equivalent in your territory

2075
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,960
And they will include 20 games

2076
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,960
As well as two controllers

2077
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,960
It won't include an AC adapter though

2078
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,960
But it will be bundled with USB cable

2079
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,960
That you can power it by

2080
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,960
I think that's dumb

2081
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,960
But whatever

2082
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,960
Games that they've announced so far

2083
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,960
They're gonna be in there

2084
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,960
Final Fantasy 7

2085
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,960
Jumping Flash

2086
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,960
Ridge Racer

2087
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,960
Type 4

2088
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,960
Tekken 3

2089
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,960
And Wild Arms

2090
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,960
It's not a bad lineup so far

2091
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,960
I'd be interested to see

2092
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,960
How we can hack this thing

2093
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,960
Cause you know it's gonna happen day one

2094
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,960
It always does

2095
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,960
I would even be more surprised

2096
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,960
If it isn't running the same hardware

2097
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,960
As the SNES Classic and stuff

2098
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,960
Cause I think those you can actually run

2099
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,960
PlayStation Emulators in as well

2100
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,960
But yeah

2101
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,960
This thing will be running Nintendo games

2102
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,960
In no time

2103
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,960
You know

2104
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,960
Okay speaking of all that

2105
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,960
Something I completely forgot

2106
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,960
And left out of my gaming week

2107
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,960
Was that I did play those NES Classics

2108
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:29,960
On Tuesday night

2109
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:30,960
Oh yeah

2110
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,960
I got the whole online thing

2111
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:32,960
And I purchased that

2112
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,960
And I looked at that

2113
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,960
I'm like

2114
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,960
No I played

2115
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,960
Bobby was streaming

2116
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,960
So I'm still having the cable issues at home

2117
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:38,960
So I can't stream to Twitch

2118
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:39,960
I mean I can do the radio show

2119
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,960
Cause it's low bandwidth

2120
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,960
But I can't do Twitch

2121
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,960
But I was like

2122
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:44,960
Well if I can't do my own stream

2123
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,960
I'll crash someone else's

2124
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,960
So I went on to Bobby

2125
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:47,960
You didn't fix your cable

2126
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,960
When they came out here

2127
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,960
Okay so long story short

2128
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,960
The guy that was here

2129
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,960
Like he definitely tried

2130
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,960
And he was definitely like

2131
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:55,960
Okay I do see a problem

2132
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:56,960
And he showed me

2133
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,960
And he listened to what I was saying

2134
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,960
And he like

2135
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,960
Okay yeah I get it

2136
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,960
I see what your problem is

2137
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,960
Cool

2138
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,960
And he actually went up the pole

2139
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,960
And looked and he's like

2140
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,960
Look at what I'm seeing

2141
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,960
He showed me

2142
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,960
He's like

2143
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,960
See all this noise here

2144
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,960
This is a problem

2145
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,960
I want to see which outlet

2146
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,960
Is coming from

2147
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,960
He looked at the outlets

2148
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:12,960
He said

2149
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,960
Okay your living room outlet

2150
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:14,960
Is a problem

2151
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,960
And he said

2152
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,960
Okay so see

2153
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,960
Now all the noise is gone

2154
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,960
So give it 24 hours

2155
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,960
And see where it's gonna be at from here

2156
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,960
So I was like

2157
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:21,960
Okay

2158
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,960
At least this guy listened to me

2159
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:23,960
He showed me something tangible

2160
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:24,960
He was working on

2161
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,960
I'm like totally like

2162
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,960
Happy

2163
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,960
But the problem is

2164
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:28,960
He didn't fix it

2165
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,960
I mean

2166
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,960
He tried

2167
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,960
You tried

2168
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,960
But unfortunately he didn't fix the issue

2169
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,960
So I gotta

2170
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:34,960
In all fairness

2171
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,960
Comcast was supposed to follow up with me

2172
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,960
They haven't

2173
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,960
So I'll have to run that up the flagpole again

2174
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,960
I've just been kinda

2175
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,960
On other things this week

2176
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,960
Where I'm just kinda getting used to this life

2177
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:44,960
Where it's like

2178
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,960
I guess I'm not gonna be able to stream to Twitch

2179
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,960
Although that's gonna be a problem

2180
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,960
When this show wants to move to Twitch

2181
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,960
But uh

2182
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,960
We'll just have to cross that bridge

2183
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:52,960
And we get to it

2184
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,960
We may have to move the place we do this show

2185
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,960
We'll see

2186
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,960
Well I hear that Verizon's got

2187
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,960
Their 5G or whatever that they're offering now

2188
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,960
With their service

2189
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,960
For 50 bucks a month

2190
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:02,960
Gigabit down

2191
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,960
And apparently

2192
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,960
Um

2193
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,960
It's in Sacramento

2194
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,960
Sure

2195
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,960
Not where I live

2196
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,960
Yeah

2197
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,960
Slightly outside of Sacramento

2198
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:12,960
But in Sacramento proper

2199
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,960
They get all the fucking nice shit

2200
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,960
Does that count Sacramento County

2201
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,960
Because I'm not in Sacramento proper

2202
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,960
I'm in Sacramento County

2203
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:18,960
Yeah

2204
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,960
Yeah

2205
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,960
Exactly

2206
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,960
So anyway

2207
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:22,960
But you're closer

2208
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,960
Than I am so

2209
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,960
So anyway

2210
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,960
No resolution to that yet

2211
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,960
So I was crashing Bobby's stream

2212
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,960
And we were playing

2213
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,960
Now we tried to play the online multiplayer

2214
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,960
It did lag a little bit

2215
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,960
Like I could feel

2216
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,960
A little sluggishness

2217
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,960
Like playing

2218
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,960
Muddy waters type of thing

2219
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,960
Like when I was playing

2220
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,960
Super Mario Brothers

2221
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:40,960
Like this doesn't

2222
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,960
This doesn't snap

2223
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,960
The way it should

2224
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,960
When I play it usually

2225
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:44,960
Like it wasn't horrific

2226
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,960
But it was definitely noticeable

2227
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,960
But what we did

2228
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:49,960
And we don't know what that could

2229
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,960
Could that be my cable problems at home

2230
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:52,960
Could that be the fact

2231
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,960
He's streaming

2232
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:54,960
And doing the NES

2233
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,960
Who knows

2234
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,960
So we put it into low latency mode

2235
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,960
And it was fine

2236
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,960
So if you have problems playing

2237
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,960
Online with your friends

2238
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,960
Go look for that low latency mode

2239
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,960
And turn it on

2240
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,960
Because I don't know why

2241
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,960
Low latency isn't on by default

2242
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,960
But for whatever reason it's not

2243
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,960
Why is there even a mode to turn that on

2244
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,960
If that makes it run good

2245
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,960
I don't understand

2246
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:16,960
Like what

2247
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:17,960
I'm not sure

2248
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,960
Maybe somebody in chat knows

2249
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,960
Maybe Bobby or something

2250
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,960
What are you sacrificing

2251
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,960
To get low latency

2252
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,960
Because that's where my mind is

2253
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,960
Like why would that not be the norm

2254
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,960
Is it that I can't stream the whole game

2255
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,960
I mean literally the game downloads

2256
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,960
Faster than a

2257
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,960
You know

2258
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,960
Than a web page

2259
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:32,960
I don't understand what

2260
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,960
What you would be

2261
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:35,960
Sacrificing in low latency

2262
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,960
Yeah I didn't understand that either

2263
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:38,960
But anyway

2264
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,960
To register participation

2265
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:42,960
For this week's episode

2266
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:43,960
Of Orange Lounge Radio

2267
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,960
At vognetwork.com

2268
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:45,960
Use the passphrase

2269
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,960
COAST

2270
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,960
It worked fine in low latency mode

2271
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,960
And we had a good time

2272
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,960
It's just that

2273
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:51,960
There's not a lot of like

2274
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:52,960
Riveting two player games

2275
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:53,960
We played Dr. Mario

2276
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:54,960
We tried to play Double Dragon

2277
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,960
And then realized

2278
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,960
Oh yeah

2279
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:57,960
NES Double Dragon

2280
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,960
They had that shitty little versus mode

2281
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:00,960
For two player

2282
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,960
But the game itself

2283
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,960
Was not two player simultaneous

2284
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:04,960
Like it was in the arcade

2285
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,960
I think Double Dragon 2 had that

2286
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,960
But not the first Double Dragon

2287
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,960
So

2288
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:09,960
It didn't

2289
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,960
I know right

2290
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,960
It didn't

2291
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,960
No it didn't

2292
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,960
And so

2293
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,960
I don't know

2294
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,960
We were going to play

2295
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:16,960
River City Ransom

2296
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,960
But then by that time

2297
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:18,960
Dinner was done

2298
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:19,960
So we never

2299
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,960
Got around to playing

2300
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:21,960
That stuff

2301
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,960
So maybe a stream

2302
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,960
Later in the week

2303
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,960
I don't know

2304
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,960
But anyway

2305
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,960
The reason why I brought all that up

2306
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,960
It does tie into the Sony thing

2307
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:28,960
I'm not trying to take the spotlight off this

2308
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,960
But you were talking about

2309
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:30,960
When does that thing get hacked

2310
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,960
Well the Nintendo thing

2311
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,960
Got hacked within 24 hours

2312
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,960
They were running Kirby on that thing

2313
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,960
By loading the ROM

2314
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,960
So

2315
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,960
And that's

2316
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,960
Was kind of

2317
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:40,960
A shocking

2318
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,960
Well I don't want to say shocked

2319
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,960
You probably weren't shocked Loki

2320
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,960
But in some ways I think

2321
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,960
I was so surprised

2322
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,960
Some of us were really

2323
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,960
Having to deal with the reality of

2324
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,960
Nintendo was not doing anything

2325
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:50,960
To tweak these games

2326
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,960
To run online

2327
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:52,960
They were not in there

2328
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,960
Doing with the code or anything

2329
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,960
Nintendo is artificially holding back

2330
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,960
Releasing games on this thing

2331
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,960
Because there is nothing

2332
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:02,960
To prevent

2333
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,960
Nintendo first party titles anyway

2334
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,960
From being on Netflix today

2335
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,960
Like Super Mario Brothers 2

2336
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,960
No reason that should be missing right now

2337
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,960
Kirby

2338
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,960
No reason that should be missing right now

2339
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,960
Things that are first party

2340
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,960
Now I completely understand

2341
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,960
You may have licensing things with Konami

2342
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,960
Although they have Gradius today

2343
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,960
You may still have things with Capcom

2344
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:23,960
You know I understand

2345
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,960
Not everything could be there

2346
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:26,960
Especially third party stuff

2347
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,960
But as far as Nintendo first party stuff

2348
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,960
It is artificially being held back

2349
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:32,960
And so

2350
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,960
I think a lot of us are kind of having to

2351
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:35,960
Swallow that pill this week

2352
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,960
That you know

2353
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,960
Alright

2354
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,960
This is how Nintendo is going to do it

2355
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,960
I mean

2356
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,960
Is it still the better alternative

2357
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,960
To charging five dollars a game

2358
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,960
Probably

2359
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,960
But it is a little bit frustrating

2360
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,960
That this could have been a big thing

2361
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,960
This thing could have landed with a thud

2362
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,960
And now it's kind of landing with a

2363
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,960
Okay

2364
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,960
Neat

2365
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,960
Yeah they could have said

2366
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,960
Hey Virtual Console 2.0

2367
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,960
Now they have multiplayer

2368
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:59,960
Here's a ton of games

2369
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,960
We're going to sell to you

2370
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,960
For like five bucks each

2371
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,960
Or whatever

2372
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,960
And people are like

2373
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,960
Oh yeah

2374
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,960
And they could have made so much money

2375
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,960
And kept

2376
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:07,960
And

2377
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,960
Kept multiplayer free

2378
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,960
So they would have

2379
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,960
You know

2380
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:12,960
The advantage of showing

2381
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:13,960
Oh hey

2382
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:14,960
We don't

2383
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,960
Because you know

2384
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,960
They could probably make up that

2385
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:17,960
Twenty bucks in Virtual Console sales

2386
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,960
Easy

2387
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,960
You know

2388
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,960
Because some people are going to purchase

2389
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,960
More some less

2390
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:22,960
And they could have

2391
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,960
Hey look

2392
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,960
We don't charge for our multiplayer

2393
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:26,960
But no

2394
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,960
No

2395
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,960
They didn't do that

2396
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:29,960
Instead

2397
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,960
Nintendo fans

2398
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,960
Are going to stop them

2399
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:32,960
Hackers proved

2400
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,960
That

2401
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,960
This hold back is artificial

2402
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,960
This week

2403
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:36,960
So

2404
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,960
Take

2405
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:38,960
Take what it is

2406
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,960
Uh

2407
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,960
Let's see

2408
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,960
Act Efton Chat says

2409
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,960
I can play Kirby's Adventure

2410
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:43,960
And I have it on the Wii

2411
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:44,960
And 3DS on the 3D Classic

2412
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,960
So I can wait

2413
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:46,960
Uh

2414
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,960
Dark Tetsuya says

2415
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:48,960
My only explanation is

2416
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:49,960
Perhaps they didn't want people

2417
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,960
To be overwhelmed

2418
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,960
With a hundred games at launch

2419
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,960
Why not though?

2420
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,960
Imagine what a bombshell that would have been

2421
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:56,960
If it's like

2422
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,960
Dude we just opened the fucking floodgates

2423
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,960
I can think of one reason

2424
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:00,960
Their eShop

2425
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,960
Is

2426
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:02,960
Fucking

2427
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,960
Terrible

2428
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:04,960
Is why

2429
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:05,960
And discoverability on that

2430
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:06,960
Would be fucking terrible

2431
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,960
It's all in one package

2432
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:09,960
Oh yeah

2433
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,960
You're not downloading game

2434
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,960
By game by game

2435
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:12,960
It's one

2436
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:13,960
NES

2437
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,960
And then once you get in there

2438
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:15,960
You have all the different box arts

2439
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,960
And things

2440
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:17,960
But I believe

2441
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,960
I didn't play a lot with this

2442
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,960
I believe you can rearrange them

2443
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,960
And pin your favorites to the top

2444
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:22,960
You can kind of play with it

2445
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,960
It's no worse than

2446
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,960
Actually using Netflix

2447
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,960
And I'm sure when the library

2448
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:29,960
Does get bigger

2449
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,960
You'll probably see similar

2450
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,960
Stuff

2451
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,960
Is it to not devalue the

2452
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,960
NES Classic

2453
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,960
Maybe?

2454
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,960
I mean

2455
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:36,960
Maybe

2456
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,960
Because like

2457
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,960
Isn't there a lot of overlap

2458
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:39,960
In the NES Classic

2459
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,960
In what this offers

2460
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:41,960
I mean as far as like games

2461
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:42,960
Uh

2462
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,960
There

2463
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:44,960
It's not a hundred percent

2464
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,960
But certainly

2465
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,960
Things like Mario Brothers

2466
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:47,960
Mario 3

2467
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,960
Zelda

2468
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,960
Absolutely there's overlap

2469
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,960
But there are things

2470
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,960
Like Simon's Quest

2471
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:52,960
Is on the NES Classic

2472
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,960
It is not on

2473
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,960
The Nintendo Switch thing

2474
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,960
The Nintendo Switch thing

2475
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,960
Has

2476
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,960
Um

2477
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,960
I don't believe

2478
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,960
Is on the NES Classic

2479
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,960
No I don't think so

2480
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,960
So

2481
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,960
You know

2482
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,960
There are games on the

2483
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,960
Swi-

2484
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,960
So it's not a hundred percent

2485
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:06,960
Overlap

2486
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,960
But the

2487
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,960
The first party stuff

2488
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:09,960
Is mostly overlap

2489
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:10,960
I think

2490
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,960
I don't think Ice Hockey

2491
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,960
Is on the

2492
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:13,960
NES Classic

2493
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:14,960
It is

2494
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,960
I only

2495
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,960
Impartial of that

2496
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:17,960
Because I actually

2497
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,960
Some of those black box games

2498
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,960
Man I could just do without

2499
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,960
Yeah

2500
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,960
I mean

2501
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:22,960
Sports ones

2502
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,960
Nah I know

2503
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:24,960
Forget that

2504
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,960
Alright

2505
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:26,960
You need Blades of Steel now

2506
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,960
I'm sorry

2507
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,960
To deviate the conversation

2508
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,960
But I thought that

2509
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,960
That hacking point

2510
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:31,960
Kind of opened the door

2511
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,960
To this other thing

2512
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:33,960
That was really important

2513
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,960
So talking about

2514
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,960
The Sony thing for a minute

2515
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:36,960
Where's your head at

2516
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,960
With this Loki

2517
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:38,960
Because for me

2518
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:39,960
I'm

2519
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:40,960
I'm kind of burned out

2520
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,960
On these classic things

2521
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:42,960
And this Sony thing

2522
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,960
I'm sorry

2523
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:44,960
This Sony thing

2524
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:45,960
Does not sound like

2525
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:46,960
It's worth

2526
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,960
The premium price

2527
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:48,960
They're charging for it

2528
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,960
Um

2529
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:50,960
I have to see

2530
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,960
What other games are in there

2531
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:52,960
I like

2532
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,960
The idea

2533
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:54,960
Of it

2534
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:55,960
Um

2535
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,960
I like

2536
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,960
The better idea

2537
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:58,960
Of hacking it apart

2538
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,960
Because

2539
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:00,960
You know the storage on that sucker

2540
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:01,960
Is going to be pretty big

2541
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:02,960
If it's got

2542
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:03,960
You know

2543
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:04,960
20 CD-ROM games in there

2544
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,960
I mean

2545
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:06,960
Especially when you're talking

2546
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:07,960
Final Fantasy 7

2547
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:08,960
Is three CD-ROMs

2548
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:09,960
Right

2549
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:10,960
Um

2550
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,960
And I think Wild Arms

2551
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,960
Is multiple as well

2552
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,960
So

2553
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,960
It'd be interesting to see

2554
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:15,960
How that works

2555
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,960
But

2556
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:17,960
See especially

2557
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:18,960
Like Final Fantasy 7

2558
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:19,960
There's a great title

2559
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:20,960
That I'm just

2560
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:21,960
I'm burned out on it now

2561
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,960
Yeah

2562
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,960
I don't really care about 7

2563
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,960
So much being on there

2564
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,960
I mean like

2565
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,120
It would be better though

2566
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,120
If it was just on the

2567
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,640
Goddamn PlayStation 4

2568
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,640
Thank you

2569
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,640
Is what it is

2570
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,640
Thank you

2571
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,640
And they sell them

2572
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,640
On the PlayStation 4

2573
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,640
It's like these remasters

2574
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,640
But

2575
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,640
So but

2576
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,640
By the way guys

2577
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,640
This thing

2578
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,640
With the classes

2579
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,640
This answers the question

2580
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,720
When will PlayStation 1 games

2581
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,280
Be playable on PlayStation 4

2582
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,280
Here's your answer

2583
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,280
Never

2584
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,280
This proves it

2585
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,280
Never

2586
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,280
This is not in Sony's plan

2587
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,280
To ever make those

2588
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,280
PlayStation 1 games

2589
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,280
That you just pop in your disc

2590
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,280
And play them on the PlayStation 4

2591
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,280
Nope

2592
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,280
So guys now showing them

2593
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,280
Hey you could charge them for it

2594
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,280
All over again

2595
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,280
And get away with it

2596
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,280
And now they're gonna do it

2597
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,280
And

2598
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,280
But for me honestly

2599
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,280
Again

2600
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,280
They're charging a premium price

2601
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,280
For this compared to Nintendo

2602
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,960
I realize it's a more advanced console

2603
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,960
But it's

2604
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,080
It's over 20 years old

2605
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,280
None of it is that advanced anymore

2606
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,880
They're charging a hundred bucks for it

2607
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:12,960
And they are shorting you

2608
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,840
With the power cord

2609
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,840
Which I understand

2610
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,440
Like 3DS's don't come with chargers

2611
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,440
But this is

2612
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,520
This is a different conversation

2613
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,520
With these classics

2614
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,520
Because what

2615
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,520
It's USB power

2616
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,520
So they

2617
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,760
They plug it into your TV

2618
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:25,760
That's USB powered or something

2619
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,760
I don't know

2620
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,760
Eh

2621
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,760
So or you have a charger

2622
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,760
Or buy a Sony charger

2623
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,760
Uh

2624
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:31,760
So for whatever reason

2625
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,760
They're skimming on that

2626
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,040
My biggest thing that surprises me

2627
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,680
Is the lack of DualShock

2628
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,680
That

2629
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,040
When Sony got the DualShock

2630
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,080
Was when the PlayStation

2631
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,080
Really start to

2632
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,080
Took off

2633
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,080
Take off

2634
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,080
Because I don't know

2635
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,080
If you guys remember

2636
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,080
The PlayStation at first

2637
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,360
Did not take off

2638
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,360
The way that it did

2639
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,360
A couple

2640
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,360
Like remember when the PlayStation games

2641
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,520
Were in those big ol' boxes

2642
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,520
That's when they

2643
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,520
The first came out

2644
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,520
The PlayStation games

2645
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,520
Were in those big ol' boxes

2646
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,520
It wasn't until like

2647
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,520
A year or two later

2648
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,520
When DualShock came out

2649
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,520
They kind of soft relaunched

2650
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,520
The system

2651
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,520
With some of the games

2652
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,520
That they had then

2653
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,520
And then they started

2654
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,520
They scaled it down

2655
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,520
To the CD size stuff

2656
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,520
And you know

2657
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,520
It started selling a lot better

2658
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,520
So it's really weird to me

2659
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,520
That this mini system

2660
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,520
Represents that earlier era

2661
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,520
Of PlayStation

2662
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,520
Even though it's in the mini form

2663
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,520
Uh

2664
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,520
And not the later era

2665
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,520
Of PlayStation

2666
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,520
It's just kind of weird to me

2667
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,520
So

2668
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,520
Yeah

2669
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,520
I don't know

2670
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,520
I'm curious

2671
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,520
I don't know

2672
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,520
I

2673
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,520
Kaijuto says

2674
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,520
No I don't want that shit

2675
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,520
On my PlayStation 4

2676
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,520
Well

2677
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,520
Okay

2678
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,520
But some of us do

2679
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,520
I still enjoy playing retro classics

2680
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,520
They have like PlayStation

2681
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,520
I have a copy of Tekken 3

2682
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,520
Like

2683
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,520
I have some of the old

2684
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,520
Like PlayStation 2 games

2685
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,520
That they've remastered

2686
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,520
Or whatever

2687
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,520
Like they have

2688
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,520
Uh

2689
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,520
Like the Warriors for example

2690
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,520
Or

2691
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,520
But at least they remastered those

2692
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,520
At least they remastered those

2693
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,520
Well

2694
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,520
I mean

2695
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,520
I still have my Blamecast

2696
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,520
It would be nice

2697
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,520
To be able to just pop in the PS1 disc

2698
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,520
Like I did on the PlayStation 3

2699
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,520
That kind of set that expectation

2700
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,520
If you're wondering like

2701
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,520
Why am I holding Sony accountable to this

2702
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,520
Because you could do it on the PlayStation 3

2703
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,520
And so it feels like it's a little bit of a step backwards

2704
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,520
And

2705
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,520
Let's not forget

2706
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:09,520
Microsoft is sitting over here

2707
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,520
Trying to work

2708
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,520
To make original Xbox games playable

2709
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,520
On Xbox One

2710
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,520
Well here's the other funnier thing too

2711
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,520
When you think about this too

2712
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,520
Like

2713
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,520
And I saw the comparisons almost immediately

2714
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,520
When the PlayStation Classic came out

2715
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,520
They're like

2716
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,520
PlayStation Classic

2717
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,520
Can play all these PlayStation 1 games

2718
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,520
Or you could get a PlayStation TV

2719
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,520
For like 30 bucks

2720
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,520
Have DualShock support

2721
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,520
And it could also play PlayStation 1 games

2722
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,520
And Vita games

2723
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,520
And whatever else that you want to throw on there

2724
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,520
I mean

2725
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,520
That's the other rub too

2726
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,520
Is like

2727
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,520
Well you could have supported that system

2728
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,520
And it could have done all this shit as well

2729
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,520
And it didn't cost as much

2730
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,520
Bobby Blackwolf in chat is asking

2731
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,520
So in 20 years what will be on the PlayStation 4 Classic?

2732
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,520
Uh

2733
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,520
Horizon Zero Dawn

2734
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,520
Last Guardian

2735
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,520
Um

2736
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,520
Probably like a lot of the first party Sony stuff

2737
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,520
Spider-Man

2738
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,520
Oh sure

2739
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,520
Oh yeah the Spider-Man game

2740
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,520
Infamous

2741
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,520
Uh

2742
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,520
The Last of Us remastered

2743
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,520
Definitive Edition

2744
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,520
Whatever it is

2745
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,520
Last of Us 2 inevitably will be something that would probably be on there too

2746
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,520
Or the PlayStation 3 Classic

2747
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,520
Which will not have Rumble either

2748
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,520
Because it's gonna just be 6X's

2749
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,520
It's not gonna be before they have the DualShock 3

2750
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,520
You know back when they were like

2751
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,520
You don't need Rumble

2752
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,520
We didn't pay the license ad again

2753
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,520
But you don't need it

2754
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,520
Alright well speaking of classics

2755
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,520
I know this is one that folks here at Orange Lounge Radio can get behind

2756
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,520
Did you know

2757
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:32,520
Dance Dance Revolution's 20th anniversary is this week

2758
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,520
In fact in two days

2759
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,520
Konami is scheduled to make some sort of announcement

2760
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,520
Uh

2761
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,520
To celebrate

2762
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:40,520
Please don't suck

2763
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,520
20th anniversary

2764
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,520
Could that be a new home version?

2765
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,520
Or is it more likely a new release in arcades

2766
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,520
I think maybe a new release in arcades

2767
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,520
Maybe

2768
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,520
Hopefully not a mobile game

2769
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,520
But like you know

2770
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,520
Oh god

2771
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,520
Not a mobile game

2772
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,520
Shake out

2773
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,520
I hope it's a new game

2774
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,520
It's been a couple years since Ace

2775
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,520
Yeah it's been a couple years since Ace

2776
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,520
Although I thought Ace was supposed to be the game that's like forever expandable

2777
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,520
But maybe you know maybe they'll

2778
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,520
Yeah well so are like all the other like

2779
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,520
Beatmania games

2780
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,520
I know

2781
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,520
So what would DDR be

2782
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,520
Will be the big 20th anniversary

2783
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,520
No they'll go with some stupid naming convention like they have with 2DX

2784
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,520
Like it's just

2785
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,520
Call whatever they want

2786
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,520
Whatever the fuck they want to call it

2787
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,520
20

2788
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,520
DDR20

2789
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,520
Yeah pumpkin spice

2790
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,520
Pumpkin spice mix

2791
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,520
I like that

2792
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:28,520
You know I'd be down for that

2793
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,520
Dark Tetsuya thinks

2794
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,520
I'm thinking DDRXX

2795
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,520
No too many people

2796
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,520
Especially

2797
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,520
They are gonna be thinking about America at least a little bit

2798
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,520
And they know that DDRXX

2799
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,520
Is too close to DDRXX

2800
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,520
Which is gonna have a very different type of connotation

2801
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,520
No I would

2802
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,520
I would hope something that

2803
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,520
I don't know

2804
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,520
I just hope it's not lame

2805
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,520
Maybe DDRXX or something

2806
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,520
I don't know

2807
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,520
But I thought about

2808
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,520
Well and X is too confusing too

2809
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,520
Cause X is it's own series so

2810
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,520
True

2811
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,520
And so they can't really

2812
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,520
And they already have an X2

2813
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,520
That's true

2814
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,520
So they can't really do that

2815
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,520
I mean

2816
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,520
Let's just go max 3

2817
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,520
That's just extreme

2818
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,520
They already extreme too

2819
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:07,520
DDR20th mix

2820
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,520
Just call it that

2821
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,520
20th anniversary yeah

2822
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:10,520
Well I mean

2823
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,520
It's

2824
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,520
Isn't it weird to think though

2825
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:15,520
DDR is 20 years old

2826
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,520
And we were kind of there at the beginning-ish

2827
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,520
I mean

2828
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,520
What this show

2829
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,520
OLR started

2830
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,520
4 years into that right

2831
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,520
Cause we started 2002

2832
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,520
And I think most of us were playing DDR first in 2001

2833
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,520
If not sooner

2834
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,520
Like Jamie was probably there in 99

2835
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,520
I remember seeing it in 2000

2836
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,520
Well I had my

2837
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,520
My birthday

2838
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,520
I got my second mix

2839
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,520
For Dreamcast

2840
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,520
But yeah I think I was playing

2841
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,520
I wanna say around 2000

2842
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,520
Cause we had found

2843
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,520
Where did we find that machine?

2844
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,520
It wasn't at Golfland

2845
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,520
It was

2846
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,520
We all met in 2000

2847
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,520
You were playing before then

2848
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,520
Cause we all met in 2000

2849
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,520
Cause that was

2850
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,520
I played at Anime Expo

2851
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,520
Yeah

2852
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,520
That was the year I lived at Melrose Place

2853
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,520
It was 2000

2854
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,520
January 2000

2855
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,520
Yeah

2856
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,520
At Anime Expo Disneyland

2857
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,520
And they had a third mix there

2858
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,520
And they told me how to do Vivid

2859
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:11,520
And I was singing along with Xanadu

2860
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,520
You know

2861
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,520
And like

2862
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,520
I thought you never played before

2863
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,520
People would say

2864
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,520
And be like

2865
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,520
But I've seen Xanadu 57 million times

2866
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,520
It's Olivia Newton-John

2867
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,520
Olivia Newton-John people

2868
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,520
Is that why it's called the Olivia Pro-

2869
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:23,520
No shit

2870
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,520
As the same Anime Expo where

2871
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,520
The Chair

2872
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,520
The Chair was a character of that Anime Expo

2873
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,520
I wasn't

2874
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,520
I wasn't around for this

2875
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,520
The Chair

2876
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:35,520
The Chair

2877
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,520
I've never been to Anime Expo

2878
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,520
And I plan to keep it that way

2879
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,520
I have a picture of Chair

2880
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,520
On the DDR machine

2881
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,520
Okay

2882
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,520
This was yeah

2883
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,520
This was the one time it was the Disneyland hotel

2884
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,520
And the cosplayers kept getting kicked out of the park

2885
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,520
Oh I heard about all that fuckery

2886
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,520
It's the reason why they didn't do it there again since

2887
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,520
Alright anyway

2888
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,520
SD200Matt talking about DDR20 in our chat saying

2889
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:53,520
So a few months ago

2890
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,520
The top DDR players took to Twitter

2891
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,520
To ask Konami

2892
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,520
Make things better with DDR with a number

2893
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,520
I don't remember what it was

2894
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,520
Konami actually responded to them

2895
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,520
And said

2896
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,520
We hear you and we have big things in the works

2897
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,520
And then we got

2898
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:07,520
Dancing Sta-

2899
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,520
Or what was the

2900
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,520
Dance Fl-

2901
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,520
What the fuck's that new one

2902
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,520
That everybody's losing their shit about

2903
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,520
Dance Rush

2904
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:13,520
Which I still haven't played

2905
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,520
No me neither

2906
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,520
Wah

2907
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,520
That's what I should have done this weekend

2908
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,520
Taken an impromptu trip to round one to play that

2909
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,520
Cause I still haven't played it

2910
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,520
Well

2911
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,520
I can't wait for my fat old ass to get on that machine

2912
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,520
Wait so long enough it'll be down here

2913
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:25,520
Yeah it's true

2914
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,520
It's true if I wait long enough

2915
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,520
Alright

2916
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,520
Anyway

2917
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:30,520
Alright

2918
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:31,520
Let's move on

2919
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,520
To our Sakura

2920
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,520
I mean god we've had all this news but

2921
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,520
There was like a pretty big event going on

2922
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,520
Across the ocean right

2923
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,520
Yeah there was

2924
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,520
And so I thought I would just go with

2925
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:41,520
Some of the best

2926
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:44,520
Ranked stuff that came out of Tokyo Game Show

2927
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,520
And if any of this is

2928
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,520
Comes up later on in the show

2929
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,520
I'm not trying to step on any toes

2930
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,520
I'm not gonna go into any

2931
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,520
Type of detail about this

2932
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,520
But I will just make the announcements

2933
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,520
If that's cool with everybody

2934
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,520
So Ace Combat 7 Skies Unknown

2935
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,520
Is on the list

2936
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,520
And it looks like it's got VR support

2937
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,520
There also is going to be

2938
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,520
Another Catherine game

2939
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,520
Catherine Full Body

2940
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,520
For PS4 and Vita

2941
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,520
You know it's funny

2942
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,520
I actually read the Catherine novels

2943
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,520
Very interesting

2944
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:19,520
I'll just leave it there

2945
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,520
Also coming out is

2946
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,520
Days Gone for PS4

2947
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,520
But there was

2948
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,520
A motorcycle to advertise it

2949
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,520
Also

2950
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,520
Looks like we have

2951
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,520
Dead or Alive 6

2952
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,520
And it looks very pretty with

2953
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,520
Blood splatter for every punch

2954
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,520
We also have

2955
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,520
I'm waiting for some of these to load

2956
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,520
Of course there's Death Stranding

2957
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:49,520
So hopefully we'll know

2958
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,520
More about this

2959
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,520
Maybe

2960
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,520
So you know what we saw

2961
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,520
There was a trailer

2962
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,520
With a dude in a golden mask

2963
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:57,520
And it was revealed that

2964
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,520
That guy was Troy Baker

2965
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,520
And again

2966
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:02,520
This game is very like

2967
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:03,520
That's all I need to know

2968
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,520
What is it?

2969
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,520
What is this game?

2970
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,520
There is a guy in like

2971
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,520
Diving gear

2972
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,520
Under water

2973
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,520
But his gear is off

2974
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,520
His face is

2975
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,520
His mask is off

2976
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,520
So whatever that is

2977
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:19,520
So

2978
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,520
God why is it taking so long to load

2979
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,520
I'm sorry about this guys

2980
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,520
There we go

2981
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,520
So

2982
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:29,520
Devil May Cry 5

2983
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,520
Which

2984
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,520
Yay

2985
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,520
There'll be a little bit more about that

2986
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,520
Coming up I know for sure

2987
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,520
At least coming from the director

2988
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,520
Of Devil May Cry 5

2989
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,520
And then

2990
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,520
Next up

2991
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,520
Gosh I'm so sorry this is taking so long

2992
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,520
Man Dead or Alive 6 looks awesome

2993
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,520
Dragon Quest Builders 2

2994
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,520
We knew that was coming

2995
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,520
But we just haven't really

2996
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,520
Seen the game itself yet

2997
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:56,520
I don't believe

2998
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,520
So

2999
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,520
Or did

3000
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,520
Did 1 and 2 never

3001
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,520
I thought they were gonna get

3002
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,520
A combo package on the Switch

3003
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,520
Did that never happen?

3004
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:04,520
I don't think so

3005
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,520
Oh alright

3006
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,520
I guess I thought that would've

3007
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,520
Happened a long time ago

3008
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,520
There's another game

3009
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,520
Um

3010
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,520
Coming up by Inti Creates

3011
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,520
Um

3012
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,520
But they did a game

3013
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,520
Um

3014
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,520
Called Dragon March for Death

3015
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:18,520
This is the same studio that did

3016
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,520
Mega Man Zero

3017
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:21,520
Um

3018
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,520
The art style looks really nice

3019
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,520
There's also everybody's golf VR

3020
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:25,520
Whatever it's golf

3021
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:27,520
Uh

3022
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,520
Fortnite was at Tokyo Game Show

3023
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,520
That's interesting

3024
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,520
Yeah

3025
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,520
But it looks like people were

3026
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,520
Playing the shit off of it

3027
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:35,520
Is it though? Because

3028
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,520
If it was

3029
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:37,520
Was it

3030
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,520
At Sony's booth because

3031
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:39,520
You know that is the best console

3032
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,520
To play it on according to Sony

3033
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,520
Well no I'm more saying the fact that like

3034
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,520
It feels like everywhere you go here

3035
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:46,520
People are playing Fortnite

3036
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:47,520
And people know of Fortnite

3037
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,520
So it's interesting that Japan

3038
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,520
I don't know if it's

3039
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,520
That big

3040
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:51,520
But it's still

3041
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,520
Big enough

3042
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,520
There's a

3043
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,520
Yakuza game called

3044
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,520
Judge Eyes coming out

3045
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,520
Um

3046
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,520
It looks interesting

3047
01:06:58,520 --> 01:06:59,520
There's also

3048
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,520
Kingdom Hearts 3

3049
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:01,520
Um

3050
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,520
Mega Man 11

3051
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:03,520
For PS4

3052
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,520
Xbox One

3053
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,520
We're getting a new

3054
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,520
Kingdom Hearts game?

3055
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,520
Eventually

3056
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,520
Well they showed off

3057
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:09,520
It was a trailer with

3058
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,520
Big Hero 6

3059
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:11,520
So that's kind of cool

3060
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,520
Yeah no the new footage was cool

3061
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,520
There's another game called

3062
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:14,520
Ninjala

3063
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:15,520
That's um

3064
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,520
Kind of

3065
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:17,520
Splatoon-ish

3066
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:18,520
From what it looks like

3067
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,520
But definitely different

3068
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,520
Mechanics for PVP

3069
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,520
Um

3070
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,520
I'm almost to the list

3071
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,520
Let's see

3072
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,520
That looks like arms

3073
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:29,520
Uh

3074
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,520
Persona Q2 Full Cinema Labyrinth

3075
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,520
Um

3076
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,520
It looks

3077
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,520
Interesting for its style

3078
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,520
But definitely has the same

3079
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,520
Dungeon crawling elements in it

3080
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,520
Um

3081
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:43,520
There's also

3082
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,520
Resident Evil 2 remake

3083
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,520
Which I am super excited about

3084
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,520
Because

3085
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,520
Hello they should have

3086
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:50,520
Remade this a long time ago

3087
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,520
Um

3088
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,520
There's Tetris Effect for PS4 and PSVR

3089
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:58,520
So it looks like it's Tetris with

3090
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,520
A musical element

3091
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:01,520
It's amazing

3092
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,520
It's fucking

3093
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:03,520
They showed this at E3

3094
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,520
It's the rez guy

3095
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,520
It's Mizuguchi doing Tetris

3096
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,520
It looks fucking amazing

3097
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,520
And then there's Warriors Orochi 4

3098
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,520
Um

3099
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,520
You know which is

3100
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:14,520
Just those usual

3101
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:15,520
Warriors game

3102
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,520
Um

3103
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,520
But it's actually

3104
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,520
Um

3105
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,520
Over there

3106
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,520
It's actually Orochi Musou 3 in Japan

3107
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,520
But we got it

3108
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,520
As Warriors Orochi 4

3109
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,520
Here in the US

3110
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,520
Um

3111
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:29,520
And then that's it

3112
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,520
So those are things coming

3113
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:33,520
The biggest hype coming out of Tokyo Game Show

3114
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,520
I'd still like to go to Tokyo Game Show

3115
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:35,520
One day

3116
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,520
One day

3117
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,520
One day

3118
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,520
I know

3119
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,520
My check will come

3120
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,520
I know

3121
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:41,520
One day I'll have money

3122
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,520
Alright

3123
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,520
Let's move on

3124
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,520
Loki

3125
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,520
Maybe some not so great news

3126
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,520
Coming out of Tokyo Game Show

3127
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,520
Right

3128
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:48,520
Yeah

3129
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,520
So

3130
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,520
Um

3131
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,520
Unfortunately

3132
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,520
The uh

3133
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,520
Lack of Sony being into the Vita

3134
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,520
Is finally caught up with the Vita

3135
01:08:58,520 --> 01:08:59,520
In Japan

3136
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,520
Because remember

3137
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:01,520
Japan is doing pretty good over there

3138
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,520
But now

3139
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:03,520
The Vita's dead

3140
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,520
And

3141
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,520
Unfortunately

3142
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,520
Sony doesn't have

3143
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:07,520
Anything coming out

3144
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,520
That's been announced

3145
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,520
As a successor for the Vita

3146
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,520
Um

3147
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:12,520
But yeah

3148
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,520
Basically

3149
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,520
As for portable gaming machine

3150
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,520
There are no plans for anything

3151
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:16,520
After the Vita

3152
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:17,520
Um

3153
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,520
And right now

3154
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,520
That there's no

3155
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,520
Yeah

3156
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,520
Hardware successor

3157
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,520
That they're working on

3158
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,520
So

3159
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,520
That's unfortunate

3160
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,520
Too bad

3161
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,520
I'm surprised with the Switch being so

3162
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,520
Powerful and everything

3163
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,520
That

3164
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:29,520
They might reconsider

3165
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,520
Since you know

3166
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:31,520
They like copying Nintendo obviously

3167
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,520
With

3168
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:33,520
Everything that they do

3169
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,520
Yeah

3170
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:35,520
I um

3171
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,520
I mean I don't know

3172
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:37,520
I am and I'm not surprised

3173
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,520
To hear this

3174
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,520
About the Vita

3175
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,520
Like I still thought the Vita

3176
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,520
Had anything to do

3177
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,520
With the Vita

3178
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,520
But

3179
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,520
Yeah

3180
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,520
I still thought the Vita

3181
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,520
Had

3182
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,520
A lot of life span

3183
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,520
Going for it

3184
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,520
In Japan

3185
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,520
You know

3186
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,520
I feel like when we do the Japanese releases

3187
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,520
We're still having quite frequently

3188
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,520
Japanese releases on the Vita

3189
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:55,520
So

3190
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,520
I thought for that

3191
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:57,520
You know

3192
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,520
Purpose

3193
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,520
There would still be

3194
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,520
You know

3195
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:01,520
Some sort of official support

3196
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:02,520
From Sony

3197
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:03,520
Because Sony

3198
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,520
Those games don't have to stop coming out

3199
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:05,520
This is the Vita

3200
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,520
I'm not quite dead

3201
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,520
I think I'll go for

3202
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,520
Well just because

3203
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,520
Yes

3204
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,520
But Sony's like

3205
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:11,520
No you're dead

3206
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:12,520
You know

3207
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:13,520
Just because Sony

3208
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,520
They might as well

3209
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:15,520
You know

3210
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,520
It's kind of

3211
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,520
Once the company's kind of

3212
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,520
Officially stopped

3213
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:19,520
I mean

3214
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,520
I get it

3215
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,520
There's still people making games

3216
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,520
To the Dreamcast

3217
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:23,520
But

3218
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,520
A lot of the

3219
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:25,520
You know

3220
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,520
You realize these are different things

3221
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,520
I feel happy

3222
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:28,520
Those sorts of pet projects

3223
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:29,520
Are very different from

3224
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,520
You know

3225
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,520
The

3226
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,520
Weekly releases

3227
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,520
And all that stuff

3228
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,520
So

3229
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,520
I mean

3230
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,520
As far as the US is concerned

3231
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,520
I'm not surprised at all

3232
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,520
To hear this

3233
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,520
The Vita's been effectively dead here

3234
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,520
For some time

3235
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:41,520
Yeah

3236
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,520
But it's

3237
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,520
But I

3238
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,520
To be honest

3239
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,520
I don't want Sony

3240
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:47,520
Doing another portable system

3241
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,520
If they're gonna treat it

3242
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,520
Like they did that one

3243
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,520
Why should Sony do

3244
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,520
Another portable system

3245
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,520
If they're just gonna turn

3246
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,520
Their back on it

3247
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,520
So quickly

3248
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,520
Like they did the last one

3249
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,520
Like

3250
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,520
I think it's for the best

3251
01:10:58,520 --> 01:10:59,520
They don't

3252
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:00,520
Do another system

3253
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,520
Anyway

3254
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,520
Uh

3255
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,520
Kaijuto says

3256
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:07,520
No no

3257
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:08,520
This is different

3258
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,520
This is not talk about

3259
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,520
How it feels

3260
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:11,520
Dead in the US

3261
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,520
This is Sony saying

3262
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,520
We are pulling the plug

3263
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,520
In 2019

3264
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,520
So

3265
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,520
This is much different

3266
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,520
Than what usually comes up

3267
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,520
Deft says

3268
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:23,520
Vita means life

3269
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,520
Well

3270
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:25,520
Now your Vita

3271
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,520
Is a

3272
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,520
Huerta?

3273
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,520
I don't know what to

3274
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,520
Say

3275
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,520
Alright

3276
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,520
Uh

3277
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:33,520
Let's move on

3278
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:34,520
And talk about

3279
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:35,520
I kind of referred to this

3280
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,520
Already earlier

3281
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:37,520
So I kind of repeating myself

3282
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,520
A little bit

3283
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:39,520
Sorry

3284
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,520
But I just couldn't help

3285
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,520
The servers did indeed

3286
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,520
Already breach Nintendo's

3287
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:43,520
Online system

3288
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,520
So what happened is

3289
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:46,520
That they were uploading

3290
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:47,520
New NES ROMs

3291
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,520
Into the library

3292
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,520
Essentially

3293
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,520
Uh

3294
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,520
What they

3295
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,520
I don't understand

3296
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,520
All the inner workings

3297
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,520
Of how this works

3298
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:55,520
Maybe Loki you know more

3299
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,520
About this stuff than I do

3300
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:57,520
All I know is I saw the receipts

3301
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,520
Somebody posted a video

3302
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,520
Yeah

3303
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,520
And they fired up a game

3304
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,520
And it was not the game

3305
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,520
That was

3306
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:03,520
It was not River City Ransom

3307
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,520
It was Kirby

3308
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,520
So they

3309
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,520
They were able to

3310
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:07,520
Like swap out

3311
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,520
One NES file for another

3312
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:09,520
Yeah basically

3313
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:10,520
They were stored as plain

3314
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,520
NES ROMs

3315
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,520
So it's just

3316
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:13,520
The normal

3317
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,520
ROM file for

3318
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:17,520
Um

3319
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,520
For an NES cartridge

3320
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:19,520
So like they have

3321
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,520
Battletoads

3322
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,520
Is one that

3323
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:22,520
They had a video of

3324
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:23,520
That they took

3325
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,520
Oh yeah I saw the

3326
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:25,520
Battletoads one too

3327
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,520
So you know

3328
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:27,520
And as we got into

3329
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:28,520
A little bit earlier

3330
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,520
So not to repeat

3331
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,520
Ourselves too bad

3332
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,520
But basically you know

3333
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,520
This does prove that

3334
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,520
Nintendo

3335
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,520
Has done all this work

3336
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:35,520
On the emulator

3337
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,520
To be able to do

3338
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,520
The online games

3339
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,520
And all that

3340
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,520
And release all of their

3341
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,520
Games right now

3342
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:41,520
If they wanted to

3343
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,520
They have chosen not to

3344
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,520
For whatever

3345
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,520
Yeah but I don't know

3346
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,520
Like obviously we haven't seen

3347
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,520
This like play

3348
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:47,520
In online or something

3349
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,520
Like that

3350
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,520
Like with other people

3351
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,520
I would assume that

3352
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,520
It's all emulator based

3353
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,520
So but

3354
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:53,520
Um

3355
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,520
You know

3356
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:55,520
They could use that

3357
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,520
As the excuse of

3358
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:57,520
Well these games

3359
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:58,520
Need to be changed

3360
01:12:58,520 --> 01:12:59,520
For

3361
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,520
I don't think so though

3362
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:01,520
It's just

3363
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,520
It's just they're not

3364
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,520
Well also with the

3365
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,520
Nintendo online

3366
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:05,520
You know there's

3367
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,520
Different filters

3368
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,520
And different modes

3369
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,520
And filters you can use

3370
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,520
As CRT

3371
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,520
Where you can kind of

3372
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:11,520
Purposely make your screen

3373
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,520
Look dirty

3374
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:13,520
Like an old television

3375
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,520
Would have looked

3376
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,520
Which you know

3377
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,520
Or if you have kids

3378
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,520
You don't have to do that

3379
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,520
At all

3380
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,520
It's naturally dirty

3381
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,520
If you want the authentic

3382
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,520
Look or whatever

3383
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,520
I guess you could go for that

3384
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:23,520
Filters can be fun

3385
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:24,520
But some people saying

3386
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:25,520
Taking to social media

3387
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:26,520
Saying

3388
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:27,520
The CRT TV

3389
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,520
Is causing

3390
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:29,520
Burn in

3391
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,520
On my

3392
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:31,520
Or at least something

3393
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,520
That kind of looks like it

3394
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:33,520
This went up to Reddit

3395
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,520
And basically said

3396
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:35,520
Some NES games

3397
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:36,520
There's discoloration

3398
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:37,520
On the Switch screen

3399
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:38,520
After this

3400
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,520
So

3401
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:40,520
They did

3402
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:41,520
They posted all this stuff

3403
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,520
But

3404
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:43,520
Apparently

3405
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,520
It's a rendering issue

3406
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:45,520
And not actually

3407
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,520
Any type of burn in

3408
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,520
It's not

3409
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:48,520
It's just a rendering thing

3410
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:49,520
It's displaying

3411
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,520
The

3412
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:51,520
The

3413
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:52,520
Stuff on the menu

3414
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:53,520
Kind of like it's

3415
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,520
Bleeding through

3416
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,520
From the rendering

3417
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,520
Of the NES game

3418
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,520
Or something like that

3419
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,520
Nintendo did not officially

3420
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,520
Comment on all this stuff

3421
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:00,520
But it doesn't sound like

3422
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,520
It's as bad

3423
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,520
As the internet

3424
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:03,520
Was making it out to be

3425
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,520
Because that's never

3426
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,520
Happened before

3427
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,520
But also

3428
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:07,520
Eh

3429
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,520
Don't use that CRT filter

3430
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,520
Well that

3431
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:11,520
And also like

3432
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:12,520
I just

3433
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:13,520
Eh

3434
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,520
I would

3435
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:15,520
Oh

3436
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,520
Minimal viable product

3437
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,520
Is a phrase I like to use

3438
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,520
You know

3439
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,520
At work

3440
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,520
And with a lot of things

3441
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:22,520
And

3442
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:23,520
So for as long as this

3443
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:24,520
Took to happen

3444
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,520
There's still weird shit

3445
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,520
Like this out there

3446
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:27,520
Yeah it's just like that

3447
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,520
You know

3448
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:29,520
They used the same damn

3449
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:32,520
Emulator that they made for

3450
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:33,520
The NES Classic and stuff

3451
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:34,520
I'm not gonna complain

3452
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:35,520
That they were giving us

3453
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:36,520
Online play for free

3454
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,520
All this extra time

3455
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,520
Since Nintendo Online

3456
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,520
Real

3457
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,520
Really the NES classes

3458
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,520
Is really the only new thing

3459
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,520
At least it feels like anyway

3460
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,520
That we're getting with them

3461
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,520
But it does feel pathetic

3462
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,520
Though that they can't even

3463
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,520
Get that to run correctly

3464
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:49,520
I mean they shouldn't even

3465
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,520
Have a mode that

3466
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,520
Toggle low latency

3467
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,520
You should just

3468
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,520
Be on

3469
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,520
If that's what it takes

3470
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:55,520
To run

3471
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,520
Like I don't even understand

3472
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,520
The problem is

3473
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,520
And not just a knock

3474
01:14:58,520 --> 01:14:59,520
Um

3475
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:00,520
I do

3476
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:01,520
I do want to stress though

3477
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:02,520
Our situation with him

3478
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:03,520
Streaming in my

3479
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:04,520
But not even necessarily

3480
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:05,520
Just this

3481
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:06,520
Like the Capcom

3482
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:07,520
Arcade collection

3483
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:08,520
That just came out

3484
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,520
That beat him up one

3485
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,520
Is fucked

3486
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:11,520
When it comes to

3487
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,520
Online mode

3488
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,520
And the Switch as well

3489
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:15,520
And they have like

3490
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:16,520
Lag issues like

3491
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:17,520
It's just like

3492
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,520
It's stuttery

3493
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,520
It's so bad

3494
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,520
But that's just

3495
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,520
Another issue

3496
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,520
It's like

3497
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:23,520
Come on you guys

3498
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,520
You know that this

3499
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,520
Probably exists

3500
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,520
Why

3501
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:27,520
Why not

3502
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,520
Hold it off

3503
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:29,520
A little bit longer

3504
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,520
Alright

3505
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:32,520
Let's move on

3506
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:33,520
We have a few more

3507
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,520
Stories to get to

3508
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:35,520
Uh

3509
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:36,520
Darcyra

3510
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:37,520
Well

3511
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:38,520
As I might have teased

3512
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:39,520
Earlier

3513
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,520
There was

3514
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:41,520
Uh

3515
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:42,520
Something from

3516
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:43,520
The Devil May Cry director

3517
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,520
And this is not

3518
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:45,520
Quite what people

3519
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,520
Think it is

3520
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,520
Um

3521
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,520
Uh

3522
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:49,520
There was

3523
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:50,520
Um

3524
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,520
An interview

3525
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:52,520
With him

3526
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,520
Very recently

3527
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,520
Um

3528
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:55,520
Uh

3529
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,520
It's no

3530
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,520
Hideaki

3531
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,520
And he was asked

3532
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,520
The question

3533
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:00,520
If he would like

3534
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,520
To

3535
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:03,520
And I'm just gonna

3536
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:04,520
Read his whole

3537
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,520
Response here

3538
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,520
If I was allowed

3539
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,520
I'd love to remake

3540
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,520
Love to make

3541
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,520
Rival Schools 3

3542
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,520
I'd love to make

3543
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:11,520
Dragon's Dogma 2

3544
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,520
Capcom vs. SNK 3

3545
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:13,520
Street Fighter Alpha 4

3546
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:14,520
Power Stone 3

3547
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:15,520
And if I could

3548
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,520
Even Street Fighter 6

3549
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:17,520
Would be amazing

3550
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,520
But the big one

3551
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,520
The one that we'd need

3552
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,520
To get resolution on

3553
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,520
Is Rival Schools

3554
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,520
Because in Japan

3555
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,520
There are three years

3556
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,520
Of high school

3557
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:25,520
We've seen the first

3558
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:26,520
Two years for these kids

3559
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:27,520
So the third one

3560
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:28,520
Would be their last year

3561
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:29,520
In high school

3562
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,520
Wouldn't that be cool

3563
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,520
Yes

3564
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,520
Please make this happen

3565
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:36,520
I'm going to find his Twitter

3566
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:37,520
And I'm going to post

3567
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:38,520
Every day Rival Schools 3

3568
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,520
Rival Schools 3

3569
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,520
Hashtag

3570
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,520
Hashtag

3571
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,520
Hashtag

3572
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:43,520
Um

3573
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,520
So

3574
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,520
We need to get on this people

3575
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,520
We made President Kat happen

3576
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,520
Ha ha ha ha

3577
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,520
Or we didn't make it happen

3578
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,520
It never did come out in the US

3579
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:56,520
Still

3580
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,520
We encouraged them

3581
01:16:58,520 --> 01:16:59,520
And

3582
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,520
If some sites are to be believed

3583
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:02,520
It was like the worst selling Wii game

3584
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,520
Of all time

3585
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,520
So I'm not sure we actually

3586
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,520
Made anything happen there

3587
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,520
Dr. Sakura

3588
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:07,520
Ha ha ha

3589
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:08,520
It was just too

3590
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:09,520
Too early

3591
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:10,520
I know

3592
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:11,520
It was ahead of its time

3593
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:12,520
Yeah we were just extremely hipster

3594
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:13,520
That's all

3595
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,520
Because now we have

3596
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,520
You know other

3597
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:16,520
Cat centered games

3598
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:17,520
Like cat lateral damage

3599
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,520
And stuff like that

3600
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:19,520
Yeah

3601
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,520
Can't tell me something

3602
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:21,520
Cat based

3603
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,520
Won't sell well

3604
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:23,520
In this type of internet

3605
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:24,520
Ha ha

3606
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,520
See if we brought it out

3607
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:26,520
Over here

3608
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,520
It would be

3609
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:28,520
Asshole CEO

3610
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,520
All right

3611
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,520
Let's move on

3612
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,520
Loki

3613
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,520
So YouTube is closing

3614
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:35,520
YouTube gaming

3615
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,520
Because

3616
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:38,520
Nobody likes to use the app

3617
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,520
And

3618
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,520
That's unfortunate

3619
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:41,520
But

3620
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,520
It's not

3621
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:43,520
Entirely bad

3622
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,520
So basically what they're doing

3623
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,520
Is they're getting rid of

3624
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:46,520
The dedicated app

3625
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,520
For YouTube gaming

3626
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,520
Because once again

3627
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,520
A lot of people are just using

3628
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:50,520
The main YouTube app

3629
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:52,520
To watch YouTube gaming content

3630
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,520
Instead

3631
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,520
If you still want to

3632
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:55,520
You know

3633
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,520
Interested in just

3634
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:57,520
The gaming content

3635
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:58,520
For one

3636
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,520
It kind of

3637
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:00,520
Focused like that

3638
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:01,520
You can go to

3639
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,520
YouTube slash gaming

3640
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:03,520
And it will show you

3641
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,520
The same damn shit

3642
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:05,520
So

3643
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,520
And they kind of

3644
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:07,520
Kind of set up

3645
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,520
A little bit like

3646
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:09,520
Twitch as well

3647
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:10,520
When you look at it

3648
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,520
That way

3649
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,520
With all your

3650
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:13,520
You know

3651
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,520
Top live games

3652
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,520
Live streamers

3653
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,520
Gaming videos

3654
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:18,520
From your subscriptions

3655
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,520
That type of stuff

3656
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:21,520
You know

3657
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,520
I don't know

3658
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:23,520
Like I think

3659
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,520
With YouTube gaming

3660
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:25,520
Like it was hard

3661
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,520
Most people didn't

3662
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:27,520
But there was a

3663
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:28,520
Separate thing

3664
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:29,520
Like if you want to

3665
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:30,520
Look up gaming videos

3666
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:31,520
Just go to YouTube

3667
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:32,520
Exactly

3668
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:33,520
I'm not going to fucking

3669
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:34,520
Go to a separate app

3670
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:35,520
For gaming

3671
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,520
And like

3672
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:37,520
I'll just watch it

3673
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,520
On YouTube

3674
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,520
Yeah I think that

3675
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,520
Kind of like

3676
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:41,520
Never like

3677
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,520
Truly caught on

3678
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,520
I really think

3679
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,520
The YouTube gaming thing

3680
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,520
Was really primarily

3681
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,520
For the app

3682
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,520
But when anything

3683
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,520
You link online

3684
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:49,520
And stuff

3685
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,520
Is going to open

3686
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:51,520
In the default

3687
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,520
YouTube app

3688
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:53,520
Like if I

3689
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,520
If I tweet

3690
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:55,520
My YouTube or something

3691
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,520
YouTube gaming

3692
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,520
Was always just kind of like

3693
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:58,520
This different shell

3694
01:18:58,520 --> 01:18:59,520
This different set of clothes

3695
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:00,520
That nobody went for

3696
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:01,520
A YouTube feature

3697
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,520
That's not coming

3698
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:03,520
Together correctly

3699
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,520
No

3700
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,520
Not my YouTube

3701
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:07,520
Well

3702
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:08,520
I'm pretty sure

3703
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:09,520
YouTube has already

3704
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,520
Been blocked in China

3705
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:12,520
But now

3706
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:13,520
Twitch can join them

3707
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,520
In that circle

3708
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:15,520
Twitch has been

3709
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,520
Banned in China

3710
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,520
That was some big news

3711
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,520
That hit around the

3712
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:19,520
Internet this week

3713
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,520
This is because

3714
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:22,520
I guess

3715
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:23,520
Let's see

3716
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,520
China took home

3717
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:25,520
Two gold medals

3718
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,520
In the Jakarta

3719
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,520
Palembang 2018

3720
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:29,520
Asian games

3721
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,520
It's a pan Asian

3722
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:31,520
Multisport tournament basically

3723
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:32,520
So there's

3724
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:33,520
There's many different

3725
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,520
Games that are played

3726
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,520
Amongst all these different countries

3727
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,520
Think of it like the Olympics

3728
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:37,520
But like eSports

3729
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,520
Over in Asia

3730
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:39,520
So China

3731
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:40,520
You know made its mark

3732
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:41,520
But unfortunately

3733
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,520
CCTV did not broadcast

3734
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,520
The event

3735
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,520
So Chinese fans

3736
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,520
Went to Twitch

3737
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:46,520
So a huge spike

3738
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,520
In downloads

3739
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,520
For the streaming site

3740
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,520
Now this pings it

3741
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,520
On Twitch's radar

3742
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:51,520
And now

3743
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:52,520
Twitch's website

3744
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,520
Is inaccessible

3745
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:54,520
It's inaccessible

3746
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:55,520
In China

3747
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:56,520
You can't get it

3748
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:57,520
On the iOS app store

3749
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,520
And you know this

3750
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:00,520
Many observers

3751
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:01,520
And analysts saying

3752
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,520
That this is kind of a regular thing

3753
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:05,520
Western media platforms

3754
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,520
That get very popular

3755
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:08,520
End up getting blocked

3756
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:09,520
Twitch has confirmed

3757
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:10,520
They've been blocked

3758
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:11,520
In China

3759
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:12,520
But they don't have any other details

3760
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:13,520
At this time

3761
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:14,520
So in some ways

3762
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:15,520
It's kind of a

3763
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:16,520
You made it kid

3764
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:17,520
And in other ways

3765
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:18,520
It's a

3766
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:19,520
Well that's a bummer

3767
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,520
Because there were probably

3768
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:21,520
Folks in China

3769
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:22,520
That wanted to watch

3770
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,520
But they can't

3771
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:24,520
Because they were being streamed

3772
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,520
On Twitch

3773
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,520
And what

3774
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,520
How does this affect

3775
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:28,520
Overwatch League

3776
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:29,520
I'm kind of curious

3777
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,520
Because don't we have

3778
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:33,520
An expansion team in China

3779
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:34,520
And all those games

3780
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:36,520
Were being broadcast on Twitch

3781
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:37,520
Or do they go

3782
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,520
Are they on a

3783
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,520
Different platform in China

3784
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:41,520
Maybe they are

3785
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,520
I just may not be aware

3786
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:43,520
That there may be a

3787
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,520
China centric

3788
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,520
Live streaming platform

3789
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:47,520
That they use over there

3790
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,520
So I'm kind of curious about that

3791
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,520
So there you go

3792
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,520
So there you go

3793
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:53,520
So unfortunately

3794
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:54,520
When we

3795
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:55,520
Just finally make our move

3796
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,520
To Twitch

3797
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:57,520
Which is you know

3798
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,520
Still on the radar

3799
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,520
If these cable issues

3800
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,520
Get fixed

3801
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:01,520
We should be

3802
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,520
Making our own move

3803
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:03,520
To Twitch

3804
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:04,520
Folks in China

3805
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:05,520
Won't be able to see it

3806
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,520
Live unfortunately

3807
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:07,520
But I don't think

3808
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:08,520
Anybody in China

3809
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:09,520
Is listening live today

3810
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:10,520
If you are

3811
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:11,520
You should let us know

3812
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,520
Because I would love

3813
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:13,520
To hear from you

3814
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,520
But remember

3815
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,520
The podcast is not

3816
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,520
Going to be changing at all

3817
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:17,520
So if we have Chinese

3818
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,520
Folks that listen

3819
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:19,520
On the podcast

3820
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,520
Well that will still

3821
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:21,520
Be the same

3822
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,520
Similar sort of set up

3823
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:23,520
That you get it today

3824
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,520
So

3825
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:25,520
Act F says

3826
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:26,520
I think Overwatch League games

3827
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,520
Are also on

3828
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,520
Major League gaming's website

3829
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,520
Gotcha

3830
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:31,520
I was going to say

3831
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,520
There's got to be

3832
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,520
Another option

3833
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,520
Because that would be a bummer

3834
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:35,520
To have this whole expansion team

3835
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,520
For Overwatch League

3836
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:38,520
And then

3837
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:39,520
People in that city

3838
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,520
Can't even watch it

3839
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:41,520
Even though everybody

3840
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:42,520
Is living in LA anyway

3841
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:43,520
But oh well

3842
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:44,520
Alright

3843
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:45,520
Let's go back to

3844
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,520
When things were simpler

3845
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:47,520
Let's go back to a time

3846
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,520
When we couldn't

3847
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:49,520
Live stream games

3848
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:50,520
You wanted to watch

3849
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:51,520
We play a game

3850
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:52,520
And you'd come over

3851
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:53,520
And sit on the couch

3852
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,520
Or we had to put

3853
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:55,520
Our video camera

3854
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:56,520
In front of our TV

3855
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,520
To videotape

3856
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:58,520
The high sports

3857
01:21:58,520 --> 01:21:59,520
And the VHS tape

3858
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,520
That's right

3859
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:01,520
Or when I was playing

3860
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,520
Ultima Exodus

3861
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,520
I would use

3862
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,520
The sight spell

3863
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:05,520
To get the map

3864
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:06,520
For the dungeon

3865
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:07,520
And I would record it

3866
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,520
So I could refer

3867
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:09,520
To it later

3868
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,520
I used to draw my maps

3869
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:11,520
My Zelda maps

3870
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,520
Nice

3871
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,520
Alright

3872
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,520
On old food foods

3873
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:15,520
So I had them

3874
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,520
On denim

3875
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:17,520
And rolled up this fold

3876
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,520
It is the classic

3877
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:19,520
Needed this week

3878
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,520
Dark soccer is gonna

3879
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:21,520
Climb into the gaming vault

3880
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,520
And find a game or two

3881
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:23,520
Which she thinks

3882
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:24,520
Hey

3883
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:25,520
You kids

3884
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:26,520
Play this game

3885
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:27,520
You don't need

3886
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,520
No hundred dollar

3887
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:29,520
Stinkin' PlayStation

3888
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:30,520
Classic to play this

3889
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:31,520
This is pre-rumble pack

3890
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:32,520
N64 shit here

3891
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:33,520
That's right

3892
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:34,520
Here it is

3893
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:35,520
Your classic game of the week

3894
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:36,520
Dark soccer

3895
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:37,520
What did you pick

3896
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,520
For the classic game

3897
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:39,520
Of the week this week?

3898
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,520
I picked Chameleon Twist

3899
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:41,520
Yay

3900
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,520
Um

3901
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:43,520
It is a pretty difficult game

3902
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:44,520
It has a weird

3903
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,520
Continue system

3904
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:47,520
But it's treasure

3905
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:48,520
Wait

3906
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:49,520
No it's not

3907
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,520
It's done soft

3908
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,520
It's pre-treasure

3909
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,520
Stuff

3910
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:53,520
Anyway

3911
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,520
Um

3912
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:55,520
Chameleon Twist

3913
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:56,520
Um

3914
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:57,520
Is

3915
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:58,520
We play as one of four

3916
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,520
Chameleons

3917
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:00,520
And you go over

3918
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:01,520
Different worlds

3919
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:02,520
Um

3920
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,520
It has a very long

3921
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,520
Tongue

3922
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:05,520
To use as a weapon

3923
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,520
And you can also use it

3924
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,520
Kind of as a grappling hook

3925
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,520
And you can use

3926
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:10,520
The tongue

3927
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:11,520
You basically

3928
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,520
Move the tongue

3929
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:13,520
On its own

3930
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,520
With the analog stick

3931
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:17,520
And you also have

3932
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,520
Like a training area

3933
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:19,520
That you can learn

3934
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,520
How to master

3935
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:21,520
The tongue

3936
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:22,520
Um

3937
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,520
So you have to go through

3938
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:25,520
Different indoor environments

3939
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,520
You have a boss battle

3940
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:28,520
And then you have to keep

3941
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:29,520
Collecting hearts to

3942
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:30,520
Replenish your

3943
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:31,520
Uh

3944
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:32,520
Your health

3945
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:33,520
And you play as

3946
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:34,520
A chameleon

3947
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:35,520
Called

3948
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:36,520
Davy

3949
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,520
And he follows

3950
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:38,520
A white rabbit

3951
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:39,520
Into a magical ground

3952
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,520
In the hole

3953
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:41,520
And he becomes

3954
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:42,520
A humanoid

3955
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:43,520
In Wonderland

3956
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,520
His friends are

3957
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:45,520
Jack, Fred, and Linda

3958
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,520
White people names

3959
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,520
I don't

3960
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:48,520
Like seriously

3961
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:49,520
Um

3962
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,520
No

3963
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:51,520
I would say

3964
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,520
Probably like

3965
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:53,520
Caitlin's

3966
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:54,520
But spelled differently

3967
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:55,520
Anyway

3968
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,520
Um

3969
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:57,520
So with the

3970
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,520
B button

3971
01:23:58,520 --> 01:23:59,520
You stick out

3972
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,520
Your tongue

3973
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,520
By the way

3974
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:02,520
This was on

3975
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:03,520
Nintendo 64

3976
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,520
And then you move

3977
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,520
The tongue around

3978
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:06,520
With the analog stick

3979
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:07,520
Which controls

3980
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:08,520
You know

3981
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,520
The movement there

3982
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:10,520
So you can use that

3983
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:11,520
To get power ups

3984
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,520
At a distance

3985
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:13,520
Or just swallow

3986
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:14,520
Enemies

3987
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:15,520
And it will retract

3988
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:16,520
Back

3989
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,520
Or until it bumps

3990
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,520
A wall

3991
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,520
Which will also

3992
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:20,520
Make it back

3993
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:21,520
Uh

3994
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:22,520
Go back

3995
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:23,520
So it is just

3996
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,520
A standard

3997
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:25,520
You know

3998
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:26,520
Tongue thing

3999
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:27,520
When they swallow

4000
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,520
The enemies

4001
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:29,520
But you have the option

4002
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,520
Of spitting the

4003
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,520
Enemy back out

4004
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:32,520
Um

4005
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:33,520
At the other enemies

4006
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,520
Kind of

4007
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:35,520
You know

4008
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,520
Uh

4009
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:37,520
Roshi

4010
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:38,520
Or Kirby style

4011
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,520
I mean

4012
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:40,520
Except Kirby

4013
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:41,520
Actually spits out

4014
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:42,520
All your cute stars

4015
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:43,520
Um

4016
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,520
You know

4017
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,520
You can launch

4018
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,520
Into the air

4019
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:47,520
By using your tongue

4020
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,520
Um

4021
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:49,520
You get

4022
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,520
Like

4023
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:51,520
Pretty much

4024
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,520
Tongue vaulting

4025
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:53,520
Tongue pull vaulting

4026
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:54,520
Um

4027
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:55,520
So you actually

4028
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:56,520
Can use a pull

4029
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:57,520
Um

4030
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,520
With the tongue

4031
01:24:58,520 --> 01:24:59,520
As a grapple

4032
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,520
And swing yourself

4033
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:01,520
Across

4034
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:02,520
You also have

4035
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:03,520
Multi player mode

4036
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:04,520
Which is two to four players

4037
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:05,520
That has a battle royale

4038
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,520
Or a time trial

4039
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:07,520
Where um

4040
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:08,520
You have to be

4041
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,520
The last chameleon

4042
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,520
Standing on the platform

4043
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:11,520
For battle royale

4044
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,520
Um

4045
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,520
For the time trial

4046
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:14,520
Um

4047
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:15,520
You have to stay

4048
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:16,520
On the platform

4049
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:17,520
The longest

4050
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:18,520
And that's

4051
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:19,520
Really

4052
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,520
It

4053
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,520
Came out in 1997

4054
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:22,520
That was a while ago

4055
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,520
God damn these fucking ads

4056
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:25,520
Ad block Rob

4057
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:26,520
Ad block

4058
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:27,520
I thought I had it

4059
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:28,520
On this computer

4060
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,520
It's just time to upgrade

4061
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:31,520
YouTube

4062
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,520
Uh

4063
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:33,520
It's time to upgrade

4064
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:34,520
A lot

4065
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:35,520
But that's it

4066
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:36,520
It's Chameleon Twist

4067
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:37,520
I don't know why I had it

4068
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:38,520
In my brain

4069
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,520
This was a treasure game

4070
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:40,520
Well

4071
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:41,520
It is a treasure

4072
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:42,520
Of a different sort

4073
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,520
There it is

4074
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:44,520
Poopy treasure

4075
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:45,520
Your classic game of the week

4076
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,520
Chameleon Twist

4077
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:48,520
Sunsoft

4078
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,520
Alright

4079
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,520
Uh

4080
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,520
We're gonna take a break

4081
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:52,520
Uh

4082
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:53,520
We haven't done that

4083
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:54,520
In a little while

4084
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:55,520
Cause we've had magic

4085
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:56,520
To hold us over

4086
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:57,520
We're gonna take a break

4087
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:58,520
Rob Cluffy

4088
01:25:58,520 --> 01:25:59,520
When we come back

4089
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,520
There'll be plenty more

4090
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,520
Orange Lounge Radio

4091
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:02,520

And some other

4097

Rapid fire news

4098
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:09,520
We'll talk a little bit

4099
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:10,520
About pinball

4100
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:11,520
And Fortnite news

4101
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:12,520
But maybe

4102
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:13,520
Yay

4103
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:14,520
Maybe for some people

4104
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:15,520
It's actually a positive

4105
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:16,520
I'll tell you what we mean

4106
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:17,520
After we come back

4107
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:18,520
From the break

4108
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:19,520

Already in progress

For tonight

4115
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:36,520
September 23rd of 2018

4116
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:37,520
Dark Sakura joining us

4117
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,520
In studio

4118
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:39,520
Who has um

4119
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:40,520
Not been able to be here

4120
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:41,520
At the show live

4121
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:42,520
For about a month

4122
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:43,520
And unfortunately

4123
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:44,520
Probably for a couple

4124
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:45,520
More months

4125
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:46,520
But able to visit

4126
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:47,520
Like once a month

4127
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:48,520
Yeah and I'm

4128
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:49,520
Because of work

4129
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:50,520
Yeah because of work

4130
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:51,520
I'm trying to

4131
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:52,520
Get things together

4132
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:53,520
You know

4133
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:54,520
But I will say

4134
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:55,520
Speaking of work

4135
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:56,520
I know I don't

4136
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:57,520
Want to get into

4137
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:58,520
Too many details

4138
01:26:58,520 --> 01:26:59,520
Cause isn't anyone's business

4139
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:00,520
What you do during the day

4140
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:01,520
But I did hear

4141
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:02,520
You got like a promotion

4142
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:03,520
You were going for at work

4143
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:04,520
So

4144
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:05,520
I'll put it this way

4145
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:06,520
Big ups on that

4146
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:07,520
Congrats

4147
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,520
It was actually

4148
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:09,520
It was the first job

4149
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,520
I applied and interviewed for

4150
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:12,520
Was in this position

4151
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,520
And it wasn't the one I got

4152
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:15,520
Because I think they were

4153
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:16,520
Opening it for other temps

4154
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:17,520
At the time

4155
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,520
But I have

4156
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:20,520
Gone up through the ranks

4157
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:21,520
As high as I could go

4158
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:22,520
In one direction

4159
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:23,520
And I finally am in the

4160
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:24,520
Department I wanted to be in

4161
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:25,520
So

4162
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:26,520
So as much as it sucks

4163
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:27,520
That you can't always be here

4164
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,520
On Sundays

4165
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:29,520
This is a good thing for your

4166
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:30,520
You know

4167
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:31,520
And I got a raise out of it

4168
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,520
So

4169
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:33,520
Yeah so for your

4170
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:34,520
So as much as it sucks

4171
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:35,520
For you not being here

4172
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,520
The reality is

4173
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:37,520
You know

4174
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:38,520
You're part of what you got to

4175
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:39,520
Do to make that happen

4176
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,520
So

4177
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:41,520
I just want to give you

4178
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:42,520
Congratulations

4179
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:43,520
I'm sure all the listeners are

4180
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:44,520
Going to say the same type of

4181
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:45,520
Thing in chat

4182
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:46,520
Because y'all rock here at

4183
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:47,520
Orange Lawn Radio

4184
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:48,520
It's appreciated

4185
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:49,520
And I'm happy to do my radio

4186
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:50,520
Magic you know

4187
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:51,520
Yeah

4188
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:52,520
Come over and visit

4189
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:53,520
And do what I can to make

4190
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:54,520
Make sure y'all don't forget

4191
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:55,520
About me

4192
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,520
We would

4193
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:57,520
We could never

4194
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:58,520
We would never

4195
01:27:58,520 --> 01:27:59,520
You could

4196
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,520
You need to do more streaming

4197
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:01,520
And that type of stuff

4198
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:02,520
To keep us remembering

4199
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:03,520
Who you are

4200
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,520
Actually

4201
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:05,520
To get me back to doing

4202
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:06,520
More World of Warcraft

4203
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:07,520
And you know

4204
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:08,520
Cussing at people

4205
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:09,520
I cuss at the characters

4206
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,520
In the game Rob

4207
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,520
I tell them that they're

4208
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:13,520
Shitholes

4209
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:14,520
You kind of should

4210
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,520
Like Sylvanas is totally a bitch

4211
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:16,520
Now

4212
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:17,520
Like what happened

4213
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:18,520
Like

4214
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:19,520
And I'm not just saying

4215
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:20,520
I'm not saying that because

4216
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:21,520
It's the cheap shot

4217
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:22,520
Because she's a woman

4218
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:23,520
And anything

4219
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,520
She is a bitch

4220
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:25,520
She has turned into full on

4221
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:26,520
Cunt monster

4222
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:27,520
Okay you said it

4223
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:28,520
I didn't

4224
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:29,520
No I'm like

4225
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:30,520
They're ruining her

4226
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:31,520
They're ruining her

4227
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,520
They are

4228
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:33,520
I used to like her

4229
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:34,520
And now she's like

4230
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:35,520
Why are you such a bitch

4231
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,520
Like what crawled up your mall

4232
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,520
And died

4233
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:39,520
You know

4234
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,520
Oh yeah

4235
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,520
She's already dead inside

4236
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:42,520
You know what I still think

4237
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:43,520
That it would serve her right

4238
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,520
If they made her alive again

4239
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,520
Like for the final thing

4240
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:47,520
I've

4241
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,520
I've heard fan wank theories

4242
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:50,520
Nothing official obviously

4243
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:51,520
Blizzard's keeping that under wraps

4244
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,520
But fan wank theory

4245
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:56,520
Seems to think that's how this ends

4246
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:58,520
Like it would be a much fitting

4247
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,520
End for her

4248
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:02,520
As opposed to what happened to Garrosh

4249
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:03,520
Yeah

4250
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:04,520
So it'd be interesting

4251
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:05,520
To get in that direction

4252
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:06,520
So

4253
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:09,520
And they've done all these books

4254
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:10,520
Like with her and her sisters

4255
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:11,520
Getting back together

4256
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:12,520
In different books

4257
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:13,520
And everything

4258
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:14,520
So

4259
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,520
But I'm still doing the Argus content

4260
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,520
Because I want to make a void elf

4261
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:20,520
Although I will probably still play

4262
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:22,520
My demon hunty

4263
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:24,520
Because demon hunters fun

4264
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:25,520
Yeah

4265
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:26,520
I kind of miss my

4266
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:27,520
My monk

4267
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:28,520
My tauren monk

4268
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:29,520
But my monk

4269
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:30,520
I have a pandaren

4270
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:31,520
My one bitch about

4271
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:32,520
Well I'll say this

4272
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:33,520
Then we'll get back into some

4273
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:34,520
My one bitch about

4274
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:35,520
Wow

4275
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,520
I do not like how they

4276
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:37,520
Locked those races

4277
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:38,520
Behind these dumb achievements

4278
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,520
In the last expansion

4279
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:41,520
That you have to

4280
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:42,520
That's stupid

4281
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:43,520
I'm sorry

4282
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:44,520
I'm glad I got my

4283
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:45,520
My

4284
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,520
What the fuck elf

4285
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:47,520
Nightfallen

4286
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,520
Uh huh

4287
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:49,520
When I did

4288
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:50,520
Before they put it behind

4289
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:51,520
Well actually no

4290
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:52,520
I was already

4291
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:53,520
I already had

4292
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:54,520
Elevated?

4293
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:55,520
Exalted

4294
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:56,520
With

4295
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:57,520
With the

4296
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,520
With that faction anyway

4297
01:29:58,520 --> 01:29:59,520
So maybe that's why I got it

4298
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:00,520
I don't know

4299
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:01,520
I just don't like it

4300
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:02,520
It's dumb

4301
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:03,520
It's stupid

4302
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:04,520
Alright

4303
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:05,520
How dare they

4304
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:06,520
You know what's awesome

4305
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:07,520
Some more gaming news

4306
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,520
Rapid fire news

4307
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:09,520
Starting off with Loki

4308
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:10,520
Yes let's talk about

4309
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,520
One of my favorite franchises

4310
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:14,520
Earth Defense Force

4311
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:15,520
Right around the corner

4312
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,520
Earth Defense Force 5

4313
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,520
Another game where you'll be

4314
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,520
Shooting giant bugs

4315
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,520
And they don't really change

4316
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,520
A whole lot each game

4317
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:24,520
But

4318
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:25,520
It's a new one

4319
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:26,520
And it's coming out

4320
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:27,520
December 11th

4321
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:28,520
Right around the corner

4322
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:29,520
On Playstation 4

4323
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,520
Hopefully PC at some point soon

4324
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,520
I'll have to pick it up

4325
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:34,520
Because I do

4326
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:35,520
Because it's Earth Defense Force

4327
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:36,520
And it's you

4328
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:37,520
Of course you're gonna pick it up

4329
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:38,520
It's Earth Defense Force

4330
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:39,520
And it's like the same

4331
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:40,520
Like when I talk about

4332
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:41,520
Roster update man

4333
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:42,520
That game is just like

4334
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:43,520
It's the same shit

4335
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:44,520
All the time

4336
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,520
But I'm down

4337
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:47,520
I'll bite you

4338
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,520
You're gonna eat that shit up

4339
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:50,520
With a spoon

4340
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,520
And there's nothing wrong with that

4341
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,520
Yes I will

4342
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:53,520
I will do that

4343
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:54,520
There is a rumor

4344
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:55,520
That there is a possible

4345
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,520
Leaked

4346
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:58,520
Character from Smash Brothers Ultimate

4347
01:30:58,520 --> 01:30:59,520
Of course

4348
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:00,520
Oh it must be a day

4349
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:01,520
Ending in Y

4350
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:02,520
On some web forum

4351
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:03,520
Of course

4352
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:04,520
Remember that

4353
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:05,520
There are a lot of

4354
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:06,520
Faked screenshots

4355
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:07,520
So take this

4356
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,520
With a grain of salt

4357
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:11,520
But the picture shows Ken

4358
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:13,520
Of Street Fighter 2

4359
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:14,520
It could see that

4360
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:15,520
Being like an echo fighter

4361
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:16,520
For Ryu or something like that

4362
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:17,520
But

4363
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,520
That is a very obvious

4364
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:19,520
Sort of echo character

4365
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,520
But

4366
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:21,520
It could also be

4367
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:22,520
Incredibly bullshit

4368
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:23,520
Fakes

4369
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,520
So

4370
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:25,520
Keep that in mind as well

4371
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:26,520
But it is something that

4372
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:27,520
I can see

4373
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:28,520
Where they pad the roster

4374
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:29,520
With that

4375
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:30,520
So

4376
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:31,520
Yeah

4377
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:32,520
Don't be surprised

4378
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:33,520
If that's an announcement

4379
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:34,520
But don't be not surprised

4380
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:35,520
If it's completely fake

4381
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:36,520
Because

4382
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,520
You know

4383
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:38,520
A perfect

4384
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:39,520
Perfect way to say that there

4385
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:40,520
Don't be surprised

4386
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:41,520
If it happens

4387
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:42,520
But you know what

4388
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:43,520
Don't be surprised

4389
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:44,520
If it doesn't happen

4390
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:46,520
Just don't be surprised

4391
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:47,520
It's the internet y'all

4392
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:48,520
Darktotu in chat

4393
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:49,520
Over at Live.com

4394
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:50,520
And I'll see you

4395
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:51,520
In the next one

4396
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:52,520
Bye

4397
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:53,520
Bye

4398
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:54,520
Darktotu in chat

4399
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:55,520
Over at Live.vognetwork.com

4400
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,520
Says

4401
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:57,520
I want to believe Ken

4402
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:58,520
Is really in the game

4403
01:31:58,520 --> 01:31:59,520
But yeah

4404
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:00,520
I'm trying hard

4405
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:01,520
Not to fall for this

4406
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:02,520
I mean

4407
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:03,520
It's

4408
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:04,520
It does make a lot of sense

4409
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:05,520
They just

4410
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:06,520
They don't really have to give

4411
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:07,520
Him anything special

4412
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:08,520
It would just be a different look

4413
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:09,520
Just an echo fighter

4414
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:10,520
Yeah

4415
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:11,520
Just an echo fighter

4416
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:12,520
Alright

4417
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:13,520
We'll see

4418
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:14,520
Anyway

4419
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:15,520
Moving on with some more

4420
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:16,520
Rapid fire news

4421
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:17,520
This is certainly deserving

4422
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,520
Of a

4423
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:19,520
Of a longer story slot

4424
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,520
But there isn't a lot

4425
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:21,520
To say on this

4426
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:22,520
Nobuo Imatsu

4427
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:23,520
He did every Final Fantasy

4428
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:24,520
Soundtrack pre-11

4429
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:25,520
He's done a lot of this stuff

4430
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:26,520
Since then too

4431
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:28,520
He did music for Chrono Trigger

4432
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:29,520
You know

4433
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:30,520
Lots of great RPGs

4434
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:31,520
He can probably think of

4435
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,520
He is ceasing his current work

4436
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,520
Due to health problems

4437
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:36,520
He hasn't said what the health problem was

4438
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:38,520
But he did say on his blog

4439
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:39,520
In a post that he made

4440
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:40,520
He's been affected by

4441
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:42,520
A unnamed disease

4442
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,520
For a few years

4443
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,520
And it's now at a point

4444
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:45,520
Where he is unable to act

4445
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:47,520
At full capacity

4446
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,520
So he's taking time to rest

4447
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,520
And considering if he's

4448
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:51,520
Gonna be able to do

4449
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:53,520
Any future projects at all

4450
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:54,520
Again we don't know

4451
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:55,520
What the illness is

4452
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:56,520
I'm not going to speculate here

4453
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:57,520
Certainly many people are

4454
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:58,520
You know

4455
01:32:58,520 --> 01:32:59,520
Inventing the scenarios

4456
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,520
In their head

4457
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:01,520
I'm just gonna hope

4458
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,520
That he gets better

4459
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:03,520
This

4460
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:04,520
This is a decision

4461
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:05,520
He's come to with his doctors

4462
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:06,520
That if he's

4463
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,520
It takes a break from work

4464
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:08,520
And the stress

4465
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:09,520
That comes with it

4466
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:10,520
For a little while

4467
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:11,520
It's gonna help him get better

4468
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:12,520
I'm really really gonna hope

4469
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:13,520
That that is the case

4470
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:14,520
Cause Nobuo Imatsu

4471
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:15,520
He's not

4472
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:16,520
He's in his 50's

4473
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:17,520
His late 50's

4474
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:18,520
Not an old guy

4475
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:19,520
So it's just

4476
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:20,520
Yeah

4477
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:21,520
You know

4478
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,520
Sending well wishes

4479
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:23,520
And thoughts

4480
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:24,520
And you know

4481
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:25,520
Healing vibes

4482
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:26,520
His way

4483
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:27,520
And you know

4484
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:28,520
Obviously his impact

4485
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:29,520
To games

4486
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:30,520
Has been extraordinary

4487
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:31,520
But if he needs to take a break

4488
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,520
He's fucking earned it

4489
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:35,520
So let's give him his privacy

4490
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,520
Moving on to Tetris Effect

4491
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:38,520
Which Dark Soccer brought up

4492
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:39,520
A little bit earlier

4493
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:40,520
But I'll kind of

4494
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:41,520
Finish the thought here

4495
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:42,520
Because not only did

4496
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:43,520
We get to see that

4497
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:44,520
At the Tokyo Game Show

4498
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:45,520
We got a date

4499
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:46,520
For that game

4500
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:47,520
November 9th

4501
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:48,520
Is when you can all start

4502
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:49,520
Feeling Tetris Effect

4503
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:50,520
So I'll finally be in my

4504
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:51,520
PlayStation VR

4505
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:52,520
By November 9th

4506
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:53,520
Go play Rez

4507
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:54,520
Come on

4508
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:55,520
And I need to play this

4509
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:56,520
I understand that you have

4510
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:57,520
Like space issues in your room

4511
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:58,520
But here's the best part

4512
01:33:58,520 --> 01:33:59,520
About it

4513
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:00,520
The camera

4514
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:01,520
Doesn't have to be on top

4515
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:02,520
Of the TV

4516
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:03,520
You can face it and complete

4517
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,520
Oh that's good

4518
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:05,520
I played VR in my kitchen

4519
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,520
Without a TV even hooked up

4520
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:08,520
Alright that's good to know

4521
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:09,520
It's good to know

4522
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:10,520
But anyway of course

4523
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,520
You know

4524
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:12,520
Everything else we've heard

4525
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:13,520
About Tetris

4526
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:14,520
Nothing else has changed

4527
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,520
That zone mechanic

4528
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:16,520
Where you can freeze time

4529
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:17,520
And kind of build up

4530
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:18,520
Your Tetris clears and stuff

4531
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:19,520
And all that

4532
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:20,520
So PlayStation 4

4533
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:21,520
On November 9th

4534
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:22,520
That is the big day for that

4535
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:23,520
DarkSakura

4536
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:24,520
You've got a couple of things

4537
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:25,520
For us

4538
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:26,520
I do

4539
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:27,520
There has been something

4540
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:29,520
Sent to the Game Rating

4541
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,520
And Admission

4542
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:32,520
Administration Committee

4543
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:33,520
Of Korea

4544
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:34,520
They have a rating out

4545
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:35,520
For Castlevania Requiem

4546
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,520
Symphony of the Night

4547
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:37,520
And Rondo of Blood

4548
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:38,520
For PlayStation 4

4549
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:40,520
For a Japanese

4550
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:41,520
Language release

4551
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:43,520
We don't have any announcements

4552
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:44,520
From Konami out here

4553
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,520
But I mean that would simply be

4554
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:47,520
Not turn in the moonlight

4555
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:48,520
And Rondo of Blood

4556
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:49,520
So yay

4557
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:50,520
I hope

4558
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:51,520
Could use another copy

4559
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,520
Of that game

4560
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:54,520
And then also

4561
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:56,520
Sega announced a release

4562
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:58,520
Of Sega Genesis Classics

4563
01:34:58,520 --> 01:34:59,520
For Nintendo Switch

4564
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,520
Will be a 50 plus game bundle

4565
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:02,520

And Toejam and Earl

4572
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:11,520
So there you go

4573
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:15,520
Alright

4574
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:16,520
Let's travel around the world

4575
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:17,520
And check out some release

4576
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:18,520
Dates of things you get

4577
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:19,520
To play a little sooner

4578
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:20,520

01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:07,520
I'm surprised

4666
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:08,520
But then again

4667
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:09,520
not surprised

4668
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:11,520
Alright

4669
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:12,520
Welcome to Japan

4670
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:13,520
and looking at some of the releases there

4671
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:14,520
on the PlayStation 4

4672
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:16,520
on September the 27th

4673
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:19,520
Iyudensetsu Senokisuke 4

4674
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:21,520
The End of Saga

4675
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:22,520
from Falcom

4676
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:23,520
comes out

4677
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:24,520
on again

4678
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:26,520
September the 27th

4679
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:27,520
is when that is out

4680
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:29,520
and this game looks like

4681
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:30,520
I'm trying to think if it's something that's

4682
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:31,520
localized here

4683
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:32,520
but I don't think it is

4684
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:33,520
Legend Heroes?

4685
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:34,520
Maybe?

4686
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:35,520
Something like that?

4687
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,520
I don't know

4688
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:37,520
This game

4689
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:38,520
What's it called?

4690
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:39,520
Iyudensetsu Senokisuke 4

4691
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:40,520
The End of Saga

4692
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:43,520
I don't know

4693
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:44,520
Legend Heroes?

4694
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:45,520
Might be?

4695
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:46,520
Anyway

4696
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:47,520
That is coming out

4697
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,520
That seems to be kind of the big

4698
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:49,520
Legend of Heroes is what

4699
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:51,520
Dr. Tetsuya thinks it is

4700
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:53,520
Utaware Urumono Zan

4701
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,520

has a premium edition with that as well

4707
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:07,520

01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:09,520

as well as MotoGP 18

4723
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,520
Kind of a busy week there in Japan

4724
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,520
Taking a look at the Nintendo Switch real fast

4725
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,520
to see if we're getting anything there

4726
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:36,520
Oh yes

4727
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:37,520
The World Ends With You Final Remix

4728
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:38,520
I think some folks looking forward to that

4729
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:40,520
That is out in Japan this week on the Switch

4730
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,520
Senju no Valkyria 4

4731
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:44,520
which I imagine is Valkyria Chronicles 4

4732
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,520
also out this week on the Switch in Japan

4733
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:48,520
That's Super Neptunia RPG

4734
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:49,520
also out this week

4735
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:50,520
and

4736
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:52,520

4737
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:53,520
also out

4738
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:54,520

is out on the Switch this week in Japan

4741
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:00,520
So I'm sure some folks will be eating that up

4742
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:02,520
Let's go to the UK to our Sakura

4743
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,520

4770
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,520
That's it

4771
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,520
Alright I think we're about to

4772
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,520
head off to the mailbag

4773
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,520
Every week you guys email us

4774
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:03,520
participate at

4775
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:06,520
and we read your emails here live on air

4776
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:08,520
as long as you keep them classy

4777
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:10,520
appropriate and all that

4778
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:12,520
and we're gonna get into the mailbag this week

4779
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:14,520
so let's do it

4780
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:15,520
Dark Sakura's here

4781
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:16,520
So she should read the emails again

4782
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:17,520
I've been doing it lately

4783
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,520
but I think Dark Sakura should get back to reading emails

4784
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:20,520
What do you think Dark Sakura?

4785
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,520
Sure

4786
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:24,520
So this comes from Ryan

4787
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:28,520
Hey O.L.R. while hanging out in the VOG Network Discord

4788
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:30,520
which you can also participate in at

4789
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:32,520
vognetwork.com slash discord

4790
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,520
Brilliant plug

4791
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:36,520
Thank Ryan

4792
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:38,520
I noticed that Alan plays a bit of Dark Souls

4793
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:40,520
whether a newbie or a seasoned player

4794
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:42,520
I'm curious to hear about his experiences with the game

4795
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:44,520
or if he had any cool stories to share

4796
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:46,520
Love the show, Ryan

4797
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:48,520
Alan was not in here to hear this message

4798
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:50,520
No, Alan was not in here to hear this message

4799
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:52,520
I will fix that here shortly

4800
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:54,520
I'll get him in here, see if he's available

4801
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:56,520
if he's not in the middle of an Overwatch match

4802
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:58,520
Do we have another email?

4803
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:00,520
Why don't you read that one while I work on Alan

4804
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:02,520
Okay

4805
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:04,520
Last episode you were discussing the face

4806
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:06,520
of each company and couldn't come with

4807
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:08,520
one for Sony other than Kazurai

4808
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:10,520
who left Playstation inside of the company

4809
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:12,520
in 2012

4810
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:14,520
Here are a few guys you couldn't think of

4811
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:16,520
Andrew House, Adam Boyz, and Shuhei Yoshida

4812
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:18,520
The former two were no longer with the company

4813
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:20,520
but were arguably the faces for a while

4814
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:22,520
as they were the ones who show up at PSX

4815
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:24,520
or E3 every stage

4816
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:26,520
up until they left last year

4817
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:28,520
Shuhei is the current president

4818
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:30,520
of Sony Worldwide Studios, i.e. the person

4819
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:32,520
who oversees each of their first-party studios

4820
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:34,520
and also gets a share of stage appearances

4821
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:36,520
Perhaps the fact you couldn't think of them

4822
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:38,520
lends credence to the idea that Sony

4823
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:40,520
doesn't have a strong face

4824
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:42,520
as Iwata or Miyamoto or Reggie

4825
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:44,520
but when you think of someone of the well-known

4826
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,520
Playstation clips, it's usually those people

4827
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:48,520
Like, here's how you share games with a friend

4828
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:50,520
on a PS4 dig at Microsoft

4829
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:52,520
with Shuhei and Adam in the video

4830
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:54,520
Shu does get mobbed at E3 and PSX

4831
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:56,520
for pictures, so he's certainly well-known

4832
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,520
among some groups, and much like Stan Lee

4833
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,520
who was the kickoff for the topic

4834
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:02,520
Shu has had cameos

4835
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:04,520
in a bunch of other video games

4836
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:06,520
Oddly enough, not usually first-party

4837
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:08,520
but indie games like Super Time

4838
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:10,520
Force Ultra, Everything, and Velocity

4839
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:12,520
have used him or his likeness

4840
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:14,520
and this comes from

4841
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:16,520
Andrew, that's all I'm gonna say

4842
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:18,520
I don't have a nickname on it

4843
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:20,520
Probably the closest thing

4844
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:22,520
to a mascot or whatever

4845
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:24,520
Shu is mentioned in that

4846
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:26,520
but I

4847
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,520
still don't know if even that is

4848
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:30,520
on that same level as something like Miyamoto

4849
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:32,520
or Reggie Fils-May

4850
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,520
or has that social media presence

4851
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:36,520
that Major Nelson has on Twitter for Microsoft

4852
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:38,520
or some of that. I still don't feel

4853
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:40,520
like it's quite at the same level

4854
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:42,520
You know what I mean? I don't know

4855
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:44,520
I appreciate their perspective

4856
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:46,520
I kind of get where you're going

4857
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:48,520
some of these guys are really recognized in some circles

4858
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:50,520
but I don't know if they're

4859
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:52,520
the face on that same level

4860
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:54,520
but I should have thought of at least

4861
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:56,520
one of those last week. Anyway

4862
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:58,520
I want to go back to the previous email

4863
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:00,520
I actually made him die on a boss

4864
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:02,520
so he could answer this question

4865
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:04,520
Hi Alan!

4866
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:06,520
Dark Souls

4867
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:08,520
because they're on the Discord servers

4868
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:10,520
they can see that you're playing Dark Souls

4869
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:12,520
all the time. So tell us a little bit about

4870
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:14,520
playing Dark Souls and your experience with that

4871
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:16,520
or if you have cool stories

4872
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:18,520
Just the remastered is out

4873
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:20,520
and I've moved on to Dark Souls 2

4874
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:22,520
because I finally got burned out on the remaster

4875
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:24,520
just these last couple of days

4876
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:26,520
just the versatility of creating a build

4877
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:28,520
like having a strength character that wields

4878
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:30,520
like a giant

4879
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:32,520
basically like a tree

4880
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:34,520
like an uprooted tree that's just like wham

4881
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:36,520
like bam bam from the Flintstones

4882
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:38,520
or like a Dex character

4883
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:40,520
or like a caster

4884
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:42,520
all the different types of weapons

4885
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:44,520
it's a really

4886
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:46,520
there's a lot of stuff under the surface

4887
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:48,520
aside from jest, it's really hard

4888
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:50,520
and then of course a lot of it's

4889
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:52,520
muscle memory so when you

4890
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,520
beat it

4891
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,520
the incentive is there to do

4892
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:58,520
the new game plus stuff because

4893
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:00,520
you're going to have a way more

4894
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:02,520
fun time your second and third time through

4895
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:04,520
because you know how to

4896
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:06,520
get through everything

4897
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:08,520
Now you're

4898
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:10,520
playing so much Dark Souls

4899
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,520
you've actually accomplished the rare accomplishment

4900
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:14,520
of getting what is essential

4901
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:16,520
I mean you're playing it on PC not Playstation 4

4902
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:18,520
but you're getting basically the equivalent of the platinum trophy

4903
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:20,520
you've gotten every single achievement in Dark Souls right?

4904
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:22,520
Yeah the remaster yes

4905
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:24,520
Wow that's pretty crazy

4906
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:26,520
Why do you think this is the game that you want to

4907
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:28,520
and you guys don't live with him

4908
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:30,520
but I do, he plays this game, it's like this and Overwatch

4909
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:32,520
if he's playing something that's not this or Overwatch

4910
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:34,520
I'm like what the hell's going on, you okay?

4911
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:36,520
What is it

4912
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:38,520
Why this game is what you're into right now?

4913
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:42,520
And I'm not asking that in an accusing way I'm just curious

4914
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:44,520
what is driving the passion for that?

4915
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:46,520
I sort of just have a really addictive

4916
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:48,520
personality so when a game catches my attention

4917
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:50,520
I play to the exclusion of all else for three

4918
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:52,520
or four months and then I move on

4919
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:54,520
to something else I'll probably end up

4920
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:56,520
playing Mass Effect again or Skyrim

4921
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:58,520
at some point and you'll be like if you see Skyrim

4922
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:00,520
you're going to see nothing but Skyrim for about three or four months

4923
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:02,520
and then I'll move on to something else

4924
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:04,520
so it's just whatever

4925
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:06,520
You play a game, you play a game

4926
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:08,520
Yes, until I am absolutely sick of it

4927
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:10,520
so it's kind of like

4928
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:12,520
you know

4929
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:14,520
my Steam library

4930
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:16,520
has 300 games that I have only beaten

4931
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:18,520
like 20 of them and I just play those same 20 games

4932
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:20,520
over and over and over again

4933
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:22,520
like Dragon Age Origins and I can't

4934
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:24,520
speedrun that game, if I do another

4935
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:26,520
Origins career it's probably about a 60 or 70

4936
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:28,520
hour commitment

4937
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:30,520
Now you've played Dark Souls 2 as well right?

4938
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:32,520
Yes. But not really 3? Correct.

4939
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:34,520
Why? Just

4940
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:36,520
it's

4941
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:38,520
it's the one I know the least

4942
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:40,520
and I have fear of the unknown

4943
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:42,520
because I can play the other two

4944
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:44,520
inside and out so I'm like okay here's how I get

4945
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:46,520
this really

4946
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:48,520
incredible weapon that makes me overpowered

4947
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:50,520
at a really early level. You weren't always that way right?

4948
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:52,520
True, but you just

4949
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:54,520
I don't know, I just watch

4950
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:56,520
Let's Plays of YouTubes of like here's how to

4951
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,520
become a hex caster

4952
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:00,520
by level 10 and it's like

4953
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:02,520
alright so I just need to do that

4954
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:04,520
for Dark Souls 3. Alright so maybe

4955
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:06,520
maybe in the next 3 or 4 months we'll see

4956
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:08,520
Dark Souls 3. Yes. Alright.

4957
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:10,520
I think you've satisfactorily answered the email

4958
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:12,520
Thank you Alan, round of applause for Alan

4959
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:14,520
Thank you. It says something that

4960
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:16,520
he's quite the spouse

4961
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:18,520
that I can pull him from whatever he's doing to make him

4962
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:20,520
answer a listener email so there you go

4963
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:22,520
Alright were there any more emails?

4964
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:24,520
Yeah there was one more. Okay. Kind of a long one.

4965
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:26,520
Okay. Hey all, thanks for

4966
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:28,520
promoting, this is from Placo Jones by the way

4967
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:30,520
Thanks for promoting my Twitch channel

4968
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:32,520
on the show last week. I was wondering what your

4969
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:34,520
thoughts were about the issues of Nintendo cloud saves

4970
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:36,520
not working for all games. They're really

4971
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:38,520
plugging this feature in the build up to the reveal

4972
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:40,520
of their paid online service. But

4973
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:42,520
just before launch they announced that it won't work

4974
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:44,520
for some games including arguably their best online

4975
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:46,520
title Splatoon 2

4976
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:48,520
There's still no way to back up your saves for

4977
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:50,520
Splatoon 2 and whichever other

4978
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:52,520
online titles they won't allow cloud saves

4979
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:54,520
for. So if your Switch breaks or

4980
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:56,520
gets stolen you lose all that data which for me is

4981
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:58,520
nearly 99 levels in Splatoon 2

4982
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:00,520
as well as my gear gold snail

4983
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:02,520
etc.

4984
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:04,520
They claim to be doing this because people

4985
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:06,520
could use cloud saves to cheat. For example

4986
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:08,520
lose a ranked match that you

4987
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:10,520
that would rank you down. Just reload an old save

4988
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:12,520
from the cloud before that match.

4989
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:14,520
That type of cheating or save

4990
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:16,520
scumming did run rampant in Splatoon

4991
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:18,520
1 but in my opinion isn't really a game

4992
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:20,520
breaking cheat since it only affects that players

4993
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:22,520
rank or some minor gear

4994
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:24,520
update, upgrade rules or whatever else

4995
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:26,520
save scumming could be used for. Usually pretty

4996
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:28,520
minor stuff. Meanwhile

4997
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:30,520
cheaters are everywhere in Splatoon 2 because

4998
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:32,520
if you hack your Switch it's very easy

4999
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:34,520
to tweak anything from your rank to your

5000
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:36,520
weapons abilities to even the maps you

5001
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:38,520
can load onto. So why would cheaters bother

5002
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:40,520
save scumming when they can already

5003
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:42,520
cheat in far more effective and game breaking

5004
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:44,520
ways by hacking. And Nintendo

5005
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:46,520
has no anti-cheat installed to stop these players.

5006
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:48,520
They only go off reports from other players

5007
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:50,520
so a smart cheater would just tweak themselves

5008
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:52,520
to be powerful enough to

5009
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:54,520
dominate matches but not so much that it raises

5010
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:56,520
other players suspicions. Ironically

5011
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:58,520
enough I'm considering hacking my Switch

5012
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:00,520
since only then would I be able to

5013
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:02,520
create a backup save because Nintendo

5014
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:04,520
won't put a little extra work

5015
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:06,520
to do what online games like Overwatch

5016
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:08,520
already do which is just save your account data

5017
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:10,520
on their own server instead of pulling it from

5018
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:12,520
your console. Anyway

5019
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:14,520
that's my rant on the subject. I'm overall very

5020
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:16,520
unimpressed with the implementation of

5021
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:18,520
Nintendo's paid online service

5022
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:20,520
but that's a whole other topic. Thanks for the

5023
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:22,520
great show. Can't wait for your move to

5024
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:24,520
Twitch. Falco Jones. Yeah I just

5025
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,520
you know because I remembered oh yeah I downloaded

5026
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:28,520
the Nintendo app. Their online

5027
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:30,520
app. Let's see what I'm paying for here.

5028
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:32,520
Voice chat. Game specific

5029
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:34,520
services. Splatoon 2.

5030
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:36,520
I don't own Splatoon 2.

5031
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:38,520
That's no fucking

5032
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,520
use to me.

5033
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:42,520
Some comments in chat over at

5034
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:44,520
live.vognetwork.com. Bobby Blackwolf

5035
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:46,520
our pal also on the network here says

5036
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,520
they designed their online system terribly

5037
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:50,520
and are trying to cover it up. They shouldn't

5038
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:52,520
store your online data on your local system

5039
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:54,520
they should store it 100% on their servers.

5040
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:56,520
Exactly. There's a couple people jumping

5041
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:58,520
in going yes this.

5042
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:00,520
And that wouldn't be that hard to fix either

5043
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:02,520
patch the shit. You can

5044
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:04,520
patch your games now Nintendo.

5045
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:06,520
Start storing it on the server

5046
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:08,520
and then just

5047
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:10,520
don't store it locally anymore and then you can do

5048
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:12,520
the backups. This online thing really

5049
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:14,520
has some of the you know I consider

5050
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:16,520
Falco to have always been somebody who's you know been pretty

5051
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:18,520
pretty quick to defend Nintendo and appreciate

5052
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:20,520
Nintendo and you know

5053
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:22,520
it's not just him but I'm picking on him because

5054
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:24,520
of the email at the moment but I feel like a lot of

5055
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:26,520
Nintendo fans out there like this online

5056
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:28,520
thing even the most

5057
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:30,520
heavy Nintendo fans

5058
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:32,520
are having a hard time like sticking up for it

5059
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:34,520
and even saying Nintendo has been making some

5060
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:36,520
pretty shitty decisions with this thing. Like I get

5061
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:38,520
the fence with them like oh we're not

5062
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:40,520
paying a lot of money for it.

5063
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:42,520
Oh it's Nintendo and Nintendo makes good games.

5064
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:44,520
You know what though? Sony makes good

5065
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:46,520
games. Microsoft makes good

5066
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:48,520
games. Lots of companies make good games.

5067
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:50,520
Sony and Microsoft as we have seen

5068
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:52,520
and discussed on the show are also not infallible

5069
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:54,520
to making bad decisions. They're just

5070
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:56,520
bad decisions of a different sort usually.

5071
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:58,520
It's not usually the online thing that's

5072
01:49:58,520 --> 01:50:00,520
well no I take that back because

5073
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:02,520
it's interesting because Microsoft kind of

5074
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:04,520
had Microsoft's big screw

5075
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:06,520
up was really in how they delivered

5076
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:08,520
the message of their online.

5077
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:10,520
I think if they had delivered that message in a

5078
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:12,520
different way we'd be looking at a

5079
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:14,520
completely different like ecosystem of gaming

5080
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:16,520
right now with Xbox One.

5081
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:18,520
If they had delivered the message in the appropriate way

5082
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:20,520
and they could have maybe done that by not firing

5083
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:22,520
their community outreach team but that's another story

5084
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:24,520
that you know is again part of the problem.

5085
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:26,520
But if Microsoft

5086
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:28,520
had maybe delivered that message in a different way

5087
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:30,520
I mean gaming would be so

5088
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:32,520
I think different right now and I don't think Microsoft would have been

5089
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:34,520
the bad guy this last generation as they

5090
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:36,520
kind of ended up being for a time.

5091
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,520
Yeah. It's just

5092
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:40,520
at this point like

5093
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:42,520
like how many times are we going to excuse

5094
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:44,520
them. I'm sorry I'm jumping

5095
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:46,520
because you don't chat says you mean if they lied. No that's

5096
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:48,520
not what I mean. What I said was

5097
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:50,520
if they delivered the message in a different way

5098
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:52,520
I'll repeat that for you so you can hear that because I didn't

5099
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:54,520
mean anything different. Thank you. It's just

5100
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:56,520
at this point like it's kind of

5101
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:58,520
like I get it like oh well we didn't

5102
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:00,520
expect much from Nintendo but

5103
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:02,520
why don't we like like look

5104
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:04,520
at it look at look at their quality of their games

5105
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:06,520
the effort that they put into the software

5106
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,520
that runs on their stuff but they don't put

5107
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:10,520
that same quality into

5108
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:12,520
their networking. I mean like

5109
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:14,520
that's kind of got to be a scar

5110
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:16,520
on their brand because like Nintendo

5111
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:18,520
is Nintendo not Nintendo is only

5112
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:20,520
the games that run on it and only the hardware

5113
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:22,520
but the the networking that's

5114
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:24,520
absolute shit. Well that's

5115
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:26,520
not Nintendo. You know bullshit

5116
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:28,520
that's your fucking company. You got

5117
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:30,520
to you got to put the same effort

5118
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:32,520
into it. And this is ridiculous to not think

5119
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:34,520
of designing your games while we're storing

5120
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:36,520
all the player data locally.

5121
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:38,520
You don't see anything wrong with

5122
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:40,520
that. How

5123
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:42,520
long has networking been a thing

5124
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:44,520
like you know that's like basic shit

5125
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:46,520
that you know that's not what you're supposed

5126
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:48,520
to do. You store it in the cloud so

5127
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:50,520
that they can't be manipulated.

5128
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:52,520
I don't understand how this is

5129
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:54,520
new information to them. It's like they've never

5130
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:56,520
played another console

5131
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:58,520
or never experienced

5132
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:00,520
the world. I mean I don't get it.

5133
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:02,520
Here's the unfortunate thing that's going to happen.

5134
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:04,520
Nintendo is not going to change anything

5135
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:06,520
why because Nintendo Online is going to

5136
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:08,520
is going to sell just fine.

5137
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:10,520
Plenty of people are going to sign up for Nintendo Online

5138
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:12,520
because they want to play Smash Online

5139
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:14,520
they want to play Splatoon Online they want to play Mario Kart Online

5140
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:16,520
they want to play NES Classics even though

5141
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:18,520
we all know it's not as optimal. And that's fine.

5142
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,520
People are going to pay the money and to be

5143
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,520
to be fair it's cheaper than the others

5144
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:24,520
so they're going to pay the money to do all that

5145
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:26,520
online and

5146
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:28,520
Nintendo is not going to be motivated

5147
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:30,520
to change it. And then that's fine. And you know

5148
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:32,520
what it may not be a thing where it

5149
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:34,520
affects them right now. It will

5150
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:36,520
eventually eventually someone they're going to

5151
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:38,520
hit everybody's breaking point to

5152
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:40,520
where it's just going to they're either going to

5153
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,520
fix it and it's going to get better

5154
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:44,520
or they're just going to keep

5155
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:46,520
doing this shit and eventually it's not going to be acceptable

5156
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:48,520
anymore. It's like kind of like with

5157
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:50,520
new phones that come out where

5158
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:52,520
they hardly change anything you know

5159
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:54,520
add a little bit of spit polish

5160
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:56,520
to it and then they charge another two hundred dollars

5161
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,520
on top of what they charged for the phone last year.

5162
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:00,520
I mean it's

5163
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:02,520
eventually some people

5164
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:04,520
will keep upgrading and stuff like that but

5165
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:06,520
eventually it's like OK really

5166
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:08,520
what am I paying for. This isn't that different you know

5167
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:10,520
it's going to end up like that.

5168
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:12,520
Well it's like you know this isn't

5169
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:14,520
really acceptable at this time like I can

5170
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:16,520
get much better. Yeah I'm paying a little bit more

5171
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:18,520
for the service on this

5172
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:20,520
console but I'm getting a lot more

5173
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:22,520
free games. No. Yeah.

5174
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:24,520
Free games and just features

5175
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:26,520
like I'm not even taught like free games aside

5176
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:28,520
let's just pretend we don't even get those stupid NES

5177
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:30,520
games. OK. Share play

5178
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:32,520
is I think is a huge thing that yeah

5179
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:34,520
Sony has no sharing share plays a huge share

5180
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:36,520
plays a huge thing. People don't talk enough

5181
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:38,520
about that. That's a huge deal. But like

5182
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,520
even just like voice chat

5183
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:42,520
on the console to be clear. I've said a lot

5184
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:44,520
of negative stuff about Sony tonight with

5185
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:46,520
the classic and everything but I give

5186
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:48,520
credit where credit is due like that share play

5187
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:50,520
is is truly an amazing

5188
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:52,520
and under talked about feature. It really

5189
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:54,520
does like it allows you to try games

5190
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:56,520
that you don't fucking own.

5191
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:58,520
It's pretty great. I mean just

5192
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:00,520
just like even

5193
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:02,520
basics left like voice chat

5194
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:04,520
using the system not a phone

5195
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:06,520
app. Why the hell do I have to have a phone

5196
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:08,520
app to voice. That's stupid.

5197
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:10,520
That's stupid. Any console

5198
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:12,520
like you don't as Fortnite has demonstrated

5199
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:14,520
you don't exactly

5200
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:16,520
why Nintendo on their own

5201
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:18,520
platform their own product

5202
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:20,520
like they're supposed to be the best at

5203
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:22,520
making games like they're just like fantastic

5204
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:24,520
but yet it's

5205
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:26,520
stupid. It's like who designed

5206
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:28,520
this shit.

5207
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:30,520
Like seriously what

5208
01:54:30,520 --> 01:54:32,520
programmer out there said hey

5209
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:34,520
this is a good fucking idea.

5210
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:38,520
Who did this.

5211
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:42,520
I don't get it. It just doesn't

5212
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:44,520
make any sense. But you

5213
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:46,520
know what. Whatever.

5214
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:48,520
It's just it's gonna be what it is.

5215
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:50,520
It's just gonna be the hassle that we're gonna

5216
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:52,520
have to deal with.

5217
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:54,520
All right.

5218
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:56,520
Bobby Black Wolf in chat

5219
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,520
was point out no programmer said that it

5220
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:00,520
was management. Exactly.

5221
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:02,520
But who let them say that was a good who

5222
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:04,520
ran with that idea though. Like

5223
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:06,520
someone has to say you know what

5224
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:08,520
you see in the modern age that

5225
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:10,520
we're living in that's stupid and no one

5226
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:12,520
does it that way.

5227
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:14,520
And management said I don't

5228
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:16,520
care that's what we're doing says Bobby.

5229
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:18,520
Well

5230
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:20,520
we've we've seen what bad

5231
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:22,520
management can do. But but Nintendo

5232
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:24,520
like the thing is like it's just

5233
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:26,520
it's just not going to stop because for

5234
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:28,520
the reasons I pointed out this

5235
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:30,520
Nintendo online thing is going to do just fine.

5236
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:32,520
They have to fall from their graces in order

5237
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,520
for this shit to happen. It's

5238
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:36,520
what has to happen is that

5239
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:38,520
a kid has to get hurt

5240
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:40,520
somehow due to this. And I

5241
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:42,520
would never advocate for violence against children.

5242
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:44,520
That's not what I'm saying. But I'm just saying you'll notice

5243
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:46,520
Nintendo doesn't do like crazy things and like change

5244
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:48,520
things up until kids could possibly

5245
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:50,520
be in danger. Where are my paper cut stories

5246
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:52,520
from Labo?

5247
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:54,520
That's when things

5248
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:56,520
will change. That's when like

5249
01:55:56,520 --> 01:55:58,520
they're not just going to change it they'll

5250
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:00,520
full on delete it like they did with SwapNote

5251
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:02,520
because kids may be in

5252
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:04,520
danger. So that's

5253
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:06,520
storing files on the

5254
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:08,520
server. What has to happen is that there has to be

5255
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:10,520
like threatening messages to children in

5256
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:12,520
those files for that to stop.

5257
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:14,520
Like we have the friend codes in there.

5258
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:16,520
I hope you know I'm being ridiculous. Like why we have

5259
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:18,520
friend codes in there if voice chat's

5260
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:20,520
going to be turned off. Oh

5261
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:22,520
well it could be a rapist that's

5262
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:24,520
going to try to you know contact them. Then why

5263
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:26,520
have the friend codes in the first place if it's not

5264
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:28,520
going to stop anything. It doesn't

5265
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:30,520
make it stupid. It's just so

5266
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:32,520
many levels of stupid. Okay on

5267
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:34,520
a different note we had a story

5268
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:36,520
that got cut for tonight because in

5269
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:38,520
my mind it wasn't really a story. It was something you posted.

5270
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:40,520
It wasn't really a story. It was somebody sharing

5271
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:42,520
their experiences and they said that they were playing

5272
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:44,520
Mario Kart online

5273
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:46,520
and using the voice chat app when

5274
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:48,520
you would expect that playing online with

5275
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:50,520
strangers is going to be a shit house

5276
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:52,520
as it usually is on Xbox Live

5277
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:54,520
on PlayStation Network is that you hear

5278
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:56,520
all sorts of racial slurs

5279
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:58,520
things against you know

5280
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:00,520
gay slurs things like that

5281
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:02,520
is the type of stuff you hear online. But apparently

5282
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:04,520
some people's

5283
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:06,520
experience on Nintendo's online service

5284
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:08,520
has been very pleasant.

5285
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:10,520
Apparently getting online playing Mario Kart it's like

5286
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:12,520
oh well you know that's

5287
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:14,520
quite the race wasn't it.

5288
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:16,520
Yeah well

5289
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:18,520
we're having a jolly time aren't we.

5290
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:20,520
It's like I just

5291
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:22,520
just have the option where you speak to only

5292
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:24,520
your friends.

5293
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:26,520
But you have friend codes. Apparently talking

5294
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:28,520
to strangers on Nintendo online is not all

5295
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:30,520
bad. Well so is it. You're not there.

5296
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:32,520
As it is as it is on

5297
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:34,520
like Xbox and PlayStation

5298
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:36,520
it's the same everywhere. There's going to be assholes

5299
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:38,520
everywhere. But there's also

5300
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:40,520
not everybody is an asshole

5301
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:42,520
out there like that. That's the thing. Don't just

5302
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:44,520
assume it's going to be shit. If it was

5303
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:46,520
all shit then they wouldn't offer it as a service.

5304
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:50,520
Dark Sakura have you missed your weekly

5305
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:52,520
Nintendo rants by Loki.

5306
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:54,520
It's not that Nintendo rants

5307
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:56,520
stupid if Sony did the same

5308
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:58,520
thing I'd be just as mad at them. It's

5309
01:57:58,520 --> 01:58:00,520
dumb. All right

5310
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:02,520
let's move on. Breathe in

5311
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:04,520
breathe out Loki. We still have some news to cover

5312
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:06,520
before we get to phone calls. Orange launch

5313
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:08,520
radio on Skype. I believe we're done with

5314
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:10,520
emails right. That was the last email. Yeah that was it.

5315
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:12,520
All right. Thank you Flaco for the email.

5316
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:14,520
Look at what you did. All right. Anyway

5317
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:16,520
everybody follow Flaco on

5318
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:18,520
Twitch especially because I can't broadcast right now.

5319
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:20,520
So you should watch Flaco instead. You know

5320
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:22,520
obviously there's many people I recommend on Twitch.

5321
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:24,520
What I'd really recommend. Look at our

5322
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:26,520
Discord server if you go to vognetwork.com

5323
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:28,520
Discord because we have a Twitch channel

5324
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:30,520
where people alert when they're live. And so

5325
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:32,520
I would say watch all those people.

5326
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:34,520
This is fantastic. All right. Let's get back into

5327
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:36,520
some news before we get to some calls. Orange launch

5328
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:38,520
radio on Skype. Loki. So

5329
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:40,520
this week was the big old

5330
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:42,520
Red Dead Redemption 2

5331
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:44,520
media blitz where

5332
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:46,520
they had allowed a lot of the

5333
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:48,520
different outlets out there

5334
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:50,520
to check out the game for a few hours.

5335
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:52,520
Also they talked a little bit about Red Dead

5336
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:54,520
Online which is going to be launching

5337
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:56,520
after the game launches

5338
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:58,520
the following month in November.

5339
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:00,520
They're going to start a public beta.

5340
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:02,520
They basically said as with most online experiences

5341
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:04,520
of this size and scale there will inevitably

5342
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:06,520
be some turbulence at launch.

5343
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:08,520
So they're hoping

5344
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:10,520
that with this beta test that they're

5345
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:12,520
going to help iron those out.

5346
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:14,520
You know

5347
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:16,520
same with

5348
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:18,520
I think Grand Theft Auto 5 had a big

5349
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:20,520
shit show when it came to

5350
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:22,520
Grand Theft Auto Online. Also

5351
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:24,520
what we've learned from the experience when launching online

5352
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:26,520
games at this scale there are bound to be a few

5353
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:28,520
issues and we want to ensure that we have time

5354
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:30,520
to gradually roll out the game and make sure

5355
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:32,520
the experience is as smooth as possible for

5356
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:34,520
everyone that we can. And we believe

5357
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:36,520
this way of rolling out

5358
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:38,520
will give people the best overall experience

5359
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:40,520
both single player and multiplayer.

5360
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:42,520
And from what I hear the game

5361
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:44,520
the online portion is supposed to be pretty similar to Red Dead

5362
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:46,520
Redemption

5363
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:48,520
the multiplayer in that game

5364
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:50,520
which is actually pretty fun. I did play

5365
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:52,520
quite a bit of that. It was one

5366
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:54,520
of the games that did support System

5367
01:59:54,520 --> 01:59:56,520
Link at the time so we ended up

5368
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:58,520
playing that quite a bit but it was fun

5369
01:59:58,520 --> 02:00:00,520
there's the kind of free roam and do all that.

5370
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:02,520
I'm

5371
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:04,520
I can't wait to check it out though.

5372
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:06,520
It sounds pretty cool.

5373
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:08,520
It looks pretty.

5374
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:10,520
And because

5375
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:12,520
of all these media outlets and talking about the

5376
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:14,520
detail because I remember the one thing with Grand Theft Auto 5

5377
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:16,520
was the level of detail and

5378
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:18,520
the one thing that stood out with me of course

5379
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:20,520
because someone's going to ask that

5380
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:22,520
they asked about the horse testicle

5381
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:24,520
physics. Oh good god.

5382
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:26,520
And apparently yes there are

5383
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:28,520
horse testicle physics and not only

5384
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:30,520
are there horse testicle physics

5385
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:32,520
but they even went so far as

5386
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:34,520
when your horse is walking through

5387
02:00:34,520 --> 02:00:36,520
wintery environment the testicles actually

5388
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:38,520
shrink and expand and compare

5389
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:40,520
depending on the heat.

5390
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:42,520
That is some level of detail right there.

5391
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:44,520
I appreciate

5392
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:46,520
attention to detail.

5393
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:48,520
OK. But I want to know

5394
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:50,520
because look here's my

5395
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:52,520
thing with horses. Whenever you

5396
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:54,520
watch horses like you'll see the horses at

5397
02:00:54,520 --> 02:00:56,520
Disneyland you'll see the horses in a parade.

5398
02:00:56,520 --> 02:00:58,520
Everybody sees the horses in a parade. You know what

5399
02:00:58,520 --> 02:01:00,520
I associate those horses with? The fact

5400
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:02,520
that right when they get in front of where you're watching they take

5401
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:04,520
a gigantic fucking dump.

5402
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:06,520
They probably will do that.

5403
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:08,520
Well the horses in Red Dead

5404
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:10,520
Redemption just like is it that thing

5405
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:12,520
if you go too long without moving the controller

5406
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:14,520
like you know how like idle animation

5407
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:16,520
they might tap the screen like you know the whole thing

5408
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:18,520
does the horse like if you just stand there for too long does the horse

5409
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:20,520
just take a massive shit on the ground?

5410
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:22,520
I don't know. Because it's bored.

5411
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:24,520
But it just

5412
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:26,520
that I can only imagine the level

5413
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:28,520
of detail in the game is going to be incredible

5414
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:30,520
just because in Grand Theft Auto 5

5415
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:32,520
is incredible and it's been so many years after that

5416
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:34,520
so I

5417
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:36,520
can't wait. Bobby Blackwolf

5418
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:38,520
in chat says imagine marching behind them in a band.

5419
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:40,520
I have. I was a marching band in high school

5420
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:42,520
and they used to tell us like well if

5421
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:44,520
that happens you just got to march right through

5422
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:46,520
it and no we marched around

5423
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:48,520
it. No. Sorry.

5424
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:50,520
Like you know oh the team's going to lose points.

5425
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:52,520
I'm not going to step in that. No I won't be

5426
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:54,520
doing that today. Let's see.

5427
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:56,520
And Brad from Pod Culture confirms

5428
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:58,520
there is horse crapping in Red Dead Redemption 2.

5429
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:00,520
Oh. Oh happy day.

5430
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:02,520
Hooray.

5431
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:04,520
It's so realistic.

5432
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:06,520
Mmhmm.

5433
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:08,520
I just. I'm just

5434
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:10,520
waiting for somebody to ask. I'm watching

5435
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:12,520
chat like a hawk. I'm waiting for somebody

5436
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,520
to ask.

5437
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:16,520
Can you

5438
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:18,520
fuck the horse?

5439
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:20,520
Can you

5440
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:22,520
Can you

5441
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:24,520
be a horse fucker?

5442
02:02:24,520 --> 02:02:26,520
No.

5443
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:28,520
Can you eat the horse?

5444
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:30,520
Apparently horse is supposed to be

5445
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:32,520
pretty delicious.

5446
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:34,520
Alright moving on.

5447
02:02:34,520 --> 02:02:36,520
Hey let's talk.

5448
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:38,520
Dartitsia said they'll probably be a PC mod for that.

5449
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:40,520
You're right. No it'll never come out on PC

5450
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:42,520
apparently they said. So it's never

5451
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:44,520
come out. Sure. Red Dead Redemption 1 never

5452
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:46,520
came out on PC. Oh I guess that's

5453
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:48,520
true. So they said it's never coming out on

5454
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:50,520
PC. Alright.

5455
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:52,520
Anyhow let's talk about something that will be

5456
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:54,520
coming out on PC and something very different from

5457
02:02:54,520 --> 02:02:56,520
horse shitting and fucking dicks.

5458
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:58,520
There is no

5459
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:00,520
way that you can make pinball

5460
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:02,520
nasty. That's right pinball

5461
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:04,520
is a wholesome family fucking. Until now with

5462
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:06,520
horse fucker the table.

5463
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:08,520
There have been some adult themed

5464
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:10,520
pinball tables. Alright alright. Let's go

5465
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:12,520
from one balls to another.

5466
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:14,520
Talking about pinball. We've

5467
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:16,520
talked in the past few weeks on the show about how

5468
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:18,520
Zen Studios got the

5469
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:20,520
Williams table. That should have been one of the

5470
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:22,520
stories I put in the poll to ask you about

5471
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:24,520
Dartitsia. But Zen Studios is getting that

5472
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:26,520
license from pinball

5473
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:28,520
excuse me from

5474
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:30,520
Farsight excuse me who had the

5475
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:32,520
Williams

5476
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:34,520
and Bally license before.

5477
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:36,520
We know Zen Studios got that.

5478
02:03:36,520 --> 02:03:38,520
And they've been testing. I actually

5479
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:40,520
did the beta test in

5480
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:42,520
Steam. You can turn it on and you can play

5481
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:44,520
a demo

5482
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:46,520
demo table and they're gonna make this table

5483
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:48,520
free for everybody. The

5484
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:50,520
Fish Tales is the table that

5485
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:52,520
will be like the free for

5486
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:54,520
everybody to get you to download the game and

5487
02:03:54,520 --> 02:03:56,520
check it out. And then if you wanna get

5488
02:03:56,520 --> 02:03:58,520
more tables you'll be able to get

5489
02:03:58,520 --> 02:04:00,520
the very first pack volume 1

5490
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:02,520
on October 9th will

5491
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:04,520
include Medieval Madness

5492
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:06,520
Junkyard and the Getaway

5493
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:08,520
High Speed 2. It will set you back

5494
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:10,520
9.99. That's 9.99

5495
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:12,520
US dollars. 9.99

5496
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:14,520
euros. It will

5497
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:16,520
be free. Fish Tales

5498
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:18,520
will be free and the other games will

5499
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:20,520
cost you. It's going to be out on Nintendo Switch,

5500
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:22,520
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows 10

5501
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:24,520
Steam and Zen Pinball

5502
02:04:24,520 --> 02:04:26,520
2 on the Mac.

5503
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:28,520
So even though Pinball FX3 never came out on

5504
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:30,520
the Mac, Zen Pinball 2 on the

5505
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:32,520
Mac will support these. That's kinda interesting how they

5506
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:34,520
did that. So there you go.

5507
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:36,520
I don't know if any of you are gonna

5508
02:04:36,520 --> 02:04:38,520
check that out. I

5509
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:40,520
you know those tables are okay. I mean

5510
02:04:40,520 --> 02:04:42,520
Medieval Madness is kind of a classic. I'm not a fan. I've got

5511
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:44,520
Medieval Madness in my house. I know.

5512
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:46,520
You're not a fan of the emulated because you're so

5513
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:48,520
attached to the real thing. Yeah.

5514
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:50,520
But Fish Tales also isn't very fun to me.

5515
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:52,520
For those of us that can't afford the real thing though.

5516
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:54,520
This is

5517
02:04:54,520 --> 02:04:56,520
an okay substitute. But I really

5518
02:04:56,520 --> 02:04:58,520
Pinball is the one I really want. That's my favorite.

5519
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:00,520
You may be selling Getaway.

5520
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:02,520
Oh really? Wow.

5521
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:04,520
If you're interested. Nah, I don't know.

5522
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:06,520
This house has enough shit in it.

5523
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:08,520
I'll say if I can get rid of three Pinball

5524
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:10,520
machine size things worth of shit then

5525
02:05:10,520 --> 02:05:12,520
I'll allow a Pinball machine in here.

5526
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:14,520
We'll see.

5527
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:16,520
Alright. Let's move on.

5528
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:18,520
Darcyra. Well

5529
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:20,520
there is a new cause

5530
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:22,520
of divorce in this

5531
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:24,520
country and it's called Fortnite.

5532
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:26,520
More than 200

5533
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:28,520
UK couples filed for divorce

5534
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:30,520
in 2018.

5535
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:32,520
And they cited addiction to Fortnite

5536
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:34,520
as their reason for divorce.

5537
02:05:34,520 --> 02:05:36,520
If that's all it took to cause

5538
02:05:36,520 --> 02:05:38,520
a divorce then somebody in that family

5539
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:40,520
was boring the shit out of the other

5540
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:42,520
person in that family.

5541
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:44,520
But that's

5542
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:46,520
actually about 5% of

5543
02:05:46,520 --> 02:05:48,520
the 4,665

5544
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:50,520
petitions that

5545
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:52,520
Divorce Online has

5546
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:54,520
handled. It's actually

5547
02:05:54,520 --> 02:05:56,520
a UK company that offers divorce

5548
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:58,520
services.

5549
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:00,520
And that seems to be the

5550
02:06:00,520 --> 02:06:02,520
biggest one that came up.

5551
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:04,520
And this is also

5552
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:06,520
going hand in hand with the World Health Organization

5553
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:08,520
saying compulsive video game playing now

5554
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:10,520
constitutes a mental

5555
02:06:10,520 --> 02:06:12,520
health condition.

5556
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:14,520
Um.

5557
02:06:14,520 --> 02:06:16,520
Yeah.

5558
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:18,520
I don't know. I mean

5559
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:20,520
if you want to pick an excuse I guess

5560
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:22,520
that's as good as any. You could just say

5561
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:24,520
we don't do anything

5562
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:26,520
together. We don't communicate. We don't

5563
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:28,520
leave the house.

5564
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:30,520
So. That's kind of what Kaijuto is

5565
02:06:30,520 --> 02:06:32,520
referencing in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

5566
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:34,520
says I'm sure they had problems

5567
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:36,520
before Fortnite.

5568
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:38,520
So maybe Fortnite is just kind of like the

5569
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:40,520
objectification

5570
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:42,520
of all those things into one

5571
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:44,520
sort of tangible thing.

5572
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:46,520
I don't know. Fifth Dream in chat says

5573
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:48,520
I'd divorce anyone who likes Fortnite too.

5574
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:50,520
Now now Fifth Dream. It's a very very

5575
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:52,520
popular game. There's many people to play it.

5576
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:54,520
Alright.

5577
02:06:54,520 --> 02:06:56,520
Well it's

5578
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:58,520
always interesting when video games

5579
02:06:58,520 --> 02:07:00,520
get into other parts

5580
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:02,520
of life like that. So.

5581
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:04,520
I wonder what we'll be seeing on the divorce

5582
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:06,520
court. The TV show

5583
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:08,520
Divorce of My Man because he plays too much

5584
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:10,520
Fortnite. S.S.J. remembers

5585
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:12,520
S2100 Matt in our chat says

5586
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:14,520
remember when World of Warcraft was the cause

5587
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:16,520
of divorces back in the day.

5588
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:18,520
Remember the good old days Dark Sakura when it was

5589
02:07:18,520 --> 02:07:20,520
my husband.

5590
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:22,520
My husband plays a horde

5591
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:24,520
and I just can't marry a man because I'm

5592
02:07:24,520 --> 02:07:26,520
I'm an alliance character.

5593
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:28,520
They had like wow widows.

5594
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:30,520
Oh yeah. That's what Victoria always

5595
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:32,520
claimed to be herself was a wow widow.

5596
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:34,520
When she had dated

5597
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:36,520
that guy who was too busy as she

5598
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:38,520
said storming the castle. That's what she called

5599
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:40,520
raiding. He was too busy to go out because he was always

5600
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:42,520
storming the castle with his friends. I just think of

5601
02:07:42,520 --> 02:07:44,520
the princess bride like that. Me too

5602
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:46,520
but that's kind of what it is. Bye bye boys.

5603
02:07:46,520 --> 02:07:48,520
Have fun storming the castle.

5604
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:50,520
That's what raiding is. You're storming the castle

5605
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:52,520
with your friends. Alright

5606
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:54,520
anyway. Let's move on. A few more

5607
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:56,520
stories for you guys before the Skype line.

5608
02:07:56,520 --> 02:07:58,520
Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype.

5609
02:07:58,520 --> 02:08:00,520
Loki pretty big story here towards the end.

5610
02:08:00,520 --> 02:08:02,520
Yes so we kind of

5611
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:04,520
alluded to it a couple weeks ago

5612
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:06,520
talking about that there was a rumor that you're

5613
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:08,520
going to be able to start downloading titles

5614
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:10,520
as part of PlayStation Now which has always

5615
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:12,520
been my gripe because PlayStation Now I think

5616
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:14,520
is a terrible service

5617
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:16,520
as far as having to stream all the time

5618
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:18,520
and I wish they would let you download it like

5619
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:20,520
you know you can with games pass

5620
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:22,520
but now apparently you can with

5621
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:24,520
most of the titles on there

5622
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:26,520
and they're going to be starting I guess with

5623
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:28,520
almost all of the PlayStation 4 games

5624
02:08:28,520 --> 02:08:30,520
in the service including Bloodborne,

5625
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:32,520
God of War 3 remastered, NBA 2K16

5626
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:34,520
and Until Dawn will be available for

5627
02:08:34,520 --> 02:08:36,520
download in addition

5628
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:38,520
to the PlayStation Now lineup

5629
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:40,520
of classic PlayStation 2 games

5630
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:42,520
that they remastered for PlayStation 4

5631
02:08:42,520 --> 02:08:44,520
and then they said they've

5632
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:46,520
they'll be rolling out that feature to

5633
02:08:46,520 --> 02:08:48,520
PlayStation Now subscribers over the next few days

5634
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:50,520
so if you don't see it

5635
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:52,520
just check back later.

5636
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:54,520
A lot of people very happy about this change

5637
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:56,520
that Sony was kind of pressured to do so

5638
02:08:56,520 --> 02:08:58,520
in response to Microsoft's system allowing you to

5639
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:00,520
do this. Yeah and

5640
02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:02,520
like you know you still have to phone in

5641
02:09:02,520 --> 02:09:04,520
every once in a while to you know so you can't

5642
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:06,520
play offline for a long time but it's

5643
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:08,520
still nice to have

5644
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:10,520
that option. Still don't want to

5645
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:12,520
play the service though because

5646
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:14,520
a lot of the games that are in there I already

5647
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:16,520
own and

5648
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:18,520
yeah. Fifth Dream says

5649
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:20,520
and they will take advantage of PS4 Pro

5650
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:22,520
hardware. That's good.

5651
02:09:22,520 --> 02:09:24,520
Is PS4 Pro

5652
02:09:24,520 --> 02:09:26,520
kind of the default now? Do you still get

5653
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:28,520
regular PlayStations that aren't Pro anymore?

5654
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:30,520
I guess you probably still do. Yeah they do.

5655
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:32,520
I would imagine at some point PlayStation 4 Pro

5656
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:34,520
would just be the default. Someday

5657
02:09:34,520 --> 02:09:36,520
but it has to come down in price

5658
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:38,520
I think. Yeah that's true. And

5659
02:09:38,520 --> 02:09:40,520
they still do that with the Xbox too. The Xbox

5660
02:09:40,520 --> 02:09:42,520
One and S and X.

5661
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:44,520
Alright

5662
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:46,520
well finally here tonight before we

5663
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:48,520
go to our Skype line at Orange Launch Radio

5664
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:50,520
all one word on Skype although I'll ask if there's any

5665
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:52,520
last minute stories as well. We do have a couple

5666
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:54,520
stories here about game companies who have

5667
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:56,520
helped to fulfill some final wishes

5668
02:09:56,520 --> 02:09:58,520
of younger folks

5669
02:09:58,520 --> 02:10:00,520
that are suffering with

5670
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:02,520
some different diseases and it's kind of one of those things

5671
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:04,520
where it's like ah man these are real like

5672
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:06,520
you know just bad situations

5673
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:08,520
and unfortunate but it's really cool

5674
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:10,520
that these gaming companies are helping

5675
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:12,520
these gaming fans

5676
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:14,520
in their last days to be able to

5677
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:16,520
play the games that they really want to play.

5678
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:18,520
The first story I have here has to do with Bethesda

5679
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:20,520
who showed up when

5680
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:22,520
a 12 year old boy who had a rare form

5681
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:24,520
of cancer wanted to play Fallout

5682
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:26,520
76. The kid was from

5683
02:10:26,520 --> 02:10:28,520
Hampton Roads, Virginia. He was battling

5684
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:30,520
stage 4 neuroblastoma

5685
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:32,520
for half his life. He was diagnosed at 5 years old.

5686
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:34,520
Doctors have

5687
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:36,520
stopped his treatment but

5688
02:10:36,520 --> 02:10:38,520
then he realized he probably would not get to play Fallout

5689
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:40,520
76 which is due in November.

5690
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:42,520
And I realize you could probably say some

5691
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:44,520
stuff here because I think Fallout is an M rated

5692
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:46,520
series and he's a 12 year old kid but you know

5693
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:48,520
what? That

5694
02:10:48,520 --> 02:10:50,520
that's the family's decision to make not yours.

5695
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:52,520
So he wanted to play Fallout 76

5696
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:54,520
and apparently

5697
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:56,520
the assistant director at Bethesda actually

5698
02:10:56,520 --> 02:10:58,520
drove 4 hours from the company's

5699
02:10:58,520 --> 02:11:00,520
headquarters in Maryland to the family

5700
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:02,520
home with a copy of the game and

5701
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:04,520
a prototype of the power

5702
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:06,520
armor helmet that's going to come with that

5703
02:11:06,520 --> 02:11:08,520
super special edition of the game

5704
02:11:08,520 --> 02:11:10,520
signed by the chief of Bethesda

5705
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:12,520
game studios Todd Howard.

5706
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:14,520
So unfortunately he didn't get to keep

5707
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:16,520
the game because it's just too early

5708
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:18,520
and to be fair in

5709
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:20,520
these situations if it is

5710
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:22,520
out there in the media that somebody has

5711
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:24,520
something super special like this it makes

5712
02:11:24,520 --> 02:11:26,520
you a target for thieves

5713
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:28,520
and so it's not that Bethesda's trying to

5714
02:11:28,520 --> 02:11:30,520
be dicks by just not letting the kid keep

5715
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:32,520
the game but it's actually risky

5716
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:34,520
to let him keep it if you really

5717
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:36,520
kind of critically think about it. It's

5718
02:11:36,520 --> 02:11:38,520
it's an unfortunate thing but that's

5719
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:40,520
what it is.

5720
02:11:40,520 --> 02:11:42,520
So anyway even though he didn't get to keep

5721
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:44,520
the game still the hours of playtime

5722
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:46,520
made him happy and they were all very

5723
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:48,520
very very happy to

5724
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:50,520
make the wish come true and all that stuff and

5725
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:52,520
the kid got to play the game so

5726
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:54,520
that's really cool. There is a GoFundMe out there

5727
02:11:54,520 --> 02:11:56,520
for Wes trying to raise money to pay

5728
02:11:56,520 --> 02:11:58,520
living expenses and trying to get the

5729
02:11:58,520 --> 02:12:00,520
doctors in New York City and all this.

5730
02:12:00,520 --> 02:12:02,520
So our thoughts with

5731
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:04,520
him and

5732
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:06,520
kind of a similar story here. This time

5733
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:08,520
Nintendo allowing a fan

5734
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:10,520
to play Super Smash Brothers

5735
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:12,520
Ultimate. This guy is a little

5736
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:14,520
older. He's in his early 20s so he's

5737
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:16,520
not a kid per se but he's got his own

5738
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:18,520
Twitter account and everything. Chris Taylor

5739
02:12:18,520 --> 02:12:20,520
a big fan of Smash Brothers and he

5740
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:22,520
also kind of you know he's battling

5741
02:12:22,520 --> 02:12:24,520
cancer as well and even though

5742
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:26,520
he's beat cancer twice before he's being

5743
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:28,520
told that it's terminal and he recently wanted

5744
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:30,520
recently made the tough decision

5745
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:32,520
to stop treatment for that

5746
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:34,520
but kind of realized that oh I

5747
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:36,520
I may not get to play Super Smash

5748
02:12:36,520 --> 02:12:38,520
Brothers Ultimate. So there was a

5749
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:40,520
big you know push online like

5750
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:42,520
gaming subreddits and you know people

5751
02:12:42,520 --> 02:12:44,520
trying to amplify this his wish

5752
02:12:44,520 --> 02:12:46,520
to be able to play this and

5753
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:48,520
what happened? Nintendo flew

5754
02:12:48,520 --> 02:12:50,520
out an E3 demo of the

5755
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:52,520
game to him

5756
02:12:52,520 --> 02:12:54,520
earlier this week and

5757
02:12:54,520 --> 02:12:56,520
he got to play the game for three hours. They

5758
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:58,520
took some pictures and you can see some of

5759
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:00,520
this on Twitter on his

5760
02:13:00,520 --> 02:13:02,520
Twitter. He's a spooky wubler on Twitter

5761
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:04,520
and you can see some of the pictures and

5762
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:06,520
you know again some people are like well why didn't they

5763
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:08,520
why did he only get to play the E3 demo?

5764
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:10,520
Why didn't he get to play the full game? Game's not done

5765
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:12,520
yet. Well yeah for one the game's not

5766
02:13:12,520 --> 02:13:14,520
done yet for two

5767
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:16,520
you know again same things I mentioned before is

5768
02:13:16,520 --> 02:13:18,520
that when those types of things are in the hands

5769
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:20,520
you know and people know about it because

5770
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:22,520
of social media in fact

5771
02:13:22,520 --> 02:13:24,520
he couldn't announce that this was happening

5772
02:13:24,520 --> 02:13:26,520
until they already left

5773
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:28,520
and again it's because you

5774
02:13:28,520 --> 02:13:30,520
know it would make you potentially a

5775
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:32,520
target for thievery and all this other stuff

5776
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:34,520
which really it's unfortunate but anyway

5777
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:36,520
very cool that these gaming companies

5778
02:13:36,520 --> 02:13:38,520
are helping to make some

5779
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:40,520
wishes come true and lots of

5780
02:13:40,520 --> 02:13:42,520
people in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

5781
02:13:42,520 --> 02:13:44,520
giving a hearty

5782
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:46,520
hashtag fuck cancer in our chat

5783
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:48,520
and I agree but

5784
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:50,520
I'm you know despite

5785
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:52,520
the situation

5786
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:54,520
I'm glad these gaming companies are

5787
02:13:54,520 --> 02:13:56,520
able to you know

5788
02:13:56,520 --> 02:13:58,520
help these folks out and let them play

5789
02:13:58,520 --> 02:14:00,520
what they want to play. Okay

5790
02:14:00,520 --> 02:14:02,520

Yeah. Alright

5804
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:30,520

02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:38,520
yeah how are things going with

5809
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:40,520
you know we didn't get asked

5810
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:42,520
to ask a lot about this but I know sundays are also

5811
02:14:42,520 --> 02:14:44,520
a big thing for your sisters

5812
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:46,520
our general meeting is every

02:14:46,520 --> 02:14:48,520
fourth sunday

5814
02:14:48,520 --> 02:14:50,520
so I was up

5815
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:52,520
way early this morning to go to the

5816
02:14:52,520 --> 02:14:54,520
sisters meeting had to leave that

5817
02:14:54,520 --> 02:14:56,520
fifteen minutes early to get

5818
02:14:56,520 --> 02:14:58,520
to work where

5819
02:14:58,520 --> 02:15:00,520
my

5820
02:15:00,520 --> 02:15:02,520
provisioning at my job had been

5821
02:15:02,520 --> 02:15:04,520
messed up so I didn't take any

5822
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:06,520
calls today I did nothing but training

5823
02:15:06,520 --> 02:15:08,520
I was bored then I

5824
02:15:08,520 --> 02:15:10,520
left and now you're here

5825
02:15:10,520 --> 02:15:12,520
yes so you had a very busy day

5826
02:15:12,520 --> 02:15:14,520
hopefully I'll be able to make

5827
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:16,520
I'll be able to perfect my pumpkin

5828
02:15:16,520 --> 02:15:18,520
bread not like a sweet bread

5829
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:20,520
I'm planning on making a savory pumpkin

5830
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:22,520
and that'll be the time where nobody can bitch about

5831
02:15:22,520 --> 02:15:24,520
the pumpkin stuff too because that'll be right around

5832
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:26,520
Halloween when you're here next that'll be Halloween

5833
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:28,520
weekend right October 28th will be that show

5834
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:30,520
I think well I like savory

5835
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:32,520
gourd stuff you know

5836
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:34,520
like pumpkins and butternut squashes and stuff

5837
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:36,520
like that I like it savory and buttery

5838
02:15:36,520 --> 02:15:38,520
and I've got my bread recipe

5839
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:40,520
down like I can't bake cookies

5840
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:42,520
and all that for shit but I can bake

5841
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:44,520
bread some of the savory pumpkin

5842
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:46,520
stuff's really good like we get this pumpkin

5843
02:15:46,520 --> 02:15:48,520
ravioli this time of year at Trader Joe's

5844
02:15:48,520 --> 02:15:50,520
it's really good so I think what I

5845
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:52,520
do is just get like the pumpkin pulp

5846
02:15:52,520 --> 02:15:54,520
and spiral it in

5847
02:15:54,520 --> 02:15:56,520
in my dough and then

5848
02:15:56,520 --> 02:15:58,520
just let it bake from inside the dough

5849
02:15:58,520 --> 02:16:00,520
I think that would be good

5850
02:16:00,520 --> 02:16:02,520
and then just make it buttery and savory

5851
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:04,520
again the Skype line is open hopefully somebody

5852
02:16:04,520 --> 02:16:06,520
will call but if not then not

5853
02:16:06,520 --> 02:16:08,520
Orange Tons Radio all one word on

5854
02:16:08,520 --> 02:16:10,520
Skype if you want to get through on the Skype line tonight

5855
02:16:10,520 --> 02:16:12,520
I'm not that intimidating boys

5856
02:16:12,520 --> 02:16:14,520
I will not be doing a live feed after the show tonight

5857
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:16,520
because again I'm still limited with my

5858
02:16:16,520 --> 02:16:18,520
upload I do hope to get that fixed

5859
02:16:18,520 --> 02:16:20,520
I have my gears turning in my

5860
02:16:20,520 --> 02:16:22,520
head about some projects that I

5861
02:16:22,520 --> 02:16:24,520
might work on so stay tuned to my Twitch channel

5862
02:16:24,520 --> 02:16:26,520
at Rob Roberts I may

5863
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:28,520
try some experiments with video

5864
02:16:28,520 --> 02:16:30,520
premieres this week and see what you guys like

5865
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:32,520
what gets attention and what nobody

5866
02:16:32,520 --> 02:16:34,520
seems to care about also apparently today

5867
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:36,520
is the 129th

5868
02:16:36,520 --> 02:16:38,520
anniversary of Nintendo

5869
02:16:38,520 --> 02:16:40,520
oh right because they started as a playing card

5870
02:16:40,520 --> 02:16:42,520
company way way way back in the day they were not always

5871
02:16:42,520 --> 02:16:44,520
about what's that

5872
02:16:44,520 --> 02:16:46,520
oh right the specific type

5873
02:16:46,520 --> 02:16:48,520
of not like Jack of Clubs

5874
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:50,520
King of Hearts those type of playing

5875
02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:52,520
cards but a very specific type of

5876
02:16:52,520 --> 02:16:54,520
card so Nintendo was not

5877
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:56,520
always about electronics that's just kind of

5878
02:16:56,520 --> 02:16:58,520
what it turned into and what they're most known

5879
02:16:58,520 --> 02:17:00,520
for now we do have a call coming in

5880
02:17:00,520 --> 02:17:02,520
let's get to it hi you're on Orange Tons Radio who's

5881
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:04,520
this hey this is Akdeft

5882
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:06,520
hey Akdeft it's good to hear from you buddy

5883
02:17:06,520 --> 02:17:08,520
what's up

5884
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:10,520
well I do want to talk about

5885
02:17:10,520 --> 02:17:12,520
the PlayStation Classic

5886
02:17:12,520 --> 02:17:14,520
okay what are your thoughts on it

5887
02:17:14,520 --> 02:17:16,520
it's kind of stupid

5888
02:17:16,520 --> 02:17:18,520
why you say that

5889
02:17:18,520 --> 02:17:20,520
you know there's a lot of people that would be very excited

5890
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:22,520
about this why do you say it's crap

5891
02:17:22,520 --> 02:17:24,520
well

5892
02:17:24,520 --> 02:17:26,520
mostly I thought it was a good

5893
02:17:26,520 --> 02:17:28,520
idea it is

5894
02:17:28,520 --> 02:17:30,520
a good idea but

5895
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:32,520
at the same time Sony's doing

5896
02:17:32,520 --> 02:17:34,520
a lot of stuff that

5897
02:17:34,520 --> 02:17:36,520
makes my head baffle like

5898
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:38,520
like really aside

5899
02:17:38,520 --> 02:17:40,520
the fact it

5900
02:17:40,520 --> 02:17:42,520
doesn't have like an AC adapter

5901
02:17:42,520 --> 02:17:44,520
because yeah it's

5902
02:17:44,520 --> 02:17:46,520
probably it's gonna be like a

5903
02:17:46,520 --> 02:17:48,520
phone adapter and mostly like

5904
02:17:48,520 --> 02:17:50,520
the SNES or

5905
02:17:50,520 --> 02:17:52,520
NES Mini

5906
02:17:52,520 --> 02:17:54,520
but the fact that the controllers

5907
02:17:54,520 --> 02:17:56,520
aren't DualShock it's like

5908
02:17:56,520 --> 02:17:58,520
one of the first things that

5909
02:17:58,520 --> 02:18:00,520
I really don't know what

5910
02:18:00,520 --> 02:18:02,520
Sony is thinking

5911
02:18:04,520 --> 02:18:06,520
is it like

5912
02:18:06,520 --> 02:18:08,520
the game selection or is it just the price

5913
02:18:08,520 --> 02:18:10,520
what is it that's like turning you off

5914
02:18:10,520 --> 02:18:12,520
to this

5915
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:14,520
so again the first thing is

5916
02:18:14,520 --> 02:18:16,520
the controllers like

5917
02:18:16,520 --> 02:18:18,520
they should be DualShocks

5918
02:18:18,520 --> 02:18:20,520
like really I don't know why

5919
02:18:20,520 --> 02:18:22,520
Sony is making those

5920
02:18:22,520 --> 02:18:24,520
yeah I don't disagree with that

5921
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:26,520
that's for sure I sure don't disagree with that

5922
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:28,520
but yeah the price point

5923
02:18:28,520 --> 02:18:30,520
I would agree with it

5924
02:18:30,520 --> 02:18:32,520
if it had like at least

5925
02:18:32,520 --> 02:18:34,520
five more games

5926
02:18:34,520 --> 02:18:36,520
if it had a DualShock if it had the AC

5927
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:38,520
adapter

5928
02:18:38,520 --> 02:18:40,520
but I really don't know

5929
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:42,520
in the game selection

5930
02:18:42,520 --> 02:18:44,520
for 20 games for a classic

5931
02:18:44,520 --> 02:18:46,520
system like this

5932
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:48,520
seems like really

5933
02:18:48,520 --> 02:18:50,520
really low and I understand

5934
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:52,520
that the SNES

5935
02:18:52,520 --> 02:18:54,520
Mini also has only

5936
02:18:54,520 --> 02:18:56,520
20 or 21 games

5937
02:18:56,520 --> 02:18:58,520
but those are all

5938
02:18:58,520 --> 02:19:00,520
classics like in this case

5939
02:19:00,520 --> 02:19:02,520
of the five they have announced

5940
02:19:02,520 --> 02:19:04,520
only

5941
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:06,520
like well a side

5942
02:19:06,520 --> 02:19:08,520
Final Fantasy and maybe

5943
02:19:08,520 --> 02:19:10,520
Tekken 3

5944
02:19:10,520 --> 02:19:12,520
the other the rest aren't

5945
02:19:12,520 --> 02:19:14,520
that like

5946
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:16,520
popular even something

5947
02:19:16,520 --> 02:19:18,520
like Ridge Racer

5948
02:19:18,520 --> 02:19:20,520
I don't think many people are

5949
02:19:20,520 --> 02:19:22,520
excited about it and something like

5950
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:24,520
Jumping Flash that personally I

5951
02:19:24,520 --> 02:19:26,520
like it isn't

5952
02:19:26,520 --> 02:19:28,520
that great of a game and not many

5953
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:30,520
people like even like it so

5954
02:19:30,520 --> 02:19:32,520
I really don't know

5955
02:19:32,520 --> 02:19:34,520
what Sony is thinking about this

5956
02:19:34,520 --> 02:19:36,520
console or what's the idea

5957
02:19:36,520 --> 02:19:38,520
Well they're thinking

5958
02:19:38,520 --> 02:19:40,520
how can we make money? How did our

5959
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:42,520
competition make money? Oh we can do that

5960
02:19:42,520 --> 02:19:44,520
so I just

5961
02:19:44,520 --> 02:19:46,520
I still sort of think that they could have

5962
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:48,520
you know really shown the value

5963
02:19:48,520 --> 02:19:50,520
of making people

5964
02:19:50,520 --> 02:19:52,520
or enticing people to buy a PlayStation

5965
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:54,520
4 because oh you already

5966
02:19:54,520 --> 02:19:56,520
have this old library of games that will

5967
02:19:56,520 --> 02:19:58,520
automatically work on this new system

5968
02:19:58,520 --> 02:20:00,520
so feel free to get rid of your old

5969
02:20:00,520 --> 02:20:02,520
system by buying this new system that will play

5970
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:04,520
all of your old games and I get

5971
02:20:04,520 --> 02:20:06,520
like again I get that the chipset

5972
02:20:06,520 --> 02:20:08,520
changes and those changes that happen

5973
02:20:08,520 --> 02:20:10,520
within the system especially make this very

5974
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:12,520
hard with the PlayStation 3

5975
02:20:12,520 --> 02:20:14,520
although I still think they could have got around it with

5976
02:20:14,520 --> 02:20:16,520
PlayStation now but whatever

5977
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:18,520
they didn't want to allocate that type of server

5978
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:20,520
bandwidth and all that stuff but you know

5979
02:20:20,520 --> 02:20:22,520
at least the PlayStation 1 and 2 stuff you

5980
02:20:22,520 --> 02:20:24,520
would think would still be able to work but

5981
02:20:24,520 --> 02:20:26,520
Sony just doesn't see the value

5982
02:20:26,520 --> 02:20:28,520
in that and so this is

5983
02:20:28,520 --> 02:20:30,520
what they're deciding to do instead so

5984
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:32,520
it is what it is so you have to

5985
02:20:32,520 --> 02:20:34,520
make a choice if you want to support it

5986
02:20:34,520 --> 02:20:36,520
and to be fair

5987
02:20:36,520 --> 02:20:38,520
you know it is a cute little thing

5988
02:20:38,520 --> 02:20:40,520
just like the little NES classic

5989
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:42,520
NES it's cute it's something

5990
02:20:42,520 --> 02:20:44,520
that I like for the look of it and not just

5991
02:20:44,520 --> 02:20:46,520
what's inside of it but I do have to

5992
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:48,520
admit in retrospect you know now

5993
02:20:48,520 --> 02:20:50,520
that I've played the Switch Online one it's like

5994
02:20:50,520 --> 02:20:52,520
eh was it $60

5995
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:54,520
cute I don't know so I think

5996
02:20:54,520 --> 02:20:56,520
I think in some ways some of that is almost making me

5997
02:20:56,520 --> 02:20:58,520
hesitate when it comes to wanting

5998
02:20:58,520 --> 02:21:00,520
to get like a classic Sony system

5999
02:21:00,520 --> 02:21:02,520
I don't know

6000
02:21:02,520 --> 02:21:04,520
and that's the thing

6001
02:21:04,520 --> 02:21:06,520
like I really like want

6002
02:21:06,520 --> 02:21:08,520
to get this

6003
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:10,520
because again it sounds like a great idea

6004
02:21:10,520 --> 02:21:12,520
it's I wouldn't mind

6005
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:14,520
a classic Sony

6006
02:21:14,520 --> 02:21:16,520
console and just

6007
02:21:16,520 --> 02:21:18,520
plug and play like the SNES

6008
02:21:18,520 --> 02:21:20,520
and the NES Mini

6009
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:22,520
but again

6010
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:24,520
there are many things that

6011
02:21:24,520 --> 02:21:26,520
I don't know what Sony is thinking about

6012
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:28,520
that really

6013
02:21:28,520 --> 02:21:30,520
I have one pre-ordered

6014
02:21:30,520 --> 02:21:32,520
on Amazon but I'm probably

6015
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:34,520
gonna cancel it the only thing

6016
02:21:34,520 --> 02:21:36,520
and many people probably

6017
02:21:36,520 --> 02:21:38,520
are gonna yell at me because of this

6018
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:40,520
is that probably

6019
02:21:40,520 --> 02:21:42,520
those consoles are

6020
02:21:42,520 --> 02:21:44,520
Playstation TV or Vita TVs

6021
02:21:44,520 --> 02:21:46,520
that they didn't

6022
02:21:46,520 --> 02:21:48,520
sell so it's probably

6023
02:21:48,520 --> 02:21:50,520
gonna be hackable like really

6024
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:52,520
easily hackable

6025
02:21:52,520 --> 02:21:54,520
and you're probably

6026
02:21:54,520 --> 02:21:56,520
gonna insert

6027
02:21:56,520 --> 02:21:58,520
many like roms or homebrew

6028
02:21:58,520 --> 02:22:00,520
and so that's

6029
02:22:00,520 --> 02:22:02,520
the only appeal I see right now

6030
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:04,520
for the console unless it has like

6031
02:22:04,520 --> 02:22:06,520
a really

6032
02:22:06,520 --> 02:22:08,520
cool game that hasn't

6033
02:22:08,520 --> 02:22:10,520
gotten a real release like

6034
02:22:10,520 --> 02:22:12,520
I was talking in chat earlier like

6035
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:14,520
InHander it hasn't

6036
02:22:14,520 --> 02:22:16,520
gotten a real release ever

6037
02:22:16,520 --> 02:22:18,520
so like oh the console

6038
02:22:18,520 --> 02:22:20,520
has it okay I'm gonna get it

6039
02:22:20,520 --> 02:22:22,520
but aside from that I really

6040
02:22:22,520 --> 02:22:24,520
don't know why I would

6041
02:22:24,520 --> 02:22:26,520
buy one of these you know you

6042
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:28,520
kind of reference something there I think is a huge

6043
02:22:28,520 --> 02:22:30,520
missed opportunity from Sony like if you're

6044
02:22:30,520 --> 02:22:32,520
gonna charge a hundred bucks for one of these and get

6045
02:22:32,520 --> 02:22:34,520
them in people's homes why not

6046
02:22:34,520 --> 02:22:36,520
make them capable of doing

6047
02:22:36,520 --> 02:22:38,520
the Vita TV stuff like a Playstation

6048
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:40,520
or the Playstation Now thing

6049
02:22:40,520 --> 02:22:42,520
or a lot of that similar functionality

6050
02:22:42,520 --> 02:22:44,520
the Playstation TV which if I

6051
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:46,520
recall correctly also cost a hundred bucks right

6052
02:22:46,520 --> 02:22:48,520
so yeah the Playstation

6053
02:22:48,520 --> 02:22:50,520
TVs nowadays are so cheap

6054
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:52,520
well that's right so the technology the price

6055
02:22:52,520 --> 02:22:54,520
of those things should have come way down in technology

6056
02:22:54,520 --> 02:22:56,520
I can't imagine that you wouldn't

6057
02:22:56,520 --> 02:22:58,520
be able to get a Playstation emulator

6058
02:22:58,520 --> 02:23:00,520
on one of those Playstation Vita things

6059
02:23:00,520 --> 02:23:02,520
and play you know the PS1

6060
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:04,520
classics and charge you a hundred bucks for that

6061
02:23:04,520 --> 02:23:06,520
you don't even need to get a Playstation 1 emulator they

6062
02:23:06,520 --> 02:23:08,520
have Playstation 1 natively

6063
02:23:08,520 --> 02:23:10,520
so why not sweeten the pot

6064
02:23:10,520 --> 02:23:12,520
and don't just make it about being able to play 20

6065
02:23:12,520 --> 02:23:14,520
Playstation classics but holy

6066
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:16,520
shit this thing will play newer stuff too

6067
02:23:16,520 --> 02:23:18,520
and then maybe Sony wouldn't have had to

6068
02:23:18,520 --> 02:23:20,520
been so quick to abandon the Vita

6069
02:23:20,520 --> 02:23:22,520
but I just they weren't thinking far enough ahead I guess

6070
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:24,520
I think it's more about wanting to

6071
02:23:24,520 --> 02:23:26,520
just you know strike while the iron

6072
02:23:26,520 --> 02:23:28,520
is hot so to speak on these classics

6073
02:23:28,520 --> 02:23:30,520
and as soon as Nintendo had their runaway

6074
02:23:30,520 --> 02:23:32,520
success a couple years ago the

6075
02:23:32,520 --> 02:23:34,520
gears were probably turning on this

6076
02:23:34,520 --> 02:23:36,520
well it's

6077
02:23:36,520 --> 02:23:38,520
a little too late for

6078
02:23:38,520 --> 02:23:40,520
that I think but it will still

6079
02:23:40,520 --> 02:23:42,520
sell people will

6080
02:23:42,520 --> 02:23:44,520
buy it at least but

6081
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:46,520
I don't know if

6082
02:23:46,520 --> 02:23:48,520
Sony is gonna like

6083
02:23:48,520 --> 02:23:50,520
see like a really really

6084
02:23:50,520 --> 02:23:52,520
great success from this I

6085
02:23:52,520 --> 02:23:54,520
really don't but

6086
02:23:54,520 --> 02:23:56,520
I don't know hopefully they

6087
02:23:56,520 --> 02:23:58,520
they change some of this

6088
02:23:58,520 --> 02:24:00,520
or again if

6089
02:24:00,520 --> 02:24:02,520
it's hackable I think that

6090
02:24:02,520 --> 02:24:04,520
that's gonna be the appeal for this because

6091
02:24:04,520 --> 02:24:06,520
for at least for my part

6092
02:24:06,520 --> 02:24:08,520
it's like no

6093
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:10,520
no Sony

6094
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:12,520
alright my friend I'm gonna let you go so we can

6095
02:24:12,520 --> 02:24:14,520
see if anybody else wants to call but thanks for your

6096
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:16,520
thoughts

6097
02:24:16,520 --> 02:24:18,520
alright bye bye

6098
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:48,520
they've got the whole lineup

6099
02:24:48,520 --> 02:24:50,520
too there's like a musical lineup

6100
02:24:50,520 --> 02:24:52,520
and everything while DJ's playing stuff so

6101
02:24:52,520 --> 02:24:54,520
check it out if you got some time

6102
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:56,520
um

6103
02:24:56,520 --> 02:24:58,520
you know there's a Minecraft convention

6104
02:24:58,520 --> 02:25:00,520
going on this weekend I don't know if that's just here locally

6105
02:25:00,520 --> 02:25:02,520
it's just here locally MineCon

6106
02:25:02,520 --> 02:25:04,520
Earth is next week

6107
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:06,520
um yeah the local one here

6108
02:25:06,520 --> 02:25:08,520
I see a lot of tweets about

6109
02:25:08,520 --> 02:25:10,520
it it's so expensive and it's just like

6110
02:25:10,520 --> 02:25:12,520
what is it really there they have like

6111
02:25:12,520 --> 02:25:14,520
some streamers that are there they do

6112
02:25:14,520 --> 02:25:16,520
like a Lego thing they do like some other Minecraft

6113
02:25:16,520 --> 02:25:18,520
stuff but it's like it's so god

6114
02:25:18,520 --> 02:25:20,520
damn it it's like 40 bucks a ticket

6115
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:22,520
oh yeah that's a little pricey

6116
02:25:22,520 --> 02:25:24,520
MineCon world is next week and it's online

6117
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:26,520
it's streaming so

6118
02:25:26,520 --> 02:25:28,520
interesting okay

6119
02:25:28,520 --> 02:25:30,520
alright well I don't think any other calls

6120
02:25:30,520 --> 02:25:32,520

6121
02:25:32,520 --> 02:25:34,520

because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but

02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:08,520
if the voices aren't here to air live

6139
02:26:08,520 --> 02:26:10,520

6169
02:27:08,520 --> 02:27:10,520
fucking amazing and

6170
02:27:10,520 --> 02:27:12,520
thank you again Ikuma JP

6171
02:27:12,520 --> 02:27:14,520
for also helping with obtaining

6172
02:27:14,520 --> 02:27:16,520
Dan's birthday present so

6173
02:27:16,520 --> 02:27:18,520
which I will not announce on air

6174
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:20,520
yet I will also use my

6175
02:27:20,520 --> 02:27:22,520
final thought to pay tribute to Ikuma JP

6176
02:27:22,520 --> 02:27:24,520
this is very thoughtful what you did in sending

6177
02:27:24,520 --> 02:27:26,520
us the gifts I'm always tickled

6178
02:27:26,520 --> 02:27:28,520
when OLR people send us gifts

6179
02:27:28,520 --> 02:27:30,520
and it's not something you have to

6180
02:27:30,520 --> 02:27:32,520
do and it's very nice

6181
02:27:32,520 --> 02:27:34,520
but these are things that I would

6182
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:36,520
these little wafer things what are these called

6183
02:27:36,520 --> 02:27:38,520
these are really good the wafer

6184
02:27:38,520 --> 02:27:40,520
those are pretty good

6185
02:27:40,520 --> 02:27:42,520
alright Loki your final thought tonight

6186
02:27:42,520 --> 02:27:44,520
my final thought

6187
02:27:44,520 --> 02:27:46,520
is

6188
02:27:46,520 --> 02:27:48,520
I don't know hopefully we'll play more games this week

6189
02:27:48,520 --> 02:27:50,520
yes play more games that's a good idea

6190
02:27:50,520 --> 02:27:52,520
everybody out there play more games

6191
02:27:52,520 --> 02:27:54,520
and we'll see you in 7 days to do it all

6192
02:27:54,520 --> 02:27:56,520
