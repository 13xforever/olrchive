7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	17000	After a planned and unplanned weekend off, we're back and we've got lots of news to catch up on.
17000	23000	Join us for a few weeks worth of updates on VR DLC releases, streaming of multiple kinds, and the long arm of the law.
23000	27000	All this, your comments and more, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	38000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
38000	46000	Orange Lounge Radio. It feels so good to say that. Episode number 744 for this September 16th of 2018.
46000	52000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined of course here in studio. We're based in Sacramento, California.
52000	54000	The one and only, Techmaster Loki.
54000	55000	Hello.
55000	56000	Hello, hello. Good to have you back.
56000	57000	Yes, good to be back.
57000	60000	It's good to be back. It's been a couple weeks, as mentioned in the intro.
60000	66000	And by the way, of course, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers, she is on a planned leave due to her day job.
66000	71000	She'll be joining us through the magic of a radio a little later on in the show in a pre-taped segment.
71000	80000	So, but as far as being in the now is concerned, we were always going to be off two weeks ago because I was at DragonCon.
80000	85000	Which, by the way, my god, DragonCon at this point feels like it was six months ago, okay?
85000	91000	I mean, it just, it feels like it was an eternity, but I had a fantastic, wonderful, amazing time at DragonCon.
91000	96000	It really was like my best year yet in many ways. I'll talk a little more about that in a minute.
96000	99000	So I knew I was going to be off for that show and that was Labor Day anyway.
99000	103000	But then we unexpectedly missed last week and things happen, you guys.
103000	109000	What happened is that, and I'll just kind of give you disclosure, it actually was not Loki or myself or DarkSakura that was sick.
109000	112000	It was actually Alan, my husband, who lives here as well.
112000	117000	And he, I think it's okay that I disclose this. It is a little, it's a little crazy, y'all.
117000	123000	He had a disease called hand foot mouth disease, which is something that usually children get.
123000	126000	I don't think folks above five years old.
126000	128000	That is not necessarily true.
128000	135000	Yes. So adults can get it too. But the weird thing is, and what's stumping all the doctors, is that they couldn't figure out how he got it.
135000	139000	Because he's not around kids. We don't have kids.
139000	147000	So here's the thing. The doctor thinks he got it from food because he was eating out all the time while I was out at DragonCon.
147000	150000	And it started to settle in about the Wednesday.
150000	151000	Kids are everywhere.
151000	154000	Yeah, I know. It's crazy, right? So that's, I mean, that's what it was.
154000	156000	He's fine now and he's not here anyway.
156000	159000	But, and honestly, could we have done the show last week?
160000	166000	Probably, but I did not want to take the risk because since it is a kid disease, I did not want Loki to get it. He's had it before.
166000	167000	I've already had it, yeah.
167000	171000	Well, I didn't want you to get the cooties and then give it to your kids. That's what I really didn't want to happen.
171000	177000	Well, my son's had it. My oldest son had it and I got it from him. And it's not fun because you get blisters all over your hands.
177000	178000	It's like chicken pox, but worse.
178000	180000	I've never had chicken pox, so.
180000	183000	Oh, I hope you've had the vaccine because that's, that's tough.
183000	186000	I haven't had the vaccine either. I've lived dangerously, but no.
186000	187000	You should talk to your doctor about that.
187000	195000	Uh, I've had the, um, disease. So yeah, basically I got blisters all over my hands and my feet.
195000	197000	No DDR when you have that.
197000	203000	No, and it was hard to play games. I still played games, but it was hard because like it was uncomfortable a little bit.
203000	204000	But then eventually they go away.
204000	206000	Yeah, and that's where he's at now. They went away.
206000	211000	They get like a fever, I guess, for like a day and then it just, it's just all blisters and that's it.
211000	216000	And so the crazy, I never got it and we live together and you know, we're married.
216000	219000	Well, my wife never got it and my youngest son never got it.
219000	223000	Yeah, it's weird. So, and we, I don't know if it's because maybe I had it as a kid and I just don't know.
223000	227000	I know I had chicken pox, but I don't, I don't know about, I mean, I would have been too young to remember anyway.
227000	232000	But anyway, this isn't the disease and infectious podcast, it's a video game podcast.
232000	235000	But I wanted to give you guys a reason why we've been away for two weeks.
235000	245000	And also, you know, coming on the heels of Dragon Con, you know that I've done a lot of work and I'm very thankful to be included with the Dragon Con podcasting track,
245000	247000	which by the way, they're going to have a brand new name next year.
247000	252000	It's now the Dragon Con Digital Media Creation Track or DMC.
252000	256000	Devil may cry. No, but it's Digital Media Creation Track.
256000	258000	So I've been involved with them for a long time.
258000	267000	So every time I come back from Dragon Con, I'm like so motivated to like broadcast and like, I need to start three more podcasts and let's revive a podcast I did 10 years ago and all that stuff.
267000	269000	Like that's, that's what happens to me when I come back from Dragon Con.
269000	273000	And then I had a Twitch 101 panel and that went really well.
273000	276000	And I was like, I need to do all the things on Twitch and I need to be streaming more.
276000	282000	So I'm so motivated. I get back and my internet is crazy.
282000	288000	Like I'm not able to upload the speeds that I usually upload at.
288000	294000	So my 10 megabit upload for some reason is only five megabits when I uploaded Twitch.
294000	300000	But yet even if I lower my bit rate down to like 4000 or something under that, I still have problems.
300000	304000	So there's something really weird and I don't want to get into it on this show.
304000	309000	I've detailed it on my Twitter at MrRobRoberts. I did actually a Twitch video tonight.
309000	313000	So what I did, I used that whole premiere thing on Twitch.
313000	316000	I recorded a video for 40 minutes at like two o'clock.
316000	320000	I like played one of the new dungeons in World of Warcraft since I've been tinkering in that expansion.
320000	325000	And then I scheduled a premiere for like 4.15 or whenever my video was finally done processing.
325000	328000	And so it premiered right at that time.
328000	330000	And so it was like a pseudo live stream.
330000	335000	I wasn't really live, but it was like I was live. I just didn't have the chat comments.
335000	338000	So I guess it's kind of like here at Vaga Network.
338000	342000	Our radio feed is, you know, we have new episodes of Pod Culture, Mondays, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.
342000	344000	You know, it's kind of like a premiere in that regard.
344000	346000	That's kind of what I did on Twitch.
346000	349000	So I talked much more about that.
349000	354000	So if you want to see my Twitch channel, MrRobRoberts, I get into all the details about what's going on back and forth.
354000	361000	But I'm just in such a good mood now to be doing this show because I feel like my rhythm got thrown
361000	367000	when I was at my most motivated I've been throughout the year post Dragon Con.
367000	370000	And so, yeah, it's just it feels great to be back.
370000	374000	I'll talk about Dragon Con a little more later on, but it is a video game show.
374000	378000	And there's a lot of big video game news going on this week, namely the Nintendo Direct.
378000	381000	Why don't we dive into that first, especially because this might be the show.
381000	387000	I mean, hopefully the first OLR people are hearing coming off Dragon Con is not the one where I got very emotional,
387000	392000	which is the last, which is the show that's been sitting on the feed for three weeks before we went to Dragon Con.
392000	399000	But I would like to like to have a little enthusiasm, a little talk here on video games and what's going on with Nintendo.
399000	402000	So obviously everybody's talking about this Nintendo Direct.
402000	404000	Loki, let's jump in. What did Nintendo do with their Direct?
404000	406000	They announced games.
406000	408000	Well, that's good. We like game. We like game announcements, right?
408000	410000	Yeah. And then they talk.
410000	414000	Nintendo's biggest critic. How do you on this show, how do you how do you feel coming off this Nintendo Direct?
414000	419000	OK. It wasn't like like I saw one, especially like I paid attention.
419000	424000	Actually, that's when I came in the shows when they were talking about their online services, like in the middle of that.
424000	427000	OK. It's just all right.
427000	433000	I mean, it's not very fleshed out, but you're not paying a lot for it.
433000	437000	So I guess it's that's like. And what do you what do you expect?
437000	441000	You're getting a vanilla program for vanilla dollars. Yes, exactly.
441000	447000	So it's just all right. Well, for all the people that roll their eyes when you start to go off on Nintendo, I think they will take.
447000	457000	And it was OK. It was it wasn't like I didn't have high expectations and they met those non high expectations, I guess.
457000	462000	I don't know what to basically say. I mean, so they announced games, so they had lots of different things.
462000	470000	Three DS games that, you know, Kirby's extra epic yarn. They had Luigi's Mansion three coming to the switch.
470000	475000	They talked a little bit about the new update for Splatoon two.
475000	482000	Mario Tennis Aces was getting DLC. They are remastering New Super Mario Brothers U.
482000	485000	OK, well, we're like machine gunning this and I've got so much to say.
485000	491000	No, that's OK. So Splatoon two, I didn't really I my my feed kind of hiccuped, so I didn't really see everything.
491000	494000	Is it true that this is their battle royale update?
494000	497000	That's like if I know I didn't watch any of that part.
497000	505000	So, OK, then I need the help of our chatters over at live dot vog network dot com because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network,
505000	508000	vog network dot com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
508000	513000	And part of the fun of doing the show live is that we have a chat room to give us their call.
514000	516000	Steer us when we go adrift.
516000	523000	They were, I know, changing up some stuff, how they do Splat Fest to go along with this as well.
523000	525000	So once that online service comes.
525000	528000	Dartetsuya straight up says, yeah, I wasn't sure what that was about TBH.
528000	533000	The parts of the trailer I saw were really kind of abstract, like it didn't really explain what was new.
533000	538000	And one of my buddies was the one that told me that it was like a battle royale update.
538000	544000	But I don't know if that was just that's what I want or if it's what what I read somewhere.
544000	549000	Yeah. Nifty asks, where's Flacco? He's the Splatoon expert. He's a podcast listener.
549000	552000	He's probably shouting the answer in his car right now.
552000	555000	Like I know one of the things I think they changed with the Splat Fest.
555000	561000	It's now they have kind of like a casual and competitive mode for the Splat Fest.
561000	565000	So they split it up that way as well.
565000	569000	I don't know. I'm not in the Splatoon, so I didn't pay attention to it. Plus I came in late.
569000	574000	I was walking. I walk now. Apparently that's the thing I do.
574000	577000	OK, I'm actually loading Nintendo's site to see what the heck's going on.
577000	580000	They're saying new weapons set that are part of the Kensa collections.
580000	583000	The whole Splat Fest refresh that you're talking about.
583000	586000	New sub and special weapons are also on the way.
586000	590000	So this doesn't say anything about the whole battle royale.
590000	597000	But it says that Splatoon will have two new modes, normal and pro, that replace the solo and team modes and all that.
597000	600000	And normal means you go into a Splat Fest battle on your own.
600000	605000	And if it's, yeah, if you go into pro, then what is this?
605000	610000	You get into, where is this? No, it's talking about the ink. That's still just talking about the casual mode.
610000	613000	Oh, pro is for you want to go solo and push themselves to the limit.
613000	617000	You're judging your Splat Fest power. You can get into the top 100.
617000	620000	So that sounds like something that Flaco will be going for over on his stream.
620000	624000	So, cheap plug for Flaco Jones over on Twitch. Flaco underscore Jones.
624000	629000	I don't think I've seen him not stream Splatoon in a long time.
629000	635000	Alright, well that's cool for the people that are still turning away at Splatoon. That's cool to see what the game's still getting love.
635000	641000	They did talk about the NES classic games that they're going to have on there.
641000	645000	Yeah, cool. I saw some really cool stuff in there.
645000	648000	River City Ransom. I don't remember that in the first list of 10.
648000	653000	Yeah, I mean it looks nice. It's a nice interface and everything. They're going to have online play for some of those as well.
653000	656000	This really does feel like what we should have had on the Wii.
656000	661000	Yeah, or like the NES classic system.
661000	670000	And then if you want to get in on that NES classic gaming and you want to get some Joy-Con controllers that look like NES controllers,
670000	677000	you can do that if you subscribe to the service and it's going to be one per account that gets to purchase those.
677000	684000	Do you think this is an anti-scalping measure? Because as an anti-scalping measure, I've seen a lot of hate for this on the internet,
684000	690000	but as an anti-scalping measure, I'm like, yes, finally Nintendo's doing something about all the scalping of their products.
690000	694000	Maybe, but they probably think, well you don't need it if you're not paying for the service.
695000	702000	I guess. Although you know what the twist is, if you have a family plan, because you know some people were talking about doing family plan pools,
702000	706000	because family plans can be shared and I don't know, I think it was like seven accounts or something.
706000	712000	Some people were talking about doing the family plan. You can't get more than one with the family plan.
712000	717000	So if you go into one of these pools with five other people, only one of you is getting those NES controllers if you want it.
717000	719000	I don't know.
719000	721000	That's what eBay's for.
721000	726000	If you buy it and you're like, I don't want this shit, and then you're like, how am I gonna sell it for $400?
726000	735000	I don't know if I really need those controllers. I mean, it's like saying that the Joy-Cons are bad for playing.
735000	737000	I think the Joy-Cons are fine.
737000	743000	Most likely I'm not playing Nintendo games over the internet with people. That's not what I'm gonna use the service for.
743000	748000	This is where you and I are different. I'm gonna use this a lot. I hope. I hope there's people that want to play this game.
748000	755000	If I'm gonna spend $60 on those controllers, I might as well just buy a fucking NES classic because what's the fucking point at that point?
755000	764000	This is why I want my Twitch stream to work. Because I think playing something like River City Ransom with Bobby or my buddy Delvin or something online would be a lot of fun.
764000	773000	Because then we can laugh and hoot and holler when one of the characters goes barf with the exclamation point as they do in River City Ransom.
773000	782000	So, I'm really looking forward to the online thing. I've been waiting like 10 years to play Virtual Console games online, so this part is super exciting to me.
782000	796000	I mean, sure, I wish there were Super Nintendo games. I wish there were N64 games. I wish there was more. I wish this wasn't being drip-fed, but it's something. I'll take it.
796000	799000	You know what? It's better than nothing. This is what we have today.
799000	802000	I still don't understand what their fucking app does.
805000	810000	For a lot of people, nothing. And I think that's part of the reason why some people...
810000	815000	Well, you know this whole online thing when Nintendo's getting a lot of hate online? People are like,
816000	818000	Why is Nintendo charging this money?
818000	823000	Well, for one, Nintendo warned you this was coming. I mentioned this on the last OLR we did.
823000	826000	It's on the back of every Switch game that's online.
826000	832000	It says it's free until the launch of Nintendo's online system, which was supposed to be like summer.
832000	839000	Like last year. I don't have a Switch game in front of me, but I'm pretty sure a lot of those disclaimers are like,
839000	844000	It was supposed to be pay a long time ago. This whole thing has just been a courtesy extension or whatever.
844000	850000	So, I don't know. What are you getting with Xbox Live and PlayStation Plus?
850000	854000	Free games. Like free new games. Like recent games.
854000	859000	Okay. And to be fair, Nintendo's service is a hell of a lot cheaper.
859000	861000	It's $20 a year versus $50.
861000	865000	But you're getting a lot more full-price games.
865000	869000	I understand that you're paying less, but you're getting less.
869000	873000	But that's okay. I don't see where the problem is to complain about that.
873000	884000	My thing with it is, Nintendo I think values the value that they see their NES games, their old NES games,
884000	888000	is higher than what I perceive them to be.
888000	891000	I think they should be much cheaper.
891000	895000	Should never have been charging $5 a piece for that shit. Never.
895000	902000	And so they feel that it's, oh, you're getting such a value because they're like $5, $8 a piece.
902000	906000	Whereas in reality, maybe not so much.
906000	910000	I mean, great, yeah. Super Mario Bros. 3, great fucking game.
910000	913000	But it's been a great fucking game for decades now.
913000	916000	And it's old. It's old. It is.
916000	918000	And that is still a great game.
918000	922000	But dude, like fucking new movies that come out,
922000	925000	like movies that are decades old aren't necessarily being,
925000	930000	they're not priced at the same as a brand new blockbuster movie that just came out.
930000	934000	It's because that shit's been out forever and the demand for it isn't as high.
934000	940000	Granted, people like being nostalgic and they bought the NES classic systems and stuff like that.
940000	946000	And I'm sure this will be popular for a while, but it's not the same as getting like Switch games.
946000	950000	Like, you know, if they offered, you know, even though I don't fucking want it,
950000	953000	hey, 1-2 Switch is the free game this month or something like that.
953000	955000	You know, like an actual Switch game.
955000	959000	Yeah, but then that would be a steal if they were charging $20 bucks a year.
959000	961000	Not a month, Loki. A year.
961000	964000	If they were charging $20 bucks a year and giving you stuff on that level,
964000	968000	then like that would be, Nintendo would be like losing money on it.
968000	972000	That's why they can't, they could charge more for it if they offered more as a service.
972000	974000	Oh yeah, I see. All right, I get what you're getting.
974000	976000	But they're not because they don't have it there because they're,
976000	980000	this is kind of like fucking Little League shit, you know?
980000	983000	So that's fine. Let's, let's let them take baby steps into it.
983000	987000	I'm glad that they're actually doing an online service fucking decades late, but whatever.
987000	991000	I don't remember free games being a part of Xbox Live back on the 360.
991000	994000	So, you know, it took them time to grow too.
994000	998000	I just think a lot of people had the expectation that Nintendo was going to mirror.
998000	999000	Here's what I think happened.
999000	1004000	I think a lot of people had the expectation that Nintendo was going to mirror what Xbox Live and PlayStation do.
1004000	1007000	Meaning you're going to be able to, like, people, I swear,
1007000	1010000	I think there were people out there that was expecting this Direct to be like,
1010000	1013000	now you can stream your games online through the Switch.
1013000	1015000	You can do SharePlay with a friend through the Switch.
1015000	1018000	You can have trophies and achievements that get online.
1018000	1020000	Like people are just straight up making shit up.
1020000	1026000	Why they can't just have like, okay, these NES games have the multiplayer component to them.
1026000	1030000	And, you know, later on other NES games could get that multiplayer update as well.
1030000	1034000	But for now, you can still play them, but they're single player or you can play them on the local co-op.
1034000	1035000	Why can't they do that?
1035000	1037000	You wanted that avalanche of like a hundred NES games.
1037000	1039000	Why can't they do that? Because they could have totally done that.
1039000	1041000	It's just that they're like, no, no, no.
1041000	1044000	We need to make sure that we get them all happening in multiplayer.
1044000	1047000	You know what? There's one player NES games out there.
1047000	1050000	There's plenty of one player NES games, fucking Legend of Zelda.
1050000	1054000	I'm sure that's part of it, but that doesn't need fucking two players in it.
1054000	1058000	There's lots of one player NES games that you just throw up there.
1058000	1061000	Don't tell me you can't fucking run on that because homebrew runs that shit.
1061000	1065000	Okay, Orange Right in our chat at live.vognetware.com says,
1065000	1069000	it's good that there is an import and a game that was never on the Virtual Console in the first year.
1069000	1071000	They didn't wait until 2019.
1071000	1075000	Granted, it's Twinbee and Pro Wrestling, but still, and not to insult Twinbee.
1075000	1081000	Okay, well, that is neat that at least there is, I mean, Pro Wrestling was not that good of a game.
1081000	1082000	And that's not me slamming wrestling.
1082000	1084000	Like there was a WrestleMania game on NES that was cool,
1084000	1088000	but Nintendo's Pro Wrestling game was like not that good.
1088000	1093000	But it is still neat that, you know, it's there,
1093000	1097000	and it's something that you can make a decision for yourself on if it's good or not.
1097000	1103000	And the thing that is actually kind of cool about this whole Nesflix-style system that they have
1103000	1107000	is that if you play it and decide after 30 seconds you don't like it,
1107000	1110000	well, it came with your subscription to play Mario Kart online anyway.
1110000	1113000	So, I mean, I don't know, I'm kind of, I'm into it.
1113000	1117000	Like, I, you know, we knew Nintendo was going to be charging for online.
1117000	1119000	It's not that expensive, all things considered.
1119000	1121000	I'll probably just plop down for a year up front,
1121000	1123000	and now I'll have these NES games I can play on friends of mine.
1123000	1124000	I think it's going to be cool.
1124000	1126000	I'm going to do that as well because it's not expensive,
1126000	1129000	and because I need to if I ever want to play online, although I have not.
1129000	1133000	It would have been fantastic if Reggie came out of that direct and said,
1133000	1137000	100 NES classics and 50 Super Nintendo classics all out the gate,
1137000	1139000	and you get a game, and you get a game, and you get a game.
1139000	1143000	But, you know what, this is the more realistic approach. It's fine.
1143000	1145000	We all knew Nintendo was going to drip-feed it.
1145000	1147000	I just wanted to keep the pace up.
1147000	1151000	If they're going to add three more to the pot every month, like their show,
1151000	1155000	like, keep that up for five years.
1155000	1156000	You know what I mean?
1157000	1160000	Make sure you have that plan to keep this going for years,
1160000	1163000	because I imagine, you know, and I'm okay with, okay,
1163000	1166000	and then when they run out of NES games, let's say in a year's time,
1166000	1169000	that they want to do, now the Super Nintendo games start coming,
1169000	1173000	and then the N64 or whatever they decide to do.
1173000	1177000	But it's very obvious that they're not looking to do everything,
1177000	1182000	or we wouldn't have things like this SNK collection, the Sega Ages.
1182000	1185000	Like, this is not going to go down the same path, or arcade archives.
1185000	1187000	This is not going to go down the same path as Virtual Console.
1187000	1189000	Nintendo is keeping this Nintendo.
1189000	1193000	I think it's a given we'll get Super Nintendo eventually.
1193000	1196000	I just hope, one more thing I'm going to say about this,
1196000	1199000	I just hope it doesn't go the whole DS route where it's,
1199000	1203000	well, you need the new 3DS to play this, because you all know,
1203000	1208000	we all know, we all know there will be a Switch Deluxe of some sort.
1208000	1210000	It will happen.
1210000	1214000	Maybe not next year, but, you know, around the time that PlayStation
1214000	1218000	and Sony and Microsoft are starting to show off what's next for them,
1218000	1220000	Nintendo's going to be like,
1220000	1223000	well, how about the power of the Switch Deluxe?
1223000	1225000	And now you can play Super Nintendo games,
1225000	1228000	but only through the power of the Switch Deluxe.
1228000	1231000	To which I'll tell them, fuck your stupid, super whatever Switch game.
1231000	1233000	Be prepared. Be prepared.
1233000	1235000	That shit can fucking play Wii games now, okay?
1235000	1237000	I know, it should. It should fucking.
1237000	1239000	It is playing Wii U games.
1239000	1242000	This is about as stupid as saying Sony's PlayStation 4
1242000	1244000	can't fucking handle PlayStation 1 games.
1244000	1246000	It's goddamn retarded.
1246000	1250000	It's just, you can't say that intelligently.
1250000	1252000	It's dumb.
1252000	1255000	The system can fucking handle Super Nintendo games.
1255000	1257000	Alright, let's move on.
1257000	1260000	What else did we have, Logie?
1260000	1262000	Anyways.
1262000	1265000	Katamari reroll, so they're re-remastering that again.
1265000	1267000	Okay, yay. I'm very happy about that.
1267000	1269000	Because the last time it came out was remastered,
1269000	1271000	so it's fucking remastered yet again.
1271000	1274000	You know what, though? I seem to recall,
1274000	1277000	the first two games were the good ones,
1277000	1279000	and then it didn't get very good after that,
1279000	1282000	because I don't think the guy who created Katamari was with it anymore,
1282000	1286000	and so they started to kind of, you know, roll off the rails a little bit.
1286000	1290000	So, I'm okay with a remaster of the first game. I really am.
1290000	1292000	It's been long enough.
1292000	1295000	Let's revisit it in glorious widescreen.
1295000	1297000	I'm imagining it's a down...
1297000	1299000	Oh no, maybe they are going to release it as a cartridge.
1299000	1301000	But whatever. I'm in.
1301000	1302000	It's Katamari.
1302000	1304000	Well, yeah. I have to get it.
1304000	1305000	Yeah, I know, right?
1305000	1308000	I'm just disappointed that it's not new,
1308000	1311000	because it needs to be new.
1311000	1313000	I'm sorry, I'm screaming over here.
1313000	1315000	SSG100Matt in chat says,
1315000	1317000	Last time Katamari was this big in the news,
1317000	1319000	OLR was in trouble over it.
1319000	1321000	Truth.
1321000	1323000	It's true, yeah.
1323000	1325000	How quickly we forget the Vita game.
1325000	1329000	How quickly we forget there was a Katamari launch game on the Vita.
1329000	1331000	Alright, anyway.
1331000	1333000	Was it Touch My Katamari?
1333000	1335000	Maybe. I don't remember what it was called.
1335000	1337000	Yeah, probably.
1337000	1339000	It was not very good, from what I remember.
1339000	1340000	It was okay.
1340000	1342000	But yeah, I mean, it just, you know,
1342000	1344000	it wasn't enough to keep the Katamari games,
1344000	1346000	or games in general, coming on the Vita.
1346000	1348000	Alright, so yay, Katamari. What else?
1348000	1350000	And then, of course,
1350000	1352000	they were showing off
1352000	1355000	the new fighter for Smash Brothers.
1356000	1358000	And, of course,
1358000	1361000	coming from Animal Crossing.
1361000	1363000	And then, of course,
1363000	1365000	Animal Crossing itself.
1365000	1367000	So there was the fake tease that,
1367000	1371000	oh hey, it's just an Animal Crossing character, fighter, and...
1371000	1373000	But then, oh ho ho!
1373000	1374000	There's also Animal Crossing.
1374000	1375000	Yeah. And Tom Nook.
1375000	1377000	I was hoping Tom Nook would be the fighter, but you know.
1377000	1379000	Yeah, I actually thought it would be a reveal
1379000	1381000	that Tom Nook was like a shadow character.
1381000	1383000	That would have been kind of rad.
1383000	1386000	As if I'm poo-pooing the news of a new Animal Crossing.
1386000	1387000	No, that's very exciting.
1387000	1390000	But, you know, like literally two minutes before the direct,
1390000	1392000	I wrote this tweet that was like,
1392000	1394000	I can't live tweet the direct,
1394000	1396000	because I need my phone to be able to watch it.
1396000	1398000	So, you know, lower those expectations.
1398000	1401000	Don't expect them to announce a new Animal Crossing.
1401000	1404000	And then, of course, when that first trailer started,
1404000	1406000	I was like, aw, motherfucker.
1406000	1409000	They're going to announce Animal Crossing right after I wrote that tweet.
1409000	1412000	I pretty, like, she says something like,
1412000	1414000	the mayor's away or something.
1414000	1416000	She says something where it's very obvious,
1416000	1418000	oh, she's going to reveal that she's in Smash.
1418000	1422000	Of course, Isabel in Smash rumors were out there months ago,
1422000	1426000	you know, and it's a very logical character to add to the game.
1426000	1427000	So, of course.
1427000	1428000	And then I was like, oh, okay.
1428000	1429000	So that's what they're announcing.
1429000	1430000	Wow, what a troll.
1430000	1431000	This is an epic troll.
1431000	1433000	And then the second trailer started,
1433000	1436000	and the disclaimer came up again on the screen,
1436000	1439000	may not reflect actual gameplay.
1439000	1443000	And that's when I knew, oh, this is an actual Animal Crossing reveal.
1443000	1445000	They just fucked my tweet.
1445000	1446000	But you know what?
1446000	1449000	If I'm going to be wrong, that's the reason I want to be wrong.
1449000	1453000	I'm never happier to be wrong than cases like that.
1453000	1456000	I just, you know, I knew a new Animal Crossing game would happen someday.
1456000	1458000	Of course, one's going to happen.
1458000	1459000	I just didn't think it would be this soon.
1459000	1462000	I really did think Nintendo was going to focus on the mobile thing,
1462000	1465000	but maybe because the mobile version hasn't really taken off for them,
1465000	1467000	they decided, let's do this.
1467000	1469000	So they had a new Game Freak game called Town.
1469000	1470000	It's a working title.
1470000	1472000	So that looked interesting.
1472000	1474000	It all takes place within one town or something.
1474000	1476000	Oh, yeah.
1476000	1477000	RPG.
1477000	1479000	They had, what was it?
1479000	1481000	Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy, and more Final Fantasy.
1481000	1487000	Crystal Chronicles Remastered, Final Fantasy XV Pocket was out that day.
1487000	1490000	World of Final Fantasy Maxima,
1490000	1496000	Chocobo's Dungeon, Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy IX, Final Fantasy X, X-2,
1496000	1498000	and Final Fantasy XII.
1498000	1500000	Sorry, no, VIII or VI.
1500000	1501000	Okay, here's, okay.
1501000	1503000	Can we talk about this for a minute?
1503000	1506000	Okay, first off, I am so here for the Chocobo Dungeon
1506000	1508000	and for Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.
1508000	1509000	Where's that Fox Chocobo racing?
1509000	1512000	That should have been the racing title that should have been highlighted there.
1512000	1514000	Where's my Chocobo racing remaster?
1514000	1515000	I'm not going to disagree.
1515000	1518000	So here's what's obviously happening.
1518000	1522000	Square Enix is taking all of their PC ports that they've done recently
1522000	1528000	and are going back into Unity or whatever and export to Switch.
1528000	1532000	Obviously, I'm very much oversimplifying what really happens.
1532000	1533000	I know that.
1533000	1538000	But we know they're taking their PC ports and basically now porting them over to Switch
1538000	1541000	because it shouldn't be that difficult.
1541000	1545000	Especially like the X and X-2, those were on PlayStation 3,
1545000	1550000	as was Final Fantasy VII was a download title on PlayStation 4.
1550000	1555000	I don't remember if IX was, but I know it was a PC title.
1555000	1560000	So obviously they're dumping this whole library onto the Switch, which is cool.
1560000	1565000	I mean, I got really excited seeing that Final Fantasy XII is on the Switch,
1565000	1568000	but then I'm like, I've already bought that game two times.
1568000	1570000	Once on PC, once on PlayStation 4.
1570000	1574000	I'm not going to buy it again on the Switch just to have it portable,
1574000	1578000	but I think it's great for the people that maybe only have a Switch at home
1578000	1580000	and not a PC strong enough to run it.
1580000	1581000	That's cool for them.
1581000	1583000	They'll finally get to play the game, yay.
1583000	1588000	But I find it fascinating just how much of the talk on Twitter is,
1588000	1591000	where's Final Fantasy VIII, though?
1591000	1593000	Do you hate VIII?
1593000	1595000	Where's Final Fantasy VIII?
1595000	1601000	And I'm like, they just announced seven, nine, ten, ten, two, twelve.
1601000	1604000	They announced five Final Fantasy games,
1604000	1608000	and you're complaining about the one that's not there.
1608000	1610000	And here's the thing.
1610000	1613000	Most people that are making that, I say most people,
1613000	1615000	because I know there's going to be somebody that pops up and says,
1615000	1617000	no, I'm very serious about my complaints.
1617000	1619000	Most people that are writing those tweets and complaining
1619000	1623000	Nintendo hates Final Fantasy VIII or whatever the hell they're saying out there,
1623000	1625000	would probably not buy it anyway,
1625000	1629000	and are not going to buy seven or nine, which are very similar.
1629000	1633000	And this goes beyond, look, I know you all know I don't care for Final Fantasy VIII.
1633000	1636000	It is my least favorite Final Fantasy game.
1636000	1637000	I said it. Deal with it.
1637000	1639000	And the reason why, it's not the story.
1639000	1641000	I get that y'all are tied to the story.
1641000	1643000	It's not the story that upsets me.
1643000	1644000	The story's fine.
1644000	1647000	The story should have been the Final Fantasy movie they did.
1647000	1653000	It's that draw junction thing completely ruins the gameplay for me.
1653000	1655000	Deal with it.
1655000	1657000	But here's the thing.
1657000	1658000	I don't understand.
1658000	1662000	Finally, after all these years, we can say Final Fantasy VII is on a Nintendo system.
1662000	1664000	Who would have thought we would ever see the day?
1664000	1666000	But yet everybody just wants to complain.
1666000	1667000	But where's VIII?
1667000	1670000	Well, did you think that maybe if you support some of these other games,
1670000	1672000	maybe there will be incentive to do VIII?
1672000	1675000	Maybe VIII was not as portable.
1675000	1679000	Because, again, they just recently did VII on PlayStation 4.
1679000	1680000	I'm not talking about the remake.
1680000	1684000	I'm talking about, remember at the PlayStation experience a couple years ago,
1684000	1687000	they announced Final Fantasy VII available today.
1687000	1690000	And it had that audience reaction of the stone faces
1690000	1694000	because it was the old Final Fantasy VII.
1694000	1698000	So that is what is going on the Switch as is, you know, X, X-2, X-12.
1698000	1700000	We all know what we're getting with that.
1700000	1705000	So it's just, you know, for whatever reason VIII just isn't as easily portable.
1705000	1707000	But if these other Final Fantasy games do well,
1707000	1712000	then I would imagine they're going to have the incentive to maybe go back
1712000	1714000	and do some of these other Final Fantasy games,
1714000	1716000	which would include, yes, maybe VIII.
1716000	1720000	I kind of don't want them to do Final Fantasy V and VI
1720000	1723000	if they're just going to slap those mobile ports that are on Steam
1723000	1728000	over to the Switch because those games deserve better.
1728000	1731000	But, you know, we'll see what happens.
1731000	1735000	I think it's still exciting to have Square Enix games,
1735000	1738000	Final Fantasy games and all this coming out on the Switch this much.
1738000	1741000	I'm here for Crystal Chronicles and Chocobo Dungeon.
1741000	1743000	The rest of them, I've already bought them,
1743000	1746000	so I don't see myself buying them again just to have them portable.
1746000	1747000	That's it.
1747000	1750000	Anyway, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1750000	1752000	YYR says, hold up, I have a question.
1752000	1755000	Did they announce the Final Fantasy VII remake for Switch
1755000	1757000	or just an old port of Final Fantasy VII?
1757000	1759000	No, not the remake, just old port.
1759000	1761000	Yeah, it's not going to be able to run the remake.
1761000	1764000	That's why Final Fantasy XV looks the way it does.
1764000	1769000	Yeah, so, well, the Final Fantasy XV has been out on phones for forever.
1769000	1773000	That's why I'm nervous that they're going to just do V and VI
1773000	1775000	and that terrible chrono tribute PC thing next.
1775000	1779000	I know, it's so weird that the Switch runs mobile games quite well.
1779000	1781000	You know what else runs on mobile platforms?
1781000	1785000	Fucking Super Nintendo games, that's right!
1785000	1787000	Alright, anyway.
1787000	1792000	SST100Matt says, I just found it funny that they so obviously skipped VIII.
1792000	1794000	I also don't like Final Fantasy VIII, but I mean,
1794000	1796000	just because they didn't announce it now,
1796000	1798000	doesn't mean they won't come out with it later.
1798000	1804000	I mean, the big oversight of VIII, when it's like 7, 9, 10,
1804000	1806000	we all know why they don't do XI, it's online,
1806000	1808000	and XII, you know, it's like, there's very obviously-
1808000	1810000	No, I don't know why they don't do XI.
1810000	1811000	Why isn't XI on the Switch?
1811000	1814000	Fair enough, but there's very obviously a number missing in that sequence,
1814000	1817000	which for me, when I'm not a big fan of Final Fantasy VIII,
1817000	1822000	is great for trolling tweets, but I'm not really trying to be an asshole.
1822000	1824000	Like, I'll get my one little troll tweet out of my system,
1824000	1827000	and then it's like, but, you know, for those that like VIII,
1827000	1829000	I do hope it comes out eventually.
1829000	1836000	And from what I understand, the PC version did allow you to draw 99 Magics or something.
1836000	1840000	Like, there was a cheat built into it, so that if you hated the system like I do,
1840000	1844000	it made it a lot easier, but it's like, but the system's still there in the first place.
1844000	1847000	You even have to draw one still, it's bleh.
1847000	1849000	Anyway.
1849000	1853000	I think it'll go okay for him.
1853000	1854000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,
1854000	1858000	I might buy Final Fantasy IX only because I haven't bought it a second time yet.
1858000	1859000	Well, there you go.
1859000	1861000	Fifth Dream says, I love VIII.
1861000	1863000	I thought I was the only one, though.
1863000	1865000	Not if you check Twitter.
1865000	1866000	Not if you check Twitter.
1866000	1868000	You would think the whole world VIII is their favorite.
1868000	1872000	I was like, where were you people to fight me earlier?
1872000	1873000	Anyway.
1873000	1877000	All right, so Final Fantasy Galore from Square Enix, that's pretty cool.
1877000	1879000	And then of course they showed Daemon Ex Machina,
1879000	1882000	which is the kind of armored core spiritual successor type thing.
1882000	1883000	Oh yeah, that looked interesting.
1883000	1884000	Civ VI.
1884000	1886000	Yay!
1886000	1892000	And it didn't look like it was a cartoonified Civ Revolution type thing,
1892000	1895000	which actually I love Civ Revolution, so I wouldn't even care if it was that.
1895000	1899000	But it looks like it really is just Civ VI, but on the Switch.
1899000	1901000	So that's pretty cool.
1901000	1903000	And then Yoshi's Crafted World.
1903000	1904000	That looked cute.
1904000	1905000	Yeah, it looked neat.
1905000	1906000	Yeah.
1906000	1911000	I mean, obviously it's a throwback to Super Mario World II, Yoshi's Island.
1911000	1914000	And there's been a few other games inspired by that since,
1914000	1917000	like the yarn Yoshi Wooly World or whatever that was.
1917000	1918000	Yeah.
1918000	1919000	So.
1919000	1920000	That's all I can think of.
1920000	1921000	All right.
1921000	1924000	And then, what was I going to say?
1924000	1927000	They had a fighting game collection, or not fighting game,
1927000	1931000	like an arcade brawler collection that was from Capcom.
1931000	1933000	Oh yeah.
1933000	1936000	I was like, oh yeah, the Final Fight and all those games.
1936000	1939000	You know what's interesting, and we should talk about this,
1939000	1942000	a lot of those announcements were not unique to Switch.
1942000	1947000	That beat-em-up collection is coming out on PlayStation, pretty much everything.
1947000	1952000	The Final Fantasy ports, as the Nintendo Direct is going on,
1952000	1957000	Major Nelson puts out a tweet that says, hey, guess what?
1957000	1961000	We've got all these Final Fantasy games coming out on Xbox soon.
1961000	1966000	And they're getting all the same stuff except they don't have Pocket Edition
1966000	1968000	or Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon for whatever reason.
1968000	1973000	But like the 7, the 9, the 10, 10, 2, 12, all of that is also on Xbox.
1973000	1978000	It was just funny because it was very much a, hey, over here you guys,
1978000	1981000	over here, me too, you guys, us over here, I'm cool too.
1981000	1984000	Don't forget your Xbox, we love you.
1984000	1987000	It was just kind of a funny moment on Twitter.
1987000	1988000	I don't know.
1988000	1992000	It struck me as just kind of funny that Microsoft was like, we're cool too.
1992000	1996000	But the thing with Microsoft, and maybe this speaks to the state
1996000	1999000	of where I'm at with my Xbox One, I don't know.
1999000	2004000	I thought the 10 and 10, 2, and Final Fantasy 12,
2004000	2007000	I thought all of that was already on Xbox One.
2007000	2011000	I didn't realize Xbox One was skipped over on that stuff.
2011000	2013000	I thought it was already there.
2013000	2015000	Yeah, I didn't realize that.
2015000	2018000	So I guess that's why they're happy to finally have them.
2018000	2019000	I don't know.
2019000	2021000	So anyway.
2021000	2024000	SHO 100 Matt says, Capcom beat-em-up collection.
2024000	2027000	That looked cool, and you can do online co-op play.
2027000	2030000	Well, you'll notice a lot of stuff in that Direct,
2030000	2035000	the common theme was online stuff capped with Animal Crossing,
2035000	2039000	which is Nintendo's one of their biggest online games,
2039000	2040000	next to Smash and stuff.
2040000	2043000	But that's a big franchise that people are going to want to play online
2043000	2044000	in some capacity.
2044000	2047000	I mean, we'll find out next year what Animal Crossing will let you do online.
2047000	2051000	But in the meantime, Nintendo, besides Smash,
2051000	2055000	which they didn't really talk about, which I actually think made people happy.
2055000	2057000	Yes, there was the Isabelle reveal,
2057000	2060000	but outside of that, they didn't really talk about Smash Brothers,
2060000	2061000	and I think that's what people were hoping for,
2061000	2063000	is that we wanted to hear about some other stuff.
2063000	2065000	But I think a lot of the games they did talk about,
2065000	2067000	they really relied on some of the third-party stuff.
2067000	2069000	You have a lot of online stuff.
2069000	2072000	Like, there's a reason why the focus from Square out the gate
2072000	2074000	was Crystal Chronicles remaster,
2074000	2076000	because that's the one you're going to play online,
2076000	2078000	not seven, not nine.
2078000	2080000	Online is the Crystal Chronicles remaster.
2080000	2082000	Diablo 3 was brought up again,
2082000	2084000	which we knew that that was probably originally going to be
2084000	2087000	part of some type of Nintendo online announcement.
2087000	2090000	But they announced it for Gamescom, and now we got this instead.
2090000	2092000	But they still talked about it to remind us that
2092000	2094000	Diablo 3 is going to be online.
2094000	2097000	And then they showed us that
2097000	2101000	that Deus Machina thing looked very online,
2101000	2103000	shooter-y type of thing, too.
2103000	2106000	So I'm surprised they didn't give us an update on Fortnite
2106000	2108000	or something on top of all this stuff.
2108000	2110000	Fortnite doesn't use it.
2110000	2112000	Oh yeah, that's right. That's right.
2112000	2114000	We didn't mention Fortnite during the online presentation,
2114000	2116000	because it doesn't need it.
2116000	2118000	Fortnite doesn't need it.
2118000	2122000	I still think Nintendo should have snuck it in there as a
2122000	2125000	this is the system to play Fortnite on you guys,
2125000	2128000	because, Loki, everybody's playing Fortnite.
2128000	2131000	Everybody is playing Fortnite.
2131000	2135000	So I went on a random trip to San Francisco this weekend,
2135000	2139000	and we went by the Microsoft store at the big mall there downtown,
2139000	2141000	ironically not far from the Metreon,
2141000	2143000	which used to be Sony's big thing.
2143000	2145000	But we were at the Microsoft store there,
2145000	2149000	and what is on all the laptops and all the game consoles,
2149000	2152000	and what are people playing that they could probably be playing on their phones
2152000	2154000	or they're playing Fortnite? They're all playing Fortnite.
2154000	2157000	And we were in the Razer store.
2157000	2160000	And in the Razer store, what's being demoed on the computers?
2160000	2164000	Fortnite. I mean, Fortnite is the game right now.
2165000	2168000	But it's, I mean, if this had been four or five years ago,
2168000	2169000	it would have been Minecraft.
2169000	2172000	You know, it's just, it's the hot shit of the moment.
2172000	2176000	So I'm just, I'm really surprised that Nintendo did not try to drop
2176000	2178000	a Fortnite thing in there somewhere. That's all.
2178000	2181000	That's the only thing with online, I'm just kind of surprised.
2181000	2184000	But otherwise, I like the Direct myself.
2184000	2186000	I thought there was a lot of good stuff in there.
2186000	2188000	So, kudos Nintendo.
2189000	2191000	Even though they had to push it back a week,
2191000	2193000	you know, because of the hurricane that happened,
2193000	2195000	I totally respect, but I respect what they had to do.
2195000	2197000	That's totally fine.
2197000	2200000	And interesting the effect that that had, though,
2200000	2203000	because the Civ 6 thing got leaked early because of that,
2203000	2206000	because, you know, somebody had a scheduled post
2206000	2208000	over at 2K or something to go up,
2208000	2210000	and it still went up even though the Direct got delayed.
2210000	2213000	So we all knew about Civ 6 a week early.
2213000	2215000	And then, you know, other little things, you know,
2215000	2217000	kind of started trickling out.
2217000	2220000	So it was just interesting to watch that effect
2220000	2222000	of what happened with the delay.
2222000	2224000	But certainly I understand why Nintendo delayed it.
2224000	2225000	Yeah.
2227000	2228000	And it gave us something to talk about this week.
2228000	2230000	All right, so anything else with the Nintendo Direct we need to talk about?
2230000	2233000	How about you guys in chat over at live.vognetwork.com?
2233000	2235000	They also mentioned, of course, you know,
2235000	2239000	there's this save, special, you know,
2239000	2241000	cloud saves that you can do.
2241000	2243000	One thing, though, about that, though,
2243000	2247000	is if you stop subscribing to the service, you lose the cloud saves.
2247000	2250000	And you might not be able to get that stuff back.
2250000	2252000	Which, on the other platforms, there is a six month window
2252000	2253000	in which you can access those.
2253000	2254000	Oh, that's good.
2254000	2257000	You're just going to have to know to pull them down
2257000	2259000	before your thing expires.
2259000	2262000	But you can't even back them up on a USB stick or anything.
2262000	2265000	You have to pull them down to your system and hope your system doesn't fry.
2265000	2266000	That's it.
2266000	2267000	It's stupid.
2267000	2271000	I think Nintendo could do a lot better with that.
2271000	2273000	They're worried about being hacked is what it is.
2273000	2275000	Too late! It's fucking too late for that.
2275000	2277000	Just who cares at this point?
2277000	2279000	Yeah. All right.
2279000	2281000	Before we get into our gaming weeks,
2281000	2284000	I want to talk a little bit about Dragon Con, actually.
2284000	2287000	So Dragon Con was so much fun. It was great.
2287000	2289000	I got to do a variety of panels.
2289000	2292000	I talked about all the panels I was going to moderate on the last show,
2292000	2295000	but I did a panel with Mass Effect voice actors.
2295000	2298000	That was kind of the first big gaming related thing that I did.
2298000	2301000	And that was really cool.
2301000	2303000	Even though the game is old at this point,
2303000	2306000	I mean, I say it's old because Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2
2306000	2307000	are like ten and eight years old.
2307000	2309000	These titles are aging.
2309000	2311000	There's still so much love for the series.
2311000	2314000	Mass Effect Andromeda only came up once,
2314000	2317000	to which the question asker was quickly reminded.
2317000	2320000	None of the people at the panel had anything to do with Andromeda.
2320000	2322000	So I actually kind of jumped in.
2322000	2325000	I see my role as moderator to kind of deflect some of the questions
2325000	2328000	from the celebrities when maybe it's something they don't want to get into.
2328000	2333000	So as the moderator, I kind of said my piece about Andromeda.
2333000	2335000	I think a lot of us were, and I've said it here on the show,
2335000	2337000	a lot of us were really rooting for that game, and it came out,
2337000	2339000	maybe it could have had a little more time in the oven,
2339000	2341000	and it's unfortunate they weren't given that time.
2341000	2345000	And the audience gave the applause that they agreed and all that stuff.
2345000	2348000	And we moved on from that, because that's that.
2348000	2351000	But lots of other, it's cool to hear about their other projects and things.
2351000	2354000	Courtney Taylor, who voices Jack in the game,
2354000	2357000	she works with this organization called Nerds Vote
2357000	2359000	that registers people to vote at conventions.
2359000	2361000	So I wanted to give that a shout out.
2361000	2363000	Hopefully at some point I can get her or somebody else
2363000	2365000	that works on that project here on the show to talk about that.
2365000	2368000	I would love to do that at a later date,
2368000	2370000	before the elections in November, obviously.
2370000	2374000	So a reminder, register to vote if you haven't already.
2374000	2375000	So that was really cool.
2375000	2378000	And then I did a panel with the voice actors
2378000	2380000	from Five Nights at Freddy's, sister location,
2380000	2382000	where we actually played through the game.
2382000	2385000	I didn't play, thankfully.
2385000	2388000	A Twitch streamer, her name is Panina Chan, shout out.
2388000	2390000	She did the actual playthrough.
2390000	2392000	They're live with the voice actors,
2392000	2395000	and it was actually a lot of fun because the whole audience,
2395000	2399000	I did not realize how many kids are in Five Nights at Freddy's.
2399000	2402000	Boy, did I underestimate how many kids are in Five Nights at Freddy's.
2402000	2404000	There's a new hotness on there, too, now.
2404000	2406000	My son's totally into ink.
2406000	2408000	Was it, God, what the fuck is it?
2408000	2410000	Something in the ink machine.
2410000	2412000	I don't remember what it's called, but it's basically like,
2412000	2414000	I think Mickey Mouse, but Five Nights at Freddy's.
2414000	2415000	Oh, no.
2415000	2419000	It's like, it's your child's first horror game.
2420000	2426000	So, yeah, I knew some kids were into it, but I was kind of surprised
2426000	2429000	that that was very much a family panel of people that showed up there.
2429000	2431000	It was like a lot of mixed ages there.
2431000	2434000	So, anyway, you know, we were playing through the game,
2434000	2435000	and the voice actors are fun.
2435000	2437000	We had some technical difficulties at the beginning,
2437000	2440000	so we just did a little bit of light bantering and did some audience questions.
2440000	2442000	A couple things struck me.
2442000	2444000	One, the voice actors, I mean, they were all great.
2444000	2445000	They were all gracious, obviously.
2445000	2448000	They're all very young, which is interesting when I'm like,
2448000	2452000	wow, you're like maybe 24 tops, and you've accomplished so much more
2452000	2455000	in your life than I have, but I thought they were great.
2455000	2457000	They were so professional and everything,
2457000	2458000	and they were messing with the audience.
2458000	2461000	There's this really tense thing where you're crawling through the air vents,
2461000	2465000	and then at one point, Kellen, who does the voice of Freddy Fazbear,
2465000	2469000	actually just did the voice very loudly in the mic and scared the audience,
2469000	2470000	and that was really funny.
2470000	2471000	We all had a laugh.
2471000	2474000	And then, of course, I don't know if she did it on purpose,
2474000	2476000	but we knew this had to happen at some point.
2476000	2480000	Penina Chan triggered a jump scare, and the whole audience was just like, ah!
2480000	2482000	And so that was a lot of fun, and of course,
2482000	2485000	the voice actors are giggling like crazy because they're all into it
2485000	2488000	and think it's funny, and I think one of them was actually legit scared, too,
2488000	2490000	because, you know, it's a scary game.
2490000	2492000	So I was even kind of looking away.
2492000	2494000	Bobby Blackwolf was really cool.
2494000	2498000	He came to all my panels, even though he wasn't necessarily co-hosting them,
2498000	2502000	but he was kind of like my emotional support kitten for all these different panels.
2502000	2505000	He's looking away from the screen like,
2505000	2506000	I know something bad is going to happen.
2506000	2507000	I'm not going to look at this.
2507000	2509000	I'm just not going to look at it.
2509000	2511000	So that was a lot of fun.
2511000	2513000	No, nothing came up on the movie.
2513000	2517000	I think somebody asked a question to them about did they want to be involved,
2517000	2522000	and you can imagine it was like, yes, we would love to be involved with the movie.
2522000	2528000	Please call us was kind of the direction that we got.
2528000	2532000	But sadly for them, I think some of these roles will probably go to,
2532000	2534000	you know, the typical movie actors you hear,
2534000	2537000	but hopefully they'll get to be involved in some way or another.
2537000	2543000	And then I did a Twitch 101 panel with one of the engineers from Twitch,
2543000	2544000	and she was great.
2544000	2548000	She was really nice, and we had a really good panel, really productive.
2548000	2551000	It was 101, so I was talking about Twitch, like, what is Twitch?
2551000	2555000	But there was a lot of people in the audience who had no knowledge of Twitch,
2555000	2556000	so I thought that was really cool.
2556000	2559000	And there were, of course, some affiliates and people of all levels in there,
2559000	2562000	but I think even for those people it was a really good networking opportunity
2562000	2564000	to meet other live streamers and stuff.
2564000	2569000	And even I learned, like, I had no idea Twitch had a whole creators' camp online
2569000	2572000	that helps you learn how to do this stuff, so I thought that was really cool.
2572000	2574000	So that was a really productive panel.
2574000	2579000	And then the last panel I did from the video game track was probably the biggest.
2579000	2584000	I did the Overwatch voice actors, and that was a huge ballroom
2584000	2588000	that was wired with cameras because that's one of the ballrooms
2588000	2591000	that can go on Dragon Con TV, which if you've never been to Dragon Con,
2591000	2596000	Dragon Con TV is available in all the host hotels in your room during the convention,
2596000	2602000	and they air select panels on Dragon Con TV so you can watch them in your room
2602000	2605000	so you don't have to try to go stand in line or whatever for these panels.
2605000	2608000	So if they have a big, like, John Barrowman, every year John Barrowman's there
2608000	2610000	and has a panel, it'll be on Dragon Con TV, right?
2610000	2612000	So if you want to watch that in your room, you can.
2612000	2614000	Now, my panel was not on Dragon Con TV.
2614000	2618000	I don't know if it's on the online version, it might be, I don't know,
2618000	2623000	but I think what happens is that if one of the other panels has a technical difficulty,
2623000	2626000	they will revert to something else.
2626000	2630000	So I think we might have been the B panel because all of our stuff was labeled.
2630000	2634000	You may be, like, what you don't see on the front of the card has my name on it.
2634000	2637000	On the back of the card, what I'm looking at, has a little thing that says,
2637000	2643000	smile, you might be on Dragon Con TV, and kind of like a reminder about language and stuff.
2643000	2645000	Don't pick your fucking nose.
2645000	2646000	Yeah, pretty much.
2646000	2648000	How'd you know? Don't pick your fucking nose.
2648000	2650000	No, it didn't say that.
2650000	2655000	But anyway, Bobby Blackwell says it is most likely on the online version.
2655000	2659000	So I guess we'll have to, maybe I'll have to pony up the ten bucks and check that out.
2659000	2661000	I don't know, but here's the funny thing.
2661000	2664000	I know a bootleg is out there because I searched YouTube when I got home
2664000	2666000	and there was a bootleg of the panel out there.
2666000	2668000	So it was big enough to be bootlegged.
2668000	2672000	But all those voice actresses were, and it was all women,
2672000	2678000	because they were all the voice actresses of Diva, Symmetra, and Mercy were there.
2678000	2681000	And they were all super nice and great.
2681000	2684000	And the questions, there was a really, really good question.
2684000	2686000	And, like, let me tell you this.
2686000	2691000	Like, I have to be professional as a moderator and try very hard not to be a big fanboy.
2691000	2694000	But I was about to, let me tell you when I was about to, like,
2694000	2696000	just jump up and give one of these people a hug.
2696000	2699000	Anjali, who does the voice of Symmetra,
2699000	2705000	she got a question about what would be the charity skin that you would do?
2705000	2709000	Because, like, Mercy had the breast cancer awareness skin, right?
2709000	2713000	So the question was, what would be the skin that you would want to do and what would it look like?
2713000	2717000	And Anjali's answer said, well, I think it would be very obvious that Symmetra's
2717000	2721000	should do something for an autism charity and autism awareness.
2721000	2724000	And, you know, she wanted her charity to be that.
2724000	2729000	And she wanted the skin for Symmetra to be something that was like a world or global
2729000	2736000	and something that was very inclusive because autism isn't always something that you see.
2736000	2738000	There's all these different levels.
2738000	2741000	There's all these types of people that are dealing with all different levels of autism.
2741000	2745000	And it's an issue that can affect so many people.
2745000	2751000	And she had such an eloquent answer that I'm not really relaying appropriately here on this program.
2752000	2756000	I'm not giving that answer the eloquence that she gave it.
2756000	2760000	But I really just want to jump up and give her a big hug and say that was like the best answer
2760000	2762000	you could have possibly given to that question.
2762000	2765000	And I was moved by that.
2765000	2768000	So that was my favorite part of that whole panel, by the way, if you're curious,
2768000	2771000	was that particular question and answer.
2771000	2773000	NSG100Matt says, yeah, that was well thought out.
2773000	2776000	Make it happen, Blizzard. Yes, I agree.
2776000	2781000	So anyway, yeah, that was a great panel.
2781000	2784000	And then I didn't even really talk about it.
2784000	2789000	And just for time's sake, I probably won't get into it because that's a little more shop on the podcasting track.
2789000	2793000	And the video game track stuff, with the exception of the ballroom panel,
2793000	2795000	if you weren't there, you can't see it.
2795000	2797000	It wasn't taped or anything.
2797000	2802000	But the podcasting track or now in the future digital media creation,
2802000	2805000	that all streamed on Facebook Live and all those panels are available to see on Facebook Live.
2805000	2808000	So if you want to go check that out, and I encourage you to,
2808000	2813000	you can check that out on the Digital Media Creators DragonCon page over on Facebook.
2813000	2816000	So yeah, lots of fun panels there as well.
2816000	2819000	But anyway, I do want to move on for time's sake.
2819000	2821000	I want to get into a little bit of our gaming weeks.
2821000	2826000	And then I want to talk a little bit about one other thing that kind of traces back to DragonCon,
2826000	2829000	but it has to do with the future of OLR. I'll get to that in a minute.
2829000	2831000	Nothing bad. Don't worry.
2831000	2833000	Most of you already know what it is.
2833000	2836000	Not everybody may have heard this yet if you're not listening to Bobby Blackwell
2836000	2838000	or you weren't following all the DragonCon news.
2838000	2839000	So I want to get into that in just a minute.
2839000	2841000	But first, let's talk about our gaming weeks.
2841000	2843000	And how was your gaming week, Loki?
2843000	2845000	I did play a few things.
2845000	2849000	So I made it out to the arcade at one point to go.
2849000	2851000	I had some time to kill.
2851000	2855000	And so I went and played Danson's Revolution Ace.
2855000	2858000	And so I got to play a little bit of that.
2858000	2861000	Not very long, though, because I had to go pick up my kids.
2861000	2863000	But I got to play through a few songs of that.
2863000	2865000	And the interface is really confusing.
2865000	2869000	Luckily, the dude there spot me in games because he had put a ton of money into the machine,
2869000	2873000	which is kind of bad form or whatever for games.
2873000	2875000	So I got to play that a bit.
2875000	2877000	And I don't know.
2877000	2881000	I don't understand necessarily the new step charts too much.
2881000	2888000	New York Face is all right, but there's a definite change in how it is.
2888000	2892000	I like how everything kind of defaults to the solo arrows and stuff.
2892000	2894000	So it's a little bit easier to see.
2894000	2897000	I was going into the options and like, OK, I see speed options.
2897000	2900000	Where's my arrow options that I'm used to on my extreme machine?
2900000	2902000	Oh, it's not here.
2902000	2904000	OK, well, fuck it. I'll just play without it.
2904000	2906000	Oh, hey, the arrows look like that anyway.
2906000	2908000	So that was cool.
2908000	2910000	So I played a couple games of that.
2910000	2914000	And then I did download the demo for Mega Man 11.
2914000	2916000	And I played through that.
2916000	2918000	That was pretty fun.
2918000	2923000	I also picked up a game that I talked about on Twitter before
2923000	2925000	called Old School Musical.
2925000	2931000	And it's like a throwback to old school NES 16-bit games as well.
2931000	2938000	And it's this whole story about these two creatures, Robin.
2938000	2941000	I'm trying to remember the other guy's name.
2941000	2946000	But anyways, they basically have to figure out what's going on
2946000	2948000	with this world that they're in.
2948000	2951000	And so the whole game is played as a rhythm game.
2951000	2954000	And so you kind of watch as they go through different levels
2954000	2957000	that are like a Mega Man level or Metal Gear level
2957000	2959000	or Metal Slug or something like that.
2959000	2961000	And it's just kind of silly.
2961000	2964000	They have this weird thing that has to do with glitches
2964000	2966000	and chickens and stuff like that.
2966000	2968000	So I played through actually the whole game.
2968000	2970000	I've already beaten it because it doesn't take too long to get through.
2970000	2973000	It's only a rhythm game, so it's like two hours or so.
2973000	2979000	But then they have this other part that's this chicken mode
2979000	2983000	that you have to go through that you play through a bunch of songs.
2983000	2985000	And that takes a lot longer, and it's a lot harder
2985000	2990000	because they have modifiers that appear on your play field.
2990000	2992000	So it makes it a lot harder to distract you
2992000	2997000	or to make it harder to see the stuff that you're supposed to be doing.
2998000	3001000	So, very funny game.
3001000	3003000	They have lots of parodies for different things.
3003000	3011000	I posted an image on Twitter where they have a Sydney parody that's Sid.
3011000	3015000	So it's an old man dressed up like Sidney from Final Fantasy XV.
3015000	3017000	Scantily clad and everything. It's hilarious.
3017000	3018000	Nice.
3018000	3020000	And like your characters several times.
3020000	3025000	The younger brothers actually of these two guys is the larger of the two.
3025000	3027000	And so it kind of throws you off a little bit,
3027000	3030000	but he keeps getting dressed in female clothing.
3030000	3033000	Like in the Metal Gear level, he's dressed up like
3033000	3035000	oh god, I can't remember her name,
3035000	3037000	but Scantily clad like in Metal Gear Solid 5.
3037000	3038000	Oh, Q or whatever her name was?
3038000	3039000	Quest. Quiet.
3039000	3041000	Quiet, yes. Dressed up like quiet.
3041000	3043000	Gender is a construct, tear it apart.
3043000	3048000	It's just hilarious. It's funny, though, because he's talking about
3048000	3050000	why you keep getting dressed up like that.
3050000	3052000	He's like, whatever, I'm working it.
3052000	3054000	Yes, bitch, slay!
3054000	3058000	It's funny because he gets dressed up like Princess Zelda at one time.
3058000	3063000	Oh yeah, there's one level you have to find this guy named Clint,
3063000	3067000	which is obviously Link because the chickens have taken him away
3067000	3069000	for torturing chickens.
3069000	3073000	So very tongue-in-cheek video game references in a don't sue me kind of way.
3073000	3075000	Yeah, it's pretty cool.
3075000	3080000	And a lot of the music, too, has kind of like throwbacks to those songs as well.
3080000	3084000	And they have a lot of cool stuff in there, so definitely go check it out.
3084000	3086000	I picked it up on both platforms.
3086000	3090000	I meant to play it on the Switch, and then my kids demanded I give them the Switch
3090000	3094000	like immediately after I bought it, and I'm ready to play it and stuff.
3094000	3097000	And then my son decides he's going to do homework sitting behind me.
3097000	3099000	I'm like, motherfucker, you know?
3099000	3101000	How dare you do your homework?
3101000	3103000	How dare you do your homework?
3103000	3105000	And they're like, I want to play something on the Switch.
3105000	3107000	I'm like, oh, god damn it, you know, so fine.
3107000	3112000	So I had to buy it on PC, and I beat it through on PC, and I downloaded the...
3112000	3116000	They have some DLC for it as well, but it's like additional tracks.
3116000	3119000	It's all chiptunes, so it's pretty awesome.
3119000	3121000	But definitely worth checking out.
3121000	3124000	It gets pretty difficult, too, as you play through the game.
3124000	3128000	And I'm only playing on normal, and there's a difficult mode as well that's even harder.
3128000	3130000	So definitely worth checking out.
3130000	3132000	It's a great game.
3132000	3135000	You need a game, too, so that's pretty cool.
3135000	3138000	And then, what else did I play?
3138000	3140000	I don't remember.
3140000	3143000	I think that was pretty much it.
3143000	3147000	Yeah, just DDR Extreme at home.
3147000	3150000	Yeah, I think that was it.
3150000	3152000	I installed some other stuff.
3152000	3155000	Well, I played a lot of the LEGO Ninjago game,
3155000	3160000	because my son keeps having me pass through different parts of that game for him.
3160000	3162000	So I played a bit of that.
3162000	3164000	Oh, I remember.
3164000	3166000	What else?
3166000	3170000	I don't know if I played... I picked up Galaga and Double Peace because it was on sale.
3170000	3173000	It's kind of a weird shooter game.
3173000	3176000	I played it on the Xbox 360 at one time,
3176000	3179000	but I haven't gotten a chance to play through much of that.
3179000	3182000	But it's just like I remember. It's just silly. Weird.
3182000	3186000	Very innuendo.
3186000	3189000	Oh, and then I think I mentioned that I beat Donut Country.
3189000	3191000	I don't remember.
3191000	3194000	No, we haven't been here for a little bit.
3194000	3197000	Donut Country was another game. That's the one that's like Katamari.
3197000	3201000	It's basically this raccoon that has this tablet,
3201000	3205000	and he opens a donut shop, and he thinks that he is...
3205000	3209000	When people order a donut from him, he delivers a hole
3209000	3212000	that basically sucks up all their trash.
3212000	3215000	Which, to him, everything is trash.
3215000	3217000	So he sucks up all their stuff.
3217000	3219000	And so it's talking about this,
3219000	3222000	kind of flashing back to how they all ended up in this hole,
3222000	3224000	or donut.
3224000	3225000	And so...
3225000	3227000	A donut hole?
3227000	3230000	Yeah, and so they...
3230000	3234000	It's just a silly thing it has to do with the king of the raccoons and stuff like that.
3234000	3237000	It's just this weird game, but it's a little bit like Katamari,
3237000	3241000	but a little bit more linear
3241000	3243000	because there's no real time limit.
3243000	3247000	You just have this hole that gets bigger as you drop things into it,
3247000	3249000	and you have to solve some puzzles with that.
3249000	3253000	Not a whole... It's not a very difficult game, but it's fun.
3253000	3256000	It's got that kind of charm to it that Katamari has.
3256000	3258000	Wait, I have to know if this is a reference to the game.
3258000	3259000	Puba in our chat room says,
3259000	3261000	Loki, have a garbage day.
3261000	3262000	Yes, that's...
3262000	3264000	Okay, I was like, is that a reference to the game,
3264000	3267000	or did somebody just literally come into chat to tell you to have a bat?
3267000	3270000	Because either way, I'm okay with that comment.
3270000	3272000	Every level has the same thing.
3272000	3274000	It's the raccoon thing. It's like, have a garbage day.
3274000	3277000	Okay, okay, that's funny. I like that.
3277000	3280000	But also, have a garbage day.
3280000	3284000	So that was it. Yeah, that was all I played this week.
3284000	3286000	Alright, let me talk about my gaming week.
3286000	3288000	For my gaming week, I've done a lot.
3288000	3293000	So when I was at Dragon Con, Bobby had his whole setup there at Dragon Con with VR.
3293000	3296000	So he had the HTC Vive, which sadly not...
3296000	3300000	I didn't play it as much this year as I did previous years,
3300000	3303000	but again, probably just because we were busy.
3303000	3305000	I had eight panels and Bobby had six.
3305000	3307000	Granted, there was a little bit of overlap,
3307000	3312000	but when he wasn't being my emotional support animal at my panels,
3312000	3313000	I was being his.
3313000	3316000	So we were very busy.
3316000	3318000	But we did get to do some VR playing,
3318000	3321000	and he had me play Beat Saber for the first time,
3321000	3323000	which I got to play on the HTC Vive.
3323000	3326000	As a music game fan, I loved Beat Saber. It was so fun.
3326000	3329000	You would love this game, Loki, if you haven't checked it out.
3330000	3333000	They are, and I think that's when most people will really get to check it out.
3333000	3334000	But it was so fun.
3334000	3336000	What's interesting about it,
3336000	3338000	and Bobby was explaining this to me because I didn't know this,
3338000	3341000	but did you know that it's not like DDR in the way that it grades you,
3341000	3343000	or like Beat Mini 2DX?
3343000	3346000	It's not 100% about when you smash the note,
3346000	3349000	but a lot of the flourish that you do...
3349000	3351000	Like, did you just go...
3351000	3353000	Did you just move your hand slightly to break it,
3353000	3357000	or did you do a big, graceful swing of the sword
3357000	3359000	that followed through and broke it?
3359000	3361000	Because if you do more movement, you get more points,
3361000	3363000	which I think is kind of neat.
3363000	3367000	Of course, Perfect Attack, people are very upset about it
3367000	3369000	and write angry things on the internet,
3369000	3372000	but I think it's their game. They can do whatever they want.
3372000	3376000	I think the flourishes go with a lot of the music that's in the game,
3376000	3379000	and it has a really cool movement to it.
3379000	3382000	On one hand, I kind of wish you could have seen me play that.
3382000	3384000	On the other hand, I'm very thankful that Bobby
3384000	3386000	did not try to livestream video of me playing that game
3386000	3388000	because it is still a little embarrassing,
3388000	3390000	but it's a lot of fun to play.
3390000	3395000	It's like a must-have VR type of thing.
3395000	3397000	And what's interesting is that at one of the panels
3397000	3400000	Bobby was doing, the point came up is that
3400000	3404000	could Beat Saber be done on a TV in a non-VR environment?
3404000	3409000	And it's one of those, well, I mean, technically, sure.
3409000	3412000	You could use your mouse and all that and play.
3412000	3414000	It's not going to be the same thing at all.
3414000	3416000	Like the experience would not...
3416000	3418000	Even with motion controllers, it would just not...
3418000	3420000	No, it really wouldn't. It really wouldn't.
3420000	3423000	There's something about having it right in front of you
3423000	3425000	and really being able to see...
3425000	3427000	Are you telling me I can't do this with Kinect?
3427000	3429000	Because Kinect can do everything.
3429000	3432000	I'm thinking no. I'm thinking you're better off
3432000	3435000	not trying to do this in Kinect, so there you go.
3435000	3438000	And Bobby Blackwolf is in our chat and says,
3438000	3440000	you need the 3D positions of the visuals.
3440000	3442000	It's not about the controls, but the visuals.
3442000	3444000	And I would agree with that for sure.
3444000	3447000	So, yeah, that was Beat Saber. I really enjoyed it.
3447000	3450000	It would be cool if maybe there was a few more songs,
3450000	3453000	but as I understand it, the game is in early access,
3453000	3456000	so that really shouldn't be a critical point at this time.
3456000	3459000	I just hope that when they release on PlayStation,
3459000	3462000	maybe they'll get a few more songs.
3462000	3464000	But all right, depending on how much they charge for it,
3464000	3467000	I'm sure it'll still be fine on VR.
3467000	3470000	Maybe they'll add more to it later, that whole time.
3470000	3472000	That's probably what they've been doing,
3472000	3473000	is kind of adding as they go.
3473000	3476000	Bobby does point out that people have modded in songs,
3476000	3478000	but they're just doing like expert hell songs.
3478000	3481000	Yes, like the full Shrek movie audio track.
3481000	3485000	Okay, for the lolz, okay, funny,
3485000	3488000	but as a practical, would I play this at a party?
3488000	3491000	No, this doesn't work. So, anyway.
3491000	3495000	And YYR in chat says it'll probably remain in early access
3495000	3497000	until it's got a good list, like 30 to 40 at least.
3497000	3499000	Okay, cool. Cool.
3499000	3501000	All right, let's talk about other games I've played this week.
3501000	3504000	So when I got home, my copy of Dragon Quest XI was waiting for me.
3504000	3507000	So I've been playing through Dragon Quest XI on PlayStation 4.
3507000	3509000	God, I forget where I'm at.
3509000	3511000	I don't want to ruin the story too much,
3511000	3514000	but I just, the sisters just joined my party.
3514000	3516000	That should be vague enough.
3516000	3517000	It's not really spoiling anything,
3517000	3518000	but that's about where I'm at in the game.
3518000	3521000	It's about seven to eight hours in to the game.
3521000	3523000	So, I mean, it's a Dragon Quest game.
3523000	3524000	It's going to move a little slower.
3524000	3526000	It's going to be a very long game, like 100 hours.
3526000	3528000	Here's the interesting thing about Dragon Quest.
3528000	3530000	I don't think this series has changed at all, really,
3530000	3532000	since the last Dragon Quest game I played,
3532000	3534000	which is Dragon Quest VIII on the PlayStation 2.
3534000	3536000	I didn't really play IX.
3536000	3539000	X was online and never released here, so I couldn't.
3539000	3544000	So, I mean, it hasn't really seemed to have changed much since Dragon Quest VIII.
3544000	3546000	But I think that's okay.
3546000	3548000	That's kind of what people want.
3548000	3552000	Like, Dragon Quest is that series that hasn't changed a lot.
3552000	3555000	I mean, okay, they have the pep system in there now,
3555000	3557000	and you can run around in spots.
3557000	3564000	They haven't changed where, like, Final Fantasy XIII radically changed the battle system, right?
3564000	3566000	And some people liked it, some people hated it.
3566000	3568000	Dragon Quest XI didn't do that to you.
3568000	3572000	It's still, you know, fight, item, run, you know, those basic types of things.
3572000	3576000	That is the JRPG a lot of people want to play.
3576000	3579000	Exactly. Square Enix.
3579000	3583000	So, you know what? Well, I mean, Dragon Quest XI is a Square Enix game.
3583000	3588000	I know, but they have a whole other series of games called Final Fantasy,
3588000	3592000	where they're like, no, let's change up the battle system yet again.
3592000	3595000	Well, I think that's the difference between these two franchises.
3595000	3597000	Final Fantasy is going to be a little different,
3597000	3600000	and it's going to push the envelope with graphics and sound and all that,
3600000	3604000	whereas Dragon Quest XI is going to be, you know, the tired and true.
3604000	3606000	And that's not to knock it at all.
3606000	3608000	Like, I'm enjoying the story so far.
3608000	3610000	They put voice acting in it, which the Japanese version didn't have.
3610000	3612000	Did you know that?
3612000	3615000	There's some hilarious tweets that are like, where's the Japanese voice acting?
3615000	3617000	Punchline. There wasn't any.
3617000	3619000	They added the voice acting for the U.S. version.
3619000	3622000	This is the international version, you know, because it's been out in Japan for a year.
3622000	3625000	So they added the voice acting in for the U.S. version.
3625000	3627000	They didn't release the Switch version, though, which is interesting,
3627000	3631000	because there is a Switch version, or supposed to be.
3631000	3633000	No, I think there is one in Japan.
3633000	3635000	For whatever reason, they didn't release it here yet.
3635000	3638000	I don't know if the voice acting had something to do with that or what it is.
3638000	3641000	There's also a 3DS version they didn't release here,
3641000	3643000	which is interesting.
3643000	3647000	You know, again, maybe because they would have had to not be able to add some of the stuff they did.
3647000	3651000	I don't know. I can only play the game that they did release, which is on PlayStation 4.
3651000	3655000	And again, if you like Dragon Quest games, this game will satisfy you.
3655000	3658000	However, I'm going to read this game on one thing.
3658000	3660000	I'm going to tell you what the worst part of the game is.
3660000	3662000	And this might surprise you.
3662000	3664000	Because this is the part of the game...
3664000	3669000	I can't think of a game in a long time
3669000	3671000	where I've said this is the worst part of the game.
3671000	3675000	You ready? You know what the worst part of Dragon Quest XI is?
3675000	3677000	The soundtrack.
3677000	3679000	That's right. And I know.
3679000	3686000	They have an old-school composer that's been doing this franchise for a long time.
3686000	3689000	They have a symphonic rendition that opens the game,
3689000	3693000	except once you're in the game, you no longer have the symphonic renditions.
3693000	3695000	It's like a MIDI rendering.
3695000	3699000	Honestly, the game fucking sounds like it's on my AdLib sound card in 1994.
3699000	3704000	Which, I guess in some ways is kind of cool, but this is Dragon Quest XI, people.
3704000	3706000	And the songs are just...
3706000	3708000	They're not good.
3708000	3713000	It relies a lot on the retro kitsch of
3713000	3716000	we've been doing this stuff the same way for a long time.
3716000	3719000	Even retro songs can sound good.
3719000	3721000	Yeah, it doesn't here, Logie. It just doesn't.
3721000	3724000	So that's the one part of the game I'm going to read.
3724000	3727000	Not everybody's going to agree with me there.
3727000	3730000	Some people haven't already on Twitter, and that's fine.
3730000	3733000	But for me, I just wanted more out of the soundtrack,
3733000	3736000	especially when you have such a name behind...
3736000	3738000	Why didn't they do the symphony for everything?
3738000	3740000	It probably cost a lot of money. I don't know.
3740000	3747000	But I do know Final Fantasy, even though nothing was wrong with Nobui Matsu per se,
3747000	3750000	they've used some newer, some different composers lately,
3750000	3753000	and there's been some great music still produced for Final Fantasy.
3753000	3756000	Especially in the case of Final Fantasy XIV.
3756000	3758000	Y'all know I love XIV's soundtrack.
3758000	3760000	XIV is doing it right.
3760000	3763000	Dragon Quest XI is doing it wrong.
3763000	3765000	So, anyway.
3765000	3768000	Bobby wanted you to review Ready Player One.
3768000	3770000	Oh, yeah. Okay.
3770000	3773000	Yeah, well, and this is for your benefit, too.
3773000	3776000	Okay, so going back to Dragon Con, I stayed an extra day this year
3776000	3779000	so that I wouldn't be rushing back on Labor Day.
3779000	3781000	And this way I also got to see Bobby in Jennifer's house
3781000	3784000	because I didn't get to see that when I was out there for the wedding.
3784000	3787000	And I think I'm allowed to talk about this.
3787000	3788000	If not, sorry.
3788000	3791000	But I think he did say I could talk about his theater.
3791000	3796000	So he actually converted part of his basement into a theater, and it's nice.
3796000	3798000	He has 4K projection.
3798000	3801000	He has the couches that Jamie has in her house,
3801000	3806000	with the big old cup holders and things like that that are movie recliner seats.
3806000	3809000	He has that, but he has them on the steps
3809000	3812000	so that he actually has a back row and a front row.
3812000	3815000	So it's like a movie theater, so it's like a six-seat movie theater.
3815000	3818000	And so he actually played a little bit of Horza Horizon 3
3818000	3820000	on that 4K projector on his Xbox One X.
3820000	3822000	And I was like, this is hot.
3822000	3824000	This is really hot.
3824000	3827000	This is the way to game. This is awesome.
3827000	3829000	So, of course, we had to watch something.
3829000	3831000	Let's put that movie theater to use, right?
3831000	3833000	Bobby has a guest over. Let's do something.
3833000	3836000	So we decided to watch Ready Player One because I still hadn't seen it.
3836000	3840000	I will give you this, Loki. It didn't suck. I didn't hate it.
3840000	3843000	It's kind of like how you felt about Nintendo's press conference.
3843000	3845000	I didn't hate it.
3845000	3849000	It was fine. I wasn't like, oh my god.
3849000	3853000	But I was like, okay, for a big popcorn, fun, dumb movie,
3853000	3856000	I was like, it was cool. I was into it.
3856000	3858000	It's not going to win any Oscars.
3858000	3859000	Of course not.
3859000	3861000	But for dumb, fun popcorn, it was cool.
3861000	3865000	Some of those scenes, the graphics, the visuals,
3865000	3869000	that racing scene right in the very beginning, that was really impressive.
3869000	3872000	They did a lot of stuff with that that was really cool.
3872000	3876000	It was a long movie. That was one thing I noticed.
3876000	3878000	It really started to be long.
3878000	3882000	There were some issues with the plot, but nothing too much.
3882000	3884000	Well, they kind of abridged it from the book.
3884000	3886000	I heard they really changed it.
3886000	3890000	That's not really an excuse, though, because the author of the book
3890000	3893000	also kind of helped write the screenplay.
3897000	3901000	Bobby points out that his studio, and I always forget this,
3901000	3905000	his theater has Dolby Atmos sound with two speakers in the ceiling,
3905000	3907000	so the race sounds amazing. It did.
3907000	3909000	That's probably part of what really made it.
3909000	3910000	Now, here's the thing.
3910000	3913000	Going back, we made the right choice,
3913000	3916000	and we really do need to watch Ready Player One.
3916000	3917000	Here's the thing.
3917000	3920000	If I do this again next year, and I stay an extra day next year,
3920000	3922000	not that I'm inviting myself to Bobby's house next year,
3922000	3925000	but there's a part of me that says he probably wouldn't care.
3925000	3928000	I feel like the movie we should have watched is Tron Legacy.
3928000	3929000	Well, yes.
3929000	3932000	So maybe that'll have to be next year's selection.
3932000	3934000	I don't know, assuming there's no...
3934000	3936000	Because now I'm like, oh, wow, I wonder what...
3936000	3939000	You know, thinking about racing scenes and sound and everything like that,
3939000	3942000	I'm like, oh, God, Tron Legacy would have been so badass.
3942000	3943000	Anyway.
3945000	3947000	Oh, Bobby Blackwolf says,
3947000	3950000	I only have Tron on DVD, and DVDs don't look the best on that screen,
3950000	3951000	even upscaled.
3951000	3954000	Tron Legacy doesn't have the Atmos sound mix,
3954000	3956000	but I'd still use 5.1.
3956000	3960000	And he's officially invited me in chat to stay again after DragonCon next year.
3960000	3964000	I have the original Tron on Blu-ray and the Tron Legacy on Blu-ray.
3964000	3966000	Yeah, I was gonna say, I could actually bring my...
3966000	3969000	I do have Tron, because I bought that big pack...
3969000	3970000	Yeah, the collector's edition.
3970000	3972000	That had, like, all the Trons in it.
3972000	3973000	All two of them.
3973000	3977000	Well, no, I said all the Trons, because it had the original Tron,
3977000	3980000	Tron Legacy, and it had the Tron Legacy 3D disc in it, too.
3980000	3981000	Yes.
3981000	3982000	They were on separate discs.
3982000	3983000	The 2D and 3D were separate.
3983000	3986000	Still haven't watched that yet on my PlayStation VR.
3986000	3987000	Yeah.
3987000	3988000	So, all right.
3988000	3989000	So, anyway.
3990000	3991000	Where were we?
3991000	3994000	So, yes, that was another thing I got to do while I was visiting Bobby.
3994000	3995000	So, other games.
3996000	3997000	We still have news to get into.
3997000	3999000	This is what happens when we miss two weeks.
3999000	4000000	Sorry.
4000000	4001000	Anyway.
4001000	4004000	I've been playing Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch as well, continuing on those.
4004000	4006000	That's all I need to say about that.
4006000	4008000	I've been playing the new World of Warcraft expansion.
4008000	4011000	I don't know what the fuck came over me, but I was just like...
4011000	4014000	Final Fantasy XIV is kind of in a lull right now.
4014000	4017000	There are big patches until Tuesday, and, like,
4017000	4020000	I'm not really playing online with anyone in that game right now,
4020000	4023000	and all I see on Twitter are all my friends playing World of War...
4023000	4024000	Wow, what the fuck?
4024000	4025000	I'll just renew World of Warcraft.
4025000	4026000	I'll play that for a little bit.
4026000	4028000	And the expansion is fine.
4028000	4032000	But, like, the Horde zone that I'm playing in, Zandalar or whatever,
4032000	4035000	with the big, like, Mayan temple-inspired thing,
4035000	4037000	it's a bitch to navigate,
4037000	4040000	and I hate that you don't have flying in a zone like that.
4040000	4042000	That's my, like, I know that's, like, a weird criticism,
4042000	4044000	but that's, like, my one criticism so far,
4044000	4047000	is that, like, I hate the zone design.
4047000	4048000	I guess that's the criticism.
4048000	4051000	I hate the zone design of that zone.
4051000	4052000	Maybe it gets better.
4052000	4054000	Everybody tells me the Alliance one is way better.
4054000	4057000	I mean, I don't know how much of that is faction bias or whatever,
4057000	4059000	but I'm just saying, since I started with the Horde character,
4059000	4062000	I wasn't too impressed with that particular zone.
4062000	4066000	But what I am impressed with is that I'm, like, dang,
4066000	4069000	like, here's a cinematic, there's a cinematic,
4069000	4070000	here's another cinematic.
4070000	4073000	I remember when, like, the WoW cinematic was your reward
4073000	4076000	for, like, beating the Lich King, the final boss in the game.
4076000	4079000	You got a cinematic, and you got your one cinematic.
4079000	4082000	Now it's, like, dang, they have one, like, for every little thing that happens.
4082000	4086000	And I thought the scenarios that really explain the backstory
4086000	4089000	about why we're on these new islands
4089000	4091000	and why the Horde and Alliance are super fighting again,
4091000	4093000	I thought that was really well done as well.
4093000	4095000	Except the one thing I don't understand,
4095000	4097000	and maybe this is just because I didn't play Legion to completion,
4097000	4100000	so I will fault myself for this a little bit,
4100000	4102000	but one thing I kind of didn't understand is, like,
4102000	4107000	why did Sylvanas just all of a sudden become, like, a crazy person?
4107000	4110000	Like, I understand maybe she was, like, a little crazy before,
4110000	4113000	but why is she all of a sudden, like, really fucking me?
4113000	4118000	It kind of feels like a rehash of what happened to Garrosh in Pandaria,
4118000	4121000	and so that's the only reason why I'm kind of calling it out,
4121000	4124000	is I feel like I'm, like, this feels like territory we've been to before.
4124000	4127000	Is Sylvanas going to be the last boss of the expansion?
4127000	4130000	Because if so, that's kind of dippy, because we've seen that before.
4130000	4134000	So we'll see, though. That's a very minor read.
4134000	4136000	I don't know. We'll see how long I stick with it,
4136000	4139000	but so far I guess I'm having a good enough time with it. We'll see.
4139000	4142000	Anyway, that's it. That's it for my gaming week.
4142000	4145000	Okay, we're going to get into news, but I need to go over one other topic.
4145000	4147000	So this is, not everybody's heard this yet,
4147000	4151000	so one thing, we did announce a DragonCon at one of the panels,
4151000	4153000	and so we talked about it a little bit in Discord,
4153000	4156000	which you can join our Discord anytime at vognetwork.com slash Discord,
4156000	4158000	and it was on Twitter and so forth,
4158000	4160000	but I realize there are many of you out there
4160000	4163000	who only download the Orange Rounds Radio podcast every week,
4163000	4166000	and you don't necessarily interact with the show a lot outside of listening to it,
4166000	4168000	which is cool. Like, I'm super happy that you're listening,
4168000	4171000	so thank you, thank you for downloading the show and just giving it a try in the first place.
4171000	4174000	So I realize there's a lot of you that haven't heard the news, so what is the news?
4174000	4177000	The news is that Orange Rounds Radio is going to be moving a little bit
4177000	4180000	by the end of the year. I don't have a date yet.
4180000	4184000	It's not, vognetwork is still a thing, so it's not that kind of move.
4184000	4189000	What is going to be changing is that we're no longer going to be using Shoutcast
4189000	4193000	as the platform that we do our live presentation on Sunday nights.
4193000	4196000	So really, since 2002,
4196000	4200000	this is something that hasn't changed since 2002 when OLR started.
4200000	4207000	For the past 16 years, you used Shoutcast, a Winamp-type plug-in, to do this show.
4207000	4210000	I mean, technically in the live 365 years we had a live,
4210000	4214000	but it was a fancier Shoutcast plug-in. That's all it was, okay?
4214000	4217000	So we've used Shoutcast to deliver this show for 16 years.
4217000	4220000	And y'all know if you do the same thing the same way all the time,
4220000	4222000	you're going to get the same results.
4222000	4225000	And we're not getting a lot of new listeners to OLR.
4225000	4227000	You know, we get some, and I'm very thankful.
4227000	4229000	Some of you take to heart what I say at the end of every show,
4229000	4231000	and you do tell a friend or two about the show.
4231000	4233000	Some people find us through social media or when we're live.
4233000	4239000	But we haven't really, really expanded our audience a lot in several years.
4239000	4242000	And so I think in order to do that,
4242000	4247000	I think we're going to have to really evaluate is Shoutcast really the best platform,
4247000	4250000	or is there another thing that could give us greater visibility?
4250000	4254000	Is there another thing that could really expand the reach and accessibility
4254000	4258000	of something like OLR and Bobby Black Wolf and Anime Jam Session
4258000	4261000	and the other live shows that are on VOG Network?
4261000	4266000	And so we made a decision that we're going to change from a Shoutcast show
4266000	4269000	to a Twitch show. That's right, Twitch.
4269000	4272000	So same thing that a lot of people stream their video games on,
4272000	4275000	but you also know they have an IRL channel,
4275000	4278000	and they do channels where people will tape live shows.
4278000	4280000	Sometimes these are like podcasts.
4280000	4283000	Sometimes it's the host kind of BSing with their audience for a while.
4283000	4285000	That's the type of thing that it is.
4285000	4289000	So instead of using Shoutcast to deliver the show, it's going to be Twitch.
4289000	4291000	However, there's always going to be people,
4291000	4293000	especially after you've done something one way for 16 years,
4293000	4295000	there's always going to be people that are like,
4295000	4299000	but change, but I like the old way. This is what works for me.
4299000	4302000	Well, here's the thing. We want to try something new.
4302000	4305000	And so this is going to be a new thing that we're trying.
4305000	4309000	But I don't want you to feel like the show is going to change. It's not.
4309000	4312000	Yes, there will be video available on Twitch.
4312000	4315000	You will see video of us doing a radio show.
4315000	4316000	So I want to make that very clear.
4316000	4318000	Orange Launch Radio is not becoming...
4318000	4319000	No!
4319000	4321000	Said Jamie.
4321000	4324000	Actually, Jamie, we wouldn't have done this if Jamie wasn't cool with it.
4324000	4325000	She's fine with it, you know?
4325000	4329000	And remember, y'all, we've already done this.
4329000	4333000	We did this when Justin TV was a thing.
4333000	4336000	And OLR, like the show that you're hearing, didn't change.
4336000	4339000	It was just that, oh, you could watch it on Justin TV.
4339000	4340000	I need some better lighting in here.
4340000	4343000	Yeah, this room's going to change a little bit before that happens.
4343000	4344000	But we'll get there.
4344000	4349000	Anyway, my point is that because I don't want people to be freaked out.
4349000	4351000	They're like, oh my God, Orange Launch Radio is going to change.
4351000	4353000	It's a TV thing now. I can't watch it.
4353000	4356000	That's okay. We're still recording a podcast.
4356000	4360000	And it's still going to be the same podcast that you're used to.
4360000	4363000	Because I'm very aware that there's some of you out there who are blind
4363000	4365000	or have sight impairments and so forth.
4365000	4368000	And so when I say that we're moving to a video-based platform,
4368000	4369000	you might get a little nervous.
4369000	4374000	But I want to try to ease your fears a little bit saying that the way we produce
4374000	4377000	and what we're talking about with this show, that's not going to change.
4377000	4380000	The way we put together OLR and all that, that's not going to change.
4380000	4382000	It's just like our chat room will be a Twitch chat room.
4382000	4386000	And instead of using TuneIn to listen to Orange Launch Radio,
4386000	4390000	you will use the Twitch app, which is available on your phone,
4390000	4392000	available on your PlayStation, your Xbox.
4392000	4394000	It's available a lot of places.
4394000	4397000	So that's another reason why Twitch is pretty appealing.
4397000	4400000	So I hope you will at least give it a shot.
4400000	4403000	I don't have a date for that when that's all going to happen yet.
4403000	4405000	For those of you that don't interact with us live,
4405000	4408000	you only download the podcast every week and check it out.
4408000	4411000	I really don't think for you anything's going to change at all.
4411000	4415000	I really don't because it's still going to be the same show.
4415000	4417000	It's just that instead of being shoutcast on Sunday night,
4417000	4419000	it's going to be on Twitch Sunday night.
4419000	4420000	That's the only change.
4420000	4424000	But I think with a lot of the discoverability features that Twitch has in,
4424000	4427000	a lot of the features when it comes to,
4427000	4430000	some of you have been generous enough to say,
4430000	4433000	I would love to help you guys pay your bills.
4433000	4437000	I would love to be able to help Jamie buy more games
4437000	4440000	or help fund Loki's project.
4440000	4442000	Obviously I'm being a little bit facetious,
4442000	4444000	but you guys have been kind enough to say,
4444000	4445000	I want to support the show financially.
4445000	4448000	And I've always been very skittish about things like Patreon
4448000	4451000	because I don't want you paying upfront
4451000	4454000	for a service that we then have to deliver on.
4454000	4457000	Because, for example, last week we had to cancel the show due to illness.
4457000	4459000	If you'd paid money for that show,
4459000	4461000	I'm sure most of you would be understanding,
4461000	4463000	but there would be people that would feel a little bit like,
4463000	4465000	I paid for something I didn't get.
4465000	4468000	But the nice thing about the Twitch and the subscriptions
4468000	4472000	and the bits and things like that is that you can tip us if you want.
4472000	4473000	You don't have to.
4473000	4475000	If you want, you can do that.
4475000	4477000	I will not be interrupting the show to read bit donate.
4477000	4479000	We have an idea on how we're going to do that.
4479000	4481000	We will acknowledge those of you that choose to do that.
4481000	4484000	We're just not going to do it the way other Twitch streamers have done it.
4484000	4486000	And I'll leave it at that.
4486000	4488000	Or I should say traditionally do it.
4488000	4490000	We'll leave it at that.
4490000	4492000	But it's because, again, the radio show has not changed.
4492000	4494000	It's not going to stop every five seconds to say,
4494000	4496000	oh, thanks for the bits.
4496000	4498000	Act F to appreciate it.
4498000	4501000	I'll still read chat comments because we've always done that.
4501000	4503000	But I just won't stop to read those types of things.
4503000	4508000	But also the subscriptions will hopefully allow us to give you something new
4508000	4510000	that you haven't been able to get before.
4510000	4513000	Again, I want to stress you're not going to have to pay
4513000	4518000	for OLR's audio podcast feed that you've always gotten for free.
4518000	4519000	That's not going to change.
4519000	4521000	You guys know I'm not going to do that to you.
4521000	4524000	But it will allow us to offer something additional to subscribers.
4524000	4529000	And if you use your deductive thinking to think about what is going to be different
4529000	4534000	on Twitch versus Shoutcast, you can probably piece together what might be extra.
4534000	4536000	I'm not wearing any pants.
4536000	4539000	You'd probably be correct on what you're going to get.
4539000	4541000	But I'll leave it at that because, officially,
4541000	4543000	we haven't worked all that out yet, officially.
4543000	4548000	Anyway, I've been turning away from chat because I haven't been totally paying attention.
4548000	4551000	I want to read some of the comments here at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
4551000	4554000	bonds006 says, I listened to the music stream.
4554000	4557000	Not as much now, but I used it a lot in the past.
4557000	4558000	I respect that.
4558000	4561000	And I'm sorry that we are having to sunset that.
4561000	4565000	I will point out the radio costs us a lot.
4565000	4568000	The music stuff is in a gray area.
4568000	4570000	I'm not sure we should be playing.
4570000	4572000	I'm not sure that music feed should exist.
4572000	4577000	So another part of the reason we're doing this is to get us out of that legal gray area
4577000	4581000	because that will also enable us to do some extra things that we've wanted to do.
4581000	4584000	And I hope you guys will understand.
4584000	4586000	Let's see.
4586000	4588000	Other comments in chat at live.vognetwork.com.
4588000	4592000	rageator in chat says, FYI, although I can't tip very often because poor,
4592000	4595000	I tip people from time to time on Twitch and I can get bits easily due to watching ads.
4595000	4596000	Yeah, exactly.
4596000	4598000	Again, this isn't about money.
4598000	4599000	This is not about money.
4599000	4600000	It's not about money.
4600000	4601000	It's not about money.
4601000	4605000	Because if we haven't made money in 16 years and we're still doing it.
4605000	4607000	It's not like we've started a Kickstarter or anything.
4607000	4608000	Exactly.
4608000	4609000	We can't do this show.
4609000	4610000	Here's the thing.
4610000	4611000	So here's the thing.
4611000	4614000	If you want to watch ads and tip us biddies, that is so awesome.
4614000	4616000	I'm so thankful and cool.
4616000	4619000	But you know what you can do on Twitch for free?
4619000	4624000	Hosts, making clips and sharing those clips on social media.
4624000	4630000	And all of that will be worth just as much as biddies, if not more, honestly.
4630000	4635000	So please don't feel any type of financial obligation to this show.
4635000	4640000	Puba in chat says, centralized feed, chat and financial support.
4640000	4642000	And all in all, a bigger platform for exposure.
4642000	4644000	This is a no brainer.
4644000	4645000	So happy for you all.
4645000	4646000	Thank you, Puba.
4646000	4650000	That's definitely in the right direction as to why we're making this change in the first place.
4650000	4652000	Let's see.
4652000	4656000	Also trying to get some of the other comments here in chat at live.vognetwork.com.
4656000	4661000	Tiger Conchet says, I'm using a service called Restream which allows me to broadcast on multiple platforms all at once.
4661000	4664000	So I'd have a stream on Twitch, Mixer, YouTube, Gaming, even Periscope.
4664000	4667000	The plan is to go to Twitch affiliate status with VOG Network.
4667000	4671000	And so the affiliate contract would not allow that.
4671000	4674000	We could put clips on YouTube and things like that.
4674000	4679000	I am going to, I think it's safe for me to tell you, that is not in our plan.
4679000	4683000	We will not be putting today, it's not in our plan today.
4683000	4685000	I'm a never say never type of person.
4685000	4691000	But we may do delayed clips on those services in the future, but that's not the plan.
4691000	4694000	The plan is to go all in on Twitch.
4694000	4696000	For now.
4696000	4699000	And if that doesn't prove to be the right thing to do, then we might change it later.
4699000	4703000	But again, the Twitch affiliate agreements wouldn't allow us to use the restreaming thing.
4703000	4706000	It's only going to be on Twitch.
4706000	4708000	Let's see, one other thing, let's see.
4708000	4713000	TigerClawnChat says on Twitch you can do reruns, so if you did a live show you can have Twitch rebroadcast it since those are archived.
4713000	4716000	You're right, we could.
4716000	4718000	So, anyway.
4718000	4720000	Alright, thank you guys for your flexibility.
4720000	4722000	I will give you a date on that.
4722000	4726000	We're targeting by the end of the year, but as Loki hinted there, we have to make a lot of changes to studio.
4726000	4732000	We have to buy some new equipment, which my husband is currently unemployed, so that's a bit of a challenge.
4732000	4736000	But we are looking at hopefully in the next couple months we'll be there.
4736000	4739000	So the goal is by the end of the year.
4739000	4743000	So stay tuned to all the latest updates.
4743000	4746000	We'll be updating folks in our Discord as well as social media.
4746000	4750000	Again, because I can't stress this enough and I don't want people to freak out over change,
4750000	4756000	if you're listening to this on your podcast in your car on the way to work because you download this show on Monday morning,
4756000	4759000	I really don't think anything is going to change for you.
4759000	4762000	We're still going to just put out the show as we always have,
4762000	4768000	as we did when we were broadcasting on Justin TV for a short while that most of you probably forgot or didn't know about.
4768000	4774000	It's just that we're kind of going back to that a little bit, but this time it's all in on that.
4774000	4776000	Anyway, there you go.
4776000	4780000	Dungeonbuster in chat says, small steps forward, progress will come.
4780000	4782000	Yes, I agree. That is a good note to end on.
4782000	4784000	Alright, let's move on from there.
4784000	4786000	Enough meta stuff about us.
4787000	4790000	We're only like an hour and 20 minutes into the show and we've only talked about that in Nintendo Direct.
4790000	4792000	But there's other stuff going on, right, Loki?
4792000	4797000	Yes, there is. In fact, Nintendo Direct in Japan was a little bit different as well.
4797000	4802000	In fact, one game that's going to be coming to Nintendo Switch in Japan is Assassin's Creed Odyssey.
4802000	4806000	What? You may say, how can that possibly run on a Switch?
4806000	4809000	Well, it's going to be a cloud version of the game.
4809000	4817000	So basically what's going to happen is you're going to be able to stream it to the game console using, I guess, their cloud service.
4817000	4826000	And so that way you'll be able to get the same visuals that you would see elsewhere, but, you know, on a less powerful platform.
4826000	4833000	They're partnering with, I guess, a Taiwanese game streaming company called Ubitis Game Cloud.
4833000	4839000	It's going to cost players $20 to rent the game and stream it for 180 days.
4839000	4843000	And all you have to do is download the 45 megabyte client.
4843000	4847000	So, interesting that they're doing that.
4847000	4849000	Interesting that they didn't announce it here.
4849000	4851000	Is this something about Japan's internet structure versus ours?
4851000	4853000	I think theirs is better than ours.
4853000	4857000	Well, I wouldn't doubt that for a minute, but it's kind of interesting that they're focusing on Japan with that.
4857000	4860000	I think it's a really clever, cool little workaround.
4860000	4868000	Honestly, I know this isn't the popular concept, but gaming's kind of going this direction.
4868000	4875000	Future consoles, we've already heard rumblings that Microsoft may put out.
4875000	4883000	We don't know for sure, but Microsoft, in addition to whatever Xbox 2 Y console they're going to do in the future,
4884000	4892000	they may put out a very bare bones, there's been a lot of rumors about a bare bones streaming device that only does the streaming type of stuff.
4892000	4894000	And playing games in the cloud and all that.
4894000	4898000	And that's, you guys, it's 2018 and the Phantom is finally here.
4898000	4901000	The Phantom console, finally. Finally.
4901000	4903000	It's just so ahead of its time.
4903000	4905000	It's just ahead of its time.
4905000	4909000	Well, we laugh, but where's the lie?
4909000	4913000	Do you think that this is where games are? We're going to be playing games in the cloud.
4913000	4918000	I mean, sure, there's latency issues and things like that today, but internet's only going to get better, Loki.
4921000	4927000	Well, at least I hope my internet gets better by Tuesday when the tech comes so I can get back to live streaming, but anyway.
4927000	4937000	Yeah, I mean, what I would see with the new Xbox console is it not necessarily going to be something that is its own standalone streaming thing.
4937000	4943000	I could see them integrating it into TVs like you would see with the Roku device, like my TV has a built in Roku device.
4943000	4945000	And you can just stream it with that.
4945000	4954000	Or it could be an app that works with those devices so that you can stream through that and then you just sync your Bluetooth, Xbox One controller and away you go.
4954000	4956000	So I could see something like that.
4956000	4961000	Be interested in seeing how popular this is. I'm kind of curious to see how it works out.
4961000	4964000	It looked cool based on the demo and stuff.
4964000	4975000	So be interested to see what other games could come to the platform. And that might be an option for, you know, like Battlefield and Call of Duty and stuff like that.
4975000	4985000	Going to chat at live.voguenetwork.com, YYR says, get that streaming crap out of my video games. As someone who mostly plays arcade style fast paced games, I don't ever want to stream them.
4985000	4990000	Okay, sure. No, I get that. And like you can't stream music based games or any of that stuff. Like I totally get that.
4990000	5002000	But at the same time, what if the internet and all this cloud technology, what if the latency gets just as good on that as it does from the wireless controller to your television is today?
5002000	5008000	Because at the rate the technology is multiplying, I'm just saying, like, you know, we're not there yet. So it's tough to visualize.
5008000	5016000	But I imagine what in 10 years, the latency between your wireless controller and your TV is going to be just as fast as latency on your internet.
5016000	5026000	And so some of these issues will get better, I think, you know, but then again, you know, as I'm experiencing firsthand this week, a lot of that falls in the hands of somebody else.
5026000	5038000	And when that fails, it can be very frustrating. So I also can understand why people may not want to go all in on the cloud because maybe their internet is not going to be that reliable. So I get that.
5038000	5042000	And they're doing all they can right now to fight making it any better.
5042000	5049000	Yeah. And YYR does point out there's a lot of folks in rural communities who are stuck with crappy internet. So that's true.
5049000	5053000	So maybe this, you know, cloud streaming thing won't be for everybody. I just kind of feel like, I don't know.
5053000	5055000	It's a neat experiment. Let's see if it works.
5055000	5065000	Yeah. Even in rural areas, they have satellite. And yes, that's very expensive. But you know what? Mobile phones were really expensive for every minute when they first came out.
5065000	5079000	And you know, now everybody, like everybody has an iPhone or an Android in their pocket, almost there. I shouldn't say everybody, but you know, you're not paying for that technology, which you used to in the mid 90s, which for all intents and purposes was not that long ago.
5079000	5086000	That's kind of that's kind of where I'm going with this is that technology is going so fast. And it's hard to visualize where it's going to be in 10 years.
5086000	5097000	But like, if you consider the ground we've made in the next 20 years, I don't think it's unreasonable to think that even people in rural communities will get fast internet out of thin air in 20 years.
5097000	5105000	Because look at where we've come from 20 years ago to today. I guess. I guess that's my point.
5106000	5117000	Bobby Blackwell points out, excuse me, the budget phone X phone iPhone XR is $750. Well, that's why people are paying the monthly fees at this point to lease them like they're their cars or something like that.
5117000	5129000	But at the same time, get an I'm sure many people would say get an Android and that's fine. I don't like the whole anti iPhone or anti Android stuff. I think both having both is good.
5129000	5136000	Get a comparable Android device then if you want. I just iPhone 7 is going to be cheaper and cheaper.
5136000	5144000	Or I just like what am I really getting for that premium price? And that's not just Apple. That's just like any phone.
5144000	5153000	I mean, I love my iPhone 10. I really do. I'm not going to buy one of these new phones. It's not enough of an upgrade from what I already have to pay that price.
5153000	5160000	If I was still rocking my iPhone 6 Plus, then maybe I would, you know, which I was last year when I bought the 10, then maybe I would look into that.
5160000	5165000	But anyway, this is this is not the mobile phone podcast. We have plenty of other gaming stuff to get into.
5165000	5170000	But so would you would you be open to playing more games through streaming Loki?
5170000	5178000	No, because I've tried that even locally through my network to just play games streaming from my PlayStation 4.
5178000	5186000	Although I haven't tried it with the pro, so I'm not sure if that works any better now, but it has not been a satisfactory experience.
5186000	5195000	And so I will not be doing that in the future. Yeah. Although I may try it now with the pro that I think of it because my wife doesn't really watch Netflix all the time.
5195000	5205000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase PEAK.
5205000	5209000	Well, let me move on to a different type of streaming. So I've talked a lot about Twitch, Twitch, Twitch.
5209000	5214000	But of course, Mixer is a player out there and, you know, Mixer's continuing to do their stuff through Microsoft.
5214000	5224000	And this is something pretty cool that sets Mixer apart, is that you are getting now in-game bonuses for Mixer streams for Forza Horizon 4.
5224000	5234000	No, the game isn't out yet, but the demo is. And so if you stream the demo online, the streamer and the viewer actually get in-game rewards from this.
5234000	5240000	Influence is kind of the scoring, the currency sort of in Forza Horizon.
5240000	5243000	You know, as you do tricks, you get more influence, you get fans and stuff like that.
5243000	5249000	Yeah. One way you can get influence is broadcasting and watching broadcast through Mixer. That's pretty cool.
5249000	5256000	Now, we have seen, I mean, it isn't brand new to have games influenced by live streams on Twitch and Mixer and other platforms.
5256000	5263000	But, you know, Forza Horizon 4 is a pretty big title, a pretty, you know, big like first party game to get something like this.
5263000	5269000	And I think it's really cool. So anyway, as long, everything has to be linked to your Xbox gamer tag.
5269000	5276000	And you get influence points every five minutes that you watch a feed. If you're streaming it, you get every two minutes.
5276000	5280000	The game itself, again, is out on September 28th. It will continue this.
5280000	5284000	But the demo that's going on right now is giving you some of like the pre-rewards with this.
5284000	5290000	So, you know, giving more reason to stream and kind of participate together. I think that's really cool.
5290000	5297000	Something that Forza is also doing, Forza Horizon 4, would be James Bond DLC.
5297000	5304000	That's right. There's going to be a Forza Horizon 4 pack that will bring ten of Bond's iconic cars to the game.
5304000	5310000	We don't know the exact cars yet, but we do know the best of Bond pack is going to be available when the game comes out.
5310000	5314000	So assuming there will be an Aston Martin and all this stuff.
5314000	5317000	Oh no, we do know the list. We don't know the price. So we do know some of them.
5317000	5324000	So we know, of course, Aston Martin, the 1964 DB5 and the 2015 DB10 will be there.
5324000	5327000	The BMW Z8 from The World Is Not Enough will be there as well.
5327000	5332000	So some of the iconic Bond cars will be there. We just don't know the exact price yet.
5332000	5337000	So, pretty cool. Yeah, I'm super hyped for Forza Horizon 4.
5337000	5341000	As if I didn't have enough to play right now, but here it is. September's here.
5341000	5347000	And now the ramp up to the end of the year begins where there's going to be stuff like every single week that's going to be something you want to play.
5347000	5348000	So, anyway.
5348000	5352000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, RageNator in chat says,
5352000	5358000	I hear that Mixer has been having major growing pains and stability issues to the point where streams have been totally unwatchable.
5358000	5366000	I haven't heard that, but I haven't used Mixer a lot. I did randomly watch it on my Xbox One the other night.
5366000	5369000	I was watching some of the stuff that Microsoft kind of puts together themselves.
5369000	5373000	They were actually doing a program about World of Warcraft, which I thought was interesting.
5373000	5376000	So, I mean, it's not like they're going to cover PlayStation games,
5376000	5380000	but I don't think they're going to ignore that, you know, Nintendo is out there,
5380000	5383000	especially when they've got these Minecraft play together things going on.
5383000	5388000	And, you know, PC. I mean, Microsoft still has a lot to win in the PC space.
5388000	5393000	So, it doesn't surprise me that they're talking about World of Warcraft for Windows, right?
5393000	5397000	So, all right. Anyway, moving on. Loki.
5397000	5406000	All right. Well, speaking of Microsoft, one of their properties, Alan Wake, is, I guess, expected to become a TV show.
5408000	5409000	So, that's different.
5409000	5413000	I haven't actually played Alan Wake. I know a little bit about it,
5413000	5418000	but neat to see that it's actually being turned into that.
5418000	5426000	So, I guess I'm going to continue off where the story, I guess, ended
5426000	5432000	and take place along with the inhabitants of Bright Falls.
5432000	5436000	They said the story of the original game is our starting point,
5436000	5441000	the seed of which we will expand our bigger story that we're exploring in the show.
5441000	5444000	We'll be expanding the lore of this crazy dark universe
5444000	5449000	and diving deeper into certain aspects of it than the game ever did.
5449000	5455000	Not only that, but through the years, we've worked on multiple game concepts
5455000	5459000	and stories for Alan Wake's world that have never seen the light of day.
5459000	5464000	All of this material will function as the potential source material for the show.
5465000	5466000	Neat.
5466000	5471000	Yeah, it seems a little late, seeing as this game was a little while ago.
5471000	5475000	I don't know if maybe there'll be a new Alan Wake game or something to kind of go with it.
5475000	5481000	But, I mean, I felt like I was playing a TV show when I played the game.
5481000	5485000	I think it is a game a lot of people slept on that's really good.
5485000	5486000	It was an episodic game.
5486000	5491000	It was very Twin Peaks-ish, and it even had its whole show-within-a-show type of thing that was going on.
5491000	5495000	I really would check this out. Why not? I think it would be very cool.
5497000	5499000	Alright, will you watch the Alan Wake TV show?
5499000	5502000	Probably not, just because I've never played the game.
5502000	5503000	I mean, I don't know.
5503000	5505000	You don't need to see the game to watch the show.
5505000	5506000	Maybe. I don't know.
5506000	5507000	Alright. Anyway.
5509000	5513000	Also, talking about streaming with Twitch and Microsoft.
5513000	5517000	Finally, a redesigned Twitch app for the Xbox One is on the way.
5517000	5523000	Some people were wondering were they going to bother because Microsoft is obviously going in on Mixer quite a bit.
5523000	5527000	But, nope, the answer is there are still people that are using Twitch on their Xbox One.
5527000	5530000	Hello, I'm one of them, actually. I use Twitch a lot on my Xbox One.
5530000	5534000	So I'm happy that they're finally updating with the PlayStation 4 version.
5534000	5537000	Right now, it's only part of the Insiders test group.
5537000	5541000	So you do have to be in the Insiders test group, which I think I'm in, but I don't have this.
5541000	5543000	I think I haven't opted into it yet.
5543000	5547000	I think you have to launch the whole actual, like, Insider app and then enable it.
5547000	5549000	So, maybe that's what I need to do.
5549000	5555000	But, some of the things that will be in this will be live video previews so that you can see the live streams while you browse.
5555000	5558000	Which, the desktop version of this does this automatically.
5558000	5559000	Sometimes annoyingly so.
5559000	5565000	Like, right when you go to the Twitch front page, you get somebody's stream and let's just hope they're not screaming.
5565000	5569000	You can also see chat on offline videos, which is really cool.
5569000	5576000	Especially since, you know, maybe this pre-recorded stream thing is something I'm going to have to do for a little bit until these upload issues get fixed.
5576000	5579000	So, the fact that you can do the chat after the fact is pretty cool.
5579000	5583000	And, yeah, just do some improved stability and some additions there on the Twitch app.
5583000	5588000	So it's going to kind of bring it up to parity with the PlayStation 4 version, to which I say good.
5588000	5593000	And I hope they're also future-proofing it by putting the tag system into it and some of that stuff.
5593000	5597000	Because the communities are not in the Xbox One version right now.
5597000	5599000	And I don't think it's in the PlayStation 4 version either.
5599000	5603000	And that kind of bothers me because I do like to look in community tags a lot.
5603000	5607000	Like Small Streamer, Twitch, Unity, those types of tags.
5607000	5609000	I like to look in those a lot to try to find new people.
5609000	5611000	And you can't do that on the consoles today.
5611000	5616000	So I do hope, you know, we know that those are going away in favor of the tagging system, which is going to be similar.
5616000	5621000	I really hope that the apps will have the tagging stuff built into it.
5621000	5623000	That would make me very happy.
5623000	5626000	Anyhow, a few more stories before we get into the Classic Game of the Week.
5626000	5627000	Loki.
5627000	5629000	One game I forgot to mention that I did play this week, Pokémon GO.
5629000	5631000	I'm playing quite a bit of that.
5631000	5638000	But you could be playing even more of that in some of these regions throughout the world.
5638000	5646000	Brazil and Korea, they have opened up the ability for players to nominate new Pokéstops in those regions.
5646000	5650000	I'm guessing because there isn't a lot of them there.
5651000	5662000	But apparently they said for level 40 trainers in Brazil and Korea, you'll be able to submit different locations and objects through the app settings menu.
5662000	5668000	To actually pin locations that could possibly become Pokéstops in the future.
5668000	5673000	And eventually they will open it up wider as they roll it out.
5674000	5681000	I'm assuming kind of like they did with Ingress where it will be available for lower level trainers.
5681000	5684000	And then for more regions I'm assuming.
5684000	5687000	So this is kind of just a little bit of a test bench.
5687000	5697000	And then right now they're saying, of course we've seen different sponsored Pokéstops, Sprint and Starbucks.
5697000	5702000	But they're hoping that according to the CEO.
5702000	5707000	Fostering these moments of discovery and exploration is the foundation of what we do.
5707000	5717000	The world is a big place and the only way we can find the very best locations for inclusion in our game is with the help of its players.
5719000	5723000	So you ready for me to say something that not everybody is going to like?
5723000	5727000	As an Ingress player I'm not really a big fan of this at all.
5728000	5731000	Here's the thing, before you come at me with your pitchfork and torches.
5731000	5736000	I realize that a lot of rural players, and I'm not trying to be elitist.
5736000	5738000	So please let me explain myself here.
5738000	5742000	Because you know I hate that elitism and stuff so let me explain why.
5742000	5745000	Ingress is a very player versus player game.
5745000	5747000	It is extremely player versus player.
5747000	5752000	To the point where people on the other team, I don't really interact with an awful lot.
5752000	5756000	Because if they know where I am, they know the targets I can hit.
5756000	5760000	And it's the same thing with them because that is how PvP that game is.
5760000	5767000	Those of you playing Pokémon GO, Mystic versus Valor versus Instinct for all the shit talking that goes on amongst those teams.
5767000	5768000	That is not PvP.
5768000	5770000	In fact it's quite the opposite.
5770000	5775000	You need people of the other team to help you out, to knock you out of gyms if you want your 50 coins.
5775000	5779000	Like if the people are not there to fight you, you're not going to get your own rewards.
5779000	5782000	So this is the reason why.
5782000	5791000	I am completely fine with new Pokéstops being added into Pokémon GO and only Pokémon GO from the Pokémon GO players.
5791000	5795000	I do not want to see those Pokéstops become Ingress portals.
5795000	5802000	Because since you know, and keep in mind I'm not just a level 16 Ingress player which is the max.
5802000	5807000	I'm a level 39 which is one level below max Pokémon GO player.
5807000	5812000	If somebody puts a Pokéstop on their house, I mean it doesn't really hurt anything.
5812000	5815000	That's fine, it's a Pokéstop, whatever.
5815000	5817000	I mean some might say game balance blah blah blah.
5817000	5821000	Whatever, it's not as big of a deal as a portal in Ingress going on your house.
5821000	5825000	And now people are going to be like attacking, trying to field from it.
5825000	5831000	And they're doing strategic things where it's like I'm going to manipulate the fuck out of this portal because I live on top of it and I don't even have to like travel at all.
5831000	5834000	Because that is already a problem in some regards today.
5834000	5840000	And that problem is only going to get worse if we get shitty Pokéstop submissions in Ingress.
5840000	5841000	You know what I mean?
5841000	5843000	So again, and I want to make myself very clear.
5843000	5849000	I am fine if Pokémon GO players create Pokéstops that are only in Pokémon GO.
5849000	5860000	But since they're having the Ingress OPR system review these, I'm a little nervous that they're going to cross over into Ingress at some point.
5860000	5863000	Now, the way it is now, I'm still okay with it. Why?
5863000	5872000	Because the Ingress players who understand the PvP, who are not going to allow these portals to go into places where they're going to have portal battles and so forth going on.
5872000	5875000	They're going to continue to not allow that stuff.
5875000	5877000	And so hopefully that will fix some of the real problem.
5877000	5886000	But if they allow Pokémon players to start doing the review and those things go into Ingress, Ingress is going to be ruined.
5886000	5889000	Mark my words.
5890000	5894000	So maybe I'm just being that old codger that fears change.
5894000	5896000	Ingress 2.0.
5896000	5898000	Yeah, but it's still the same game.
5898000	5900000	So anyway, that's just my take on that.
5900000	5902000	And I'm sure you know what?
5902000	5905000	Many of you don't give a shit about Ingress.
5905000	5906000	That's cool.
5906000	5908000	But please recognize that I do.
5908000	5910000	And I made friends through the game.
5910000	5913000	And so yes, I really do not want to see my game get screwed up.
5913000	5916000	And we also, right now we don't know how the Harry Potter game is going to play.
5916000	5917000	No, we don't.
5917000	5919000	Because if that's very PvP.
5919000	5920000	Yeah, it very well could be.
5920000	5923000	Then you're going to regret some of these decisions and stops.
5923000	5925000	Yeah, you really are.
5925000	5926000	So anyway.
5926000	5929000	We'll play, I bet, four way PvP too with that game.
5929000	5933000	I do think though, the way they've implemented it now,
5933000	5935000	OPR is already so backlogged.
5935000	5938000	I can access Ingress OPR and I can review portals and stuff.
5938000	5940000	And I have.
5940000	5943000	Actually I think I have 960 agreements last I checked.
5943000	5945000	So I've reviewed a lot of portals.
5945000	5947000	I've seen some of the bullshit people submit.
5947000	5948000	I've seen toilets.
5948000	5949000	I've seen cats.
5949000	5955000	I've seen the picture of somebody's hand saying I'm just testing this to see if it works.
5955000	5957000	I've seen all the bullshit in there.
5957000	5961000	And I've seen some really rad stuff too.
5961000	5965000	And I've seen stuff in the middle of fucking nowhere that's pretty awesome.
5965000	5968000	I've seen trail markers on places I probably would never go.
5968000	5971000	And sign boards that explain a vista point in places I'll probably.
5971000	5973000	You know, that's all rad.
5973000	5976000	And that's the type of stuff I hope to continue to see and all that stuff and so forth.
5976000	5977000	But anyway.
5977000	5979000	Where was I going with all this?
5979000	5981000	Where was the old man going?
5981000	5982000	Don't fuck up our shit.
5982000	5987000	No, it's that they don't really give a lot of incentive for Ingress players to review in OPR.
5987000	5991000	And so I feel like this is just going to backlog an already backlogged system.
5991000	5993000	Can't get a bad Joe.
5993000	5998000	Niantic just needs to probably hire some people to do some of the reviews internally.
5998000	6004000	And on top of that, I've submitted nice photos for those Pokestops and the Ingress locations.
6004000	6007000	Especially when we have old ass photos on there.
6007000	6010000	And sometimes they get voted up and they're used.
6010000	6015000	But sometimes it doesn't seem like they use the new photos to help them.
6015000	6018000	Let me get to some comments in our chat at live.vognetwork.com.
6018000	6022000	Captain Spike from the wonderful Game Buoy podcast says, Gamebuoy.org says,
6022000	6026000	I don't know though, isn't this mostly about other regions where the community is currently not being served?
6026000	6033000	It feels like this opens the game up to communities that maybe currently aren't able to participate due to their locations.
6033000	6038000	I realize Ingress isn't as popular. It's available in all these same areas.
6038000	6043000	But sure, some of these rural places are probably not as well accounted for.
6043000	6046000	But the system is this way now.
6046000	6050000	But you guys don't think it's going to roll out beyond...
6050000	6053000	It's going to be worldwide at some point. It really is.
6053000	6058000	So maybe they'll geofence it so that it's really only rural places.
6058000	6063000	I don't know, but I'm just kind of worried that it's going to get unleashed on everybody.
6063000	6067000	What it is for now is a test, but that's kind of what it is.
6067000	6071000	So they're only allowed to submit in those locations?
6071000	6074000	They're only allowed to submit in Brazil and South Korea right now.
6074000	6078000	Limiting it to players in those locations because I can see someone, oh hey, I'm a player.
6078000	6084000	Remember how when the brand new nearby system rolled out, you only saw it in San Francisco in the beginning?
6084000	6085000	Yes.
6085000	6088000	Because it's like that. It was geofenced in that cell.
6088000	6091000	The Charlie 2, which are...
6091000	6093000	See, I'm relating it to Ingress.
6093000	6099000	So that geofence was the exact same fence because Davis was included in some of those places.
6099000	6102000	It was the exact same fence that makes up the Charlie 2 cell in Ingress.
6102000	6106000	That was the location you could see the nearby stuff in Pokémon GO.
6106000	6108000	Anyway, cool story.
6108000	6114000	Let's see, and Bobby Blackwell says, wasn't it Russia that just got Pokémon GO released this week?
6114000	6117000	Yes, that is true. They just got Pokémon GO finally this week.
6117000	6124000	So anyway, I'm sure not everybody's going to agree with my thoughts, but please try to consider this other game that I have invested a lot of time into.
6124000	6129000	Again, this is all I'm saying. I do not want the Pokémon GO stuff to go back into Ingress.
6129000	6130000	That is it.
6131000	6134000	If the Pokémon GO community wants to add every...
6134000	6139000	Every rock is a Pokéstop and everything, everywhere, every mailbox is a Pokéstop, fine.
6139000	6140000	Go for it.
6140000	6142000	But keep it in that game.
6142000	6146000	Do not bring it to the PvP game that is Ingress.
6146000	6149000	That's what I'm saying to make that very, very, very clear.
6149000	6150000	All right.
6150000	6157000	CaptainSpike says, gameboi.org, but I appreciate your concerns and I'm sure balance issues will arise for a time.
6157000	6164000	But to me, this seems like growth that overall should be healthy for all of their IP based software as having more players keep them going.
6164000	6168000	As long as the submissions are legitimate, yes.
6168000	6179000	But let me tell you the frustration of somebody's fucking tree in their grandma's house front yard being a portal in Ingress.
6179000	6181000	Or a fake horse.
6181000	6185000	It is something that holds down all of these different...
6185000	6189000	Because one team knows that's their grandma's house and that's...
6189000	6193000	They can control that as much as they want and it fucks up the balance of the game.
6193000	6197000	Like that is a perspective that is very hard for me to explain to a Pokémon GO player.
6197000	6202000	That is how the balance of the game can be very fucked up if anything and everything becomes a Pokéstop.
6202000	6206000	Absolutely I want more rural players to have all their Pokéstops.
6206000	6207000	I really do.
6207000	6208000	And I want rural players to have Ingress portals.
6208000	6209000	I do.
6209000	6212000	I want them to be legitimate.
6212000	6215000	Every park should be littered with this shit.
6215000	6217000	I'm so for that.
6217000	6219000	Historical sites. Public access.
6219000	6221000	Yes, I'm all for that stuff.
6221000	6225000	Residential property. Fuck. No.
6225000	6227000	That's my concern.
6227000	6229000	Hopefully that makes sense.
6229000	6232000	I have a pretty particular looking tree, perhaps.
6232000	6234000	All you have to do is put googly eyes on it, Loki.
6234000	6235000	I'm going to.
6235000	6239000	It only took us like three fucking years to get that portal removed in Ingress.
6239000	6246000	That story, that was a true fucking story that I just explained.
6246000	6250000	Anyway, let's move on.
6250000	6255000	I got one more story for you guys and it has to do with breaking the law, breaking the law.
6255000	6257000	EA is breaking the law.
6257000	6259000	No, legit, they are legit.
6259000	6260000	Yeah, I know.
6260000	6262000	In Belgium, here's the deal.
6262000	6267000	We know the Belgian government, because we heard about this with Overwatch, because they had to change the system and so forth.
6267000	6270000	Belgium declared loot boxes to be a form of gambling.
6270000	6276000	Well, EA has come out with FIFA 19, just came out recently and just basically said,
6276000	6278000	we are not going to change the pack.
6278000	6283000	EA did not modify FIFA's randomized card pack loot boxes.
6283000	6289000	EA says that the games were developed and implemented ethically and lawfully around the world.
6289000	6292000	They do not agree that the games are considered as any form of gambling.
6292000	6293000	Basically...
6293000	6300000	We're making too much fucking money from this and your little pitiful fines are going to stop us from making all of the money.
6300000	6307000	EA is doing something that I feel, in my opinion, the president does on Twitter all the time.
6307000	6311000	If I say something enough, it'll be true.
6311000	6313000	So that's what's happening, right?
6313000	6318000	EA is saying, it's not gambling.
6318000	6319000	It's not gambling.
6319000	6320000	That's their defense.
6320000	6322000	If EA says it enough, maybe it'll be true.
6322000	6324000	Just like, it's not collusion, it's not collusion.
6324000	6325000	Right?
6325000	6326000	It's a similar thing.
6326000	6328000	If I say it enough, maybe it'll be true.
6328000	6331000	I'm going to get hate mail for that one, but deal with it.
6331000	6338000	But the reality is, at the end of the day, you are selling a product in this country,
6338000	6345000	and if you're not following the country's rules, they're going to pursue and kick you out, basically, of being able to sell games in the country,
6345000	6347000	possibly fine you because you've been making money off the citizens.
6347000	6349000	I hope they fine them a lot.
6349000	6356000	Well, what's happening is that the Belgian government has launched, according to reports,
6356000	6361000	has launched a criminal investigation into EA because they have not modified the system.
6361000	6364000	This is according to the Metro publication.
6364000	6366000	It's a publication in Belgium.
6366000	6371000	They are being subject to a criminal investigation by the Brussels Public Prosecutor's Office.
6371000	6374000	The case will go to court if they choose to prosecute.
6374000	6382000	Finland is also looking into these loot boxes as well, so more countries will hopefully jump on board.
6382000	6383000	It's terrible.
6383000	6389000	Seriously, I don't play a lot of these sports games that these are still in because they're not taking them out of the sports games.
6389000	6394000	They may take them out of Star Wars and out of Battlefield and stuff like that,
6394000	6401000	but you've got to understand that this Ultimate Team shit, they're making bank off of this shit.
6401000	6404000	They're making so much bank that they're not going to fucking compromise that.
6404000	6410000	When my Xbox account got stolen on my Xbox 360, and it was like 10 years ago and I still haven't gotten over it,
6410000	6414000	the thief used my card to buy a bunch of FIFA shit.
6414000	6419000	This stuff is huge around the world, even if it's not as big in the US, so it's a little harder to picture.
6419000	6424000	I know some people are into it, certainly here in the US, but it's not Fortnite.
6424000	6428000	But in other countries, FIFA is the game.
6428000	6434000	But NBA 2K19, for example, totally different company, same shit.
6434000	6440000	The game is just so pay-to-win, even.
6441000	6447000	You buy the collector's edition, you get 100,000 of it's even called virtual currency
6447000	6452000	because they couldn't think of an intelligent name for it, virtual currency.
6452000	6458000	You get 100,000 of it to help build your stats of your character in the game to be a better player.
6458000	6460000	Otherwise, you've got to grind through the game.
6460000	6465000	And they're like, oh, it's player choice. This way, you don't have to grind as hard and stuff.
6465000	6470000	But the problem is, you built the fucking grind into the game in the first place.
6470000	6478000	You're not helping people, you're creating the problem and then also creating the solution for the problem that costs money.
6478000	6483000	But people will pay it because, I don't know.
6483000	6486000	It's the same reason why people will pay $1200 for a phone.
6486000	6493000	Well, you can imagine social media has lit up about this and pretty much most of what people are saying about EA.
6493000	6499000	They're basically saying to Belgium, they're saying, yes, drag her, expose her, arrest her.
6499000	6503000	That's basically what social media is saying to EA.
6503000	6506000	Drag them, get them.
6506000	6510000	Because I think most people have just had it with loot box shit.
6510000	6516000	They've just had it with loot box shit and they want to see EA have to answer for it.
6516000	6521000	If you want to make these games free to play, make FIFA a free to play game that you can just go download for free.
6521000	6528000	Hey FIFA 19, it's a free game, go download it. NBA 2K 19, it's a free game, go download it and they have loot boxes in it.
6528000	6530000	I have no fucking problem with that.
6530000	6538000	I'm just surprised EA had a year to think about how to make these buku bucks instead of the loot boxes and they kind of failed to do it.
6538000	6544000	So now they're just sticking to their guns and I really think EA is going to get kicked out of Belgium for this.
6544000	6546000	I think this is where this ends.
6546000	6548000	EA products will be banned in Belgium.
6548000	6551000	I don't think they'll fucking care because they're probably going to lose.
6551000	6553000	It's just Belgium.
6553000	6555000	They're going to lose less money just like whatever.
6555000	6564000	Sorry. You know what's sad? I know we have listeners in Belgium that listen to this show and I just want to say, even if EA doesn't appreciate you, I appreciate you.
6564000	6568000	Okay? And your chocolate and your waffle and all the stereotypes.
6568000	6571000	It's a calculated risk. They understand what they're making from this.
6571000	6576000	They don't want to give any of that up because it's tons of fucking money for doing essentially nothing.
6576000	6582000	And that's what they're going to do. They're going to play this out because what's the worst that's going to happen?
6582000	6587000	They're going to maybe have to pay a small fine and maybe they can't sell their game.
6587000	6591000	Oh no. The Twitter says they're going to arrest the CEO.
6591000	6592000	They're not going to arrest anything.
6592000	6594000	He's going to rot in Belgium jail.
6594000	6597000	As much as I would love to see that, that's never going to happen.
6597000	6599000	Drag her. Expose her. Say it, Logie.
6599000	6601000	Drag her. Expose her.
6601000	6603000	Drag her. Expose her.
6604000	6611000	As much as it's never going to fucking happen, we can't arrest people over here for like actual crimes and get them to the jail.
6611000	6613000	I mean, it's never going to fucking happen.
6613000	6619000	All right. Anyway, on that note, let's, uh, let's go.
6619000	6625000	Let's go to a time when, you know, video games were for everybody, including people in Belgium.
6625000	6629000	Let's go to the classic game of the week or acid is the classic peripheral of the month.
6629000	6635000	Uh, y'all know we use radio magic to make this happen and, uh, get dark Sakura with us here every week on the show.
6635000	6643000	But I do want to let you know, just due to us being unexpectedly off last week, see, we had calibrated our radio magic to work last week.
6643000	6646000	And, uh, unfortunately due to an error in the space time.
6646000	6652000	You know what? Fuck it. The real story is we recorded it last week, so you have to hear it this week.
6652000	6656000	So if you hear some things that are a little bit out of sync, that's why.
6656000	6658000	That being said, radio magic.
6659000	6664000	So let's take a trip through space and time to visit with dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
6664000	6665000	Oh, hi.
6665000	6666000	Hi. How are you?
6666000	6667000	I'm okay.
6667000	6672000	I feel like it's been a while between, uh, our week off and, uh, you know, the, the mess up a couple of weeks ago.
6672000	6673000	It's been a little while.
6673000	6675000	Yeah, a bit, a bit, a bit.
6675000	6680000	Uh, can you tell us quickly in 15 seconds, what have you been doing in the past three weeks?
6680000	6681000	Playing Wow.
6681000	6683000	Okay. That, that sums it up.
6683000	6685000	Going to work, being sick, playing pinball.
6685000	6686000	We have a theater magic.
6686000	6687000	Oh, congrats on that.
6687000	6692000	And it was the first time I've arranged a pinball purchase myself from ground up.
6692000	6693000	She's a business woman.
6693000	6696000	Dan was very proud of me and it has nothing wrong with it.
6696000	6698000	He's like, I don't know what to do with the machine.
6698000	6699000	I don't have to work on.
6699000	6704000	So, um, it's going to make me broke for the month.
6704000	6706000	Real quick. Cause I know it's going to come up on OLR tonight.
6706000	6707000	I don't even know if you know this yet.
6707000	6709000	Did you hear about the Valley Williams license?
6709000	6713000	Uh, it was announced that the creators of Zen pinball actually have that.
6714000	6719000	So it's going to come to pinball FX three, even though it was in the farsight studios game, the pinball arcade.
6719000	6724000	So it was kind of, kind of surprising that I get, well, I mean it's like surprising, but not surprising.
6724000	6725000	That's cool.
6725000	6729000	Yeah. So I played, they have, what's the, what's the table you can play right now?
6729000	6730000	Cause they just played earlier this week.
6730000	6734000	The fish fishing, something real fish, real fishing, something like that.
6734000	6735000	I don't know.
6735000	6737000	I also played the getaway.
6737000	6740000	I'm just thinking of fish tales, which was an older one.
6740000	6741000	It was like from the nineties.
6741000	6742000	Yeah. We have the getaway.
6742000	6746000	Okay. Yeah. Oh, okay. That's a, you can play that one too. Anyway.
6746000	6749000	No, I mean literally I have that machine, that table.
6749000	6751000	Yeah. I think I remember playing it at your house.
6751000	6754000	So you have to, you have to play the pinball FX one and see how it compares.
6754000	6758000	But anyway, I mean, we've been talking about all sorts of news tonight.
6758000	6760000	We got to get into the classic game of the week.
6760000	6761000	That's what you're here to do is to school us.
6761000	6762000	Not a game.
6762000	6764000	Oh, Oh, what a twist.
6764000	6765000	Oh yeah. We're a little behind.
6765000	6766000	We got to catch up with the peripherals.
6766000	6769000	We're on September now.
6769000	6771000	We did, I did, I did, um, August.
6771000	6772000	Did we do August?
6772000	6776000	Yeah. I think August I did, um, the dance pads.
6776000	6778000	I don't know. I think because of the work snafu,
6778000	6780000	I think this might actually be August thing.
6780000	6783000	I will look up what month we're doing and you can talk about what we're
6783000	6787000	going to talk about. So what is the classic peripheral for the month?
6787000	6788000	What it ever it is.
6788000	6795000	The Sega 3d glasses, which I felt inspired to do wink, wink, wink, wink.
6795000	6796000	Anyway.
6796000	6799000	It might be a suggestion because I knew I was going to talk about VR
6799000	6802000	tonight. Cause I got to play Bobby's at dragon one.
6802000	6806000	So it was a little hint. So this is 1980s, VR.
6806000	6810000	They were also known as a Sega scope, 3d glasses. And in Brazil,
6810000	6813000	they were called Oculus 3d Rob.
6813000	6817000	Oh, Oculus Oculus, Oculus, Oculus rift roped.
6817000	6821000	And in Argentina, they were, I'm going to mispronounce this.
6822000	6823000	3d.
6825000	6826000	Okay.
6827000	6830000	If I remember right, if I, if I remember my Spanish from, from high school,
6830000	6831000	I think.
6834000	6835000	Okay. Okay.
6835000	6838000	But anyway, these were for the Sega master system and they would, uh,
6838000	6842000	create an illusion of 3d graphics in some games.
6842000	6847000	They weren't invented by the guy who did marble madness, Mark Cerny.
6847000	6848000	Um,
6848000	6851000	they use a shutter system to close the left and right lenses rapidly to
6851000	6852000	create a 3d effect.
6852000	6853000	Um,
6853000	6857000	the master system glasses can only be used with the original Sega master
6857000	6861000	system since it hooks up to the card port that does not exist on the master
6861000	6862000	system too.
6862000	6863000	Um,
6864000	6867000	it, uh, allows a 3d graphics in full color,
6867000	6871000	although it halves the frame weight because of the, uh,
6871000	6874000	the shutters and it can also produce a flicker.
6874000	6879000	It also does not work very well with non CRT televisions.
6879000	6880000	Um,
6880000	6886000	they came out first in the UK in October, 1987 for a 39 pound 95.
6886000	6887000	Um,
6887000	6890000	North American release came out later that year.
6890000	6891000	Um,
6891000	6895000	3d glasses were also released in Japan, November, 1987,
6895000	6900000	and they were bundled with Zaxxon 3d and then in Brazil and South Korea in
6900000	6902000	1989.
6902000	6904000	Now keep in mind, I guess for Brazil, you know,
6904000	6907000	cause the master system is still strong in Brazil.
6907000	6908000	It's a thing,
6908000	6912000	but the games that it's compatible with is Blade Eagle,
6912000	6915000	Line of Fire for a master system, of course, Maze Hunter 3d,
6915000	6919000	Missile Defense 3d, Outrun 3d, Poseidon Wars 3d,
6919000	6922000	Space Harrier 3d and Zaxxon 3d.
6922000	6923000	Um,
6924000	6925000	we have a pair.
6925000	6926000	We,
6926000	6928000	I think we now have a TV that it,
6928000	6929000	that it works with.
6929000	6930000	Um,
6930000	6933000	but they're kind of like those big eighties.
6933000	6934000	They look like,
6934000	6937000	like the over glasses that you wear over like prescription glasses,
6937000	6939000	but they're pretty cool.
6939000	6940000	Um,
6940000	6941000	but yeah,
6941000	6942000	that's,
6942000	6943000	that's the thing.
6943000	6944000	It is the,
6944000	6945000	uh, the glasses.
6945000	6948000	That's really all I can say about it cause it didn't really do for many games,
6948000	6951000	but you get kind of this blinking effect on the screen cause they're gonna try
6951000	6952000	to combine it.
6952000	6954000	It's almost the same way.
6954000	6956000	I think that it works on,
6956000	6957000	um,
6958000	6960000	the kind of the lenticular style,
6960000	6961000	right?
6961000	6962000	Like,
6962000	6963000	um, the 3ds does.
6963000	6964000	Yeah.
6964000	6966000	I think that with the shutters,
6966000	6967000	like,
6967000	6968000	um,
6968000	6969000	a lot of 3d TVs,
6969000	6971000	I think kind of use that same type of stuff now because I have a TV,
6971000	6972000	a 3d glasses that uses the shutter,
6972000	6973000	but it's all,
6973000	6975000	obviously the technology is very advanced,
6975000	6976000	so it's kind of faster.
6976000	6978000	You get the full frames and everything.
6978000	6979000	When you're looking at the screen though,
6979000	6980000	without the glasses.
6980000	6981000	Yeah,
6981000	6982000	it's a little funny cause you have one,
6982000	6983000	but actually what I was noticing,
6983000	6986000	you can stare at the screen like it's one of those,
6986000	6987000	um, stereo pictures.
6987000	6988000	You know what I'm talking about?
6988000	6991000	Can you see the whale or whatever it was?
6991000	6992000	Sailboat.
6992000	6993000	Sailboat.
6993000	6994000	Yeah.
6994000	6995000	More of a schooner.
6995000	6996000	But you can,
6996000	6999000	you can see it kind of hurts your eyes to do it for a while,
6999000	7001000	but like watching you cause obviously,
7001000	7002000	Oh my gosh,
7002000	7003000	y'all were using YouTube's.
7003000	7004000	Um,
7004000	7005000	but watching this guy play on YouTube,
7005000	7006000	like if I stare just right,
7006000	7007000	I can see it in the 3d.
7007000	7008000	So it's kind of,
7008000	7009000	yeah,
7009000	7010000	no glasses needed,
7010000	7011000	but it kind of hurts my eyes.
7011000	7012000	Yeah.
7012000	7013000	You don't want to like,
7013000	7015000	you know how like they always say your face will freeze that way.
7015000	7016000	I'm making that face.
7016000	7017000	I feel like my eyes are going to freeze.
7017000	7019000	It's like when I would save my 3d animal crossing screenshots,
7019000	7021000	they were actually two pictures.
7021000	7022000	Yes.
7022000	7023000	So it's the same effect.
7023000	7024000	It's magic.
7024000	7025000	Yes it is.
7025000	7026000	There it is.
7026000	7027000	All right.
7027000	7028000	So yeah,
7028000	7029000	there you go.
7029000	7030000	There it is.
7030000	7032000	Your classic peripheral of the month for September confirmed August was the
7032000	7033000	sewing machine.
7033000	7034000	Oh,
7034000	7035000	that's my gosh.
7035000	7036000	Time flies.
7036000	7037000	Anyway,
7037000	7038000	there it is.
7038000	7039000	The classic peripheral of the month,
7039000	7041000	the Sega scope 3d glasses.
7041000	7042000	Um,
7042000	7044000	we have a little extra time here for the segments.
7044000	7045000	Since that didn't take you very long.
7045000	7046000	Um,
7046000	7047000	what else should we talk about?
7047000	7048000	How has some house?
7048000	7049000	Wow.
7049000	7050000	Been treating you if,
7050000	7051000	if your journey,
7051000	7052000	your journey back,
7052000	7053000	I'm doing the Argus content.
7053000	7055000	Cause I kind of stopped playing for a little bit when that came out.
7055000	7056000	So I'm really enjoying it.
7056000	7057000	Cause it's all,
7057000	7058000	you know,
7058000	7059000	space,
7059000	7060000	self demon husband.
7060000	7061000	Um,
7061000	7062000	cause I'm an Illidan fangirl.
7062000	7063000	So I've really been enjoying it.
7063000	7064000	Um,
7064000	7065000	I'm really enjoying the stories.
7065000	7066000	Cool single area back.
7066000	7069000	Are you playing with the game boy boys or like kind of being a loner?
7069000	7071000	The only person who I've seen on was spike.
7071000	7072000	Okay.
7072000	7073000	So,
7073000	7074000	so,
7074000	7075000	um,
7075000	7078000	that spike gets around cause I saw him in overwatch the other day too.
7078000	7083000	So I got a cappuccino today that they put an overwatch symbol on and cocoa.
7083000	7084000	What?
7084000	7085000	It was at this,
7085000	7086000	um,
7086000	7087000	comic book store.
7087000	7088000	Oh,
7088000	7089000	Oh yeah.
7089000	7090000	I know that place.
7090000	7091000	The,
7091000	7092000	yes.
7092000	7093000	I think it's overwatch.
7093000	7094000	No,
7094000	7097000	the number one gaming podcast in town does stuff with that place.
7097000	7098000	So I'm not surprised at all.
7098000	7100000	Cause I know they're big overwatch fans over there.
7100000	7101000	So what?
7101000	7102000	Number one,
7102000	7103000	like P
7103000	7104000	no,
7104000	7105000	we're fans of everybody.
7105000	7106000	We just have to be a little,
7106000	7107000	you know,
7107000	7108000	I'm a shady fan.
7108000	7109000	Yeah.
7109000	7110000	But anyway,
7110000	7111000	in all seriousness,
7111000	7112000	I know what place you're talking about.
7112000	7113000	Yeah.
7113000	7114000	Yeah.
7114000	7115000	So that's really cute.
7115000	7116000	I like that.
7116000	7117000	So,
7117000	7118000	um,
7118000	7119000	I have,
7119000	7120000	I had an overwatch cappuccino and then,
7120000	7121000	um,
7121000	7124000	I saw the little mermaid at the crust theater and it was fun.
7124000	7125000	That's fun.
7125000	7126000	Um,
7126000	7127000	you know what you didn't see?
7127000	7128000	That makes me sad.
7128000	7131200	You did not see the mass effect voice actors panel that I did a dragon con and you need
7131200	7132200	to,
7132200	7133200	you need to,
7133200	7134200	uh,
7134200	7135200	I really,
7135200	7136200	really,
7136200	7137200	really bitter,
7137200	7138200	like bad coffee,
7138200	7139200	Rob.
7139200	7140200	I really,
7140200	7141200	really,
7141200	7142200	really want to get Courtney Taylor on the show.
7142200	7143200	She did the voice of Jack.
7143200	7144200	Um,
7144200	7145200	she's got this great chair.
7145200	7146200	I'll give it a shot.
7146200	7147200	I'm going to give this a shout out for free cause I love what she's doing.
7147200	7148200	Um,
7148200	7149200	I know her and I think it's Mary Elizabeth McGlynn,
7149200	7150200	uh,
7150200	7151200	put on this nerds vote.
7151200	7152200	Uh,
7152200	7153200	so they're trying to,
7153200	7154200	they go to conventions and they register nerds to vote.
7154200	7155200	Um,
7155200	7156200	you know,
7156200	7157200	cause it's all about getting people where they're,
7157200	7158200	they're not partisan.
7158200	7159200	They're not going to tell you to register one way or the other.
7159200	7161200	Make sure you get registered because,
7161200	7162200	um,
7162200	7163200	voting is like really important.
7163200	7165200	I'll tell you who to vote for.
7165200	7166200	Not right now though.
7166200	7167200	I know you will.
7167200	7169200	You reach out on Twitter and you'll happily say,
7169200	7170200	but I'm,
7170200	7172200	I'm pretty sure if you did reach out to these people,
7172200	7173200	they would have their own opinions too.
7173200	7174200	However,
7174200	7178200	we put all that aside to just get people registered so that their voices can be
7178200	7179200	heard.
7179200	7180200	Just like Mr.
7180200	7181200	voice is so loud right now.
7181200	7182200	He's probably picking up on the,
7182200	7183200	um,
7183200	7184200	microphone.
7184200	7185200	He's very upset about something.
7185200	7186200	All right.
7186200	7187200	Anyway,
7187200	7188200	he got boob perching time,
7189200	7190200	which by the way,
7190200	7191200	if you guys don't know,
7191200	7192200	Mr.
7192200	7193200	Smoosh will hang out like Mr.
7193200	7194200	Smoosh,
7194200	7195200	you know,
7195200	7196200	is usually not the pickup type of cat.
7196200	7197200	I can't pick them up.
7197200	7198200	Alan can't pick them up,
7198200	7200200	but Jamie can pick up Mr.
7200200	7203200	Smoosh because Jamie has a certain pair of boobs.
7203200	7204200	Yes,
7204200	7205200	she has boobs and triple D's.
7205200	7207200	Apparently you can stand on them.
7207200	7208200	Mr.
7208200	7211200	Smoosh is very clearly a straight cat because he loves the boobs.
7211200	7212200	I mean,
7212200	7213200	even gay men like,
7213200	7214200	I know I was gonna say,
7214200	7215200	actually I know a lot of gay men that loves boobs,
7215200	7216200	but he's,
7216200	7217200	you know,
7217200	7219200	he's very attached to your,
7219200	7220200	your breath.
7220200	7222200	I'm a little though angry with myself.
7222200	7223200	Speaking of gay things.
7223200	7224200	Okay.
7224200	7226200	Cause I have something for you at my house.
7226200	7227200	Have you,
7227200	7228200	I got unicorn cereal.
7228200	7230200	I think Kellogg's unicorn cereal.
7230200	7231200	You sent me the text yesterday.
7231200	7232200	It looks hilarious.
7232200	7233200	Yes.
7233200	7234200	It's on,
7234200	7235200	it's on my table.
7235200	7236200	I didn't go back home or I would have brought it.
7236200	7237200	What do unicorns taste like?
7237200	7238200	Rainbows and sheet cakes.
7238200	7240200	I played a unicorn card game today.
7240200	7241200	And I already forgot the name of it.
7241200	7242200	Is it exploding?
7242200	7243200	It's the,
7243200	7244200	it's the exploding kittens,
7244200	7245200	but the unicorn game.
7245200	7246200	Like farting unicorns or something?
7246200	7247200	No,
7247200	7248200	it's a magical unicorns or something.
7248200	7249200	I don't remember,
7249200	7250200	but I won.
7250200	7251200	It was fun.
7251200	7252200	Well,
7252200	7253200	I want to do a giveaway on the show.
7253200	7254200	I haven't decided what,
7254200	7255200	but I mean how,
7255200	7256200	how to do it,
7256200	7257200	but I know what I'm going to give.
7257200	7258200	There's,
7258200	7259200	there's always that point system on VOG for checking in and we haven't done the
7259200	7260200	giveaway on there forever.
7260200	7262200	I'm going to do a glitter pack from,
7262200	7263200	uh,
7263200	7264200	uh,
7264200	7265200	cards against humanity.
7265200	7266200	Oh,
7266200	7267200	you're going to actually send.
7267200	7268200	I have five of them and I'll give,
7268200	7270200	I'll give one to a listener if they don't suck.
7270200	7271200	Okay.
7271200	7272200	Well,
7272200	7273200	I do.
7273200	7274200	Do you want them to tweet you or how do you want to do that?
7274200	7275200	I'll figure it out.
7275200	7276200	Just know that it's coming.
7276200	7279200	Stay tuned for next week when Jamie like figures it out.
7279200	7280200	All right.
7280200	7281200	Anyway.
7281200	7282200	Mail the mailbox and make Rob check it.
7282200	7283200	He'll tell me.
7283200	7284200	Participate at orangeonsharing.com.
7284200	7285200	Okay.
7285200	7286200	We're also brought Rob candy.
7286200	7288200	We're here to wrap up the classic game of the week.
7288200	7289200	So the Sega 3d glasses.
7289200	7290200	Yes.
7290200	7291200	Yes.
7291200	7292200	All right.
7292200	7293200	Uh,
7293200	7294200	any last thoughts before we get back to the main show?
7294200	7295200	I want Chinese food.
7295200	7296200	That's it.
7303200	7304200	Thank you,
7304200	7305200	Jamie for the segment.
7305200	7307200	We miss having her here live in studio,
7307200	7309200	but I think she's going to be here at the end of the month.
7309200	7310200	Uh,
7310200	7311200	while she's still,
7311200	7312200	you know,
7312200	7313200	again,
7313200	7314200	if you are not already aware,
7314200	7315200	even though he said this on a show a million times,
7315200	7316200	she has a conflict with her,
7316200	7317200	you know,
7317200	7318200	paying day job schedule.
7318200	7319200	Unfortunately,
7319200	7320200	she has to work Sundays right now,
7320200	7321200	so she can't be with us during the live shows.
7321200	7322200	So we're trying to at least still include her,
7322200	7323200	uh,
7323200	7324200	through,
7324200	7325200	through the magic of radio,
7325200	7326200	uh,
7326200	7327200	with her classic game of the week segment.
7327200	7328200	And then,
7328200	7329200	um,
7329200	7330200	hopefully we'll,
7330200	7331200	you know,
7331200	7332200	be able to have her here at least once a month.
7332200	7333200	I know that's her plan.
7333200	7334200	Um,
7334200	7336200	we're going to get back into the show and we've still got a lot of news to
7336200	7337200	come.
7337200	7338200	We're running pretty long tonight,
7338200	7341200	so we're going to try to try to catch up here a little bit,
7341200	7343200	but we do still want to have plenty of time to take your calls.
7343200	7345200	Orange lounge radio on Skype,
7345200	7346200	uh,
7346200	7347200	a little later in the show.
7347200	7348200	Uh,
7348200	7349200	also just a couple of quick things cause it was asked about,
7349200	7350200	you know,
7350200	7353200	cause obviously this whole announcement about the Twitch move eventually,
7353200	7354200	um,
7354200	7355200	is,
7355200	7356200	you know,
7356200	7357200	caused a lot of chat,
7357200	7358200	which by the way,
7358200	7359200	one way I also kind of explained this to somebody that I think may help you
7359200	7361200	kind of understand where this is coming from,
7361200	7362200	you know,
7362200	7363200	why we're making a move like this.
7363200	7364200	Just think about this.
7364200	7369200	How many shout cast streams have you searched for to listen to in the past
7369200	7372200	month versus how many Twitch streams have you looked for?
7372200	7376200	And maybe the answer for you in particular is zero,
7376200	7379200	but ask about 10 or 20 of your nerd friends,
7379200	7380200	that same question.
7380200	7382200	And I think you'll completely like,
7382200	7383200	I think what's that?
7383200	7384200	Which show cast?
7384200	7385200	I know,
7385200	7386200	right?
7386200	7387200	Or are we talking about shot?
7387200	7389200	Are we talking about a commentating over video games?
7389200	7390200	Cause that's what they call that now.
7390200	7391200	You know,
7391200	7392200	one of Bobby's panels was about shout casting,
7392200	7393200	but it was not,
7393200	7395200	it was not the software.
7395200	7396200	It was that's comp.
7396200	7398200	That's what they call commentating over video games.
7398200	7400200	So that was actually a really fascinating panel,
7400200	7401200	by the way,
7401200	7402200	I wish,
7402200	7404200	I wish some of those would be online for you to listen to later,
7404200	7405200	but I guess this is part of the reason you have to be there.
7405200	7406200	Uh,
7406200	7407200	anyhow,
7407200	7408200	uh,
7408200	7409200	fifth dream says,
7409200	7410200	I forgot,
7410200	7411200	we'll vog still be on tune in.
7411200	7412200	Um,
7412200	7413200	no,
7413200	7414200	uh,
7414200	7415200	when this goes into effect,
7415200	7416200	uh,
7416200	7418200	the goal is that that will be sunset it actually that because tune in is
7418200	7419200	simply a shout cast directory,
7419200	7420200	basically for that.
7420200	7421200	Um,
7421200	7422200	and that will be sunsetted.
7422200	7423200	Um,
7423200	7424200	so that is part of the change,
7424200	7425200	uh,
7425200	7426200	that's going to,
7426200	7427200	uh,
7427200	7428200	be,
7428200	7429200	uh,
7429200	7430200	coming into play here.
7430200	7431200	Um,
7431200	7432200	but then,
7432200	7433200	uh,
7433200	7434200	what else did I want to say there with,
7434200	7435200	um,
7435200	7436200	the questions and so forth that we were getting,
7436200	7437200	um,
7437200	7438200	uh,
7438200	7439200	there was something else,
7439200	7440200	so I guess I'll think of it later.
7440200	7441200	Uh,
7441200	7442200	in the meantime,
7442200	7443200	let's get into some rapid fire news.
7443200	7444200	Uh,
7444200	7445200	Oh,
7445200	7446200	it was the Skype real quick.
7446200	7447200	Uh,
7448200	7450200	will we be able to show your video out on the video?
7450200	7451200	Um,
7451200	7452200	hypothetically,
7452200	7453200	yes,
7453200	7455200	I can't guarantee that's going to be in place day one,
7455200	7456200	but that is,
7456200	7459200	let me say the goal is to continue to take calls on Skype just as we always
7459200	7461200	have been at least for now.
7461200	7462200	Um,
7462200	7463200	in all honesty,
7463200	7465200	I'm aware a lot of Twitch people use discord to take their calls.
7465200	7466200	Uh,
7466200	7468200	it's something in the back of my mind,
7468200	7469200	but one,
7469200	7472200	one big change at a time is enough.
7472200	7475200	Let's try to keep everything else normal for now.
7475200	7476200	All right,
7476200	7477200	let's move on.
7477200	7478200	Uh,
7478200	7479200	some rapid fire news.
7479200	7480200	Loki.
7480200	7481200	Uh,
7481200	7482200	so,
7482200	7483200	uh,
7483200	7485200	Metro Metro Exodus has been delayed to 2019,
7485200	7487200	which is kind of weird cause I thought it was coming out in 2019.
7487200	7489200	I was unaware that it was actually scheduled for this year,
7489200	7493200	but apparently it is going to be delayed.
7493200	7496200	The development of Metro Exodus is progressing well.
7496200	7499200	We are really excited by what we're seeing.
7499200	7500200	We have constantly,
7500200	7501200	um,
7501200	7505200	we're constantly reviewing the games progress to ensure that we deliver a
7505200	7509200	product that gamers and fans of the Metro series want and deserve.
7509200	7513200	And as well as keeping an eye on announcements from our competitor,
7513200	7514200	it ain't finished.
7514200	7516200	Just put out a three WordPress release.
7516200	7517200	It ain't finished.
7517200	7518200	It's ambitious.
7518200	7519200	We need more time.
7519200	7521200	So Q1 2019,
7521200	7522200	we,
7522200	7526200	we don't want this game to turn out like mass effect Andromeda.
7526200	7527200	So,
7527200	7529200	which had already been delayed several times.
7529200	7532200	We will just have to wait a little longer.
7532200	7533200	All right.
7533200	7534200	Um,
7534200	7539200	and then something else that's going to be coming out on PlayStation VR is
7539200	7541200	space shell five there.
7541200	7545200	They have a version that's going to be coming out on PlayStation VR as well as
7545200	7546200	the HTC Vive.
7546200	7547200	Uh,
7547200	7550200	no details yet on when we can expect that,
7550200	7555200	but apparently they've had a VR version in the arcades in Japan for a while
7555200	7556200	now.
7556200	7557200	Um,
7557200	7559200	and I think that the game is supposed to be,
7559200	7562200	I don't know if it follows the exact,
7562200	7563200	you know,
7563200	7565200	format as the first game,
7565200	7566200	but basically,
7566200	7567200	you know,
7567200	7570200	same premise and everything fighting the aliens and stuff like that rhythm
7570200	7571200	game.
7571200	7572200	Um,
7572200	7574200	I'll definitely check it out when it comes out over here,
7574200	7576200	whenever that is,
7576200	7579200	I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
7579200	7580200	All right.
7580200	7581200	Well,
7581200	7582200	let's move on.
7582200	7583200	So you remember,
7583200	7584200	um,
7584200	7585200	it was on the last episode of OLR before we took a,
7585200	7586200	the break here,
7586200	7588200	but we talked about how the last remnant was going to be delisted from the
7588200	7589200	Xbox.
7589200	7590200	Yes.
7590200	7591200	Or as you know,
7591200	7592200	it was delisted from steam.
7592200	7593200	It was delisted from the Xbox.
7593200	7594200	We never really got an answer on that,
7594200	7595200	but,
7595200	7596200	uh,
7596200	7597200	we know the physical edition is available.
7597200	7598200	Well,
7598200	7599200	I think we figured out why,
7599200	7602200	because the last remnant remastered is on its way for the PlayStation four.
7602200	7603200	That is something that,
7603200	7604200	uh,
7604200	7605200	they announced this week.
7605200	7606200	Uh,
7606200	7607200	I don't know though.
7607200	7609200	Is this something that like we need Loki?
7609200	7611200	Is this a game that needs to be remastered?
7611200	7612200	I don't know.
7612200	7613200	No,
7613200	7614200	not really,
7614200	7615200	but hell they're remastered all the other games.
7615200	7616200	So why not?
7616200	7617200	Yeah.
7617200	7618200	Why not?
7618200	7619200	Right.
7619200	7620200	So anyway,
7620200	7621200	I can't think of anything to make.
7621200	7623200	This will be a PlayStation four exclusive,
7623200	7624200	uh,
7624200	7625200	and it's going to be out worldwide on December 6th.
7625200	7627200	And I believe it is only something you can download.
7627200	7628200	It's not going to be something you can,
7628200	7629200	uh,
7629200	7630200	go buy in a store.
7630200	7631200	So,
7631200	7632200	uh,
7632200	7633200	check that out.
7633200	7634200	I suppose if that's something that you're into.
7634200	7637200	Also a follow up on a game we talked about a long time ago on this show,
7637200	7641200	you'd have to go all the way back to episode 571.
7641200	7645200	When we had the developer of time spinner on this game on the show,
7645200	7646200	you remember time spinner,
7646200	7647200	uh,
7647200	7648200	time spinner,
7648200	7649200	uh,
7649200	7651200	the date for a PlayStation four Vita and PC.
7651200	7653200	It is finally coming out,
7653200	7654200	which is a great news.
7654200	7655200	They are,
7655200	7656200	were announced for,
7656200	7657200	I think,
7657200	7658200	um,
7658200	7659200	let's see,
7659200	7660200	what is the big,
7660200	7661200	I'm trying to find the date that was actually announced here.
7661200	7662200	Uh,
7662200	7664200	because we started seeing some of the trailers and stuff.
7664200	7665200	There it is.
7665200	7666200	Thank you.
7666200	7667200	September 25th,
7667200	7668200	uh,
7668200	7669200	is the day that this will be out.
7669200	7670200	Uh,
7670200	7671200	obviously that was,
7671200	7672200	that was a while ago that we did in this interview.
7672200	7673200	So I know this game has been in development for a while,
7673200	7674200	but,
7674200	7675200	uh,
7675200	7676200	it's,
7676200	7677200	I,
7677200	7678200	I think,
7678200	7679200	uh,
7679200	7680200	it's,
7680200	7681200	it's,
7681200	7682200	uh,
7682200	7683200	it's been on the show and it's like,
7683200	7684200	it's him.
7684200	7685200	And he's contracted a few of the things out,
7685200	7686200	I think,
7686200	7687200	but for the most part,
7687200	7688200	it's him developing the game.
7688200	7689200	So,
7689200	7690200	um,
7690200	7691200	you know,
7691200	7692200	it's been taken time because it's a lot of work for one person.
7692200	7693200	So it's great to see that it's,
7693200	7694200	uh,
7694200	7695200	finally,
7695200	7696200	uh,
7696200	7697200	on its way to be done and he'll get to see everybody,
7697200	7698200	hopefully,
7698200	7699200	uh,
7699200	7700200	really enjoy this game.
7700200	7701200	It looks great.
7701200	7702200	Like as far as like the pixel art and everything,
7702200	7703200	it really looks gorgeous.
7703200	7704200	So,
7704200	7705200	uh,
7705200	7706200	really happy for Bodie.
7706200	7707200	Can't wait to play it myself.
7707200	7708200	I was up in Seattle once.
7708200	7709200	It's great.
7709200	7710200	Really nice guy.
7710200	7711200	So very happy for his,
7711200	7712200	um,

7713200	7714200	Hope he,
7714200	7715200	hope he does very well with time spinner.
7715200	7716200	I'll have to see if you come back on the show.
7716200	7717200	Once the game is released,
7717200	7718200	I think that would be a lot of fun.
7718200	7719200	All right.
7719200	7720200	Let's see what's going to be out a little sooner though.

7990200	7991200	frowny face,
7991200	7992200	but that's okay.

8001200	8005200	finally you should totally get that Julian kid back on the show.
8005200	8006200	I think that was his name.
8006200	8007200	That was quite entertaining.
8007200	8008200	Yes,
8008200	8009200	that was,
8009200	8010200	um,

8013200	8014200	right?
8014200	8015200	So we,

8017200	8018200	see what he's playing now.
8018200	8019200	Anyway,

8024200	8025200	something that he had exclaimed on that.
8025200	8026200	That I believe,
8026200	8027200	uh,
8027200	8027700	Rob,
8027700	8030200	wear a diaper next time he comes on because you were losing your shit.
8030200	8031200	Well,
8031200	8032200	that kids are funny,
8032200	8033200	uh,
8033200	8034200	which made me lose my shit because your laugh is contagious.
8034200	8035200	Thank you.
8035200	8036200	Anyway,
8036200	8037200	Miss you.
8037200	8038200	Jamie Summers,
8038200	8039200	uh,
8039200	8040200	Loki.
8040200	8041200	Keep up the Nintendo rants.
8041200	8042200	I hope you're satisfied tonight.
8042200	8043200	Uh,
8043200	8044200	and Rob,
8044200	8045200	you should totally stream more fist bump.
8045200	8046200	I'm trying buddy.
8046200	8047200	I'm trying.
8047200	8048200	Um,
8048200	8049200	if all my issues are not miraculously,
8049200	8053640	miraculously cured when Comcast comes out for the second time on Tuesday, you
8053640	8057240	can expect I'll probably do some more video-on-demand stuff. So, I mean, I did
8057240	8060560	one video pre-recorded today, so you can check that out on my channel over at
8060560	8064520	Rob Roberts. So if you want to see me lamenting about internet issues while I
8064520	8067760	play World of Warcraft, you can see that. And I might do more of that if I have to.
8067760	8072320	Let's get to an email from Robert M. on Friday, August 31st. So this would have
8072320	8076280	been while I was away at DragonCon. So Robert M. says, it's only tangentially
8076280	8079040	related to gaming, which I assume his voice in the soon-to-be-available
8079040	8085800	Spider-Man game, spoiler alert, it's out. That game was released, and apparently
8085800	8089640	it's really good. It is, and I've been on the fence of buying it, because I buy a
8089640	8092920	lot of games and I don't end up playing them, and they're, like, I buy good games
8092920	8097480	and don't end up playing them. Like, that's why I didn't buy God of War, and that's why I
8097480	8100320	haven't bought Spider-Man yet, although I am on the fence on it. It looks pretty good.
8100320	8104200	The only thing for me is that I don't get as into the comic book stuff as
8104200	8107280	other people do. I'm not a hater, I just don't, like, I don't have that. I don't
8107280	8110600	think you necessarily need to be a fan of that. Yeah, I'm hearing it's basically
8110600	8117160	Arkham Asylum and those games, but Spider-Man. And I love those Batman games. There's a lot of, like, the costumes you can unlock and stuff through the
8117160	8120720	game. You can unlock a bunch of stuff in the comics, but I don't think you
8120720	8126120	necessarily need to be, like, a super fan of Spider-Man to be able to enjoy it. Yeah, no, you really don't. So, I mean,
8126120	8130380	here, honestly, this is what did it. It came out the same day as Dragon Quest 11,
8130380	8134660	and I'm looking at him going, I already am terrible about finishing games, and
8134660	8138140	Dragon Quest 11 is going to be a 100 hour game. That's what, that's what I
8138140	8142500	believe it's quoted as. So, the main quest is somewhere around, like, 100 hours. So,
8142500	8146300	you know, that, that kind of made my decision for me. But with as much love
8146300	8148700	as Spider-Man's getting and everything that's being shared out there and all
8148700	8156500	the people streaming it and stuff, I'm tempted. I'm tempted. Anyway, let's see. The
8156500	8159900	soon-to-be-available Spider-Man game. Ah, yes. But I have been wondering for a while, who
8159940	8164380	is the Stan Lee of Detective Comics? I'm not trying to overlook Jack Kirby's
8164380	8167720	importance to Marvel, of course, and one could very well say Stan Lee is
8167720	8170740	literally the Stan Lee of Detective Comics, since he has apparently worked
8170740	8175100	with DC, but that's probably not what I'm asking. Is there a Bob Kane slash Bill
8175100	8179540	Finger, a Jerry Siegel, you can tell my comic book knowledge is not very good,
8179540	8185260	slash Joel Shuster? Who has that level of prominence, or is that indicative of the
8185260	8190420	studio's problems? Well, if my only, my only basis on that is with the Lego
8190420	8196620	games, and I don't, their equivalent, because Stan Lee was like the, you know,
8196620	8201260	collectible guy that was in all of the, you know, Lego Marvel games, and then the
8201260	8209020	DC side, it was Adam West. So, that doesn't really work now. I don't really think
8209020	8214180	there is anybody that's kind of like that. But then again, I'm not a huge DC fan, so
8214220	8219580	fuck if I know. That, that DC side's all fucking mess right now. At least in the,
8219580	8225100	like, entertainment world, it's just kind of, they don't know what the fuck they're
8225100	8229380	doing. Okay, so thank, thank God to having a chat room that can help me out here,
8229380	8233060	because I don't know a lot about comics. Fifth Dream in chat says, DC doesn't have
8233060	8237980	that face. Ironically, closest thing is another Lee, Jim, and Captain Spike agrees
8237980	8241300	that I was gonna say Jim Lee. Captain Spike also saying, I'm trying to play
8241340	8247820	Spidey and Dragon Quest XI. Both amazing games paired with, wow, I'm so game ADD
8247820	8252500	right now. You know, hashtag the struggle. Tiger Claw says, there's a Stan Lee cameo
8252500	8255620	in Spider-Man. Of course there is. Of course there is. So, there you go. You know,
8255620	8261100	speaking of, Matt, here's how I can tie it. There was a Stan Lee cameo in the Teen
8261100	8264700	Titans Go movie. There's a Stan Lee cameo in everything. And it was hilarious. All
8264700	8267300	right, there's gonna be a Stan Lee cameo on this show, hopefully, before it ends.
8267740	8272380	All right, so here's the thing. Here's the thing. One thing I can talk about is the
8272380	8277020	video game stuff. And what about like faces of companies? Because like with
8277020	8283060	Nintendo, you've got like, you know, obviously, Miyamoto, Reggie Fils-Aime, you
8283060	8287420	know, when, why many people were so effective when Iwata passed as he was
8287420	8290620	really, you know, the face when it came to the directs and so forth. And they have,
8290620	8294620	they have Nintendo has a new president now. That was him in that direct, wasn't
8294620	8298460	it? That led that direct. That was the new Nintendo president, wasn't it? It
8298460	8301500	looked like him. I didn't, the problem is I didn't catch the very, very beginning.
8301500	8307540	Maybe somebody else can. Yeah. Um, but anyway. Oh yes. Thank you. Bobby Blackwolf
8307540	8310220	does confirm it was the new president. Cause I remember they had picked a
8310220	8314300	younger guy and you know, so that was him. So anyway. Um, so you know, Nintendo
8314300	8317460	kind of has our faces. Microsoft has like, I don't know, like Major Nelson,
8317700	8319780	especially when it comes to like social media, it's kind of like the face of
8319780	8327820	Microsoft. What does Sony have? Ridge Racer. I guess like it's Ridge Racer.
8327860	8332660	There's the whole PlayStation blog folks, you know, there's a variety, there's a
8332660	8336620	whole variety. There's people there, you know, they, and they kind of, you know, I
8336620	8339820	don't know, like you see them at E3, but they're, you know, they got the, they got
8339820	8344380	the stuff that they have online parody account, but then that's gone. Yeah. So
8344380	8347300	what do they have left? Nothing. I don't know. Like it's just, I don't know. It
8347300	8351380	doesn't feel the same. It's not one person. It's, it's a, you have to
8351380	8354740	understand that the PlayStation brand is so strong. They don't need
8354740	8358780	representatives like that to help bolster the, you know, the appearance of
8358780	8361660	the PlayStation brand, the PlayStation branches. It's, it's its own
8361660	8366820	spokesperson. But that being said though, the best spokesperson that they
8366820	8371940	had was the fake CEO or whatever. No, uh, the vice president, the fake vice
8371940	8377020	president guy that was, uh, he was an actor. It was, I forget his name, but
8377020	8381100	like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Fucking awesome. They just made him the real vice
8381100	8386940	president cause he's fucking Kevin Butler is long live Kevin Butler. Um,
8386940	8392220	let's see, uh, Sony has David Jaffe says, uh, Bobby black Wolf. I don't know
8392220	8397820	if that's the same thing though. Anyway, I guess it doesn't really matter. I'm
8397820	8401100	just getting curious. Video games kind of have their faces too. All right,
8401340	8405660	let's get to an email from the day before the canceled show. So September
8405660	8410500	8th and this is from while I are who says, hello, LR, by the time you read
8410500	8412980	this, I'll finally have caught up on the episodes I missed while we had a
8412980	8416380	newborn. Well, babies are important. Uh, but of course I had the email about
8416380	8419780	some things you probably forgot about already during rapid fire news in early
8419780	8424300	August. I can't remember last week. Here's the email where you get called
8424300	8430300	out on all this shit we did wrong over the guys in episode two. I have the
8430340	8436540	following list of problematic incidents from the past. I'm teasing why we love
8436540	8440020	why we'll allow it. Yeah, we're only allowing it because of why we are all
8440020	8444740	right during rapid fire news. Sorry, probably black hole says this is an
8444740	8450220	airing of grievances. All right, no, you're wrong. That's an Aaron of
8450220	8455460	grievance. Okay, here comes why we are during rapid fire news in early August.
8455500	8460380	Loki expressed enthusiasm at the success of indie 3d platformer a hat in
8460380	8464700	time and said he was looking forward to trying it himself. Before that happens, I
8464700	8467580	want to make sure you're aware of some issues with the people behind the game.
8467700	8473060	Oh shit, this really is about problematic stuff. Oh, that'll teach me
8473060	8476940	to make a joke before I read the rest. Let's go. Let's hear about it. All
8476940	8480460	right here. First of all, you may remember someone by the name of John
8480460	8485140	Jafari, or perhaps you know him by his nickname, John Tron. Oh, I've heard
8485140	8489380	of it. I already know where this is going now. Uh, if you need a refresher,
8489380	8492660	he's a popular YouTube personality. And early last year, there was a bit of
8492660	8496180	an uproar when he went on several openly racist rants. You may also
8496180	8499820	remember the indie platformer ukulele had cast John Tron to deliver some
8499820	8503020	voice work for the game following his racist rants and the outcry that
8503020	8506380	followed the ukulele developers did the right thing and scrubbed John Tron's
8506380	8509940	voice in the game. Guess what? John Tron also did voice work for a hat in
8509940	8512580	time. You'd expect that the folks in charge of this game would have done
8512580	8515660	the right thing. But not only did they not remove his voice, they never
8515660	8519260	even offered a statement regarding John Tron as racist behavior or their
8519260	8522060	decision to keep his voice in their game. I interpret this as an
8522060	8525140	acceptance or perhaps even an endorsement of this behavior by the
8525140	8528380	games lead developers. If this wasn't enough, you should also know that the
8528380	8531020	lead game designer was previously involved in a dispute with a former
8531020	8534580	colleague. When the dispute was not resolved to their liking, they decided
8534580	8538060	to create a slander website for the purpose of doxing this person
8538260	8542260	prominently featuring their personal contact information. Now I'm sure that
8542260	8545420	many other people contributed a lot of hard work to this game artists,
8545420	8548580	musicians, other voice actors, programmers, designers and so forth.
8548740	8551540	But it's likely that they've already been paid for their work. And then
8551540	8553940	when you buy a copy of this game, the money is going to the people at the
8553940	8557540	top of it. Exactly the people who I don't want to give my money to. So I
8557540	8560860	will never buy it. I will never play it. I've been trying my best to spread
8560860	8563340	the word about it. And I encourage potential buyers to take their money
8563340	8566420	somewhere elsewhere instead. Let me ask you a tricky quote because the
8566420	8569500	rest of his email gets another point. Why is Mr. Smoosh jumping up on the
8569500	8573500	table like he's going to jump up on Loki's little mini table there that he
8573500	8576820	uses with his laptop? Maybe he will. Maybe he will. All right. Let's see
8576820	8579860	what happens. I think he might know. He's like, fuck that. All right. I'm
8579860	8585660	sorry. Sorry. My cat is far more interesting than fucking racist assholes
8585660	8591860	on the internet. Anyway. Okay. So Loki, let me ask you this question. Is it
8591860	8595700	then acceptable to steal the game under these circumstances? Is piracy
8595700	8598420	justified in this case? No, don't answer that. Don't answer. That's a
8598420	8601060	slippery slope. I don't want to go down. I don't answer it. Don't. It's
8601060	8604980	the same reason. Like, you know, I'm still going to watch like mission
8604980	8609140	impossible, even though I don't necessarily, I don't endorse, you know,
8609140	8614260	Scientology or anything like that. When, when can I like draw the line
8614260	8617420	between the people that make the content and the content itself? Like,
8617420	8620620	when can I just say, I just want to enjoy the content without the drama
8620620	8623980	behind the content? Like, I don't need to know the personal backgrounds of
8624060	8626460	all these, which is why you said you were interested in the game in the
8626460	8628980	first place, because you had no idea about any of this stuff. You're just
8628980	8633620	like, Oh, this looks neat. Exactly. Like, I, I don't need that. I don't
8633620	8636020	need to know the resumes of all the people that fucking worked at the
8636020	8639660	country and all, or the company and all the bad shit that they did here. So
8639660	8642380	there's enough bad shit out there. There is, there is a lot of bad shit
8642380	8645980	out here. And like, it's like, I totally kind of get what YYR is saying.
8645980	8648260	Like now that I'm hearing all this, I'm like, well, I didn't know much
8648260	8651740	about this game and now I don't really want to, well, you're probably in
8651740	8654340	luck because I'm going to be probably too lazy to buy it. Anyway,
8654340	8657060	unless it comes in a humble bundle sale or something like that. So it's
8657060	8659940	fine. I probably won't end up actually playing it. I just said it looked
8659940	8663460	neat. Like I saw it actually was on sale this week and I was like, yeah,
8663500	8668460	not, not sale enough. So I, I didn't end up purchasing it, but it still
8668460	8671220	looks neat. But once again, it's a neat game that I'm not going to have
8671220	8675060	time to play anyway. So, you know, there's a lot of other neat games that
8675060	8678780	come out before that. We think, you know, Spiderman, red dead redemption
8678780	8681820	right around the fucking corner. Like Jesus Christ, never going to have
8681820	8683020	time to play any of these games.
8683100	8687980	Can everybody just try harder to not be an asshole? Like how, like, do you,
8688020	8692860	do you know how easy it is to not say racist things? It's really easy.
8693140	8696220	Don't say them. You just don't say them.
8696220	8698140	But then I have to stop taking my ambient.
8701420	8705620	No Loki. That's not how it works. Ambien does not make you racist. Ambien
8705620	8708180	does not make you racist contrary to what some, you know, former
8708180	8712260	entertainers, uh, from yesteryear will try to tell you. Just, just why,
8712820	8716620	just can't people in general, just like not be racist. Like it's really
8716620	8722300	easy to not be racist. You just don't be racist and don't commit sexual
8722300	8727900	assault. Yes. That's yeah. They don't, don't rape. I mean, it's such a, I
8727900	8730700	mean, I know we don't teach people this. What we do teach people is how
8730700	8733940	to avoid being raped, but what we should teach people is like, maybe
8733940	8737500	just maybe don't do that. Don't. And like, I'm, I'm, I'm not trying to
8737500	8739980	make light of it. Like, this isn't even a joke. I'm like saying, don't,
8739980	8743500	don't do it. You all know. I know you all are, you guys listening out there.
8743500	8749500	Remember the three R's. Okay. The three R's don't rape. Don't be racist.
8749700	8755180	Don't rep for Scientology. Okay. I kind of think two of those things are
8755180	8758820	far worse than one, but a fair enough. All right. Uh, let's see. Going to
8758820	8762980	chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Uh, Puba in chat says everyone has
8762980	8765900	their personal subjective lines. I think it's okay for YYR to boycott.
8765900	8770300	And I think it's okay to low key to not care. Um, and what's interesting,
8770300	8773980	YYR says, I'll eat Chick-fil-A when they're open on Sunday. So Jesus
8773980	8776940	Christ, I wish they would open on Sunday because they're just pretty
8776940	8781340	good. Like, I don't get why they, so here's the thing, and this might
8781340	8785020	surprise you. I'm not one of those people that's up and up to like, I'm
8785020	8788940	not, even though I get that Chick-fil-A has their, their president has
8788940	8792780	donated money to anti LGBT causes. And I think that's fucking gross.
8793100	8796140	I think a lot of people have donated money to anti LGBT causes and that's
8796140	8801860	also fucking gross. And what works is education. The boycotts don't
8801860	8805580	really work in that regard. I mean, and that's kind of on both sides of
8805580	8809260	the fence, like the Chick-fil-A slot or, or look, look at Nike. Their
8809260	8812780	shares are up like 34 or there. Yeah. Their, their stock value is up like
8812780	8817180	34% with all those people like burning their shoes and shit because, which
8817180	8823700	by the way, remember what we said, don't be racist. But anyway, um, trying
8823700	8826140	to, try to avoid a slippery slope, but it's really hard sometimes you
8826140	8830660	guys. Uh, anyway, my, my thought with the whole Chick-fil-A thing is I, I
8830660	8834140	do eat Chick-fil-A because here's the thing, like the local franchise
8834140	8837020	owner, and you can look this up for yourself, actually donates to pro
8837020	8841260	LGBT causes here locally to offset some of the stuff that the corporate
8841260	8846060	does. I have many gay friends who worked at Chick-fil-A who've said
8846060	8849340	that their experiences were actually really positive. They were treated
8849340	8852980	well and all this other stuff. So like, I'm not, excuse me, I, I hate, I
8852980	8856500	hate the fact that the money has gone to anti LGBT causes, but I have
8856500	8861820	also seen just from myself that, um, I have been able to change many more
8861820	8866460	minds by sharing my story, by sharing like who I am and the fact that
8866540	8871340	being gay is not a choice. It is the way that, you know, the, the same
8871340	8874860	God that you believe in made me just like he made you and all that stuff.
8874860	8878140	And, and these things are, are, you know, it's, it's my life that people
8878140	8882140	are trying to, you know, be against with, with things like conversion
8882140	8885820	therapy and all this garbage stuff out there. I think education goes a
8885820	8889740	much farther way than you're canceled because you eat Chick-fil-A.
8891380	8894060	That's just kind of my take on the whole thing. I would rather educate
8894060	8899380	people as to why, you know, anti LGBT causes are, uh, honestly, it's a
8899380	8903460	waste of money in one regard. But anyway, that's a whole nother thing.
8904420	8908620	Uh, act-deaf in chat says, I know many LGBT people that go to Coachella
8908620	8911140	each year, despite the parent company that owns the festival, donates to
8911140	8916860	anti LGBT causes. Um, so you know what, and, and, and, and honestly, if
8916860	8920020	you're going to send that email to me that talks about how you can't
8920020	8922420	believe that I just sat here and said, sure, I'll eat Chick-fil-A.
8922420	8925540	Okay. I don't eat it every day. Uh, but I'll eat it once in a while.
8925700	8929460	Uh, if you're about to send me that thing, um, just know you're giving me
8929460	8932300	an invite to come through your house so I can point out everything
8932300	8937260	problematic that you own. I think in my, my mind, I guess my point is
8937260	8940980	the question is not like the boycotting and the don't do this. And that's
8940980	8944940	like, that's only going to go so far. What are we really doing to change
8944940	8948300	minds? Cause honestly, one of the first things I'm always going to ask
8948300	8950540	you when you tell me there's like a problem with the world, so I'm going
8950540	8952780	to say, do you vote? Did you vote?
8952820	8956700	Well, and the other thing too, like, not this, not to like play down
8956700	8962140	anything. I think there's these issues are out there. They've been
8962140	8965900	always out there. It's just now it's more prevalent because of social
8965900	8970420	media. Like I wouldn't say, I'm not going to say that all of the game
8970420	8973380	companies and all the games beforehand, all the teams that have worked
8973380	8978060	on, they've been squeaky clean and we should, we avoid games based on
8978060	8981820	that and like, God, now that we know, I guess as we could boycott it,
8982220	8984980	I'm just going to boycott it out of laziness just because I'm probably
8984980	8989660	not going to get around to it ever. But, um, I don't know. It's just
8989660	8994740	like, I just, it's too much for me to focus on. Why can't I just play
8994740	8995100	games?
8995180	8999100	Well, here's the thing, like, you know what, if you want to make an
8999100	9001700	informed decision and that's, you know, especially as I was seeing all
9001700	9004260	this, and then I'm telling you my honest reaction to this when I'm
9004260	9007180	seeing YYR's email, I'm like, Hmm, I wasn't really following this game.
9007180	9009820	And you know what, now I'm just not going to, you know, I've got a
9009820	9012980	million other games to play right now. I don't, you know, this one is
9012980	9016020	just like, yeah, it's not going to be something I'm going to go seek out
9016020	9019140	now. You know what I mean? That's right. And so there's nothing wrong
9019140	9022140	with making an informed decision. You choose how you want to spend
9022140	9022780	your money.
9022780	9025580	Besides, there's the other one that was, uh, it's not hat in time.
9025580	9030500	There's one that's, uh, freeze me. That's also another like 3d
9030500	9034580	platform again. That's pretty good. Okay. So we'll pick a freeze me
9034580	9035100	instead.
9035140	9040660	Yeah. All right. Anyhow. Uh, moving on. It just sucks that we, I live
9040660	9043500	in this constant fear of like, what I just said is going to get me
9043500	9046460	canceled. You know what I mean? Like, that's just the, like the
9046460	9046940	society.
9047100	9051260	Let's check with the higher ups on the board. Nope, we got no board.
9051300	9056180	What happened to just, what happened to just educating? What happened to
9056180	9056900	learning?
9057500	9060540	Well, didn't you know this current administration things learning is
9060540	9066300	bad. Science facts bad. Anyway, I'm not, I know I do. I just want to
9066300	9069900	make it very clear. I totally respect the email and I do. I appreciate
9069900	9073260	the informed decision because like I said, now I know, Oh, this is a
9073260	9076020	game. Just, it wasn't even on my radar and now it's just not going to,
9076100	9081140	there's so many games. Yeah, exactly. All right. Anyhow, moving on to a,
9081140	9086020	there was a second update from YYR that came in on September 9th
9086020	9089860	Dreamcast day that says, hello, LR. I know you probably just got done
9089860	9093020	with an email from me. Fooled you. We didn't have a show, but I'm
9093020	9095260	listening to the latest episode of the airport. I just want to clarify
9095260	9099420	something. Xbox game pass is not a streaming service. You download an
9099420	9103700	entire game to your Xbox one after which you can play it. That is the
9103700	9107460	only way game pass works. Streaming is not an available option. And at
9107460	9110500	the present time, Microsoft does not offer game streaming service for
9110500	9114180	the Xbox one. Good. Cause it sucks. I'm glad that they don't have
9114180	9118180	streaming. It should all be download. I'm down with that. I'm download
9118180	9121780	with that. The only Xbox streaming that currently exists is the ability
9121780	9125460	to stream from your Xbox one to your PC, but that's something entirely
9125460	9127940	different. Anyway, that's it. And I hope you guys have a great week.
9128740	9131460	Why am I saying fuck that stupid PlayStation now? I swear to God, I
9131460	9135620	hate that shit. If you can download games, which by the way is a rumor,
9135620	9140500	apparently that they are going to have downloadable games on the
9140500	9144180	PlayStation. Now, apparently it came up on one of the things that likes
9144180	9148900	to download this title. So that's something interesting, but I don't
9148900	9153620	know. Um, yeah, I don't know if that's going to actually become a thing
9153620	9158020	pretty soon. Okay. Uh, I, Y Y R is in chat and correctly stated. I
9158020	9160980	forgot to finish the last email cause we got on such a tangent about
9160980	9163780	cancel coach culture and all that. I forgot to finish his first email.
9163780	9166740	So let me finish the first email that said moving on to something else
9166740	9170100	in mid August, in response to the rumor that new super Mario, you was
9170100	9175620	on its way to switch, which it is spoiler alert. It is, uh, you guys
9175620	9178660	wondered why it couldn't have been super Mario maker instead spoiler
9178660	9181540	alert. It wasn't all right. All right. I'm done with that. Uh, I believe
9181540	9184740	that the answer to this is simple. New super Mario. You simply has to
9184740	9188100	come first. It's the same reason why Konami would never release a version
9188100	9191860	of DDR that lets you add your own songs. Because if they did, what
9191860	9195540	would be the point of releasing another version in the same way, if you
9195540	9198660	can create or download the levels of super Mario maker, why would you
9198660	9204340	buy new super Mario? You, uh, P chat. Should I said spoiler? Oh, I
9204340	9208100	forget. Uh, I personally trust the rumor that super Mario maker marks
9208100	9211220	the end of the 2d series for now. So to me, it makes sense to release
9211220	9215380	the final proper game before its creation tool, as opposed to after
9215380	9219460	it. Finally, I wanted to express my gratitude. I heard every mention
9219460	9222260	of super multitasking you made, Rob, and I really appreciate the
9222260	9225780	plugs. Every single one. I have so much gratitude for the fact that
9225780	9228420	you're enthusiastically recommending my work at every possible
9228420	9232900	opportunity and allow me to do so again. That was my words, not his in
9232900	9236100	the email. Allow me to do so again, super multitasking on steam. Uh, so
9236100	9239060	for that, thank you very much. You're welcome very much. But one last
9239060	9244820	thing is in no way whatsoever. Super Mario 64 overrated fight me.
9244820	9248180	Please don't actually fight me. Why we are and everybody with that
9248180	9251460	comment, super multitasking is canceled. No, I'm just kidding. Of
9251460	9254580	course. I'm kidding. Of course. I'm getting everyone's welcome to
9254580	9258420	their own opinion. All right. There we go. That's it for emails tonight.
9258420	9261140	Thank you so much to all our emails. If you want to send us an email for
9261140	9264900	a future week, participate at orange lounge, radio.com. But in the
9264900	9269860	meanwhile, we have some more stories to get into, right? Loki. Yes.
9269860	9275780	Let's let's talk about some stories, including this ridiculous video
9275780	9281460	coming from Microsoft talking about the Xbox one limited edition
9281460	9286180	grease poof controller that has to do with, of course, pub G because,
9286180	9290980	you know, winner, winner, chicken dinner. Apparently it is covered
9290980	9295620	with a impervious degrees urethane coating, and it's going to be a
9295620	9299780	limited run. These gray and yellow controllers that are going to be
9299780	9305460	available. Apparently the I don't know if this was for a certain
9305460	9307780	region. It looks like it had something to do with the Australia,
9307780	9312180	New Zealand. It was announced on the Xbox and the Australia,
9312180	9315140	New Zealand Facebook page. And they were having some, I think,
9315140	9321700	contests in regards to the launch of the game. They're basically
9321700	9326020	saying, I guess you have to submit an anecdote about how Greece has
9326020	9330340	ruined your gaming experience or something like that. So neat.
9330340	9332900	I think those controllers, they should just cover all of the
9332900	9338580	controllers with that so that Greece doesn't because gamer hands and
9338580	9342340	not necessarily gamer hands, but kid hands. Holy fuck. Are they like
9342340	9347380	just nasty shit? I mean, like I my switch right now is fucking
9347380	9351380	disgusting. I cleaned off every now and then, but like, I don't know
9351380	9353540	what the fuck that they do those things. They touch it with their
9353540	9357460	like dirty ass hands. I know what they do. They eat, they eat food and
9357460	9361220	play games at the same time and don't wash their hands in between.
9362020	9365380	And it's a big no no. And that's how you spread disease. Like what
9365380	9368180	we were talking about earlier in the show. Well, yeah, kids are dirty.
9368180	9370820	I mean, of course, a disease like that's going to spread everywhere.
9370820	9376660	They, you know, I don't know. All right. Well, something you can play
9376660	9380340	with your grubby hands on these controllers. Actually, no, because
9380340	9383860	this is on the Nintendo Switch, but is the Sega ages classic. That's
9383860	9388020	right. Sonic is continuing the Sega ages series. They were announced
9388020	9391700	in Famitsu magazine in Japan this week. Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Space
9391700	9396340	Harrier, Columns 2, Outrun, and Thunder Force AC going to be made
9396340	9399540	available in the Sega ages collection. Columns 2, you're going to be
9399540	9403700	able to do online battle. Cool. Outrun will have an arranged soundtrack
9403700	9406420	as well as the original music. So don't worry if you're a fan of the
9406420	9410180	original. That is not going anywhere. You get both. No prices, no
9410180	9413780	confirmation. These are even coming to America. I don't see why they
9413780	9417540	wouldn't. And the Switch is region free after all. But as of now, this
9417540	9421220	is only confirmed for Japan. I don't think the direct change to any of
9421220	9424180	that or any of the subsequent news that I've seen. So anyway, that's
9424180	9428180	what's going on with Sega ages. However, I should also point out they
9428180	9433620	are actually asking fans their most wanted Sega ages game. So they're
9433620	9438340	doing a Twitter survey asking Japanese fans what their most requested
9438340	9442500	Sega age game would be. The winner will be announced at Tokyo Game
9442500	9446500	Show. And there is a Sega ages stage event on the 22nd of September. So
9446500	9451220	we're letting the internet vote on what should, yes, nothing bad ever
9451220	9456820	happened with this. Can we vote for Phantasy Star Online 2 Western
9456820	9460660	release? Can I write in that vote? Oh wait, that wouldn't work for Sega
9460660	9466260	ages. Although, wouldn't like a Phantasy Star offline be a pretty cool
9466260	9469460	thing? I guess that really wouldn't work. I'm just making shit up at this
9469460	9474900	point. But yeah. Yeah, sg100matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
9475940	9478820	Never let the internet vote. Nothing good will come from it. Yeah, that's
9478820	9481540	kind of where I was going with this. To which Bobby Blackwell follows up
9481540	9488420	with Phantasy Star Online, McPhantasy Star Online face. Yes, that.
9488420	9492100	Of course the vote. I mean, I understand Sega ages were like classic
9492100	9496660	arcade games, but most of the arcade games are classics now. Yeah. So
9496660	9504180	clearly the vote has to be for Daytona. It has to be Daytona.
9504180	9509940	Uh, can I vote for Samba de Amigo with the, with the joy con controllers
9509940	9515940	as the Sambas? That could work. Right. Uh, anyway, uh, some other folks
9516020	9521060	in chatter saying Gunstar Heroes. Yawn. You already got Gunstar Heroes
9521060	9525860	on virtual console enough. You know why? And it's been released on other
9525860	9529700	platforms. It's time for more Daytona. So what if it's like one of the
9529700	9536100	greatest Genesis games always over? Get that later. It's Daytona. Samba de
9536100	9542340	Amigo, Daytona. Both at the same time. Let's move on. Loki. Fighters, mega
9542420	9546180	mix with all the, like, you know, we'll get all of the characters in
9546180	9552900	there and brawl it. Yeah. Anyways. Um, so Epic has dropped video
9552900	9557780	capture off of the switch version of Fortnite because of performance
9557780	9561220	issues. First off, I was surprised that there was even video capture at
9561220	9565380	all on Fortnite on the switch, but apparently it was a thing at one
9565380	9569140	time, but apparently it's been affecting the guest gameplay. And so
9569140	9572980	because of that, they have patched it out and says, you may have noticed
9572980	9577060	we've disabled video capture feature on Nintendo switch as of version
9577060	9583300	5.4 0.2, a client update. This was done for performance and stability
9583300	9587540	reasons. As we've been seeing a high rate of out of memory related
9587540	9592340	crashes disabling this feature saves a significant amount of Ram while
9592340	9595060	also having the positive effect on the overall performance across the
9595060	9598180	board. Yeah, I think that's fine. Maybe this is why Nintendo didn't
9598180	9601860	want to talk about Fortnite at their direct. Who knows? I'm teasing a
9601860	9606100	little bit. The fact that they had video capture in there and voice
9606100	9610180	chat is pretty fucking impressive considering that hello Nintendo.
9610180	9614340	Why does Splatoon not have voice chat built in without using a fucking
9614340	9618740	app? Maybe now we know it's, it's got to have some power and you know,
9618740	9623140	you're just using too much power to actually come on. Splatoon is not
9623140	9626260	that much more of a graphically intensive game than Fortnite, please.
9626580	9630180	All right. Uh, Bobby Black Wolf does point out, well, the video capture
9630180	9633700	was using the switches native video capture feature, but you know, isn't
9633700	9636820	that still a certain amount of Ram in the background that's being taken
9636820	9641220	up? Oh, interesting. All right. Anyhow, uh, let's move on to another
9641220	9644420	story. This was actually, uh, suggested in our discord. So if you're
9644420	9647780	not on our discord server, you should join vog network.com slash
9647780	9650900	discord. We'll get you an invite. And there's an orange lounge radio
9650900	9656020	channel where this story was passed on about a potential unannounced
9656100	9660580	project from Blizzard. So this is kind of rumor-y, but there is some
9660580	9664020	proof. There are some receipts behind this rumor. Uh, and it's from
9664020	9668500	looking at the Blizzard job site, Blizzard careers. Uh, we know a lot
9668500	9671220	of Diablo stuff is in the works right now. Gee, I wonder what could
9671220	9673860	be going on. Maybe we'll find out at Blizzcon. It's either an
9673860	9677460	expansion or, or the number four might be seen. Who knows? Who knows?
9677460	9682180	But anyway, Blizzard also has an unannounced project for people that
9682180	9687220	want to build an action packed game with a beautiful visceral core
9687220	9691380	combat experience. Uh, the person applying should have a passion for
9691380	9696740	co-op games, RPGs, and board games. Uh, they're hiring things like art
9696740	9698980	director, character, artists, environment, armist, gameplay
9698980	9703460	engineer, and a lead senior level designer position where you can
9703460	9706820	actually get some bullet points as to what they're doing, including
9707860	9711140	own level design and world building from conception to the final stages
9711140	9714740	of polish facilitating communication and coordinating team members to
9714740	9718420	ensure the vision is clearly defined and understood. Um, let's see, I'm
9718420	9722660	not trying not to read like all of these, but, uh, let's see partnered
9722660	9725380	with engineering to define and create tooling that effectively
9725380	9730180	compliments Blizzard's world class handcrafted level design. Uh, so
9730180	9734180	anyway, uh, some other things that I guess are in the job listings that
9734180	9739300	are interesting next gen AI, like motion capture systems, a robust
9739300	9744100	first person engine for the game and a unique visual direction. So what
9744100	9748980	could this be? Some people speculating it could be a Blizzard's
9748980	9754740	answer to, and here's what Blizzard does very well. They take popular
9754740	9759060	game genres and make them stupid easily accessible. They've done it
9759060	9762420	with trading card games, Hearthstone. They've done it with EverQuest,
9762420	9765620	World of Warcraft. They've done it with, you know, they've done it with
9765700	9770260	other stuff. So what do you think Blizzard might be tackling now? And
9770260	9776020	some people say it is no, not battle royale. This could be Blizzard's
9776020	9780180	battle royale project. What do you think? Stop jumping on that train.
9780180	9784100	It's I think it's already gone. You know, what's interesting. Be an
9784100	9788660	innovator, not like a copier. I remember, I don't know how I remember
9788660	9794900	this, but I remember on a hoard house a long time ago, there was rumors
9794900	9798740	that Titan, which as we know became Overwatch, essentially Titan was
9798740	9802340	canceled. And from the grave of the assets and things like that, that's
9802340	9806100	where Overwatch came from. I think Overwatch, the battling was supposed
9806100	9810980	to be like once part of the Titan game. But anyway, my point is I
9810980	9814340	remember one of the early rumors about Titan. What is that was that it
9814340	9818740	was a James Bond-esque spy game. It was a spy versus spy type of game as
9818740	9825300	Nespionage spy type of game. I mean, Team Fortress 2? I don't know.
9825300	9829780	Could this be like a James Bond-y spy type of game? I think that'd be
9829780	9832500	because, you know, when I hear like first person, I think, well, they
9832500	9835620	kind of already have that with Overwatch. This is going to have to be
9835620	9839460	different than Overwatch. So either it's, you know, battle royale-esque
9839460	9841780	or it's, you know, something, you know, simply something we haven't seen yet.
9841780	9848340	Overwatch 2. It feels early for that. Overwatch, it still feels early to
9848340	9852660	say Overwatch 2 because, I mean, I still think if they're going to do
9852660	9856740	Overwatch expansions, it's going to be single player because like,
9856740	9859380	they're still pumping heroes out there. They've still got, still got
9859380	9862740	Overwatch League is a big thing. And you know, that's all kind of built
9862740	9865780	into the base Overwatch game. So I'm not sure Blizzard suddenly wants
9865780	9869060	to put out Overwatch 2 and disrupt all of that. That doesn't make sense.
9869060	9873860	I feel like this really is some type of new type of project. So I don't
9873860	9879140	know. Kaijuto says in chat, Overwatch isn't a spy game at all. I know.
9879140	9881220	That's my point. Maybe this is.
9884020	9886980	ActDeft in chat says, please give us a fucking single player campaign,
9886980	9889700	Blizzard. Could be. I mean, that might be why you would need to design
9889700	9893220	levels and so forth. Maybe Overwatch is going to go with a single player
9893220	9898500	expansion. Who knows? I don't know. Anyway, we'll find out maybe at
9898500	9901540	BlizzCon or we might have to wait another year because Blizzard is very
9901540	9904660	good at keeping things in the oven until they are very, very, very done.
9905380	9909140	Kaijuto in chat does say though, I want a battle royale espionage game.
9909140	9913220	I think, yeah, I kind of think it's tie the spy versus spy, James Bond,
9913220	9917700	GoldenEye 64, but with battle royale. I think, I don't know. That might be
9917700	9922740	kind of rad. We'll see. Everyone's wanting Agent, which is that game
9922740	9927620	that was supposed to be. Oh yeah. Rockstar stuff. Oh yeah. I remember
9927620	9930180	that. I remember that. All right. Anyway, a few more stories for you
9930260	9933380	guys. Then we're going to get to the Skype line for a little bit tonight.
9933380	9936180	If you do want to call in though, I encourage you to get in relatively
9936180	9939300	quick because, um, I'm not going to keep it open all night cause the
9939300	9942020	show's already running a little long. So, but we got some stories to get
9942020	9946260	to before we get there. So first Loki. All right. Let's talk about
9946260	9951860	uncensored sex. Yes. A hundred percent uncensored sex games.
9952980	9959060	Loki, I like you, but I don't like you. So, um, you know, you may remember
9959060	9962580	there was a whole like controversy with steam and pulling down games
9962580	9965940	off of their service that were like these visual novels and stuff. And
9965940	9968420	then they were like, no, no, no, we're not trying to ban anything like
9968420	9971620	that. We just don't want people to see anime titty. So now apparently
9971620	9975540	they are, they have approved the first a hundred percent, um, uncensored
9975540	9984260	game called negligee. And, um, and it is out now, uh, for people to
9984260	9991620	check out, but there is one small problem. Apparently the, um, you know,
9991620	9995940	the content, some in some countries it would be considered possibly
9995940	10001780	illegal. So they have to ban it from certain, um, regions. So for
10001780	10007540	example, Belgium, Japan, Malaysia, Botswana, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria,
10007540	10013380	South Africa, Sudan, Uganda, Bangladesh, China, Lebanon, South Korea,
10013380	10019220	Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, um, Belarus, Iceland, Ukraine,
10019220	10025220	Russia, Australia, Australia, man, uh, Papua New Guinea, um, Guyana,
10025780	10030980	Iraq, Dubai, UAE, and Germany are not going to be able to check out this
10030980	10037700	game. And that's made people sad. Well, I mean, they can always pirate
10037700	10040980	it. No, I'm just, I'm not going to endorse that, but I just feel like
10041060	10044100	that's what's going to happen when you ban something that people will
10044100	10049220	find a way to get their anime titty. They will. So I'm just being a
10049220	10053220	realist here. People just be, are you interested in a 100% uncensored
10053220	10056020	sex games on steam? Are you, are you gonna buy negligee? I don't like
10056020	10059700	visual novel games. So probably not, probably not, not enough action
10059700	10063380	for you. All right. Well, maybe this will be more up your alley.
10064340	10070340	Uh, they are making a game out of the novel series. Goosebumps. You know
10070340	10076980	what? You know what the Goosebumps books are, right? I think those have
10076980	10080820	been around since like we were in high school and that age. Uh, but
10080820	10085380	anyway, Goosebumps the game is on its way on the Nintendo switch. It's
10085380	10090020	going to be launching on October 9th from way forward. And that's a way
10090020	10093220	forward has been putting out some quality shit. So, uh, this actually
10093220	10097540	might be pretty rad. Uh, this action game was originally released in 2015
10097540	10101620	as a prequel to the Goosebumps film. Uh, in the game, you are in the
10101620	10103940	car- you're in the shoes of a character whose neighborhood has been
10103940	10108580	overrun by R.L. Stine's monsters from the Goosebumps series. You have
10108580	10112660	to outsmart and use your wits to investigate, uh, the clues and the
10112660	10117300	surroundings and figure it all out before it's too late and you get
10117300	10120580	eaten by a grew. Oh, wait, that was his org game. But anyway, that is,
10120580	10125060	uh, all on its way. So, um, check that out on Nintendo switch, October
10125060	10131060	9th. Anyhow, let's get to the calls. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word
10131060	10134420	on Skype. If you want to give us a call and talk about, uh, anything
10134420	10137940	maybe we have or have not gotten to yet on the program tonight,
10137940	10140820	especially since we've been gone for a little bit, maybe you have
10140820	10143860	something you wanted to ask us that we missed from the past couple
10143860	10146580	weeks. Uh, do we have any, uh, other last minute stories?
10146580	10150580	Yes, this is coming from Twitter from Stanley Tucci Mane. And this is
10150580	10155060	basically talking about a Silent Hill Enhanced Edition that fans have
10155060	10159860	made, because if you may remember, the Silent Hill HD collection sucked.
10160500	10165460	So the Silent Hill 2 Enhanced Edition is basically a bunch of
10165460	10170020	modifications to the PC version of the game that fixed a lot of the
10170020	10173700	issues. It adds widescreen support, a higher resolution display,
10174500	10178980	removal of audio bugs, PlayStation 2 quality audio and fog, better
10178980	10183940	controller support, and lots more. So you can go check it out.
10184500	10187940	That's pretty cool. Um, again, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype. I saw a
10187940	10190580	call come in and I just missed it because I was, um, looking at
10190580	10193220	Loki when he was talking about this. If you were, um, looking forward
10193220	10200260	to that mod, that's enhanced.townofsilenthill.com slash SH2. So go
10200260	10204260	check it out there. Okay. Uh, we have a call coming in. Let's get to it.
10204260	10207780	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Hello, it's YYR.
10207780	10209380	Haven't we heard enough from you already?
10210180	10212260	No, I have more grievances. Sorry.
10212260	10214260	Fine. Uh, what else shall we hear about?
10215940	10218020	Okay. Well, let me begin the airing then.
10218020	10218660	All right.
10218660	10223860	Wait, hold on. There's a lot. No, no, just kidding. Um, actually I'm
10223860	10229860	going to refer to something that you said during your call with Bobby
10229860	10236180	on his show last week. Um, and that was when you mentioned Beat Saber
10236180	10240260	and you were talking about, um, how, you know, people have just
10240260	10244820	put in these stupid hard charts and things like that. Um, you
10244820	10248180	mentioned that, uh, that's also kind of part of the reason that
10248180	10252260	you're turned off by new DDR, uh, because there's been such an
10252260	10255700	emphasis on these high level charts and that's just really not your
10255700	10261060	scene. Right. And, uh, well, I'm just going to mention, I mean, the,
10261700	10265380	as it is, yes, they are adding a few new hard things to the game
10265380	10270580	here and there, but despite that, the majority of new charts being
10270580	10275060	added to the game are still in the 13 and below range, which is like
10275060	10282260	easy nines, uh, on the old, uh, scale. So there is still a lot of.
10282260	10286100	Maybe these scale updates have got me all thrown off because you say
10286100	10291540	13 and I go, that's very, I can only do a nine. What do you mean a 13
10291540	10292740	is an easy song?
10293540	10296580	No, on the new scale max 300 is a 15.
10296580	10301140	Oh, wow. Okay. All right. Well, and that's, let's be max 300 was like
10301140	10305620	the original ridiculous song. Look, I'm not trying to knock the
10305620	10308900	people that are into that. And I hope that's coming through, but I
10308900	10311860	hope people kind of understand that it's like when you're a dirty
10311860	10315620	casual like me, which is an okay thing to be, you could be a fan of
10315620	10320420	DDR and not like, you know, have the stamina to crank out these
10320740	10324900	level 15 songs and all this stuff. I've been playing every single
10324900	10329540	day, almost every single day for at least 30 to 60 minutes a day.
10329540	10331620	And I still don't have the stamina to do, but then again, I play
10331620	10332120	doubles. So.
10332980	10337540	Wow. You should do max 300 on doubles. Yeah, exactly. Stupid
10337540	10340020	noob. That's cause I don't use the bar.
10341940	10347940	Okay. So I'll mention this with regard to that. Um, I do, uh, play
10347940	10352740	double. So, and yeah, I play max 300 on double occasionally
10352740	10355860	too. And to make up for the fact that you have to use both
10355860	10359460	sides, the actual step chart is a little less dense than the
10359460	10363780	single version. So, but I do hold the bar for it, you know, one
10363780	10367140	hand on each bar. Oh my gosh. It's like doing the splits.
10368100	10374980	Um, you do. Okay. So DDR prohibits, uh, what in the groove
10374980	10379460	calls stretch jumps. That's things like, uh, the left arrow
10379460	10382900	on one player side and the right arrow on two player side.
10382900	10387300	Yeah. I think the, the furthest you can, the furthest DDR gives
10387300	10391860	you is stuff like right on the one player side and up or down
10391860	10394900	on the two player side. Like you won't even see right on both
10394900	10397860	sides. It, it will not give you that. So don't worry about
10397860	10401860	down, down sometimes or up, up. Yeah. I feel like I've seen him
10401860	10409620	do up, up 3d is, uh, the, uh, the standard steps have down,
10409620	10414660	down, I believe, or they're probably isolated jumps and not
10414660	10417300	like right after other notes. Like they're not coming at you
10417300	10420260	as fast as they are in other songs. Like jumps like that are
10420260	10422340	okay when they're like spaced out. You know what I mean?
10423620	10427060	Yeah. I don't remember seeing that in DDR, but, uh, yeah, it's
10427060	10430580	a, it's uncommon. Yeah. In the groove though, they just throw
10430580	10433620	all kinds of crazy stuff in there because it's in the group
10433620	10437060	because in the group fans are crazy. Yeah. I'm not starting
10437060	10440820	that war again. I'm just teasing. I'm teasing. But yeah,
10440820	10444260	absolutely. And, and nobody in the community from the, you
10444260	10447140	know, the beginners all the way up through the super world-class
10447140	10450900	experts, nobody looks down on people playing easier stuff.
10450900	10454100	Everyone plays what they like and, uh, it's very, uh, it's a
10454100	10458660	very positive community and, uh, yeah. That's good. Stay
10458660	10461220	positive. And like I mentioned before, you know, so one reason
10461220	10463060	I kind of like all the easy stuff and yeah, you know, I know
10463060	10465300	a lot of songs have easy stuff, but I feel like, I feel like a
10465300	10467460	lot of the stuff I see online is just like all the hard stuff,
10467460	10469220	but I guess that's just, you know, people want to brag about
10469220	10471700	their accomplishments and all, which is cool. But I think part
10471700	10473540	of the reason I like the freestyle stuff is like, oh,
10473540	10476020	it's like the easy, but it has finesse. And that's kind of what
10476020	10478340	I was saying, kind of the point I was trying to make with the
10478340	10481220	beat, beat saber stuff was that it's like, wow, somebody's like
10481220	10484420	kind of figured out a way to like grade freestyle sort of,
10484420	10488180	which was something that was so, you know, opinion based
10488180	10491780	before. It's like now beat saber kind of brings both those
10491780	10494980	worlds together, if that makes sense. Yeah. It's kind of neat.
10494980	10497380	And when, when I heard your comment about the scoring
10497380	10500820	system and, uh, you know, that it takes your movements and
10500820	10504420	your finesse into account, I don't know. I think I, I actually
10504420	10506820	kind of liked that because it's something different. Yeah.
10506820	10510500	Something different, you know, at the end of the day, how many
10510500	10513860	of us are really playing for score? I mean, I'm sure, I'm
10513860	10515620	sure there's a lot of hardcore music fans. There's gonna be
10515620	10517460	people raising their hand here and there. They're saying me,
10517460	10519300	me, but I bet there's a lot of people that are going to play
10519300	10522740	beat saber just because they just want to play the beat, be
10522740	10526180	in the experience. They want to ride the ride. You know what I
10526180	10531300	mean? Yeah. Well, I mean, I, I played DDR for score actually.
10531300	10534900	But I think, I think with DDR, even there's a lot of people
10534900	10537940	that are like, oh, cool. Yeah. DDR is cool. I like that game.
10537940	10540260	But they just, when they say that it's like, they, they hop
10540260	10542980	on the machine occasionally and play it. And that that's really
10542980	10545060	it. You know what I mean? Like, and they, there's nothing wrong
10545060	10548660	with that. There's nothing wrong with that. But next time
10548660	10552980	you play Ace, I definitely would encourage you to, you know,
10552980	10556740	don't just go into the, you know, the extreme folder, the
10556740	10561460	Max 2 folder or what have you. But keep, keep holding down that
10561460	10566340	up or down button and go to the level sort feature. It's very
10566340	10568820	easy to find. You don't have to press any special button
10568820	10572260	combination to find it. Go to the level sort. Yeah, because I
10572260	10576980	do that pop in music. Yeah. And, and go, go ahead and find,
10576980	10580500	you know, and, and what's really neat about DDR Ace is let's say
10580500	10584340	you go to level sort 10. So it shows you all the tens, but it
10584340	10587620	doesn't just show you the expert tens or the difficult tens. It
10587620	10591380	shows you all the tens across all the difficulties. Yeah. No,
10591380	10593860	I like that. BeatMania 2DX does that too, which I really like.
10595060	10597860	So, but yeah, and you'll find a lot of new songs that way and
10597860	10599940	you'll get to play at your level and everything is good,
10599940	10603220	except for when they give a chart the wrong difficulty,
10603220	10606260	which unfortunately happens a lot, but whatever. Honestly,
10606260	10609220	why are though the real answer is instead of going straight to
10609220	10611380	the difficulty store, what I usually do is I go straight to
10611380	10616420	Ariana Grande. Can't help it. Can't help it. That song is a
10616420	10620180	banger. It is. Even if it's like, even if there's like, I
10620180	10622740	would much prefer if Into You was the song that was in DDR,
10622740	10624420	but that's okay. You know what? We can't, we can't own them
10624420	10628980	all. All right. It's funny. I actually found an ITG chart for
10628980	10633300	that and it's a remix of the song that's just amazing, but
10633300	10639060	the chart is really tricky. So it's like, Oh man. But before I
10639060	10641380	go, I just want to address something I saw in chat from
10641380	10645300	Dark Tetsuya. You know, DDR is 20 years old this month. And
10645300	10649620	what's really interesting is that they did not update DDR
10649620	10654660	Ace for like a period of five to six months. And then a few
10654660	10657780	months ago, they started just throwing all these new songs
10657780	10661060	into the game. And finally, they just dropped a massive
10661060	10664340	update like a few weeks ago. And a lot of us in the community
10664340	10667860	are starting to think that this is ramping up to a new game
10667860	10671140	announcement like any day now. Ooh, that would be fun.
10672340	10676260	Especially to commemorate the anniversary. Yeah, exactly. And
10676260	10679300	so, you know, and because, you know, earlier in the year, they
10679300	10681940	launched Dance Rush Stardom, which hopefully you've had the
10681940	10683780	chance to play because it's really fun. No, we should bring
10683780	10686420	that to Dave and Buster's because... No, I haven't played
10687060	10689860	over here. I've been since... I almost went to round... Okay,
10689860	10693140	here's... You're gonna laugh YYR. So I almost went to round
10693140	10695380	one over the weekend because I was hanging out with my buddy
10695380	10698660	JD and we were talking. He's as into the music games as you
10698660	10702020	are. So... Yeah, I know. I played DDR with him when I was in
10702020	10705860	San Fran a while back. We were talking about going to round
10705860	10709380	one because he doesn't really have a car. So, you know, it's
10709380	10711540	hard, a little harder for him to get to round one. But you
10711540	10714420	know what? YYR, what ended up happening? We went to Drag
10714500	10719140	Queen Brunch instead. I'm sure that was definitely
10719140	10721860	entertaining in its own way. It was because the drag queen
10721860	10727860	performed Ariana Grande. So, I still got my fix. So, all
10727860	10730340	right. Anyway, my friend Emily, go to try to get some more
10730340	10733380	calls. But take care, okay? Hey, have a great week. Thanks.
10733380	10737380	You too. Bye-bye. Take care. Bye. All right. Orange Lounge
10737380	10739780	Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.
10739780	10743220	Yeah, true story. Went to Drag Queen Brunch. They just opened
10743220	10745700	a Hamburger Mary's in San Francisco which is funny
10745700	10747860	because that, yeah, I think they used to have one there
10747860	10749620	years ago and then it closed. Now, they have a brand new
10749620	10752260	one. They do that kind of stuff there. So, you know, good
10752260	10758100	times. Good times. Good way to have a really, oh, I tried to
10758100	10761140	pick up that call and it immediately hung up. That's not
10761140	10764900	good. Alright, we'll see if we can get one more call in here
10764900	10768020	well before we close up shop for the night. Let's get to it
10768020	10771380	higher on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Oh my god, Rob.
10772100	10775780	Hi. How you doing, Rageinator? What's up? Good. How are you?
10775780	10780260	Good. What's on your mind? Well, two, two things. They're
10780260	10783780	kind of sort of related. Sorry, I really haven't been around
10783780	10786500	too much for the live shows. Unfortunately, real life is
10786500	10788740	kind of going in the way. That's okay. We haven't really
10788740	10793220	been around either. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I usually try to make a
10793220	10795860	habit of, you know, being around for live shows and all
10795860	10799140	that. You know, you know, you know, it's been a kind of a
10799140	10805780	habit of mine for... Me too. What, ten years plus? But
10805780	10812580	anyway, you know, as it relates, you know, to that, you
10812580	10818980	know, there's someone very close to me that's into gaming
10818980	10822740	that just, you know, started seeing relatively recently.
10822740	10826740	She's into horror games predominantly. Oh boy.
10830420	10833860	Now, she, you know, she already has Dead by Daylight and
10833860	10837780	Resident Evil 7, which I gifted her, and she has already
10837780	10843380	played the Fear series and she plays all her games through
10843380	10850980	Steam. Now, that being said, what horror games can you name
10850980	10855140	off the bat, aside from the ones that are listed, would,
10855140	10859620	you know, would you recommend? Rageinator, it's like the
10859620	10864260	genre that I play the least because the scares are too much
10864260	10867620	for me. Although, I mean, certainly, if she is not playing
10867620	10870180	the Five Nights at Freddy's series, those games are
10870180	10873060	insanely popular, although some people don't like the jump
10873060	10876500	scares. I remember a game from a few years ago called
10876500	10880660	Slender Man that people really liked to see me play on Twitch
10880660	10885220	because when I would get scared the hell out of, it was
10885220	10889620	always a good time. I liked the Friday the 13th game that they
10889620	10893460	did, but I kind of think Dead by Daylight kind of took all
10893460	10896740	those because it's a very, very similar type of game. I think
10896740	10899460	it kind of already took those people away because then
10899460	10902020	Friday the 13th ran into all these problems where suddenly
10902020	10904340	like the movie licensing was an issue and all this stuff. So, I
10904340	10907140	think that game is kind of like kind of like dropped off really
10907140	10909460	fast and I think most of those people went over to Dead by
10909460	10911860	Daylight, but I enjoyed the Friday the 13th game. So, if
10911860	10914420	she's never played it, I would think that's one. But you know
10914420	10919220	what? I'm gonna say go for the gate because these are the ones
10919220	10921700	I'm more into instead of like the jump scares and things like
10921700	10924100	that. Go into the things that are really like the
10924100	10927780	psychological horrors. Is Silent Hill available on Steam?
10927780	10930100	Because that's gonna be serious. I'm always gonna. I don't think
10930100	10934260	so. I mean, if they are on Steam, I sure as hell haven't
10934260	10937940	seen them. Hmm. Well, look for it and see if it's there because
10937940	10941460	that would be an absolute recommend for me and then what
10941460	10943540	was I also gonna say as far as like the story. Silent Hill
10943540	10947780	Homecoming is. It's not the best but it's not. You could do
10947780	10952260	a lot worse. We just talked about Alan Wake earlier. Is
10952260	10954660	Alan Wake still available on Steam or is it? I think that was
10954660	10959780	still. The original game? No. American Nightmare? Yes. Oh,
10959780	10961780	that's weird. The original game is not. That's the one I would
10961780	10965380	have recommended because that's more the psychological thing I
10965380	10968020	would have said. Okay, so. Yeah, I think I think it has to
10968020	10972340	do with music licensing but I could be wrong. Okay. So, the
10972340	10976260	chat room always helping me out when I cannot help. Uh Pooba
10976260	10980180	has a bunch of answers here. Amnesia. Oh, **** I forgot about
10980180	10983460	the amnesia. She hasn't played Amnesia. Like, get the first
10983460	10985780	one. I mean, the later ones aren't bad but the the first
10985780	10990900	Amnesia game, holy **** That is that is one to do. Uh Pooba
10990900	10993220	also says until dawn. That's a PlayStation game though. That's
10993220	10997300	not on Steam. Trying to kind of filter this list for Steam.
10997300	10999300	Evil Within, was that a PC release or is that only
10999300	11002420	PlayStation? No, that would've been PC as well. Maybe Evil
11002420	11004500	Within. I've heard a lot of good things about that as well.
11004500	11007140	My son would recommend Bendy and the Ink Machine. That's
11007140	11011140	free. The first episode is free. Uh Alien Isolation. I
11011140	11013220	think that's a really good recommendation as well and I
11013220	11016020	know that's on Steam and I know a lot of people are really into
11016020	11018420	that. It's a different type of horror because the alien games
11018420	11023060	but I hear it is it's **** scary. Oh, alright. Alright,
11023060	11026980	well, definitely keeping all that in mind. Uh you know, in
11026980	11029540	you know, in fact, I know it's a couple of months off. I'm
11029540	11032820	trying to get a couple of ideas for her for Christmas present.
11032820	11036180	So, you know, I'll definitely mark those down. Uh you know,
11036180	11039540	on the relay note, you know, there I can't say for sure but
11039540	11044180	there's a chance that you may have run into her while at
11044180	11047140	Dragon Con. You know, I know there's there was like 80
11047140	11050100	something like 80 thousand people there. Yeah. So, trying
11050100	11053380	to find trying to find one person that is like trying to
11053380	11057460	find uh you know a hand stick but do you remember seeing
11057460	11064740	anyone in uh uh a Bioshock 2 Big Sister cosplay at all? Um
11064740	11069780	not this year. I've seen that in years past. Yeah. What about
11069780	11074740	um like a variation of uh the Powerpuff Girls uh you know
11074740	11078820	cosplay. I do remember seeing Powerpuff Girls but I'm not
11078820	11082100	gonna guarantee it was the same thing that uh yeah you know
11082100	11084500	again you you're kinda right. There's 80 thousand people.
11084500	11086980	Honestly, I think the best chance that I would have run
11086980	11089780	into her if she was at that if she's a horror game fan, she
11089780	11093380	might have been to that Five Nights at Freddy panel. Uh well
11093380	11098340	uh I don't think she was uh went to any panels at least not
11098340	11101540	that she mentioned. Uh she you know was more or less mingling
11101540	11104660	around going to various parties and whatnot. It's fine.
11104660	11107220	It's what a lot of people do. Unfortunately, I couldn't go
11107220	11111780	with her, you know, cuz kevlar expenses but. Sure. But you
11111780	11114660	know, she told me all about and you know, she told me she had a
11114660	11118020	blast so but uh anyway, I'll let you go. I've been rambling
11118020	11120660	on too long and I'm sure you wanna take some more no more
11120660	11123700	calls but I'll uh speak to you soon, right? No worries. Take
11123700	11129940	care and uh we'll see you soon. Yup. You too. Yup. Bye. I
11129940	11131780	don't know if I would have found one particular person at
11131780	11135780	Dragon Con. There's a lot of cosplays to be honest. A lot of
11135780	11139700	excellent cosplay and I've seen the full on uh not the now that
11139700	11141700	he's now that I'm thinking about it. I wasn't I'm getting
11141700	11145140	my Bioshock terms mixed up cuz I saw the I saw the big
11145140	11149460	daddies like the full on like mech **** I saw that like a
11149460	11152260	couple years ago and that was like I remember thinking like
11152260	11155780	that was some impressive **** cosplay like you know but they
11155780	11157700	have said Dragon Con has been called the Super Bowl of
11157700	11160580	cosplay and it does that for a reason because there's some
11160580	11164740	really impressive stuff there but in all honesty, this year,
11164740	11167860	I tried to stay away from a lot of that because they all hang
11167860	11174420	out at the Marriott and it's so crowded in there and like I
11174420	11178340	can do crowds to a point but like it doesn't happen to me a
11178340	11181540	lot but I had a claustrophobia moment at Dragon Con this year.
11181540	11184660	That has not happened to me since the very first Gamer X
11184660	11187780	that was in the basement of this very small hotel and like
11187780	11189700	all these panels were letting out at the same time. It got
11189700	11192580	too crowded down there and my brain just went, what if this
11192580	11195540	place caught on fire right now and I like started freaking out
11195540	11198100	so I had a moment like that at Dragon Con this year and so
11198100	11199940	that's why I just kinda try to stay away from a lot of the
11199940	11204020	crowded areas but I mean I did I not to say I like completely
11204020	11208180	avoided him cuz I remember Travis Donovan and uh his wife
11208180	11210740	really like to hang out at Polt's Bar which is like the
11210740	11213940	central for all that stuff. So I did have to wade into it a
11213940	11217780	couple times. So, um I did I did see some of that which
11217780	11219860	shout out to Travis by the way. It was really good to see him
11219860	11224980	this year as well as uh even more so his wife. Alright, uh
11224980	11227780	one last call for calls here at Orange Lounge Radio. All one
11227780	11229940	word on Skype but if we don't get anything then I think we'll
11229940	11231780	wrap things up but anything else you wanted to do uh
11231780	11234580	mention Loki? No. Can we get out of here for the night? Uh
11234580	11237460	it's been it's been a long time since we've done a show. So,
11237460	11240180	I'm. Yes. Really glad we were back tonight. So, alright.
11240500	11245860	Well, let me oh uh Rage Nator just posted a picture. So, I'm
11245860	11248740	gonna take a look right now at that picture. I mean, I'm
11248740	11250900	probably not going to remember it but let's see. You never
11250900	11254420	know. Oh, that's a really good cosplay for what it's worth.
11254420	11260900	Damn. Is that your friend? Okay. So, like uh again, it's a
11260900	11263380	radio show. So, I'm having a hard time. It's it's a they
11263380	11265620	took the picture in front of the oh they must have done this
11265620	11268580	at the Georgia Aquarium on Thursday cuz they actually so
11268580	11270900	they actually have a picture in front of all these fish to
11270900	11272820	make it look like it's underwater and it's it's uh
11272820	11275540	it's really well done. So, I mean, props on the cosplay.
11275540	11277460	That's. Scared all the kids at the aquarium. Yeah, scare
11277460	11280260	everybody there. That's uh pretty good. Alright. Well, no
11280260	11282260	other calls are coming in. So, I think we're gonna close up
11282260	11284020	the Skype line but I will say if you didn't get through
11284020	11286500	tonight but you do wanna say something, you can get to us on
11286500	11289460	Discord. You can uh send us a Twitter message or any of that
11289460	11292820	stuff. All of that would work very well and um yeah,
11292820	11295460	participate at Orange Andrade.com to send us an email.
11295460	11300260	So, um anyway, I did wanna say uh a big thanks uh to everybody
11300260	11302500	for being here especially after we've been off for a couple
11302500	11304900	weeks. I know it can throw off your rhythm. So, thank you so
11304900	11307140	much for uh finding us again or maybe you found us for the
11307140	11309300	first time. Uh thanks for being with us here on Orange
11309300	11312500	Andradeo. Uh we don't uh ask for money uh here at Orange
11312500	11315140	Andradeo. All we ask is that you spread the word. Help
11315140	11318020	tell a friend or two or five about the show. Help us spread
11318020	11319940	the word because we are the show where every gamer has a
11319940	11323300	voice but only if the voices are here to air their
11323300	11327140	grievances uh as YY did earlier in the program. Uh so
11327140	11331380	anyway, um a nice five-star review on iTunes or Google Play
11331380	11334100	wherever you found this show. Uh the that all goes a very
11334100	11337220	long way as well. We really appreciate all that. So, I think
11337220	11339940	on that note, we're gonna wrap things up. Uh Loki, your final
11339940	11344260	thought. My final thought is go play old school musical. It's
11344260	11348340	pretty fun. My final thought is I will. There you go. Alright,
11348340	11351460	done deal. My final thought is I hope my internet gets fixed
11351460	11354420	cuz I miss streaming on Twitch but at least I'm starting to
11354420	11356740	get creative and think of workarounds but it's gonna be
11356740	11358900	very hard to move this show to Twitch if we can't stream on
11358900	11361780	Twitch but I guess we could always just do a low bit rate.
11361780	11366340	I didn't say the video would have to be HD quality. Alright.
11366340	11369300	Uh but that's really it. We're done for the night and we'll
