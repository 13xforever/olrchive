7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Orange Lounge Radio. It feels so good to say that. Episode number 744 for this September 16th of 2018.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined of course here in studio. We're based in Sacramento, California.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The one and only, Techmaster Loki.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hello.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hello, hello. Good to have you back.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, good to be back.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's good to be back. It's been a couple weeks, as mentioned in the intro.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And by the way, of course, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers, she is on a planned leave due to her day job.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
She'll be joining us through the magic of a radio a little later on in the show in a pre-taped segment.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So, but as far as being in the now is concerned, we were always going to be off two weeks ago because I was at DragonCon.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Which, by the way, my god, DragonCon at this point feels like it was six months ago, okay?

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I mean, it just, it feels like it was an eternity, but I had a fantastic, wonderful, amazing time at DragonCon.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It really was like my best year yet in many ways. I'll talk a little more about that in a minute.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So I knew I was going to be off for that show and that was Labor Day anyway.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But then we unexpectedly missed last week and things happen, you guys.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What happened is that, and I'll just kind of give you disclosure, it actually was not Loki or myself or DarkSakura that was sick.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It was actually Alan, my husband, who lives here as well.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And he, I think it's okay that I disclose this. It is a little, it's a little crazy, y'all.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He had a disease called hand foot mouth disease, which is something that usually children get.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't think folks above five years old.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That is not necessarily true.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes. So adults can get it too. But the weird thing is, and what's stumping all the doctors, is that they couldn't figure out how he got it.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Because he's not around kids. We don't have kids.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So here's the thing. The doctor thinks he got it from food because he was eating out all the time while I was out at DragonCon.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And it started to settle in about the Wednesday.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Kids are everywhere.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah, I know. It's crazy, right? So that's, I mean, that's what it was.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He's fine now and he's not here anyway.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But, and honestly, could we have done the show last week?

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Probably, but I did not want to take the risk because since it is a kid disease, I did not want Loki to get it. He's had it before.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I've already had it, yeah.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Well, I didn't want you to get the cooties and then give it to your kids. That's what I really didn't want to happen.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Well, my son's had it. My oldest son had it and I got it from him. And it's not fun because you get blisters all over your hands.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's like chicken pox, but worse.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I've never had chicken pox, so.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh, I hope you've had the vaccine because that's, that's tough.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I haven't had the vaccine either. I've lived dangerously, but no.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You should talk to your doctor about that.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Uh, I've had the, um, disease. So yeah, basically I got blisters all over my hands and my feet.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
No DDR when you have that.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No, and it was hard to play games. I still played games, but it was hard because like it was uncomfortable a little bit.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But then eventually they go away.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, and that's where he's at now. They went away.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
They get like a fever, I guess, for like a day and then it just, it's just all blisters and that's it.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And so the crazy, I never got it and we live together and you know, we're married.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Well, my wife never got it and my youngest son never got it.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah, it's weird. So, and we, I don't know if it's because maybe I had it as a kid and I just don't know.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I know I had chicken pox, but I don't, I don't know about, I mean, I would have been too young to remember anyway.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But anyway, this isn't the disease and infectious podcast, it's a video game podcast.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But I wanted to give you guys a reason why we've been away for two weeks.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And also, you know, coming on the heels of Dragon Con, you know that I've done a lot of work and I'm very thankful to be included with the Dragon Con podcasting track,

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
which by the way, they're going to have a brand new name next year.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's now the Dragon Con Digital Media Creation Track or DMC.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Devil may cry. No, but it's Digital Media Creation Track.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So I've been involved with them for a long time.

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So every time I come back from Dragon Con, I'm like so motivated to like broadcast and like, I need to start three more podcasts and let's revive a podcast I did 10 years ago and all that stuff.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Like that's, that's what happens to me when I come back from Dragon Con.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And then I had a Twitch 101 panel and that went really well.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And I was like, I need to do all the things on Twitch and I need to be streaming more.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So I'm so motivated. I get back and my internet is crazy.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Like I'm not able to upload the speeds that I usually upload at.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So my 10 megabit upload for some reason is only five megabits when I uploaded Twitch.

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But yet even if I lower my bit rate down to like 4000 or something under that, I still have problems.

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So there's something really weird and I don't want to get into it on this show.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I've detailed it on my Twitter at MrRobRoberts. I did actually a Twitch video tonight.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So what I did, I used that whole premiere thing on Twitch.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I recorded a video for 40 minutes at like two o'clock.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I like played one of the new dungeons in World of Warcraft since I've been tinkering in that expansion.

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And then I scheduled a premiere for like 4.15 or whenever my video was finally done processing.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And so it premiered right at that time.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And so it was like a pseudo live stream.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I wasn't really live, but it was like I was live. I just didn't have the chat comments.

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So I guess it's kind of like here at Vaga Network.

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Our radio feed is, you know, we have new episodes of Pod Culture, Mondays, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You know, it's kind of like a premiere in that regard.

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's kind of what I did on Twitch.

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So I talked much more about that.

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So if you want to see my Twitch channel, MrRobRoberts, I get into all the details about what's going on back and forth.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But I'm just in such a good mood now to be doing this show because I feel like my rhythm got thrown

87
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
when I was at my most motivated I've been throughout the year post Dragon Con.

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And so, yeah, it's just it feels great to be back.

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'll talk about Dragon Con a little more later on, but it is a video game show.

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And there's a lot of big video game news going on this week, namely the Nintendo Direct.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Why don't we dive into that first, especially because this might be the show.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I mean, hopefully the first OLR people are hearing coming off Dragon Con is not the one where I got very emotional,

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
which is the last, which is the show that's been sitting on the feed for three weeks before we went to Dragon Con.

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But I would like to like to have a little enthusiasm, a little talk here on video games and what's going on with Nintendo.

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So obviously everybody's talking about this Nintendo Direct.

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Loki, let's jump in. What did Nintendo do with their Direct?

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
They announced games.

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Well, that's good. We like game. We like game announcements, right?

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah. And then they talk.

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Nintendo's biggest critic. How do you on this show, how do you how do you feel coming off this Nintendo Direct?

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
OK. It wasn't like like I saw one, especially like I paid attention.

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Actually, that's when I came in the shows when they were talking about their online services, like in the middle of that.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
OK. It's just all right.

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I mean, it's not very fleshed out, but you're not paying a lot for it.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So I guess it's that's like. And what do you what do you expect?

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You're getting a vanilla program for vanilla dollars. Yes, exactly.

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So it's just all right. Well, for all the people that roll their eyes when you start to go off on Nintendo, I think they will take.

108
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And it was OK. It was it wasn't like I didn't have high expectations and they met those non high expectations, I guess.

109
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't know what to basically say. I mean, so they announced games, so they had lots of different things.

110
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Three DS games that, you know, Kirby's extra epic yarn. They had Luigi's Mansion three coming to the switch.

111
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
They talked a little bit about the new update for Splatoon two.

112
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Mario Tennis Aces was getting DLC. They are remastering New Super Mario Brothers U.

113
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
OK, well, we're like machine gunning this and I've got so much to say.

114
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
No, that's OK. So Splatoon two, I didn't really I my my feed kind of hiccuped, so I didn't really see everything.

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Is it true that this is their battle royale update?

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's like if I know I didn't watch any of that part.

117
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So, OK, then I need the help of our chatters over at live dot vog network dot com because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network,

118
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
vog network dot com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And part of the fun of doing the show live is that we have a chat room to give us their call.

120
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Steer us when we go adrift.

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
They were, I know, changing up some stuff, how they do Splat Fest to go along with this as well.

122
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So once that online service comes.

123
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Dartetsuya straight up says, yeah, I wasn't sure what that was about TBH.

124
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The parts of the trailer I saw were really kind of abstract, like it didn't really explain what was new.

125
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And one of my buddies was the one that told me that it was like a battle royale update.

126
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But I don't know if that was just that's what I want or if it's what what I read somewhere.

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah. Nifty asks, where's Flacco? He's the Splatoon expert. He's a podcast listener.

128
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He's probably shouting the answer in his car right now.

129
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Like I know one of the things I think they changed with the Splat Fest.

130
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's now they have kind of like a casual and competitive mode for the Splat Fest.

131
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So they split it up that way as well.

132
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't know. I'm not in the Splatoon, so I didn't pay attention to it. Plus I came in late.

133
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I was walking. I walk now. Apparently that's the thing I do.

134
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
OK, I'm actually loading Nintendo's site to see what the heck's going on.

135
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
They're saying new weapons set that are part of the Kensa collections.

136
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The whole Splat Fest refresh that you're talking about.

137
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
New sub and special weapons are also on the way.

138
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So this doesn't say anything about the whole battle royale.

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But it says that Splatoon will have two new modes, normal and pro, that replace the solo and team modes and all that.

140
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And normal means you go into a Splat Fest battle on your own.

141
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And if it's, yeah, if you go into pro, then what is this?

142
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You get into, where is this? No, it's talking about the ink. That's still just talking about the casual mode.

143
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh, pro is for you want to go solo and push themselves to the limit.

144
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You're judging your Splat Fest power. You can get into the top 100.

145
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So that sounds like something that Flaco will be going for over on his stream.

146
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So, cheap plug for Flaco Jones over on Twitch. Flaco underscore Jones.

147
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I don't think I've seen him not stream Splatoon in a long time.

148
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Alright, well that's cool for the people that are still turning away at Splatoon. That's cool to see what the game's still getting love.

149
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
They did talk about the NES classic games that they're going to have on there.

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah, cool. I saw some really cool stuff in there.

151
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
River City Ransom. I don't remember that in the first list of 10.

152
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yeah, I mean it looks nice. It's a nice interface and everything. They're going to have online play for some of those as well.

153
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
This really does feel like what we should have had on the Wii.

154
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah, or like the NES classic system.

155
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And then if you want to get in on that NES classic gaming and you want to get some Joy-Con controllers that look like NES controllers,

156
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
you can do that if you subscribe to the service and it's going to be one per account that gets to purchase those.

157
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Do you think this is an anti-scalping measure? Because as an anti-scalping measure, I've seen a lot of hate for this on the internet,

158
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
but as an anti-scalping measure, I'm like, yes, finally Nintendo's doing something about all the scalping of their products.

159
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Maybe, but they probably think, well you don't need it if you're not paying for the service.

160
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I guess. Although you know what the twist is, if you have a family plan, because you know some people were talking about doing family plan pools,

161
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
because family plans can be shared and I don't know, I think it was like seven accounts or something.

162
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Some people were talking about doing the family plan. You can't get more than one with the family plan.

163
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So if you go into one of these pools with five other people, only one of you is getting those NES controllers if you want it.

164
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't know.

165
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's what eBay's for.

166
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
If you buy it and you're like, I don't want this shit, and then you're like, how am I gonna sell it for $400?

167
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't know if I really need those controllers. I mean, it's like saying that the Joy-Cons are bad for playing.

168
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I think the Joy-Cons are fine.

169
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Most likely I'm not playing Nintendo games over the internet with people. That's not what I'm gonna use the service for.

170
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This is where you and I are different. I'm gonna use this a lot. I hope. I hope there's people that want to play this game.

171
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
If I'm gonna spend $60 on those controllers, I might as well just buy a fucking NES classic because what's the fucking point at that point?

172
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:44,000
This is why I want my Twitch stream to work. Because I think playing something like River City Ransom with Bobby or my buddy Delvin or something online would be a lot of fun.

173
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Because then we can laugh and hoot and holler when one of the characters goes barf with the exclamation point as they do in River City Ransom.

174
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So, I'm really looking forward to the online thing. I've been waiting like 10 years to play Virtual Console games online, so this part is super exciting to me.

175
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I mean, sure, I wish there were Super Nintendo games. I wish there were N64 games. I wish there was more. I wish this wasn't being drip-fed, but it's something. I'll take it.

176
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You know what? It's better than nothing. This is what we have today.

177
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I still don't understand what their fucking app does.

178
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
For a lot of people, nothing. And I think that's part of the reason why some people...

179
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Well, you know this whole online thing when Nintendo's getting a lot of hate online? People are like,

180
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Why is Nintendo charging this money?

181
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Well, for one, Nintendo warned you this was coming. I mentioned this on the last OLR we did.

182
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's on the back of every Switch game that's online.

183
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It says it's free until the launch of Nintendo's online system, which was supposed to be like summer.

184
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Like last year. I don't have a Switch game in front of me, but I'm pretty sure a lot of those disclaimers are like,

185
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It was supposed to be pay a long time ago. This whole thing has just been a courtesy extension or whatever.

186
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So, I don't know. What are you getting with Xbox Live and PlayStation Plus?

187
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Free games. Like free new games. Like recent games.

188
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Okay. And to be fair, Nintendo's service is a hell of a lot cheaper.

189
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's $20 a year versus $50.

190
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But you're getting a lot more full-price games.

191
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I understand that you're paying less, but you're getting less.

192
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But that's okay. I don't see where the problem is to complain about that.

193
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:44,000
My thing with it is, Nintendo I think values the value that they see their NES games, their old NES games,

194
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
is higher than what I perceive them to be.

195
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I think they should be much cheaper.

196
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Should never have been charging $5 a piece for that shit. Never.

197
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And so they feel that it's, oh, you're getting such a value because they're like $5, $8 a piece.

198
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Whereas in reality, maybe not so much.

199
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I mean, great, yeah. Super Mario Bros. 3, great fucking game.

200
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But it's been a great fucking game for decades now.

201
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And it's old. It's old. It is.

202
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And that is still a great game.

203
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But dude, like fucking new movies that come out,

204
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
like movies that are decades old aren't necessarily being,

205
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
they're not priced at the same as a brand new blockbuster movie that just came out.

206
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's because that shit's been out forever and the demand for it isn't as high.

207
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Granted, people like being nostalgic and they bought the NES classic systems and stuff like that.

208
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And I'm sure this will be popular for a while, but it's not the same as getting like Switch games.

209
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Like, you know, if they offered, you know, even though I don't fucking want it,

210
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
hey, 1-2 Switch is the free game this month or something like that.

211
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You know, like an actual Switch game.

212
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yeah, but then that would be a steal if they were charging $20 bucks a year.

213
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Not a month, Loki. A year.

214
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
If they were charging $20 bucks a year and giving you stuff on that level,

215
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
then like that would be, Nintendo would be like losing money on it.

216
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's why they can't, they could charge more for it if they offered more as a service.

217
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Oh yeah, I see. All right, I get what you're getting.

218
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But they're not because they don't have it there because they're,

219
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
this is kind of like fucking Little League shit, you know?

220
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So that's fine. Let's, let's let them take baby steps into it.

221
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm glad that they're actually doing an online service fucking decades late, but whatever.

222
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't remember free games being a part of Xbox Live back on the 360.

223
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So, you know, it took them time to grow too.

224
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I just think a lot of people had the expectation that Nintendo was going to mirror.

225
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Here's what I think happened.

226
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I think a lot of people had the expectation that Nintendo was going to mirror what Xbox Live and PlayStation do.

227
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Meaning you're going to be able to, like, people, I swear,

228
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I think there were people out there that was expecting this Direct to be like,

229
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
now you can stream your games online through the Switch.

230
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You can do SharePlay with a friend through the Switch.

231
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You can have trophies and achievements that get online.

232
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Like people are just straight up making shit up.

233
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Why they can't just have like, okay, these NES games have the multiplayer component to them.

234
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And, you know, later on other NES games could get that multiplayer update as well.

235
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But for now, you can still play them, but they're single player or you can play them on the local co-op.

236
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Why can't they do that?

237
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You wanted that avalanche of like a hundred NES games.

238
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Why can't they do that? Because they could have totally done that.

239
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's just that they're like, no, no, no.

240
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
We need to make sure that we get them all happening in multiplayer.

241
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You know what? There's one player NES games out there.

242
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
There's plenty of one player NES games, fucking Legend of Zelda.

243
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm sure that's part of it, but that doesn't need fucking two players in it.

244
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
There's lots of one player NES games that you just throw up there.

245
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Don't tell me you can't fucking run on that because homebrew runs that shit.

246
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Okay, Orange Right in our chat at live.vognetware.com says,

247
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
it's good that there is an import and a game that was never on the Virtual Console in the first year.

248
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
They didn't wait until 2019.

249
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Granted, it's Twinbee and Pro Wrestling, but still, and not to insult Twinbee.

250
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Okay, well, that is neat that at least there is, I mean, Pro Wrestling was not that good of a game.

251
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And that's not me slamming wrestling.

252
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Like there was a WrestleMania game on NES that was cool,

253
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
but Nintendo's Pro Wrestling game was like not that good.

254
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But it is still neat that, you know, it's there,

255
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
and it's something that you can make a decision for yourself on if it's good or not.

256
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And the thing that is actually kind of cool about this whole Nesflix-style system that they have

257
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
is that if you play it and decide after 30 seconds you don't like it,

258
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
well, it came with your subscription to play Mario Kart online anyway.

259
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So, I mean, I don't know, I'm kind of, I'm into it.

260
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Like, I, you know, we knew Nintendo was going to be charging for online.

261
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's not that expensive, all things considered.

262
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'll probably just plop down for a year up front,

263
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
and now I'll have these NES games I can play on friends of mine.

264
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I think it's going to be cool.

265
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm going to do that as well because it's not expensive,

266
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
and because I need to if I ever want to play online, although I have not.

267
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It would have been fantastic if Reggie came out of that direct and said,

268
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
100 NES classics and 50 Super Nintendo classics all out the gate,

269
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
and you get a game, and you get a game, and you get a game.

270
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But, you know what, this is the more realistic approach. It's fine.

271
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
We all knew Nintendo was going to drip-feed it.

272
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I just wanted to keep the pace up.

273
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
If they're going to add three more to the pot every month, like their show,

274
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
like, keep that up for five years.

275
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You know what I mean?

276
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Make sure you have that plan to keep this going for years,

277
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
because I imagine, you know, and I'm okay with, okay,

278
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
and then when they run out of NES games, let's say in a year's time,

279
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
that they want to do, now the Super Nintendo games start coming,

280
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
and then the N64 or whatever they decide to do.

281
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But it's very obvious that they're not looking to do everything,

282
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
or we wouldn't have things like this SNK collection, the Sega Ages.

283
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Like, this is not going to go down the same path, or arcade archives.

284
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
This is not going to go down the same path as Virtual Console.

285
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Nintendo is keeping this Nintendo.

286
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I think it's a given we'll get Super Nintendo eventually.

287
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I just hope, one more thing I'm going to say about this,

288
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I just hope it doesn't go the whole DS route where it's,

289
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
well, you need the new 3DS to play this, because you all know,

290
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
we all know, we all know there will be a Switch Deluxe of some sort.

291
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It will happen.

292
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Maybe not next year, but, you know, around the time that PlayStation

293
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and Sony and Microsoft are starting to show off what's next for them,

294
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Nintendo's going to be like,

295
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
well, how about the power of the Switch Deluxe?

296
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And now you can play Super Nintendo games,

297
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
but only through the power of the Switch Deluxe.

298
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
To which I'll tell them, fuck your stupid, super whatever Switch game.

299
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Be prepared. Be prepared.

300
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
That shit can fucking play Wii games now, okay?

301
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I know, it should. It should fucking.

302
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It is playing Wii U games.

303
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
This is about as stupid as saying Sony's PlayStation 4

304
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
can't fucking handle PlayStation 1 games.

305
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's goddamn retarded.

306
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's just, you can't say that intelligently.

307
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's dumb.

308
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
The system can fucking handle Super Nintendo games.

309
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Alright, let's move on.

310
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What else did we have, Logie?

311
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Anyways.

312
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Katamari reroll, so they're re-remastering that again.

313
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Okay, yay. I'm very happy about that.

314
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Because the last time it came out was remastered,

315
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
so it's fucking remastered yet again.

316
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You know what, though? I seem to recall,

317
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
the first two games were the good ones,

318
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
and then it didn't get very good after that,

319
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
because I don't think the guy who created Katamari was with it anymore,

320
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
and so they started to kind of, you know, roll off the rails a little bit.

321
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So, I'm okay with a remaster of the first game. I really am.

322
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's been long enough.

323
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Let's revisit it in glorious widescreen.

324
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm imagining it's a down...

325
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Oh no, maybe they are going to release it as a cartridge.

326
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But whatever. I'm in.

327
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's Katamari.

328
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Well, yeah. I have to get it.

329
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Yeah, I know, right?

330
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm just disappointed that it's not new,

331
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
because it needs to be new.

332
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm sorry, I'm screaming over here.

333
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
SSG100Matt in chat says,

334
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Last time Katamari was this big in the news,

335
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
OLR was in trouble over it.

336
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Truth.

337
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's true, yeah.

338
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
How quickly we forget the Vita game.

339
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
How quickly we forget there was a Katamari launch game on the Vita.

340
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Alright, anyway.

341
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Was it Touch My Katamari?

342
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Maybe. I don't remember what it was called.

343
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah, probably.

344
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It was not very good, from what I remember.

345
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It was okay.

346
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
But yeah, I mean, it just, you know,

347
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
it wasn't enough to keep the Katamari games,

348
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
or games in general, coming on the Vita.

349
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Alright, so yay, Katamari. What else?

350
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And then, of course,

351
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
they were showing off

352
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
the new fighter for Smash Brothers.

353
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And, of course,

354
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
coming from Animal Crossing.

355
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And then, of course,

356
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Animal Crossing itself.

357
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So there was the fake tease that,

358
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
oh hey, it's just an Animal Crossing character, fighter, and...

359
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But then, oh ho ho!

360
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
There's also Animal Crossing.

361
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah. And Tom Nook.

362
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I was hoping Tom Nook would be the fighter, but you know.

363
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Yeah, I actually thought it would be a reveal

364
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
that Tom Nook was like a shadow character.

365
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
That would have been kind of rad.

366
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
As if I'm poo-pooing the news of a new Animal Crossing.

367
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
No, that's very exciting.

368
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
But, you know, like literally two minutes before the direct,

369
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I wrote this tweet that was like,

370
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I can't live tweet the direct,

371
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
because I need my phone to be able to watch it.

372
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So, you know, lower those expectations.

373
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Don't expect them to announce a new Animal Crossing.

374
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And then, of course, when that first trailer started,

375
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I was like, aw, motherfucker.

376
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
They're going to announce Animal Crossing right after I wrote that tweet.

377
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I pretty, like, she says something like,

378
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
the mayor's away or something.

379
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
She says something where it's very obvious,

380
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
oh, she's going to reveal that she's in Smash.

381
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Of course, Isabel in Smash rumors were out there months ago,

382
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
you know, and it's a very logical character to add to the game.

383
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
So, of course.

384
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And then I was like, oh, okay.

385
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
So that's what they're announcing.

386
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Wow, what a troll.

387
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
This is an epic troll.

388
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And then the second trailer started,

389
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and the disclaimer came up again on the screen,

390
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
may not reflect actual gameplay.

391
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And that's when I knew, oh, this is an actual Animal Crossing reveal.

392
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
They just fucked my tweet.

393
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But you know what?

394
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
If I'm going to be wrong, that's the reason I want to be wrong.

395
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm never happier to be wrong than cases like that.

396
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I just, you know, I knew a new Animal Crossing game would happen someday.

397
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Of course, one's going to happen.

398
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I just didn't think it would be this soon.

399
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I really did think Nintendo was going to focus on the mobile thing,

400
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
but maybe because the mobile version hasn't really taken off for them,

401
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
they decided, let's do this.

402
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
So they had a new Game Freak game called Town.

403
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It's a working title.

404
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So that looked interesting.

405
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It all takes place within one town or something.

406
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Oh, yeah.

407
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
RPG.

408
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
They had, what was it?

409
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy, and more Final Fantasy.

410
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Crystal Chronicles Remastered, Final Fantasy XV Pocket was out that day.

411
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
World of Final Fantasy Maxima,

412
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Chocobo's Dungeon, Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy IX, Final Fantasy X, X-2,

413
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and Final Fantasy XII.

414
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Sorry, no, VIII or VI.

415
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Okay, here's, okay.

416
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Can we talk about this for a minute?

417
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Okay, first off, I am so here for the Chocobo Dungeon

418
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
and for Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

419
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Where's that Fox Chocobo racing?

420
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
That should have been the racing title that should have been highlighted there.

421
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Where's my Chocobo racing remaster?

422
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm not going to disagree.

423
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So here's what's obviously happening.

424
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Square Enix is taking all of their PC ports that they've done recently

425
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
and are going back into Unity or whatever and export to Switch.

426
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Obviously, I'm very much oversimplifying what really happens.

427
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I know that.

428
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But we know they're taking their PC ports and basically now porting them over to Switch

429
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
because it shouldn't be that difficult.

430
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Especially like the X and X-2, those were on PlayStation 3,

431
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
as was Final Fantasy VII was a download title on PlayStation 4.

432
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I don't remember if IX was, but I know it was a PC title.

433
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So obviously they're dumping this whole library onto the Switch, which is cool.

434
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I mean, I got really excited seeing that Final Fantasy XII is on the Switch,

435
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
but then I'm like, I've already bought that game two times.

436
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Once on PC, once on PlayStation 4.

437
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm not going to buy it again on the Switch just to have it portable,

438
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
but I think it's great for the people that maybe only have a Switch at home

439
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
and not a PC strong enough to run it.

440
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
That's cool for them.

441
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
They'll finally get to play the game, yay.

442
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But I find it fascinating just how much of the talk on Twitter is,

443
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
where's Final Fantasy VIII, though?

444
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Do you hate VIII?

445
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Where's Final Fantasy VIII?

446
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And I'm like, they just announced seven, nine, ten, ten, two, twelve.

447
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
They announced five Final Fantasy games,

448
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
and you're complaining about the one that's not there.

449
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And here's the thing.

450
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Most people that are making that, I say most people,

451
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
because I know there's going to be somebody that pops up and says,

452
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
no, I'm very serious about my complaints.

453
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Most people that are writing those tweets and complaining

454
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Nintendo hates Final Fantasy VIII or whatever the hell they're saying out there,

455
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
would probably not buy it anyway,

456
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
and are not going to buy seven or nine, which are very similar.

457
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And this goes beyond, look, I know you all know I don't care for Final Fantasy VIII.

458
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It is my least favorite Final Fantasy game.

459
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I said it. Deal with it.

460
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And the reason why, it's not the story.

461
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I get that y'all are tied to the story.

462
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It's not the story that upsets me.

463
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
The story's fine.

464
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
The story should have been the Final Fantasy movie they did.

465
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It's that draw junction thing completely ruins the gameplay for me.

466
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Deal with it.

467
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
But here's the thing.

468
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I don't understand.

469
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Finally, after all these years, we can say Final Fantasy VII is on a Nintendo system.

470
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Who would have thought we would ever see the day?

471
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
But yet everybody just wants to complain.

472
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But where's VIII?

473
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Well, did you think that maybe if you support some of these other games,

474
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
maybe there will be incentive to do VIII?

475
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Maybe VIII was not as portable.

476
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Because, again, they just recently did VII on PlayStation 4.

477
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I'm not talking about the remake.

478
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm talking about, remember at the PlayStation experience a couple years ago,

479
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
they announced Final Fantasy VII available today.

480
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And it had that audience reaction of the stone faces

481
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
because it was the old Final Fantasy VII.

482
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So that is what is going on the Switch as is, you know, X, X-2, X-12.

483
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
We all know what we're getting with that.

484
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
So it's just, you know, for whatever reason VIII just isn't as easily portable.

485
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
But if these other Final Fantasy games do well,

486
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
then I would imagine they're going to have the incentive to maybe go back

487
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and do some of these other Final Fantasy games,

488
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
which would include, yes, maybe VIII.

489
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I kind of don't want them to do Final Fantasy V and VI

490
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
if they're just going to slap those mobile ports that are on Steam

491
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
over to the Switch because those games deserve better.

492
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
But, you know, we'll see what happens.

493
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I think it's still exciting to have Square Enix games,

494
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Final Fantasy games and all this coming out on the Switch this much.

495
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I'm here for Crystal Chronicles and Chocobo Dungeon.

496
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
The rest of them, I've already bought them,

497
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
so I don't see myself buying them again just to have them portable.

498
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
That's it.

499
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Anyway, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

500
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
YYR says, hold up, I have a question.

501
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Did they announce the Final Fantasy VII remake for Switch

502
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
or just an old port of Final Fantasy VII?

503
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
No, not the remake, just old port.

504
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Yeah, it's not going to be able to run the remake.

505
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
That's why Final Fantasy XV looks the way it does.

506
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Yeah, so, well, the Final Fantasy XV has been out on phones for forever.

507
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
That's why I'm nervous that they're going to just do V and VI

508
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
and that terrible chrono tribute PC thing next.

509
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I know, it's so weird that the Switch runs mobile games quite well.

510
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You know what else runs on mobile platforms?

511
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Fucking Super Nintendo games, that's right!

512
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Alright, anyway.

513
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
SST100Matt says, I just found it funny that they so obviously skipped VIII.

514
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I also don't like Final Fantasy VIII, but I mean,

515
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
just because they didn't announce it now,

516
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
doesn't mean they won't come out with it later.

517
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I mean, the big oversight of VIII, when it's like 7, 9, 10,

518
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
we all know why they don't do XI, it's online,

519
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
and XII, you know, it's like, there's very obviously-

520
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
No, I don't know why they don't do XI.

521
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Why isn't XI on the Switch?

522
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Fair enough, but there's very obviously a number missing in that sequence,

523
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
which for me, when I'm not a big fan of Final Fantasy VIII,

524
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
is great for trolling tweets, but I'm not really trying to be an asshole.

525
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Like, I'll get my one little troll tweet out of my system,

526
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
and then it's like, but, you know, for those that like VIII,

527
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I do hope it comes out eventually.

528
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And from what I understand, the PC version did allow you to draw 99 Magics or something.

529
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Like, there was a cheat built into it, so that if you hated the system like I do,

530
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
it made it a lot easier, but it's like, but the system's still there in the first place.

531
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You even have to draw one still, it's bleh.

532
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Anyway.

533
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I think it'll go okay for him.

534
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

535
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I might buy Final Fantasy IX only because I haven't bought it a second time yet.

536
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Well, there you go.

537
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Fifth Dream says, I love VIII.

538
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I thought I was the only one, though.

539
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Not if you check Twitter.

540
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Not if you check Twitter.

541
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
You would think the whole world VIII is their favorite.

542
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I was like, where were you people to fight me earlier?

543
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Anyway.

544
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
All right, so Final Fantasy Galore from Square Enix, that's pretty cool.

545
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And then of course they showed Daemon Ex Machina,

546
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
which is the kind of armored core spiritual successor type thing.

547
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Oh yeah, that looked interesting.

548
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Civ VI.

549
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Yay!

550
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And it didn't look like it was a cartoonified Civ Revolution type thing,

551
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
which actually I love Civ Revolution, so I wouldn't even care if it was that.

552
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
But it looks like it really is just Civ VI, but on the Switch.

553
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
So that's pretty cool.

554
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And then Yoshi's Crafted World.

555
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
That looked cute.

556
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Yeah, it looked neat.

557
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Yeah.

558
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I mean, obviously it's a throwback to Super Mario World II, Yoshi's Island.

559
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And there's been a few other games inspired by that since,

560
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
like the yarn Yoshi Wooly World or whatever that was.

561
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Yeah.

562
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
So.

563
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
That's all I can think of.

564
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
All right.

565
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And then, what was I going to say?

566
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
They had a fighting game collection, or not fighting game,

567
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
like an arcade brawler collection that was from Capcom.

568
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Oh yeah.

569
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I was like, oh yeah, the Final Fight and all those games.

570
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
You know what's interesting, and we should talk about this,

571
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
a lot of those announcements were not unique to Switch.

572
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
That beat-em-up collection is coming out on PlayStation, pretty much everything.

573
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
The Final Fantasy ports, as the Nintendo Direct is going on,

574
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Major Nelson puts out a tweet that says, hey, guess what?

575
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
We've got all these Final Fantasy games coming out on Xbox soon.

576
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And they're getting all the same stuff except they don't have Pocket Edition

577
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
or Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon for whatever reason.

578
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
But like the 7, the 9, the 10, 10, 2, 12, all of that is also on Xbox.

579
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It was just funny because it was very much a, hey, over here you guys,

580
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
over here, me too, you guys, us over here, I'm cool too.

581
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Don't forget your Xbox, we love you.

582
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It was just kind of a funny moment on Twitter.

583
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I don't know.

584
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It struck me as just kind of funny that Microsoft was like, we're cool too.

585
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
But the thing with Microsoft, and maybe this speaks to the state

586
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
of where I'm at with my Xbox One, I don't know.

587
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I thought the 10 and 10, 2, and Final Fantasy 12,

588
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I thought all of that was already on Xbox One.

589
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I didn't realize Xbox One was skipped over on that stuff.

590
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I thought it was already there.

591
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Yeah, I didn't realize that.

592
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
So I guess that's why they're happy to finally have them.

593
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I don't know.

594
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
So anyway.

595
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
SHO 100 Matt says, Capcom beat-em-up collection.

596
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
That looked cool, and you can do online co-op play.

597
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Well, you'll notice a lot of stuff in that Direct,

598
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
the common theme was online stuff capped with Animal Crossing,

599
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
which is Nintendo's one of their biggest online games,

600
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
next to Smash and stuff.

601
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
But that's a big franchise that people are going to want to play online

602
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
in some capacity.

603
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I mean, we'll find out next year what Animal Crossing will let you do online.

604
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
But in the meantime, Nintendo, besides Smash,

605
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
which they didn't really talk about, which I actually think made people happy.

606
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Yes, there was the Isabelle reveal,

607
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
but outside of that, they didn't really talk about Smash Brothers,

608
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
and I think that's what people were hoping for,

609
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
is that we wanted to hear about some other stuff.

610
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
But I think a lot of the games they did talk about,

611
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
they really relied on some of the third-party stuff.

612
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
You have a lot of online stuff.

613
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Like, there's a reason why the focus from Square out the gate

614
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
was Crystal Chronicles remaster,

615
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
because that's the one you're going to play online,

616
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
not seven, not nine.

617
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Online is the Crystal Chronicles remaster.

618
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Diablo 3 was brought up again,

619
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
which we knew that that was probably originally going to be

620
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
part of some type of Nintendo online announcement.

621
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
But they announced it for Gamescom, and now we got this instead.

622
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
But they still talked about it to remind us that

623
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Diablo 3 is going to be online.

624
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And then they showed us that

625
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
that Deus Machina thing looked very online,

626
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
shooter-y type of thing, too.

627
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
So I'm surprised they didn't give us an update on Fortnite

628
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
or something on top of all this stuff.

629
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Fortnite doesn't use it.

630
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Oh yeah, that's right. That's right.

631
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
We didn't mention Fortnite during the online presentation,

632
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
because it doesn't need it.

633
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Fortnite doesn't need it.

634
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I still think Nintendo should have snuck it in there as a

635
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
this is the system to play Fortnite on you guys,

636
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
because, Loki, everybody's playing Fortnite.

637
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Everybody is playing Fortnite.

638
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
So I went on a random trip to San Francisco this weekend,

639
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
and we went by the Microsoft store at the big mall there downtown,

640
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
ironically not far from the Metreon,

641
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
which used to be Sony's big thing.

642
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
But we were at the Microsoft store there,

643
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
and what is on all the laptops and all the game consoles,

644
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
and what are people playing that they could probably be playing on their phones

645
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
or they're playing Fortnite? They're all playing Fortnite.

646
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And we were in the Razer store.

647
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And in the Razer store, what's being demoed on the computers?

648
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Fortnite. I mean, Fortnite is the game right now.

649
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
But it's, I mean, if this had been four or five years ago,

650
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
it would have been Minecraft.

651
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You know, it's just, it's the hot shit of the moment.

652
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
So I'm just, I'm really surprised that Nintendo did not try to drop

653
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
a Fortnite thing in there somewhere. That's all.

654
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
That's the only thing with online, I'm just kind of surprised.

655
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
But otherwise, I like the Direct myself.

656
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I thought there was a lot of good stuff in there.

657
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
So, kudos Nintendo.

658
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Even though they had to push it back a week,

659
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
you know, because of the hurricane that happened,

660
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I totally respect, but I respect what they had to do.

661
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
That's totally fine.

662
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And interesting the effect that that had, though,

663
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
because the Civ 6 thing got leaked early because of that,

664
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
because, you know, somebody had a scheduled post

665
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
over at 2K or something to go up,

666
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
and it still went up even though the Direct got delayed.

667
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
So we all knew about Civ 6 a week early.

668
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And then, you know, other little things, you know,

669
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
kind of started trickling out.

670
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So it was just interesting to watch that effect

671
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
of what happened with the delay.

672
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
But certainly I understand why Nintendo delayed it.

673
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Yeah.

674
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And it gave us something to talk about this week.

675
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
All right, so anything else with the Nintendo Direct we need to talk about?

676
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
How about you guys in chat over at live.vognetwork.com?

677
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
They also mentioned, of course, you know,

678
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
there's this save, special, you know,

679
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
cloud saves that you can do.

680
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
One thing, though, about that, though,

681
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
is if you stop subscribing to the service, you lose the cloud saves.

682
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And you might not be able to get that stuff back.

683
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Which, on the other platforms, there is a six month window

684
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
in which you can access those.

685
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Oh, that's good.

686
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You're just going to have to know to pull them down

687
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
before your thing expires.

688
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
But you can't even back them up on a USB stick or anything.

689
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
You have to pull them down to your system and hope your system doesn't fry.

690
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
That's it.

691
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It's stupid.

692
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I think Nintendo could do a lot better with that.

693
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
They're worried about being hacked is what it is.

694
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Too late! It's fucking too late for that.

695
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Just who cares at this point?

696
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Yeah. All right.

697
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Before we get into our gaming weeks,

698
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I want to talk a little bit about Dragon Con, actually.

699
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
So Dragon Con was so much fun. It was great.

700
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I got to do a variety of panels.

701
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I talked about all the panels I was going to moderate on the last show,

702
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
but I did a panel with Mass Effect voice actors.

703
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
That was kind of the first big gaming related thing that I did.

704
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And that was really cool.

705
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Even though the game is old at this point,

706
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I mean, I say it's old because Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2

707
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
are like ten and eight years old.

708
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
These titles are aging.

709
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
There's still so much love for the series.

710
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Mass Effect Andromeda only came up once,

711
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
to which the question asker was quickly reminded.

712
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
None of the people at the panel had anything to do with Andromeda.

713
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So I actually kind of jumped in.

714
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I see my role as moderator to kind of deflect some of the questions

715
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
from the celebrities when maybe it's something they don't want to get into.

716
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
So as the moderator, I kind of said my piece about Andromeda.

717
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I think a lot of us were, and I've said it here on the show,

718
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
a lot of us were really rooting for that game, and it came out,

719
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
maybe it could have had a little more time in the oven,

720
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
and it's unfortunate they weren't given that time.

721
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And the audience gave the applause that they agreed and all that stuff.

722
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And we moved on from that, because that's that.

723
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
But lots of other, it's cool to hear about their other projects and things.

724
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Courtney Taylor, who voices Jack in the game,

725
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
she works with this organization called Nerds Vote

726
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
that registers people to vote at conventions.

727
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
So I wanted to give that a shout out.

728
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Hopefully at some point I can get her or somebody else

729
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
that works on that project here on the show to talk about that.

730
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I would love to do that at a later date,

731
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
before the elections in November, obviously.

732
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So a reminder, register to vote if you haven't already.

733
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
So that was really cool.

734
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And then I did a panel with the voice actors

735
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
from Five Nights at Freddy's, sister location,

736
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
where we actually played through the game.

737
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I didn't play, thankfully.

738
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
A Twitch streamer, her name is Panina Chan, shout out.

739
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
She did the actual playthrough.

740
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
They're live with the voice actors,

741
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
and it was actually a lot of fun because the whole audience,

742
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I did not realize how many kids are in Five Nights at Freddy's.

743
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Boy, did I underestimate how many kids are in Five Nights at Freddy's.

744
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
There's a new hotness on there, too, now.

745
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
My son's totally into ink.

746
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Was it, God, what the fuck is it?

747
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Something in the ink machine.

748
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I don't remember what it's called, but it's basically like,

749
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I think Mickey Mouse, but Five Nights at Freddy's.

750
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Oh, no.

751
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
It's like, it's your child's first horror game.

752
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,000
So, yeah, I knew some kids were into it, but I was kind of surprised

753
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
that that was very much a family panel of people that showed up there.

754
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
It was like a lot of mixed ages there.

755
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
So, anyway, you know, we were playing through the game,

756
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
and the voice actors are fun.

757
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
We had some technical difficulties at the beginning,

758
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
so we just did a little bit of light bantering and did some audience questions.

759
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
A couple things struck me.

760
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
One, the voice actors, I mean, they were all great.

761
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
They were all gracious, obviously.

762
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
They're all very young, which is interesting when I'm like,

763
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
wow, you're like maybe 24 tops, and you've accomplished so much more

764
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
in your life than I have, but I thought they were great.

765
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
They were so professional and everything,

766
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
and they were messing with the audience.

767
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
There's this really tense thing where you're crawling through the air vents,

768
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
and then at one point, Kellen, who does the voice of Freddy Fazbear,

769
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
actually just did the voice very loudly in the mic and scared the audience,

770
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
and that was really funny.

771
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
We all had a laugh.

772
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And then, of course, I don't know if she did it on purpose,

773
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
but we knew this had to happen at some point.

774
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Penina Chan triggered a jump scare, and the whole audience was just like, ah!

775
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
And so that was a lot of fun, and of course,

776
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
the voice actors are giggling like crazy because they're all into it

777
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
and think it's funny, and I think one of them was actually legit scared, too,

778
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
because, you know, it's a scary game.

779
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
So I was even kind of looking away.

780
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Bobby Blackwolf was really cool.

781
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
He came to all my panels, even though he wasn't necessarily co-hosting them,

782
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
but he was kind of like my emotional support kitten for all these different panels.

783
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
He's looking away from the screen like,

784
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I know something bad is going to happen.

785
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I'm not going to look at this.

786
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I'm just not going to look at it.

787
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
So that was a lot of fun.

788
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
No, nothing came up on the movie.

789
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I think somebody asked a question to them about did they want to be involved,

790
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
and you can imagine it was like, yes, we would love to be involved with the movie.

791
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Please call us was kind of the direction that we got.

792
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
But sadly for them, I think some of these roles will probably go to,

793
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
you know, the typical movie actors you hear,

794
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
but hopefully they'll get to be involved in some way or another.

795
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,000
And then I did a Twitch 101 panel with one of the engineers from Twitch,

796
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and she was great.

797
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
She was really nice, and we had a really good panel, really productive.

798
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
It was 101, so I was talking about Twitch, like, what is Twitch?

799
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
But there was a lot of people in the audience who had no knowledge of Twitch,

800
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
so I thought that was really cool.

801
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And there were, of course, some affiliates and people of all levels in there,

802
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
but I think even for those people it was a really good networking opportunity

803
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
to meet other live streamers and stuff.

804
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And even I learned, like, I had no idea Twitch had a whole creators' camp online

805
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
that helps you learn how to do this stuff, so I thought that was really cool.

806
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
So that was a really productive panel.

807
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And then the last panel I did from the video game track was probably the biggest.

808
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I did the Overwatch voice actors, and that was a huge ballroom

809
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
that was wired with cameras because that's one of the ballrooms

810
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
that can go on Dragon Con TV, which if you've never been to Dragon Con,

811
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Dragon Con TV is available in all the host hotels in your room during the convention,

812
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,000
and they air select panels on Dragon Con TV so you can watch them in your room

813
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
so you don't have to try to go stand in line or whatever for these panels.

814
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
So if they have a big, like, John Barrowman, every year John Barrowman's there

815
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
and has a panel, it'll be on Dragon Con TV, right?

816
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So if you want to watch that in your room, you can.

817
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Now, my panel was not on Dragon Con TV.

818
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I don't know if it's on the online version, it might be, I don't know,

819
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
but I think what happens is that if one of the other panels has a technical difficulty,

820
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
they will revert to something else.

821
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
So I think we might have been the B panel because all of our stuff was labeled.

822
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
You may be, like, what you don't see on the front of the card has my name on it.

823
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
On the back of the card, what I'm looking at, has a little thing that says,

824
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
smile, you might be on Dragon Con TV, and kind of like a reminder about language and stuff.

825
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Don't pick your fucking nose.

826
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Yeah, pretty much.

827
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
How'd you know? Don't pick your fucking nose.

828
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
No, it didn't say that.

829
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
But anyway, Bobby Blackwell says it is most likely on the online version.

830
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
So I guess we'll have to, maybe I'll have to pony up the ten bucks and check that out.

831
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I don't know, but here's the funny thing.

832
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I know a bootleg is out there because I searched YouTube when I got home

833
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
and there was a bootleg of the panel out there.

834
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
So it was big enough to be bootlegged.

835
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
But all those voice actresses were, and it was all women,

836
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
because they were all the voice actresses of Diva, Symmetra, and Mercy were there.

837
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And they were all super nice and great.

838
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
And the questions, there was a really, really good question.

839
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
And, like, let me tell you this.

840
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Like, I have to be professional as a moderator and try very hard not to be a big fanboy.

841
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
But I was about to, let me tell you when I was about to, like,

842
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
just jump up and give one of these people a hug.

843
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Anjali, who does the voice of Symmetra,

844
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:05,000
she got a question about what would be the charity skin that you would do?

845
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Because, like, Mercy had the breast cancer awareness skin, right?

846
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
So the question was, what would be the skin that you would want to do and what would it look like?

847
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And Anjali's answer said, well, I think it would be very obvious that Symmetra's

848
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
should do something for an autism charity and autism awareness.

849
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
And, you know, she wanted her charity to be that.

850
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And she wanted the skin for Symmetra to be something that was like a world or global

851
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:36,000
and something that was very inclusive because autism isn't always something that you see.

852
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
There's all these different levels.

853
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
There's all these types of people that are dealing with all different levels of autism.

854
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And it's an issue that can affect so many people.

855
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And she had such an eloquent answer that I'm not really relaying appropriately here on this program.

856
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I'm not giving that answer the eloquence that she gave it.

857
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
But I really just want to jump up and give her a big hug and say that was like the best answer

858
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
you could have possibly given to that question.

859
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
And I was moved by that.

860
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So that was my favorite part of that whole panel, by the way, if you're curious,

861
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
was that particular question and answer.

862
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
NSG100Matt says, yeah, that was well thought out.

863
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Make it happen, Blizzard. Yes, I agree.

864
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
So anyway, yeah, that was a great panel.

865
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
And then I didn't even really talk about it.

866
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And just for time's sake, I probably won't get into it because that's a little more shop on the podcasting track.

867
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And the video game track stuff, with the exception of the ballroom panel,

868
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
if you weren't there, you can't see it.

869
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
It wasn't taped or anything.

870
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,000
But the podcasting track or now in the future digital media creation,

871
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
that all streamed on Facebook Live and all those panels are available to see on Facebook Live.

872
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
So if you want to go check that out, and I encourage you to,

873
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
you can check that out on the Digital Media Creators DragonCon page over on Facebook.

874
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So yeah, lots of fun panels there as well.

875
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
But anyway, I do want to move on for time's sake.

876
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I want to get into a little bit of our gaming weeks.

877
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
And then I want to talk a little bit about one other thing that kind of traces back to DragonCon,

878
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
but it has to do with the future of OLR. I'll get to that in a minute.

879
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Nothing bad. Don't worry.

880
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Most of you already know what it is.

881
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Not everybody may have heard this yet if you're not listening to Bobby Blackwell

882
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
or you weren't following all the DragonCon news.

883
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
So I want to get into that in just a minute.

884
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
But first, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

885
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
And how was your gaming week, Loki?

886
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I did play a few things.

887
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
So I made it out to the arcade at one point to go.

888
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I had some time to kill.

889
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
And so I went and played Danson's Revolution Ace.

890
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And so I got to play a little bit of that.

891
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Not very long, though, because I had to go pick up my kids.

892
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
But I got to play through a few songs of that.

893
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And the interface is really confusing.

894
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Luckily, the dude there spot me in games because he had put a ton of money into the machine,

895
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
which is kind of bad form or whatever for games.

896
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
So I got to play that a bit.

897
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And I don't know.

898
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I don't understand necessarily the new step charts too much.

899
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:08,000
New York Face is all right, but there's a definite change in how it is.

900
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I like how everything kind of defaults to the solo arrows and stuff.

901
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
So it's a little bit easier to see.

902
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I was going into the options and like, OK, I see speed options.

903
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Where's my arrow options that I'm used to on my extreme machine?

904
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Oh, it's not here.

905
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
OK, well, fuck it. I'll just play without it.

906
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Oh, hey, the arrows look like that anyway.

907
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
So that was cool.

908
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
So I played a couple games of that.

909
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And then I did download the demo for Mega Man 11.

910
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
And I played through that.

911
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
That was pretty fun.

912
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I also picked up a game that I talked about on Twitter before

913
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
called Old School Musical.

914
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,000
And it's like a throwback to old school NES 16-bit games as well.

915
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:58,000
And it's this whole story about these two creatures, Robin.

916
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I'm trying to remember the other guy's name.

917
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
But anyways, they basically have to figure out what's going on

918
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
with this world that they're in.

919
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
And so the whole game is played as a rhythm game.

920
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And so you kind of watch as they go through different levels

921
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
that are like a Mega Man level or Metal Gear level

922
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
or Metal Slug or something like that.

923
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
And it's just kind of silly.

924
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
They have this weird thing that has to do with glitches

925
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
and chickens and stuff like that.

926
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
So I played through actually the whole game.

927
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I've already beaten it because it doesn't take too long to get through.

928
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
It's only a rhythm game, so it's like two hours or so.

929
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,000
But then they have this other part that's this chicken mode

930
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
that you have to go through that you play through a bunch of songs.

931
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
And that takes a lot longer, and it's a lot harder

932
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,000
because they have modifiers that appear on your play field.

933
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So it makes it a lot harder to distract you

934
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
or to make it harder to see the stuff that you're supposed to be doing.

935
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
So, very funny game.

936
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
They have lots of parodies for different things.

937
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I posted an image on Twitter where they have a Sydney parody that's Sid.

938
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
So it's an old man dressed up like Sidney from Final Fantasy XV.

939
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Scantily clad and everything. It's hilarious.

940
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Nice.

941
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And like your characters several times.

942
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,000
The younger brothers actually of these two guys is the larger of the two.

943
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And so it kind of throws you off a little bit,

944
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
but he keeps getting dressed in female clothing.

945
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Like in the Metal Gear level, he's dressed up like

946
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
oh god, I can't remember her name,

947
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
but Scantily clad like in Metal Gear Solid 5.

948
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Oh, Q or whatever her name was?

949
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Quest. Quiet.

950
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Quiet, yes. Dressed up like quiet.

951
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Gender is a construct, tear it apart.

952
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
It's just hilarious. It's funny, though, because he's talking about

953
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
why you keep getting dressed up like that.

954
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
He's like, whatever, I'm working it.

955
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Yes, bitch, slay!

956
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
It's funny because he gets dressed up like Princess Zelda at one time.

957
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Oh yeah, there's one level you have to find this guy named Clint,

958
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
which is obviously Link because the chickens have taken him away

959
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
for torturing chickens.

960
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
So very tongue-in-cheek video game references in a don't sue me kind of way.

961
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

962
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
And a lot of the music, too, has kind of like throwbacks to those songs as well.

963
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
And they have a lot of cool stuff in there, so definitely go check it out.

964
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I picked it up on both platforms.

965
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I meant to play it on the Switch, and then my kids demanded I give them the Switch

966
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
like immediately after I bought it, and I'm ready to play it and stuff.

967
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And then my son decides he's going to do homework sitting behind me.

968
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I'm like, motherfucker, you know?

969
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
How dare you do your homework?

970
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
How dare you do your homework?

971
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
And they're like, I want to play something on the Switch.

972
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I'm like, oh, god damn it, you know, so fine.

973
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
So I had to buy it on PC, and I beat it through on PC, and I downloaded the...

974
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
They have some DLC for it as well, but it's like additional tracks.

975
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
It's all chiptunes, so it's pretty awesome.

976
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
But definitely worth checking out.

977
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
It gets pretty difficult, too, as you play through the game.

978
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
And I'm only playing on normal, and there's a difficult mode as well that's even harder.

979
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
So definitely worth checking out.

980
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
It's a great game.

981
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
You need a game, too, so that's pretty cool.

982
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And then, what else did I play?

983
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I don't remember.

984
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I think that was pretty much it.

985
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Yeah, just DDR Extreme at home.

986
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Yeah, I think that was it.

987
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I installed some other stuff.

988
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Well, I played a lot of the LEGO Ninjago game,

989
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,000
because my son keeps having me pass through different parts of that game for him.

990
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
So I played a bit of that.

991
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Oh, I remember.

992
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
What else?

993
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I don't know if I played... I picked up Galaga and Double Peace because it was on sale.

994
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
It's kind of a weird shooter game.

995
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I played it on the Xbox 360 at one time,

996
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
but I haven't gotten a chance to play through much of that.

997
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
But it's just like I remember. It's just silly. Weird.

998
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Very innuendo.

999
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Oh, and then I think I mentioned that I beat Donut Country.

1000
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I don't remember.

1001
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
No, we haven't been here for a little bit.

1002
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Donut Country was another game. That's the one that's like Katamari.

1003
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
It's basically this raccoon that has this tablet,

1004
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
and he opens a donut shop, and he thinks that he is...

1005
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
When people order a donut from him, he delivers a hole

1006
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
that basically sucks up all their trash.

1007
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Which, to him, everything is trash.

1008
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
So he sucks up all their stuff.

1009
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
And so it's talking about this,

1010
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
kind of flashing back to how they all ended up in this hole,

1011
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
or donut.

1012
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
And so...

1013
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
A donut hole?

1014
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Yeah, and so they...

1015
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
It's just a silly thing it has to do with the king of the raccoons and stuff like that.

1016
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
It's just this weird game, but it's a little bit like Katamari,

1017
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
but a little bit more linear

1018
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
because there's no real time limit.

1019
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
You just have this hole that gets bigger as you drop things into it,

1020
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
and you have to solve some puzzles with that.

1021
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Not a whole... It's not a very difficult game, but it's fun.

1022
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
It's got that kind of charm to it that Katamari has.

1023
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Wait, I have to know if this is a reference to the game.

1024
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Puba in our chat room says,

1025
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Loki, have a garbage day.

1026
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Yes, that's...

1027
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Okay, I was like, is that a reference to the game,

1028
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
or did somebody just literally come into chat to tell you to have a bat?

1029
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Because either way, I'm okay with that comment.

1030
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Every level has the same thing.

1031
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
It's the raccoon thing. It's like, have a garbage day.

1032
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Okay, okay, that's funny. I like that.

1033
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
But also, have a garbage day.

1034
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
So that was it. Yeah, that was all I played this week.

1035
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Alright, let me talk about my gaming week.

1036
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
For my gaming week, I've done a lot.

1037
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
So when I was at Dragon Con, Bobby had his whole setup there at Dragon Con with VR.

1038
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
So he had the HTC Vive, which sadly not...

1039
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I didn't play it as much this year as I did previous years,

1040
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
but again, probably just because we were busy.

1041
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I had eight panels and Bobby had six.

1042
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Granted, there was a little bit of overlap,

1043
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
but when he wasn't being my emotional support animal at my panels,

1044
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I was being his.

1045
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
So we were very busy.

1046
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
But we did get to do some VR playing,

1047
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
and he had me play Beat Saber for the first time,

1048
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
which I got to play on the HTC Vive.

1049
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
As a music game fan, I loved Beat Saber. It was so fun.

1050
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
You would love this game, Loki, if you haven't checked it out.

1051
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
They are, and I think that's when most people will really get to check it out.

1052
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
But it was so fun.

1053
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
What's interesting about it,

1054
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
and Bobby was explaining this to me because I didn't know this,

1055
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
but did you know that it's not like DDR in the way that it grades you,

1056
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
or like Beat Mini 2DX?

1057
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
It's not 100% about when you smash the note,

1058
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
but a lot of the flourish that you do...

1059
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Like, did you just go...

1060
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Did you just move your hand slightly to break it,

1061
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
or did you do a big, graceful swing of the sword

1062
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
that followed through and broke it?

1063
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Because if you do more movement, you get more points,

1064
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
which I think is kind of neat.

1065
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Of course, Perfect Attack, people are very upset about it

1066
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
and write angry things on the internet,

1067
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
but I think it's their game. They can do whatever they want.

1068
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I think the flourishes go with a lot of the music that's in the game,

1069
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
and it has a really cool movement to it.

1070
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
On one hand, I kind of wish you could have seen me play that.

1071
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
On the other hand, I'm very thankful that Bobby

1072
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
did not try to livestream video of me playing that game

1073
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
because it is still a little embarrassing,

1074
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
but it's a lot of fun to play.

1075
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
It's like a must-have VR type of thing.

1076
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
And what's interesting is that at one of the panels

1077
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Bobby was doing, the point came up is that

1078
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
could Beat Saber be done on a TV in a non-VR environment?

1079
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And it's one of those, well, I mean, technically, sure.

1080
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
You could use your mouse and all that and play.

1081
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
It's not going to be the same thing at all.

1082
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Like the experience would not...

1083
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Even with motion controllers, it would just not...

1084
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
No, it really wouldn't. It really wouldn't.

1085
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
There's something about having it right in front of you

1086
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
and really being able to see...

1087
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Are you telling me I can't do this with Kinect?

1088
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Because Kinect can do everything.

1089
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I'm thinking no. I'm thinking you're better off

1090
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
not trying to do this in Kinect, so there you go.

1091
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
And Bobby Blackwolf is in our chat and says,

1092
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
you need the 3D positions of the visuals.

1093
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
It's not about the controls, but the visuals.

1094
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
And I would agree with that for sure.

1095
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
So, yeah, that was Beat Saber. I really enjoyed it.

1096
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
It would be cool if maybe there was a few more songs,

1097
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
but as I understand it, the game is in early access,

1098
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
so that really shouldn't be a critical point at this time.

1099
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I just hope that when they release on PlayStation,

1100
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
maybe they'll get a few more songs.

1101
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
But all right, depending on how much they charge for it,

1102
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I'm sure it'll still be fine on VR.

1103
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Maybe they'll add more to it later, that whole time.

1104
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
That's probably what they've been doing,

1105
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
is kind of adding as they go.

1106
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Bobby does point out that people have modded in songs,

1107
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
but they're just doing like expert hell songs.

1108
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Yes, like the full Shrek movie audio track.

1109
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Okay, for the lolz, okay, funny,

1110
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
but as a practical, would I play this at a party?

1111
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
No, this doesn't work. So, anyway.

1112
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
And YYR in chat says it'll probably remain in early access

1113
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
until it's got a good list, like 30 to 40 at least.

1114
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Okay, cool. Cool.

1115
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
All right, let's talk about other games I've played this week.

1116
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
So when I got home, my copy of Dragon Quest XI was waiting for me.

1117
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
So I've been playing through Dragon Quest XI on PlayStation 4.

1118
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
God, I forget where I'm at.

1119
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I don't want to ruin the story too much,

1120
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
but I just, the sisters just joined my party.

1121
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
That should be vague enough.

1122
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
It's not really spoiling anything,

1123
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
but that's about where I'm at in the game.

1124
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
It's about seven to eight hours in to the game.

1125
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
So, I mean, it's a Dragon Quest game.

1126
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
It's going to move a little slower.

1127
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
It's going to be a very long game, like 100 hours.

1128
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Here's the interesting thing about Dragon Quest.

1129
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I don't think this series has changed at all, really,

1130
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
since the last Dragon Quest game I played,

1131
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
which is Dragon Quest VIII on the PlayStation 2.

1132
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I didn't really play IX.

1133
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
X was online and never released here, so I couldn't.

1134
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
So, I mean, it hasn't really seemed to have changed much since Dragon Quest VIII.

1135
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
But I think that's okay.

1136
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
That's kind of what people want.

1137
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Like, Dragon Quest is that series that hasn't changed a lot.

1138
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I mean, okay, they have the pep system in there now,

1139
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
and you can run around in spots.

1140
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:24,000
They haven't changed where, like, Final Fantasy XIII radically changed the battle system, right?

1141
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
And some people liked it, some people hated it.

1142
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Dragon Quest XI didn't do that to you.

1143
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
It's still, you know, fight, item, run, you know, those basic types of things.

1144
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
That is the JRPG a lot of people want to play.

1145
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Exactly. Square Enix.

1146
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
So, you know what? Well, I mean, Dragon Quest XI is a Square Enix game.

1147
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I know, but they have a whole other series of games called Final Fantasy,

1148
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
where they're like, no, let's change up the battle system yet again.

1149
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Well, I think that's the difference between these two franchises.

1150
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Final Fantasy is going to be a little different,

1151
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
and it's going to push the envelope with graphics and sound and all that,

1152
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
whereas Dragon Quest XI is going to be, you know, the tired and true.

1153
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
And that's not to knock it at all.

1154
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Like, I'm enjoying the story so far.

1155
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
They put voice acting in it, which the Japanese version didn't have.

1156
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Did you know that?

1157
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
There's some hilarious tweets that are like, where's the Japanese voice acting?

1158
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Punchline. There wasn't any.

1159
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
They added the voice acting for the U.S. version.

1160
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
This is the international version, you know, because it's been out in Japan for a year.

1161
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
So they added the voice acting in for the U.S. version.

1162
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
They didn't release the Switch version, though, which is interesting,

1163
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,000
because there is a Switch version, or supposed to be.

1164
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
No, I think there is one in Japan.

1165
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
For whatever reason, they didn't release it here yet.

1166
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I don't know if the voice acting had something to do with that or what it is.

1167
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
There's also a 3DS version they didn't release here,

1168
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
which is interesting.

1169
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
You know, again, maybe because they would have had to not be able to add some of the stuff they did.

1170
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I don't know. I can only play the game that they did release, which is on PlayStation 4.

1171
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,000
And again, if you like Dragon Quest games, this game will satisfy you.

1172
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
However, I'm going to read this game on one thing.

1173
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I'm going to tell you what the worst part of the game is.

1174
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
And this might surprise you.

1175
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Because this is the part of the game...

1176
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I can't think of a game in a long time

1177
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
where I've said this is the worst part of the game.

1178
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
You ready? You know what the worst part of Dragon Quest XI is?

1179
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
The soundtrack.

1180
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
That's right. And I know.

1181
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:26,000
They have an old-school composer that's been doing this franchise for a long time.

1182
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
They have a symphonic rendition that opens the game,

1183
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
except once you're in the game, you no longer have the symphonic renditions.

1184
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
It's like a MIDI rendering.

1185
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Honestly, the game fucking sounds like it's on my AdLib sound card in 1994.

1186
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Which, I guess in some ways is kind of cool, but this is Dragon Quest XI, people.

1187
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
And the songs are just...

1188
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
They're not good.

1189
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
It relies a lot on the retro kitsch of

1190
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
we've been doing this stuff the same way for a long time.

1191
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Even retro songs can sound good.

1192
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Yeah, it doesn't here, Logie. It just doesn't.

1193
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
So that's the one part of the game I'm going to read.

1194
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Not everybody's going to agree with me there.

1195
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Some people haven't already on Twitter, and that's fine.

1196
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
But for me, I just wanted more out of the soundtrack,

1197
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
especially when you have such a name behind...

1198
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Why didn't they do the symphony for everything?

1199
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
It probably cost a lot of money. I don't know.

1200
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:27,000
But I do know Final Fantasy, even though nothing was wrong with Nobui Matsu per se,

1201
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
they've used some newer, some different composers lately,

1202
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
and there's been some great music still produced for Final Fantasy.

1203
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Especially in the case of Final Fantasy XIV.

1204
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Y'all know I love XIV's soundtrack.

1205
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
XIV is doing it right.

1206
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Dragon Quest XI is doing it wrong.

1207
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
So, anyway.

1208
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Bobby wanted you to review Ready Player One.

1209
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Oh, yeah. Okay.

1210
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Yeah, well, and this is for your benefit, too.

1211
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Okay, so going back to Dragon Con, I stayed an extra day this year

1212
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
so that I wouldn't be rushing back on Labor Day.

1213
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
And this way I also got to see Bobby in Jennifer's house

1214
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
because I didn't get to see that when I was out there for the wedding.

1215
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
And I think I'm allowed to talk about this.

1216
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
If not, sorry.

1217
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
But I think he did say I could talk about his theater.

1218
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,000
So he actually converted part of his basement into a theater, and it's nice.

1219
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
He has 4K projection.

1220
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
He has the couches that Jamie has in her house,

1221
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,000
with the big old cup holders and things like that that are movie recliner seats.

1222
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
He has that, but he has them on the steps

1223
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
so that he actually has a back row and a front row.

1224
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
So it's like a movie theater, so it's like a six-seat movie theater.

1225
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
And so he actually played a little bit of Horza Horizon 3

1226
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
on that 4K projector on his Xbox One X.

1227
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
And I was like, this is hot.

1228
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
This is really hot.

1229
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
This is the way to game. This is awesome.

1230
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
So, of course, we had to watch something.

1231
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Let's put that movie theater to use, right?

1232
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Bobby has a guest over. Let's do something.

1233
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
So we decided to watch Ready Player One because I still hadn't seen it.

1234
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I will give you this, Loki. It didn't suck. I didn't hate it.

1235
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
It's kind of like how you felt about Nintendo's press conference.

1236
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I didn't hate it.

1237
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
It was fine. I wasn't like, oh my god.

1238
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
But I was like, okay, for a big popcorn, fun, dumb movie,

1239
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I was like, it was cool. I was into it.

1240
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
It's not going to win any Oscars.

1241
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Of course not.

1242
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
But for dumb, fun popcorn, it was cool.

1243
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Some of those scenes, the graphics, the visuals,

1244
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
that racing scene right in the very beginning, that was really impressive.

1245
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
They did a lot of stuff with that that was really cool.

1246
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
It was a long movie. That was one thing I noticed.

1247
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
It really started to be long.

1248
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,000
There were some issues with the plot, but nothing too much.

1249
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Well, they kind of abridged it from the book.

1250
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I heard they really changed it.

1251
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
That's not really an excuse, though, because the author of the book

1252
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
also kind of helped write the screenplay.

1253
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Bobby points out that his studio, and I always forget this,

1254
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,000
his theater has Dolby Atmos sound with two speakers in the ceiling,

1255
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
so the race sounds amazing. It did.

1256
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
That's probably part of what really made it.

1257
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Now, here's the thing.

1258
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Going back, we made the right choice,

1259
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
and we really do need to watch Ready Player One.

1260
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Here's the thing.

1261
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
If I do this again next year, and I stay an extra day next year,

1262
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
not that I'm inviting myself to Bobby's house next year,

1263
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
but there's a part of me that says he probably wouldn't care.

1264
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I feel like the movie we should have watched is Tron Legacy.

1265
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Well, yes.

1266
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
So maybe that'll have to be next year's selection.

1267
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I don't know, assuming there's no...

1268
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Because now I'm like, oh, wow, I wonder what...

1269
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
You know, thinking about racing scenes and sound and everything like that,

1270
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I'm like, oh, God, Tron Legacy would have been so badass.

1271
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Anyway.

1272
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Oh, Bobby Blackwolf says,

1273
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I only have Tron on DVD, and DVDs don't look the best on that screen,

1274
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
even upscaled.

1275
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Tron Legacy doesn't have the Atmos sound mix,

1276
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
but I'd still use 5.1.

1277
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
And he's officially invited me in chat to stay again after DragonCon next year.

1278
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I have the original Tron on Blu-ray and the Tron Legacy on Blu-ray.

1279
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Yeah, I was gonna say, I could actually bring my...

1280
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I do have Tron, because I bought that big pack...

1281
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Yeah, the collector's edition.

1282
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
That had, like, all the Trons in it.

1283
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
All two of them.

1284
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Well, no, I said all the Trons, because it had the original Tron,

1285
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Tron Legacy, and it had the Tron Legacy 3D disc in it, too.

1286
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Yes.

1287
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
They were on separate discs.

1288
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
The 2D and 3D were separate.

1289
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Still haven't watched that yet on my PlayStation VR.

1290
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Yeah.

1291
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
So, all right.

1292
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
So, anyway.

1293
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Where were we?

1294
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
So, yes, that was another thing I got to do while I was visiting Bobby.

1295
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
So, other games.

1296
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
We still have news to get into.

1297
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
This is what happens when we miss two weeks.

1298
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Sorry.

1299
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Anyway.

1300
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I've been playing Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch as well, continuing on those.

1301
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
That's all I need to say about that.

1302
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I've been playing the new World of Warcraft expansion.

1303
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I don't know what the fuck came over me, but I was just like...

1304
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Final Fantasy XIV is kind of in a lull right now.

1305
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
There are big patches until Tuesday, and, like,

1306
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I'm not really playing online with anyone in that game right now,

1307
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
and all I see on Twitter are all my friends playing World of War...

1308
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Wow, what the fuck?

1309
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I'll just renew World of Warcraft.

1310
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I'll play that for a little bit.

1311
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
And the expansion is fine.

1312
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
But, like, the Horde zone that I'm playing in, Zandalar or whatever,

1313
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
with the big, like, Mayan temple-inspired thing,

1314
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
it's a bitch to navigate,

1315
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
and I hate that you don't have flying in a zone like that.

1316
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
That's my, like, I know that's, like, a weird criticism,

1317
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
but that's, like, my one criticism so far,

1318
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
is that, like, I hate the zone design.

1319
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I guess that's the criticism.

1320
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I hate the zone design of that zone.

1321
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Maybe it gets better.

1322
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Everybody tells me the Alliance one is way better.

1323
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I mean, I don't know how much of that is faction bias or whatever,

1324
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
but I'm just saying, since I started with the Horde character,

1325
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I wasn't too impressed with that particular zone.

1326
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
But what I am impressed with is that I'm, like, dang,

1327
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
like, here's a cinematic, there's a cinematic,

1328
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
here's another cinematic.

1329
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I remember when, like, the WoW cinematic was your reward

1330
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
for, like, beating the Lich King, the final boss in the game.

1331
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
You got a cinematic, and you got your one cinematic.

1332
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Now it's, like, dang, they have one, like, for every little thing that happens.

1333
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
And I thought the scenarios that really explain the backstory

1334
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
about why we're on these new islands

1335
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
and why the Horde and Alliance are super fighting again,

1336
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
I thought that was really well done as well.

1337
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Except the one thing I don't understand,

1338
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
and maybe this is just because I didn't play Legion to completion,

1339
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
so I will fault myself for this a little bit,

1340
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
but one thing I kind of didn't understand is, like,

1341
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:27,000
why did Sylvanas just all of a sudden become, like, a crazy person?

1342
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Like, I understand maybe she was, like, a little crazy before,

1343
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
but why is she all of a sudden, like, really fucking me?

1344
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,000
It kind of feels like a rehash of what happened to Garrosh in Pandaria,

1345
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
and so that's the only reason why I'm kind of calling it out,

1346
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
is I feel like I'm, like, this feels like territory we've been to before.

1347
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Is Sylvanas going to be the last boss of the expansion?

1348
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Because if so, that's kind of dippy, because we've seen that before.

1349
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
So we'll see, though. That's a very minor read.

1350
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I don't know. We'll see how long I stick with it,

1351
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
but so far I guess I'm having a good enough time with it. We'll see.

1352
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Anyway, that's it. That's it for my gaming week.

1353
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Okay, we're going to get into news, but I need to go over one other topic.

1354
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
So this is, not everybody's heard this yet,

1355
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
so one thing, we did announce a DragonCon at one of the panels,

1356
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
and so we talked about it a little bit in Discord,

1357
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
which you can join our Discord anytime at vognetwork.com slash Discord,

1358
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
and it was on Twitter and so forth,

1359
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
but I realize there are many of you out there

1360
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
who only download the Orange Rounds Radio podcast every week,

1361
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
and you don't necessarily interact with the show a lot outside of listening to it,

1362
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
which is cool. Like, I'm super happy that you're listening,

1363
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
so thank you, thank you for downloading the show and just giving it a try in the first place.

1364
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
So I realize there's a lot of you that haven't heard the news, so what is the news?

1365
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
The news is that Orange Rounds Radio is going to be moving a little bit

1366
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
by the end of the year. I don't have a date yet.

1367
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
It's not, vognetwork is still a thing, so it's not that kind of move.

1368
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,000
What is going to be changing is that we're no longer going to be using Shoutcast

1369
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:53,000
as the platform that we do our live presentation on Sunday nights.

1370
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
So really, since 2002,

1371
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
this is something that hasn't changed since 2002 when OLR started.

1372
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:07,000
For the past 16 years, you used Shoutcast, a Winamp-type plug-in, to do this show.

1373
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I mean, technically in the live 365 years we had a live,

1374
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
but it was a fancier Shoutcast plug-in. That's all it was, okay?

1375
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
So we've used Shoutcast to deliver this show for 16 years.

1376
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
And y'all know if you do the same thing the same way all the time,

1377
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
you're going to get the same results.

1378
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
And we're not getting a lot of new listeners to OLR.

1379
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
You know, we get some, and I'm very thankful.

1380
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Some of you take to heart what I say at the end of every show,

1381
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
and you do tell a friend or two about the show.

1382
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Some people find us through social media or when we're live.

1383
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:39,000
But we haven't really, really expanded our audience a lot in several years.

1384
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
And so I think in order to do that,

1385
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I think we're going to have to really evaluate is Shoutcast really the best platform,

1386
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
or is there another thing that could give us greater visibility?

1387
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Is there another thing that could really expand the reach and accessibility

1388
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
of something like OLR and Bobby Black Wolf and Anime Jam Session

1389
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
and the other live shows that are on VOG Network?

1390
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,000
And so we made a decision that we're going to change from a Shoutcast show

1391
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
to a Twitch show. That's right, Twitch.

1392
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
So same thing that a lot of people stream their video games on,

1393
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
but you also know they have an IRL channel,

1394
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
and they do channels where people will tape live shows.

1395
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Sometimes these are like podcasts.

1396
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Sometimes it's the host kind of BSing with their audience for a while.

1397
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
That's the type of thing that it is.

1398
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,000
So instead of using Shoutcast to deliver the show, it's going to be Twitch.

1399
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
However, there's always going to be people,

1400
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
especially after you've done something one way for 16 years,

1401
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
there's always going to be people that are like,

1402
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,000
but change, but I like the old way. This is what works for me.

1403
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Well, here's the thing. We want to try something new.

1404
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
And so this is going to be a new thing that we're trying.

1405
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,000
But I don't want you to feel like the show is going to change. It's not.

1406
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Yes, there will be video available on Twitch.

1407
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
You will see video of us doing a radio show.

1408
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
So I want to make that very clear.

1409
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Orange Launch Radio is not becoming...

1410
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
No!

1411
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Said Jamie.

1412
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Actually, Jamie, we wouldn't have done this if Jamie wasn't cool with it.

1413
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
She's fine with it, you know?

1414
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,000
And remember, y'all, we've already done this.

1415
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,000
We did this when Justin TV was a thing.

1416
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
And OLR, like the show that you're hearing, didn't change.

1417
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
It was just that, oh, you could watch it on Justin TV.

1418
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I need some better lighting in here.

1419
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Yeah, this room's going to change a little bit before that happens.

1420
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
But we'll get there.

1421
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Anyway, my point is that because I don't want people to be freaked out.

1422
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
They're like, oh my God, Orange Launch Radio is going to change.

1423
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
It's a TV thing now. I can't watch it.

1424
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
That's okay. We're still recording a podcast.

1425
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
And it's still going to be the same podcast that you're used to.

1426
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Because I'm very aware that there's some of you out there who are blind

1427
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
or have sight impairments and so forth.

1428
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
And so when I say that we're moving to a video-based platform,

1429
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
you might get a little nervous.

1430
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,000
But I want to try to ease your fears a little bit saying that the way we produce

1431
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
and what we're talking about with this show, that's not going to change.

1432
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
The way we put together OLR and all that, that's not going to change.

1433
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
It's just like our chat room will be a Twitch chat room.

1434
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,000
And instead of using TuneIn to listen to Orange Launch Radio,

1435
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,000
you will use the Twitch app, which is available on your phone,

1436
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
available on your PlayStation, your Xbox.

1437
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
It's available a lot of places.

1438
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
So that's another reason why Twitch is pretty appealing.

1439
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
So I hope you will at least give it a shot.

1440
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I don't have a date for that when that's all going to happen yet.

1441
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
For those of you that don't interact with us live,

1442
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
you only download the podcast every week and check it out.

1443
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
I really don't think for you anything's going to change at all.

1444
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I really don't because it's still going to be the same show.

1445
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
It's just that instead of being shoutcast on Sunday night,

1446
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
it's going to be on Twitch Sunday night.

1447
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
That's the only change.

1448
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
But I think with a lot of the discoverability features that Twitch has in,

1449
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
a lot of the features when it comes to,

1450
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
some of you have been generous enough to say,

1451
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I would love to help you guys pay your bills.

1452
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I would love to be able to help Jamie buy more games

1453
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
or help fund Loki's project.

1454
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Obviously I'm being a little bit facetious,

1455
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
but you guys have been kind enough to say,

1456
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I want to support the show financially.

1457
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
And I've always been very skittish about things like Patreon

1458
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
because I don't want you paying upfront

1459
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
for a service that we then have to deliver on.

1460
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Because, for example, last week we had to cancel the show due to illness.

1461
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
If you'd paid money for that show,

1462
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I'm sure most of you would be understanding,

1463
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
but there would be people that would feel a little bit like,

1464
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I paid for something I didn't get.

1465
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
But the nice thing about the Twitch and the subscriptions

1466
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
and the bits and things like that is that you can tip us if you want.

1467
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
You don't have to.

1468
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
If you want, you can do that.

1469
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
I will not be interrupting the show to read bit donate.

1470
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
We have an idea on how we're going to do that.

1471
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
We will acknowledge those of you that choose to do that.

1472
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
We're just not going to do it the way other Twitch streamers have done it.

1473
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
And I'll leave it at that.

1474
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Or I should say traditionally do it.

1475
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
We'll leave it at that.

1476
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
But it's because, again, the radio show has not changed.

1477
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
It's not going to stop every five seconds to say,

1478
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
oh, thanks for the bits.

1479
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Act F to appreciate it.

1480
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
I'll still read chat comments because we've always done that.

1481
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
But I just won't stop to read those types of things.

1482
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,000
But also the subscriptions will hopefully allow us to give you something new

1483
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
that you haven't been able to get before.

1484
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Again, I want to stress you're not going to have to pay

1485
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:18,000
for OLR's audio podcast feed that you've always gotten for free.

1486
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
That's not going to change.

1487
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
You guys know I'm not going to do that to you.

1488
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
But it will allow us to offer something additional to subscribers.

1489
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:29,000
And if you use your deductive thinking to think about what is going to be different

1490
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:34,000
on Twitch versus Shoutcast, you can probably piece together what might be extra.

1491
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
I'm not wearing any pants.

1492
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,000
You'd probably be correct on what you're going to get.

1493
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
But I'll leave it at that because, officially,

1494
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
we haven't worked all that out yet, officially.

1495
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Anyway, I've been turning away from chat because I haven't been totally paying attention.

1496
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
I want to read some of the comments here at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1497
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
bonds006 says, I listened to the music stream.

1498
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Not as much now, but I used it a lot in the past.

1499
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I respect that.

1500
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,000
And I'm sorry that we are having to sunset that.

1501
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I will point out the radio costs us a lot.

1502
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000
The music stuff is in a gray area.

1503
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
I'm not sure we should be playing.

1504
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
I'm not sure that music feed should exist.

1505
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,000
So another part of the reason we're doing this is to get us out of that legal gray area

1506
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,000
because that will also enable us to do some extra things that we've wanted to do.

1507
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
And I hope you guys will understand.

1508
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Let's see.

1509
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Other comments in chat at live.vognetwork.com.

1510
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
rageator in chat says, FYI, although I can't tip very often because poor,

1511
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I tip people from time to time on Twitch and I can get bits easily due to watching ads.

1512
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Yeah, exactly.

1513
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Again, this isn't about money.

1514
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
This is not about money.

1515
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
It's not about money.

1516
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
It's not about money.

1517
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Because if we haven't made money in 16 years and we're still doing it.

1518
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
It's not like we've started a Kickstarter or anything.

1519
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Exactly.

1520
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
We can't do this show.

1521
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Here's the thing.

1522
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
So here's the thing.

1523
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
If you want to watch ads and tip us biddies, that is so awesome.

1524
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
I'm so thankful and cool.

1525
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
But you know what you can do on Twitch for free?

1526
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Hosts, making clips and sharing those clips on social media.

1527
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:10,000
And all of that will be worth just as much as biddies, if not more, honestly.

1528
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,000
So please don't feel any type of financial obligation to this show.

1529
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Puba in chat says, centralized feed, chat and financial support.

1530
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
And all in all, a bigger platform for exposure.

1531
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
This is a no brainer.

1532
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
So happy for you all.

1533
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Thank you, Puba.

1534
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
That's definitely in the right direction as to why we're making this change in the first place.

1535
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Let's see.

1536
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Also trying to get some of the other comments here in chat at live.vognetwork.com.

1537
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Tiger Conchet says, I'm using a service called Restream which allows me to broadcast on multiple platforms all at once.

1538
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
So I'd have a stream on Twitch, Mixer, YouTube, Gaming, even Periscope.

1539
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,000
The plan is to go to Twitch affiliate status with VOG Network.

1540
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,000
And so the affiliate contract would not allow that.

1541
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
We could put clips on YouTube and things like that.

1542
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I am going to, I think it's safe for me to tell you, that is not in our plan.

1543
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
We will not be putting today, it's not in our plan today.

1544
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
I'm a never say never type of person.

1545
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:11,000
But we may do delayed clips on those services in the future, but that's not the plan.

1546
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
The plan is to go all in on Twitch.

1547
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
For now.

1548
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
And if that doesn't prove to be the right thing to do, then we might change it later.

1549
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,000
But again, the Twitch affiliate agreements wouldn't allow us to use the restreaming thing.

1550
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
It's only going to be on Twitch.

1551
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Let's see, one other thing, let's see.

1552
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,000
TigerClawnChat says on Twitch you can do reruns, so if you did a live show you can have Twitch rebroadcast it since those are archived.

1553
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
You're right, we could.

1554
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
So, anyway.

1555
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Alright, thank you guys for your flexibility.

1556
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I will give you a date on that.

1557
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
We're targeting by the end of the year, but as Loki hinted there, we have to make a lot of changes to studio.

1558
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:52,000
We have to buy some new equipment, which my husband is currently unemployed, so that's a bit of a challenge.

1559
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
But we are looking at hopefully in the next couple months we'll be there.

1560
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
So the goal is by the end of the year.

1561
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
So stay tuned to all the latest updates.

1562
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
We'll be updating folks in our Discord as well as social media.

1563
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Again, because I can't stress this enough and I don't want people to freak out over change,

1564
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:16,000
if you're listening to this on your podcast in your car on the way to work because you download this show on Monday morning,

1565
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I really don't think anything is going to change for you.

1566
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
We're still going to just put out the show as we always have,

1567
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:28,000
as we did when we were broadcasting on Justin TV for a short while that most of you probably forgot or didn't know about.

1568
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:34,000
It's just that we're kind of going back to that a little bit, but this time it's all in on that.

1569
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Anyway, there you go.

1570
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, small steps forward, progress will come.

1571
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Yes, I agree. That is a good note to end on.

1572
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Alright, let's move on from there.

1573
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Enough meta stuff about us.

1574
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
We're only like an hour and 20 minutes into the show and we've only talked about that in Nintendo Direct.

1575
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
But there's other stuff going on, right, Loki?

1576
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Yes, there is. In fact, Nintendo Direct in Japan was a little bit different as well.

1577
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,000
In fact, one game that's going to be coming to Nintendo Switch in Japan is Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

1578
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,000
What? You may say, how can that possibly run on a Switch?

1579
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Well, it's going to be a cloud version of the game.

1580
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:17,000
So basically what's going to happen is you're going to be able to stream it to the game console using, I guess, their cloud service.

1581
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:26,000
And so that way you'll be able to get the same visuals that you would see elsewhere, but, you know, on a less powerful platform.

1582
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:33,000
They're partnering with, I guess, a Taiwanese game streaming company called Ubitis Game Cloud.

1583
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:39,000
It's going to cost players $20 to rent the game and stream it for 180 days.

1584
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
And all you have to do is download the 45 megabyte client.

1585
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
So, interesting that they're doing that.

1586
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Interesting that they didn't announce it here.

1587
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Is this something about Japan's internet structure versus ours?

1588
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
I think theirs is better than ours.

1589
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Well, I wouldn't doubt that for a minute, but it's kind of interesting that they're focusing on Japan with that.

1590
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I think it's a really clever, cool little workaround.

1591
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Honestly, I know this isn't the popular concept, but gaming's kind of going this direction.

1592
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Future consoles, we've already heard rumblings that Microsoft may put out.

1593
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:23,000
We don't know for sure, but Microsoft, in addition to whatever Xbox 2 Y console they're going to do in the future,

1594
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:32,000
they may put out a very bare bones, there's been a lot of rumors about a bare bones streaming device that only does the streaming type of stuff.

1595
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
And playing games in the cloud and all that.

1596
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
And that's, you guys, it's 2018 and the Phantom is finally here.

1597
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
The Phantom console, finally. Finally.

1598
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
It's just so ahead of its time.

1599
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
It's just ahead of its time.

1600
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Well, we laugh, but where's the lie?

1601
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Do you think that this is where games are? We're going to be playing games in the cloud.

1602
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:58,000
I mean, sure, there's latency issues and things like that today, but internet's only going to get better, Loki.

1603
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Well, at least I hope my internet gets better by Tuesday when the tech comes so I can get back to live streaming, but anyway.

1604
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Yeah, I mean, what I would see with the new Xbox console is it not necessarily going to be something that is its own standalone streaming thing.

1605
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:23,000
I could see them integrating it into TVs like you would see with the Roku device, like my TV has a built in Roku device.

1606
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
And you can just stream it with that.

1607
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Or it could be an app that works with those devices so that you can stream through that and then you just sync your Bluetooth, Xbox One controller and away you go.

1608
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
So I could see something like that.

1609
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Be interested in seeing how popular this is. I'm kind of curious to see how it works out.

1610
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
It looked cool based on the demo and stuff.

1611
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:55,000
So be interested to see what other games could come to the platform. And that might be an option for, you know, like Battlefield and Call of Duty and stuff like that.

1612
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Going to chat at live.voguenetwork.com, YYR says, get that streaming crap out of my video games. As someone who mostly plays arcade style fast paced games, I don't ever want to stream them.

1613
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Okay, sure. No, I get that. And like you can't stream music based games or any of that stuff. Like I totally get that.

1614
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:22,000
But at the same time, what if the internet and all this cloud technology, what if the latency gets just as good on that as it does from the wireless controller to your television is today?

1615
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Because at the rate the technology is multiplying, I'm just saying, like, you know, we're not there yet. So it's tough to visualize.

1616
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:36,000
But I imagine what in 10 years, the latency between your wireless controller and your TV is going to be just as fast as latency on your internet.

1617
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:46,000
And so some of these issues will get better, I think, you know, but then again, you know, as I'm experiencing firsthand this week, a lot of that falls in the hands of somebody else.

1618
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:58,000
And when that fails, it can be very frustrating. So I also can understand why people may not want to go all in on the cloud because maybe their internet is not going to be that reliable. So I get that.

1619
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,000
And they're doing all they can right now to fight making it any better.

1620
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Yeah. And YYR does point out there's a lot of folks in rural communities who are stuck with crappy internet. So that's true.

1621
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,000
So maybe this, you know, cloud streaming thing won't be for everybody. I just kind of feel like, I don't know.

1622
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
It's a neat experiment. Let's see if it works.

1623
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Yeah. Even in rural areas, they have satellite. And yes, that's very expensive. But you know what? Mobile phones were really expensive for every minute when they first came out.

1624
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:39,000
And you know, now everybody, like everybody has an iPhone or an Android in their pocket, almost there. I shouldn't say everybody, but you know, you're not paying for that technology, which you used to in the mid 90s, which for all intents and purposes was not that long ago.

1625
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:46,000
That's kind of that's kind of where I'm going with this is that technology is going so fast. And it's hard to visualize where it's going to be in 10 years.

1626
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:57,000
But like, if you consider the ground we've made in the next 20 years, I don't think it's unreasonable to think that even people in rural communities will get fast internet out of thin air in 20 years.

1627
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Because look at where we've come from 20 years ago to today. I guess. I guess that's my point.

1628
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Bobby Blackwell points out, excuse me, the budget phone X phone iPhone XR is $750. Well, that's why people are paying the monthly fees at this point to lease them like they're their cars or something like that.

1629
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:29,000
But at the same time, get an I'm sure many people would say get an Android and that's fine. I don't like the whole anti iPhone or anti Android stuff. I think both having both is good.

1630
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Get a comparable Android device then if you want. I just iPhone 7 is going to be cheaper and cheaper.

1631
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Or I just like what am I really getting for that premium price? And that's not just Apple. That's just like any phone.

1632
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:53,000
I mean, I love my iPhone 10. I really do. I'm not going to buy one of these new phones. It's not enough of an upgrade from what I already have to pay that price.

1633
01:25:53,000 --> 01:26:00,000
If I was still rocking my iPhone 6 Plus, then maybe I would, you know, which I was last year when I bought the 10, then maybe I would look into that.

1634
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:05,000
But anyway, this is this is not the mobile phone podcast. We have plenty of other gaming stuff to get into.

1635
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:10,000
But so would you would you be open to playing more games through streaming Loki?

1636
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:18,000
No, because I've tried that even locally through my network to just play games streaming from my PlayStation 4.

1637
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Although I haven't tried it with the pro, so I'm not sure if that works any better now, but it has not been a satisfactory experience.

1638
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:35,000
And so I will not be doing that in the future. Yeah. Although I may try it now with the pro that I think of it because my wife doesn't really watch Netflix all the time.

1639
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:45,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase PEAK.

1640
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Well, let me move on to a different type of streaming. So I've talked a lot about Twitch, Twitch, Twitch.

1641
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:54,000
But of course, Mixer is a player out there and, you know, Mixer's continuing to do their stuff through Microsoft.

1642
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:04,000
And this is something pretty cool that sets Mixer apart, is that you are getting now in-game bonuses for Mixer streams for Forza Horizon 4.

1643
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:14,000
No, the game isn't out yet, but the demo is. And so if you stream the demo online, the streamer and the viewer actually get in-game rewards from this.

1644
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Influence is kind of the scoring, the currency sort of in Forza Horizon.

1645
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
You know, as you do tricks, you get more influence, you get fans and stuff like that.

1646
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Yeah. One way you can get influence is broadcasting and watching broadcast through Mixer. That's pretty cool.

1647
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Now, we have seen, I mean, it isn't brand new to have games influenced by live streams on Twitch and Mixer and other platforms.

1648
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:43,000
But, you know, Forza Horizon 4 is a pretty big title, a pretty, you know, big like first party game to get something like this.

1649
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:49,000
And I think it's really cool. So anyway, as long, everything has to be linked to your Xbox gamer tag.

1650
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:56,000
And you get influence points every five minutes that you watch a feed. If you're streaming it, you get every two minutes.

1651
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,000
The game itself, again, is out on September 28th. It will continue this.

1652
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
But the demo that's going on right now is giving you some of like the pre-rewards with this.

1653
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:10,000
So, you know, giving more reason to stream and kind of participate together. I think that's really cool.

1654
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Something that Forza is also doing, Forza Horizon 4, would be James Bond DLC.

1655
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:24,000
That's right. There's going to be a Forza Horizon 4 pack that will bring ten of Bond's iconic cars to the game.

1656
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:30,000
We don't know the exact cars yet, but we do know the best of Bond pack is going to be available when the game comes out.

1657
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,000
So assuming there will be an Aston Martin and all this stuff.

1658
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Oh no, we do know the list. We don't know the price. So we do know some of them.

1659
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:44,000
So we know, of course, Aston Martin, the 1964 DB5 and the 2015 DB10 will be there.

1660
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
The BMW Z8 from The World Is Not Enough will be there as well.

1661
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:52,000
So some of the iconic Bond cars will be there. We just don't know the exact price yet.

1662
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:57,000
So, pretty cool. Yeah, I'm super hyped for Forza Horizon 4.

1663
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:01,000
As if I didn't have enough to play right now, but here it is. September's here.

1664
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:07,000
And now the ramp up to the end of the year begins where there's going to be stuff like every single week that's going to be something you want to play.

1665
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
So, anyway.

1666
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, RageNator in chat says,

1667
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:18,000
I hear that Mixer has been having major growing pains and stability issues to the point where streams have been totally unwatchable.

1668
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:26,000
I haven't heard that, but I haven't used Mixer a lot. I did randomly watch it on my Xbox One the other night.

1669
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
I was watching some of the stuff that Microsoft kind of puts together themselves.

1670
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,000
They were actually doing a program about World of Warcraft, which I thought was interesting.

1671
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
So, I mean, it's not like they're going to cover PlayStation games,

1672
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,000
but I don't think they're going to ignore that, you know, Nintendo is out there,

1673
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,000
especially when they've got these Minecraft play together things going on.

1674
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:48,000
And, you know, PC. I mean, Microsoft still has a lot to win in the PC space.

1675
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:53,000
So, it doesn't surprise me that they're talking about World of Warcraft for Windows, right?

1676
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:57,000
So, all right. Anyway, moving on. Loki.

1677
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:06,000
All right. Well, speaking of Microsoft, one of their properties, Alan Wake, is, I guess, expected to become a TV show.

1678
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
So, that's different.

1679
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:13,000
I haven't actually played Alan Wake. I know a little bit about it,

1680
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:18,000
but neat to see that it's actually being turned into that.

1681
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:26,000
So, I guess I'm going to continue off where the story, I guess, ended

1682
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:32,000
and take place along with the inhabitants of Bright Falls.

1683
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,000
They said the story of the original game is our starting point,

1684
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:41,000
the seed of which we will expand our bigger story that we're exploring in the show.

1685
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
We'll be expanding the lore of this crazy dark universe

1686
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:49,000
and diving deeper into certain aspects of it than the game ever did.

1687
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Not only that, but through the years, we've worked on multiple game concepts

1688
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,000
and stories for Alan Wake's world that have never seen the light of day.

1689
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:04,000
All of this material will function as the potential source material for the show.

1690
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Neat.

1691
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Yeah, it seems a little late, seeing as this game was a little while ago.

1692
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,000
I don't know if maybe there'll be a new Alan Wake game or something to kind of go with it.

1693
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:21,000
But, I mean, I felt like I was playing a TV show when I played the game.

1694
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,000
I think it is a game a lot of people slept on that's really good.

1695
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
It was an episodic game.

1696
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:31,000
It was very Twin Peaks-ish, and it even had its whole show-within-a-show type of thing that was going on.

1697
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I really would check this out. Why not? I think it would be very cool.

1698
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Alright, will you watch the Alan Wake TV show?

1699
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Probably not, just because I've never played the game.

1700
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
I mean, I don't know.

1701
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
You don't need to see the game to watch the show.

1702
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Maybe. I don't know.

1703
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Alright. Anyway.

1704
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Also, talking about streaming with Twitch and Microsoft.

1705
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Finally, a redesigned Twitch app for the Xbox One is on the way.

1706
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Some people were wondering were they going to bother because Microsoft is obviously going in on Mixer quite a bit.

1707
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,000
But, nope, the answer is there are still people that are using Twitch on their Xbox One.

1708
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Hello, I'm one of them, actually. I use Twitch a lot on my Xbox One.

1709
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,000
So I'm happy that they're finally updating with the PlayStation 4 version.

1710
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Right now, it's only part of the Insiders test group.

1711
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,000
So you do have to be in the Insiders test group, which I think I'm in, but I don't have this.

1712
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
I think I haven't opted into it yet.

1713
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:27,000
I think you have to launch the whole actual, like, Insider app and then enable it.

1714
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
So, maybe that's what I need to do.

1715
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:35,000
But, some of the things that will be in this will be live video previews so that you can see the live streams while you browse.

1716
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Which, the desktop version of this does this automatically.

1717
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Sometimes annoyingly so.

1718
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Like, right when you go to the Twitch front page, you get somebody's stream and let's just hope they're not screaming.

1719
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,000
You can also see chat on offline videos, which is really cool.

1720
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Especially since, you know, maybe this pre-recorded stream thing is something I'm going to have to do for a little bit until these upload issues get fixed.

1721
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,000
So, the fact that you can do the chat after the fact is pretty cool.

1722
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:03,000
And, yeah, just do some improved stability and some additions there on the Twitch app.

1723
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:08,000
So it's going to kind of bring it up to parity with the PlayStation 4 version, to which I say good.

1724
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:13,000
And I hope they're also future-proofing it by putting the tag system into it and some of that stuff.

1725
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Because the communities are not in the Xbox One version right now.

1726
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
And I don't think it's in the PlayStation 4 version either.

1727
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,000
And that kind of bothers me because I do like to look in community tags a lot.

1728
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Like Small Streamer, Twitch, Unity, those types of tags.

1729
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
I like to look in those a lot to try to find new people.

1730
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
And you can't do that on the consoles today.

1731
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:36,000
So I do hope, you know, we know that those are going away in favor of the tagging system, which is going to be similar.

1732
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:41,000
I really hope that the apps will have the tagging stuff built into it.

1733
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
That would make me very happy.

1734
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Anyhow, a few more stories before we get into the Classic Game of the Week.

1735
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Loki.

1736
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
One game I forgot to mention that I did play this week, Pokémon GO.

1737
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
I'm playing quite a bit of that.

1738
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:58,000
But you could be playing even more of that in some of these regions throughout the world.

1739
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Brazil and Korea, they have opened up the ability for players to nominate new Pokéstops in those regions.

1740
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,000
I'm guessing because there isn't a lot of them there.

1741
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:22,000
But apparently they said for level 40 trainers in Brazil and Korea, you'll be able to submit different locations and objects through the app settings menu.

1742
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:28,000
To actually pin locations that could possibly become Pokéstops in the future.

1743
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:33,000
And eventually they will open it up wider as they roll it out.

1744
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:41,000
I'm assuming kind of like they did with Ingress where it will be available for lower level trainers.

1745
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
And then for more regions I'm assuming.

1746
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,000
So this is kind of just a little bit of a test bench.

1747
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:57,000
And then right now they're saying, of course we've seen different sponsored Pokéstops, Sprint and Starbucks.

1748
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:02,000
But they're hoping that according to the CEO.

1749
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Fostering these moments of discovery and exploration is the foundation of what we do.

1750
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:17,000
The world is a big place and the only way we can find the very best locations for inclusion in our game is with the help of its players.

1751
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:23,000
So you ready for me to say something that not everybody is going to like?

1752
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,000
As an Ingress player I'm not really a big fan of this at all.

1753
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Here's the thing, before you come at me with your pitchfork and torches.

1754
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:36,000
I realize that a lot of rural players, and I'm not trying to be elitist.

1755
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
So please let me explain myself here.

1756
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Because you know I hate that elitism and stuff so let me explain why.

1757
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Ingress is a very player versus player game.

1758
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
It is extremely player versus player.

1759
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:52,000
To the point where people on the other team, I don't really interact with an awful lot.

1760
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Because if they know where I am, they know the targets I can hit.

1761
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,000
And it's the same thing with them because that is how PvP that game is.

1762
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Those of you playing Pokémon GO, Mystic versus Valor versus Instinct for all the shit talking that goes on amongst those teams.

1763
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
That is not PvP.

1764
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
In fact it's quite the opposite.

1765
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:15,000
You need people of the other team to help you out, to knock you out of gyms if you want your 50 coins.

1766
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Like if the people are not there to fight you, you're not going to get your own rewards.

1767
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,000
So this is the reason why.

1768
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:31,000
I am completely fine with new Pokéstops being added into Pokémon GO and only Pokémon GO from the Pokémon GO players.

1769
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,000
I do not want to see those Pokéstops become Ingress portals.

1770
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Because since you know, and keep in mind I'm not just a level 16 Ingress player which is the max.

1771
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:47,000
I'm a level 39 which is one level below max Pokémon GO player.

1772
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:52,000
If somebody puts a Pokéstop on their house, I mean it doesn't really hurt anything.

1773
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,000
That's fine, it's a Pokéstop, whatever.

1774
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
I mean some might say game balance blah blah blah.

1775
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Whatever, it's not as big of a deal as a portal in Ingress going on your house.

1776
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,000
And now people are going to be like attacking, trying to field from it.

1777
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:11,000
And they're doing strategic things where it's like I'm going to manipulate the fuck out of this portal because I live on top of it and I don't even have to like travel at all.

1778
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Because that is already a problem in some regards today.

1779
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:20,000
And that problem is only going to get worse if we get shitty Pokéstop submissions in Ingress.

1780
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
You know what I mean?

1781
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
So again, and I want to make myself very clear.

1782
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:29,000
I am fine if Pokémon GO players create Pokéstops that are only in Pokémon GO.

1783
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:40,000
But since they're having the Ingress OPR system review these, I'm a little nervous that they're going to cross over into Ingress at some point.

1784
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Now, the way it is now, I'm still okay with it. Why?

1785
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Because the Ingress players who understand the PvP, who are not going to allow these portals to go into places where they're going to have portal battles and so forth going on.

1786
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,000
They're going to continue to not allow that stuff.

1787
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
And so hopefully that will fix some of the real problem.

1788
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:06,000
But if they allow Pokémon players to start doing the review and those things go into Ingress, Ingress is going to be ruined.

1789
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Mark my words.

1790
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,000
So maybe I'm just being that old codger that fears change.

1791
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Ingress 2.0.

1792
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Yeah, but it's still the same game.

1793
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
So anyway, that's just my take on that.

1794
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
And I'm sure you know what?

1795
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Many of you don't give a shit about Ingress.

1796
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
That's cool.

1797
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
But please recognize that I do.

1798
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
And I made friends through the game.

1799
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,000
And so yes, I really do not want to see my game get screwed up.

1800
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,000
And we also, right now we don't know how the Harry Potter game is going to play.

1801
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
No, we don't.

1802
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Because if that's very PvP.

1803
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Yeah, it very well could be.

1804
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Then you're going to regret some of these decisions and stops.

1805
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Yeah, you really are.

1806
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
So anyway.

1807
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
We'll play, I bet, four way PvP too with that game.

1808
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,000
I do think though, the way they've implemented it now,

1809
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
OPR is already so backlogged.

1810
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,000
I can access Ingress OPR and I can review portals and stuff.

1811
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
And I have.

1812
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Actually I think I have 960 agreements last I checked.

1813
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
So I've reviewed a lot of portals.

1814
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
I've seen some of the bullshit people submit.

1815
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I've seen toilets.

1816
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
I've seen cats.

1817
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:15,000
I've seen the picture of somebody's hand saying I'm just testing this to see if it works.

1818
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
I've seen all the bullshit in there.

1819
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:21,000
And I've seen some really rad stuff too.

1820
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:25,000
And I've seen stuff in the middle of fucking nowhere that's pretty awesome.

1821
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,000
I've seen trail markers on places I probably would never go.

1822
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
And sign boards that explain a vista point in places I'll probably.

1823
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
You know, that's all rad.

1824
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,000
And that's the type of stuff I hope to continue to see and all that stuff and so forth.

1825
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
But anyway.

1826
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Where was I going with all this?

1827
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Where was the old man going?

1828
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Don't fuck up our shit.

1829
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:47,000
No, it's that they don't really give a lot of incentive for Ingress players to review in OPR.

1830
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:51,000
And so I feel like this is just going to backlog an already backlogged system.

1831
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Can't get a bad Joe.

1832
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Niantic just needs to probably hire some people to do some of the reviews internally.

1833
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:04,000
And on top of that, I've submitted nice photos for those Pokestops and the Ingress locations.

1834
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Especially when we have old ass photos on there.

1835
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,000
And sometimes they get voted up and they're used.

1836
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:15,000
But sometimes it doesn't seem like they use the new photos to help them.

1837
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Let me get to some comments in our chat at live.vognetwork.com.

1838
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Captain Spike from the wonderful Game Buoy podcast says, Gamebuoy.org says,

1839
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I don't know though, isn't this mostly about other regions where the community is currently not being served?

1840
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:33,000
It feels like this opens the game up to communities that maybe currently aren't able to participate due to their locations.

1841
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:38,000
I realize Ingress isn't as popular. It's available in all these same areas.

1842
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:43,000
But sure, some of these rural places are probably not as well accounted for.

1843
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
But the system is this way now.

1844
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,000
But you guys don't think it's going to roll out beyond...

1845
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,000
It's going to be worldwide at some point. It really is.

1846
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:58,000
So maybe they'll geofence it so that it's really only rural places.

1847
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:03,000
I don't know, but I'm just kind of worried that it's going to get unleashed on everybody.

1848
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:07,000
What it is for now is a test, but that's kind of what it is.

1849
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:11,000
So they're only allowed to submit in those locations?

1850
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,000
They're only allowed to submit in Brazil and South Korea right now.

1851
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Limiting it to players in those locations because I can see someone, oh hey, I'm a player.

1852
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Remember how when the brand new nearby system rolled out, you only saw it in San Francisco in the beginning?

1853
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Yes.

1854
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Because it's like that. It was geofenced in that cell.

1855
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,000
The Charlie 2, which are...

1856
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
See, I'm relating it to Ingress.

1857
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:39,000
So that geofence was the exact same fence because Davis was included in some of those places.

1858
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
It was the exact same fence that makes up the Charlie 2 cell in Ingress.

1859
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,000
That was the location you could see the nearby stuff in Pokémon GO.

1860
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Anyway, cool story.

1861
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Let's see, and Bobby Blackwell says, wasn't it Russia that just got Pokémon GO released this week?

1862
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Yes, that is true. They just got Pokémon GO finally this week.

1863
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:04,000
So anyway, I'm sure not everybody's going to agree with my thoughts, but please try to consider this other game that I have invested a lot of time into.

1864
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Again, this is all I'm saying. I do not want the Pokémon GO stuff to go back into Ingress.

1865
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,000
That is it.

1866
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,000
If the Pokémon GO community wants to add every...

1867
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Every rock is a Pokéstop and everything, everywhere, every mailbox is a Pokéstop, fine.

1868
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Go for it.

1869
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
But keep it in that game.

1870
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Do not bring it to the PvP game that is Ingress.

1871
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,000
That's what I'm saying to make that very, very, very clear.

1872
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
All right.

1873
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:37,000
CaptainSpike says, gameboi.org, but I appreciate your concerns and I'm sure balance issues will arise for a time.

1874
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:44,000
But to me, this seems like growth that overall should be healthy for all of their IP based software as having more players keep them going.

1875
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:48,000
As long as the submissions are legitimate, yes.

1876
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:59,000
But let me tell you the frustration of somebody's fucking tree in their grandma's house front yard being a portal in Ingress.

1877
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Or a fake horse.

1878
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,000
It is something that holds down all of these different...

1879
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Because one team knows that's their grandma's house and that's...

1880
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:13,000
They can control that as much as they want and it fucks up the balance of the game.

1881
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Like that is a perspective that is very hard for me to explain to a Pokémon GO player.

1882
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:22,000
That is how the balance of the game can be very fucked up if anything and everything becomes a Pokéstop.

1883
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Absolutely I want more rural players to have all their Pokéstops.

1884
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,000
I really do.

1885
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
And I want rural players to have Ingress portals.

1886
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
I do.

1887
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,000
I want them to be legitimate.

1888
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Every park should be littered with this shit.

1889
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
I'm so for that.

1890
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Historical sites. Public access.

1891
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Yes, I'm all for that stuff.

1892
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Residential property. Fuck. No.

1893
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
That's my concern.

1894
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Hopefully that makes sense.

1895
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,000
I have a pretty particular looking tree, perhaps.

1896
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
All you have to do is put googly eyes on it, Loki.

1897
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
I'm going to.

1898
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:59,000
It only took us like three fucking years to get that portal removed in Ingress.

1899
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:06,000
That story, that was a true fucking story that I just explained.

1900
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Anyway, let's move on.

1901
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:15,000
I got one more story for you guys and it has to do with breaking the law, breaking the law.

1902
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
EA is breaking the law.

1903
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
No, legit, they are legit.

1904
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Yeah, I know.

1905
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
In Belgium, here's the deal.

1906
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:27,000
We know the Belgian government, because we heard about this with Overwatch, because they had to change the system and so forth.

1907
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Belgium declared loot boxes to be a form of gambling.

1908
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Well, EA has come out with FIFA 19, just came out recently and just basically said,

1909
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
we are not going to change the pack.

1910
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:43,000
EA did not modify FIFA's randomized card pack loot boxes.

1911
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:49,000
EA says that the games were developed and implemented ethically and lawfully around the world.

1912
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:52,000
They do not agree that the games are considered as any form of gambling.

1913
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Basically...

1914
01:44:53,000 --> 01:45:00,000
We're making too much fucking money from this and your little pitiful fines are going to stop us from making all of the money.

1915
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:07,000
EA is doing something that I feel, in my opinion, the president does on Twitter all the time.

1916
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,000
If I say something enough, it'll be true.

1917
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
So that's what's happening, right?

1918
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:18,000
EA is saying, it's not gambling.

1919
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,000
It's not gambling.

1920
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,000
That's their defense.

1921
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
If EA says it enough, maybe it'll be true.

1922
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Just like, it's not collusion, it's not collusion.

1923
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Right?

1924
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
It's a similar thing.

1925
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
If I say it enough, maybe it'll be true.

1926
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
I'm going to get hate mail for that one, but deal with it.

1927
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:38,000
But the reality is, at the end of the day, you are selling a product in this country,

1928
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:45,000
and if you're not following the country's rules, they're going to pursue and kick you out, basically, of being able to sell games in the country,

1929
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
possibly fine you because you've been making money off the citizens.

1930
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
I hope they fine them a lot.

1931
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Well, what's happening is that the Belgian government has launched, according to reports,

1932
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:01,000
has launched a criminal investigation into EA because they have not modified the system.

1933
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,000
This is according to the Metro publication.

1934
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
It's a publication in Belgium.

1935
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:11,000
They are being subject to a criminal investigation by the Brussels Public Prosecutor's Office.

1936
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,000
The case will go to court if they choose to prosecute.

1937
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Finland is also looking into these loot boxes as well, so more countries will hopefully jump on board.

1938
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
It's terrible.

1939
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Seriously, I don't play a lot of these sports games that these are still in because they're not taking them out of the sports games.

1940
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:34,000
They may take them out of Star Wars and out of Battlefield and stuff like that,

1941
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:41,000
but you've got to understand that this Ultimate Team shit, they're making bank off of this shit.

1942
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
They're making so much bank that they're not going to fucking compromise that.

1943
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:50,000
When my Xbox account got stolen on my Xbox 360, and it was like 10 years ago and I still haven't gotten over it,

1944
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:54,000
the thief used my card to buy a bunch of FIFA shit.

1945
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:59,000
This stuff is huge around the world, even if it's not as big in the US, so it's a little harder to picture.

1946
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:04,000
I know some people are into it, certainly here in the US, but it's not Fortnite.

1947
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:08,000
But in other countries, FIFA is the game.

1948
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:14,000
But NBA 2K19, for example, totally different company, same shit.

1949
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:20,000
The game is just so pay-to-win, even.

1950
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:27,000
You buy the collector's edition, you get 100,000 of it's even called virtual currency

1951
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:32,000
because they couldn't think of an intelligent name for it, virtual currency.

1952
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:38,000
You get 100,000 of it to help build your stats of your character in the game to be a better player.

1953
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Otherwise, you've got to grind through the game.

1954
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:45,000
And they're like, oh, it's player choice. This way, you don't have to grind as hard and stuff.

1955
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:50,000
But the problem is, you built the fucking grind into the game in the first place.

1956
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:58,000
You're not helping people, you're creating the problem and then also creating the solution for the problem that costs money.

1957
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:03,000
But people will pay it because, I don't know.

1958
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,000
It's the same reason why people will pay $1200 for a phone.

1959
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Well, you can imagine social media has lit up about this and pretty much most of what people are saying about EA.

1960
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:19,000
They're basically saying to Belgium, they're saying, yes, drag her, expose her, arrest her.

1961
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:23,000
That's basically what social media is saying to EA.

1962
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Drag them, get them.

1963
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Because I think most people have just had it with loot box shit.

1964
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:36,000
They've just had it with loot box shit and they want to see EA have to answer for it.

1965
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:41,000
If you want to make these games free to play, make FIFA a free to play game that you can just go download for free.

1966
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Hey FIFA 19, it's a free game, go download it. NBA 2K 19, it's a free game, go download it and they have loot boxes in it.

1967
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
I have no fucking problem with that.

1968
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:58,000
I'm just surprised EA had a year to think about how to make these buku bucks instead of the loot boxes and they kind of failed to do it.

1969
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:04,000
So now they're just sticking to their guns and I really think EA is going to get kicked out of Belgium for this.

1970
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
I think this is where this ends.

1971
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
EA products will be banned in Belgium.

1972
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,000
I don't think they'll fucking care because they're probably going to lose.

1973
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
It's just Belgium.

1974
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
They're going to lose less money just like whatever.

1975
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Sorry. You know what's sad? I know we have listeners in Belgium that listen to this show and I just want to say, even if EA doesn't appreciate you, I appreciate you.

1976
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Okay? And your chocolate and your waffle and all the stereotypes.

1977
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
It's a calculated risk. They understand what they're making from this.

1978
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:36,000
They don't want to give any of that up because it's tons of fucking money for doing essentially nothing.

1979
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:42,000
And that's what they're going to do. They're going to play this out because what's the worst that's going to happen?

1980
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:47,000
They're going to maybe have to pay a small fine and maybe they can't sell their game.

1981
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Oh no. The Twitter says they're going to arrest the CEO.

1982
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,000
They're not going to arrest anything.

1983
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
He's going to rot in Belgium jail.

1984
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,000
As much as I would love to see that, that's never going to happen.

1985
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Drag her. Expose her. Say it, Logie.

1986
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Drag her. Expose her.

1987
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Drag her. Expose her.

1988
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:11,000
As much as it's never going to fucking happen, we can't arrest people over here for like actual crimes and get them to the jail.

1989
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
I mean, it's never going to fucking happen.

1990
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:19,000
All right. Anyway, on that note, let's, uh, let's go.

1991
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Let's go to a time when, you know, video games were for everybody, including people in Belgium.

1992
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Let's go to the classic game of the week or acid is the classic peripheral of the month.

1993
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Uh, y'all know we use radio magic to make this happen and, uh, get dark Sakura with us here every week on the show.

1994
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:43,000
But I do want to let you know, just due to us being unexpectedly off last week, see, we had calibrated our radio magic to work last week.

1995
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:46,000
And, uh, unfortunately due to an error in the space time.

1996
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:52,000
You know what? Fuck it. The real story is we recorded it last week, so you have to hear it this week.

1997
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:56,000
So if you hear some things that are a little bit out of sync, that's why.

1998
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
That being said, radio magic.

1999
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:04,000
So let's take a trip through space and time to visit with dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

2000
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Oh, hi.

2001
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Hi. How are you?

2002
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I'm okay.

2003
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:12,000
I feel like it's been a while between, uh, our week off and, uh, you know, the, the mess up a couple of weeks ago.

2004
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
It's been a little while.

2005
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Yeah, a bit, a bit, a bit.

2006
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Uh, can you tell us quickly in 15 seconds, what have you been doing in the past three weeks?

2007
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Playing Wow.

2008
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Okay. That, that sums it up.

2009
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Going to work, being sick, playing pinball.

2010
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,000
We have a theater magic.

2011
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Oh, congrats on that.

2012
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:32,000
And it was the first time I've arranged a pinball purchase myself from ground up.

2013
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,000
She's a business woman.

2014
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Dan was very proud of me and it has nothing wrong with it.

2015
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
He's like, I don't know what to do with the machine.

2016
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,000
I don't have to work on.

2017
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:44,000
So, um, it's going to make me broke for the month.

2018
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Real quick. Cause I know it's going to come up on OLR tonight.

2019
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,000
I don't even know if you know this yet.

2020
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Did you hear about the Valley Williams license?

2021
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Uh, it was announced that the creators of Zen pinball actually have that.

2022
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:59,000
So it's going to come to pinball FX three, even though it was in the farsight studios game, the pinball arcade.

2023
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:04,000
So it was kind of, kind of surprising that I get, well, I mean it's like surprising, but not surprising.

2024
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,000
That's cool.

2025
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Yeah. So I played, they have, what's the, what's the table you can play right now?

2026
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Cause they just played earlier this week.

2027
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:14,000
The fish fishing, something real fish, real fishing, something like that.

2028
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,000
I don't know.

2029
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
I also played the getaway.

2030
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:20,000
I'm just thinking of fish tales, which was an older one.

2031
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
It was like from the nineties.

2032
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Yeah. We have the getaway.

2033
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Okay. Yeah. Oh, okay. That's a, you can play that one too. Anyway.

2034
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,000
No, I mean literally I have that machine, that table.

2035
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Yeah. I think I remember playing it at your house.

2036
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:34,000
So you have to, you have to play the pinball FX one and see how it compares.

2037
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,000
But anyway, I mean, we've been talking about all sorts of news tonight.

2038
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
We got to get into the classic game of the week.

2039
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,000
That's what you're here to do is to school us.

2040
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Not a game.

2041
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Oh, Oh, what a twist.

2042
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Oh yeah. We're a little behind.

2043
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
We got to catch up with the peripherals.

2044
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,000
We're on September now.

2045
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
We did, I did, I did, um, August.

2046
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Did we do August?

2047
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Yeah. I think August I did, um, the dance pads.

2048
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
I don't know. I think because of the work snafu,

2049
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
I think this might actually be August thing.

2050
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,000
I will look up what month we're doing and you can talk about what we're

2051
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:07,000
going to talk about. So what is the classic peripheral for the month?

2052
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,000
What it ever it is.

2053
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:15,000
The Sega 3d glasses, which I felt inspired to do wink, wink, wink, wink.

2054
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Anyway.

2055
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
It might be a suggestion because I knew I was going to talk about VR

2056
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,000
tonight. Cause I got to play Bobby's at dragon one.

2057
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:26,000
So it was a little hint. So this is 1980s, VR.

2058
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:30,000
They were also known as a Sega scope, 3d glasses. And in Brazil,

2059
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
they were called Oculus 3d Rob.

2060
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Oh, Oculus Oculus, Oculus, Oculus rift roped.

2061
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,000
And in Argentina, they were, I'm going to mispronounce this.

2062
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,000
3d.

2063
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Okay.

2064
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,000
If I remember right, if I, if I remember my Spanish from, from high school,

2065
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
I think.

2066
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Okay. Okay.

2067
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
But anyway, these were for the Sega master system and they would, uh,

2068
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,000
create an illusion of 3d graphics in some games.

2069
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:07,000
They weren't invented by the guy who did marble madness, Mark Cerny.

2070
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Um,

2071
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,000
they use a shutter system to close the left and right lenses rapidly to

2072
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
create a 3d effect.

2073
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Um,

2074
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:17,000
the master system glasses can only be used with the original Sega master

2075
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:21,000
system since it hooks up to the card port that does not exist on the master

2076
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:22,000
system too.

2077
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Um,

2078
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,000
it, uh, allows a 3d graphics in full color,

2079
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:31,000
although it halves the frame weight because of the, uh,

2080
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:34,000
the shutters and it can also produce a flicker.

2081
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:39,000
It also does not work very well with non CRT televisions.

2082
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Um,

2083
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:46,000
they came out first in the UK in October, 1987 for a 39 pound 95.

2084
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Um,

2085
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,000
North American release came out later that year.

2086
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Um,

2087
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:55,000
3d glasses were also released in Japan, November, 1987,

2088
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:00,000
and they were bundled with Zaxxon 3d and then in Brazil and South Korea in

2089
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
1989.

2090
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Now keep in mind, I guess for Brazil, you know,

2091
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,000
cause the master system is still strong in Brazil.

2092
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,000
It's a thing,

2093
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:12,000
but the games that it's compatible with is Blade Eagle,

2094
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Line of Fire for a master system, of course, Maze Hunter 3d,

2095
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Missile Defense 3d, Outrun 3d, Poseidon Wars 3d,

2096
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Space Harrier 3d and Zaxxon 3d.

2097
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Um,

2098
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
we have a pair.

2099
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000
We,

2100
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
I think we now have a TV that it,

2101
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,000
that it works with.

2102
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Um,

2103
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,000
but they're kind of like those big eighties.

2104
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,000
They look like,

2105
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:37,000
like the over glasses that you wear over like prescription glasses,

2106
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
but they're pretty cool.

2107
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Um,

2108
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
but yeah,

2109
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
that's,

2110
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,000
that's the thing.

2111
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,000
It is the,

2112
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,000
uh, the glasses.

2113
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:48,000
That's really all I can say about it cause it didn't really do for many games,

2114
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,000
but you get kind of this blinking effect on the screen cause they're gonna try

2115
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
to combine it.

2116
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
It's almost the same way.

2117
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
I think that it works on,

2118
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
um,

2119
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
the kind of the lenticular style,

2120
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,000
right?

2121
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Like,

2122
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,000
um, the 3ds does.

2123
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Yeah.

2124
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
I think that with the shutters,

2125
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
like,

2126
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,000
um,

2127
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,000
a lot of 3d TVs,

2128
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
I think kind of use that same type of stuff now because I have a TV,

2129
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
a 3d glasses that uses the shutter,

2130
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,000
but it's all,

2131
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
obviously the technology is very advanced,

2132
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
so it's kind of faster.

2133
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
You get the full frames and everything.

2134
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
When you're looking at the screen though,

2135
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,000
without the glasses.

2136
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Yeah,

2137
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,000
it's a little funny cause you have one,

2138
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,000
but actually what I was noticing,

2139
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,000
you can stare at the screen like it's one of those,

2140
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,000
um, stereo pictures.

2141
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,000
You know what I'm talking about?

2142
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Can you see the whale or whatever it was?

2143
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Sailboat.

2144
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Sailboat.

2145
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Yeah.

2146
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,000
More of a schooner.

2147
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,000
But you can,

2148
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,000
you can see it kind of hurts your eyes to do it for a while,

2149
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
but like watching you cause obviously,

2150
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Oh my gosh,

2151
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,000
y'all were using YouTube's.

2152
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Um,

2153
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,000
but watching this guy play on YouTube,

2154
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,000
like if I stare just right,

2155
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
I can see it in the 3d.

2156
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
So it's kind of,

2157
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
yeah,

2158
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
no glasses needed,

2159
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,000
but it kind of hurts my eyes.

2160
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Yeah.

2161
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,000
You don't want to like,

2162
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
you know how like they always say your face will freeze that way.

2163
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,000
I'm making that face.

2164
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
I feel like my eyes are going to freeze.

2165
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
It's like when I would save my 3d animal crossing screenshots,

2166
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
they were actually two pictures.

2167
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Yes.

2168
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,000
So it's the same effect.

2169
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
It's magic.

2170
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Yes it is.

2171
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:06,000
There it is.

2172
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000
All right.

2173
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,000
So yeah,

2174
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
there you go.

2175
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,000
There it is.

2176
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Your classic peripheral of the month for September confirmed August was the

2177
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,000
sewing machine.

2178
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Oh,

2179
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,000
that's my gosh.

2180
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Time flies.

2181
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Anyway,

2182
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,000
there it is.

2183
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,000
The classic peripheral of the month,

2184
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
the Sega scope 3d glasses.

2185
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Um,

2186
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
we have a little extra time here for the segments.

2187
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Since that didn't take you very long.

2188
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Um,

2189
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,000
what else should we talk about?

2190
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,000
How has some house?

2191
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Wow.

2192
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Been treating you if,

2193
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:31,000
if your journey,

2194
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,000
your journey back,

2195
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,000
I'm doing the Argus content.

2196
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Cause I kind of stopped playing for a little bit when that came out.

2197
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,000
So I'm really enjoying it.

2198
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Cause it's all,

2199
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,000
you know,

2200
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,000
space,

2201
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,000
self demon husband.

2202
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Um,

2203
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,000
cause I'm an Illidan fangirl.

2204
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,000
So I've really been enjoying it.

2205
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Um,

2206
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,000
I'm really enjoying the stories.

2207
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Cool single area back.

2208
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Are you playing with the game boy boys or like kind of being a loner?

2209
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
The only person who I've seen on was spike.

2210
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Okay.

2211
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,000
So,

2212
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,000
so,

2213
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,000
um,

2214
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:58,000
that spike gets around cause I saw him in overwatch the other day too.

2215
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:03,000
So I got a cappuccino today that they put an overwatch symbol on and cocoa.

2216
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,000
What?

2217
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,000
It was at this,

2218
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,000
um,

2219
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,000
comic book store.

2220
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Oh,

2221
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Oh yeah.

2222
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,000
I know that place.

2223
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,000
The,

2224
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
yes.

2225
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,000
I think it's overwatch.

2226
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,000
No,

2227
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:17,000
the number one gaming podcast in town does stuff with that place.

2228
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,000
So I'm not surprised at all.

2229
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Cause I know they're big overwatch fans over there.

2230
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,000
So what?

2231
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Number one,

2232
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,000
like P

2233
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,000
no,

2234
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,000
we're fans of everybody.

2235
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,000
We just have to be a little,

2236
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,000
you know,

2237
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,000
I'm a shady fan.

2238
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Yeah.

2239
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,000
But anyway,

2240
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,000
in all seriousness,

2241
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,000
I know what place you're talking about.

2242
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Yeah.

2243
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Yeah.

2244
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,000
So that's really cute.

2245
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,000
I like that.

2246
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,000
So,

2247
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:38,000
um,

2248
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:39,000
I have,

2249
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,000
I had an overwatch cappuccino and then,

2250
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,000
um,

2251
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:44,000
I saw the little mermaid at the crust theater and it was fun.

2252
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,000
That's fun.

2253
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Um,

2254
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,000
you know what you didn't see?

2255
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:48,000
That makes me sad.

2256
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,200
You did not see the mass effect voice actors panel that I did a dragon con and you need

2257
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:52,200
to,

2258
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:53,200
you need to,

2259
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:54,200
uh,

2260
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:55,200
I really,

2261
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:56,200
really,

2262
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:57,200
really bitter,

2263
01:58:57,200 --> 01:58:58,200
like bad coffee,

2264
01:58:58,200 --> 01:58:59,200
Rob.

2265
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:00,200
I really,

2266
01:59:00,200 --> 01:59:01,200
really,

2267
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:02,200
really want to get Courtney Taylor on the show.

2268
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:03,200
She did the voice of Jack.

2269
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:04,200
Um,

2270
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:05,200
she's got this great chair.

2271
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:06,200
I'll give it a shot.

2272
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:07,200
I'm going to give this a shout out for free cause I love what she's doing.

2273
01:59:07,200 --> 01:59:08,200
Um,

2274
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:09,200
I know her and I think it's Mary Elizabeth McGlynn,

2275
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:10,200
uh,

2276
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:11,200
put on this nerds vote.

2277
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:12,200
Uh,

2278
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:13,200
so they're trying to,

2279
01:59:13,200 --> 01:59:14,200
they go to conventions and they register nerds to vote.

2280
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:15,200
Um,

2281
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:16,200
you know,

2282
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:17,200
cause it's all about getting people where they're,

2283
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:18,200
they're not partisan.

2284
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:19,200
They're not going to tell you to register one way or the other.

2285
01:59:19,200 --> 01:59:21,200
Make sure you get registered because,

2286
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:22,200
um,

2287
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:23,200
voting is like really important.

2288
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:25,200
I'll tell you who to vote for.

2289
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:26,200
Not right now though.

2290
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:27,200
I know you will.

2291
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:29,200
You reach out on Twitter and you'll happily say,

2292
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:30,200
but I'm,

2293
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:32,200
I'm pretty sure if you did reach out to these people,

2294
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:33,200
they would have their own opinions too.

2295
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:34,200
However,

2296
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:38,200
we put all that aside to just get people registered so that their voices can be

2297
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:39,200
heard.

2298
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:40,200
Just like Mr.

2299
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:41,200
voice is so loud right now.

2300
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:42,200
He's probably picking up on the,

2301
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:43,200
um,

2302
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:44,200
microphone.

2303
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:45,200
He's very upset about something.

2304
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:46,200
All right.

2305
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:47,200
Anyway,

2306
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:48,200
he got boob perching time,

2307
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:50,200
which by the way,

2308
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:51,200
if you guys don't know,

2309
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:52,200
Mr.

2310
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:53,200
Smoosh will hang out like Mr.

2311
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:54,200
Smoosh,

2312
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:55,200
you know,

2313
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:56,200
is usually not the pickup type of cat.

2314
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:57,200
I can't pick them up.

2315
01:59:57,200 --> 01:59:58,200
Alan can't pick them up,

2316
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:00,200
but Jamie can pick up Mr.

2317
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:03,200
Smoosh because Jamie has a certain pair of boobs.

2318
02:00:03,200 --> 02:00:04,200
Yes,

2319
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:05,200
she has boobs and triple D's.

2320
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:07,200
Apparently you can stand on them.

2321
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:08,200
Mr.

2322
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:11,200
Smoosh is very clearly a straight cat because he loves the boobs.

2323
02:00:11,200 --> 02:00:12,200
I mean,

2324
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:13,200
even gay men like,

2325
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:14,200
I know I was gonna say,

2326
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:15,200
actually I know a lot of gay men that loves boobs,

2327
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:16,200
but he's,

2328
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:17,200
you know,

2329
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:19,200
he's very attached to your,

2330
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:20,200
your breath.

2331
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:22,200
I'm a little though angry with myself.

2332
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:23,200
Speaking of gay things.

2333
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:24,200
Okay.

2334
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:26,200
Cause I have something for you at my house.

2335
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:27,200
Have you,

2336
02:00:27,200 --> 02:00:28,200
I got unicorn cereal.

2337
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:30,200
I think Kellogg's unicorn cereal.

2338
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:31,200
You sent me the text yesterday.

2339
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:32,200
It looks hilarious.

2340
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:33,200
Yes.

2341
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:34,200
It's on,

2342
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:35,200
it's on my table.

2343
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:36,200
I didn't go back home or I would have brought it.

2344
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:37,200
What do unicorns taste like?

2345
02:00:37,200 --> 02:00:38,200
Rainbows and sheet cakes.

2346
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:40,200
I played a unicorn card game today.

2347
02:00:40,200 --> 02:00:41,200
And I already forgot the name of it.

2348
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:42,200
Is it exploding?

2349
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:43,200
It's the,

2350
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:44,200
it's the exploding kittens,

2351
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:45,200
but the unicorn game.

2352
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:46,200
Like farting unicorns or something?

2353
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:47,200
No,

2354
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:48,200
it's a magical unicorns or something.

2355
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:49,200
I don't remember,

2356
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:50,200
but I won.

2357
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:51,200
It was fun.

2358
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:52,200
Well,

2359
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:53,200
I want to do a giveaway on the show.

2360
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:54,200
I haven't decided what,

2361
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:55,200
but I mean how,

2362
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:56,200
how to do it,

2363
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:57,200
but I know what I'm going to give.

2364
02:00:57,200 --> 02:00:58,200
There's,

2365
02:00:58,200 --> 02:00:59,200
there's always that point system on VOG for checking in and we haven't done the

2366
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:00,200
giveaway on there forever.

2367
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:02,200
I'm going to do a glitter pack from,

2368
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:03,200
uh,

2369
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:04,200
uh,

2370
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:05,200
cards against humanity.

2371
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:06,200
Oh,

2372
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:07,200
you're going to actually send.

2373
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:08,200
I have five of them and I'll give,

2374
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:10,200
I'll give one to a listener if they don't suck.

2375
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:11,200
Okay.

2376
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:12,200
Well,

2377
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:13,200
I do.

2378
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:14,200
Do you want them to tweet you or how do you want to do that?

2379
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:15,200
I'll figure it out.

2380
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:16,200
Just know that it's coming.

2381
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:19,200
Stay tuned for next week when Jamie like figures it out.

2382
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:20,200
All right.

2383
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:21,200
Anyway.

2384
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:22,200
Mail the mailbox and make Rob check it.

2385
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:23,200
He'll tell me.

2386
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,200
Participate at orangeonsharing.com.

2387
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:25,200
Okay.

2388
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:26,200
We're also brought Rob candy.

2389
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:28,200
We're here to wrap up the classic game of the week.

2390
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:29,200
So the Sega 3d glasses.

2391
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:30,200
Yes.

2392
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:31,200
Yes.

2393
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:32,200
All right.

2394
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:33,200
Uh,

2395
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:34,200
any last thoughts before we get back to the main show?

2396
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:35,200
I want Chinese food.

2397
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:36,200
That's it.

2398
02:01:43,200 --> 02:01:44,200
Thank you,

2399
02:01:44,200 --> 02:01:45,200
Jamie for the segment.

2400
02:01:45,200 --> 02:01:47,200
We miss having her here live in studio,

2401
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:49,200
but I think she's going to be here at the end of the month.

2402
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:50,200
Uh,

2403
02:01:50,200 --> 02:01:51,200
while she's still,

2404
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:52,200
you know,

2405
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:53,200
again,

2406
02:01:53,200 --> 02:01:54,200
if you are not already aware,

2407
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:55,200
even though he said this on a show a million times,

2408
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:56,200
she has a conflict with her,

2409
02:01:56,200 --> 02:01:57,200
you know,

2410
02:01:57,200 --> 02:01:58,200
paying day job schedule.

2411
02:01:58,200 --> 02:01:59,200
Unfortunately,

2412
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:00,200
she has to work Sundays right now,

2413
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:01,200
so she can't be with us during the live shows.

2414
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:02,200
So we're trying to at least still include her,

2415
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:03,200
uh,

2416
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:04,200
through,

2417
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:05,200
through the magic of radio,

2418
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:06,200
uh,

2419
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:07,200
with her classic game of the week segment.

2420
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:08,200
And then,

2421
02:02:08,200 --> 02:02:09,200
um,

2422
02:02:09,200 --> 02:02:10,200
hopefully we'll,

2423
02:02:10,200 --> 02:02:11,200
you know,

2424
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:12,200
be able to have her here at least once a month.

2425
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:13,200
I know that's her plan.

2426
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:14,200
Um,

2427
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:16,200
we're going to get back into the show and we've still got a lot of news to

2428
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:17,200
come.

2429
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:18,200
We're running pretty long tonight,

2430
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:21,200
so we're going to try to try to catch up here a little bit,

2431
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:23,200
but we do still want to have plenty of time to take your calls.

2432
02:02:23,200 --> 02:02:25,200
Orange lounge radio on Skype,

2433
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:26,200
uh,

2434
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:27,200
a little later in the show.

2435
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:28,200
Uh,

2436
02:02:28,200 --> 02:02:29,200
also just a couple of quick things cause it was asked about,

2437
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:30,200
you know,

2438
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:33,200
cause obviously this whole announcement about the Twitch move eventually,

2439
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:34,200
um,

2440
02:02:34,200 --> 02:02:35,200
is,

2441
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:36,200
you know,

2442
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:37,200
caused a lot of chat,

2443
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:38,200
which by the way,

2444
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:39,200
one way I also kind of explained this to somebody that I think may help you

2445
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:41,200
kind of understand where this is coming from,

2446
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:42,200
you know,

2447
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:43,200
why we're making a move like this.

2448
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:44,200
Just think about this.

2449
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:49,200
How many shout cast streams have you searched for to listen to in the past

2450
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:52,200
month versus how many Twitch streams have you looked for?

2451
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:56,200
And maybe the answer for you in particular is zero,

2452
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:59,200
but ask about 10 or 20 of your nerd friends,

2453
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:00,200
that same question.

2454
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:02,200
And I think you'll completely like,

2455
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:03,200
I think what's that?

2456
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:04,200
Which show cast?

2457
02:03:04,200 --> 02:03:05,200
I know,

2458
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:06,200
right?

2459
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:07,200
Or are we talking about shot?

2460
02:03:07,200 --> 02:03:09,200
Are we talking about a commentating over video games?

2461
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:10,200
Cause that's what they call that now.

2462
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:11,200
You know,

2463
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:12,200
one of Bobby's panels was about shout casting,

2464
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:13,200
but it was not,

2465
02:03:13,200 --> 02:03:15,200
it was not the software.

2466
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:16,200
It was that's comp.

2467
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:18,200
That's what they call commentating over video games.

2468
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:20,200
So that was actually a really fascinating panel,

2469
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:21,200
by the way,

2470
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:22,200
I wish,

2471
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:24,200
I wish some of those would be online for you to listen to later,

2472
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:25,200
but I guess this is part of the reason you have to be there.

2473
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:26,200
Uh,

2474
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:27,200
anyhow,

2475
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:28,200
uh,

2476
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:29,200
fifth dream says,

2477
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:30,200
I forgot,

2478
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:31,200
we'll vog still be on tune in.

2479
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:32,200
Um,

2480
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:33,200
no,

2481
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:34,200
uh,

2482
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:35,200
when this goes into effect,

2483
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:36,200
uh,

2484
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:38,200
the goal is that that will be sunset it actually that because tune in is

2485
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:39,200
simply a shout cast directory,

2486
02:03:39,200 --> 02:03:40,200
basically for that.

2487
02:03:40,200 --> 02:03:41,200
Um,

2488
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:42,200
and that will be sunsetted.

2489
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:43,200
Um,

2490
02:03:43,200 --> 02:03:44,200
so that is part of the change,

2491
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:45,200
uh,

2492
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:46,200
that's going to,

2493
02:03:46,200 --> 02:03:47,200
uh,

2494
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:48,200
be,

2495
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:49,200
uh,

2496
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:50,200
coming into play here.

2497
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:51,200
Um,

2498
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:52,200
but then,

2499
02:03:52,200 --> 02:03:53,200
uh,

2500
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:54,200
what else did I want to say there with,

2501
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:55,200
um,

2502
02:03:55,200 --> 02:03:56,200
the questions and so forth that we were getting,

2503
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:57,200
um,

2504
02:03:57,200 --> 02:03:58,200
uh,

2505
02:03:58,200 --> 02:03:59,200
there was something else,

2506
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:00,200
so I guess I'll think of it later.

2507
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:01,200
Uh,

2508
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:02,200
in the meantime,

2509
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:03,200
let's get into some rapid fire news.

2510
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:04,200
Uh,

2511
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:05,200
Oh,

2512
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:06,200
it was the Skype real quick.

2513
02:04:06,200 --> 02:04:07,200
Uh,

2514
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:10,200
will we be able to show your video out on the video?

2515
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:11,200
Um,

2516
02:04:11,200 --> 02:04:12,200
hypothetically,

2517
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:13,200
yes,

2518
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:15,200
I can't guarantee that's going to be in place day one,

2519
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:16,200
but that is,

2520
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:19,200
let me say the goal is to continue to take calls on Skype just as we always

2521
02:04:19,200 --> 02:04:21,200
have been at least for now.

2522
02:04:21,200 --> 02:04:22,200
Um,

2523
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:23,200
in all honesty,

2524
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:25,200
I'm aware a lot of Twitch people use discord to take their calls.

2525
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:26,200
Uh,

2526
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:28,200
it's something in the back of my mind,

2527
02:04:28,200 --> 02:04:29,200
but one,

2528
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:32,200
one big change at a time is enough.

2529
02:04:32,200 --> 02:04:35,200
Let's try to keep everything else normal for now.

2530
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,200
All right,

2531
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:37,200
let's move on.

2532
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:38,200
Uh,

2533
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:39,200
some rapid fire news.

2534
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:40,200
Loki.

2535
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:41,200
Uh,

2536
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:42,200
so,

2537
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:43,200
uh,

2538
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:45,200
Metro Metro Exodus has been delayed to 2019,

2539
02:04:45,200 --> 02:04:47,200
which is kind of weird cause I thought it was coming out in 2019.

2540
02:04:47,200 --> 02:04:49,200
I was unaware that it was actually scheduled for this year,

2541
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:53,200
but apparently it is going to be delayed.

2542
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:56,200
The development of Metro Exodus is progressing well.

2543
02:04:56,200 --> 02:04:59,200
We are really excited by what we're seeing.

2544
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:00,200
We have constantly,

2545
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:01,200
um,

2546
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:05,200
we're constantly reviewing the games progress to ensure that we deliver a

2547
02:05:05,200 --> 02:05:09,200
product that gamers and fans of the Metro series want and deserve.

2548
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:13,200
And as well as keeping an eye on announcements from our competitor,

2549
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:14,200
it ain't finished.

2550
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:16,200
Just put out a three WordPress release.

2551
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:17,200
It ain't finished.

2552
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:18,200
It's ambitious.

2553
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:19,200
We need more time.

2554
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:21,200
So Q1 2019,

2555
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:22,200
we,

2556
02:05:22,200 --> 02:05:26,200
we don't want this game to turn out like mass effect Andromeda.

2557
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:27,200
So,

2558
02:05:27,200 --> 02:05:29,200
which had already been delayed several times.

2559
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:32,200
We will just have to wait a little longer.

2560
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:33,200
All right.

2561
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:34,200
Um,

2562
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:39,200
and then something else that's going to be coming out on PlayStation VR is

2563
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:41,200
space shell five there.

2564
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:45,200
They have a version that's going to be coming out on PlayStation VR as well as

2565
02:05:45,200 --> 02:05:46,200
the HTC Vive.

2566
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:47,200
Uh,

2567
02:05:47,200 --> 02:05:50,200
no details yet on when we can expect that,

2568
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:55,200
but apparently they've had a VR version in the arcades in Japan for a while

2569
02:05:55,200 --> 02:05:56,200
now.

2570
02:05:56,200 --> 02:05:57,200
Um,

2571
02:05:57,200 --> 02:05:59,200
and I think that the game is supposed to be,

2572
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:02,200
I don't know if it follows the exact,

2573
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:03,200
you know,

2574
02:06:03,200 --> 02:06:05,200
format as the first game,

2575
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:06,200
but basically,

2576
02:06:06,200 --> 02:06:07,200
you know,

2577
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:10,200
same premise and everything fighting the aliens and stuff like that rhythm

2578
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:11,200
game.

2579
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:12,200
Um,

2580
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:14,200
I'll definitely check it out when it comes out over here,

2581
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:16,200
whenever that is,

2582
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:19,200
I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

2583
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:20,200
All right.

2584
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:21,200
Well,

2585
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:22,200
let's move on.

2586
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:23,200
So you remember,

2587
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:24,200
um,

2588
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:25,200
it was on the last episode of OLR before we took a,

2589
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:26,200
the break here,

2590
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:28,200
but we talked about how the last remnant was going to be delisted from the

2591
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:29,200
Xbox.

2592
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:30,200
Yes.

2593
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:31,200
Or as you know,

2594
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:32,200
it was delisted from steam.

2595
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:33,200
It was delisted from the Xbox.

2596
02:06:33,200 --> 02:06:34,200
We never really got an answer on that,

2597
02:06:34,200 --> 02:06:35,200
but,

2598
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:36,200
uh,

2599
02:06:36,200 --> 02:06:37,200
we know the physical edition is available.

2600
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:38,200
Well,

2601
02:06:38,200 --> 02:06:39,200
I think we figured out why,

2602
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:42,200
because the last remnant remastered is on its way for the PlayStation four.

2603
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:43,200
That is something that,

2604
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:44,200
uh,

2605
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:45,200
they announced this week.

2606
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:46,200
Uh,

2607
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:47,200
I don't know though.

2608
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:49,200
Is this something that like we need Loki?

2609
02:06:49,200 --> 02:06:51,200
Is this a game that needs to be remastered?

2610
02:06:51,200 --> 02:06:52,200
I don't know.

2611
02:06:52,200 --> 02:06:53,200
No,

2612
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:54,200
not really,

2613
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:55,200
but hell they're remastered all the other games.

2614
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:56,200
So why not?

2615
02:06:56,200 --> 02:06:57,200
Yeah.

2616
02:06:57,200 --> 02:06:58,200
Why not?

2617
02:06:58,200 --> 02:06:59,200
Right.

2618
02:06:59,200 --> 02:07:00,200
So anyway,

2619
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:01,200
I can't think of anything to make.

2620
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:03,200
This will be a PlayStation four exclusive,

2621
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:04,200
uh,

2622
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:05,200
and it's going to be out worldwide on December 6th.

2623
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:07,200
And I believe it is only something you can download.

2624
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:08,200
It's not going to be something you can,

2625
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:09,200
uh,

2626
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:10,200
go buy in a store.

2627
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:11,200
So,

2628
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:12,200
uh,

2629
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:13,200
check that out.

2630
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:14,200
I suppose if that's something that you're into.

2631
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:17,200
Also a follow up on a game we talked about a long time ago on this show,

2632
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:21,200
you'd have to go all the way back to episode 571.

2633
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:25,200
When we had the developer of time spinner on this game on the show,

2634
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:26,200
you remember time spinner,

2635
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:27,200
uh,

2636
02:07:27,200 --> 02:07:28,200
time spinner,

2637
02:07:28,200 --> 02:07:29,200
uh,

2638
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:31,200
the date for a PlayStation four Vita and PC.

2639
02:07:31,200 --> 02:07:33,200
It is finally coming out,

2640
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:34,200
which is a great news.

2641
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:35,200
They are,

2642
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:36,200
were announced for,

2643
02:07:36,200 --> 02:07:37,200
I think,

2644
02:07:37,200 --> 02:07:38,200
um,

2645
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:39,200
let's see,

2646
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:40,200
what is the big,

2647
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:41,200
I'm trying to find the date that was actually announced here.

2648
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:42,200
Uh,

2649
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:44,200
because we started seeing some of the trailers and stuff.

2650
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:45,200
There it is.

2651
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:46,200
Thank you.

2652
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:47,200
September 25th,

2653
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:48,200
uh,

2654
02:07:48,200 --> 02:07:49,200
is the day that this will be out.

2655
02:07:49,200 --> 02:07:50,200
Uh,

2656
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:51,200
obviously that was,

2657
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:52,200
that was a while ago that we did in this interview.

2658
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:53,200
So I know this game has been in development for a while,

2659
02:07:53,200 --> 02:07:54,200
but,

2660
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:55,200
uh,

2661
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:56,200
it's,

2662
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:57,200
I,

2663
02:07:57,200 --> 02:07:58,200
I think,

2664
02:07:58,200 --> 02:07:59,200
uh,

2665
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:00,200
it's,

2666
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:01,200
it's,

2667
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:02,200
uh,

2668
02:08:02,200 --> 02:08:03,200
it's been on the show and it's like,

2669
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:04,200
it's him.

2670
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:05,200
And he's contracted a few of the things out,

2671
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:06,200
I think,

2672
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:07,200
but for the most part,

2673
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:08,200
it's him developing the game.

2674
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:09,200
So,

2675
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:10,200
um,

2676
02:08:10,200 --> 02:08:11,200
you know,

2677
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:12,200
it's been taken time because it's a lot of work for one person.

2678
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:13,200
So it's great to see that it's,

2679
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:14,200
uh,

2680
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:15,200
finally,

2681
02:08:15,200 --> 02:08:16,200
uh,

2682
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:17,200
on its way to be done and he'll get to see everybody,

2683
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:18,200
hopefully,

2684
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:19,200
uh,

2685
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:20,200
really enjoy this game.

2686
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:21,200
It looks great.

2687
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:22,200
Like as far as like the pixel art and everything,

2688
02:08:22,200 --> 02:08:23,200
it really looks gorgeous.

2689
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:24,200
So,

2690
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:25,200
uh,

2691
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:26,200
really happy for Bodie.

2692
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:27,200
Can't wait to play it myself.

2693
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:28,200
I was up in Seattle once.

2694
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:29,200
It's great.

2695
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:30,200
Really nice guy.

2696
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:31,200
So very happy for his,

2697
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:32,200
um,

2698
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:33,200
success.

2699
02:08:33,200 --> 02:08:34,200
Hope he,

2700
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:35,200
hope he does very well with time spinner.

2701
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:36,200
I'll have to see if you come back on the show.

2702
02:08:36,200 --> 02:08:37,200
Once the game is released,

2703
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:38,200
I think that would be a lot of fun.

2704
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:39,200
All right.

2705
02:08:39,200 --> 02:08:40,200
Let's see what's going to be out a little sooner though.

2706
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:41,200
In the September 25th,

2707
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:42,200
as in next week,

2708
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:44,200
as we travel around the world and check out what's coming out in stores.

2709
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:45,200
Yes.

2710
02:08:45,200 --> 02:08:50,200
We've got the Bard's Tale for Barrows Deep coming out on PC,

2711
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:51,200

2712

not balls deep,

2713
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:53,200
but Barrows Deep,

2714
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:54,200

Hmm.

I have to check that out.

2736
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:30,200
I haven't played a star control game in a while.

2737
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:31,200
That's on PC,

2738

Let's travel over to Japan and look at the releases there.

2756
02:10:11,200 --> 02:10:12,200
Uh,

2757
02:10:12,200 --> 02:10:16,200

02:10:22,200 --> 02:10:23,200

02:10:23,200 --> 02:10:25,200
And then there's an atlier trilogy that is making its way out,

this week on the PlayStation four.

2769
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:34,200
And if the individual releases are not good enough for you,

2770
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:36,200
then pick up the premium box that has all of them.

2771
02:10:36,200 --> 02:10:37,200

2772
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:38,200

2774
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:42,200
Quickly looking at other consoles such as the switch that Stein's gate is

2775
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:44,200
also released in Japan this week.

2776
02:10:44,200 --> 02:10:45,200
Um,

2777
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:48,200
as well as the game called nil add me or Ari no 10 bin,

2778
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:49,200
uh,

2779
02:10:49,200 --> 02:10:53,200
Niro Dori and Nadi Shiko comes out this week from idea factory.

2780
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:57,200
And that same atlier trilogy is also on the Nintendo switch,

2781
02:10:57,200 --> 02:10:58,200
uh,

2782
02:10:58,200 --> 02:10:59,200
the same way with the box set.

2783
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:01,200
If you want one more game on the switch this week,

2784
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:05,200
Dyson Ryaku perfect 4.0 is out this week.

2785
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:06,200
So that is a,

2786
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:07,200
uh,

2787
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:08,200
that's another one of those,

2788
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:09,200
uh,

2789
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:10,200
strategy games with tanks and planes.

2790
02:11:10,200 --> 02:11:11,200
And,

2791
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:12,200
you know,

2792
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:14,200
we love those war SIM strategy games.

2793
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:17,200
So there's tanks and planes who doesn't love tanks and planes and blown them

2794
02:11:17,200 --> 02:11:18,200
up.

2795
02:11:18,200 --> 02:11:19,200
So you can do that on the switch this week.

2796
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:20,200
Uh,

2797
02:11:20,200 --> 02:11:21,200
Loki,

2798
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:22,200
how about the UK with a dark soccer being out?

2799
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:23,200
Uh,

2800
02:11:23,200 --> 02:11:24,200
we've got Tom Clancy's ghost recam,

2801
02:11:24,200 --> 02:11:25,200
wild lands,

2802
02:11:25,200 --> 02:11:27,200
year two gold edition.

2803
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:28,200
Come on.

2804
02:11:28,200 --> 02:11:29,200
You're too gold edition.

2805
02:11:29,200 --> 02:11:31,200
You can't fucking do that shit.

2806
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:32,200
That,

2807
02:11:32,200 --> 02:11:33,200
that.

2808
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:35,200
So now this game of the year and game of the next year.

2809
02:11:35,200 --> 02:11:36,200
Hey,

2810
02:11:36,200 --> 02:11:37,200
we're,

2811
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:38,200
we're gaming the year twice in a row.

2812
02:11:38,200 --> 02:11:40,200
You can't fucking whatever.

2813
02:11:40,200 --> 02:11:41,200
I guess they make their own rules up.

2814
02:11:41,200 --> 02:11:46,200
That's coming out on PlayStation four and Xbox one fishing SIM world on a

2815
02:11:47,200 --> 02:11:49,200
PlayStation four and Xbox one candle,

2816
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:54,200
the power of the flame that's on PlayStation four and the switch little

2817
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:59,200
dragons cafe on the PlayStation four and the switch broken sword five,

2818
02:11:59,200 --> 02:12:00,200
the servant's curse.

2819
02:12:00,200 --> 02:12:01,200
Also on the switch,

2820
02:12:01,200 --> 02:12:05,200
the banner saga trilogy on the switch,

2821
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:07,200
uh,

2822
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:12,200
four 28 Shibuya scramble on PlayStation four and that's it.

2823
02:12:13,200 --> 02:12:14,200
Okay,

2824
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:16,200
let's get to the emails.

2825
02:12:23,200 --> 02:12:25,200
Every week you guys email us,

2826
02:12:25,200 --> 02:12:26,200
participate at orange laundry,

2827
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:29,200
do.com and we read some of our favorites here on the show.

2828
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:30,200
And as you can,

2829
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:31,200
Ooh,

2830
02:12:31,200 --> 02:12:32,200
excuse me,

2831
02:12:32,200 --> 02:12:33,200
hiccups.

2832
02:12:33,200 --> 02:12:34,200
As you can imagine,

2833
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:36,200
we have a little bit of a backlog cause we haven't been here for a bit.

2834
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:37,200
So I've got some old emails.

2835
02:12:37,200 --> 02:12:40,200
I got some dusty ass emails to read for you tonight,

2836
02:12:40,200 --> 02:12:42,200
but they're all good and they deserve their attention.

2837
02:12:42,200 --> 02:12:45,200
So if you want to email us something new and modern and sleek,

2838
02:12:45,200 --> 02:12:48,200
you can participate at orange lounge radio.com.

2839
02:12:48,200 --> 02:12:50,200
So this email is from September 5th.

2840
02:12:50,200 --> 02:12:52,200
I'm going to tell you what day they're from because some of the news and

2841
02:12:52,200 --> 02:12:53,200
things may have changed.

2842
02:12:53,200 --> 02:12:55,200
These emails are getting old at this point.

2843
02:12:55,200 --> 02:12:56,200
So,

2844
02:12:56,200 --> 02:12:57,200
but you know,

2845
02:12:57,200 --> 02:12:58,200
nobody knew that we wouldn't have a show last week.

2846
02:12:58,200 --> 02:12:59,200
So anyway,

2847
02:12:59,200 --> 02:13:00,200
uh,

2848
02:13:00,200 --> 02:13:03,200
this email from September 5th is from Frodo swagons who says Frodo swagons

2849
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:04,200
here.

2850
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:05,200
I'll keep it short and sweet.

2851
02:13:05,200 --> 02:13:06,200
Damn it sucks.

2852
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:07,200
There was no show over labor day weekend.

2853
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:10,200
I could have finally been in the live chat room because I had time off work

2854
02:13:10,200 --> 02:13:11,200
frowny face,

2855
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:12,200
but that's okay.

2856
02:13:12,200 --> 02:13:14,200
Dragon con must've been a blast.

2857
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:15,200
Spoiler alert.

2858
02:13:15,200 --> 02:13:18,200
It was a hope you and Bobby had a good old time.

2859
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:19,200
Spoiler alert.

2860
02:13:19,200 --> 02:13:20,200
We did.

2861
02:13:20,200 --> 02:13:21,200
Uh,

2862
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:25,200
finally you should totally get that Julian kid back on the show.

2863
02:13:25,200 --> 02:13:26,200
I think that was his name.

2864
02:13:26,200 --> 02:13:27,200
That was quite entertaining.

2865
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:28,200
Yes,

2866
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:29,200
that was,

2867
02:13:29,200 --> 02:13:30,200
um,

2868
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:31,200
Jamie's BFF Becky.

2869
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:32,200
That is her kid Julian.

2870
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:33,200
And it's been about a year,

2871
02:13:33,200 --> 02:13:34,200
right?

2872
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:35,200
So we,

2873
02:13:35,200 --> 02:13:37,200
we might stand to have a check in with Julian at some point,

2874
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:38,200
see what he's playing now.

2875
02:13:38,200 --> 02:13:39,200
Anyway,

2876
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:40,200
uh,

2877
02:13:40,200 --> 02:13:42,200
no inter- taining a fucking fish rod controller.

2878
02:13:42,200 --> 02:13:43,200
That was,

2879
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:44,200
um,

2880
02:13:44,200 --> 02:13:45,200
something that he had exclaimed on that.

2881
02:13:45,200 --> 02:13:46,200
That I believe,

2882
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:47,200
uh,

2883
02:13:47,200 --> 02:13:47,700
Rob,

2884
02:13:47,700 --> 02:13:50,200
wear a diaper next time he comes on because you were losing your shit.

2885
02:13:50,200 --> 02:13:51,200
Well,

2886
02:13:51,200 --> 02:13:52,200
that kids are funny,

2887
02:13:52,200 --> 02:13:53,200
uh,

2888
02:13:53,200 --> 02:13:54,200
which made me lose my shit because your laugh is contagious.

2889
02:13:54,200 --> 02:13:55,200
Thank you.

2890
02:13:55,200 --> 02:13:56,200
Anyway,

2891
02:13:56,200 --> 02:13:57,200
Miss you.

2892
02:13:57,200 --> 02:13:58,200
Jamie Summers,

2893
02:13:58,200 --> 02:13:59,200
uh,

2894
02:13:59,200 --> 02:14:00,200
Loki.

2895
02:14:00,200 --> 02:14:01,200
Keep up the Nintendo rants.

2896
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:02,200
I hope you're satisfied tonight.

2897
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:03,200
Uh,

2898
02:14:03,200 --> 02:14:04,200
and Rob,

2899
02:14:04,200 --> 02:14:05,200
you should totally stream more fist bump.

2900
02:14:05,200 --> 02:14:06,200
I'm trying buddy.

2901
02:14:06,200 --> 02:14:07,200
I'm trying.

2902
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:08,200
Um,

2903
02:14:08,200 --> 02:14:09,200
if all my issues are not miraculously,

2904
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:13,640
miraculously cured when Comcast comes out for the second time on Tuesday, you

2905
02:14:13,640 --> 02:14:17,240
can expect I'll probably do some more video-on-demand stuff. So, I mean, I did

2906
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:20,560
one video pre-recorded today, so you can check that out on my channel over at

2907
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:24,520
Rob Roberts. So if you want to see me lamenting about internet issues while I

2908
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:27,760
play World of Warcraft, you can see that. And I might do more of that if I have to.

2909
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:32,320
Let's get to an email from Robert M. on Friday, August 31st. So this would have

2910
02:14:32,320 --> 02:14:36,280
been while I was away at DragonCon. So Robert M. says, it's only tangentially

2911
02:14:36,280 --> 02:14:39,040
related to gaming, which I assume his voice in the soon-to-be-available

2912
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:45,800
Spider-Man game, spoiler alert, it's out. That game was released, and apparently

2913
02:14:45,800 --> 02:14:49,640
it's really good. It is, and I've been on the fence of buying it, because I buy a

2914
02:14:49,640 --> 02:14:52,920
lot of games and I don't end up playing them, and they're, like, I buy good games

2915
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:57,480
and don't end up playing them. Like, that's why I didn't buy God of War, and that's why I

2916
02:14:57,480 --> 02:15:00,320
haven't bought Spider-Man yet, although I am on the fence on it. It looks pretty good.

2917
02:15:00,320 --> 02:15:04,200
The only thing for me is that I don't get as into the comic book stuff as

2918
02:15:04,200 --> 02:15:07,280
other people do. I'm not a hater, I just don't, like, I don't have that. I don't

2919
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:10,600
think you necessarily need to be a fan of that. Yeah, I'm hearing it's basically

2920
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:17,160
Arkham Asylum and those games, but Spider-Man. And I love those Batman games. There's a lot of, like, the costumes you can unlock and stuff through the

2921
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:20,720
game. You can unlock a bunch of stuff in the comics, but I don't think you

2922
02:15:20,720 --> 02:15:26,120
necessarily need to be, like, a super fan of Spider-Man to be able to enjoy it. Yeah, no, you really don't. So, I mean,

2923
02:15:26,120 --> 02:15:30,380
here, honestly, this is what did it. It came out the same day as Dragon Quest 11,

2924
02:15:30,380 --> 02:15:34,660
and I'm looking at him going, I already am terrible about finishing games, and

2925
02:15:34,660 --> 02:15:38,140
Dragon Quest 11 is going to be a 100 hour game. That's what, that's what I

2926
02:15:38,140 --> 02:15:42,500
believe it's quoted as. So, the main quest is somewhere around, like, 100 hours. So,

2927
02:15:42,500 --> 02:15:46,300
you know, that, that kind of made my decision for me. But with as much love

2928
02:15:46,300 --> 02:15:48,700
as Spider-Man's getting and everything that's being shared out there and all

2929
02:15:48,700 --> 02:15:56,500
the people streaming it and stuff, I'm tempted. I'm tempted. Anyway, let's see. The

2930
02:15:56,500 --> 02:15:59,900
soon-to-be-available Spider-Man game. Ah, yes. But I have been wondering for a while, who

2931
02:15:59,940 --> 02:16:04,380
is the Stan Lee of Detective Comics? I'm not trying to overlook Jack Kirby's

2932
02:16:04,380 --> 02:16:07,720
importance to Marvel, of course, and one could very well say Stan Lee is

2933
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:10,740
literally the Stan Lee of Detective Comics, since he has apparently worked

2934
02:16:10,740 --> 02:16:15,100
with DC, but that's probably not what I'm asking. Is there a Bob Kane slash Bill

2935
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:19,540
Finger, a Jerry Siegel, you can tell my comic book knowledge is not very good,

2936
02:16:19,540 --> 02:16:25,260
slash Joel Shuster? Who has that level of prominence, or is that indicative of the

2937
02:16:25,260 --> 02:16:30,420
studio's problems? Well, if my only, my only basis on that is with the Lego

2938
02:16:30,420 --> 02:16:36,620
games, and I don't, their equivalent, because Stan Lee was like the, you know,

2939
02:16:36,620 --> 02:16:41,260
collectible guy that was in all of the, you know, Lego Marvel games, and then the

2940
02:16:41,260 --> 02:16:49,020
DC side, it was Adam West. So, that doesn't really work now. I don't really think

2941
02:16:49,020 --> 02:16:54,180
there is anybody that's kind of like that. But then again, I'm not a huge DC fan, so

2942
02:16:54,220 --> 02:16:59,580
fuck if I know. That, that DC side's all fucking mess right now. At least in the,

2943
02:16:59,580 --> 02:17:05,100
like, entertainment world, it's just kind of, they don't know what the fuck they're

2944
02:17:05,100 --> 02:17:09,380
doing. Okay, so thank, thank God to having a chat room that can help me out here,

2945
02:17:09,380 --> 02:17:13,060
because I don't know a lot about comics. Fifth Dream in chat says, DC doesn't have

2946
02:17:13,060 --> 02:17:17,980
that face. Ironically, closest thing is another Lee, Jim, and Captain Spike agrees

2947
02:17:17,980 --> 02:17:21,300
that I was gonna say Jim Lee. Captain Spike also saying, I'm trying to play

2948
02:17:21,340 --> 02:17:27,820
Spidey and Dragon Quest XI. Both amazing games paired with, wow, I'm so game ADD

2949
02:17:27,820 --> 02:17:32,500
right now. You know, hashtag the struggle. Tiger Claw says, there's a Stan Lee cameo

2950
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:35,620
in Spider-Man. Of course there is. Of course there is. So, there you go. You know,

2951
02:17:35,620 --> 02:17:41,100
speaking of, Matt, here's how I can tie it. There was a Stan Lee cameo in the Teen

2952
02:17:41,100 --> 02:17:44,700
Titans Go movie. There's a Stan Lee cameo in everything. And it was hilarious. All

2953
02:17:44,700 --> 02:17:47,300
right, there's gonna be a Stan Lee cameo on this show, hopefully, before it ends.

2954
02:17:47,740 --> 02:17:52,380
All right, so here's the thing. Here's the thing. One thing I can talk about is the

2955
02:17:52,380 --> 02:17:57,020
video game stuff. And what about like faces of companies? Because like with

2956
02:17:57,020 --> 02:18:03,060
Nintendo, you've got like, you know, obviously, Miyamoto, Reggie Fils-Aime, you

2957
02:18:03,060 --> 02:18:07,420
know, when, why many people were so effective when Iwata passed as he was

2958
02:18:07,420 --> 02:18:10,620
really, you know, the face when it came to the directs and so forth. And they have,

2959
02:18:10,620 --> 02:18:14,620
they have Nintendo has a new president now. That was him in that direct, wasn't

2960
02:18:14,620 --> 02:18:18,460
it? That led that direct. That was the new Nintendo president, wasn't it? It

2961
02:18:18,460 --> 02:18:21,500
looked like him. I didn't, the problem is I didn't catch the very, very beginning.

2962
02:18:21,500 --> 02:18:27,540
Maybe somebody else can. Yeah. Um, but anyway. Oh yes. Thank you. Bobby Blackwolf

2963
02:18:27,540 --> 02:18:30,220
does confirm it was the new president. Cause I remember they had picked a

2964
02:18:30,220 --> 02:18:34,300
younger guy and you know, so that was him. So anyway. Um, so you know, Nintendo

2965
02:18:34,300 --> 02:18:37,460
kind of has our faces. Microsoft has like, I don't know, like Major Nelson,

2966
02:18:37,700 --> 02:18:39,780
especially when it comes to like social media, it's kind of like the face of

2967
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:47,820
Microsoft. What does Sony have? Ridge Racer. I guess like it's Ridge Racer.

2968
02:18:47,860 --> 02:18:52,660
There's the whole PlayStation blog folks, you know, there's a variety, there's a

2969
02:18:52,660 --> 02:18:56,620
whole variety. There's people there, you know, they, and they kind of, you know, I

2970
02:18:56,620 --> 02:18:59,820
don't know, like you see them at E3, but they're, you know, they got the, they got

2971
02:18:59,820 --> 02:19:04,380
the stuff that they have online parody account, but then that's gone. Yeah. So

2972
02:19:04,380 --> 02:19:07,300
what do they have left? Nothing. I don't know. Like it's just, I don't know. It

2973
02:19:07,300 --> 02:19:11,380
doesn't feel the same. It's not one person. It's, it's a, you have to

2974
02:19:11,380 --> 02:19:14,740
understand that the PlayStation brand is so strong. They don't need

2975
02:19:14,740 --> 02:19:18,780
representatives like that to help bolster the, you know, the appearance of

2976
02:19:18,780 --> 02:19:21,660
the PlayStation brand, the PlayStation branches. It's, it's its own

2977
02:19:21,660 --> 02:19:26,820
spokesperson. But that being said though, the best spokesperson that they

2978
02:19:26,820 --> 02:19:31,940
had was the fake CEO or whatever. No, uh, the vice president, the fake vice

2979
02:19:31,940 --> 02:19:37,020
president guy that was, uh, he was an actor. It was, I forget his name, but

2980
02:19:37,020 --> 02:19:41,100
like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Fucking awesome. They just made him the real vice

2981
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:46,940
president cause he's fucking Kevin Butler is long live Kevin Butler. Um,

2982
02:19:46,940 --> 02:19:52,220
let's see, uh, Sony has David Jaffe says, uh, Bobby black Wolf. I don't know

2983
02:19:52,220 --> 02:19:57,820
if that's the same thing though. Anyway, I guess it doesn't really matter. I'm

2984
02:19:57,820 --> 02:20:01,100
just getting curious. Video games kind of have their faces too. All right,

2985
02:20:01,340 --> 02:20:05,660
let's get to an email from the day before the canceled show. So September

2986
02:20:05,660 --> 02:20:10,500
8th and this is from while I are who says, hello, LR, by the time you read

2987
02:20:10,500 --> 02:20:12,980
this, I'll finally have caught up on the episodes I missed while we had a

2988
02:20:12,980 --> 02:20:16,380
newborn. Well, babies are important. Uh, but of course I had the email about

2989
02:20:16,380 --> 02:20:19,780
some things you probably forgot about already during rapid fire news in early

2990
02:20:19,780 --> 02:20:24,300
August. I can't remember last week. Here's the email where you get called

2991
02:20:24,300 --> 02:20:30,300
out on all this shit we did wrong over the guys in episode two. I have the

2992
02:20:30,340 --> 02:20:36,540
following list of problematic incidents from the past. I'm teasing why we love

2993
02:20:36,540 --> 02:20:40,020
why we'll allow it. Yeah, we're only allowing it because of why we are all

2994
02:20:40,020 --> 02:20:44,740
right during rapid fire news. Sorry, probably black hole says this is an

2995
02:20:44,740 --> 02:20:50,220
airing of grievances. All right, no, you're wrong. That's an Aaron of

2996
02:20:50,220 --> 02:20:55,460
grievance. Okay, here comes why we are during rapid fire news in early August.

2997
02:20:55,500 --> 02:21:00,380
Loki expressed enthusiasm at the success of indie 3d platformer a hat in

2998
02:21:00,380 --> 02:21:04,700
time and said he was looking forward to trying it himself. Before that happens, I

2999
02:21:04,700 --> 02:21:07,580
want to make sure you're aware of some issues with the people behind the game.

3000
02:21:07,700 --> 02:21:13,060
Oh shit, this really is about problematic stuff. Oh, that'll teach me

3001
02:21:13,060 --> 02:21:16,940
to make a joke before I read the rest. Let's go. Let's hear about it. All

3002
02:21:16,940 --> 02:21:20,460
right here. First of all, you may remember someone by the name of John

3003
02:21:20,460 --> 02:21:25,140
Jafari, or perhaps you know him by his nickname, John Tron. Oh, I've heard

3004
02:21:25,140 --> 02:21:29,380
of it. I already know where this is going now. Uh, if you need a refresher,

3005
02:21:29,380 --> 02:21:32,660
he's a popular YouTube personality. And early last year, there was a bit of

3006
02:21:32,660 --> 02:21:36,180
an uproar when he went on several openly racist rants. You may also

3007
02:21:36,180 --> 02:21:39,820
remember the indie platformer ukulele had cast John Tron to deliver some

3008
02:21:39,820 --> 02:21:43,020
voice work for the game following his racist rants and the outcry that

3009
02:21:43,020 --> 02:21:46,380
followed the ukulele developers did the right thing and scrubbed John Tron's

3010
02:21:46,380 --> 02:21:49,940
voice in the game. Guess what? John Tron also did voice work for a hat in

3011
02:21:49,940 --> 02:21:52,580
time. You'd expect that the folks in charge of this game would have done

3012
02:21:52,580 --> 02:21:55,660
the right thing. But not only did they not remove his voice, they never

3013
02:21:55,660 --> 02:21:59,260
even offered a statement regarding John Tron as racist behavior or their

3014
02:21:59,260 --> 02:22:02,060
decision to keep his voice in their game. I interpret this as an

3015
02:22:02,060 --> 02:22:05,140
acceptance or perhaps even an endorsement of this behavior by the

3016
02:22:05,140 --> 02:22:08,380
games lead developers. If this wasn't enough, you should also know that the

3017
02:22:08,380 --> 02:22:11,020
lead game designer was previously involved in a dispute with a former

3018
02:22:11,020 --> 02:22:14,580
colleague. When the dispute was not resolved to their liking, they decided

3019
02:22:14,580 --> 02:22:18,060
to create a slander website for the purpose of doxing this person

3020
02:22:18,260 --> 02:22:22,260
prominently featuring their personal contact information. Now I'm sure that

3021
02:22:22,260 --> 02:22:25,420
many other people contributed a lot of hard work to this game artists,

3022
02:22:25,420 --> 02:22:28,580
musicians, other voice actors, programmers, designers and so forth.

3023
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:31,540
But it's likely that they've already been paid for their work. And then

3024
02:22:31,540 --> 02:22:33,940
when you buy a copy of this game, the money is going to the people at the

3025
02:22:33,940 --> 02:22:37,540
top of it. Exactly the people who I don't want to give my money to. So I

3026
02:22:37,540 --> 02:22:40,860
will never buy it. I will never play it. I've been trying my best to spread

3027
02:22:40,860 --> 02:22:43,340
the word about it. And I encourage potential buyers to take their money

3028
02:22:43,340 --> 02:22:46,420
somewhere elsewhere instead. Let me ask you a tricky quote because the

3029
02:22:46,420 --> 02:22:49,500
rest of his email gets another point. Why is Mr. Smoosh jumping up on the

3030
02:22:49,500 --> 02:22:53,500
table like he's going to jump up on Loki's little mini table there that he

3031
02:22:53,500 --> 02:22:56,820
uses with his laptop? Maybe he will. Maybe he will. All right. Let's see

3032
02:22:56,820 --> 02:22:59,860
what happens. I think he might know. He's like, fuck that. All right. I'm

3033
02:22:59,860 --> 02:23:05,660
sorry. Sorry. My cat is far more interesting than fucking racist assholes

3034
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:11,860
on the internet. Anyway. Okay. So Loki, let me ask you this question. Is it

3035
02:23:11,860 --> 02:23:15,700
then acceptable to steal the game under these circumstances? Is piracy

3036
02:23:15,700 --> 02:23:18,420
justified in this case? No, don't answer that. Don't answer. That's a

3037
02:23:18,420 --> 02:23:21,060
slippery slope. I don't want to go down. I don't answer it. Don't. It's

3038
02:23:21,060 --> 02:23:24,980
the same reason. Like, you know, I'm still going to watch like mission

3039
02:23:24,980 --> 02:23:29,140
impossible, even though I don't necessarily, I don't endorse, you know,

3040
02:23:29,140 --> 02:23:34,260
Scientology or anything like that. When, when can I like draw the line

3041
02:23:34,260 --> 02:23:37,420
between the people that make the content and the content itself? Like,

3042
02:23:37,420 --> 02:23:40,620
when can I just say, I just want to enjoy the content without the drama

3043
02:23:40,620 --> 02:23:43,980
behind the content? Like, I don't need to know the personal backgrounds of

3044
02:23:44,060 --> 02:23:46,460
all these, which is why you said you were interested in the game in the

3045
02:23:46,460 --> 02:23:48,980
first place, because you had no idea about any of this stuff. You're just

3046
02:23:48,980 --> 02:23:53,620
like, Oh, this looks neat. Exactly. Like, I, I don't need that. I don't

3047
02:23:53,620 --> 02:23:56,020
need to know the resumes of all the people that fucking worked at the

3048
02:23:56,020 --> 02:23:59,660
country and all, or the company and all the bad shit that they did here. So

3049
02:23:59,660 --> 02:24:02,380
there's enough bad shit out there. There is, there is a lot of bad shit

3050
02:24:02,380 --> 02:24:05,980
out here. And like, it's like, I totally kind of get what YYR is saying.

3051
02:24:05,980 --> 02:24:08,260
Like now that I'm hearing all this, I'm like, well, I didn't know much

3052
02:24:08,260 --> 02:24:11,740
about this game and now I don't really want to, well, you're probably in

3053
02:24:11,740 --> 02:24:14,340
luck because I'm going to be probably too lazy to buy it. Anyway,

3054
02:24:14,340 --> 02:24:17,060
unless it comes in a humble bundle sale or something like that. So it's

3055
02:24:17,060 --> 02:24:19,940
fine. I probably won't end up actually playing it. I just said it looked

3056
02:24:19,940 --> 02:24:23,460
neat. Like I saw it actually was on sale this week and I was like, yeah,

3057
02:24:23,500 --> 02:24:28,460
not, not sale enough. So I, I didn't end up purchasing it, but it still

3058
02:24:28,460 --> 02:24:31,220
looks neat. But once again, it's a neat game that I'm not going to have

3059
02:24:31,220 --> 02:24:35,060
time to play anyway. So, you know, there's a lot of other neat games that

3060
02:24:35,060 --> 02:24:38,780
come out before that. We think, you know, Spiderman, red dead redemption

3061
02:24:38,780 --> 02:24:41,820
right around the fucking corner. Like Jesus Christ, never going to have

3062
02:24:41,820 --> 02:24:43,020
time to play any of these games.

3063
02:24:43,100 --> 02:24:47,980
Can everybody just try harder to not be an asshole? Like how, like, do you,

3064
02:24:48,020 --> 02:24:52,860
do you know how easy it is to not say racist things? It's really easy.

3065
02:24:53,140 --> 02:24:56,220
Don't say them. You just don't say them.

3066
02:24:56,220 --> 02:24:58,140
But then I have to stop taking my ambient.

3067
02:25:01,420 --> 02:25:05,620
No Loki. That's not how it works. Ambien does not make you racist. Ambien

3068
02:25:05,620 --> 02:25:08,180
does not make you racist contrary to what some, you know, former

3069
02:25:08,180 --> 02:25:12,260
entertainers, uh, from yesteryear will try to tell you. Just, just why,

3070
02:25:12,820 --> 02:25:16,620
just can't people in general, just like not be racist. Like it's really

3071
02:25:16,620 --> 02:25:22,300
easy to not be racist. You just don't be racist and don't commit sexual

3072
02:25:22,300 --> 02:25:27,900
assault. Yes. That's yeah. They don't, don't rape. I mean, it's such a, I

3073
02:25:27,900 --> 02:25:30,700
mean, I know we don't teach people this. What we do teach people is how

3074
02:25:30,700 --> 02:25:33,940
to avoid being raped, but what we should teach people is like, maybe

3075
02:25:33,940 --> 02:25:37,500
just maybe don't do that. Don't. And like, I'm, I'm, I'm not trying to

3076
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:39,980
make light of it. Like, this isn't even a joke. I'm like saying, don't,

3077
02:25:39,980 --> 02:25:43,500
don't do it. You all know. I know you all are, you guys listening out there.

3078
02:25:43,500 --> 02:25:49,500
Remember the three R's. Okay. The three R's don't rape. Don't be racist.

3079
02:25:49,700 --> 02:25:55,180
Don't rep for Scientology. Okay. I kind of think two of those things are

3080
02:25:55,180 --> 02:25:58,820
far worse than one, but a fair enough. All right. Uh, let's see. Going to

3081
02:25:58,820 --> 02:26:02,980
chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Uh, Puba in chat says everyone has

3082
02:26:02,980 --> 02:26:05,900
their personal subjective lines. I think it's okay for YYR to boycott.

3083
02:26:05,900 --> 02:26:10,300
And I think it's okay to low key to not care. Um, and what's interesting,

3084
02:26:10,300 --> 02:26:13,980
YYR says, I'll eat Chick-fil-A when they're open on Sunday. So Jesus

3085
02:26:13,980 --> 02:26:16,940
Christ, I wish they would open on Sunday because they're just pretty

3086
02:26:16,940 --> 02:26:21,340
good. Like, I don't get why they, so here's the thing, and this might

3087
02:26:21,340 --> 02:26:25,020
surprise you. I'm not one of those people that's up and up to like, I'm

3088
02:26:25,020 --> 02:26:28,940
not, even though I get that Chick-fil-A has their, their president has

3089
02:26:28,940 --> 02:26:32,780
donated money to anti LGBT causes. And I think that's fucking gross.

3090
02:26:33,100 --> 02:26:36,140
I think a lot of people have donated money to anti LGBT causes and that's

3091
02:26:36,140 --> 02:26:41,860
also fucking gross. And what works is education. The boycotts don't

3092
02:26:41,860 --> 02:26:45,580
really work in that regard. I mean, and that's kind of on both sides of

3093
02:26:45,580 --> 02:26:49,260
the fence, like the Chick-fil-A slot or, or look, look at Nike. Their

3094
02:26:49,260 --> 02:26:52,780
shares are up like 34 or there. Yeah. Their, their stock value is up like

3095
02:26:52,780 --> 02:26:57,180
34% with all those people like burning their shoes and shit because, which

3096
02:26:57,180 --> 02:27:03,700
by the way, remember what we said, don't be racist. But anyway, um, trying

3097
02:27:03,700 --> 02:27:06,140
to, try to avoid a slippery slope, but it's really hard sometimes you

3098
02:27:06,140 --> 02:27:10,660
guys. Uh, anyway, my, my thought with the whole Chick-fil-A thing is I, I

3099
02:27:10,660 --> 02:27:14,140
do eat Chick-fil-A because here's the thing, like the local franchise

3100
02:27:14,140 --> 02:27:17,020
owner, and you can look this up for yourself, actually donates to pro

3101
02:27:17,020 --> 02:27:21,260
LGBT causes here locally to offset some of the stuff that the corporate

3102
02:27:21,260 --> 02:27:26,060
does. I have many gay friends who worked at Chick-fil-A who've said

3103
02:27:26,060 --> 02:27:29,340
that their experiences were actually really positive. They were treated

3104
02:27:29,340 --> 02:27:32,980
well and all this other stuff. So like, I'm not, excuse me, I, I hate, I

3105
02:27:32,980 --> 02:27:36,500
hate the fact that the money has gone to anti LGBT causes, but I have

3106
02:27:36,500 --> 02:27:41,820
also seen just from myself that, um, I have been able to change many more

3107
02:27:41,820 --> 02:27:46,460
minds by sharing my story, by sharing like who I am and the fact that

3108
02:27:46,540 --> 02:27:51,340
being gay is not a choice. It is the way that, you know, the, the same

3109
02:27:51,340 --> 02:27:54,860
God that you believe in made me just like he made you and all that stuff.

3110
02:27:54,860 --> 02:27:58,140
And, and these things are, are, you know, it's, it's my life that people

3111
02:27:58,140 --> 02:28:02,140
are trying to, you know, be against with, with things like conversion

3112
02:28:02,140 --> 02:28:05,820
therapy and all this garbage stuff out there. I think education goes a

3113
02:28:05,820 --> 02:28:09,740
much farther way than you're canceled because you eat Chick-fil-A.

3114
02:28:11,380 --> 02:28:14,060
That's just kind of my take on the whole thing. I would rather educate

3115
02:28:14,060 --> 02:28:19,380
people as to why, you know, anti LGBT causes are, uh, honestly, it's a

3116
02:28:19,380 --> 02:28:23,460
waste of money in one regard. But anyway, that's a whole nother thing.

3117
02:28:24,420 --> 02:28:28,620
Uh, act-deaf in chat says, I know many LGBT people that go to Coachella

3118
02:28:28,620 --> 02:28:31,140
each year, despite the parent company that owns the festival, donates to

3119
02:28:31,140 --> 02:28:36,860
anti LGBT causes. Um, so you know what, and, and, and, and honestly, if

3120
02:28:36,860 --> 02:28:40,020
you're going to send that email to me that talks about how you can't

3121
02:28:40,020 --> 02:28:42,420
believe that I just sat here and said, sure, I'll eat Chick-fil-A.

3122
02:28:42,420 --> 02:28:45,540
Okay. I don't eat it every day. Uh, but I'll eat it once in a while.

3123
02:28:45,700 --> 02:28:49,460
Uh, if you're about to send me that thing, um, just know you're giving me

3124
02:28:49,460 --> 02:28:52,300
an invite to come through your house so I can point out everything

3125
02:28:52,300 --> 02:28:57,260
problematic that you own. I think in my, my mind, I guess my point is

3126
02:28:57,260 --> 02:29:00,980
the question is not like the boycotting and the don't do this. And that's

3127
02:29:00,980 --> 02:29:04,940
like, that's only going to go so far. What are we really doing to change

3128
02:29:04,940 --> 02:29:08,300
minds? Cause honestly, one of the first things I'm always going to ask

3129
02:29:08,300 --> 02:29:10,540
you when you tell me there's like a problem with the world, so I'm going

3130
02:29:10,540 --> 02:29:12,780
to say, do you vote? Did you vote?

3131
02:29:12,820 --> 02:29:16,700
Well, and the other thing too, like, not this, not to like play down

3132
02:29:16,700 --> 02:29:22,140
anything. I think there's these issues are out there. They've been

3133
02:29:22,140 --> 02:29:25,900
always out there. It's just now it's more prevalent because of social

3134
02:29:25,900 --> 02:29:30,420
media. Like I wouldn't say, I'm not going to say that all of the game

3135
02:29:30,420 --> 02:29:33,380
companies and all the games beforehand, all the teams that have worked

3136
02:29:33,380 --> 02:29:38,060
on, they've been squeaky clean and we should, we avoid games based on

3137
02:29:38,060 --> 02:29:41,820
that and like, God, now that we know, I guess as we could boycott it,

3138
02:29:42,220 --> 02:29:44,980
I'm just going to boycott it out of laziness just because I'm probably

3139
02:29:44,980 --> 02:29:49,660
not going to get around to it ever. But, um, I don't know. It's just

3140
02:29:49,660 --> 02:29:54,740
like, I just, it's too much for me to focus on. Why can't I just play

3141
02:29:54,740 --> 02:29:55,100
games?

3142
02:29:55,180 --> 02:29:59,100
Well, here's the thing, like, you know what, if you want to make an

3143
02:29:59,100 --> 02:30:01,700
informed decision and that's, you know, especially as I was seeing all

3144
02:30:01,700 --> 02:30:04,260
this, and then I'm telling you my honest reaction to this when I'm

3145
02:30:04,260 --> 02:30:07,180
seeing YYR's email, I'm like, Hmm, I wasn't really following this game.

3146
02:30:07,180 --> 02:30:09,820
And you know what, now I'm just not going to, you know, I've got a

3147
02:30:09,820 --> 02:30:12,980
million other games to play right now. I don't, you know, this one is

3148
02:30:12,980 --> 02:30:16,020
just like, yeah, it's not going to be something I'm going to go seek out

3149
02:30:16,020 --> 02:30:19,140
now. You know what I mean? That's right. And so there's nothing wrong

3150
02:30:19,140 --> 02:30:22,140
with making an informed decision. You choose how you want to spend

3151
02:30:22,140 --> 02:30:22,780
your money.

3152
02:30:22,780 --> 02:30:25,580
Besides, there's the other one that was, uh, it's not hat in time.

3153
02:30:25,580 --> 02:30:30,500
There's one that's, uh, freeze me. That's also another like 3d

3154
02:30:30,500 --> 02:30:34,580
platform again. That's pretty good. Okay. So we'll pick a freeze me

3155
02:30:34,580 --> 02:30:35,100
instead.

3156
02:30:35,140 --> 02:30:40,660
Yeah. All right. Anyhow. Uh, moving on. It just sucks that we, I live

3157
02:30:40,660 --> 02:30:43,500
in this constant fear of like, what I just said is going to get me

3158
02:30:43,500 --> 02:30:46,460
canceled. You know what I mean? Like, that's just the, like the

3159
02:30:46,460 --> 02:30:46,940
society.

3160
02:30:47,100 --> 02:30:51,260
Let's check with the higher ups on the board. Nope, we got no board.

3161
02:30:51,300 --> 02:30:56,180
What happened to just, what happened to just educating? What happened to

3162
02:30:56,180 --> 02:30:56,900
learning?

3163
02:30:57,500 --> 02:31:00,540
Well, didn't you know this current administration things learning is

3164
02:31:00,540 --> 02:31:06,300
bad. Science facts bad. Anyway, I'm not, I know I do. I just want to

3165
02:31:06,300 --> 02:31:09,900
make it very clear. I totally respect the email and I do. I appreciate

3166
02:31:09,900 --> 02:31:13,260
the informed decision because like I said, now I know, Oh, this is a

3167
02:31:13,260 --> 02:31:16,020
game. Just, it wasn't even on my radar and now it's just not going to,

3168
02:31:16,100 --> 02:31:21,140
there's so many games. Yeah, exactly. All right. Anyhow, moving on to a,

3169
02:31:21,140 --> 02:31:26,020
there was a second update from YYR that came in on September 9th

3170
02:31:26,020 --> 02:31:29,860
Dreamcast day that says, hello, LR. I know you probably just got done

3171
02:31:29,860 --> 02:31:33,020
with an email from me. Fooled you. We didn't have a show, but I'm

3172
02:31:33,020 --> 02:31:35,260
listening to the latest episode of the airport. I just want to clarify

3173
02:31:35,260 --> 02:31:39,420
something. Xbox game pass is not a streaming service. You download an

3174
02:31:39,420 --> 02:31:43,700
entire game to your Xbox one after which you can play it. That is the

3175
02:31:43,700 --> 02:31:47,460
only way game pass works. Streaming is not an available option. And at

3176
02:31:47,460 --> 02:31:50,500
the present time, Microsoft does not offer game streaming service for

3177
02:31:50,500 --> 02:31:54,180
the Xbox one. Good. Cause it sucks. I'm glad that they don't have

3178
02:31:54,180 --> 02:31:58,180
streaming. It should all be download. I'm down with that. I'm download

3179
02:31:58,180 --> 02:32:01,780
with that. The only Xbox streaming that currently exists is the ability

3180
02:32:01,780 --> 02:32:05,460
to stream from your Xbox one to your PC, but that's something entirely

3181
02:32:05,460 --> 02:32:07,940
different. Anyway, that's it. And I hope you guys have a great week.

3182
02:32:08,740 --> 02:32:11,460
Why am I saying fuck that stupid PlayStation now? I swear to God, I

3183
02:32:11,460 --> 02:32:15,620
hate that shit. If you can download games, which by the way is a rumor,

3184
02:32:15,620 --> 02:32:20,500
apparently that they are going to have downloadable games on the

3185
02:32:20,500 --> 02:32:24,180
PlayStation. Now, apparently it came up on one of the things that likes

3186
02:32:24,180 --> 02:32:28,900
to download this title. So that's something interesting, but I don't

3187
02:32:28,900 --> 02:32:33,620
know. Um, yeah, I don't know if that's going to actually become a thing

3188
02:32:33,620 --> 02:32:38,020
pretty soon. Okay. Uh, I, Y Y R is in chat and correctly stated. I

3189
02:32:38,020 --> 02:32:40,980
forgot to finish the last email cause we got on such a tangent about

3190
02:32:40,980 --> 02:32:43,780
cancel coach culture and all that. I forgot to finish his first email.

3191
02:32:43,780 --> 02:32:46,740
So let me finish the first email that said moving on to something else

3192
02:32:46,740 --> 02:32:50,100
in mid August, in response to the rumor that new super Mario, you was

3193
02:32:50,100 --> 02:32:55,620
on its way to switch, which it is spoiler alert. It is, uh, you guys

3194
02:32:55,620 --> 02:32:58,660
wondered why it couldn't have been super Mario maker instead spoiler

3195
02:32:58,660 --> 02:33:01,540
alert. It wasn't all right. All right. I'm done with that. Uh, I believe

3196
02:33:01,540 --> 02:33:04,740
that the answer to this is simple. New super Mario. You simply has to

3197
02:33:04,740 --> 02:33:08,100
come first. It's the same reason why Konami would never release a version

3198
02:33:08,100 --> 02:33:11,860
of DDR that lets you add your own songs. Because if they did, what

3199
02:33:11,860 --> 02:33:15,540
would be the point of releasing another version in the same way, if you

3200
02:33:15,540 --> 02:33:18,660
can create or download the levels of super Mario maker, why would you

3201
02:33:18,660 --> 02:33:24,340
buy new super Mario? You, uh, P chat. Should I said spoiler? Oh, I

3202
02:33:24,340 --> 02:33:28,100
forget. Uh, I personally trust the rumor that super Mario maker marks

3203
02:33:28,100 --> 02:33:31,220
the end of the 2d series for now. So to me, it makes sense to release

3204
02:33:31,220 --> 02:33:35,380
the final proper game before its creation tool, as opposed to after

3205
02:33:35,380 --> 02:33:39,460
it. Finally, I wanted to express my gratitude. I heard every mention

3206
02:33:39,460 --> 02:33:42,260
of super multitasking you made, Rob, and I really appreciate the

3207
02:33:42,260 --> 02:33:45,780
plugs. Every single one. I have so much gratitude for the fact that

3208
02:33:45,780 --> 02:33:48,420
you're enthusiastically recommending my work at every possible

3209
02:33:48,420 --> 02:33:52,900
opportunity and allow me to do so again. That was my words, not his in

3210
02:33:52,900 --> 02:33:56,100
the email. Allow me to do so again, super multitasking on steam. Uh, so

3211
02:33:56,100 --> 02:33:59,060
for that, thank you very much. You're welcome very much. But one last

3212
02:33:59,060 --> 02:34:04,820
thing is in no way whatsoever. Super Mario 64 overrated fight me.

3213
02:34:04,820 --> 02:34:08,180
Please don't actually fight me. Why we are and everybody with that

3214
02:34:08,180 --> 02:34:11,460
comment, super multitasking is canceled. No, I'm just kidding. Of

3215
02:34:11,460 --> 02:34:14,580
course. I'm kidding. Of course. I'm getting everyone's welcome to

3216
02:34:14,580 --> 02:34:18,420
their own opinion. All right. There we go. That's it for emails tonight.

3217
02:34:18,420 --> 02:34:21,140
Thank you so much to all our emails. If you want to send us an email for

3218
02:34:21,140 --> 02:34:24,900
a future week, participate at orange lounge, radio.com. But in the

3219
02:34:24,900 --> 02:34:29,860
meanwhile, we have some more stories to get into, right? Loki. Yes.

3220
02:34:29,860 --> 02:34:35,780
Let's let's talk about some stories, including this ridiculous video

3221
02:34:35,780 --> 02:34:41,460
coming from Microsoft talking about the Xbox one limited edition

3222
02:34:41,460 --> 02:34:46,180
grease poof controller that has to do with, of course, pub G because,

3223
02:34:46,180 --> 02:34:50,980
you know, winner, winner, chicken dinner. Apparently it is covered

3224
02:34:50,980 --> 02:34:55,620
with a impervious degrees urethane coating, and it's going to be a

3225
02:34:55,620 --> 02:34:59,780
limited run. These gray and yellow controllers that are going to be

3226
02:34:59,780 --> 02:35:05,460
available. Apparently the I don't know if this was for a certain

3227
02:35:05,460 --> 02:35:07,780
region. It looks like it had something to do with the Australia,

3228
02:35:07,780 --> 02:35:12,180
New Zealand. It was announced on the Xbox and the Australia,

3229
02:35:12,180 --> 02:35:15,140
New Zealand Facebook page. And they were having some, I think,

3230
02:35:15,140 --> 02:35:21,700
contests in regards to the launch of the game. They're basically

3231
02:35:21,700 --> 02:35:26,020
saying, I guess you have to submit an anecdote about how Greece has

3232
02:35:26,020 --> 02:35:30,340
ruined your gaming experience or something like that. So neat.

3233
02:35:30,340 --> 02:35:32,900
I think those controllers, they should just cover all of the

3234
02:35:32,900 --> 02:35:38,580
controllers with that so that Greece doesn't because gamer hands and

3235
02:35:38,580 --> 02:35:42,340
not necessarily gamer hands, but kid hands. Holy fuck. Are they like

3236
02:35:42,340 --> 02:35:47,380
just nasty shit? I mean, like I my switch right now is fucking

3237
02:35:47,380 --> 02:35:51,380
disgusting. I cleaned off every now and then, but like, I don't know

3238
02:35:51,380 --> 02:35:53,540
what the fuck that they do those things. They touch it with their

3239
02:35:53,540 --> 02:35:57,460
like dirty ass hands. I know what they do. They eat, they eat food and

3240
02:35:57,460 --> 02:36:01,220
play games at the same time and don't wash their hands in between.

3241
02:36:02,020 --> 02:36:05,380
And it's a big no no. And that's how you spread disease. Like what

3242
02:36:05,380 --> 02:36:08,180
we were talking about earlier in the show. Well, yeah, kids are dirty.

3243
02:36:08,180 --> 02:36:10,820
I mean, of course, a disease like that's going to spread everywhere.

3244
02:36:10,820 --> 02:36:16,660
They, you know, I don't know. All right. Well, something you can play

3245
02:36:16,660 --> 02:36:20,340
with your grubby hands on these controllers. Actually, no, because

3246
02:36:20,340 --> 02:36:23,860
this is on the Nintendo Switch, but is the Sega ages classic. That's

3247
02:36:23,860 --> 02:36:28,020
right. Sonic is continuing the Sega ages series. They were announced

3248
02:36:28,020 --> 02:36:31,700
in Famitsu magazine in Japan this week. Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Space

3249
02:36:31,700 --> 02:36:36,340
Harrier, Columns 2, Outrun, and Thunder Force AC going to be made

3250
02:36:36,340 --> 02:36:39,540
available in the Sega ages collection. Columns 2, you're going to be

3251
02:36:39,540 --> 02:36:43,700
able to do online battle. Cool. Outrun will have an arranged soundtrack

3252
02:36:43,700 --> 02:36:46,420
as well as the original music. So don't worry if you're a fan of the

3253
02:36:46,420 --> 02:36:50,180
original. That is not going anywhere. You get both. No prices, no

3254
02:36:50,180 --> 02:36:53,780
confirmation. These are even coming to America. I don't see why they

3255
02:36:53,780 --> 02:36:57,540
wouldn't. And the Switch is region free after all. But as of now, this

3256
02:36:57,540 --> 02:37:01,220
is only confirmed for Japan. I don't think the direct change to any of

3257
02:37:01,220 --> 02:37:04,180
that or any of the subsequent news that I've seen. So anyway, that's

3258
02:37:04,180 --> 02:37:08,180
what's going on with Sega ages. However, I should also point out they

3259
02:37:08,180 --> 02:37:13,620
are actually asking fans their most wanted Sega ages game. So they're

3260
02:37:13,620 --> 02:37:18,340
doing a Twitter survey asking Japanese fans what their most requested

3261
02:37:18,340 --> 02:37:22,500
Sega age game would be. The winner will be announced at Tokyo Game

3262
02:37:22,500 --> 02:37:26,500
Show. And there is a Sega ages stage event on the 22nd of September. So

3263
02:37:26,500 --> 02:37:31,220
we're letting the internet vote on what should, yes, nothing bad ever

3264
02:37:31,220 --> 02:37:36,820
happened with this. Can we vote for Phantasy Star Online 2 Western

3265
02:37:36,820 --> 02:37:40,660
release? Can I write in that vote? Oh wait, that wouldn't work for Sega

3266
02:37:40,660 --> 02:37:46,260
ages. Although, wouldn't like a Phantasy Star offline be a pretty cool

3267
02:37:46,260 --> 02:37:49,460
thing? I guess that really wouldn't work. I'm just making shit up at this

3268
02:37:49,460 --> 02:37:54,900
point. But yeah. Yeah, sg100matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

3269
02:37:55,940 --> 02:37:58,820
Never let the internet vote. Nothing good will come from it. Yeah, that's

3270
02:37:58,820 --> 02:38:01,540
kind of where I was going with this. To which Bobby Blackwell follows up

3271
02:38:01,540 --> 02:38:08,420
with Phantasy Star Online, McPhantasy Star Online face. Yes, that.

3272
02:38:08,420 --> 02:38:12,100
Of course the vote. I mean, I understand Sega ages were like classic

3273
02:38:12,100 --> 02:38:16,660
arcade games, but most of the arcade games are classics now. Yeah. So

3274
02:38:16,660 --> 02:38:24,180
clearly the vote has to be for Daytona. It has to be Daytona.

3275
02:38:24,180 --> 02:38:29,940
Uh, can I vote for Samba de Amigo with the, with the joy con controllers

3276
02:38:29,940 --> 02:38:35,940
as the Sambas? That could work. Right. Uh, anyway, uh, some other folks

3277
02:38:36,020 --> 02:38:41,060
in chatter saying Gunstar Heroes. Yawn. You already got Gunstar Heroes

3278
02:38:41,060 --> 02:38:45,860
on virtual console enough. You know why? And it's been released on other

3279
02:38:45,860 --> 02:38:49,700
platforms. It's time for more Daytona. So what if it's like one of the

3280
02:38:49,700 --> 02:38:56,100
greatest Genesis games always over? Get that later. It's Daytona. Samba de

3281
02:38:56,100 --> 02:39:02,340
Amigo, Daytona. Both at the same time. Let's move on. Loki. Fighters, mega

3282
02:39:02,420 --> 02:39:06,180
mix with all the, like, you know, we'll get all of the characters in

3283
02:39:06,180 --> 02:39:12,900
there and brawl it. Yeah. Anyways. Um, so Epic has dropped video

3284
02:39:12,900 --> 02:39:17,780
capture off of the switch version of Fortnite because of performance

3285
02:39:17,780 --> 02:39:21,220
issues. First off, I was surprised that there was even video capture at

3286
02:39:21,220 --> 02:39:25,380
all on Fortnite on the switch, but apparently it was a thing at one

3287
02:39:25,380 --> 02:39:29,140
time, but apparently it's been affecting the guest gameplay. And so

3288
02:39:29,140 --> 02:39:32,980
because of that, they have patched it out and says, you may have noticed

3289
02:39:32,980 --> 02:39:37,060
we've disabled video capture feature on Nintendo switch as of version

3290
02:39:37,060 --> 02:39:43,300
5.4 0.2, a client update. This was done for performance and stability

3291
02:39:43,300 --> 02:39:47,540
reasons. As we've been seeing a high rate of out of memory related

3292
02:39:47,540 --> 02:39:52,340
crashes disabling this feature saves a significant amount of Ram while

3293
02:39:52,340 --> 02:39:55,060
also having the positive effect on the overall performance across the

3294
02:39:55,060 --> 02:39:58,180
board. Yeah, I think that's fine. Maybe this is why Nintendo didn't

3295
02:39:58,180 --> 02:40:01,860
want to talk about Fortnite at their direct. Who knows? I'm teasing a

3296
02:40:01,860 --> 02:40:06,100
little bit. The fact that they had video capture in there and voice

3297
02:40:06,100 --> 02:40:10,180
chat is pretty fucking impressive considering that hello Nintendo.

3298
02:40:10,180 --> 02:40:14,340
Why does Splatoon not have voice chat built in without using a fucking

3299
02:40:14,340 --> 02:40:18,740
app? Maybe now we know it's, it's got to have some power and you know,

3300
02:40:18,740 --> 02:40:23,140
you're just using too much power to actually come on. Splatoon is not

3301
02:40:23,140 --> 02:40:26,260
that much more of a graphically intensive game than Fortnite, please.

3302
02:40:26,580 --> 02:40:30,180
All right. Uh, Bobby Black Wolf does point out, well, the video capture

3303
02:40:30,180 --> 02:40:33,700
was using the switches native video capture feature, but you know, isn't

3304
02:40:33,700 --> 02:40:36,820
that still a certain amount of Ram in the background that's being taken

3305
02:40:36,820 --> 02:40:41,220
up? Oh, interesting. All right. Anyhow, uh, let's move on to another

3306
02:40:41,220 --> 02:40:44,420
story. This was actually, uh, suggested in our discord. So if you're

3307
02:40:44,420 --> 02:40:47,780
not on our discord server, you should join vog network.com slash

3308
02:40:47,780 --> 02:40:50,900
discord. We'll get you an invite. And there's an orange lounge radio

3309
02:40:50,900 --> 02:40:56,020
channel where this story was passed on about a potential unannounced

3310
02:40:56,100 --> 02:41:00,580
project from Blizzard. So this is kind of rumor-y, but there is some

3311
02:41:00,580 --> 02:41:04,020
proof. There are some receipts behind this rumor. Uh, and it's from

3312
02:41:04,020 --> 02:41:08,500
looking at the Blizzard job site, Blizzard careers. Uh, we know a lot

3313
02:41:08,500 --> 02:41:11,220
of Diablo stuff is in the works right now. Gee, I wonder what could

3314
02:41:11,220 --> 02:41:13,860
be going on. Maybe we'll find out at Blizzcon. It's either an

3315
02:41:13,860 --> 02:41:17,460
expansion or, or the number four might be seen. Who knows? Who knows?

3316
02:41:17,460 --> 02:41:22,180
But anyway, Blizzard also has an unannounced project for people that

3317
02:41:22,180 --> 02:41:27,220
want to build an action packed game with a beautiful visceral core

3318
02:41:27,220 --> 02:41:31,380
combat experience. Uh, the person applying should have a passion for

3319
02:41:31,380 --> 02:41:36,740
co-op games, RPGs, and board games. Uh, they're hiring things like art

3320
02:41:36,740 --> 02:41:38,980
director, character, artists, environment, armist, gameplay

3321
02:41:38,980 --> 02:41:43,460
engineer, and a lead senior level designer position where you can

3322
02:41:43,460 --> 02:41:46,820
actually get some bullet points as to what they're doing, including

3323
02:41:47,860 --> 02:41:51,140
own level design and world building from conception to the final stages

3324
02:41:51,140 --> 02:41:54,740
of polish facilitating communication and coordinating team members to

3325
02:41:54,740 --> 02:41:58,420
ensure the vision is clearly defined and understood. Um, let's see, I'm

3326
02:41:58,420 --> 02:42:02,660
not trying not to read like all of these, but, uh, let's see partnered

3327
02:42:02,660 --> 02:42:05,380
with engineering to define and create tooling that effectively

3328
02:42:05,380 --> 02:42:10,180
compliments Blizzard's world class handcrafted level design. Uh, so

3329
02:42:10,180 --> 02:42:14,180
anyway, uh, some other things that I guess are in the job listings that

3330
02:42:14,180 --> 02:42:19,300
are interesting next gen AI, like motion capture systems, a robust

3331
02:42:19,300 --> 02:42:24,100
first person engine for the game and a unique visual direction. So what

3332
02:42:24,100 --> 02:42:28,980
could this be? Some people speculating it could be a Blizzard's

3333
02:42:28,980 --> 02:42:34,740
answer to, and here's what Blizzard does very well. They take popular

3334
02:42:34,740 --> 02:42:39,060
game genres and make them stupid easily accessible. They've done it

3335
02:42:39,060 --> 02:42:42,420
with trading card games, Hearthstone. They've done it with EverQuest,

3336
02:42:42,420 --> 02:42:45,620
World of Warcraft. They've done it with, you know, they've done it with

3337
02:42:45,700 --> 02:42:50,260
other stuff. So what do you think Blizzard might be tackling now? And

3338
02:42:50,260 --> 02:42:56,020
some people say it is no, not battle royale. This could be Blizzard's

3339
02:42:56,020 --> 02:43:00,180
battle royale project. What do you think? Stop jumping on that train.

3340
02:43:00,180 --> 02:43:04,100
It's I think it's already gone. You know, what's interesting. Be an

3341
02:43:04,100 --> 02:43:08,660
innovator, not like a copier. I remember, I don't know how I remember

3342
02:43:08,660 --> 02:43:14,900
this, but I remember on a hoard house a long time ago, there was rumors

3343
02:43:14,900 --> 02:43:18,740
that Titan, which as we know became Overwatch, essentially Titan was

3344
02:43:18,740 --> 02:43:22,340
canceled. And from the grave of the assets and things like that, that's

3345
02:43:22,340 --> 02:43:26,100
where Overwatch came from. I think Overwatch, the battling was supposed

3346
02:43:26,100 --> 02:43:30,980
to be like once part of the Titan game. But anyway, my point is I

3347
02:43:30,980 --> 02:43:34,340
remember one of the early rumors about Titan. What is that was that it

3348
02:43:34,340 --> 02:43:38,740
was a James Bond-esque spy game. It was a spy versus spy type of game as

3349
02:43:38,740 --> 02:43:45,300
Nespionage spy type of game. I mean, Team Fortress 2? I don't know.

3350
02:43:45,300 --> 02:43:49,780
Could this be like a James Bond-y spy type of game? I think that'd be

3351
02:43:49,780 --> 02:43:52,500
because, you know, when I hear like first person, I think, well, they

3352
02:43:52,500 --> 02:43:55,620
kind of already have that with Overwatch. This is going to have to be

3353
02:43:55,620 --> 02:43:59,460
different than Overwatch. So either it's, you know, battle royale-esque

3354
02:43:59,460 --> 02:44:01,780
or it's, you know, something, you know, simply something we haven't seen yet.

3355
02:44:01,780 --> 02:44:08,340
Overwatch 2. It feels early for that. Overwatch, it still feels early to

3356
02:44:08,340 --> 02:44:12,660
say Overwatch 2 because, I mean, I still think if they're going to do

3357
02:44:12,660 --> 02:44:16,740
Overwatch expansions, it's going to be single player because like,

3358
02:44:16,740 --> 02:44:19,380
they're still pumping heroes out there. They've still got, still got

3359
02:44:19,380 --> 02:44:22,740
Overwatch League is a big thing. And you know, that's all kind of built

3360
02:44:22,740 --> 02:44:25,780
into the base Overwatch game. So I'm not sure Blizzard suddenly wants

3361
02:44:25,780 --> 02:44:29,060
to put out Overwatch 2 and disrupt all of that. That doesn't make sense.

3362
02:44:29,060 --> 02:44:33,860
I feel like this really is some type of new type of project. So I don't

3363
02:44:33,860 --> 02:44:39,140
know. Kaijuto says in chat, Overwatch isn't a spy game at all. I know.

3364
02:44:39,140 --> 02:44:41,220
That's my point. Maybe this is.

3365
02:44:44,020 --> 02:44:46,980
ActDeft in chat says, please give us a fucking single player campaign,

3366
02:44:46,980 --> 02:44:49,700
Blizzard. Could be. I mean, that might be why you would need to design

3367
02:44:49,700 --> 02:44:53,220
levels and so forth. Maybe Overwatch is going to go with a single player

3368
02:44:53,220 --> 02:44:58,500
expansion. Who knows? I don't know. Anyway, we'll find out maybe at

3369
02:44:58,500 --> 02:45:01,540
BlizzCon or we might have to wait another year because Blizzard is very

3370
02:45:01,540 --> 02:45:04,660
good at keeping things in the oven until they are very, very, very done.

3371
02:45:05,380 --> 02:45:09,140
Kaijuto in chat does say though, I want a battle royale espionage game.

3372
02:45:09,140 --> 02:45:13,220
I think, yeah, I kind of think it's tie the spy versus spy, James Bond,

3373
02:45:13,220 --> 02:45:17,700
GoldenEye 64, but with battle royale. I think, I don't know. That might be

3374
02:45:17,700 --> 02:45:22,740
kind of rad. We'll see. Everyone's wanting Agent, which is that game

3375
02:45:22,740 --> 02:45:27,620
that was supposed to be. Oh yeah. Rockstar stuff. Oh yeah. I remember

3376
02:45:27,620 --> 02:45:30,180
that. I remember that. All right. Anyway, a few more stories for you

3377
02:45:30,260 --> 02:45:33,380
guys. Then we're going to get to the Skype line for a little bit tonight.

3378
02:45:33,380 --> 02:45:36,180
If you do want to call in though, I encourage you to get in relatively

3379
02:45:36,180 --> 02:45:39,300
quick because, um, I'm not going to keep it open all night cause the

3380
02:45:39,300 --> 02:45:42,020
show's already running a little long. So, but we got some stories to get

3381
02:45:42,020 --> 02:45:46,260
to before we get there. So first Loki. All right. Let's talk about

3382
02:45:46,260 --> 02:45:51,860
uncensored sex. Yes. A hundred percent uncensored sex games.

3383
02:45:52,980 --> 02:45:59,060
Loki, I like you, but I don't like you. So, um, you know, you may remember

3384
02:45:59,060 --> 02:46:02,580
there was a whole like controversy with steam and pulling down games

3385
02:46:02,580 --> 02:46:05,940
off of their service that were like these visual novels and stuff. And

3386
02:46:05,940 --> 02:46:08,420
then they were like, no, no, no, we're not trying to ban anything like

3387
02:46:08,420 --> 02:46:11,620
that. We just don't want people to see anime titty. So now apparently

3388
02:46:11,620 --> 02:46:15,540
they are, they have approved the first a hundred percent, um, uncensored

3389
02:46:15,540 --> 02:46:24,260
game called negligee. And, um, and it is out now, uh, for people to

3390
02:46:24,260 --> 02:46:31,620
check out, but there is one small problem. Apparently the, um, you know,

3391
02:46:31,620 --> 02:46:35,940
the content, some in some countries it would be considered possibly

3392
02:46:35,940 --> 02:46:41,780
illegal. So they have to ban it from certain, um, regions. So for

3393
02:46:41,780 --> 02:46:47,540
example, Belgium, Japan, Malaysia, Botswana, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria,

3394
02:46:47,540 --> 02:46:53,380
South Africa, Sudan, Uganda, Bangladesh, China, Lebanon, South Korea,

3395
02:46:53,380 --> 02:46:59,220
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, um, Belarus, Iceland, Ukraine,

3396
02:46:59,220 --> 02:47:05,220
Russia, Australia, Australia, man, uh, Papua New Guinea, um, Guyana,

3397
02:47:05,780 --> 02:47:10,980
Iraq, Dubai, UAE, and Germany are not going to be able to check out this

3398
02:47:10,980 --> 02:47:17,700
game. And that's made people sad. Well, I mean, they can always pirate

3399
02:47:17,700 --> 02:47:20,980
it. No, I'm just, I'm not going to endorse that, but I just feel like

3400
02:47:21,060 --> 02:47:24,100
that's what's going to happen when you ban something that people will

3401
02:47:24,100 --> 02:47:29,220
find a way to get their anime titty. They will. So I'm just being a

3402
02:47:29,220 --> 02:47:33,220
realist here. People just be, are you interested in a 100% uncensored

3403
02:47:33,220 --> 02:47:36,020
sex games on steam? Are you, are you gonna buy negligee? I don't like

3404
02:47:36,020 --> 02:47:39,700
visual novel games. So probably not, probably not, not enough action

3405
02:47:39,700 --> 02:47:43,380
for you. All right. Well, maybe this will be more up your alley.

3406
02:47:44,340 --> 02:47:50,340
Uh, they are making a game out of the novel series. Goosebumps. You know

3407
02:47:50,340 --> 02:47:56,980
what? You know what the Goosebumps books are, right? I think those have

3408
02:47:56,980 --> 02:48:00,820
been around since like we were in high school and that age. Uh, but

3409
02:48:00,820 --> 02:48:05,380
anyway, Goosebumps the game is on its way on the Nintendo switch. It's

3410
02:48:05,380 --> 02:48:10,020
going to be launching on October 9th from way forward. And that's a way

3411
02:48:10,020 --> 02:48:13,220
forward has been putting out some quality shit. So, uh, this actually

3412
02:48:13,220 --> 02:48:17,540
might be pretty rad. Uh, this action game was originally released in 2015

3413
02:48:17,540 --> 02:48:21,620
as a prequel to the Goosebumps film. Uh, in the game, you are in the

3414
02:48:21,620 --> 02:48:23,940
car- you're in the shoes of a character whose neighborhood has been

3415
02:48:23,940 --> 02:48:28,580
overrun by R.L. Stine's monsters from the Goosebumps series. You have

3416
02:48:28,580 --> 02:48:32,660
to outsmart and use your wits to investigate, uh, the clues and the

3417
02:48:32,660 --> 02:48:37,300
surroundings and figure it all out before it's too late and you get

3418
02:48:37,300 --> 02:48:40,580
eaten by a grew. Oh, wait, that was his org game. But anyway, that is,

3419
02:48:40,580 --> 02:48:45,060
uh, all on its way. So, um, check that out on Nintendo switch, October

3420
02:48:45,060 --> 02:48:51,060
9th. Anyhow, let's get to the calls. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word

3421
02:48:51,060 --> 02:48:54,420
on Skype. If you want to give us a call and talk about, uh, anything

3422
02:48:54,420 --> 02:48:57,940
maybe we have or have not gotten to yet on the program tonight,

3423
02:48:57,940 --> 02:49:00,820
especially since we've been gone for a little bit, maybe you have

3424
02:49:00,820 --> 02:49:03,860
something you wanted to ask us that we missed from the past couple

3425
02:49:03,860 --> 02:49:06,580
weeks. Uh, do we have any, uh, other last minute stories?

3426
02:49:06,580 --> 02:49:10,580
Yes, this is coming from Twitter from Stanley Tucci Mane. And this is

3427
02:49:10,580 --> 02:49:15,060
basically talking about a Silent Hill Enhanced Edition that fans have

3428
02:49:15,060 --> 02:49:19,860
made, because if you may remember, the Silent Hill HD collection sucked.

3429
02:49:20,500 --> 02:49:25,460
So the Silent Hill 2 Enhanced Edition is basically a bunch of

3430
02:49:25,460 --> 02:49:30,020
modifications to the PC version of the game that fixed a lot of the

3431
02:49:30,020 --> 02:49:33,700
issues. It adds widescreen support, a higher resolution display,

3432
02:49:34,500 --> 02:49:38,980
removal of audio bugs, PlayStation 2 quality audio and fog, better

3433
02:49:38,980 --> 02:49:43,940
controller support, and lots more. So you can go check it out.

3434
02:49:44,500 --> 02:49:47,940
That's pretty cool. Um, again, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype. I saw a

3435
02:49:47,940 --> 02:49:50,580
call come in and I just missed it because I was, um, looking at

3436
02:49:50,580 --> 02:49:53,220
Loki when he was talking about this. If you were, um, looking forward

3437
02:49:53,220 --> 02:50:00,260
to that mod, that's enhanced.townofsilenthill.com slash SH2. So go

3438
02:50:00,260 --> 02:50:04,260
check it out there. Okay. Uh, we have a call coming in. Let's get to it.

3439
02:50:04,260 --> 02:50:07,780
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Hello, it's YYR.

3440
02:50:07,780 --> 02:50:09,380
Haven't we heard enough from you already?

3441
02:50:10,180 --> 02:50:12,260
No, I have more grievances. Sorry.

3442
02:50:12,260 --> 02:50:14,260
Fine. Uh, what else shall we hear about?

3443
02:50:15,940 --> 02:50:18,020
Okay. Well, let me begin the airing then.

3444
02:50:18,020 --> 02:50:18,660
All right.

3445
02:50:18,660 --> 02:50:23,860
Wait, hold on. There's a lot. No, no, just kidding. Um, actually I'm

3446
02:50:23,860 --> 02:50:29,860
going to refer to something that you said during your call with Bobby

3447
02:50:29,860 --> 02:50:36,180
on his show last week. Um, and that was when you mentioned Beat Saber

3448
02:50:36,180 --> 02:50:40,260
and you were talking about, um, how, you know, people have just

3449
02:50:40,260 --> 02:50:44,820
put in these stupid hard charts and things like that. Um, you

3450
02:50:44,820 --> 02:50:48,180
mentioned that, uh, that's also kind of part of the reason that

3451
02:50:48,180 --> 02:50:52,260
you're turned off by new DDR, uh, because there's been such an

3452
02:50:52,260 --> 02:50:55,700
emphasis on these high level charts and that's just really not your

3453
02:50:55,700 --> 02:51:01,060
scene. Right. And, uh, well, I'm just going to mention, I mean, the,

3454
02:51:01,700 --> 02:51:05,380
as it is, yes, they are adding a few new hard things to the game

3455
02:51:05,380 --> 02:51:10,580
here and there, but despite that, the majority of new charts being

3456
02:51:10,580 --> 02:51:15,060
added to the game are still in the 13 and below range, which is like

3457
02:51:15,060 --> 02:51:22,260
easy nines, uh, on the old, uh, scale. So there is still a lot of.

3458
02:51:22,260 --> 02:51:26,100
Maybe these scale updates have got me all thrown off because you say

3459
02:51:26,100 --> 02:51:31,540
13 and I go, that's very, I can only do a nine. What do you mean a 13

3460
02:51:31,540 --> 02:51:32,740
is an easy song?

3461
02:51:33,540 --> 02:51:36,580
No, on the new scale max 300 is a 15.

3462
02:51:36,580 --> 02:51:41,140
Oh, wow. Okay. All right. Well, and that's, let's be max 300 was like

3463
02:51:41,140 --> 02:51:45,620
the original ridiculous song. Look, I'm not trying to knock the

3464
02:51:45,620 --> 02:51:48,900
people that are into that. And I hope that's coming through, but I

3465
02:51:48,900 --> 02:51:51,860
hope people kind of understand that it's like when you're a dirty

3466
02:51:51,860 --> 02:51:55,620
casual like me, which is an okay thing to be, you could be a fan of

3467
02:51:55,620 --> 02:52:00,420
DDR and not like, you know, have the stamina to crank out these

3468
02:52:00,740 --> 02:52:04,900
level 15 songs and all this stuff. I've been playing every single

3469
02:52:04,900 --> 02:52:09,540
day, almost every single day for at least 30 to 60 minutes a day.

3470
02:52:09,540 --> 02:52:11,620
And I still don't have the stamina to do, but then again, I play

3471
02:52:11,620 --> 02:52:12,120
doubles. So.

3472
02:52:12,980 --> 02:52:17,540
Wow. You should do max 300 on doubles. Yeah, exactly. Stupid

3473
02:52:17,540 --> 02:52:20,020
noob. That's cause I don't use the bar.

3474
02:52:21,940 --> 02:52:27,940
Okay. So I'll mention this with regard to that. Um, I do, uh, play

3475
02:52:27,940 --> 02:52:32,740
double. So, and yeah, I play max 300 on double occasionally

3476
02:52:32,740 --> 02:52:35,860
too. And to make up for the fact that you have to use both

3477
02:52:35,860 --> 02:52:39,460
sides, the actual step chart is a little less dense than the

3478
02:52:39,460 --> 02:52:43,780
single version. So, but I do hold the bar for it, you know, one

3479
02:52:43,780 --> 02:52:47,140
hand on each bar. Oh my gosh. It's like doing the splits.

3480
02:52:48,100 --> 02:52:54,980
Um, you do. Okay. So DDR prohibits, uh, what in the groove

3481
02:52:54,980 --> 02:52:59,460
calls stretch jumps. That's things like, uh, the left arrow

3482
02:52:59,460 --> 02:53:02,900
on one player side and the right arrow on two player side.

3483
02:53:02,900 --> 02:53:07,300
Yeah. I think the, the furthest you can, the furthest DDR gives

3484
02:53:07,300 --> 02:53:11,860
you is stuff like right on the one player side and up or down

3485
02:53:11,860 --> 02:53:14,900
on the two player side. Like you won't even see right on both

3486
02:53:14,900 --> 02:53:17,860
sides. It, it will not give you that. So don't worry about

3487
02:53:17,860 --> 02:53:21,860
down, down sometimes or up, up. Yeah. I feel like I've seen him

3488
02:53:21,860 --> 02:53:29,620
do up, up 3d is, uh, the, uh, the standard steps have down,

3489
02:53:29,620 --> 02:53:34,660
down, I believe, or they're probably isolated jumps and not

3490
02:53:34,660 --> 02:53:37,300
like right after other notes. Like they're not coming at you

3491
02:53:37,300 --> 02:53:40,260
as fast as they are in other songs. Like jumps like that are

3492
02:53:40,260 --> 02:53:42,340
okay when they're like spaced out. You know what I mean?

3493
02:53:43,620 --> 02:53:47,060
Yeah. I don't remember seeing that in DDR, but, uh, yeah, it's

3494
02:53:47,060 --> 02:53:50,580
a, it's uncommon. Yeah. In the groove though, they just throw

3495
02:53:50,580 --> 02:53:53,620
all kinds of crazy stuff in there because it's in the group

3496
02:53:53,620 --> 02:53:57,060
because in the group fans are crazy. Yeah. I'm not starting

3497
02:53:57,060 --> 02:54:00,820
that war again. I'm just teasing. I'm teasing. But yeah,

3498
02:54:00,820 --> 02:54:04,260
absolutely. And, and nobody in the community from the, you

3499
02:54:04,260 --> 02:54:07,140
know, the beginners all the way up through the super world-class

3500
02:54:07,140 --> 02:54:10,900
experts, nobody looks down on people playing easier stuff.

3501
02:54:10,900 --> 02:54:14,100
Everyone plays what they like and, uh, it's very, uh, it's a

3502
02:54:14,100 --> 02:54:18,660
very positive community and, uh, yeah. That's good. Stay

3503
02:54:18,660 --> 02:54:21,220
positive. And like I mentioned before, you know, so one reason

3504
02:54:21,220 --> 02:54:23,060
I kind of like all the easy stuff and yeah, you know, I know

3505
02:54:23,060 --> 02:54:25,300
a lot of songs have easy stuff, but I feel like, I feel like a

3506
02:54:25,300 --> 02:54:27,460
lot of the stuff I see online is just like all the hard stuff,

3507
02:54:27,460 --> 02:54:29,220
but I guess that's just, you know, people want to brag about

3508
02:54:29,220 --> 02:54:31,700
their accomplishments and all, which is cool. But I think part

3509
02:54:31,700 --> 02:54:33,540
of the reason I like the freestyle stuff is like, oh,

3510
02:54:33,540 --> 02:54:36,020
it's like the easy, but it has finesse. And that's kind of what

3511
02:54:36,020 --> 02:54:38,340
I was saying, kind of the point I was trying to make with the

3512
02:54:38,340 --> 02:54:41,220
beat, beat saber stuff was that it's like, wow, somebody's like

3513
02:54:41,220 --> 02:54:44,420
kind of figured out a way to like grade freestyle sort of,

3514
02:54:44,420 --> 02:54:48,180
which was something that was so, you know, opinion based

3515
02:54:48,180 --> 02:54:51,780
before. It's like now beat saber kind of brings both those

3516
02:54:51,780 --> 02:54:54,980
worlds together, if that makes sense. Yeah. It's kind of neat.

3517
02:54:54,980 --> 02:54:57,380
And when, when I heard your comment about the scoring

3518
02:54:57,380 --> 02:55:00,820
system and, uh, you know, that it takes your movements and

3519
02:55:00,820 --> 02:55:04,420
your finesse into account, I don't know. I think I, I actually

3520
02:55:04,420 --> 02:55:06,820
kind of liked that because it's something different. Yeah.

3521
02:55:06,820 --> 02:55:10,500
Something different, you know, at the end of the day, how many

3522
02:55:10,500 --> 02:55:13,860
of us are really playing for score? I mean, I'm sure, I'm

3523
02:55:13,860 --> 02:55:15,620
sure there's a lot of hardcore music fans. There's gonna be

3524
02:55:15,620 --> 02:55:17,460
people raising their hand here and there. They're saying me,

3525
02:55:17,460 --> 02:55:19,300
me, but I bet there's a lot of people that are going to play

3526
02:55:19,300 --> 02:55:22,740
beat saber just because they just want to play the beat, be

3527
02:55:22,740 --> 02:55:26,180
in the experience. They want to ride the ride. You know what I

3528
02:55:26,180 --> 02:55:31,300
mean? Yeah. Well, I mean, I, I played DDR for score actually.

3529
02:55:31,300 --> 02:55:34,900
But I think, I think with DDR, even there's a lot of people

3530
02:55:34,900 --> 02:55:37,940
that are like, oh, cool. Yeah. DDR is cool. I like that game.

3531
02:55:37,940 --> 02:55:40,260
But they just, when they say that it's like, they, they hop

3532
02:55:40,260 --> 02:55:42,980
on the machine occasionally and play it. And that that's really

3533
02:55:42,980 --> 02:55:45,060
it. You know what I mean? Like, and they, there's nothing wrong

3534
02:55:45,060 --> 02:55:48,660
with that. There's nothing wrong with that. But next time

3535
02:55:48,660 --> 02:55:52,980
you play Ace, I definitely would encourage you to, you know,

3536
02:55:52,980 --> 02:55:56,740
don't just go into the, you know, the extreme folder, the

3537
02:55:56,740 --> 02:56:01,460
Max 2 folder or what have you. But keep, keep holding down that

3538
02:56:01,460 --> 02:56:06,340
up or down button and go to the level sort feature. It's very

3539
02:56:06,340 --> 02:56:08,820
easy to find. You don't have to press any special button

3540
02:56:08,820 --> 02:56:12,260
combination to find it. Go to the level sort. Yeah, because I

3541
02:56:12,260 --> 02:56:16,980
do that pop in music. Yeah. And, and go, go ahead and find,

3542
02:56:16,980 --> 02:56:20,500
you know, and, and what's really neat about DDR Ace is let's say

3543
02:56:20,500 --> 02:56:24,340
you go to level sort 10. So it shows you all the tens, but it

3544
02:56:24,340 --> 02:56:27,620
doesn't just show you the expert tens or the difficult tens. It

3545
02:56:27,620 --> 02:56:31,380
shows you all the tens across all the difficulties. Yeah. No,

3546
02:56:31,380 --> 02:56:33,860
I like that. BeatMania 2DX does that too, which I really like.

3547
02:56:35,060 --> 02:56:37,860
So, but yeah, and you'll find a lot of new songs that way and

3548
02:56:37,860 --> 02:56:39,940
you'll get to play at your level and everything is good,

3549
02:56:39,940 --> 02:56:43,220
except for when they give a chart the wrong difficulty,

3550
02:56:43,220 --> 02:56:46,260
which unfortunately happens a lot, but whatever. Honestly,

3551
02:56:46,260 --> 02:56:49,220
why are though the real answer is instead of going straight to

3552
02:56:49,220 --> 02:56:51,380
the difficulty store, what I usually do is I go straight to

3553
02:56:51,380 --> 02:56:56,420
Ariana Grande. Can't help it. Can't help it. That song is a

3554
02:56:56,420 --> 02:57:00,180
banger. It is. Even if it's like, even if there's like, I

3555
02:57:00,180 --> 02:57:02,740
would much prefer if Into You was the song that was in DDR,

3556
02:57:02,740 --> 02:57:04,420
but that's okay. You know what? We can't, we can't own them

3557
02:57:04,420 --> 02:57:08,980
all. All right. It's funny. I actually found an ITG chart for

3558
02:57:08,980 --> 02:57:13,300
that and it's a remix of the song that's just amazing, but

3559
02:57:13,300 --> 02:57:19,060
the chart is really tricky. So it's like, Oh man. But before I

3560
02:57:19,060 --> 02:57:21,380
go, I just want to address something I saw in chat from

3561
02:57:21,380 --> 02:57:25,300
Dark Tetsuya. You know, DDR is 20 years old this month. And

3562
02:57:25,300 --> 02:57:29,620
what's really interesting is that they did not update DDR

3563
02:57:29,620 --> 02:57:34,660
Ace for like a period of five to six months. And then a few

3564
02:57:34,660 --> 02:57:37,780
months ago, they started just throwing all these new songs

3565
02:57:37,780 --> 02:57:41,060
into the game. And finally, they just dropped a massive

3566
02:57:41,060 --> 02:57:44,340
update like a few weeks ago. And a lot of us in the community

3567
02:57:44,340 --> 02:57:47,860
are starting to think that this is ramping up to a new game

3568
02:57:47,860 --> 02:57:51,140
announcement like any day now. Ooh, that would be fun.

3569
02:57:52,340 --> 02:57:56,260
Especially to commemorate the anniversary. Yeah, exactly. And

3570
02:57:56,260 --> 02:57:59,300
so, you know, and because, you know, earlier in the year, they

3571
02:57:59,300 --> 02:58:01,940
launched Dance Rush Stardom, which hopefully you've had the

3572
02:58:01,940 --> 02:58:03,780
chance to play because it's really fun. No, we should bring

3573
02:58:03,780 --> 02:58:06,420
that to Dave and Buster's because... No, I haven't played

3574
02:58:07,060 --> 02:58:09,860
over here. I've been since... I almost went to round... Okay,

3575
02:58:09,860 --> 02:58:13,140
here's... You're gonna laugh YYR. So I almost went to round

3576
02:58:13,140 --> 02:58:15,380
one over the weekend because I was hanging out with my buddy

3577
02:58:15,380 --> 02:58:18,660
JD and we were talking. He's as into the music games as you

3578
02:58:18,660 --> 02:58:22,020
are. So... Yeah, I know. I played DDR with him when I was in

3579
02:58:22,020 --> 02:58:25,860
San Fran a while back. We were talking about going to round

3580
02:58:25,860 --> 02:58:29,380
one because he doesn't really have a car. So, you know, it's

3581
02:58:29,380 --> 02:58:31,540
hard, a little harder for him to get to round one. But you

3582
02:58:31,540 --> 02:58:34,420
know what? YYR, what ended up happening? We went to Drag

3583
02:58:34,500 --> 02:58:39,140
Queen Brunch instead. I'm sure that was definitely

3584
02:58:39,140 --> 02:58:41,860
entertaining in its own way. It was because the drag queen

3585
02:58:41,860 --> 02:58:47,860
performed Ariana Grande. So, I still got my fix. So, all

3586
02:58:47,860 --> 02:58:50,340
right. Anyway, my friend Emily, go to try to get some more

3587
02:58:50,340 --> 02:58:53,380
calls. But take care, okay? Hey, have a great week. Thanks.

3588
02:58:53,380 --> 02:58:57,380
You too. Bye-bye. Take care. Bye. All right. Orange Lounge

3589
02:58:57,380 --> 02:58:59,780
Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.

3590
02:58:59,780 --> 02:59:03,220
Yeah, true story. Went to Drag Queen Brunch. They just opened

3591
02:59:03,220 --> 02:59:05,700
a Hamburger Mary's in San Francisco which is funny

3592
02:59:05,700 --> 02:59:07,860
because that, yeah, I think they used to have one there

3593
02:59:07,860 --> 02:59:09,620
years ago and then it closed. Now, they have a brand new

3594
02:59:09,620 --> 02:59:12,260
one. They do that kind of stuff there. So, you know, good

3595
02:59:12,260 --> 02:59:18,100
times. Good times. Good way to have a really, oh, I tried to

3596
02:59:18,100 --> 02:59:21,140
pick up that call and it immediately hung up. That's not

3597
02:59:21,140 --> 02:59:24,900
good. Alright, we'll see if we can get one more call in here

3598
02:59:24,900 --> 02:59:28,020
well before we close up shop for the night. Let's get to it

3599
02:59:28,020 --> 02:59:31,380
higher on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Oh my god, Rob.

3600
02:59:32,100 --> 02:59:35,780
Hi. How you doing, Rageinator? What's up? Good. How are you?

3601
02:59:35,780 --> 02:59:40,260
Good. What's on your mind? Well, two, two things. They're

3602
02:59:40,260 --> 02:59:43,780
kind of sort of related. Sorry, I really haven't been around

3603
02:59:43,780 --> 02:59:46,500
too much for the live shows. Unfortunately, real life is

3604
02:59:46,500 --> 02:59:48,740
kind of going in the way. That's okay. We haven't really

3605
02:59:48,740 --> 02:59:53,220
been around either. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I usually try to make a

3606
02:59:53,220 --> 02:59:55,860
habit of, you know, being around for live shows and all

3607
02:59:55,860 --> 02:59:59,140
that. You know, you know, you know, it's been a kind of a

3608
02:59:59,140 --> 03:00:05,780
habit of mine for... Me too. What, ten years plus? But

3609
03:00:05,780 --> 03:00:12,580
anyway, you know, as it relates, you know, to that, you

3610
03:00:12,580 --> 03:00:18,980
know, there's someone very close to me that's into gaming

3611
03:00:18,980 --> 03:00:22,740
that just, you know, started seeing relatively recently.

3612
03:00:22,740 --> 03:00:26,740
She's into horror games predominantly. Oh boy.

3613
03:00:30,420 --> 03:00:33,860
Now, she, you know, she already has Dead by Daylight and

3614
03:00:33,860 --> 03:00:37,780
Resident Evil 7, which I gifted her, and she has already

3615
03:00:37,780 --> 03:00:43,380
played the Fear series and she plays all her games through

3616
03:00:43,380 --> 03:00:50,980
Steam. Now, that being said, what horror games can you name

3617
03:00:50,980 --> 03:00:55,140
off the bat, aside from the ones that are listed, would,

3618
03:00:55,140 --> 03:00:59,620
you know, would you recommend? Rageinator, it's like the

3619
03:00:59,620 --> 03:01:04,260
genre that I play the least because the scares are too much

3620
03:01:04,260 --> 03:01:07,620
for me. Although, I mean, certainly, if she is not playing

3621
03:01:07,620 --> 03:01:10,180
the Five Nights at Freddy's series, those games are

3622
03:01:10,180 --> 03:01:13,060
insanely popular, although some people don't like the jump

3623
03:01:13,060 --> 03:01:16,500
scares. I remember a game from a few years ago called

3624
03:01:16,500 --> 03:01:20,660
Slender Man that people really liked to see me play on Twitch

3625
03:01:20,660 --> 03:01:25,220
because when I would get scared the hell out of, it was

3626
03:01:25,220 --> 03:01:29,620
always a good time. I liked the Friday the 13th game that they

3627
03:01:29,620 --> 03:01:33,460
did, but I kind of think Dead by Daylight kind of took all

3628
03:01:33,460 --> 03:01:36,740
those because it's a very, very similar type of game. I think

3629
03:01:36,740 --> 03:01:39,460
it kind of already took those people away because then

3630
03:01:39,460 --> 03:01:42,020
Friday the 13th ran into all these problems where suddenly

3631
03:01:42,020 --> 03:01:44,340
like the movie licensing was an issue and all this stuff. So, I

3632
03:01:44,340 --> 03:01:47,140
think that game is kind of like kind of like dropped off really

3633
03:01:47,140 --> 03:01:49,460
fast and I think most of those people went over to Dead by

3634
03:01:49,460 --> 03:01:51,860
Daylight, but I enjoyed the Friday the 13th game. So, if

3635
03:01:51,860 --> 03:01:54,420
she's never played it, I would think that's one. But you know

3636
03:01:54,420 --> 03:01:59,220
what? I'm gonna say go for the gate because these are the ones

3637
03:01:59,220 --> 03:02:01,700
I'm more into instead of like the jump scares and things like

3638
03:02:01,700 --> 03:02:04,100
that. Go into the things that are really like the

3639
03:02:04,100 --> 03:02:07,780
psychological horrors. Is Silent Hill available on Steam?

3640
03:02:07,780 --> 03:02:10,100
Because that's gonna be serious. I'm always gonna. I don't think

3641
03:02:10,100 --> 03:02:14,260
so. I mean, if they are on Steam, I sure as hell haven't

3642
03:02:14,260 --> 03:02:17,940
seen them. Hmm. Well, look for it and see if it's there because

3643
03:02:17,940 --> 03:02:21,460
that would be an absolute recommend for me and then what

3644
03:02:21,460 --> 03:02:23,540
was I also gonna say as far as like the story. Silent Hill

3645
03:02:23,540 --> 03:02:27,780
Homecoming is. It's not the best but it's not. You could do

3646
03:02:27,780 --> 03:02:32,260
a lot worse. We just talked about Alan Wake earlier. Is

3647
03:02:32,260 --> 03:02:34,660
Alan Wake still available on Steam or is it? I think that was

3648
03:02:34,660 --> 03:02:39,780
still. The original game? No. American Nightmare? Yes. Oh,

3649
03:02:39,780 --> 03:02:41,780
that's weird. The original game is not. That's the one I would

3650
03:02:41,780 --> 03:02:45,380
have recommended because that's more the psychological thing I

3651
03:02:45,380 --> 03:02:48,020
would have said. Okay, so. Yeah, I think I think it has to

3652
03:02:48,020 --> 03:02:52,340
do with music licensing but I could be wrong. Okay. So, the

3653
03:02:52,340 --> 03:02:56,260
chat room always helping me out when I cannot help. Uh Pooba

3654
03:02:56,260 --> 03:03:00,180
has a bunch of answers here. Amnesia. Oh, **** I forgot about

3655
03:03:00,180 --> 03:03:03,460
the amnesia. She hasn't played Amnesia. Like, get the first

3656
03:03:03,460 --> 03:03:05,780
one. I mean, the later ones aren't bad but the the first

3657
03:03:05,780 --> 03:03:10,900
Amnesia game, holy **** That is that is one to do. Uh Pooba

3658
03:03:10,900 --> 03:03:13,220
also says until dawn. That's a PlayStation game though. That's

3659
03:03:13,220 --> 03:03:17,300
not on Steam. Trying to kind of filter this list for Steam.

3660
03:03:17,300 --> 03:03:19,300
Evil Within, was that a PC release or is that only

3661
03:03:19,300 --> 03:03:22,420
PlayStation? No, that would've been PC as well. Maybe Evil

3662
03:03:22,420 --> 03:03:24,500
Within. I've heard a lot of good things about that as well.

3663
03:03:24,500 --> 03:03:27,140
My son would recommend Bendy and the Ink Machine. That's

3664
03:03:27,140 --> 03:03:31,140
free. The first episode is free. Uh Alien Isolation. I

3665
03:03:31,140 --> 03:03:33,220
think that's a really good recommendation as well and I

3666
03:03:33,220 --> 03:03:36,020
know that's on Steam and I know a lot of people are really into

3667
03:03:36,020 --> 03:03:38,420
that. It's a different type of horror because the alien games

3668
03:03:38,420 --> 03:03:43,060
but I hear it is it's **** scary. Oh, alright. Alright,

3669
03:03:43,060 --> 03:03:46,980
well, definitely keeping all that in mind. Uh you know, in

3670
03:03:46,980 --> 03:03:49,540
you know, in fact, I know it's a couple of months off. I'm

3671
03:03:49,540 --> 03:03:52,820
trying to get a couple of ideas for her for Christmas present.

3672
03:03:52,820 --> 03:03:56,180
So, you know, I'll definitely mark those down. Uh you know,

3673
03:03:56,180 --> 03:03:59,540
on the relay note, you know, there I can't say for sure but

3674
03:03:59,540 --> 03:04:04,180
there's a chance that you may have run into her while at

3675
03:04:04,180 --> 03:04:07,140
Dragon Con. You know, I know there's there was like 80

3676
03:04:07,140 --> 03:04:10,100
something like 80 thousand people there. Yeah. So, trying

3677
03:04:10,100 --> 03:04:13,380
to find trying to find one person that is like trying to

3678
03:04:13,380 --> 03:04:17,460
find uh you know a hand stick but do you remember seeing

3679
03:04:17,460 --> 03:04:24,740
anyone in uh uh a Bioshock 2 Big Sister cosplay at all? Um

3680
03:04:24,740 --> 03:04:29,780
not this year. I've seen that in years past. Yeah. What about

3681
03:04:29,780 --> 03:04:34,740
um like a variation of uh the Powerpuff Girls uh you know

3682
03:04:34,740 --> 03:04:38,820
cosplay. I do remember seeing Powerpuff Girls but I'm not

3683
03:04:38,820 --> 03:04:42,100
gonna guarantee it was the same thing that uh yeah you know

3684
03:04:42,100 --> 03:04:44,500
again you you're kinda right. There's 80 thousand people.

3685
03:04:44,500 --> 03:04:46,980
Honestly, I think the best chance that I would have run

3686
03:04:46,980 --> 03:04:49,780
into her if she was at that if she's a horror game fan, she

3687
03:04:49,780 --> 03:04:53,380
might have been to that Five Nights at Freddy panel. Uh well

3688
03:04:53,380 --> 03:04:58,340
uh I don't think she was uh went to any panels at least not

3689
03:04:58,340 --> 03:05:01,540
that she mentioned. Uh she you know was more or less mingling

3690
03:05:01,540 --> 03:05:04,660
around going to various parties and whatnot. It's fine.

3691
03:05:04,660 --> 03:05:07,220
It's what a lot of people do. Unfortunately, I couldn't go

3692
03:05:07,220 --> 03:05:11,780
with her, you know, cuz kevlar expenses but. Sure. But you

3693
03:05:11,780 --> 03:05:14,660
know, she told me all about and you know, she told me she had a

3694
03:05:14,660 --> 03:05:18,020
blast so but uh anyway, I'll let you go. I've been rambling

3695
03:05:18,020 --> 03:05:20,660
on too long and I'm sure you wanna take some more no more

3696
03:05:20,660 --> 03:05:23,700
calls but I'll uh speak to you soon, right? No worries. Take

3697
03:05:23,700 --> 03:05:29,940
care and uh we'll see you soon. Yup. You too. Yup. Bye. I

3698
03:05:29,940 --> 03:05:31,780
don't know if I would have found one particular person at

3699
03:05:31,780 --> 03:05:35,780
Dragon Con. There's a lot of cosplays to be honest. A lot of

3700
03:05:35,780 --> 03:05:39,700
excellent cosplay and I've seen the full on uh not the now that

3701
03:05:39,700 --> 03:05:41,700
he's now that I'm thinking about it. I wasn't I'm getting

3702
03:05:41,700 --> 03:05:45,140
my Bioshock terms mixed up cuz I saw the I saw the big

3703
03:05:45,140 --> 03:05:49,460
daddies like the full on like mech **** I saw that like a

3704
03:05:49,460 --> 03:05:52,260
couple years ago and that was like I remember thinking like

3705
03:05:52,260 --> 03:05:55,780
that was some impressive **** cosplay like you know but they

3706
03:05:55,780 --> 03:05:57,700
have said Dragon Con has been called the Super Bowl of

3707
03:05:57,700 --> 03:06:00,580
cosplay and it does that for a reason because there's some

3708
03:06:00,580 --> 03:06:04,740
really impressive stuff there but in all honesty, this year,

3709
03:06:04,740 --> 03:06:07,860
I tried to stay away from a lot of that because they all hang

3710
03:06:07,860 --> 03:06:14,420
out at the Marriott and it's so crowded in there and like I

3711
03:06:14,420 --> 03:06:18,340
can do crowds to a point but like it doesn't happen to me a

3712
03:06:18,340 --> 03:06:21,540
lot but I had a claustrophobia moment at Dragon Con this year.

3713
03:06:21,540 --> 03:06:24,660
That has not happened to me since the very first Gamer X

3714
03:06:24,660 --> 03:06:27,780
that was in the basement of this very small hotel and like

3715
03:06:27,780 --> 03:06:29,700
all these panels were letting out at the same time. It got

3716
03:06:29,700 --> 03:06:32,580
too crowded down there and my brain just went, what if this

3717
03:06:32,580 --> 03:06:35,540
place caught on fire right now and I like started freaking out

3718
03:06:35,540 --> 03:06:38,100
so I had a moment like that at Dragon Con this year and so

3719
03:06:38,100 --> 03:06:39,940
that's why I just kinda try to stay away from a lot of the

3720
03:06:39,940 --> 03:06:44,020
crowded areas but I mean I did I not to say I like completely

3721
03:06:44,020 --> 03:06:48,180
avoided him cuz I remember Travis Donovan and uh his wife

3722
03:06:48,180 --> 03:06:50,740
really like to hang out at Polt's Bar which is like the

3723
03:06:50,740 --> 03:06:53,940
central for all that stuff. So I did have to wade into it a

3724
03:06:53,940 --> 03:06:57,780
couple times. So, um I did I did see some of that which

3725
03:06:57,780 --> 03:06:59,860
shout out to Travis by the way. It was really good to see him

3726
03:06:59,860 --> 03:07:04,980
this year as well as uh even more so his wife. Alright, uh

3727
03:07:04,980 --> 03:07:07,780
one last call for calls here at Orange Lounge Radio. All one

3728
03:07:07,780 --> 03:07:09,940
word on Skype but if we don't get anything then I think we'll

3729
03:07:09,940 --> 03:07:11,780
wrap things up but anything else you wanted to do uh

3730
03:07:11,780 --> 03:07:14,580
mention Loki? No. Can we get out of here for the night? Uh

3731
03:07:14,580 --> 03:07:17,460
it's been it's been a long time since we've done a show. So,

3732
03:07:17,460 --> 03:07:20,180
I'm. Yes. Really glad we were back tonight. So, alright.

3733
03:07:20,500 --> 03:07:25,860
Well, let me oh uh Rage Nator just posted a picture. So, I'm

3734
03:07:25,860 --> 03:07:28,740
gonna take a look right now at that picture. I mean, I'm

3735
03:07:28,740 --> 03:07:30,900
probably not going to remember it but let's see. You never

3736
03:07:30,900 --> 03:07:34,420
know. Oh, that's a really good cosplay for what it's worth.

3737
03:07:34,420 --> 03:07:40,900
Damn. Is that your friend? Okay. So, like uh again, it's a

3738
03:07:40,900 --> 03:07:43,380
radio show. So, I'm having a hard time. It's it's a they

3739
03:07:43,380 --> 03:07:45,620
took the picture in front of the oh they must have done this

3740
03:07:45,620 --> 03:07:48,580
at the Georgia Aquarium on Thursday cuz they actually so

3741
03:07:48,580 --> 03:07:50,900
they actually have a picture in front of all these fish to

3742
03:07:50,900 --> 03:07:52,820
make it look like it's underwater and it's it's uh

3743
03:07:52,820 --> 03:07:55,540
it's really well done. So, I mean, props on the cosplay.

3744
03:07:55,540 --> 03:07:57,460
That's. Scared all the kids at the aquarium. Yeah, scare

3745
03:07:57,460 --> 03:08:00,260
everybody there. That's uh pretty good. Alright. Well, no

3746
03:08:00,260 --> 03:08:02,260
other calls are coming in. So, I think we're gonna close up

3747
03:08:02,260 --> 03:08:04,020
the Skype line but I will say if you didn't get through

3748
03:08:04,020 --> 03:08:06,500
tonight but you do wanna say something, you can get to us on

3749
03:08:06,500 --> 03:08:09,460
Discord. You can uh send us a Twitter message or any of that

3750
03:08:09,460 --> 03:08:12,820
stuff. All of that would work very well and um yeah,

3751
03:08:12,820 --> 03:08:15,460
participate at Orange Andrade.com to send us an email.

3752
03:08:15,460 --> 03:08:20,260
So, um anyway, I did wanna say uh a big thanks uh to everybody

3753
03:08:20,260 --> 03:08:22,500
for being here especially after we've been off for a couple

3754
03:08:22,500 --> 03:08:24,900
weeks. I know it can throw off your rhythm. So, thank you so

3755
03:08:24,900 --> 03:08:27,140
much for uh finding us again or maybe you found us for the

3756
03:08:27,140 --> 03:08:29,300
first time. Uh thanks for being with us here on Orange

3757
03:08:29,300 --> 03:08:32,500
Andradeo. Uh we don't uh ask for money uh here at Orange

3758
03:08:32,500 --> 03:08:35,140
Andradeo. All we ask is that you spread the word. Help

3759
03:08:35,140 --> 03:08:38,020
tell a friend or two or five about the show. Help us spread

3760
03:08:38,020 --> 03:08:39,940
the word because we are the show where every gamer has a

3761
03:08:39,940 --> 03:08:43,300
voice but only if the voices are here to air their

3762
03:08:43,300 --> 03:08:47,140
grievances uh as YY did earlier in the program. Uh so

3763
03:08:47,140 --> 03:08:51,380
anyway, um a nice five-star review on iTunes or Google Play

3764
03:08:51,380 --> 03:08:54,100
wherever you found this show. Uh the that all goes a very

3765
03:08:54,100 --> 03:08:57,220
long way as well. We really appreciate all that. So, I think

3766
03:08:57,220 --> 03:08:59,940
on that note, we're gonna wrap things up. Uh Loki, your final

3767
03:08:59,940 --> 03:09:04,260
thought. My final thought is go play old school musical. It's

3768
03:09:04,260 --> 03:09:08,340
pretty fun. My final thought is I will. There you go. Alright,

3769
03:09:08,340 --> 03:09:11,460
done deal. My final thought is I hope my internet gets fixed

3770
03:09:11,460 --> 03:09:14,420
cuz I miss streaming on Twitch but at least I'm starting to

3771
03:09:14,420 --> 03:09:16,740
get creative and think of workarounds but it's gonna be

3772
03:09:16,740 --> 03:09:18,900
very hard to move this show to Twitch if we can't stream on

3773
03:09:18,900 --> 03:09:21,780
Twitch but I guess we could always just do a low bit rate.

3774
03:09:21,780 --> 03:09:26,340
I didn't say the video would have to be HD quality. Alright.

3775
03:09:26,340 --> 03:09:29,300
Uh but that's really it. We're done for the night and we'll

3776
03:09:29,300 --> 03:09:31,140
see you next time here on Orange Andradeo. Thanks for

3777
03:09:31,140 --> 03:09:35,460
being here. Till next time. Like seriously, just don't be an

3778
03:09:35,460 --> 03:09:38,740
**** gamer. It's not hard. Don't be an ****. Just get out

3779
03:09:38,740 --> 03:09:41,620
of bed today and say, I'm not gonna be an **** and then

3780
03:09:41,620 --> 03:09:45,460
