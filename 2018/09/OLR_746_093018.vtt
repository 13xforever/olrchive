This week, Pokemon Go became canon by officially debuting a brand new Pokemon, though we still

00:18.000 --> 00:22.120
have to wait for information beyond its looks. This is one new item amongst a sea of classics,

00:22.120 --> 00:25.600
join us for a healthy mix of both in the week's news starting right now on the show, where

00:25.600 --> 00:33.680
every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio. Hello my friends out there on the internet,

00:33.680 --> 00:37.640
welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge

00:37.640 --> 00:44.160
Radio, live tonight on September the 30th of 2018 with episode number 746 of our show.

00:44.160 --> 00:49.600
I am Rob Roberts and joining me here in studio is Loki. How are you, Loki? Hello, I'm fine.

00:49.600 --> 00:55.320
Yeah, fun week? Good week? No, I'm alright. Gaming? Do any DDR? We've had a lot of talk

00:55.320 --> 01:00.360
about DDR's 20th anniversary this past week. We'll get into it, we have a news item later

01:00.360 --> 01:05.160
about how Konami is acknowledging that, but have you done anything special to acknowledge 20 years

01:05.160 --> 01:09.800
of DDR, Loki? I played a lot of DDR, that's about it. That's the way to do it. You know what's funny

01:09.800 --> 01:14.080
is that out of the blue I got a message from a Facebook friend asking me questions about DDR

01:14.080 --> 01:19.840
because they were like, you know, what was the good PlayStation mix because we want to set up

01:19.840 --> 01:24.120
a dance pad and do all this thing and I'm like, dang, what a throwback because I'm thinking about

01:24.120 --> 01:28.840
it's kind of sad you can't really play DDR anymore on PlayStation 3 or 4 like Konami just didn't

01:28.840 --> 01:32.560
really push the series. Looking for your music game peripherals? You can find them used everywhere.

01:32.560 --> 01:37.560
I know, I know. They were asking about like what type of pad should they get? They already were

01:37.560 --> 01:41.520
kind of leaning towards the foam. You remember when Red Octane back in the day had those foamy

01:41.520 --> 01:45.240
and I always thought those were probably the best ones. Step Maniacs. And the big zipper pouch.

01:45.240 --> 01:50.280
The Step Maniacs pads. The ones that are like a thousand dollars. Oh, the metal? Oh, the actual

01:50.280 --> 01:55.640
game. They actually sell the pads. No, I know. I know. I think they've been, those things have

01:55.640 --> 02:00.240
been selling out as fast as they can make them. I see some of the stuff on Kyle Ward's Facebook,

02:00.240 --> 02:03.360
like they just can't keep that stuff. I'm just glad I don't have to worry about that crap anymore

02:03.360 --> 02:08.240
when I was like, oh, I'm going to build the better pads so they can actually play arcade DDR.

02:08.240 --> 02:13.080
There you go. Uh, go into our chat over at live.vog network.com because we do date live

02:13.080 --> 02:17.880
every Sunday night at the voice geeks network of vog network.com six o'clock Pacific nine

02:17.880 --> 02:21.560
o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby black Wolf show. Orange right says, check your local

02:21.560 --> 02:27.360
thrift stores. Oh yeah, we go to Goodwill every Saturday and um, they have all sorts of DJ hero

02:27.360 --> 02:31.360
stuff and it's funny cause they don't really know how it's supposed to go together. So they have

02:31.360 --> 02:36.880
like two turntables in the mixer in the middle. They're like, yeah, that's about right. Looks,

02:36.880 --> 02:44.320
we don't know what this is, but it's $5 nailed it. All right. Uh, uh, dark Sakura, uh, not here

02:44.320 --> 02:48.480
tonight. She is a on her work commitment for a little while longer, but she'll be joining us

02:48.480 --> 02:52.880
a little later in the show for the classic game of the week. Um, so we'll talk a little more about

02:52.880 --> 02:58.200
DDR and music stuff later, but let's get into the kickoff topic for tonight, which is a pretty big

02:58.200 --> 03:02.880
update, something we've been waiting for. We wondered if the internet would really be able

03:02.880 --> 03:10.920
to have some power over Sony and it looks like Sony has caved a little bit on, on what people

03:10.960 --> 03:18.120
been asking about. Right. Logie. Yeah, they caved. Um, they're basically now allowing cross-play for

03:18.120 --> 03:24.520
Fortnite. So, you know, following a comprehensive evaluation process, SIE has identified a path

03:24.520 --> 03:30.080
towards support for cross-platform features for on select third party content. We recognize that

03:30.080 --> 03:35.880
PlayStation four players have been eerily awaiting an update and we appreciate the community's

03:35.880 --> 03:40.200
continued patience as we have navigated through the issue of the finest solution. Bullshit. You

03:40.200 --> 03:47.920
just had a fucking backlash against your shit and that's why I like how you just just cut off the

03:47.920 --> 03:53.360
official statement. Now, now this is lies. This is lies. The official statement is just like, we're

03:53.360 --> 03:57.120
really, of course, you know, the vice president, they said, when you know, we're really happy for

03:57.120 --> 04:00.680
the PlayStation Fortnite communities and this is a great step and we know that rocket league players

04:00.680 --> 04:05.280
and their own communities wants to know what this means for them, but we don't have any updates at

04:05.280 --> 04:10.680
the moment. In other words, the biggest game where the people are the loudest needed to get it the

04:10.680 --> 04:15.640
first and in some ways, which was the most fucked up implementation because of the whole locked

04:15.640 --> 04:20.720
account where like you couldn't even play it on the switch if you had a PlayStation four and all

04:20.720 --> 04:26.480
that stuff. And they are releasing a process to unlink your account from the PlayStation four and

04:26.480 --> 04:31.760
be able to play on all of them. Yay. So that's going to be happening soon. Well, that's great.

04:32.280 --> 04:36.440
I wish I had time there that came to their senses. Yeah, I know. I wish I played more Fortnite to be

04:36.440 --> 04:41.520
able to really appreciate this news, but, uh, I don't play a lot of it, but I know tons of people

04:41.520 --> 04:48.560
do. So this is certainly a good start. But, um, let me ask about this. Like, is this, I mean,

04:48.560 --> 04:53.120
cause this is still, it's almost kind of like a weird way of thinking now because this opens

04:53.120 --> 04:56.880
Pandora's box. I'm not mistaken. They're not saying this is going to be limited to Fortnite.

04:56.880 --> 05:00.920
They didn't come out and say only Fortnite is going to get an exception. They're basically

05:00.960 --> 05:04.160
saying this is something we're going to be looking at in the future. So, you know,

05:04.160 --> 05:07.440
like rocket league, like you mentioned, even though there might not be plans right this

05:07.440 --> 05:11.160
second, I'm sure it's something they're, you know, going to be looking at in the next few months.

05:11.160 --> 05:17.000
Um, what else? I'm Minecraft has gotta be something. Minecraft's weird cause it's a Microsoft game,

05:17.000 --> 05:21.560
but I would think though that they should like plain. Well, yeah, and that's going to be a big

05:21.560 --> 05:26.680
like news, but still Nintendo played nice with them. And come on, Nintendo is so backwards when

05:26.680 --> 05:31.640
it comes to networking stuff that like if they're doing it, you probably should be doing it. Yeah,

05:31.640 --> 05:36.200
I get it. You're, you're scared because you, you want to, you know, stop any sort of ways for

05:36.200 --> 05:41.080
people to hack your platform. It doesn't matter what you do. They're going to find a way. And if

05:41.080 --> 05:45.640
you do this kind of crap where you block stuff off and you like cripple different, you're just giving

05:45.640 --> 05:51.720
them incentive to do exactly. Yeah. So it, you know, take it from Nintendo. I mean, they know

05:51.720 --> 05:55.640
better. They, even though they have the cross platform stuff, I mean that hasn't stopped their

05:55.640 --> 06:02.280
platform from getting hacked and you know, getting their characters turned into sex memes and shit

06:02.280 --> 06:06.920
like that. What do you think will be the next game to, uh, and I asked this of our chat room as well.

06:06.920 --> 06:10.840
What do you think will be the next game to cross over? You think rocket league is kind of obvious

06:10.840 --> 06:15.640
one? It's a switch. It literally is just like a switch to flip on for them. Um, I would say

06:15.640 --> 06:21.240
Overwatch, um, not PC so much because blizzard has made the decision. They don't want keyboard

06:21.240 --> 06:25.080
and mouse mixed with controller, which is going to be weird though, because yeah, I know it's coming

06:25.080 --> 06:29.320
up later. We'll talk about that. We'll get into that then. Um, but, um, as far as like PlayStation

06:29.320 --> 06:33.240
four and Xbox one, there shouldn't really be anything, um, separate news consoles anymore.

06:33.240 --> 06:37.880
And another reason why I target Overwatch is, well, I mean, it's a big deal. Overwatch is

06:37.880 --> 06:43.880
everywhere and Blizzcon is coming up. This would be a great thing. I mean, surely if I were blizzard,

06:43.880 --> 06:47.800
I would be pushing to make this an announcement. We're going to make it. Blizzcon is that

06:47.800 --> 06:54.280
Overwatch will soon be playable on PlayStation four and Xbox one cross platform, especially,

06:54.280 --> 06:58.360
especially if they're working on a switch version after all, which I kind of, I actually don't think

06:58.360 --> 07:02.200
they are, but I mean, I would love to be wrong on that. I would love, love, love to be wrong on that

07:02.200 --> 07:07.400
and have a switch version of Overwatch. Um, and that would be fantastic if it was completely

07:07.400 --> 07:11.400
playable across all those platforms. Although there is a part of me that thinks PC should be

07:11.400 --> 07:16.840
involved in that as well. And blizzard might need to think about, um, just having keyboard and mouse

07:16.840 --> 07:22.120
designation versus, you know, uh, controller designation, but I'm sure I think they'd be

07:22.120 --> 07:25.160
worried people would try to hack that. Do you remember back in this, funny enough, we were talking

07:25.160 --> 07:31.800
about DDR, right? Do you remember in DDR ultra mix, when you would play online, you could see

07:31.800 --> 07:37.800
if the person was using a dance pad or a controller. But the thing was, is that it had to be an

07:37.800 --> 07:42.600
officially licensed dance pad for it to show up as dance pad, or it would show up as a controller

07:42.600 --> 07:46.840
because I think the USB was probably sending some sort of special signal to the Xbox. I have an ID.

07:46.840 --> 07:51.400
Yeah. I don't know how it all worked, but I just remember that. So it's like, they could probably

07:51.400 --> 07:55.880
do that with like a keyboard mouse signature versus a, uh, I already have peripherals that

07:55.880 --> 07:59.480
could do keyboard and mouse if they really want to. That's true. That's true. So I don't know,

07:59.480 --> 08:04.200
maybe blizzard needs to, I think about that a little bit, uh, going to chat at live.vognetwork.com.

08:04.200 --> 08:09.800
Uh, Brad from Pod Culture agrees, bring Overwatch to Switch. Uh, Dortitsuya says, I agree with Loki

08:09.800 --> 08:15.560
though, either Rocket League or Minecraft. Um, let's see, Kaijuto in chat says, I bet the crossplay

08:15.560 --> 08:20.680
gets underused too if there's some type of option for crossplay. You know, let's talk about that

08:20.760 --> 08:26.120
comment for a minute actually. Is, is after all the bitching and moaning and whining,

08:26.120 --> 08:31.240
which I really think the catalyst for this was the locking of the Fortnite accounts.

08:31.960 --> 08:37.160
I don't think you would have seen the big backlash that you did if people had been able to log in and

08:37.160 --> 08:41.160
make their Switch account, no problem. I think if Sony wants to pinpoint, where did we fuck up?

08:41.800 --> 08:46.200
That did you in? Uh, cause I honestly think if that hadn't been a factor and you could still

08:46.200 --> 08:50.040
make an account wherever, people would have just accepted the fact that, eh, whatever,

08:50.120 --> 08:56.040
you can only play on whatever platform. Because of this, you know, the previous thing where they

08:56.040 --> 08:59.880
locked shit out and because of the statements like, well, we're just the best platform. So

08:59.880 --> 09:04.040
that's why we just don't want to play nice. Their follow-up statements weren't exactly graceful.

09:04.600 --> 09:09.560
And also their support for mods on the platform versus what the support is on the Microsoft

09:09.560 --> 09:13.160
platform. I'm just like, if it comes across platform stuff, if I'm going to purchase a

09:13.160 --> 09:15.880
game on one of those two platforms, I'm not going to purchase it on Sony's platform.

09:16.680 --> 09:21.720
Granted, I don't have a Microsoft console by PC, so I just will play it on PC. But might it

09:21.720 --> 09:27.080
influence your decision when we're talking PlayStation five and Xbox max? Absolutely.

09:27.080 --> 09:33.000
It will. Yeah. So this will be very interesting where when we start announcing those consoles,

09:33.000 --> 09:37.320
which could be as soon as next year, probably more, I don't know, actually,

09:37.320 --> 09:41.560
do you think Microsoft's going to plunk down Xbox next? That's what I'm going to call it for now.

09:41.560 --> 09:45.560
Cause obviously we don't know what the name will be. Do you think, um, Microsoft's going to plunk

09:45.560 --> 09:49.720
down Xbox next next year? Cause they've already, they've already done the little, little, little

09:49.720 --> 09:55.560
tittle teas. Probably I'd say maybe a couple more years. I think 2020, I would have guessed 2020 for

09:55.560 --> 09:59.800
both, but I don't know. Then Microsoft kind of did a little, maybe they want to be first out the gate

09:59.800 --> 10:06.040
like they were with three 60. Who knows? Yeah. I don't know. Uh, Brad, the stuff that they have

10:06.040 --> 10:11.880
right now, they could change. It's just policy that they don't agree with. Well, going back to

10:11.880 --> 10:16.600
guys, you just comment about cross play getting underused. I mean, it's kind of a good call out.

10:16.600 --> 10:21.320
How many people are really going to be using this cross play thing? Maybe it's different in a game

10:21.320 --> 10:26.040
like Fortnite where they're trying to load up a hundred players or whatever. But I mean, I don't

10:26.040 --> 10:30.920
know, like I haven't really sat there and thought about like, who do I want to invite on Xbox when

10:30.920 --> 10:36.360
I'm playing on my PlayStation? I mean, if this rule is really changing, it almost kind of makes

10:36.360 --> 10:44.920
me have to think about the way that I approach this online gaming. Because to be fair, even if

10:44.920 --> 10:50.680
cross play is going to be a deal, there are still some things that are locked away. For example,

10:50.680 --> 10:58.200
party chat, right? Now, if the party chat is in the Fortnite game, then I imagine that'll work

10:58.200 --> 11:02.760
cross platform. I haven't really heard about voice chat, but I'm thinking more of the fact that like,

11:03.080 --> 11:09.000
on PlayStation, you can have like a localized party on PlayStation, right? And then I believe

11:09.000 --> 11:12.120
it's the same type of deal on Microsoft's platform, right? So if I'm kind of working

11:12.120 --> 11:15.560
with my own little party here, I wouldn't necessarily be able to talk to the people

11:15.560 --> 11:21.880
on the Microsoft side. So there are some things that are still kind of locked if I'm not mistaken,

11:21.880 --> 11:30.120
right? So you still would have the best experience if you're all on one ecosystem, am I right?

11:31.080 --> 11:31.880
I suppose.

11:34.760 --> 11:38.600
See, we haven't even we haven't even bothered to think about this, which is just hooray.

11:40.920 --> 11:44.920
I think that's all done in because that's why they have voice chat with, you know,

11:48.120 --> 11:52.920
Fortnite right now in the Switch version is because it's in the actual app and not the,

11:53.960 --> 11:57.160
you know, it's not linked to the console or anything.

11:57.160 --> 12:01.000
Okay, let me go to chat at live.vognetware.com. Bobby Blackwell says, it's more about playing

12:01.000 --> 12:05.800
with friends that may have other consoles. For instance, I wouldn't know where to buy Overwatch.

12:05.800 --> 12:09.720
I have people to play Overwatch on PC. I have people to play on PS4. I have people to play on

12:09.720 --> 12:14.280
Xbox One. If I could buy one Overwatch and play it with all my friends, that would make me more

12:14.280 --> 12:19.480
likely to play Overwatch. I'm lucky enough to have all the consoles and I have all the consoles as

12:19.480 --> 12:24.760
well. But I mean, the kind of the point I'm trying to make there is that it may not quite be that

12:24.760 --> 12:33.640
easy. If the chat is on Battle.net's side, which I think it is, it would for PC, it has to be.

12:33.640 --> 12:39.560
So the chat is on Battle.net side for PC. But what if you want to chat with the people on

12:39.560 --> 12:43.320
PlayStation and you get in one of those, are you going to be able to voice chat with them

12:43.320 --> 12:47.080
if the voice chat isn't supported through Battle.net on consoles? Does that make sense

12:47.080 --> 12:52.040
what I'm saying? Yes. Then you're not, you're playing with them, but you're not really able

12:52.040 --> 12:56.040
to interact with them and you might still kind of be back at the square one problem.

12:56.040 --> 13:00.440
So this is going to put an onus, if I'm not mistaken, on the third parties to have their

13:00.440 --> 13:05.640
own server structures so that people can use voice chat. Or you just need to get Discord apps on all

13:05.640 --> 13:10.680
consoles then. Oh, you think that could be a thing? Discord on consoles? Do you think Sony or

13:10.680 --> 13:15.080
Microsoft is interested on Discord? Actually, didn't Microsoft have a partnership with Discord of some

13:15.080 --> 13:21.320
sort? I don't think Discord's on Xbox, but I remember Microsoft wanted to cuddle up with them.

13:21.320 --> 13:26.920
That's true. That's true. Let's see. Yeah, Microsoft has a partnership with Discord.

13:26.920 --> 13:31.080
I thought that was a thing, but they have a partnership, but that doesn't mean a Discord

13:31.080 --> 13:38.360
app on Xbox One yet. Maybe that's something where it's going. Anyway. Oh yeah, they show the game

13:38.360 --> 13:42.920
you're playing on Discord. That was what it was. If you connect your Xbox Live and you're playing

13:42.920 --> 13:47.640
something on Xbox, it will show on Discord. Kind of like Spotify will show what you're listening

13:47.640 --> 13:53.800
to. That whole type of thing. Yeah. Yeah. So interesting. Let's see. Dr. Tzuyu says,

13:53.800 --> 13:58.040
maybe that's why Nintendo didn't do any of that stuff for online. If they're open to cross-play,

13:58.040 --> 14:01.960
that would have, they would have had to worry about all that stuff. So I guess they decided

14:01.960 --> 14:06.440
to just make it simple. Yeah. I don't know. I think we're still going to find some things out

14:06.440 --> 14:12.120
as time goes on, but I do firmly believe that we would never have been at this point

14:12.120 --> 14:16.200
if Fortnite accounts hadn't been locked, if you'd used it on PlayStation 4. I think that

14:16.200 --> 14:23.560
was the thing that made this whole thing fall apart. Yeah. I don't think, I don't think the,

14:23.560 --> 14:27.320
the call would have been this loud. I don't think everybody would have been as crazy, but that,

14:27.320 --> 14:32.120
that was the thing that, that did him in, especially when Sony knows that for the longest

14:32.120 --> 14:37.640
time, Nintendo has been competing to be the other console in everybody's house. Right. We've known

14:37.640 --> 14:40.840
that for some time. Nintendo has always been competing to be the other console in somebody's

14:40.840 --> 14:46.680
house. It's never really competed on that same level in some regards as PlayStation 4 and Xbox

14:46.680 --> 14:50.920
One. Although there are plenty of households where the Switch is the only co or Wii U,

14:50.920 --> 14:57.800
Wii whatever, is the only console to be found. So, interesting. VidPower in chat says,

14:57.800 --> 15:03.080
it'd be interesting if Microsoft chooses Discord over Skype, which they own. It would be

15:03.080 --> 15:10.200
interesting because Microsoft does own Skype, but you don't really think about Skype for gaming very

15:10.200 --> 15:16.520
often. Skype is how you call your family with, in another country with free long distance,

15:16.520 --> 15:21.480
I think is, or, or free internet, you know, VoIP or whatever. Uh, I think that's what a lot of

15:21.480 --> 15:26.280
people are associating Skype with. I don't know. A lot of the online games I've played that are like

15:26.280 --> 15:30.120
the, the reality stuff I've talked about before on the show, like Survivor and Big Brother,

15:30.120 --> 15:34.440
they all play on Skype because Skype is you, everybody fucking has Skype because it's on

15:34.440 --> 15:40.360
every Windows computer. I guess, I guess, but Skype, I mean, everybody has it. Like,

15:40.360 --> 15:45.160
it's very easy to get on a mobile app. It's on the fricking PC. It's preloaded with Windows.

15:45.160 --> 15:49.640
I know, right? So it's like everybody, even if you have a Mac, like it's very easy to get Skype.

15:49.640 --> 15:56.840
It's just an app on, you know, the, the OS store. So Skype, I feel like a lot of people use Skype,

15:56.840 --> 16:01.240
but that's just my perception. And that's, that's not even talking about here at OLR,

16:01.240 --> 16:04.200
which by the way, on that note, before we get into our gaming weeks,

16:05.160 --> 16:10.840
did you know that Skype will finally stop working on this potato XP computer as of November 1st?

16:11.640 --> 16:18.040
Well, I know, right? So they said that they're not gonna support the old Skype 7 or whatever,

16:18.040 --> 16:22.360
and it's gonna force you to go to the newest Skype, which of course doesn't work on XP,

16:22.360 --> 16:28.200
which I know you all give me shit about the fact that I'm still running XP for this show, but A,

16:28.840 --> 16:32.600
money doesn't fucking grow on trees. So I haven't exactly bought, you know, the upgrade computer,

16:32.600 --> 16:36.920
but to be fair, it is in the path because obviously we're going to be talking about

16:36.920 --> 16:41.160
Twitch streaming. I can't Twitch stream on this current computer. So it was always part of that

16:41.160 --> 16:45.560
path was to, yes, finally get off of this potato computer that we've been using for so long, um,

16:45.560 --> 16:49.720
to do the video streaming and all that. But it's just, it's just irritating to have that arbitrary

16:49.720 --> 16:53.800
deadline put in because they don't want to support the old Skype anymore. You know,

16:53.880 --> 16:58.120
DDR ace runs XP embedded, so it's fine. That's right. You know what? Your arcade

16:58.120 --> 17:05.880
games still use windows XP, so get off my ass. I guess we could always use the tablet

17:05.880 --> 17:09.560
kind of like we used to use before. Um, I have thought about just straight up,

17:09.560 --> 17:14.440
maybe switching to discord at this point. Um, I don't know. I'd be curious about your guys's

17:14.440 --> 17:19.640
feedback, but you'd have to tweet us or use, use our, use our discord to tell me what you think.

17:19.640 --> 17:23.160
If maybe now is the time with this whole Skype thing changing,

17:23.160 --> 17:26.600
maybe it's just time. We just go to discord for calls. So tell me what you think.

17:27.240 --> 17:33.720
Anyway. Um, rage nator and chat suggests clearly you have the wrong fucking trees. Oh,

17:33.720 --> 17:36.680
well if you have some money seeds, please let me know. I would love to grow some of

17:36.680 --> 17:41.720
those in my backyard amongst everything else that's growing out there. Um, thank you,

17:41.720 --> 17:44.680
thank you, Brad from pod culture. I can get you a free copy of seven or eight if you want.

17:44.680 --> 17:49.320
I appreciate that. I actually have a serial number for 10. Thanks to a kind listener.

17:49.320 --> 17:54.040
I just, you know, have to have the machine that makes it work, which I have some parts.

17:54.040 --> 18:00.520
It's just, everything's a mess. So actually, I honestly, I kind of wanted to go to a laptop

18:00.520 --> 18:03.800
so that the show could be portable as well. So that's still something that's in the back

18:03.800 --> 18:07.160
of my mind, but I have to make all those decisions the next month or two.

18:07.720 --> 18:11.880
But, uh, yeah, like I said, money doesn't grow on trees. I'm not going to ask the listeners

18:11.880 --> 18:17.000
for money. I don't want to do that. Um, I will, uh, you know, I have money set aside. It's just,

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
you know, working that all out. Anyway, enough about that behind the scenes stuff.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.160
Let's get into the types of games that we have been playing this week in how was your

18:25.160 --> 18:28.840
gaming week. So Loki, what types of video games you've been playing this week?

18:28.840 --> 18:33.640
Mainly Pokemon go, um, because I've been doing a lot of walking, so I've been playing that.

18:34.520 --> 18:40.280
Um, aside from that, actually, I forgot to mention the last week I played, um,

18:40.280 --> 18:45.480
old school musical, which is fantastic. It's a rhythm music game. That's got a

18:45.560 --> 18:49.000
lot of homages to old NES and super NES games.

18:51.080 --> 18:55.640
And then I also played lots of dances, revolution, extreme. That's pretty much it.

18:56.360 --> 19:02.520
I watched, um, I watched, uh, Bobby Black Wolf play some of that old school musical on his

19:02.520 --> 19:06.680
Twitch stream. It looked really fun. It looked kind of like guitar man, but like retro style.

19:06.680 --> 19:10.920
Yeah. Kind of cool. And then they have like this, I've already beaten the game and then they have

19:10.920 --> 19:16.040
this, um, like chicken crusader mode thing. The, you play a lot of the same songs again,

19:16.040 --> 19:18.680
but they add modifiers to them to make them harder to play.

19:19.800 --> 19:23.800
So I'm going through that right now. Okay. That's cool. Um, yeah, there's, there's,

19:23.800 --> 19:27.560
is that, is that the DLC or is the DLC like a whole separate thing? Cause Bobby's talking

19:27.560 --> 19:31.160
about, he hasn't played the DLC yet. Um, I don't remember that it's DLC or not.

19:32.200 --> 19:36.280
I did buy the DLC. I think the DLC adds more songs to that mode.

19:37.240 --> 19:42.200
Okay. I'll, uh, I'll have to, I will, it's on my list of things to check out, but you know,

19:42.200 --> 19:45.960
you know me, I'm always stuck with the online games. So let's talk about my gaming week and

19:45.960 --> 19:49.480
all the online games I've been playing. Cause I'm still trucking along in world of Warcraft.

19:49.480 --> 19:53.880
I hit max level, which is now believe it or not max level in world of Warcraft is 120.

19:53.880 --> 20:00.440
That's the highest level you can get to when wow first came out, 60 was the cap. So it grew 70,

20:00.520 --> 20:06.040
80, 85, 90, a hundred, 110, 120. That's where all the, that's how many expansions this game's had.

20:06.040 --> 20:09.400
That's a lot of expansion. I know. Right. But wow is kind of an old game at this point,

20:09.400 --> 20:13.320
if you think about it. But, um, yeah, I'm, I'm still enjoying the expansion. This is

20:13.320 --> 20:16.520
about the point where I'd usually burn out cause I'm not really interested in rating,

20:16.520 --> 20:21.160
but we'll see how it goes. Who knows? Um, so there's that. Uh, and then, um,

20:21.160 --> 20:25.080
I've still been playing Final Fantasy 14. I'm juggling two MMOs. It's crazy.

20:25.080 --> 20:30.280
But, uh, you know, I'll, I'll get a text message like, Hey, let's do an expert if I have SE 14.

20:30.280 --> 20:33.960
So I'll switch over, do the expert. And it's kind of like, I'm keeping my feet wet in that game.

20:33.960 --> 20:39.320
But right now, wow. Kind of feels like what's more new and exciting. Even though 14 had a patch,

20:40.280 --> 20:47.640
like, and I love 14, but I really hope their next expansion isn't as formulaic as these past couple

20:47.640 --> 20:52.520
expansions have been. And what I mean by that is that here comes the point one patch, which will

20:52.600 --> 20:58.040
have two new dungeons and an eight man raid. Here comes the point two patch, which will have two new

20:58.040 --> 21:03.800
dungeons or one new dungeon and a 24 man raid. Here comes that back to the eight man raid,

21:03.800 --> 21:08.840
back to the 24 man raid and a dungeon or two dungeon. It's like, it's very, very predictable.

21:08.840 --> 21:13.800
And there's not enough, like, I just want to like fuck around and do something different stuff,

21:13.800 --> 21:18.600
which wow, because it's been around so fucking long and he has all these expansions.

21:18.600 --> 21:24.120
Wow. Definitely feels like there's like so much like other like crap you can do in that game.

21:24.120 --> 21:27.800
Like if you want to get into like the pet battles and all that, that whole Pandora's box,

21:27.800 --> 21:33.000
that's a whole thing you can do. Uh, the time walking I noticed was a great catch up mechanic.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.120
I didn't want to do the cataclysm dungeons cause that's what's going on. But I was like,

21:36.120 --> 21:41.640
oh, I'll go do one. And I got so many points from doing the, the time walking as a healer.

21:41.640 --> 21:46.600
I was able to get like all this sweet gear to like bump my gear scores. It was really cool. So,

21:47.400 --> 21:52.520
um, Raginator says, wow, came out when? 2004? Yeah, that sounds about right. And Brad from

21:52.520 --> 21:58.520
Pod Culture at live.vognetware.com says time for wow remastered. Well, funny you say that because

21:58.520 --> 22:03.800
World of Warcraft classic is going to start, they're doing this weird thing. So

22:04.920 --> 22:12.520
it's not launching in November, but if you buy the virtual BlizzCon ticket that they want to sell you,

22:13.080 --> 22:18.840
you will have access to the demo for World of Warcraft classic, which kind of blows my mind

22:18.840 --> 22:25.000
because I'm like, how, what? It's, it's classic, just regular world and it's classic World of

22:25.000 --> 22:29.160
Warcraft. Why is there no, so basically they're selling you early access to World of Warcraft

22:29.160 --> 22:32.520
classic. That's what it is. That's just not where they're calling it. They're calling it a beta.

22:32.520 --> 22:36.600
Don't they have like a free demo right now for World of Warcraft, the regular World of Warcraft?

22:36.600 --> 22:40.760
If you want to, like you can play, it's either level 20 or level 40 you can, but again,

22:40.760 --> 22:45.720
there's 120 fucking levels. You can play for like free. So there's a lot you can do.

22:45.720 --> 22:51.720
There's your fucking demo. Why buy one? No, it's so, it's so weird. We're going to sell them and

22:51.720 --> 22:55.800
get this guys. We're going to sell them a demo for a game that's right now. That's free to play.

22:55.800 --> 23:00.040
Let's start off with, but we're going to even include less features in it and they're going

23:00.040 --> 23:04.200
to pay for it. That's what people want. They're only doing World of Warcraft classic because

23:04.200 --> 23:09.400
the fan base was like, I missed a day of molten core and back in my day you had to be level 40

23:09.400 --> 23:14.360
to get a mountain. You had to work for it. So finally, after all this rabble rabble and the,

23:14.360 --> 23:18.840
the servers, the fakie servers that Activision Blizzard finally had shut down, they were like,

23:18.840 --> 23:25.400
fine, you want classic World of Warcraft. We will spend resources to, to bring back classic

23:25.400 --> 23:30.440
Warcraft. But if you think about it, like, it's not as easy as making the old client available

23:30.440 --> 23:35.400
because like, like computers are vastly different. So they have to be re optimized.

23:35.400 --> 23:39.080
I would imagine they've got to go back and tune it now for widescreen

23:39.080 --> 23:42.040
because World of Warcraft back then didn't even support fucking widescreen.

23:42.040 --> 23:46.440
Fuck that. Don't make it widescreen. Make it four by three. This is what they fucking want.

23:46.440 --> 23:50.840
Let them have it. Just put some borders around it. I honestly think World of Warcraft classic

23:50.840 --> 23:55.480
will be that thing. You go back and play once and be like, wow, this wasn't as good as I remember

23:55.480 --> 23:58.840
because that's what always happens. It's never as good like the PlayStation classic.

23:59.800 --> 24:05.160
I think, wow, he's like old, but here's the thing. And I say this respectfully with many

24:05.160 --> 24:10.600
friends who love Blizzard products and as a Blizzard fan myself, Blizzard fandom is a cult

24:10.600 --> 24:16.680
and people will pay that money to do that. And, and Blizzard is the masters at this.

24:16.680 --> 24:21.080
And this is a company that's owned by Activision and Activision will charge you for whatever you

24:21.080 --> 24:26.120
want to buy. But here's the thing. Activision lets Blizzard do whatever they want because

24:26.120 --> 24:30.760
Blizzard is good at it. You will notice Blizzard has managed to really, for the most part, stay

24:30.760 --> 24:36.120
very independently Blizzard. There's very few things where Activision has kind of like

24:36.120 --> 24:40.680
come in and said, no, no, no. And that would be probably putting Destiny and Call of Duty

24:40.680 --> 24:46.280
on the battle net launcher. But what, but honestly, Activision's smart in doing that because they

24:46.280 --> 24:52.040
know Blizzard is a cult and the easiest way to bring awareness to Destiny is to put it on the

24:52.040 --> 24:58.040
battle net launcher. Imagine if people could buy the battle net launcher with wow gold, or I'm

24:58.040 --> 25:03.320
sorry, if people could buy Destiny 2 with wow gold, which you can, I mean, it takes a lot of gold to

25:03.320 --> 25:10.120
do it, but technically you can do it. It's crazy. But anyway. And again, I say that as a fan of

25:10.120 --> 25:15.080
Blizzard, because you know what else I played this week? Diablo 3, cause season 15 is going on.

25:15.080 --> 25:19.880
And now I'm sitting here going, I do kind of want to get this on the Switch, I think. And I'm,

25:20.200 --> 25:24.360
I'm like, I'm having that whole like angel and devil on the shoulders, except I actually think

25:24.360 --> 25:28.760
it's two devils yelling and screaming at each other because like I have one devil going,

25:28.760 --> 25:35.560
you fucking moron, you already own Diablo on PC and PlayStation 4. And I think Xbox 360 as well.

25:35.560 --> 25:39.080
Like I already owned Diablo 3 three times. Like, do I really need the Switch version?

25:39.080 --> 25:41.160
And then the other devil's going, of course you need it.

25:43.560 --> 25:48.760
Because it's new and shiny and everybody else is going to be playing it and it'll make for

25:48.760 --> 25:55.640
good live streams. It's the devil and the devil on my shoulder. Some of you have devils and angels

25:55.640 --> 26:02.680
on your shoulders. No, I have two devils. Anyway, what else did I do in my game a week? Oh, one more

26:02.680 --> 26:06.440
game that I definitely have to mention. One other game that I played this week, cause I did a live

26:06.440 --> 26:11.400
stream of this. I played Time Spinner, which is the brand new game that's been in development

26:11.400 --> 26:16.440
for a while. In fact, we had the developer of Time Spinner on OLR. It was a few years ago,

26:16.600 --> 26:21.880
it wasn't long after the Kickstarter. So it was a few years ago and Time Spinner came out and I

26:21.880 --> 26:26.040
played it on stream and it's fun. I mean, if you like Castlevania Symphony of the Night,

26:26.040 --> 26:33.800
bam. Time Spinner is a great homage to that. It's not like a carbon copy because the weapons are a

26:33.800 --> 26:38.840
little different. Obviously the bosses, the story is completely different. So it's not like you're

26:38.840 --> 26:43.720
just playing the same game. And also, they do some different stuff. Like you have a time stop

26:43.720 --> 26:47.880
mechanic, which as you kind of watch the way I'm thinking in the live stream, playing this game

26:47.880 --> 26:52.360
for the first time, I kind of realized like, oh, this time stop mechanic has many uses. Like,

26:52.360 --> 26:59.400
it's not like your typical, like get the double jump, which allows you to get up to this level

26:59.400 --> 27:03.080
that you couldn't get to before. And now you progress. Like that's, that's the way

27:03.080 --> 27:08.600
Metroidvanias have always worked, right? Now you have the underwater suit. You can go swimming and

27:08.600 --> 27:13.720
access the next level. Like, but the time stopping mechanic kind of has a variety of uses.

27:13.720 --> 27:20.520
Like you can use it to stop an enemy in midair. So you can effectively do a very amateurish double

27:20.520 --> 27:24.280
jump. Basically you jump on the monster, then jump on the ledge. You can do that. Or I found that

27:24.280 --> 27:29.720
using the time stop mechanic through trial and error, you know, watch me play that boss fight

27:30.280 --> 27:33.960
that I was stuck on for like 15 minutes, because you see me kind of thinking through,

27:33.960 --> 27:38.200
okay, I'm gonna do this boss the normal way. And then I realized, oh, using the time stop mechanic

27:38.600 --> 27:43.320
makes this boss a ton easier. And you can use this to kind of, you know, do something about

27:43.320 --> 27:47.480
the charges and some of the other things. Now, of course, your time stop mechanic is limited

27:47.480 --> 27:51.000
in how much you can use it. So you have to kind of be thinking about all that. But I like it,

27:51.000 --> 27:56.680
it added another layer to a formula that many of you are already familiar with. So I really

27:57.480 --> 28:02.680
like that. And Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, Rob buried the lead. His internet works now. Yes,

28:02.680 --> 28:06.680
I wanted to get to that. I was, you might've said I was able to live stream time spinner.

28:06.680 --> 28:13.400
So my internet is fixed at home. So here's the thing. So you remember Comcast tech number two

28:13.960 --> 28:19.480
came out last week. And although he was nice and he listened to my problem and he didn't try to

28:19.480 --> 28:25.240
sell me a BS answer, long story short, he wasn't able to fix the problem. So they were going to

28:25.240 --> 28:29.560
send a third lead out here. And I originally had him scheduled for Wednesday, but I forgot, oops,

28:29.560 --> 28:33.080
Alan had a doctor appointment Wednesday morning, so he couldn't be here in case the appointment

28:33.080 --> 28:36.840
ran long. So I was like, whatever, I've dealt with it this long. Let's just do two more days.

28:36.840 --> 28:40.120
So I rescheduled the third tech they were going to send out for Friday.

28:40.120 --> 28:43.400
I'm trying not to bore you with this story too much, but it's fucking fascinating.

28:43.400 --> 28:49.640
So Wednesday at around 11 o'clock, Alan messages me. He's like, I'm back from my doctor's

28:49.640 --> 28:53.240
appointment. It seems like the internet's down right now. Something, something must be going on.

28:53.240 --> 28:58.200
I'm like, all right, whatever. And he said noon, it came back up and he's like, wouldn't it be

28:58.200 --> 29:05.800
funny if... And then he goes silent for about 30 seconds and he comes back and he says, hahaha,

29:05.800 --> 29:09.960
I'm going to run out into the street and play in traffic. And he sends me a screenshot of the

29:09.960 --> 29:14.760
upload to Google working full speed. I'm like, so the internet, like, did the tech just come out

29:14.760 --> 29:20.040
here anyway and fix something? I don't know. But you know what I did notice, Loki, later in the

29:20.040 --> 29:25.240
weekend, they've been doing all this construction on a house around the corner. I don't know if you

29:25.240 --> 29:30.040
ever drive... I don't want to give away my home too much, but there's like a park there.

29:30.040 --> 29:33.480
And sometimes you drive around the park on purpose to get the pokey stops, right?

29:33.480 --> 29:34.120
I do.

29:34.120 --> 29:37.400
Okay. Yeah, I do too. Even though it's not the most direct route, I drive it to get the pokey

29:37.400 --> 29:42.440
stops. So there's a house over there as you go around. There's been an Xfinity van parked out

29:42.440 --> 29:47.720
there like three times this past week. And I'm like, oh my God, like whatever they're doing on

29:47.720 --> 29:52.040
that house, that was my problem. It probably wasn't. Maybe they were having the same problem.

29:52.040 --> 29:59.480
And then they found, oh, hey, it's like a splitter or something in one of these junction boxes

29:59.480 --> 30:05.080
that's fucked up. And so they went and fixed that. And lo and behold, it works for the whole

30:05.720 --> 30:06.360
neighborhood.

30:06.360 --> 30:10.520
Yeah. Bobby Bockel says, I bet the issue was at the main relay station that services your street.

30:10.520 --> 30:14.440
The last time I was having a bunch of issues, the problem was at the junction box. And I bet,

30:14.440 --> 30:17.640
you're right, either these people had the same problem or they had some other type of problem

30:17.640 --> 30:21.720
that caused them to go open the box. And that took down the internet for an hour on

30:21.720 --> 30:26.280
Wednesday. And then when it came up, magically worked again. So the most frustrating part of it,

30:26.280 --> 30:31.480
I mean, Comcast has been actually messaging me on social media. And they're really good

30:31.480 --> 30:36.040
about responding to you on social media if you have problems. Because I didn't even tag them,

30:36.040 --> 30:39.480
but they were like, hi, how can we help? Because they saw me bitching. So they were like, hi,

30:39.480 --> 30:42.680
how can we help? And so I sent private messages and they've been really good about responding

30:42.680 --> 30:46.680
and all that. But the problem is, because I kind of did it that way, to be fair, they don't know

30:46.680 --> 30:51.400
what the fuck happened. So it's like, I will never know why the internet went down. Y'all have some

30:51.400 --> 30:56.680
great theories and you might be right. You're probably right. But I don't a hundred percent

30:56.680 --> 31:00.360
know any of you are right. We will never a hundred percent know the reason why.

31:02.360 --> 31:06.680
I had issues where like our internet would drop for hours or whatever, and there'd always be like,

31:06.680 --> 31:12.680
you know, text in the area working on something. Eventually it fixes itself. It's dumb shit.

31:12.680 --> 31:17.400
Now I need to see what kind of credit I get for my upload not working. I think they already gave

31:17.400 --> 31:25.320
me like a $20 credit. I'll get nothing and I'll like it. Here's the other funny thing. Actually,

31:25.320 --> 31:31.080
the tech, this is not to derail into cable talk, but all you internet nerds have these

31:31.080 --> 31:34.840
same problems. Admit it. So the second tech was out here and he was looking at the problem.

31:35.720 --> 31:40.360
And then he looked at our TV thing. He's like that. And he points at the box that we were using

31:40.360 --> 31:44.840
is like, that is so old. We don't even support these anymore. Like, why do you still have this?

31:44.840 --> 31:49.400
And I was like, cause that's how often we watch TV and I don't know why we're paying for it.

31:49.400 --> 31:53.240
I do know why we pay for it. So I can watch RuPaul's drag race on my computer,

31:53.240 --> 31:57.000
basically through the Xfinity.com and all cause you can watch cable on your computer.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.920
You know what I do, which is what it's like. I pay for basic cable and I don't have the box

32:00.920 --> 32:05.720
hooked up. It's in a box. Cause you can use your computer. Cause, cause guess what they wanted to

32:05.720 --> 32:12.760
pay. They want me to pay for HD content. Where is I can just go online and watch that same HD

32:12.760 --> 32:18.280
content for no additional money. So you know what I got out of this whole thing. I got a new TV box.

32:18.280 --> 32:22.440
That's like a third of the size. Alan will watch TV once in a great while. Once in a great while,

32:22.440 --> 32:26.440
he's like, I'm going to go pet the kitty on the couch and watch CNN or something. And that's,

32:27.320 --> 32:33.080
but like I barely use, I'm I know I'm overpaying for cable, but well,

32:33.080 --> 32:36.440
are you in the United States? Yes. Then you're overpaying for cable.

32:36.440 --> 32:45.080
True. True. All right. Anyway, uh, let's see, going to chat at live.punknetwork.com.

32:45.080 --> 32:48.920
Uh, Dungeon Buster says I got the same reply when I returned a box that stopped working.

32:48.920 --> 32:53.720
Wow. I don't think we carry those anymore here. Have a new one. Um, Ray Sheeter says the credit

32:53.720 --> 32:57.800
will come in the form of Comcast giving you two middle fingers and a flaming bag of poop.

32:57.800 --> 33:02.040
You know, here's the thing though, for all Comcast issues, like I think Comcast knows they have a bad

33:02.040 --> 33:06.440
customer service rat because I will say with the exception of the first tech who is out here,

33:06.440 --> 33:09.800
who I wasn't here when he was here. So I'm getting all the secondhand through Alan,

33:09.800 --> 33:14.360
but everybody that I interacted with was like super nice and went out of their way to be like,

33:14.360 --> 33:17.720
Oh, it doesn't still work. I'm so sorry to hear that. Let's see what we can do. It's not,

33:17.720 --> 33:22.440
it's not that we, nobody wanted to say, well, can't fix it. Nobody's mad at like

33:22.440 --> 33:27.560
the customer service or anything. They're mad at the CEOs. It used to be that it used to be

33:27.560 --> 33:31.400
that way where everybody was like, God, those people over there are assholes. Uh,

33:31.400 --> 33:34.600
yeah. Some of their customer service in the past has been terrible because like,

33:34.600 --> 33:38.120
yeah, I remember talking to them and they're like, yeah, you could just pay less and you get,

33:38.120 --> 33:42.760
you know, faster speeds and you plus you get TV and stuff and then sure enough, you know,

33:42.760 --> 33:46.840
Oh, Hey, wait a second. Why is this bill more expensive than what I was paying for before?

33:46.840 --> 33:51.720
Oh, because that guy was a fucking liar is what it was. Oh, okay.

33:52.440 --> 33:57.640
Uh, anyway. All right. So anyways, sorry. Long enough deviation on my internet problems,

33:57.640 --> 34:01.720
but I bet, you know what, somebody out there, you're going to have the same problem eventually.

34:01.720 --> 34:05.240
Like this is just, everything's going to the internet. I think less and less people

34:05.240 --> 34:09.080
even using their TV. I think it's funny that I use my computer to do what the TV would do,

34:09.080 --> 34:13.240
but that's where my 4k monitor is. So I want to watch stuff in 4k go on my computer.

34:14.040 --> 34:19.480
Anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about, uh, uh, other announcements, which I really don't

34:19.480 --> 34:23.720
have anything as far as like upcoming shows off or anything. You know, I almost, I will tell you

34:23.720 --> 34:28.440
this. You guys might think this is funny. I was originally, when I came back from dragon con,

34:28.440 --> 34:33.320
I was originally going to take tonight off so I could go to Folsom street fair, which I haven't

34:33.320 --> 34:39.000
been to in like 15 years. Cause that was this weekend. Um, and I'm not talking about a street

34:39.000 --> 34:44.600
fair in the city of Folsom. I'm talking about the other one. Uh, because I, my friends always

34:44.600 --> 34:47.880
talk about it as a good time and I haven't been in so long. I was like, Oh, sure. I'll go.

34:47.880 --> 34:52.760
But because we had that show after dragon con that we had to call off, I was like,

34:52.760 --> 34:57.320
I don't want to take another show off. So that's why I'm here. So anyway, uh, we don't have any

34:57.320 --> 35:01.240
shows off planned for a little bit, but next week on the show, I don't even know if you know this

35:01.240 --> 35:05.640
Loki, I'm very excited about this next week on the show, we're gonna have a guest in studio.

35:05.640 --> 35:12.120
My friend Delvin is going to be here from Toronto and he is the host of a show called video game

35:12.120 --> 35:17.640
realness, which you can check out on iTunes. Yes. And, uh, well, because I also co-host

35:17.640 --> 35:21.160
reading is fundamental. The drag race podcast. I haven't talked a lot about on this show

35:21.160 --> 35:26.680
because it's not my show. I'm the host on psychic show, but it's there. And I also,

35:26.680 --> 35:30.200
I don't know how many of you that listen to this would enjoy that, but if you like drag race,

35:30.200 --> 35:35.480
go check it out. Reading is fundamental. Um, so he's going to be here in studio, so that's going

35:35.480 --> 35:40.280
to be a good time. So, uh, very excited to have him and welcoming him to the show next week. I

35:40.360 --> 35:46.680
can't believe that's only a week away. Oh, all right. Uh, let's get into other gaming news.

35:46.680 --> 35:50.920
There's a lot going on, lots of conventions, not just the street fair on Folsom street,

35:50.920 --> 35:56.360
but other conventions going on, right? Yes. That's right. Mine caught or my mine coughed mine craft.

35:57.400 --> 36:01.160
I thought you said my cock and I'm like, no, that's my cost. That's what happened. That's

36:01.160 --> 36:06.200
what's happening at Folsom right now. No, uh, Minecraft earth was this weekend. So they did

36:06.200 --> 36:10.840
a big live stream. I didn't watch it. I just caught the highlights because they waste way

36:10.840 --> 36:15.240
too much time with a bunch of streamers that I don't even know about or care about. This is more

36:15.240 --> 36:19.880
of like a thing that my kids might be interested in, but I don't know. So they did make some

36:19.880 --> 36:28.680
announcements. Um, so starting off, there was some new stuff coming in a, I am not sure what

36:28.680 --> 36:32.760
the next update's called. Um, cause I know the last one was aquatic, but they're going to be

36:32.760 --> 36:38.920
having some new stuff that has to do with the villagers. Um, lots of focus on that. So for

36:38.920 --> 36:47.000
example, with the villages, now they're going to be getting new biome, um, like new biome related

36:47.560 --> 36:51.640
architecture. So like stuff that's in the desert is going to kind of like desert architecture stuff

36:51.640 --> 36:55.480
that's in the jungle is going to look a little bit more jungle-y, you know, that type of stuff.

36:55.480 --> 36:59.080
The jungle is going to be more jungle-y. Is that what you said? No, the buildings. Cause right now

36:59.080 --> 37:03.240
the buildings are all the same. So like they're going to have, you can just see the patch notes,

37:03.240 --> 37:07.800
jungles are more jungle. Like in the desert, for example, they have like, like a street market

37:07.800 --> 37:11.560
set up and they have like little kiosks and stuff like that. And the villagers are dressed

37:11.560 --> 37:16.040
differently. Can't wait to go and wait. That's great that we're talking about the future of

37:16.040 --> 37:22.040
Minecraft, but where is the fucking 4k pack that they announced like over a year ago at E3,

37:22.040 --> 37:27.960
where's the super dude? And yes, I am going to bitch about Minecraft in 4k. Leave me alone.

37:27.960 --> 37:33.240
It looks great with the, the, uh, if you want your Minecraft in 4k, you're just going to have

37:33.240 --> 37:41.000
to play the Java version is what you're going to have to do. So, but you know what? And then along

37:41.000 --> 37:47.000
with that, they're also, they have, um, new, Oh, so yeah, the next Minecraft update is going to

37:47.000 --> 37:51.720
be called the village and pillage update. So, cause they have pillagers now, which are villagers

37:51.720 --> 37:55.480
that attack villages and they have like these beasts that are with them as well. So you can

37:55.720 --> 38:01.400
those off. Um, pandas are going to be in the game. Cool. They have a crossbow, which is pretty

38:01.400 --> 38:05.160
awesome. Wait, the pandas have a crossbow. No, you have a crossbow. I think the pandas should

38:05.160 --> 38:11.880
have a crossbow. What do y'all they pandas with crossbows? Yes or yes. Um, then of course, you

38:11.880 --> 38:18.200
know, they're going to have, um, the new scripting API is going to be coming soon. Uh, they're saying

38:18.200 --> 38:23.320
that they're going to be, is that so you can program the pandas to hunt people. Yes. So you

38:23.400 --> 38:27.480
can do that. And they also have animations that you can give you more customization options.

38:28.040 --> 38:33.640
Um, you can add particles and stuff to your different creatures and stuff. They released

38:33.640 --> 38:40.440
a new piece of content called inspiration Island, which is as big like Minecraft theme park type

38:40.440 --> 38:45.720
thing that you can go download for free inspiration Island sounds like a church retreat. Sorry.

38:45.720 --> 38:49.480
Well, there are people flying kind of religiously. So maybe it is, I don't know.

38:49.720 --> 38:54.920
They're fairly safe. They're feeling, but this, this though is right up your alley, Rob

38:56.280 --> 39:01.720
Minecraft dungeons, a dungeon crawler game. Yes. I heard about this. It sounds awesome. Tell me more.

39:01.720 --> 39:08.040
Yes. So, uh, Minecraft dungeons is Diablo Minecraft basically. Yeah. Set the same set

39:08.040 --> 39:12.840
in the same universe. Uh, they didn't really show too much as far as gameplay goes. Oh,

39:12.840 --> 39:18.280
I mean, it looks, it looks like it's going to be, you know, like a hack and slash

39:18.280 --> 39:23.960
Diablo type game. So child's first Diablo type of thing. Sign me. What do you mean child's

39:23.960 --> 39:27.880
first Diablo? Sign me the fuck up. This sounds great kids. If I want to get my kids into Diablo,

39:28.520 --> 39:33.640
you know? Oh, I see. So it's, it's Diablo without the Satan imagery and with, with, uh,

39:33.640 --> 39:38.360
Minecraft, cute, cutesy stuff instead. Yes. And pandas with crossbows. Of course.

39:41.240 --> 39:45.560
Awesome. You know, with mods, you can do anything. I know you can make those pandas have crossbows.

39:45.560 --> 39:50.840
I know. Or, or as a rage hater in chat says, pandas with crossbows that shoot tiny pandas

39:51.960 --> 40:01.560
have even tinier crossbows. Absolutely. Oh man. Yes. I need to set up that. We,

40:01.560 --> 40:05.080
we talked about doing a Minecraft server and then dragon con kind of threw everything off.

40:05.080 --> 40:09.720
We were gone to the realms. Yeah. Yeah. We'd still need to look at setting that up. So it'd be fun.

40:09.720 --> 40:13.400
But now that's, that's the thing I want on our realm is pandas with crossbows. Can you do that?

40:13.960 --> 40:17.720
Not yet. Cause the updates not out yet. I see. When do we have a date for the update?

40:17.720 --> 40:22.120
No. Okay. Well look forward to the, uh, VOG presents Panda with crossbow.

40:22.120 --> 40:26.520
They have like still like they haven't, I don't think they've released the mob that was

40:26.520 --> 40:31.320
unveiled in the last mine con earth. So there's still a little behind with things,

40:31.320 --> 40:35.720
but now cause cause you do in chat says they already have a Minecraft dungeon crawler. It's

40:35.720 --> 40:41.640
called fight the dragon. It's on steam. So, I mean, clearly other developers have probably

40:41.720 --> 40:45.560
taken the cutesy graphics of Minecraft idea and merged it with the dungeon crawler.

40:45.560 --> 40:50.360
I'm sure there is a rogue like with Minecraft graphics and I'm sure there is a battle royale

40:50.360 --> 40:56.520
game with mine. So indie developers have come up with it because you know, that type of art style

40:56.520 --> 41:01.960
is perfect for people like me that can't draw or, well, okay. It's funny. I used to be able to draw

41:01.960 --> 41:06.840
then I stopped drawing for a very long time. And funny enough, you lose your talent when you stop

41:06.840 --> 41:13.000
and don't practice something for a long, long, long time. Um, so unfortunately my art skills

41:13.000 --> 41:18.520
on the PC are not as good as they used to be. And so that's what I'm stuck with is Minecraft type

41:18.520 --> 41:26.200
art. Uh, going to chat, uh, Bobby Blackwell says, do you think we'll have pandas or 4k first pandas?

41:26.200 --> 41:33.960
How about 4k pandas? I'm going to tweet them right now. 4,000 pandas. When I'm tweeting them right

41:33.960 --> 41:43.560
now, could y'all retweet and fave when 4k pandas, and then the people listening on the, uh, podcast

41:43.560 --> 41:50.120
feed will be like, oh, that's why they tweeted that all of a sudden. I wonder what, um, was,

41:50.120 --> 41:54.040
I don't even remember what it was called. It wasn't the 4k update. It was like the,

41:55.240 --> 42:02.120
um, better graphics or I don't remember was not better to get. I, what did they call it? Like,

42:02.120 --> 42:06.200
it was like supposedly like something like it had to make a name. Maybe it was the 4k update.

42:06.200 --> 42:10.680
No, it was like the super duper deluxe graphics pack or something. They used a lot of like silly

42:12.200 --> 42:15.720
names in the, in the title of that super duper 4k graphics pack. That's it.

42:17.160 --> 42:24.120
I was close. So let's see. Here we go. Here's an article that was a couple months ago.

42:24.120 --> 42:29.120
Let's see what it says about, about the 4k updates. Um,

42:31.240 --> 42:38.360
thank you for your patience. Love Microsoft. That's it. Yeah. It doesn't really say it says,

42:38.360 --> 42:45.560
um, it's possibly pushed back to 2019. We don't know. So it's all speculation. They don't know

42:45.560 --> 42:50.600
vid power and chat says 4k blocky graphics is the future. You're damn right. But it was

42:50.840 --> 42:55.560
like about the blocks. It's about the water, the sunset, like if you want, it does look good.

42:55.560 --> 43:00.440
Go look at it. Like I tried to get like, and it's funny cause I have a graphics card that's

43:00.440 --> 43:05.960
truly capable of doing this crap. Yet for some reason, you know, it doesn't want to play nice

43:05.960 --> 43:11.240
with the newest version of Minecraft on the Java version. So I can't get, I have,

43:11.240 --> 43:17.800
I can't get the 4k like type stuff working like the, um, uh, Sonic ether.

43:17.960 --> 43:24.520
Was it Sonic ether or, um, it's one of those that has like the fun texture waters and the

43:24.520 --> 43:32.840
moving trees and stuff like that. But yeah, I don't know. It, it does look nice. I w I would

43:32.840 --> 43:38.280
like that update to come out, but I'm not holding my breath. All right. Well, I'll let you know if

43:38.280 --> 43:43.400
Minecraft replies to our tweet. All right. Cause you know, I'm sure that nobody else tweets them.

43:43.400 --> 43:48.440
Any demands ever. Let's talk about Pokemon. Go Loki's favorite game right now. He's wearing

43:48.440 --> 43:53.320
his gotcha on his wrist. I noticed. Is it running right now to get, um, it's not on right now.

43:55.000 --> 43:59.560
Do you have, um, issues where the settings change on you like randomly?

43:59.560 --> 44:04.360
Uh, if I have it in my pocket and I accidentally am hitting that little button without realizing

44:04.360 --> 44:11.160
it. Yes. I don't ever have it in my pocket. No, I don't know what's up with that. You know,

44:11.240 --> 44:16.680
there's an app you can, I have the app and that's what I use, but like I'll notice like I set it to

44:16.680 --> 44:21.320
basically I have it, you know, set the auto catch everything. Sure. But I turn the settings off on

44:21.320 --> 44:26.440
the notifications on in my app depending on what amount of regular pokey balls I have. No, I don't

44:26.440 --> 44:31.240
know what's up with that. And so like, I'll like have it auto spin the pokey stops and I'll notice

44:31.240 --> 44:35.480
it won't spin it and it's giving me the indicator. Oh yeah. Tap the button twice to spin the boogies.

44:35.480 --> 44:40.440
I'm like, I fucking told you the auto spin this shit. What the fuck? And then I go into the app.

44:40.440 --> 44:45.720
It's like, Oh yeah, we turn that off. And then like, you know, it'll be auto catch unknowns and

44:46.280 --> 44:50.200
it's like, Oh, sorry. You know, that's turned off too. It's like, what the fuck? So now every

44:50.200 --> 44:53.640
time I started, I have to check to make sure the same. They're correct. Interesting. No,

44:53.640 --> 44:57.880
I don't know what's causing that. So speaking of unknowns, do you have one yet? No, I need to trade

44:57.880 --> 45:02.840
you one from dragon con. I need them out of my inventory. Take one. Okay. All right. We're like

45:02.840 --> 45:07.240
three star friends, right? The start, it's only like 1600 stars. It's like four star friends.

45:07.240 --> 45:10.920
Yeah. We're getting closer. I actually, so for Pokemon go, I didn't talk about it during my

45:10.920 --> 45:15.800
game a week, but I hit a best friends with three people this week. One of them is act deft, um,

45:15.800 --> 45:20.440
who, uh, is there in the chat. So we actually hit four stars. And the nice thing is I was able to

45:20.440 --> 45:25.480
time the lucky egg every time. So I hit it with my friend, Kyle in Canada. I hit it with act theft.

45:25.480 --> 45:29.880
And then my friend, John here locally, who I used to live with when we were doing OLR,

45:29.880 --> 45:33.800
uh, when we were on Justin TV, he was my roommate during that period. So we all hit four star

45:33.800 --> 45:40.200
friends and I had my lucky egg going each time and I got 600 K XP from that crazy eyes on, um,

45:40.920 --> 45:48.760
Friday I walked six miles. Wow. Yeah. I'll never do that again. That was too, that was too far.

45:49.560 --> 45:54.920
Cause you know, were you trying to get a mime and a Kangaskhan that bad? Um, I did get a, I did get

45:54.920 --> 46:01.960
a, um, no, I didn't get him. I think I have a, my, I got a, um, far-fetched not far-fetched

46:01.960 --> 46:10.280
Toros. Um, the one that's dressed up like a woman. I don't remember the tangela. No, no,

46:10.280 --> 46:15.560
I've got one of those. Mr. Mime is a little, not mr mime. It's uh, the other jinx. I got a jinx.

46:15.560 --> 46:19.240
Finally. I didn't have a jinx. Oh, okay. That's not one of the rare ones though. But, um,

46:20.040 --> 46:26.200
no, I have a tangela. I have a few of those, but yeah, it's, um, but I was just surprised

46:26.200 --> 46:30.840
like, cause I, I, I forget that kilometers aren't as far as miles. And so like, yeah,

46:30.840 --> 46:34.280
that's like 10 kilometers right there. Well, as far as the walking event goes, uh,

46:34.280 --> 46:37.640
one thing that is worth saying about Pokemon go, something I want to talk about was that

46:37.640 --> 46:41.480
they just put out a tweet today. It says they have extended that until October 8th.

46:41.480 --> 46:46.600
So if you have not hatched your mr mime and your, uh, Kangaskhan that was supposed to end today,

46:46.600 --> 46:50.440
but they extended it through October 8th, probably because they're selling incubators and all that

46:50.440 --> 46:55.640
crap like crazy. I've been trying, I've been putting in seven K eggs all the time. Whenever

46:55.640 --> 47:01.000
I get, it's a low, the thing is it's a low, low dropper. It's like a 2% drop rate for a Kanga or

47:01.000 --> 47:05.720
a mime. No, I think Kanga is at 5% and mime is at two for some weird reason. There there's a chart

47:05.720 --> 47:10.440
on silph road, which is a great Reddit for Pokemon go. If you're not, uh, it's the silph road on

47:10.440 --> 47:15.480
Reddit. It's a great resource. Yeah. I walked, I walked, you know, cause you kind of know the

47:15.480 --> 47:20.360
area where my work is. So I walked all the way. I walked over the freeway cause they have that

47:20.440 --> 47:25.560
walking trail. It's over the freeway. I walked all the way from there all the way down the Kilgore.

47:25.560 --> 47:29.480
I went to the KP market on the way there and I went all the way down the Kilgore and it came

47:29.480 --> 47:35.000
all the way back. That is very far. That is six miles. Wow. Okay. Well, you know what? Like,

47:35.000 --> 47:39.560
I got to say that I'll give Pokemon go this like, you know, despite how ridiculous this egg event

47:39.560 --> 47:43.160
has been, even though I'm over it now, cause I have three Kangas and three mimes. So I've

47:44.920 --> 47:48.520
that I have also been doing a shit ton of walking because of it. You know what I do?

47:48.520 --> 47:52.920
I don't even use, use the gotcha because you know what credits walking better than anything,

47:52.920 --> 47:58.520
the watch. And it's the only thing that fucking watch app does decently. So I'll start my watch.

47:58.520 --> 48:03.080
I have an Apple watch and I'll start my, my walking and I'll do it. And it tracks very,

48:03.080 --> 48:06.360
and I can look anytime, see how much further I have to go. And it pushes me to walk more.

48:06.360 --> 48:13.240
So I got to say, if nothing else, you know what this game is like gamifying, walking and exercise

48:13.240 --> 48:18.840
in a way that everybody walks on the Nintendo DS. What was that? Never did. It was for me.

48:18.840 --> 48:23.800
It's my Fitbit. My Fitbits really motivated me to walk every day in like three months. Cause I

48:23.800 --> 48:28.360
walked, I do the three miles walking during lunch cause I can't do anymore. Cause that it's a really

48:28.360 --> 48:33.960
long time. I just, I got away with it on Friday because most of my team was gone. And so it's

48:33.960 --> 48:37.080
like, no one knows when I leave for lunch and no one knows when I come back, no one's paying

48:37.080 --> 48:45.400
attention. So I was able to walk for two hours, but, uh, you know, it's just three miles a day

48:45.400 --> 48:50.280
though. And then I do DDR at home. I mean, it's killer. Like my feet are just absolutely killing

48:50.280 --> 48:56.440
me at the end of the day. But, but then I have so many calories, eat things I want to eat and then,

48:57.080 --> 49:00.680
but I don't even eat all that stuff. And I didn't have tons of calories. I lost three pounds this

49:00.680 --> 49:04.520
last week, I think, or this week. Good for you working on it. Just don't overdo it. Like I said,

49:04.520 --> 49:07.800
I told you, I complimented you last week. It's noticeable. Uh, anyway,

49:07.800 --> 49:10.840
Brad from pop culture says there needs to be trading with long distance friends.

49:10.840 --> 49:15.640
I will say what is kind of cool though, is that the eggs still come from the place that they were

49:15.640 --> 49:21.160
sent from. So like one of my Kangas cons is a Mexican Kangas con thanks to act deaf because

49:21.160 --> 49:25.720
he had sent that egg, which opened up and ended up being a Kangas con. Uh, one of my Mr. Mimes

49:25.720 --> 49:30.840
actually the third Mr. Mime I opened is from Atlanta. So I know three people in Atlanta.

49:30.840 --> 49:35.720
So that egg either came from Bobby Black Wolf, his wife, or Charles from the Pokemon go podcast.

49:35.720 --> 49:39.800
I don't think, you know, which I need two more friends. I added Alan. I still need two more

49:39.800 --> 49:43.720
friends for that stupid quest. Put your code in chat. They'll help you out. I will.

49:44.760 --> 49:48.760
By the way, Curtis told me he got like a flutter request. Thank you guys very much. I appreciate

49:48.760 --> 49:54.520
that. Oh yeah. I need to add him. I forgot. There you go. Scroll up and chat. I saw Curtis last

49:54.520 --> 50:00.360
night cause um, his, his boyfriend was having a um, a birthday party and uh, I said, so how

50:00.360 --> 50:04.360
many people did you get from your phrase? Like, Oh my God, I have so many. So I was like, yay.

50:04.360 --> 50:10.440
So there you go. Anyway, that made me laugh. Uh, somebody just joined chat to say, I will add you.

50:11.400 --> 50:16.040
So get that code in the chat. Your problems will be over. You'll get, you'll get play. I have a lot

50:16.040 --> 50:21.000
of people that, you know, listen to us already. So I was just, you know, Well, it's nice. It's

50:21.000 --> 50:24.280
nice to know there's actually people out there and I will send you gifts. I have tons of gifts.

50:24.840 --> 50:28.520
Like I will not. I'm horrible at sending gifts and I was gonna say, I didn't get to finish my

50:28.520 --> 50:33.560
thought, but I said, Charles from the Pokemon go podcast adore him, but he's really bad with gifts

50:33.560 --> 50:37.160
and I understand why he's the host of the Pokemon go podcast. I'm sure he has 200 friends. He has

50:37.160 --> 50:42.360
max friends list. So I don't think the, in fact, I'm pretty sure the egg that the Mr. Mime was in

50:42.360 --> 50:48.360
did not come from him. It had to have been Bobby or Jennifer. So it was one of one of the two of

50:48.360 --> 50:54.120
them. Um, and actually I think it was Jennifer because Bobby's gifts usually come from not

50:54.120 --> 50:57.480
Atlanta. They come from a different city, which I don't know if he wants me to say on there,

50:57.480 --> 51:04.120
but he tends to send them from another city. So, um, yeah, there you go. Anyway. Um,

51:05.160 --> 51:10.200
that was where I, so I like that, that the eggs are labeled with where, what friend basically

51:10.200 --> 51:13.320
said, I'll just read it out on air. So if anybody's listening and it's not in chat,

51:13.320 --> 51:19.000
we can do that. So my friend code seven, two, four, six, seven, six, four, four,

51:19.000 --> 51:23.080
one, five, six, three. And I've already, Oh, and they're in chat as well.

51:25.960 --> 51:30.200
I'll add people now. Okay. So all right. You're brave. I won't, no, no offense, but I won't give

51:30.200 --> 51:34.680
my code out on air. Like you can ask for it, but I'm just like, when you ask for it, I'm going to

51:34.680 --> 51:38.680
give you my disclaimer that I'm really shitty with gift giving. Cause I just don't like today.

51:39.400 --> 51:43.720
I have been like, like lazy all that. I haven't left the fucking house yet,

51:43.720 --> 51:47.320
which I kind of need to do cause I need to go spin a pokey stop to get my street going. But like,

51:47.320 --> 51:51.960
I haven't gotten a single gift today to send out. So Sundays are just my lazy day.

51:51.960 --> 51:57.720
Yeah. And Brad, I've already got you. So, all right. All right. Anyhow. Uh,

51:57.720 --> 52:02.280
what I really wanted to talk about before we turned into a Pokemon go podcast. No, it's fine.

52:02.280 --> 52:07.080
There's a lot. Pokemon go is still popular. Uh, but one thing that we were talking about last

52:07.080 --> 52:12.840
week because these little nuttos, as people were calling him, the little nut things with

52:12.840 --> 52:18.760
the nut for a head that would, and I'm talking about an ACE hardware store, not the dirty thing.

52:18.760 --> 52:23.800
So yes, they did not have testicles for heads. It had a little ACE hardware nut for a head. And

52:23.800 --> 52:27.720
then like maybe like a diddly body and you would catch it. The real question though is

52:28.280 --> 52:36.040
has someone put the Royal crown on this thing yet? Shut up. Anyway. So, uh, the deal is that

52:36.120 --> 52:41.320
Pokemon was officially unveiled this week with the real name. It's not called nutto. It's called

52:41.320 --> 52:46.920
meltan is the actual name of that. Uh, and it is going to be a mythical Pokemon. So it's kind of

52:46.920 --> 52:51.080
interesting that those are out in the wild because I would think you were going to catch that, uh,

52:51.080 --> 52:54.920
through like a quest line or something in Pokemon go, but we'll see. They're still out there too.

52:54.920 --> 53:00.120
The meltans are still out there. I've noticed because the other day, because I had my thing

53:00.120 --> 53:03.320
catching Pokemon as I'm walking and stuff. And I looked at the other day, I'm like,

53:03.320 --> 53:08.280
why do I have 12 dittos? That's too many dittos. I don't need this many.

53:08.280 --> 53:11.560
Yeah. It's those dumb things. Well, if you're still stuck on that new quest,

53:11.560 --> 53:15.160
like you've just come back, like it's act, this is like the best thing that's going to happen.

53:15.160 --> 53:18.440
Yeah. Cause you find those. Yeah. Before they started this event with all the, you know,

53:19.000 --> 53:23.160
uh, ghastlies out there is like, Oh, catch ghost Pokemon. And it's like, now it's like,

53:23.160 --> 53:29.080
ah, that's no problem. Yeah. So anyway, um, so meltan is officially unveiled and it will be,

53:29.080 --> 53:35.560
uh, in a new po- it was unveiled in a Pokemon let's go trailer. So that is the new Pokemon

53:35.560 --> 53:39.720
that is going to be added to the Kanto Pokemon. Because again, if you weren't already aware,

53:39.720 --> 53:44.200
Pokemon let's go Pikachu and let's go Eevee is only going to future. At least for now. I don't

53:44.200 --> 53:48.440
know if they plan to expand it in the future, but only the gen one Pokemon, but they always tease,

53:48.440 --> 53:54.200
there would be one more Pokemon that is a brand new Pokemon also in it. And it is meltan. So

53:54.200 --> 53:59.000
it's kind of lame though. Well, it's, it is kind of neat though. Like kind of like Jason

53:59.000 --> 54:05.240
said in tonight's intro that basically Pokemon go is now that established part of the cannon

54:05.240 --> 54:12.520
where they have unveiled something that will affect the game boy games in the Pokemon go,

54:12.520 --> 54:17.880
uh, or, uh, not Pokemon go Pokemon. Let's go. You can actually increase the stats of your Pokemon

54:17.880 --> 54:22.600
that you have there too. So you can actually build those up to like a hundred percent or whatever,

54:22.600 --> 54:30.200
which is nice. Be, and also you will be able to send Pokemon from your Pokemon go into the

54:30.200 --> 54:36.040
switch. Let's go, but it will not go the other way. So if you weren't, if you're not already

54:36.040 --> 54:41.080
aware, it is a one way street. You send your poacher. I'm positive because that's, they don't

54:41.080 --> 54:46.760
want you to level all your stuff up and let's go and then send it back to Pokemon go. You'd be at,

54:46.760 --> 54:49.960
you'd throw off the balance of the game because I thought that was the whole point. I thought that

54:49.960 --> 54:54.280
you could store it like in the Poke ball or whatever and then you like walk and stuff and

54:54.280 --> 54:58.680
it levels it up and you can send it back. It's kind of a glow. Yeah, but you can't put it in

54:58.680 --> 55:03.640
Pokemon go is what I'm saying. And the Pokemon, basically that Poke ball is a glorified Pokemon

55:03.640 --> 55:07.160
go plus. I mean it, it will do a couple extra things. It sounds like too, but it's basically

55:07.160 --> 55:12.120
a glorified Pokemon go plus. All right, cool. Got my three friends. Yeah. Nice. Here you go.

55:12.120 --> 55:15.960
I just have the evolve a grass type and evolve and evolved grass type of one. Yeah. That would

55:15.960 --> 55:21.800
have been great last week. That just means like a Venusaur. I know. I know he means you have to

55:21.800 --> 55:25.960
find one of them. Oh yeah. Why didn't you do a new chicory today? You should. Well, right. I

55:25.960 --> 55:31.000
didn't have been chicory today. Well, that's fine. I have tons of bubble sores and stuff.

55:31.000 --> 55:36.440
All right. And I was gonna say, just get the candy and evolve the second form or whatever

55:36.440 --> 55:40.760
takes a hundred candy. Anyway. Yeah. All right. Um, moving on. That's plenty of Pokemon go talk.

55:40.760 --> 55:43.720
Let's move on. Loki. You've hinted at this a bunch, which you're about to talk about.

55:43.720 --> 55:48.520
We've already kind of brushed this topic because Microsoft officially said officially

55:48.520 --> 55:54.920
said something on this. So they were working with razor, um, to help add support for keyboard and

55:54.920 --> 56:01.400
mouse to games on the Xbox one. And so now they're enabling keyboard mouse support on Xbox one for

56:01.400 --> 56:06.840
select Xbox insiders for the next few weeks. And then, um, right now it's going to be a game by

56:06.840 --> 56:11.160
game thing. Developers bill to choose whether they want to implement it or not. That's pretty

56:11.160 --> 56:16.120
cool that they're going to do that. And he said most wired and wireless keyboards and mice will

56:16.120 --> 56:21.960
work on the Xbox one, which yeah, I would think so. It's just a keyword, a mouse. I mean, I can't

56:21.960 --> 56:26.680
imagine a keyboard mouse that wouldn't work. Um, and then of course they're going to also have

56:26.680 --> 56:30.840
maybe some razor gear that's going to have the Xbox logo on or something like that. But

56:31.960 --> 56:37.080
it's interesting in somewhat like this. It makes me think unless, you know, of course they disable

56:37.080 --> 56:43.320
it. But, um, you know, like Fortnite or not Fortnite, but, um, I guess the Fortnite would still

56:43.320 --> 56:47.800
work too, but I would think that you would want to differentiate this person's on a keyboard mouse,

56:47.800 --> 56:52.040
this person's in, you know, on controller. Kind of like I was mentioning about the,

56:52.040 --> 56:58.280
what DDR used to do. Yeah. So, so I don't know. Um, that's going to be very interesting if, uh,

56:58.280 --> 57:02.760
they start kind of allowing, I mean, it's weird because like PlayStation four already allows

57:02.760 --> 57:08.280
keyboard and mouse, but so few games on certain games. Yeah. It's basic. The only one I can think

57:08.280 --> 57:12.760
of is Final Fantasy 14. I don't know anything else that uses keyboard and mouse. And what's funny is

57:12.760 --> 57:18.200
that back on the Xbox 360, I used to play Final Fantasy 11 with a keyboard on 360. So it's weird

57:18.200 --> 57:21.960
to me that Xbox one, like we haven't been talking about keyboard and mouse, but we're talking about

57:21.960 --> 57:25.880
more than just MMOs. We're talking about like using a keyboard and mouse to play first person

57:25.880 --> 57:30.280
shooters, which I don't think any of these things have ever done. See, this is this right here is

57:30.280 --> 57:36.200
a perfect point. It's like, this doesn't seem like that big a deal, but you think about it. I mean,

57:36.920 --> 57:42.840
this is basically, it's like Microsoft is listening to their users. Like, yeah,

57:42.840 --> 57:47.000
this is why we have backwards compatibility. This is why we have cross play. This is why we have mod

57:47.000 --> 57:50.920
support. This is why we have keyboard and mouse now it's because they're listening to what people

57:50.920 --> 57:57.080
want and they're giving them what they want, which I got to tell you, it goes a long way, you know,

57:58.040 --> 58:02.920
towards when it comes to that next console, you're going to be thinking about, okay,

58:02.920 --> 58:07.240
do I want the console that, you know, got its head up its ass because they think they're the

58:07.240 --> 58:11.640
greatest thing on, you know, the earth. And, but yet they don't support these things. Where am I

58:11.640 --> 58:16.600
going to pick this other console that has more support towards user-generated stuff and more

58:16.600 --> 58:21.800
things that fans have been asking for? Because right now it used to be a performance issue

58:21.800 --> 58:25.880
between the 360 and like the PlayStation 3, whereas the games would perform better on the

58:25.880 --> 58:32.600
360, which is weird. Why did I get a PlayStation 4? But I don't know. And then exclusive games,

58:32.600 --> 58:37.000
I guess, you know, but is that really all you play is exclusive games? No,

58:37.000 --> 58:43.640
you play mostly cross platform games and, you know, which system is it going to play better on?

58:43.640 --> 58:51.000
I don't know. All right. Well, yeah, I mean, with that whole thing, because I'm looking at chat,

58:51.000 --> 58:54.680
Orange Right says I could see people complaining about people having an advantage with keyboard

58:54.680 --> 58:58.680
and mouse though over controller. Well, haven't we now opened that box thanks to cross play?

58:58.680 --> 59:02.920
I mean, the cross play you fought so hard for on PlayStation 4, now you're going to be playing

59:02.920 --> 59:08.440
against PC people who are using keyboard and mouse, right? So this is something we kind of

59:08.440 --> 59:15.480
have to figure out now, I think. So we'll see. Anyway, let's move on and talk about Nintendo

59:15.480 --> 59:19.400
online cloud saves. Now we've talked about this a little bit already in the past about this whole

59:19.400 --> 59:24.520
system, but it was clarified this week that the cloud saves are going to be, and of course now my

59:24.520 --> 59:29.320
site isn't loading, but I believe the cloud saves are going to be there for six months. So if you

59:29.320 --> 59:33.320
were a panic that Nintendo was going to delete your save, as soon as you let your Nintendo online

59:33.320 --> 59:37.880
account expire, Nintendo did clarify that it's still going to be there for six months. I still

59:37.880 --> 59:43.400
think many people would like to know that they could do a physical backup of some sort of those.

59:43.400 --> 59:47.480
And I think that's what people would really like to be able to do is just like use a USB stick,

59:47.480 --> 59:52.040
you know, kind of like the other consoles that you do. But at this time, at least it's not going

59:52.040 --> 59:55.960
to be that your cloud saves are just going to disappear the first day anyway. So at least we

59:55.960 --> 01:00:01.720
know that much, right? Yes, this is, I think, reasonable. This is basically putting them in

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:07.720
alignment with other services. So I'm completely fine with this now. Yeah. I mean, this is really

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:11.720
how they should have done it from the get go. And I'm glad it didn't take them very long to

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:18.280
realize that this is probably something they should do. Yeah. Anyhow, also, a little talk

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:23.640
about Virtual Console has slipped out there. And again, my site isn't loading, but I'm going off

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:29.720
of what I remember of this story is that they had said that there was in the files for the eShop,

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:34.040
I think, had recently been updated. And in those files for the eShop were references to Virtual

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:38.680
Console. So people were going crazy going, oh, my gosh, it's going to be Virtual Console. But

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:42.520
there's thought that they might have just copied over some type of master database file from the

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:47.400
3DS. So this might not quite be what you think it is. Yeah. So basically, a switch to Datamire

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:53.240
notice that switch eShop JSON file had just been updated and now contains references to

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:59.880
the terms Virtual Console, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance and DS.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:03.240
And now there's two way. They basically said there's two ways to look at this. Perhaps

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:09.400
it's just a carryover from the 3DS or on the other hand, maybe it's just something to hint

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:13.640
that there's a Virtual Console service coming on the switch. Well, Nintendo hasn't said anything

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:20.520
about Super Nintendo or GameCube. Well, actually, what I think this would really be for would be

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:26.040
Wii and GameCube. I think if we're going to go, why wouldn't they just sell the freaking Wii games

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:30.680
like they were doing on Wii U for a little bit? Why not sell those full functional games? Maybe

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:35.640
though, since there's no infrared bar, maybe it's not as easy as I think it is. Although wouldn't

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:39.560
those controllers be able to emulate the function, but they couldn't tell where you were pointing,

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:44.840
could they? Because there's no infrared sensor. It would be very difficult. Yeah.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:50.040
Some games would work that didn't maybe use the infrared. So like, you know, you could do like

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:54.520
an excite truck or something like that, but then you would need to. And also there's, you remember,

01:01:54.520 --> 01:02:01.480
there's the games that they had on the Nvidia Shield in Korea or China or wherever the hell it

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:07.800
was where they actually had Wii games. And some of those did work. Like I can't remember. I don't

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:11.560
remember how they got around. I think what they did as far as like the pointer stuff, they just

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:16.760
use the second analog stick as the pointer on the screen. So you just would have like a cursor or

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:21.480
something like that. So maybe that would work, but it's not going to work for all games, but not

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:26.920
every single game use motion controls either. So it may work for some things. Okay. Good to know.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.400
All right. Well, let's move on just a couple more stories before we get to the classic game

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:38.920
of the week. Loki. All right. So PlayStation is not going to be doing a PlayStation experience

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:46.280
for 2018. They are going to be skipping 2018 and waiting until next year. So they said for 2018,

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:49.000
I know this is going to be a disappointment for some people, but we decided not to hold

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:56.360
the PlayStation experience this year. We wouldn't have had enough to bring people all together in

01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:01.080
some location in North America to even have an event. We don't want to set the expectations

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:08.120
really high and then not deliver on it. So interesting that they're not going to be doing

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:12.280
anything. I mean, I guess it makes sense. They kind of released a bunch of stuff already. Maybe

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:20.200
the other stuff that they showed is just not ready yet. But guess what? Microsoft has your back

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:28.680
because they've got XO 18 coming November 10th and 11th to Mexico City. So it's going to be the

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:35.480
fourth annual Xbox Fan Fest. So PlayStation is not having a fan fest, but Microsoft is.

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:41.560
And it's interesting about the Microsoft one is it's not in the U.S., Europe. They're having it

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:46.360
in Mexico. So it's kind of interesting how Microsoft is trying to appeal to a broader

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:51.160
global community. Yeah. Kind of what that says to me. And then, of course, they're going to show

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:56.040
they said they're going to have the largest Inside Xbox episode ever. During that time,

01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:00.280
there's going to be some first looks and surprise live streams. And they're going to be doing some

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:05.640
coverage through Mixer throughout that weekend. So basically, they'll be doing some announcements,

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.880
maybe. I mean, I don't know how high you want to set the bar, but maybe akin to

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:15.800
what they were doing at PSX when they were doing PSX in the winter. Remember how they would do

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:20.840
quite some big unveiling at that expo and maybe they just didn't have the unveiling this year.

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:26.440
What do you think caused Sony to say not this year? Maybe they just had a lot of maybe they

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:31.640
just released a bunch of games and so they don't really have like maybe The Last of Us 2 and

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.920
the other games that they were showing off at E3 are just not.

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:39.240
I mean, I guess they could do the E3 demos and stuff, but they didn't want to recycle

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:45.960
the same thing. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Let's see. Going to chat at live.vognetwork.com

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:50.280
actdeft, who's in Mexico, but obviously Mexico is a very big place is in a very different part.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:54.120
He says, I kind of want to go to the XO18 event, but it's too close to plan. And I have stuff to

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:59.800
do that weekend. So he probably want to get out there. It sounds like, but that's still kind of

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:05.800
neat that we'll have that convention and can watch a feed on. Hopefully the feed is in English or

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:09.960
we'll have subtitles or translate or something. Yeah, hopefully. So we can understand whatever

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:12.920
the announcements are. That would be pretty exciting. But I do find that very interesting

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:18.280
that maybe Microsoft's targeting a more global type of build. If they're losing the war in Japan,

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:23.080
why not try to win it in Latin America? You know, it's interesting. It's interesting. It's

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:29.160
interesting tactic. We'll see how it works. All right. Anyhow, let's talk about some more of the

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:36.680
fallout from Telltale's sudden closure. Stranger Things over on, which was a game that Telltale

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:41.000
was supposed to be doing for Netflix. Netflix has come out and said, they're still going to do it.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.040
They're still moving ahead with the Stranger Things game. They said in a statement, we are

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:50.360
saddened by news about Telltale games. They develop many great games in the past and left

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:54.280
indelible mark on the industry. Minecraft story mode is still moving forward as planned. We are

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:58.760
in the process of evaluating other options for bringing the Stranger Things universe to life

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:03.400
in an interactive medium. So they're not letting that go. And did you see that tweet from Devolver?

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:08.360
Where Devolver was basically like, if you want to give it to us, we'll do it. And we'll hire

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:12.280
former Telltale devs to help. And they were, they already knew what studio would do it too.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:18.200
Is there studio that did code or something? Yeah. No code. So, um, yeah, I thought that was very

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:22.280
interesting. So, uh, we'll see where this game ends up. And I think that would be very cool

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:28.360
if some, uh, Telltale people were able to get, get jobs, uh, uh, helping to build this. Although

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:32.120
I think that developer was in Europe. So some people may not want to uproot all the way to

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:35.880
Europe, but maybe, you know, something, maybe something can be workable. Who knows? Um,

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:41.720
other news about Telltale though, and this is the part that in some ways I think is more fascinating,

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:48.840
uh, just to me to kind of watch, like all this news kind of going out is because, um, so people

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:53.640
bought the full walking dead season in advance with the expectation that the walking dead

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:59.160
episode one, two, three, four, the final season would be released as they've always been. But

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:04.680
Telltale closed right before episode two came out. Episode two still came out because like,

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:07.640
it was the Friday before the Tuesday it was supposed to come out. So it was probably in

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:11.720
the box ready to go, so to speak. So episode two still came out, but we have no plan. We have no

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:15.880
word on how they're going to get episode three and four out, or if they will, because they basically

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:20.360
already sold this to some people. Uh, so some people are pissed off because essentially it's

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:25.240
stolen money. If these games disappear, it's basically stolen money. But on the flip side,

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:30.920
if Telltale were to continue to develop these games, which by the way is the statement from

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:35.720
Telltale that says, hi everyone, we have a walking dead update for you. Multiple potential partners

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.680
have stepped forward to express interest in helping to see the final season through to

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:42.440
completion. We can't make any promises today. We're actively working towards a solution

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:45.960
that will allow episodes three and four to be completed and released in some form.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:49.800
In the meantime, episode two will release tomorrow across all platforms as planned.

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:55.080
We hope to have answers for your other questions soon. So, okay, either they're going to turn it

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:59.320
over to another developer who's expressed interest in buying it for a share of the profit or

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:02.840
something, or maybe they're going to outsource it. I don't know, but at the end of the day,

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:07.320
then you have to kind of look at it and go, okay, well, they're going to deliver on this thing that

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:12.280
they sold, but at what price? Because they fucked over their developers that they fired

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:18.920
without severance. There's a class action lawsuit now because yeah, I saw that too. So, um, but now

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:23.080
it's like, okay, so even if they get these games finished, the people that are going to get paid

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:27.160
for it, is it going to be the people who really put their heart and soul into the story story and

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:31.400
the people who made it, it doesn't seem like it will be because those people were not given any

01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:37.960
types of severance. So in a way, it's almost better if Telltale just like fucking doesn't

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:43.080
do the followups and offers to refund the money, which they probably can't do. We all know they

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:48.360
can't do because of this bankruptcy, this sudden thing they've done. So the executives at Telltale

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:55.080
fuck the company pretty good. And unfortunately, fuck the customers, fuck their employees,

01:08:55.080 --> 01:09:01.560
and now, you know, who knows what's going to come of this? Who would have thought, you know,

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:06.120
at the beginning of the year, we'd be talking about Telltale like this, who would have thought?

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:10.680
I know it's crazy, right? Well, some people would have tell you this was a long time coming,

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:14.760
but that's neither here nor there. Anyway, apparently things haven't been running well

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:20.360
there for quite some time, but anyway, I'm not one to go. So anyway, let's, let's go back to a

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:24.760
time when you know what, it was just, it was, it was more nor there wasn't episodic games. There

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:30.440
was cartridge games and you got one. That's it. We're going to take a step back in time and we're

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:35.960
going to go way back in time. Thanks to radio magic and check out the classic game of the week.

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:44.440
And so we travel back in space and time to bring you the classic game of the week

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:48.840
where dark soccer is going to join us via Skype this week. Hi Jamie, how are you?

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:54.600
I'm all right. How are you? I'm good. You don't have to lie to the listeners. You've been under

01:09:54.600 --> 01:10:00.840
the weather. That can't be super good. Yeah. I have a sinus infection, which as usual,

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:07.480
it goes right into my lungs. Well, I'm glad you could fight all that to still join us

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:12.760
this week here on Orange Laundry to bring us the classic game of the week. Because as I always say,

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:17.000
you step into the gaming vault and find a game that you've been playing where you're like, Hey,

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:21.560
you brats play this game or I'm going to punch you in the face. So what is the classic game

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:28.120
of the week? Popeye. Yay. I love, I love this game. This is one of those games where

01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:34.040
I was just, this is one of those games where how have we not done this game before?

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:40.760
I love this game. No idea, but I'm going to punch people the way that Popeye punches vultures

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:49.640
by eating some spinach. Although canned spinach is gross. True story. When I was a kid,

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:54.920
my mom used to buy the Popeye brand canned spinach so that my brothers and I would eat it.

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:58.920
Oh, I can't. Spinach is like the grossest way to do it.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:05.960
It is totally gross, but it works when you're making lasagna though. And it works in this game.

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:13.400
Yes. So Popeye came out in 1983 and it was developed and released by Nintendo.

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:18.040
Of course, based on Popeye from King, a future syndicate.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:29.480
As a platformer though, you couldn't jump, you had a punch button. So it also was licensed by

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:37.880
Atari to be released in the UK and Ireland. And it actually had an Atari cabinet for them as well.

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:47.000
It also was supposed to be eventually what became Donkey Kong. The characters were going to be used

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.080
in another game, but Nintendo couldn't get a license for it. So then Donkey Kong came around.

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:58.920
So into the actual gameplay, you have to collect a certain number of items that are

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:08.680
dropped by olive oil. 24 hearts, 16 music notes, or 24 letters in the word help. You have to avoid

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:16.520
the sea hag, Bluto or Brutus as he was in this one and other, you know, things. He walks back

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:20.840
and forth and up and down the stairs. They use a four-way joystick. There's a punch button,

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:29.400
but no jump button like in other games. He can jump down a level, well Brutus can jump down a

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:36.520
level, or stoop and reach the levels below. He can also reach Popeye on levels above.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:43.800
Your enemies that you have, apart from, you know, the big bads like the sea hag and them,

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:48.680
are vultures, which, you know, whatever game, can you punch a vulture in the face?

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:56.680
Skulls and bottles. And then you can get a can of spinach in each level. They'll get Popeye

01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:03.400
invincibility and they can knock out Bluto Brutus by running into him, although he will swim back

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:11.480
out and try to, you know, get you again. Round one is the dock and you have a three-round cycle

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:18.040
that takes you off to different levels. And then the four-round cycle is you have the pogie bag,

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:23.960
which you can knock loose a barrel to get stuff out of. The barrel can also fall on Brutus's head.

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:30.360
You get points for that too. So other characters in the game, you also have olive oil, like I said,

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:36.840
sweet pea and wimpy, you know. I will gladly pay you tomorrow for a burger today.

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:44.600
And then, you know, you get, you lose life if you were hit by any of the baddies.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:50.200
There were other releases. There were ports to the TRS-80, Color Computer 2,

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:59.000
Commodore 64, the TI-99-4A, Atari 8-bit, Intellivision, Atari 2600, Atari 5200,

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:04.120
ColecoVision, which was one of the good versions of it. And it was also one of the games that was

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:11.000
ported to the Odyssey 2. There is a board game based on this that came out in 1983,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:18.120
and a Popeye tabletop video game with a color LCD, but it was not based on the arcade game.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:26.600
It also was released later on in 1983 for the Famicom along with Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr,

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:33.080
ported by Parker Brothers, except for the Nintendo version that was handled by Nintendo itself,

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:41.560
the NES, sorry. It was, basically it even had a sequel for the Famicom that came out

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:50.120
on November 22, 1983, which was Popeye no Eigo Asobi, which basically translates to

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:58.760
Popeye's English Game, which also came out along with the later Donkey Kong Jr. Math.

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:06.120
And Namco did one in 2008 where they did an enhanced remake for mobile phones

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:15.640
that also had a bonus stage, and then an extra level that actually played to a Popeye short

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:21.240
called A Dream Walking, where Popeye had to save the sleepwalking olive oil and had some

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:26.760
trivia stuff in there. And then you could earn tokens, which you used to buy old comic strips

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:32.520
from, you know, the Simple Theater that later became the full Popeye shorts. And there you go.

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:38.840
All right. That was the game. I love this game. I had this on Commodore 64,

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:41.960
so that's the version I remember. And I don't remember being very good, but,

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:47.640
you know, just kind of like looking back on this game, I can't believe how much the computer gets

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:54.280
to cheat because Bluto can't, you know, he can kind of get you above, he can get you below,

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:57.720
so you kind of have to really like watch out for him or like psych him out and try to get him to

01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:02.440
go early. And now I'm watching this playthrough that we're getting the music from, and I didn't

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:06.680
even remember this. Maybe the Commodore 64 version wasn't programmed for this. But once you get

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:12.360
through that three round cycle, you go back to the first port, obviously, with the hearts,

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:18.360
and now I see that the Sea Hag is throwing skulls at you as if the bottles weren't enough.

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:24.040
Yeah, and don't forget vultures too. Yeah, the vultures are in the last,

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:29.480
they're in the pirate ship, the help stage. Yeah, but you can punch them in the face.

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:33.480
You can punch them. I was actually watching the player in this video is punching the

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:37.000
vulture in the face pretty much as much as possible. It's pretty impressive.

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:45.000
Yeah, there it is. All right. Your classic game of the week, Popeye for originally the arcade,

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:50.200
but then was really released everywhere else in the 80s. As Jamie outlined everywhere that it

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:56.280
could be in the 80s, even the Odyssey two. So we have a little extra time here, but I know

01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:59.960
you're sick and want to go soon. But I thought I would bug you a little bit because I know,

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:03.000
didn't you end up going to the Transformers thing still on Thursday?

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:08.600
Yes, I did. Well, we'd had our tickets for a month. There's no way I was missing that,

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:13.640
although I did have to step out halfway through the movie. Sure. But I came back in time for

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:20.920
dare to be stupid. Which if you don't make that the the fortune cookie, I'm going to cry.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:26.200
I will try my best to remember. But between the time that we're taping this and the time

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:30.920
the show is live, I may I may forget. So maybe the chatters have to text you to pester you.

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:35.400
What's that? I will text you to pester you. That's a great idea. I always

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:40.440
appreciate a text message from Dark Sakura. I treasure everyone. I have a folder.

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:46.840
Like the ones where I harass you at work. The thing is, she's not lying.

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:51.560
Rob, I found this meme. Coffee.

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:57.320
All right. And you're still Trixie Mattel on my phone.

01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:00.200
Yeah, you're still Katya on my phone. Heart. Yay.

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:07.960
Any parting thoughts for the listeners as we go back to the present time?

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:14.920
Well, I wanted to say one thing actually about seeing Transformers the movie is that

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:18.040
a bunch of people did actually stay in the theater to watch the whole credits.

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:24.040
And after the movie, there was actually an interview with Stan Bush, who did, you know,

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:29.480
the touch and saying dare in the movie. But he's talking about just, you know,

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:36.200
how those songs kind of changed the course of his music and how it was actually recorded for

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:39.400
the movie Cobra with Sylvester Stallone. Oh, wow.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.280
Yeah. And then he's like, it ends up in some cartoon. Hey, this is pretty cool.

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:53.640
All right. Well, I'm gonna have to get my tickets for next time, I guess, since I missed it this

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:58.360
time. But, you know, Jamie, I do have my tickets for Gaga's Star is Born. So I'm very excited

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:05.160
about that. I kind of want to see it because I haven't. I did see like the one that wasn't

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:09.480
like the 70s. The Barbra Streisand one or the Judy Garland one?

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:13.400
The Barbra Streisand. Okay. You know, the interesting thing?

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:17.720
Because of Barbara and she's like Butta. She is like Butta. The interesting thing,

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:21.800
I'll leave you with this little random ass fact that has nothing to do with games, but deal with

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:27.240
it. So, you know, this is gonna be the fourth Star is Born movie because there was the Judy

01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:33.640
Garland one, the Barbra Streisand one, and there was one in the 1930s. Well, the Star is Born from

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:41.560
the 1930s is public domain now. So because I guess the license was never renewed or something

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:46.600
happened with it, where it didn't like it is now in the public domain. So you can actually watch

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:51.880
the entire like Star is Born from the 1930s like on Wikipedia and stuff and on YouTube because it's

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:54.440
public domain. That's cool.

01:19:54.440 --> 01:20:00.840
Kind of interesting, huh? Little random fact. Yeah. Maybe that's something that we should do

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:04.680
one night is just have classic movies. Yeah. And we can stream it.

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:08.200
Yeah, because they're public domain. With commentary.

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:13.640
You could do that. And there's some. There's a few modern movies that fall in that category,

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:18.280
too. Like Wikipedia has a whole article on it. Like, you know, do what I do and stay up until

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:24.520
2 a.m. reading random Wikipedia articles. And there's a Wikipedia article on movies that are

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:29.800
in the public domain and why. It's fascinating. I wonder if any of our listeners would like that,

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:33.800
like on our twitches. Like, watch Rob and Jamie watch old shit.

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:38.680
Why not? Let us know in our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord. Cheap plug.

01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:40.200
Do it.

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:43.400
All right. Any party shots here, Jamie, while we go back?

01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:46.680
I like Sudafed.

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:57.560
Thanks, Jamie. And I hope the Sudafed is working and you're feeling much better.

01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:02.600
Meanwhile, we've got some more gaming news to get into, including some rapid fire news before

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:07.480
we get to your calls. Still on Skype for now at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. But

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:12.840
the first Loki wants to start us off with some rapid fire news. So there's been an announcement

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:17.480
that Castlevania Symphony of the Night and Rondo of Blood will be coming out on PlayStation 4

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:23.400
October 26. It's going to be a collection of the two games for the first time available digitally

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:27.240
together. And that's coming out on the 26th of October.

01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:30.040
Well, it's kind of a lie because didn't they do this on the Vita?

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:35.160
I don't think they were together, though. I thought they were together on the Vita.

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:37.240
Oh, well, it doesn't matter. Whatever the case may be.

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:40.040
We have confirmation on that thing that leaked last week.

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:46.280
Yes, exactly. So neat. Check it out. I don't like the fact that their letterbox,

01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:50.360
or not letterbox, but like in a frame. I wish they had a way to like, you know,

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:54.680
enhance it or something like that. But going to chat at live.vognetwork.com,

01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:59.000
Dark Tetsuya says, I'm mad it's a Sony exclusive, but what can you do? Frown.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.520
You know, that's a good point. I saw some people kind of bellyaching on Twitter a little bit about

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:06.840
that. I shouldn't say a negative word like that, but, you know, some people giving feedback on

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:13.320
Twitter that, you know, it's weird that they just announced Simon for, you know, Super Smash

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:19.480
Brothers Ultimate. And yet the Switch, none for you buy. This is a PlayStation exclusive.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:23.480
Maybe a timed exclusive. You never know. Could be. Maybe. Maybe they've got something

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:26.360
else in store for the Switch. Don't hold. Don't lose hope.

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:31.800
There's a lot of those DS games of the Green Master that, you know, pretty good. So.

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:39.480
Then, of course, another flashback console. But you may be asking, well, what,

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:45.160
what possible system could this be for? And the answer that I have no fucking clue because it's

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:51.720
a bunch of games and they're just from fucking everything. So it's called the Legends Flashback

01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:57.800
Consoles coming out October 1st. So tomorrow, it's because it's a hodgepodge of licenses from

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:04.280
like Capcom and like Taito. I don't remember all that. Yeah, it's a Capcom Bandai Namco.

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:12.280
There's Tetris, Data East, Acclaim. So you got a big bunch of games all kind of jammed in there.

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:16.840
So what can you expect with it? Well, they've got stuff like Bad Dudes versus Dragon Ninja,

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:22.280
Burger Time, Super Burger Time. That's all I need. I'm good. Let's get it. Galaga,

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:29.960
you know, Joe and Mac, Mappy, Mega Man 1 and 2. They have Super Street Fighter 2, Strider.

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:38.920
Of course, Tetris and lots of other things. Total of 50 games in all.

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:44.760
And how much is it going to cost? I have no idea because they didn't mention that.

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:50.120
But it will be HDMI, have Safe States and Rewind. And it looks like they have Sega Genesis type

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:59.080
controllers. So hooray. Hooray. All right. Christmas gift. Yeah, it might be if you just

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:03.720
aren't getting enough retro consoles. There you go. Guess what? There's probably another one coming

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:09.800
because Liquid Media out of Vancouver just purchased the rights to 65 classic video game

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:15.960
titles, potentially opening the door to revival. So this company Liquid Media has gotten some of

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:20.760
the properties which include Bust to Move. Sadly, not the dancing game. We're talking about Bubble

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:26.040
Bobble because that would be the same franchise. NBA Jam also in this as well. Yeah, that's kind

01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:29.080
of probably the most interesting one that they have. I thought EA would have had the rights to

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:32.520
that. You would think, but I guess for whatever reason, no, maybe it was because it was actually

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:37.160
Midway. EA was maybe you had it for a short time, but they let it lapse because they did

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:41.720
any jam. But now they've got their street thing instead, which is basically NBA Jam. Well, they

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:48.760
had NBA Street beforehand. Yeah. And Street is now part of NBA Live. And then, of course, they did

01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:54.920
NFL Blitz and NBA Jam, but I don't think neither either of those were pretty good. So. So anyway,

01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:59.960
they are making some comments on, you know, basically acquiring this and it's the acquisition

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:03.400
is going to help build the catalog. But what I think is interesting. OK, here's the thing.

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:08.200
So the chairman of Liquid Media Group, the chairman of Liquid Media Group is Joshua Jackson,

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:17.240
the actor from Doss's Creek. Remember? Yes. I did not know that's where he went because I was like,

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:21.080
I haven't seen him. And so what ever happened to that guy? Oh, this is what happened to that guy.

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:26.520
So anyway, you might be interested what he has to say if you want to know what was the name,

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:31.480
Pacey was Pacey's name. Anyway, he said, so many people, myself included,

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:35.880
are returning to the classics. The nostalgia brought on by this resurgence in retro games

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:41.080
connects us to our childhoods and creates incredible demand. So if I had the money to

01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:47.080
buy rights for games, I would buy rates to games. See it. Tiberi wants to remind us.

01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:52.360
Fringe was a very important. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yeah. There you go. Complete forgot he was in

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:57.960
that anyway. Speaking of throwbacks, DDR's 20th anniversary. So last week we had the countdown

01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:03.480
clock. Now we know what it is. It's basically a throwback mode on DDR Ace machines. So what

01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:08.360
happened is that basically they unlocked these new categories. I knew they call. Yeah. What

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:13.320
are they called folders of folders? So there's like a a folder to represent one, two, three,

01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:17.880
four and fifth mix, a folder to represent Max Max to an extreme and a folder represent Supernova and

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:23.560
Supernova two. Uh, and then you have, and I think they have X in there as well to X and X two,

01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:27.800
they do X, X two and X three versus second. Uh, and then I guess technically there is a folder

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:32.920
for 2013 and ACE, which I mean, why not? It's reference. It's all of the other songs, but it's

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:37.720
just okay. But here's the bummer. So it has the folder that represents one, two, three,

01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:41.960
four, and five, obviously like near and dear to my heart, because that was when you and I were

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:47.720
playing DDR like a lot when those was your bed, but it's like two mixes of paranoia,

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:52.280
which that song has played the fuck out trip machine. Brilliant to you, which is cool.

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:57.080
Still in my heart. I mean, it's kinda, it's like, it's nine songs, all this shit. That's

01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:02.600
been on every single mixture. It's basically every now key song and all his pseudonyms.

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:08.680
But then when you get into max, yeah, it's basically every now key song you could ever

01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:14.680
imagine. Uh, and B for you is, uh, in the, these little throwbacks, but it's, it's still cool.

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:19.240
I know I'm being a bitch, but it's really, it's pretty cool that you can go back and play max 300

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:23.960
1998 bag, what they do though. So the style, the classic backgrounds. Yeah. Well,

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:28.360
the styles are different too. So like you pay the first, uh, I think like the second mixed stuff

01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:34.360
or whatever, it actually does it in flat where, you know, everything looked like it did before

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:38.520
the fail screens and the warrant screens are the same. Even in the max mode, they have that

01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:43.240
warning shark thing, which I completely forgot because it's not in, you know, extreme. Um, but

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:46.920
they have those in the backgrounds and stuff. I like the backgrounds better than the dancers,

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:50.840
to be honest. I've seen the dancers in the last few games. That's just some weak shit.

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:57.160
Because we just don't want to create art. So we just, you know, default. I get it.

01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:00.200
They have that in other games too, but orange right in chat says,

01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:02.600
I hope this is still around the next time I go to round one. I have to do,

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:06.840
I'm actually going to be going to round one on Friday because Delvin has never been to one.

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:11.080
So we're going to go over there and Dave and busters too. Oh, that's true. But still,

01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:14.200
we're going to go to round one just cause you know, he's never been. And I want to,

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:21.080
I'll probably, it's been a while. Yeah. I'm going to go on the Bay area at the end of the month,

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:27.720
but, um, I don't think I'm gonna get to round one. All right. Well, good luck. I have a family

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:32.440
in tow. So, you know, Oh, family always getting in the way. All right. Let's, uh, let's check

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:36.520
out some things that maybe Loki can stay home and play, uh, as they are coming out in stores this

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:43.880
week. Yes. So this week we've got, um, starting off with Astro bot rescue mission on PlayStation

01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:50.200
four. We have Batman, the enemy within that's on Nintendo switch four is a horizon four on

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:57.960
windows 10 PC and X-Box one, uh, fist of the North star lost paradise on PlayStation four

01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:06.600
mega man 11 on PC switch PlayStation four and X-Box one, uh, valve theory in arc hero school

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:14.440
story on PC switch and PlayStation four assassins creed odyssey on PC PlayStation four and X-Box one

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:23.000
super Mario party on the switch. And that's it. And actually it was funny. Um, cause I,

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.920
I got kind of scared for a second there when I read super Mario party is not going to be,

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:32.760
it does not work in handheld mode, which I was like, ah, but it's apparently you have,

01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:36.600
you can do it in tabletop mode. You just can't do it with the controllers attached,

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:41.480
which is fucking stupid, but whatever. Oh, it's because isn't it because that whole new thing

01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:45.400
where you put the screens next to each other, like, uh, that's supposed to be a big selling

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:50.040
point for Mario party. But if you play it on TV, you can't do that. So it's, I think it's because

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:54.120
the games require motion controls and it's kind of hard to do that with the screen attached. Okay.

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:58.120
That makes sense though. That'd be my guess. Yeah, no, it makes sense. I was like, ah, crap. I can't

01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:03.160
get it for the kids. Now it's cause the motion, but then I was like, ah, it's fine. All right.

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:07.720
So I'm sure some people will be checking out super Mario party, uh, and, and all new friendships

01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:11.880
thanks to super Mario party. Yes, it might. I will be getting that and probably for a surprise

01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:18.040
before and maybe make a man 11. I don't know. I mean, wait for sale for making male 11.

01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:22.600
All right. Well, let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases there. So

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:27.000
assassin's creed is actually getting a release. Assassin's creed odyssey gets a Japanese release

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.760
the same time we get it. So they're actually getting that a little bit early on October 2nd

01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:34.040
and then their normal release day, which would be the fourth. They get rock man 11,

01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:38.600
which of course is mega man. Uh, they get a game on PlayStation four called Astro bot rescue

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:42.840
mission. And lastly, uh, I think this is a price reduction. I think this game is already out,

01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:49.480
but Senran Kagura Estival versus show Jotachi no Sentaku, which is going into a series called

01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:54.760
best up, which I'm not familiar with, but I think that just means it's, you know, yeah. Cause it's,

01:30:54.760 --> 01:31:00.520
it's like the equivalent of 1999 in Japan. And if you want to know what this game is, it's, uh,

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:07.800
it's everyone knows that Senran Kagura is it's big enemy titties. Is it? Okay. That's all it is.

01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:12.520
I was gonna say they're going to the beach fan service. The game is going to the beach.

01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:16.840
You know where that's going? I mean, I'm sorry. They're ninjas, ninjas.

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:21.880
It's their bikinis all the time. Too gay to know what you're talking about. Sorry.

01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:28.600
Uh, let's go to, and that is literally my excuse. All right. Going to the Nintendo switch.

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:33.960
Rockman 11 is, uh, out of course, as it's on the switch as well as the PlayStation and all that

01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:40.200
we know this week. Um, switch also has a game called Sumiko Gurashi Atsumare Sumiko Town.

01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:44.840
It comes out this week on the switch. Otherwise Rockman would be probably the big release over

01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:50.600
there, uh, on the switch this week. Don't see anything on the 3DS this week. Um, except I guess

01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:57.400
the amiibo figure would work on the 3DS, uh, for Rockman. Um, if you wanted to get trash items and

01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:01.880
games or that, you know how, like, if the amiibo isn't supported in a certain game,

01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:06.120
it'll still give you something trash. It gives you e-tanks. Yeah. Well, no, I'm not even talking

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:10.200
about with making man 11 specific specifically, but like say you're playing breath of the wild

01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:14.120
and you tap an amiibo that has nothing to do with Zelda or any of that. You just get like random

01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:17.320
treasure, right? That's been a while since I've done breath of the wild, but you get random shit,

01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:21.240
basically. So if you want to use your mega man amiibo to get random shit, you can do that. Even

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:27.640
on the 3DS. It is super handy though. And Odyssey to tap bowsers. I could see where the coins are

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:32.280
then missing. Yeah, I know some of the amiibo functionality is neat, but that's about it. All

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:35.880
right. Well, how about the UK? A dark soccer is not here, but can you help us out? UK is getting

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:39.400
pretty much the same stuff we got over here in North America. So fist of the North star

01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:45.160
lost paradise coming out on PlayStation four for the horizon four on PC and Xbox one,

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:51.320
make me 11 on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one, Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:58.200
That's going to be on PlayStation four and Xbox one and PC. And apparently if you order from

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:04.680
game, you get it a few days early, whoopty shit. Astro bought rescue mission on PlayStation four,

01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:12.040
a game called song of memories on the switch and PlayStation four, super Mario party and party on

01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:16.600
the switch. And then they also have these Assassin's Creed Odyssey coming out the regular

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:26.120
time PlayStation four and Xbox one, which is, oh, the early access edition is $30 or 30 pounds more.

01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:30.920
No. Oh boy. I hope it includes all the DLC or something. It's probably, yeah, it's probably

01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:35.000
like a collector's edition or something. Oh, and I'm sorry. There's one more. Uh, we have, uh,

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.680
to be fair, it's the same thing for us is doing for us. It came out a few days. And apparently

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:42.280
they're doing the same thing with other games too. So we have mutant league football dynasty

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:48.600
edition on PlayStation four, Xbox one and the switch and WWE two K 19 early access as well,

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:55.320
which is going to be on PlayStation four, Xbox one PC. Um, that's a week early. This must be

01:33:55.320 --> 01:34:02.440
the new norm. Pay more money for early access quite a bit. Yeah. And it's the 30, 30, 30 pounds

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:06.920
more. All right. Not worth it. Well, I mean, but, well, I mean, but again, like in the case

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:10.680
of Forza, like if you know you're going to get all the DLC, you know, you might as well,

01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:15.160
you know, I, I kind of get it. I just assassin's creed. I don't know if I have that same commitment

01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:19.160
to, this is such a busy week with all these games coming out. Like, you know, fours, uh,

01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:24.040
SAS, this creed, mega man, like super Mario party. This is a huge week, you know, which

01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:27.640
we're getting into that season. It's the first week of October. Here comes the holiday releases.

01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:32.520
We got like call of duty in a few weeks and get ready. All out with 76,

01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:36.440
Red Dead Redemption, all the big year, you know, there's a new Red Dead Redemption thing on Monday

01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:40.120
Yeah. They're supposed to actually show more gameplay. That'd be nice.

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:44.120
They shouldn't have, I don't need to see a ton of gameplay or no, I'm going to get it. So

01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:50.760
all right. That's all good. Let's go to the mailbag because every week you guys send us

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:56.280
emails and we read emails. And if you want to send emails, you should participate at orange

01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:01.800
lounge, radio.com is the place to send us emails. Again, that's participate at orange lounge radio.

01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:07.880
We got two emails this week. First one coming to us from Robert M. Robert M says not much to talk

01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:12.840
about right now. Just wanted to send an email. Uh, I'm probably going to get Jack box party pack

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:18.680
five on switch instead of my old Mac book pro just for easier setup right now. Steam's only showing

01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:22.600
the game for windows and steam box. Well, steam is not going to show it for the consoles because

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:26.360
they want you to buy it on steam, hoping to get more local multiplayer going in general.

01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:30.680
Uh, so he brings up Jack box party pack five, which you haven't really talked a lot about on

01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:34.360
the show, but I didn't realize they had the fifth one coming out. Oh yeah. Yeah, I know. Right.

01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:38.920
It's like now it's become such a, Oh yes. We're used to hearing about a new one every year, but

01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:41.800
this is the year that they're bringing back. You don't know Jack. So that's pretty exciting.

01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:46.280
Oh yeah. Yeah. So, and then I think everything else is new. I think the, the, you don't know

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:49.960
Jack is the only kind of like revival game and everything else is new, but I'll get it because

01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:55.800
those games, God, those games are so easy to just, you know, get a party going. I'm really glad that

01:35:55.800 --> 01:36:00.680
like Jack box kind of like has their MO figured out with these yearly releases and they're doing

01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:04.920
very well and everybody I know plays them. Even people that aren't like super big gamers

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:10.360
because they're like board games basically. Yeah. And so they kind of replace it's nice because

01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:14.600
it's board games without having to have all the board games and without some asshole flipping the

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:18.040
board over in the middle of the game. And also without having to clean off your table to put

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:23.080
the board game on the table because it's decided to dump all their shit on the table as well as

01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:26.680
the rest of the house. So there's no place to play board games anywhere. I feel like this is

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:32.200
turning into a venting session for you. It's just anybody with kids would know. I understand. Anyway,

01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:37.000
continuing with Robert M's email, hopefully this isn't an irresponsibly dumb joke mess,

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:44.200
much less one I've already sent. What is Ryu's favorite music game? Taiko no Tazuuchan,

01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:47.800
I think was how I was supposed to read that. I don't know. Anyway, that's pretty good. Robert

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:51.240
M you probably should have to send a voicemail or something in the future if you want it said

01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:55.000
the way you wanted it said. So there you go. And that was a really dumb joke, but thank you.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:02.040
All right, moving on. Email number two from serial emailer. I feel like I should have like a theme

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:08.040
that goes with this, but we always enjoy hearing from our pal YYR who says, hello, LR. I have to

01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:14.520
agree with act devs call into last week's show. The recently announced PlayStation classic as a

01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:20.440
product just seems unfinished or possibly half-assed. First of all, the fact that only

01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:24.120
five out of the 20 promise games have been announced is kind of like a red flag to me.

01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:28.680
Certainly Sony knows that folks will be lining up to pre-order this thing and that there's no

01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:33.240
need to drip feed game announcements. Why hold them back? Is it because they're not even sure

01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:37.800
yet themselves or are they afraid that the list won't be well received? It's just very strange

01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:42.920
to me that we don't know about the majority of the games yet. I agree with this. Like why drip

01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:47.400
feed this information? Cause it's a tease because then they can do the long, long game with

01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:55.160
advertising. Nintendo is the king of teasing this shit way longer than is necessarily. They didn't

01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:59.240
do this for the classic NES. Yes they did. Did they really? They did. They only announced some

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:02.360
of the games and they announced them later on. They did the same with the SNES classic too.

01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:06.040
I thought we knew them all right out the gate. No, we didn't. We knew about some of them.

01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:11.080
I know with the Switch thing, we only knew half out the gate and then we got the other half later

01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:15.480
on. I'm pretty sure that it wasn't everything to begin with, but at the same time though,

01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:19.640
is this thing targeting this year to come out or is it next year? I can't remember with the

01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:24.680
PlayStation classic. It's this year. Are they trying to target holiday for this? I believe so,

01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:32.520
yeah. I know, right? It's weird. Anyway, secondly in YYRS email, at least one of the five announced

01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:37.160
games is a driving game that takes full advantage of analog controls. However, they're not including

01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:42.360
dual shot controllers in the box. Thank you. Does this mean that they are going to sell them

01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:46.920
separately as upgrades, pushing the final price of this thing even higher? It sounds a bit shady

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:51.240
to me, quite honestly. And since the majority of the later PS1 games use analog controls,

01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:54.840
it makes me wonder if the whole thing is compromised because of it. Third,

01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:59.960
YYRS laundry list of what were the problems of this thing. Sony seems to have missed a home run

01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:05.160
here. They've built an ecosystem that houses literally hundreds of digital PS1 games. Why not

01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:09.960
allow the PlayStation classic to connect to the PlayStation store where you could then download

01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:15.800
any PS1 game you've already bought for no extra charge. Well, think about what you're saying YYR

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.160
and think about what Sony gets away with. And to be fair, what Nintendo gets away with too.

01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:27.640
Or purchase more of them for the normal price of $6 each. Wouldn't this be kind of a no brainer?

01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:32.520
They could even update the firmware to try to slow down hackers, which I suppose would be your

01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:36.360
retort is that the hackers are going to, well, I mean, YYR, I guess that would be the retort

01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:39.480
to the retort. Hackers are going to blow this thing wide open anyway. It doesn't matter.

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:44.920
It's going to happen. There's no way around it. It's probably going to happen much quicker

01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:48.520
because I'm guessing, if anything, they're recycling the emulator from probably another

01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:51.720
system like the PSP or the Vita or something like that. And they're going to adapt it for

01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:55.640
whatever this is. It's got to have enough to onboard storage because if you think about it,

01:39:55.640 --> 01:40:01.000
this is going to hold several disc worse of games. I mean, look at Final Fantasy 7 is three

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:06.520
discs already. And our four was two discs. And I'm trying to think with the other stuff that was

01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:13.000
in there. I know there's other games that are multiple. Lots of games had lots of discs. Yes.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:18.040
So there's lots of storage on this thing. I mean, just to hold all this. The question,

01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:21.800
the answer is, I suppose you're going to be able to play all those games if you're willing to

01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:26.520
resort to the darker side of the Internet, which I am ethically. Are you willing to do that at the

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:30.040
end of the day, though? Is it still worth it to pick it up to do that? I mean, because,

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.600
you know, didn't I kind of say this on last week's show, too? We were talking about this,

01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:41.400
as I said, they really missed an opportunity to just shove Vita TV into this thing. And not that

01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:44.840
I think the Vita TV is, you know, obviously, because we all know how Sony feels about the

01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:49.880
Vita at this point, but you could have had PlayStation now, like you could have Trojan

01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:55.000
horse that thing into this. And, oh, you get all these classic games and push this little button

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.240
here to charge your card. And you can play PlayStation three games and even more than just

01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:04.840
the classics. Push now. Push now. Right. Like, I feel like Sony missed an opportunity or maybe

01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:10.520
they didn't. We're about to find that out. But I just I feel like they sell these games backwards

01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:16.680
compatible for the place. I know. You see the no, because, you know, it's because they've got

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:21.960
a copy Nintendo because look, it was like the top selling console, whatever. But here's the problem.

01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:27.400
Like PlayStation four can't handle PS one games. It can. It can totally handle a PlayStation three

01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:32.760
can handle the PSP can handle it. So this shit can fucking handle. But the problem is like,

01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:41.480
here's the thing. Super Nintendo games and NES games, they look nice when you scale them up on

01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:47.480
TV. And nowadays, you know, they look nice because it's just it wasn't rendering low poly stuff.

01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:55.880
These games don't I don't think are going to be as well received as like those games. And I say,

01:41:55.880 --> 01:42:02.040
I wonder the same thing about the Nintendo 64 classic, which is supposedly still happening,

01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:07.160
because that may not be as fondly received as well, because those, you know, this is for as

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:15.160
blurry as shit. So I'm just worried that it's not going to be as like well received as the

01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:20.520
SNES classic or the NES classic. I think if anything tend to be smarter to go with like a

01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:26.040
Game Boy classic and have it portable or just fucking put the games out on the goddamn platforms

01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:29.960
that you have so we can buy them. All right, calm down. Let me finish. Why is email here? So

01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:35.080
why ends up here? Where did he? They could even update the firmware, try slow down hackers.

01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:38.680
That's where we left off. So I also want to know more about the hardware before I even begin to

01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:43.640
consider preordering the thing. Are the ports on the front USB? If so, can I connect to DualShock

01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:47.800
three or four to them? Can I use the included controllers of the PC? These are all questions

01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:52.040
that could represent either added value or missed opportunities. So yeah, the announcement of the

01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:55.960
PlayStation classic just looks to me like a big bunch of questions. I hope they plan to answer

01:42:55.960 --> 01:43:01.400
some of them before it releases, but you just never know, do you? Have fun YYR. Thank you for

01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:06.920
the email. And honestly, we don't always agree YYR, but I'm with you 100% on this. In fact,

01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:12.120
I think I named some extra things you missed, but you're right. There's the same reason why I didn't

01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:19.800
preorder one. I just, I'm kind of burned out on the classic machines right now. I just, the early

01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:24.600
PlayStation 1 stuff that didn't have DualShock is not like classic, I don't know, classic enough to

01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:30.280
me right now. And like Final Fantasy 7, I think I called out last week as well. I was like, okay,

01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:35.240
enough. Like how many fucking times are going to re-release Final Fantasy 7 when we know this

01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:40.200
remake's on the horizon anyway, right? Didn't we just hear about the Nintendo Switch version and

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:43.480
we were supposed to get excited about that like two weeks ago? And now it's like, oh,

01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:50.120
but it's in the PlayStation classic, like enough. So it's just, I don't know. It's,

01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:57.480
I like R4, but I have it on my PC now. I played it through an emulator and I got to tell you,

01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:01.880
it didn't look very good. I love R4. I think the real question, not look very good. I think the

01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:05.880
real question is going to be, what does this thing look like when the hackers blow it wide open?

01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:11.720
And that's, that's, admit it. That's what you all want to know. That's what you all want to know

01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:17.640
is, you know, and, and to be fair, you know, I realize it's an ethical question because you're

01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:22.040
downloading things you might not have paid for, but at the same time, many of you just want to be

01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:26.200
able to play the PlayStation 1 games that are just collecting dust in your closet on the consoles

01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:31.480
are currently hooked up to your TV. So if you are quote unquote stealing, maybe you're going to be

01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:37.080
doing things you already own and want to play. Does it make sense? It's stupid. It really is.

01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:41.480
Put Buster groove on this thing and I'll change my mind in a heartbeat,

01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:46.760
but I just don't, I just don't see that happening. They're probably going to have wipeout on it,

01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:56.440
but it's just like twisted metal, but Akuma JP in chat, uh, talking about final fantasy seven

01:44:56.440 --> 01:45:01.000
over and over and over again, Akuma JP over at live.vogue.com says, but you get to see

01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:06.680
Aerith die again. Who's complaining? Dark Chakra isn't here. He remasters of this shit. Like give

01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:11.560
me a remaster of our four. I'll buy that shit on the PlayStation four. Give me a remaster of

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:15.240
like what happened to like where they were like, Oh well we can't do PlayStation two games,

01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:19.720
but for some reason we can remaster them quote unquote. It's not really a remaster, but we put

01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:24.840
them in its own emulator. They can't just push a button that says make remaster and it's going

01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:28.920
to happen. Like they have to dedicate people time hours to that. So is it better that they're doing

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.120
stuff like that or working on new things? Like that's what, that's where the questions get

01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:37.480
harder. It's not, it's an emulator. Just you create an emulator that can basically upscale

01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:42.120
this stuff and then you're done. So, so yes, magic button. So yes, magic button because they already

01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:46.840
have this shit on PC. It's been out for PC emulators have been able to do this shit for

01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:55.720
years, decades. All right. I mean, come on. It's, it's ridiculous. Let's move on from that email

01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:59.400
participate at orange launch radio.com. If you want to send us an email for a future week,

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:02.840
we will get to live calls as well in a little bit over at orange launch radio on Skype,

01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:06.040
but we have some more news for you. I don't know if I'd call this first thing news,

01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:13.320
but it's an internet thing. It's where every gamer has a voice and some gamers are using,

01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:18.600
are choosing to use their voices in really ridiculous fucking ways. Right? Loki. Yes.

01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:26.760
So it all began. Let's think back to last week when basically, actually a couple of weeks ago,

01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:35.560
there was a Twitter user, um, by the handle, uh, Hanawa who put out a funny comic strip,

01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:42.680
you know, showing basically the end of super Mario Odyssey, where both Mario and Bowser are

01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:47.800
trying to woo the princess. And she's like, fuck off, you know, like she does in the game.

01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:54.440
And both Mario and Bowser are sad. And then Bowser has this magical crown, which, you know,

01:46:54.440 --> 01:47:01.960
created Peachette in the new, um, remaster of new Super Mario Brothers U because it's not

01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:07.800
Toadette anymore. It's now Peachette and she's become this thing and it magically transformed.

01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:14.040
Well, I'm all for getting rid of Toadette to start. Toadette was lame. Like, sorry, sorry about

01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:18.840
it. But Toadette was always kind of lame. I hated her since Double Dash, which I believe

01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:22.760
was her first appearance. And I hated her in Double Dash. And now every time I see Toadette,

01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:29.640
I'm like, I have an irrational hatred of you. I can't explain. Sorry. So now thanks to this evil,

01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:36.600
this, this crown that apparently has the magical ability to turn whoever wears the crown into some

01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:46.440
fucking waifu anime big breasted chick. Um, so now we have Bowsette, Bowsette, the, the new

01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:53.480
internet hentai rule three, four thing that they're just people are running well with now,

01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:58.920
because not only is it just Bowsette, it's putting it on all the fucking creatures that you can think

01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:06.280
of and turning them into sexy waifu anime chicks and everybody is going fucking bonkers over this

01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:12.120
shit. Um, internet, we need to have a heart to heart talk because I've been using a lot of

01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:15.000
social media this week because I use a lot of social media every week because I'm a social

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.960
media whore, like many of you. Uh, and I'm on Facebook a lot and I'm on Twitter a lot.

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:25.720
And as I've been scrolling this week, I've been seeing this over and over. And not only am I

01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:33.480
seeing this, I'm seeing this turn into more shit like Boozette and, uh, gender swapped Bowsette,

01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:38.120
which you think I wouldn't have a problem with, but yet somehow I do. And internet, I,

01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:44.280
I'm going to need to ask you to knock this off. Like internet, please, please stop. No internet.

01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:53.960
I need to stop it. I am this. Why? This is why old people get upset and yell at you to get off

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:59.640
their lawn because you do things like Bowsette that don't make any sense. Does it not make any

01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:06.200
sense though? Because apparently there is the new art book called the art of super Mario Odyssey,

01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:12.120
which is releasing this week in Japan. And apparently there's concept art of princess

01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:19.320
Bowser straight from Nintendo. So Bowsette cannon question mark. Thanks. I hate it

01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:28.040
because you know, Bowser basically has his own hat, which he can throw on things and it turns

01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:35.240
them into Bowser, uh, over at, uh, our live chat room over at live.vog network.com. Brad from

01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:40.520
pod culture says, where is Robert? Everybody say bye to Brad from pod culture. Who's just

01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:45.960
turned a lifetime ban from the chat room. Say goodbye everybody. It's been very lovely knowing

01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:53.720
him over these past few years. All right. And then already starting fast. Apparently not only

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:59.640
has there been, um, petitions, you know, to include Bowsette into smash, which will never

01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:06.040
fucking happen, but there's going to be a Bowsette fan event being held in Japan on October 27th.

01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:13.720
Gather with all of your fans. If they recently, wait, wait, wait, wait. There's already a

01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:24.680
convention. This just, this just happened a week ago. Pornography is and OJC is very fast.

01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:31.480
What is wrong with you? People spend money on something that makes sense.

01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:40.360
People love put turning in anime objects into anime chicks. I mean, remember before this,

01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:48.600
game consoles, planets. It's it's never going to end. It's never going to end.

01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:59.720
Is that it? That's it for this week for this week. Moving on. Let's talk about something else. Let's

01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:03.880
talk about dragon quest 11. Let's talk about the worst part of dragon quest 11, the soundtrack. Oh

01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:09.640
yeah, I said it. The dragon quest 11 soundtrack. It's kind of stale and, um, I'm glad I'm not the

01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:15.320
only one that thought this because apparently with the dragon quest 11 release on PC,

01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:20.760
good old hackers and modders have decided to fix some of the problems of the music in the game.

01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:27.400
Mainly they took the mini instruments, uh, and replace them with orchestra music. That's right.

01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:32.360
It's dragon quest 11 orchestration overhaul mod. It was finished just over the weekend

01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:38.120
and it replaces all the music with an orchestrated rendition. So it sounds a little more like, uh,

01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:43.480
dragon quest eight, I suppose. Now you do have to have copies of the dragon quest 11 soundtrack

01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:48.680
as performed by the Tokyo metropolitan symphony orchestra. So I guess they wanted to keep this

01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:52.760
legit. So you do have to own those sound, but I'm sure you could find those soundtracks if you

01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:58.680
wanted to be a very bad person, but it's such a way to do it. But anyway, they do say the goal

01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:03.160
of this mod is to provide the proper auditory experience that is deserving of this masterpiece

01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:07.800
of a game by applying all available orchestral variants of the songs present in the game

01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:12.520
as composed by Kochi Sugiyama and performed by the Tokyo metropolitan symphony orchestra.

01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:17.000
We do not contain or support piracy in any way, shape or form, and we will not provide the raw

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:21.400
music files for listening. I'm sure someone else will. So if you want that, you'll have to buy the

01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:25.400
official symphonic suite albums. That being said, I want to follow up with something I was getting

01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:29.400
into on Bobby Black Wolf show, and this will not make me popular, but I don't care because I'm

01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:33.240
going to say what I'm going to say. And what I'm going to say is it is time for dragon quest to let

01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:40.280
Sugiyama go. Dragon Quest XI was a flop as far as the soundtrack is concerned, and it just shows

01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:45.800
that he cannot get past these same themes that have been going on for the past 10 games now.

01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:51.400
I mean, part of my hatred could be fueled by his politics because he's an anti-gay guy if you

01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:54.920
watch him on the television in Japan and stuff, and so maybe there's a little bit of that coming

01:52:54.920 --> 01:53:00.840
into play. But honestly, play Dragon Quest XI, which for all purposes outside of the soundtrack

01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:06.520
is a great game. Play it on PlayStation 4 and load up Spotify and, I don't know, listen to Robin

01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:09.480
or something. It's probably going to take you out of the experience a little bit, but it's going to

01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:13.640
be better than the original soundtrack. Play the game and tell me the soundtrack isn't terrible.

01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:20.120
A downgrade from VIII, which was, unless you played it on 3DS, if you played Dragon Quest VIII

01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:25.400
on the PlayStation 2, it was that full orchestral experience. And so playing Dragon Quest XI

01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:29.880
honestly feels like a step backwards. And again, I said a little bit of this on Bobby's show at the

01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:36.200
tail end when he called us, but Final Fantasy has moved on past Nobuo Uematsu. These are very

01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:41.000
different scenarios, and I do not mean to speak ill of Nobuo Uematsu, especially coming off of

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:46.200
last week's Newsies, taking a break because he's sick. But as we know, he decided to move on from

01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:50.040
the Final Fantasy series. Well, he still comes back to do, you know, like he does the theme or

01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:54.360
he'll do one or two compositions every soundtrack, but he went on to do other games and other things

01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:58.680
like Lost Odyssey, you know, other projects, things like that. Which we still need a sequel for.

01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:05.720
That is true, but this is different. But my point is, Final Fantasy has still done fine with

01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:11.720
different composers. Most notably, in my opinion, Final Fantasy XIV. If you fucking hate online

01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:16.840
games, you still need to check out the soundtrack, if nothing else. Seriously, go look up some of the

01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:22.920
songs from Final Fantasy XIV soundtrack, the new, the post Realm Reborn stuff by a guy named Soken.

01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:30.200
It's probably the best music in the entire series, honestly. Now, to be fair, and I don't, again,

01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:35.640
I don't want to speak ill of Uematsu, but a lot of the reason why XIV soundtrack is good is that

01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:40.920
he takes elements of Uematsu's themes from the earlier games and really pushes them to the next

01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:48.520
level. Like, I love the Stormblood opening title screen, which takes the Final Fantasy theme,

01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:52.920
which Nobui Uematsu did, and puts like a pirate theme on it. It's awesome. It's a great, like,

01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:58.440
it's very well done. So anyway, my point is, and XIII had a different composer, XV had a different

01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:03.880
composer, and all the soundtracks since, I believe, he did part of the XI soundtrack,

01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:09.480
and that was the last thing Nobui Uematsu did the full thing for. They've been fine. Dragon Quest

01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:17.320
will be fine too. Let Sugiyama go and let somebody else do the soundtrack. That is my opinion,

01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:22.120
whether you like it or not. How about your opinions over at live.vognetwork.com?

01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:26.600
Dungeon Buster says, yeah, the Dragon Quest XI soundtrack is kind of stale. I found myself wishing

01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:31.320
for more of Octopath Traveler's soundtrack while playing. Ooh, that's a really good call out too,

01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:35.880
is that Square has other franchises with other composers that are very talented as well. It's

01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:41.400
very, very good point. DarkTusia says, I do hope it's addressed on the Switch version. I know they

01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:45.240
usually add things to a new port, like voice acting, so maybe they'll have room for a better

01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:49.960
soundtrack. Let's hope. Bob Coffee says, the reason why Dragon Quest has the shitty MIDI

01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:55.240
is because Sugiyama is an asshole and wants people to pay for concert or orchestral CDs.

01:55:55.240 --> 01:56:02.360
Bob Coffee, this is the justification to fire him, in my opinion. Let him go. Somebody else can take

01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:08.200
over this and can still incorporate the old shit into it, I'm sure, with the appropriate level of

01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:14.040
throwback and so on and so on. So it'll be fine. Dungeon Buster says, Final Fantasy XII,

01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:19.880
Hitoshi Sakamoto, who did the music for Tactics and Valkyria Chronicles. Yep, amazing stuff.

01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:26.520
So there you go. My opinion on Dragon Quest XI, and clearly I'm not alone, not just you guys in

01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:30.680
chat, but these modders that are like, what they put in the game is not good enough. It's really

01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:37.320
not. Otherwise Dragon Quest, I mean, you know, and the soundtrack is, it's, it's just, it's just

01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:41.640
not as good as it was me. It felt like regression. That's the most frustrating part about it,

01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:45.320
considering, you know, Dragon Quest VIII was on the PlayStation fucking 2, and this is on the

01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:50.760
PlayStation 4, to have the, everything else feels like progression. To have this feel like regression

01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:59.640
is, is really stupid. Anyway, but hackers fixed it. Yay. Loki, let's move on to another story.

01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:06.200
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:15.080
use the passphrase, heat. So this week, we had the Oculus event that was in San Jose,

01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:24.440
and they announced the new Oculus platform called the Oculus Quest. It is a standalone VR headset.

01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:29.480
You will not need a PC for this. It's basically going to be its own console. And with that,

01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:37.000
it has a resolution of 1600 by 1440 per eye. It's going to come with a couple of the Oculus

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:41.560
Touch controllers, and it's going to have some sort of motion tracking in there as well.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:48.200
I don't think it's got the actual sensors, like the normal Oculus Rift does, but it's kind of

01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:54.280
like, it works in the reverse, basically the actual positioning track, positional tracking

01:57:54.280 --> 01:58:00.360
will be done by the headset itself. It's supposed to retail for $400 for a 64 gigabyte model,

01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:03.720
and they said that about 50 games will be supported at release. It's supposed to come

01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:08.840
out in spring of 2019. Looks neat. I'm not sure if this would be something that I'm going to pick

01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:16.920
up because I don't need another console, but that's definitely a good price point to, you know,

01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:21.560
hopefully get people interested in VR stuff. Especially, I'd like to see other things this

01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:26.920
could be used for, aside from just some of the games and everything. I always wanted like the

01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:34.360
AR stuff with, you know, virtual desktop things and stuff, but I'm curious to see what's going

01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:39.480
to be on the platform. Maybe see if this is gonna be like a major contender against like other

01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:43.640
consoles or something. I just think with PlayStation VR being so easily accessible,

01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:48.680
I just don't see Oculus, at least in the gaming space, really taking that crown. But, you know,

01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:52.360
again, I think VR is still trying to find where the niche can be for everything else,

01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:56.680
and that's a big part of the reason why Facebook wanted Oculus in the first place is, you know,

01:58:57.320 --> 01:59:01.720
how could I maybe be like, how could Facebook bring a live concert experience and you could

01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:06.840
sit there in your Oculus and really feel like you're there. But I just feel like we're not

01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:11.800
seeing enough of that for like the common person right now. Right, and I agree with that, but also,

01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:15.240
you know, with the PlayStation VR, though, you have to buy the console, which is, you know,

01:59:15.320 --> 01:59:20.920
almost $400, and then you have to buy the headset, which is also, you know, pretty expensive.

01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:25.720
Our pal Bobby in our chat, and you know he loves his VR, over at live.fognetwork.com says,

01:59:25.720 --> 01:59:30.120
the tracking here is way better than PSVR's and is ultimately cheaper, or maybe even the same price.

01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:35.640
Oculus venues already exist for Gear VR and Oculus Go, which is that concert thing. But like,

01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:42.040
I get all that. I really do. But A, I mean, the price and the technology ain't gonna matter when

01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:47.000
it comes down to the applications. And let's just put it this way, PlayStation VR has Tetris Effect

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:54.600
coming out. But this Oculus Star Wars. Okay, well, okay, so then this is where now they're trying to

01:59:54.600 --> 02:00:03.800
so they have a Darth Vader game coming to Oculus quest called Vader Immortal. And it looks neat.

02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:12.520
It's gonna be an episodic game, and apparently it says that you're playing as some person that

02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:18.040
gets kidnapped by Darth Vader, and I don't know, you're also like some apprentice or something.

02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:24.280
Neat. So you get to be the bad, you're Darth Vader's apprentice? You get to be a bad guy?

02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:31.160
I guess so, yeah. But maybe you're just not a bad guy. I don't know, but it's a neat idea, and that's

02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:37.880
definitely a good selling point. Okay, so this is not going to be fair, but it's where my head goes.

02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:42.920
Because I go, well, everyone got real excited when they announced a Star Wars game for Kinect.

02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:52.280
Look how that turned out. Not good. So, right, but let's be honest, the Kinect motion tracking

02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:57.880
versus the motion tracking. Loki, my issues have nothing to do with how the tracking. No,

02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:01.400
I understand. It's a stupid dance. It's like, well, we gotta pad this game out. Like, hey,

02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:07.560
let's get the team behind Dance Central to make some content for it. And don't get me wrong,

02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:12.360
they did the best that they could with what they had. I'm not faulting them because those songs,

02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:18.760
as stupid as they are, it's still catchy. I'm hand solo. It's catchy, but you know what? So bad.

02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:23.960
They did, it was not there. They were just following orders. No, they weren't, they were.

02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:29.160
They were just doing what they needed to do to get paycheck. Some executive made a really poor

02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:34.040
choice to do that, but I don't know. All right, well, I have to piggyback off that because

02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:38.280
guess what? You want to talk about more exec decisions, things that were completely out of

02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:43.640
the hands of the developers. You ready for this? Here's the development. Now you can get the,

02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:48.920
I would say it's DLC basically, but it's not. It's just a weapon. So you can get a weapon in

02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:52.680
Assassin's Creed Odyssey. So like, you know, put in a little code and get a weapon, right?

02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:57.320
And you would expect, oh, a pre-order bonus or, oh, buying this at Best Buy. That's what we're

02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:01.000
used to, to getting the special weapons and armor, right? Oh no, no, no, no. This one's really good.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:07.160
So the way that you get this weapon is that you will get the code with Totino's pizza rolls.

02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:14.040
That's right. You, or the, the, not that, they don't just do the pizza rolls. They do that

02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:18.840
shitty like cracker pizza. That's like probably like a buck at Winco. That's, that's them too,

02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:25.960
right? I don't know. We see those in college all the time. But anyway, so you, you can get a code

02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:30.360
for Assassin's Creed Odyssey to get a special weapon for a limited time to get bonus in-game

02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:36.440
items for the upcoming Ubisoft title. This deal is only good in the US. Sorry to everybody else

02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:42.840
in other countries, but no pizza rolls for you. You can also get things like temporary XP boosts,

02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:48.760
weapons. I guess the first code gets an XP boost. The second gets a Horn of Ares sickle sword,

02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:53.960
and the third gets you a Bighorn bow. Every- You have to have like 12, I think, to get everything.

02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:59.320
Well, cause you get XP boosts after that for everything else. And, and, you ready for this?

02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:06.280
If you get them at Walmart, you get an additional bonus. That's right. You get the Ram Axe if...

02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:15.880
I can't help, this is so stupid. You get the Ram Axe if you buy the only at Walmart,

02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:21.000
120 count pizza rolls pack. Got all of those pizza rolls.

02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:26.360
You know, they did this last year with Totino's had a-

02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:31.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Brad from Pod Culture in chat. This needs to be, this needs to be responded to.

02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:36.680
Says, shut your whore mouth, pizza rolls are awesome. When did I say pizza rolls aren't

02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:43.000
awesome? Pizza rolls are fucking amazing. But still, there's something about the whole,

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:48.280
you gotta buy, you don't just have to buy a little box. You have to put 120 count pizza rolls box,

02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:55.640
enough to feed an Assassin's Creed Odyssey army in order to get the Ram Axe.

02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:57.320
Apparently I'm not trying hard enough.

02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:07.240
Pizza rolls are better than gender rolls. I will, uh, I will say that.

02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:11.800
Because like the word Assassin, pizza rolls will make your ass twice as big.

02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:19.800
Are you ready to put the ass in Assassin's? We'll get that 120 count pack of pizza rolls.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:24.760
They did this last year Shadow of War 2, and it was just as ridiculous then.

02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:31.320
But remember, they need all the money. They're hurting. They can't make AAA games anymore

02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:38.440
because they're not selling enough Super Ultimate Editions and pizza roll tie-ins and other nonsense.

02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:44.520
All right. Admit it, Loki. Are you going to pick up the new Assassin's Creed? I don't like

02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:48.760
Assassin's Creed. Well, this new one looks really good. I might pick it up. And you know what,

02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:51.720
bitch? I might pick up some pizza rolls because pizza rolls are pretty good.

02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:55.800
You're part of the problem, Rob. I can't help it.

02:04:58.040 --> 02:05:00.680
Anyway, just a few more stories for you guys. Then we're going to open up the

02:05:00.680 --> 02:05:04.040
Skypline at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. Loki.

02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:07.240
So of course, since Battle Royale has to come to all the things,

02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:11.640
what thing's going to get Battle Royale next? Well, it's going to be Doom.

02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:14.840
And I'm not talking about new Doom. I'm talking about old Doom, classic Doom.

02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:23.000
The Doom you remember as a child called Doom Royale with Cheese. And it's a mod that'll let

02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:30.120
64 players fight to the death using the double-barreled shotgun.

02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:33.240
And of course, just like PUBG and Fortnite, there's the shrinking

02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:41.240
play field. They have ammo weapon scavenging. And of course, you have to be the last man standing.

02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:46.760
So neat. You can find that over at ModDB if you're interested in checking it out.

02:05:48.760 --> 02:05:50.840
It sounds kind of awesome, though. It's neat.

02:05:50.840 --> 02:05:53.720
Yeah. No, I play Doom Battle Royale. It sounds like fun.

02:05:53.720 --> 02:05:59.160
Yeah. Yeah. All right. And last but not least tonight, before we open up the Skypline,

02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:02.920
let's talk about, you know, since all these classic systems are happening,

02:06:02.920 --> 02:06:07.160
you know, somebody on the internet had to say CDI classic when.

02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:15.320
So, oh, no, no. So somebody made a Photoshop user. I don't know if this guy actually made it,

02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:19.160
but he made the tweet. Skully1888 tweeted at Philips with,

02:06:19.160 --> 02:06:23.720
Philips CDI classics, 20 classic games, including Hotel Mario,

02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:28.280
Zelda, The Wand of Gamelon, Link, The Faces of Evil, The Seventh Guest,

02:06:28.280 --> 02:06:33.960
Playboy's Complete Massage, and Mad Dog McCree, as well as Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia.

02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:39.160
Okay. Like out of that list, The Seventh Guest is probably the only notable game.

02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:40.840
It's not very notable.

02:06:40.840 --> 02:06:44.360
Mad Dog McCree, I know they released a ton of times, but it's not very good.

02:06:44.360 --> 02:06:47.160
Seventh Guest they've re-released several times. Not very good.

02:06:47.160 --> 02:06:50.680
It didn't age well. That's a problem. Anyway, here's the crazy part.

02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:55.560
Philips replied saying, thank you very much for reminding us of the Philips CDI.

02:06:55.560 --> 02:06:59.320
We appreciate the thought of a smaller classic version of one of our legacy devices.

02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:03.000
And then somebody was like, you would make the buzz if you did it.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:04.920
And Philips responded, thank you for your love.

02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:08.200
And there's such a positive fucking person working in this Twitter account.

02:07:09.240 --> 02:07:11.560
Hi, thank you for your love, encouragement, and interest.

02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:15.400
We will try our best to fulfill your dreams and release something you suggest,

02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:19.400
but cannot promise anything yet. Please be patient and stay tuned.

02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:20.680
Thank you in advance.

02:07:20.680 --> 02:07:24.360
Okay. This isn't going to fucking happen. Like, I don't know where,

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:28.280
I don't know where this joke, first off those Nintendo licenses,

02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:31.800
Nintendo would rather you stop talking about those games.

02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:36.600
Nintendo would really rather you stop talking about Hotel Mario and Zelda the Wand again.

02:07:36.600 --> 02:07:40.920
They'll put Balzette in Smash before they put this out.

02:07:40.920 --> 02:07:42.680
I mean, this is never going to fucking happen.

02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:49.160
Now that's not to say that Philips couldn't still put something out with the Seventh Guest

02:07:49.160 --> 02:07:54.200
and Mad Dog McCree, but like, I mean, if you don't think the PlayStation

02:07:54.760 --> 02:08:00.360
classic lineup sounds very good so far, the Philips CDI lineup, not going to be good.

02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:06.360
Now, I guess they could always do maybe like homebrew or something.

02:08:06.360 --> 02:08:10.600
I don't know, but I just, I just, just let it go.

02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:11.720
No, let it go.

02:08:11.720 --> 02:08:12.440
Please don't.

02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:19.560
The Philips CDI is best left as that, that thing that some guy has at a booth at a classic gaming

02:08:19.560 --> 02:08:25.560
expo that you look at and you pick it up and you play Zelda Wanda Gamelon for five minutes ago.

02:08:25.560 --> 02:08:26.200
What the fuck?

02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:28.920
Wow. This really was a shit game.

02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:32.200
And then you go on with the rest of your day.

02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:37.080
So now that we've gotten these two consoles out of the way, uh, anybody hitting up, uh,

02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:41.960
Panasonic for the 3DO Mini or the, or Sega for the Saturn Mini?

02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:43.320
Where's my Jaguar Mini?

02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:47.880
Let's play Aliens First Predator and Tempest 2000.

02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:49.240
You want your Jaguar Mini?

02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:49.400
Yeah.

02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:50.040
It's coming out.

02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:52.440
It's called the fucking new Atari system that they have.

02:08:53.720 --> 02:08:55.320
That's your Jaguar Mini right there.

02:08:56.840 --> 02:08:57.340
All right.

02:08:58.120 --> 02:08:59.320
We're going to open up the Skypline.

02:08:59.320 --> 02:08:59.880
It's that time.

02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:01.960
So Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:05.080
If you want to give us a call about something we've talked about so far, or maybe something

02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:08.120
we haven't, but, um, I know there's a lot of news stories we didn't get to.

02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:08.840
Yes.

02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:10.920
This is important news that we have to get to.

02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:11.080
Okay.

02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:12.760
So tell me some of the stuff we missed here.

02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:14.440
Just talking about Assassin's Creed.

02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:18.040
And of course in Assassin's Creed, there is a giant statue of Zeus.

02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:21.240
And what can you do with this giant statue of Zeus?

02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:24.680
You can climb on its penis because it's Assassin's Creed.

02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:27.080
And of course you can do that shit.

02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:27.720
So why not?

02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:30.600
It's very important news.

02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:33.240
Can I put a pizza roll on his penis?

02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:34.840
No, you may not.

02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:36.120
Why not?

02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:41.960
Sony is ending support for certain online games, including Warhawk, Twisted Metal,

02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:43.880
PlayStation All-Stars, Battle Royale.

02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:47.960
That's going to be ending on October 25th, 2018.

02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:49.560
I'm surprised they hadn't already pulled the plug.

02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:54.360
And Drawn to Death, David Jaffe's game is going to be out.

02:09:54.360 --> 02:09:57.960
That came out a long time ago as one of the PlayStation plus titles, and it's going to

02:09:57.960 --> 02:09:59.800
be ending March 25th, 2019.

02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:03.000
So play it while you can.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:04.520
I think it's free to play.

02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:09.000
Yeah, it was free to play on PlayStation Plus, but I think they still charge 20 bucks for

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:09.080
it.

02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:12.520
Speaking of PlayStation Plus, for October, we're going to be getting Friday the 13th

02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:14.680
and Laser League, which Laser League is just like Tron.

02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:15.560
So check it out.

02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:19.960
PlayStation 3 is getting Master Reboot and The Bridge, which is cross by PlayStation

02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:21.240
4 and Vita.

02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:25.800
PlayStation Vita is cross by PlayStation 4, RocketBirds 2 Evolution and 2064 Read Only

02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:26.280
Memories.

02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:27.320
So that's pretty awesome.

02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:27.880
Neat.

02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:33.720
Um, on the Xbox front, Games of Gold, you're going to be getting Overcooked for the month

02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:38.200
of October and Victor Vran from the middle of October to the 15th.

02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:38.520
All right.

02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:40.760
Let's get to the phones real quick and then we'll get back to Loki.

02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:41.880
Hi, you're on Orange Mountain Radio.

02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:42.760
Who's this?

02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:43.720
Hey, this is Def.

02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:44.680
Hey Def, how you doing?

02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:49.800
Well, I have a Pokemon Go story that happened today.

02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:51.160
I love Pokemon Go stories.

02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:53.800
Is this about the day that you hit BFF status with me?

02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:55.000
Because I'm sure it was a great day.

02:10:56.040 --> 02:10:56.920
No, it was a great day.

02:10:56.920 --> 02:10:59.080
But no, I'm talking about specifically today.

02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:07.400
And it's something that we sometimes joke about in the whole community that when bad

02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:12.680
weather's in the city, you probably shouldn't go out and play.

02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:22.120
Well, there's a tropical storm happening right now in my city, but right now it's like really

02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:25.560
calm that it was cloudy earlier and all.

02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:32.280
But we had a Mewtwo raid near my house, so I decided to go.

02:11:33.240 --> 02:11:39.480
I didn't notice until I was out and I was heading my way to that raid that we had a

02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:40.040
thunderstorm.

02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:45.320
I didn't pay that much attention and I said, oh, that seems like it's far away.

02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:48.040
Nothing bad will happen.

02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:52.120
You did the same thing we always do with the alert that comes up in Pokemon Go.

02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:53.160
There's a severe weather.

02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:53.800
Yeah, who cares?

02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:56.200
Click or just like I'm a passenger.

02:11:56.200 --> 02:11:56.840
Yeah, sure I am.

02:11:57.480 --> 02:12:05.400
Here's the thing that the weather in Pokemon Go at the moment was sunny because because

02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:06.360
of course it was.

02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:08.360
It always is.

02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:09.000
And we had that.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.160
We had it the other day, too, is like weather warning.

02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:12.840
It's like weather warning.

02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:14.120
There's clouds in the sky.

02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:15.480
I don't even know what that warning was for.

02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:17.240
Maybe a fire is a fire alert or something.

02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:17.720
Maybe.

02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:18.120
I don't know.

02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:18.520
Who knows?

02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:21.400
I want to know the rest of the story because it sounds like danger is involved.

02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:26.200
Yeah, but yeah, it actually looks like like partially cloudy.

02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:30.440
But yeah, it was really cloudy and thunder was happening happening.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:35.720
And we I happened to to get there to the raid and people were waiting.

02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:43.640
And and yeah, the thunder was still coming out, but it was like far.

02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:44.920
OK.

02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:48.920
When suddenly we were going to we're we're preparing for the raid and all.

02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:52.680
And suddenly we heard like a boom.

02:12:54.520 --> 02:13:03.000
And yeah, there was a big flash there and and I just like I was I started like, well,

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:03.640
it happened here.

02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:04.200
It happened here.

02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:06.360
It happened near near near us.

02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:07.960
And I was kind of panicking.

02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:16.920
And then I noticed that like 15 meters, like, I don't know, the conversion by 20 feet, maybe

02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:22.520
they'll know that a tree that was near was destroyed.

02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:24.440
Oh, my God.

02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:29.400
So you went out to catch a Mewtwo and a tree right next to you got hit by lightning.

02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:30.920
Basically.

02:13:30.920 --> 02:13:35.480
And but people there were more people there that were way near.

02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:37.320
But act out.

02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:38.440
Did you catch the Mewtwo?

02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:44.360
Sadly, sadly, because people were panicked.

02:13:44.360 --> 02:13:46.040
They were panicking.

02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:48.920
We only had like a few people there.

02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:54.440
And we had like two groups and my group didn't finish the raid.

02:13:55.720 --> 02:13:57.160
We couldn't catch it.

02:13:58.680 --> 02:13:59.480
He did all that.

02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:01.640
You almost got killed by lightning and they didn't.

02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:03.240
You couldn't even catch the damn Mewtwo.

02:14:04.040 --> 02:14:06.600
But that's that's the least of my worries.

02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:10.280
No, you know, I had to make fun of made fun of it somehow.

02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:12.600
But that's that's crazy that it was like so.

02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:13.160
Oh, my God.

02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:14.040
Like, that's scary.

02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:17.400
I thought this was going to be that like lightning hit the pokey stop and lightning

02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:21.560
destroyed the pokey stop when pokey stops are so rare in Mexico to begin with.

02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:28.120
Yeah, the pokey stop, the little the little thing was next to that tree.

02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:32.680
So, yeah, good thing it didn't start a fire and burned down the pokes.

02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:33.720
I shouldn't make fun of it.

02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:35.160
Could you use Thunderbolt?

02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:36.200
It was very effective.

02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:45.000
Loki, people caught Mewtwo in that raid with with thunder, with the thunder attack.

02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:50.040
So, yeah, you should you should remember that for next time to yell that out.

02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:51.240
Pikachu used Thunderbolt.

02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:52.280
It's super effective.

02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:53.080
That's that's good.

02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:53.960
I like that, Loki.

02:14:55.400 --> 02:14:59.560
Oh, but everyone was fine.

02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:02.120
Uh, someone did that.

02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:06.040
They'd get hit by the tree, but nothing too serious.

02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:08.520
Just like a scrap or something.

02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:09.020
Oh, my God.

02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:10.600
Sudowoodo.

02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:11.640
No, I'm just kidding.

02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:11.880
I'm sorry.

02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:12.520
I can't help it.

02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:16.680
No, we're all in the community locally here.

02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:18.360
We're joking about it and all.

02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:24.280
And again, it was like it was a complete like terrifying.

02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:29.160
But at the at the same moment, like really exciting moment, because, oh, my God, it

02:15:29.240 --> 02:15:29.560
happened.

02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:30.120
That happened.

02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:31.720
So, you know what?

02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:35.000
And danger is fun to flirt with once in a while.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:38.520
That was that was like thrill seeking Pokemon adventures.

02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:40.360
Soon you're going to be the star of a documentary.

02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:43.560
But instead of like storm chasers, it's going to be Mewtwo chasers.

02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:46.360
Pokemon raid chasers.

02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:47.240
Yeah, chasers.

02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:47.800
Oh, my God.

02:15:47.800 --> 02:15:49.000
I'm screaming.

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:53.800
Well, I know we're only sitting here making jokes because you're OK and everybody else

02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:55.800
is OK, except whoever got hit by the tree.

02:15:55.800 --> 02:15:57.720
But it sounds like it was a little more superficial.

02:15:57.720 --> 02:15:59.560
Like it wasn't a big branch or something.

02:15:59.560 --> 02:15:59.800
Right.

02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:00.520
Sounds like they're OK.

02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:01.480
Yeah.

02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:05.240
Everybody got the they're fine.

02:16:05.240 --> 02:16:06.040
Nobody got hurt.

02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:12.360
So I'm really glad about that, because if someone had gotten hurt or even gotten hit

02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:17.080
by the lightning, it would have been like like really terrifying.

02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:19.080
Like and again, it was terrifying.

02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:22.520
But since nothing happened, basically.

02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:23.880
Yeah, we're laughing.

02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:26.040
And yeah, the tree and all that stuff.

02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:27.960
But yeah, it's something serious that happened.

02:16:28.600 --> 02:16:34.600
I don't know what I would have done like seriously, because it was like at that moment.

02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:40.920
And I still have the image basically ingrained in my in my head, in my mind right now of

02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:42.040
the flash.

02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:46.200
I literally saw that flash, the lightning flash that that hit the tree.

02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:49.160
And it was really like something.

02:16:49.960 --> 02:16:53.400
You know, it also goes to show that those warnings that they put at the beginning of

02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:54.600
the game, like they're no joke.

02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:56.040
Like you have to really pay attention.

02:16:56.040 --> 02:17:00.600
And, you know, I hate to be a downer, but I think it's it's worth saying, like, you

02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:03.720
know, I know in the Ingress community, like there was a player in Europe who actually

02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:08.760
died because they were not paying attention and they essentially walked off a cliff.

02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:11.400
Like and I know that sounds ridiculous as I'm saying it out loud and you're probably

02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:11.880
going like what?

02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:13.800
But like, you know, they just weren't paid.

02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:14.600
I think it was at night.

02:17:14.600 --> 02:17:16.120
So it's kind of dangerous as well.

02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:18.280
And they were, you know, trying to take down a big field or something.

02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:18.600
I don't know.

02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:19.960
They basically like fell off a cliff.

02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:21.720
I think it was like wet outside or something.

02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:25.560
So like, you know, they're luckily active is OK and everybody's OK.

02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:27.640
So we can we can poke fun and laugh at it.

02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:30.280
But there is a very serious, you know, note here.

02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:32.600
And that is like, you know, those warnings do exist for a reason.

02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:36.200
You do want to be aware when you're playing these games, because even though we're talking

02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:39.480
about like natural weather and these, you know, freak things like you don't want to,

02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:43.480
like, get hit by a car because you cross the street, you know, that type of thing like

02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:44.920
that is serious as well, you know?

02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:52.200
Yeah, that this basically made me right about the game and and how I should approach it,

02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:58.120
because again, like at the beginning of the story, like I said, I was like and nothing

02:17:58.120 --> 02:17:58.840
bad will happen.

02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:01.960
And literally that happened like, whoa.

02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:08.840
And so, yeah, the story is basically just for people that play like Ingress, Pokemon

02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:11.320
Go, all this kind of games.

02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:12.280
Just be careful out there.

02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:18.600
It we can sometimes think that nothing bad will happen and then it happens.

02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:21.000
So so basically that just stay aware.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:21.640
For sure.

02:18:21.640 --> 02:18:22.200
For sure.

02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:26.440
And Act F for next time, make sure you train a Golem and get them on your team because

02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:28.520
the Golem will absorb the Thunderbolt for next time.

02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:30.120
I will.

02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:30.680
All right.

02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:31.400
Thank you for the call.

02:18:31.400 --> 02:18:32.520
Act F and happy hunting.

02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:33.020
Take care.

02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:34.360
Hey, thanks for having me.

02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:34.840
Yeah, no problem.

02:18:34.840 --> 02:18:35.480
Thanks for the story.

02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:36.040
It was really good.

02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:36.540
Bye.

02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:37.660
Wow.

02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:38.360
Yeah.

02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:38.840
Oh my gosh.

02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:39.320
I can't imagine.

02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:40.120
Oh, I've never.

02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:42.040
Have you ever had lightning hit that close to you?

02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:44.440
Like I've never had the storms up.

02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:48.120
Well, also we don't like get tropical storms here in the Sacramento, you know, Northern

02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:48.760
California.

02:18:48.760 --> 02:18:52.040
We have a very unique kind of weather pattern because we don't really get those same type

02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:52.600
of things.

02:18:52.600 --> 02:18:56.280
I think we're supposed to be getting rain finally on like Tuesday or Wednesday in the

02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:58.120
distance, maybe even tonight.

02:18:58.120 --> 02:19:03.000
I wonder if it's the remnants of this trouble because, you know, Act F is, I believe in

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:08.040
Mexicali, if I remember right, which is kind of like it's it's basically south of California,

02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:10.200
but it's not like Tijuana is way on the west.

02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:13.640
It's a little more eastern than that, you know, and it's kind of south.

02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:17.400
So, um, I wonder if the storm is big enough where we're getting like remnants of it

02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:17.960
up here.

02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:18.460
Maybe.

02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:19.320
Yeah.

02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:21.640
Well, be careful if there's thunder attached to that.

02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:23.640
Sounds, uh, it sounds like it could be dangerous.

02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:24.040
Anyway.

02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:27.320
Um, you were talking about, uh, the PlayStation games.

02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:27.640
Yeah.

02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:29.560
For, uh, PlayStation plus.

02:19:29.560 --> 02:19:29.880
Yes.

02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:30.600
Orange launch radio.

02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:31.400
All one word on Skype.

02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:31.800
If you want to get.

02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:36.840
So Xbox, um, I mentioned Overcooked and Victor Brown and then on the Xbox 360 compatible

02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:41.240
games, Stuntman Ignition and Hitman Blood Money will be October's games.

02:19:42.120 --> 02:19:47.960
Um, Nintendo has won a lawsuit against some Tokyo company that runs a service called,

02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:55.080
um, Maricar, which is, uh, basically tours through Tokyo in go-karts dressed up like

02:19:55.080 --> 02:19:57.720
Mario Kart characters, which sounds awesome.

02:19:57.720 --> 02:20:03.240
And, uh, so they are going to stop doing that because they, you know, filed, um, are fine

02:20:03.240 --> 02:20:04.120
against them.

02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:06.360
But to get your Mario Kart experience.

02:20:06.360 --> 02:20:11.240
So the Nam Bandai Man Namco is going to be bringing over Mario Kart VR to the U S pretty

02:20:11.240 --> 02:20:11.560
soon.

02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:12.120
Oh, cool.

02:20:12.120 --> 02:20:14.040
I'm starting in Washington, DC.

02:20:14.040 --> 02:20:16.840
It's coming to their VR zone.

02:20:16.840 --> 02:20:18.760
Um, it's like an arcade thing.

02:20:18.760 --> 02:20:19.240
Yes.

02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:20.440
Have you ever been down to that?

02:20:20.440 --> 02:20:23.880
Um, I always want to call it punch trunk, but this is punch bowl social.

02:20:23.880 --> 02:20:26.200
Have you been to that place that it's by the new arena?

02:20:26.200 --> 02:20:31.720
So they have like these VR things cause you can, you can, um, uh, rent the VR headset.

02:20:31.720 --> 02:20:33.880
It's like right next to these other arcade games.

02:20:34.520 --> 02:20:36.040
The arcade isn't super impressive.

02:20:36.040 --> 02:20:38.600
It's like a couple of skee-ball machines, a couple of pinball machines and some classics.

02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:41.320
But I think it's interesting to have the VR arcade right next to that.

02:20:41.320 --> 02:20:44.360
And it looks like you can rent the headset for a little while and you, you can play that

02:20:44.360 --> 02:20:44.920
one.

02:20:44.920 --> 02:20:45.960
Bobby will know what I'm talking about.

02:20:45.960 --> 02:20:49.640
What's the, what's the music game with the blue and the orange shields that you hold

02:20:49.640 --> 02:20:52.760
up to absorb that, that that's one of the games.

02:20:52.760 --> 02:20:54.120
Not beat saver.

02:20:54.120 --> 02:20:55.480
No, it's not beat saver.

02:20:55.480 --> 02:20:58.600
It's kind of pre-dates that is earlier than that.

02:20:59.320 --> 02:21:01.000
I think beat saver would be more exciting.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:01.640
Audio shield.

02:21:01.640 --> 02:21:01.960
That's it.

02:21:01.960 --> 02:21:02.440
Thank you, Bobby.

02:21:02.440 --> 02:21:03.240
I knew you'd know it.

02:21:03.240 --> 02:21:05.480
So audio shields, the one that they're playing on that.

02:21:05.480 --> 02:21:10.200
I, this Mario Kart VR though, if you watch people playing that, I bet there'd be tons

02:21:10.200 --> 02:21:11.240
of people lined up for that.

02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:11.880
Yeah.

02:21:11.880 --> 02:21:12.840
Heck yeah.

02:21:12.840 --> 02:21:13.340
That's cool.

02:21:14.600 --> 02:21:19.720
Um, and then of course there's news saying that there's gonna be a new track coming to

02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:20.840
kingdom hearts three.

02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:25.160
It's a collaboration between Skrillex and Hikaru Tada.

02:21:25.800 --> 02:21:26.360
Sorry.

02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:27.000
Jumping in real quick.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.720
Cause I think this is a good comment in our chat at live.fognetwork.com.

02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:33.240
Bob coffee says, I'm willing to bet Nintendo shut them down because Mario Kart is going

02:21:33.240 --> 02:21:35.960
to be one of the rides and Nintendo land at universal.

02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:40.760
Well, it was that in that they were hitting, they were accidentally crashing into pedestrians

02:21:40.760 --> 02:21:41.480
and stuff like that.

02:21:41.480 --> 02:21:44.600
And so it was kind of making a bad name for a marker.

02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:45.880
That would be a way to end your day.

02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:47.000
Anyway.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:47.960
Sorry to interrupt you, Loki.

02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:53.480
Um, and then, yeah, so there was going to be a new track coming called face my fears,

02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:58.120
um, which is going to be sometime soon that they're going to debut that.

02:21:58.760 --> 02:21:59.080
All right.

02:21:59.080 --> 02:22:00.920
Let's go to the Skype line and take another call.

02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:01.080
Hi.

02:22:01.080 --> 02:22:01.960
You're on orange launch radio.

02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:02.360
Who's this?

02:22:03.080 --> 02:22:06.600
Hey, uh, uh, uh, uh, this is raging leader.

02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:06.920
Yes.

02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:07.640
What's up raging air.

02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:08.200
What's in your mind?

02:22:08.760 --> 02:22:10.040
Uh, not too much.

02:22:10.040 --> 02:22:15.400
Uh, two things, uh, to touch on, uh, the whole files, that thing that you were talking about

02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:15.960
earlier.

02:22:15.960 --> 02:22:16.840
Fuck my life.

02:22:16.840 --> 02:22:17.080
Yeah.

02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:18.440
All right.

02:22:19.080 --> 02:22:25.240
As much as I would love to agree with you 100%, I'll do so unofficially.

02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:30.120
Uh, it's already tired and old and overdone.

02:22:30.120 --> 02:22:36.520
It wasn't even funny to begin with, but there is a little bit of a hiccup.

02:22:37.240 --> 02:22:47.800
Um, looks like my significant other is jumping on board, uh, board, uh, you know, uh, train

02:22:47.800 --> 02:22:49.000
to stop.

02:22:49.880 --> 02:22:50.600
Yeah.

02:22:50.600 --> 02:22:57.400
So officially I have to support her and her decision to do it.

02:22:57.400 --> 02:23:03.960
So you don't have to, well, you can say that you have moral and religious objections now.

02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:08.680
Now I feel it's very important to support our significant others, especially when it

02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:11.960
has to do with dressing up like scantily clad video game characters.

02:23:11.960 --> 02:23:14.040
So I am all for this.

02:23:15.240 --> 02:23:15.640
Yeah.

02:23:15.640 --> 02:23:21.640
Well, I was going to say, well, there is that aspect, but if I ever want her to lay a single

02:23:21.640 --> 02:23:25.080
finger on me, I'm going to support her.

02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:28.920
100%, uh, therefore it's the greatest thing in the world.

02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:32.040
Um, so, ew.

02:23:32.040 --> 02:23:34.920
But, uh, I'm sorry.

02:23:34.920 --> 02:23:35.320
Ew.

02:23:35.320 --> 02:23:37.640
I didn't, anyway, yes.

02:23:37.640 --> 02:23:37.880
Okay.

02:23:37.880 --> 02:23:41.480
So is this just about Bowsette and your lady friend or is there, is there something else

02:23:41.480 --> 02:23:42.120
here?

02:23:42.120 --> 02:23:47.320
Well, you know, there, um, uh, there's a second thing, but, uh, I want to lead off.

02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:47.560
Yeah.

02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:48.120
Second thing.

02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:48.600
Let's do it.

02:23:49.240 --> 02:23:56.280
Oh, well, I can't remember if I brought this up the last time I called you short or not,

02:23:56.280 --> 02:24:00.680
but just in case I didn't, um, Lily is a gamer.

02:24:00.680 --> 02:24:01.240
You brought it up.

02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:09.240
Oh, well, um, uh, one thing I would like to ask is, do you know of any co-op games that,

02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:14.920
uh, we could play that's on PC that cancel, you know, towards horror?

02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:19.480
Uh, you, you kind of did ask about the horror thing, but no, you didn't ask about co-op,

02:24:19.480 --> 02:24:23.800
I guess the co-op horror game that's, uh, co-op get, get that PlayStation plus, uh,

02:24:23.800 --> 02:24:24.680
Friday the 13th.

02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:26.840
Well, yeah, there's that.

02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:32.040
And then there's also, it's not really a horror game per se, but, uh, don't starve is kind

02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:36.600
of got that, you know, it's got a little bit of like Adam's family macabre vibe.

02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:37.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:39.880
Yeah, she does have don't starve together.

02:24:39.880 --> 02:24:45.480
And in fact, uh, we were playing dad, uh, probably within the past week or so.

02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:49.800
Uh, you know, you know, it, it's a decent game.

02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:52.280
Unfortunately, I suck at it.

02:24:52.280 --> 02:24:57.880
What's the one everybody is fucking playing with the, the different roster of serial killers

02:24:57.880 --> 02:25:00.360
and like everybody's streaming it on Twitch dead, dead by daylight.

02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:01.000
Is that what it's called?

02:25:01.720 --> 02:25:02.840
Is that what I'm thinking of me?

02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:03.960
That sounds familiar.

02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:05.480
I think that's the one I'm thinking of.

02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:09.720
Um, where like you can play as like the shape from Halloween and Laurie Strode and all this

02:25:09.720 --> 02:25:10.360
shit.

02:25:10.360 --> 02:25:13.160
And like, it's, it's, it's like a four V one thing.

02:25:14.040 --> 02:25:16.200
It's a similar formula to the Friday the 13th.

02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:17.240
That sounds cool.

02:25:17.240 --> 02:25:18.120
I didn't know what that was.

02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:18.280
No.

02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:18.520
Yeah.

02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:19.320
It's, Oh God.

02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:20.920
It's, it's all over Twitch.

02:25:20.920 --> 02:25:21.160
Yeah.

02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:21.800
Dead by daylight.

02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:21.960
Thank you.

02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:22.520
Sue Deberry.

02:25:22.520 --> 02:25:23.240
I thought that's what it was.

02:25:24.520 --> 02:25:25.240
Oh, all right.

02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:25.480
Yeah.

02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:26.920
I'll definitely look into that.

02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:30.760
Um, now I want to help her build up her, uh, steam library.

02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:36.360
Her steam library is a little smaller compared to mine, which is kind of a no dust.

02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:37.320
It's not the size.

02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:38.280
It's how you use it.

02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:39.320
Yeah.

02:25:39.880 --> 02:25:45.240
Um, yeah, the only thing she, you know, she, uh, Syphon, uh, don't stop together.

02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:50.120
The only thing she, uh, he has that's co-op is portal two and she hasn't touched that

02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:50.680
forever.

02:25:50.680 --> 02:25:54.840
So, uh, but it's not exactly a scary game either, but it's fun.

02:25:54.840 --> 02:25:55.080
Yes.

02:25:56.040 --> 02:25:56.520
Yeah.

02:25:56.520 --> 02:25:56.840
Yeah.

02:25:56.840 --> 02:25:57.800
No doubt about it.

02:25:57.800 --> 02:25:58.600
It is fun.

02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:04.040
But, uh, you know, since she's really having to the horror games now, I'll definitely look

02:26:04.040 --> 02:26:04.760
into that.

02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:06.520
Rage Nader, I'm going to tell you what not to do.

02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:10.600
Don't get Mario party because that will end in divorce.

02:26:12.040 --> 02:26:16.680
Well, we're, you know, we have to get married first and besides she doesn't have any consoles

02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:18.360
anyways, just PC only.

02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:19.880
So it is just a joke.

02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:20.200
All right.

02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:23.240
Tons of cool characters in there.

02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:23.880
Yeah.

02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:24.280
All right.

02:26:24.280 --> 02:26:25.720
Uh, Rage Nader, I'm going to let you go.

02:26:25.720 --> 02:26:26.760
So, uh, take care.

02:26:26.760 --> 02:26:27.000
Okay.

02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:27.880
All right.

02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:28.440
Have a good one.

02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:28.680
All right.

02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:29.240
Bye.

02:26:29.240 --> 02:26:31.800
Like Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Leatherface.

02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:32.600
Yeah.

02:26:32.600 --> 02:26:35.640
They've got, well, it's a saw, but it jigsaw.

02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:41.320
Um, I don't know who some of these, I think they just made up.

02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:44.520
Yeah, they probably made some up and then the game was so good.

02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:47.160
It got a bunch of like license stuff and so forth.

02:26:47.160 --> 02:26:48.120
So pretty cool.

02:26:48.120 --> 02:26:48.360
All right.

02:26:48.360 --> 02:26:50.360
Orange launch radio, all one word on Skype.

02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:53.000
Just a few more minutes to get in while Loki recaps other stuff.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.160
One more piece of news that's pretty important.

02:26:55.880 --> 02:26:59.560
A very popular online game is getting a brand new expansion.

02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:01.080
It's 25th expansion.

02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:07.160
That is EverQuest is getting a brand new expansion called the Burning Lands.

02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:10.680
And I thought that was pretty notable.

02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:15.880
So, you know, it's going to have new monsters, new zones, items, raids, and more.

02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:24.840
So yeah, time to fire up your EverQuest online account.

02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:25.640
Or don't.

02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:27.320
I mean, the choice is yours.

02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:30.600
You can also not do that.

02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:37.160
No, I get, I get, look, I get, I've been such a bitch, but I'm sure there's people

02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:39.960
that play EverQuest out there that really enjoy it.

02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:40.360
And that's cool.

02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:42.920
Like if you invest all the time, it's like World of Warcraft.

02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:45.400
I'm kind of like World of Warcraft is kind of old at this point.

02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:48.440
It's showing its age, but like some people have invested so much time and stuff into

02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:50.040
that, like they don't really want to let it go.

02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:54.520
And I have to have a giant enemy snail because that is one of the new enemies.

02:27:55.480 --> 02:27:57.400
There are snails in World of Warcraft.

02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:00.280
World of Warcraft has those adorable llamas in the new expansion though.

02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:01.240
They're really cute.

02:28:01.240 --> 02:28:02.920
So it does have that.

02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:04.520
But do the llamas have crossbows?

02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:06.760
Not yet, but maybe they'll work on that.

02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:08.280
The Pandarians have crossbows.

02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:11.000
No, no, I don't know.

02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:12.460
All right.

02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:15.640
Anyway, I guess it's going to do it.

02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:18.840
We're not getting any other calls and I think Loki has ran through his last minute news.

02:28:18.840 --> 02:28:21.560
So I think that is where we wrap up for the night.

02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:24.360
But I want to thank you guys for tuning into our show and listening and participating

02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:25.160
with us tonight.

02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:28.360
If you didn't get through on Skype, but you want to still send us a shout, you can always

02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:32.040
just participate at orangelaundradio.com, our email, or you can always tweet at us at

02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:32.680
OLR.

02:28:32.680 --> 02:28:37.320
We're also on Facebook at facebook.com orangelaundradio, even if we're not posting on there.

02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:40.840
I always every day I log into Facebook, it goes, you haven't engaged with your people

02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:41.560
with orange laundry.

02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:42.680
I'm like, I don't know what to say.

02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:44.680
I guess I need to post more funny memes.

02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:48.200
I need to steal content from other places because that's what people do on Facebook.

02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:49.320
Is that what y'all want me to do?

02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:53.480
I don't think anyone sees anything on Facebook because that shit gets buried underneath

02:28:53.480 --> 02:28:54.680
advertisements and crap.

02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:55.320
That's true.

02:28:55.320 --> 02:28:56.200
That's true.

02:28:56.200 --> 02:28:56.700
All right.

02:28:57.320 --> 02:29:00.360
So I guess that's going to do it for another episode of the show.

02:29:00.360 --> 02:29:06.360
So let's go around and oh, before I get to final thoughts, I will say, as ever and always,

02:29:06.360 --> 02:29:10.440
if you enjoy what you heard here at orange launch radio, please give us a five star review

02:29:10.440 --> 02:29:12.680
on iTunes or Google play.

02:29:12.680 --> 02:29:16.360
Cause those nice reviews go a very long way in helping spread the word about the show.

02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:20.360
But you know what's even better telling a friend or two or five about the show, help

02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:22.760
us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:24.600
But the voices aren't here to air.

02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:29.080
It's going to be the same phone call every week.

02:29:29.080 --> 02:29:29.580
Just kidding.

02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:33.320
So anyway, I think that's it.

02:29:33.320 --> 02:29:35.560
So I guess it's final thought time.

02:29:35.560 --> 02:29:38.600
So my final thought tonight is I'm going to stream after the show.

02:29:39.240 --> 02:29:42.840
I did a poll on my Twitter over at mr Rob Roberts.

02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:47.240
And I think when I last checked classic NES stuff was winning for what we're going to

02:29:47.240 --> 02:29:47.880
stream tonight.

02:29:49.560 --> 02:29:51.240
Yeah, that's the winners classic NES stuff.

02:29:51.240 --> 02:29:53.160
So that's what we're going to do tonight after the show.

02:29:53.160 --> 02:29:57.640
So over at my Twitch channel, Rob Roberts, Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:29:57.640 --> 02:30:00.920
I was hoping to work on more game development stuff this week.

02:30:00.920 --> 02:30:06.760
I've been really tired after doing a lot of exercising and crap and just, just haven't

02:30:06.760 --> 02:30:11.240
had the intelligence to do it at late at night and just kind of sit down and watch TV.

02:30:11.240 --> 02:30:14.280
So I got through maniac finally, which is pretty awesome on Netflix.

02:30:14.280 --> 02:30:18.520
And also I recommend if you haven't checked it out yet, American Vandal is hilarious,

02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:19.560
especially season two.

02:30:20.280 --> 02:30:26.280
Um, it's, it's a funny mockumentary type thing talking about like these like school,

02:30:27.640 --> 02:30:29.160
like pranksters and stuff.

02:30:29.160 --> 02:30:31.000
And it's, it's really funny to watch.

02:30:31.560 --> 02:30:32.600
It's, it's fun.

02:30:33.560 --> 02:30:34.040
All right.

02:30:34.040 --> 02:30:35.160
And maniacs pretty good too.

02:30:36.120 --> 02:30:36.600
All right.

02:30:36.600 --> 02:30:38.280
Well, we'll see you in seven days.

02:30:38.280 --> 02:30:39.320
We'll do this all over again.

02:30:39.320 --> 02:30:41.800
Our buddy Delvin from video game realness also going to be here next week.

02:30:41.800 --> 02:30:43.880
So it's going to be a very, uh, screamy loud show.

02:30:43.880 --> 02:30:47.800
It should be fun because Delvin and I, when we get around each other, so Loki will be

02:30:47.800 --> 02:30:51.560
having a good, maybe our screams will, um, he's a big Nintendo fan too.

02:30:51.560 --> 02:30:53.560
So that'd be really fun to have you guys in the same room.

02:30:53.560 --> 02:30:54.200
So all right.

02:30:54.200 --> 02:30:56.440
Yeah, it's on next week.

02:30:56.440 --> 02:30:57.480
No, we're going to have a great show.

02:30:57.480 --> 02:31:01.080
I look forward to, uh, you can't do anything dumb this week.

02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:04.440
I mean, you're releasing super Mario party.

02:31:04.440 --> 02:31:07.160
So I guess that's not entirely bad unless it's fucked up.

02:31:07.160 --> 02:31:08.920
And then in which case you'll hear.

02:31:08.920 --> 02:31:09.800
All right, we're out.

02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:11.880
We'll see what happens in seven days when we see you next time.

02:31:11.880 --> 02:31:14.280
Thank you guys so much for listening to and supporting orange launch radio.

02:31:15.240 --> 02:31:17.960

02:31:37.720 --> 02:31:42.200
radio or fog network, but you know, they were all still true.
