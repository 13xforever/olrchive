00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This week, Pokemon Go became canon by officially debuting a brand new Pokemon, though we still

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,120
have to wait for information beyond its looks. This is one new item amongst a sea of classics,

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,600
join us for a healthy mix of both in the week's news starting right now on the show, where

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:33,680
every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio. Hello my friends out there on the internet,

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,640
welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,160
Radio, live tonight on September the 30th of 2018 with episode number 746 of our show.

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,600
I am Rob Roberts and joining me here in studio is Loki. How are you, Loki? Hello, I'm fine.

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,320
Yeah, fun week? Good week? No, I'm alright. Gaming? Do any DDR? We've had a lot of talk

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,360
about DDR's 20th anniversary this past week. We'll get into it, we have a news item later

10
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,160
about how Konami is acknowledging that, but have you done anything special to acknowledge 20 years

11
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,800
of DDR, Loki? I played a lot of DDR, that's about it. That's the way to do it. You know what's funny

12
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,080
is that out of the blue I got a message from a Facebook friend asking me questions about DDR

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,840
because they were like, you know, what was the good PlayStation mix because we want to set up

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,120
a dance pad and do all this thing and I'm like, dang, what a throwback because I'm thinking about

15
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,840
it's kind of sad you can't really play DDR anymore on PlayStation 3 or 4 like Konami just didn't

16
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,560
really push the series. Looking for your music game peripherals? You can find them used everywhere.

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,560
I know, I know. They were asking about like what type of pad should they get? They already were

18
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,520
kind of leaning towards the foam. You remember when Red Octane back in the day had those foamy

19
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,240
and I always thought those were probably the best ones. Step Maniacs. And the big zipper pouch.

20
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,280
The Step Maniacs pads. The ones that are like a thousand dollars. Oh, the metal? Oh, the actual

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,640
game. They actually sell the pads. No, I know. I know. I think they've been, those things have

22
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,240
been selling out as fast as they can make them. I see some of the stuff on Kyle Ward's Facebook,

23
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,360
like they just can't keep that stuff. I'm just glad I don't have to worry about that crap anymore

24
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,240
when I was like, oh, I'm going to build the better pads so they can actually play arcade DDR.

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,080
There you go. Uh, go into our chat over at live.vog network.com because we do date live

26
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,880
every Sunday night at the voice geeks network of vog network.com six o'clock Pacific nine

27
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,560
o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby black Wolf show. Orange right says, check your local

28
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,360
thrift stores. Oh yeah, we go to Goodwill every Saturday and um, they have all sorts of DJ hero

29
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,360
stuff and it's funny cause they don't really know how it's supposed to go together. So they have

30
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,880
like two turntables in the mixer in the middle. They're like, yeah, that's about right. Looks,

31
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:44,320
we don't know what this is, but it's $5 nailed it. All right. Uh, uh, dark Sakura, uh, not here

32
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,480
tonight. She is a on her work commitment for a little while longer, but she'll be joining us

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,880
a little later in the show for the classic game of the week. Um, so we'll talk a little more about

34
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,200
DDR and music stuff later, but let's get into the kickoff topic for tonight, which is a pretty big

35
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,880
update, something we've been waiting for. We wondered if the internet would really be able

36
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:10,920
to have some power over Sony and it looks like Sony has caved a little bit on, on what people

37
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:18,120
been asking about. Right. Logie. Yeah, they caved. Um, they're basically now allowing cross-play for

38
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,520
Fortnite. So, you know, following a comprehensive evaluation process, SIE has identified a path

39
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:30,080
towards support for cross-platform features for on select third party content. We recognize that

40
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,880
PlayStation four players have been eerily awaiting an update and we appreciate the community's

41
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,200
continued patience as we have navigated through the issue of the finest solution. Bullshit. You

42
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:47,920
just had a fucking backlash against your shit and that's why I like how you just just cut off the

43
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,360
official statement. Now, now this is lies. This is lies. The official statement is just like, we're

44
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,120
really, of course, you know, the vice president, they said, when you know, we're really happy for

45
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,680
the PlayStation Fortnite communities and this is a great step and we know that rocket league players

46
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,280
and their own communities wants to know what this means for them, but we don't have any updates at

47
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,680
the moment. In other words, the biggest game where the people are the loudest needed to get it the

48
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,640
first and in some ways, which was the most fucked up implementation because of the whole locked

49
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,720
account where like you couldn't even play it on the switch if you had a PlayStation four and all

50
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,480
that stuff. And they are releasing a process to unlink your account from the PlayStation four and

51
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,760
be able to play on all of them. Yay. So that's going to be happening soon. Well, that's great.

52
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,440
I wish I had time there that came to their senses. Yeah, I know. I wish I played more Fortnite to be

53
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,520
able to really appreciate this news, but, uh, I don't play a lot of it, but I know tons of people

54
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,560
do. So this is certainly a good start. But, um, let me ask about this. Like, is this, I mean,

55
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,120
cause this is still, it's almost kind of like a weird way of thinking now because this opens

56
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,880
Pandora's box. I'm not mistaken. They're not saying this is going to be limited to Fortnite.

57
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,920
They didn't come out and say only Fortnite is going to get an exception. They're basically

58
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,160
saying this is something we're going to be looking at in the future. So, you know,

59
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,440
like rocket league, like you mentioned, even though there might not be plans right this

60
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,160
second, I'm sure it's something they're, you know, going to be looking at in the next few months.

61
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:17,000
Um, what else? I'm Minecraft has gotta be something. Minecraft's weird cause it's a Microsoft game,

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,560
but I would think though that they should like plain. Well, yeah, and that's going to be a big

63
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,680
like news, but still Nintendo played nice with them. And come on, Nintendo is so backwards when

64
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,640
it comes to networking stuff that like if they're doing it, you probably should be doing it. Yeah,

65
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,200
I get it. You're, you're scared because you, you want to, you know, stop any sort of ways for

66
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,080
people to hack your platform. It doesn't matter what you do. They're going to find a way. And if

67
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,640
you do this kind of crap where you block stuff off and you like cripple different, you're just giving

68
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:51,720
them incentive to do exactly. Yeah. So it, you know, take it from Nintendo. I mean, they know

69
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,640
better. They, even though they have the cross platform stuff, I mean that hasn't stopped their

70
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:02,280
platform from getting hacked and you know, getting their characters turned into sex memes and shit

71
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,920
like that. What do you think will be the next game to, uh, and I asked this of our chat room as well.

72
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,840
What do you think will be the next game to cross over? You think rocket league is kind of obvious

73
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,640
one? It's a switch. It literally is just like a switch to flip on for them. Um, I would say

74
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:21,240
Overwatch, um, not PC so much because blizzard has made the decision. They don't want keyboard

75
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,080
and mouse mixed with controller, which is going to be weird though, because yeah, I know it's coming

76
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,320
up later. We'll talk about that. We'll get into that then. Um, but, um, as far as like PlayStation

77
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,240
four and Xbox one, there shouldn't really be anything, um, separate news consoles anymore.

78
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,880
And another reason why I target Overwatch is, well, I mean, it's a big deal. Overwatch is

79
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,880
everywhere and Blizzcon is coming up. This would be a great thing. I mean, surely if I were blizzard,

80
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,800
I would be pushing to make this an announcement. We're going to make it. Blizzcon is that

81
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:54,280
Overwatch will soon be playable on PlayStation four and Xbox one cross platform, especially,

82
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,360
especially if they're working on a switch version after all, which I kind of, I actually don't think

83
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,200
they are, but I mean, I would love to be wrong on that. I would love, love, love to be wrong on that

84
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,400
and have a switch version of Overwatch. Um, and that would be fantastic if it was completely

85
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,400
playable across all those platforms. Although there is a part of me that thinks PC should be

86
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,840
involved in that as well. And blizzard might need to think about, um, just having keyboard and mouse

87
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,120
designation versus, you know, uh, controller designation, but I'm sure I think they'd be

88
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,160
worried people would try to hack that. Do you remember back in this, funny enough, we were talking

89
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:31,800
about DDR, right? Do you remember in DDR ultra mix, when you would play online, you could see

90
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,800
if the person was using a dance pad or a controller. But the thing was, is that it had to be an

91
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,600
officially licensed dance pad for it to show up as dance pad, or it would show up as a controller

92
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,840
because I think the USB was probably sending some sort of special signal to the Xbox. I have an ID.

93
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,400
Yeah. I don't know how it all worked, but I just remember that. So it's like, they could probably

94
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,880
do that with like a keyboard mouse signature versus a, uh, I already have peripherals that

95
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,480
could do keyboard and mouse if they really want to. That's true. That's true. So I don't know,

96
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,200
maybe blizzard needs to, I think about that a little bit, uh, going to chat at live.vognetwork.com.

97
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,800
Uh, Brad from Pod Culture agrees, bring Overwatch to Switch. Uh, Dortitsuya says, I agree with Loki

98
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,560
though, either Rocket League or Minecraft. Um, let's see, Kaijuto in chat says, I bet the crossplay

99
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,680
gets underused too if there's some type of option for crossplay. You know, let's talk about that

100
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:26,120
comment for a minute actually. Is, is after all the bitching and moaning and whining,

101
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,240
which I really think the catalyst for this was the locking of the Fortnite accounts.

102
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,160
I don't think you would have seen the big backlash that you did if people had been able to log in and

103
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,160
make their Switch account, no problem. I think if Sony wants to pinpoint, where did we fuck up?

104
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,200
That did you in? Uh, cause I honestly think if that hadn't been a factor and you could still

105
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,040
make an account wherever, people would have just accepted the fact that, eh, whatever,

106
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:56,040
you can only play on whatever platform. Because of this, you know, the previous thing where they

107
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,880
locked shit out and because of the statements like, well, we're just the best platform. So

108
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,040
that's why we just don't want to play nice. Their follow-up statements weren't exactly graceful.

109
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,560
And also their support for mods on the platform versus what the support is on the Microsoft

110
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,160
platform. I'm just like, if it comes across platform stuff, if I'm going to purchase a

111
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,880
game on one of those two platforms, I'm not going to purchase it on Sony's platform.

112
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,720
Granted, I don't have a Microsoft console by PC, so I just will play it on PC. But might it

113
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,080
influence your decision when we're talking PlayStation five and Xbox max? Absolutely.

114
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:33,000
It will. Yeah. So this will be very interesting where when we start announcing those consoles,

115
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,320
which could be as soon as next year, probably more, I don't know, actually,

116
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,560
do you think Microsoft's going to plunk down Xbox next? That's what I'm going to call it for now.

117
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,560
Cause obviously we don't know what the name will be. Do you think, um, Microsoft's going to plunk

118
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,720
down Xbox next next year? Cause they've already, they've already done the little, little, little

119
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,560
tittle teas. Probably I'd say maybe a couple more years. I think 2020, I would have guessed 2020 for

120
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,800
both, but I don't know. Then Microsoft kind of did a little, maybe they want to be first out the gate

121
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:06,040
like they were with three 60. Who knows? Yeah. I don't know. Uh, Brad, the stuff that they have

122
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,880
right now, they could change. It's just policy that they don't agree with. Well, going back to

123
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,600
guys, you just comment about cross play getting underused. I mean, it's kind of a good call out.

124
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,320
How many people are really going to be using this cross play thing? Maybe it's different in a game

125
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,040
like Fortnite where they're trying to load up a hundred players or whatever. But I mean, I don't

126
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,920
know, like I haven't really sat there and thought about like, who do I want to invite on Xbox when

127
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,360
I'm playing on my PlayStation? I mean, if this rule is really changing, it almost kind of makes

128
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:44,920
me have to think about the way that I approach this online gaming. Because to be fair, even if

129
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:50,680
cross play is going to be a deal, there are still some things that are locked away. For example,

130
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:58,200
party chat, right? Now, if the party chat is in the Fortnite game, then I imagine that'll work

131
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,760
cross platform. I haven't really heard about voice chat, but I'm thinking more of the fact that like,

132
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:09,000
on PlayStation, you can have like a localized party on PlayStation, right? And then I believe

133
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,120
it's the same type of deal on Microsoft's platform, right? So if I'm kind of working

134
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,560
with my own little party here, I wouldn't necessarily be able to talk to the people

135
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:21,880
on the Microsoft side. So there are some things that are still kind of locked if I'm not mistaken,

136
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:30,120
right? So you still would have the best experience if you're all on one ecosystem, am I right?

137
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,880
I suppose.

138
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,600
See, we haven't even we haven't even bothered to think about this, which is just hooray.

139
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,920
I think that's all done in because that's why they have voice chat with, you know,

140
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,920
Fortnite right now in the Switch version is because it's in the actual app and not the,

141
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,160
you know, it's not linked to the console or anything.

142
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,000
Okay, let me go to chat at live.vognetware.com. Bobby Blackwell says, it's more about playing

143
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,800
with friends that may have other consoles. For instance, I wouldn't know where to buy Overwatch.

144
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,720
I have people to play Overwatch on PC. I have people to play on PS4. I have people to play on

145
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,280
Xbox One. If I could buy one Overwatch and play it with all my friends, that would make me more

146
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:19,480
likely to play Overwatch. I'm lucky enough to have all the consoles and I have all the consoles as

147
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,760
well. But I mean, the kind of the point I'm trying to make there is that it may not quite be that

148
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:33,640
easy. If the chat is on Battle.net's side, which I think it is, it would for PC, it has to be.

149
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:39,560
So the chat is on Battle.net side for PC. But what if you want to chat with the people on

150
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,320
PlayStation and you get in one of those, are you going to be able to voice chat with them

151
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,080
if the voice chat isn't supported through Battle.net on consoles? Does that make sense

152
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,040
what I'm saying? Yes. Then you're not, you're playing with them, but you're not really able

153
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,040
to interact with them and you might still kind of be back at the square one problem.

154
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,440
So this is going to put an onus, if I'm not mistaken, on the third parties to have their

155
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,640
own server structures so that people can use voice chat. Or you just need to get Discord apps on all

156
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,680
consoles then. Oh, you think that could be a thing? Discord on consoles? Do you think Sony or

157
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,080
Microsoft is interested on Discord? Actually, didn't Microsoft have a partnership with Discord of some

158
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:21,320
sort? I don't think Discord's on Xbox, but I remember Microsoft wanted to cuddle up with them.

159
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,920
That's true. That's true. Let's see. Yeah, Microsoft has a partnership with Discord.

160
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,080
I thought that was a thing, but they have a partnership, but that doesn't mean a Discord

161
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:38,360
app on Xbox One yet. Maybe that's something where it's going. Anyway. Oh yeah, they show the game

162
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,920
you're playing on Discord. That was what it was. If you connect your Xbox Live and you're playing

163
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,640
something on Xbox, it will show on Discord. Kind of like Spotify will show what you're listening

164
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,800
to. That whole type of thing. Yeah. Yeah. So interesting. Let's see. Dr. Tzuyu says,

165
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,040
maybe that's why Nintendo didn't do any of that stuff for online. If they're open to cross-play,

166
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,960
that would have, they would have had to worry about all that stuff. So I guess they decided

167
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,440
to just make it simple. Yeah. I don't know. I think we're still going to find some things out

168
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:12,120
as time goes on, but I do firmly believe that we would never have been at this point

169
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,200
if Fortnite accounts hadn't been locked, if you'd used it on PlayStation 4. I think that

170
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:23,560
was the thing that made this whole thing fall apart. Yeah. I don't think, I don't think the,

171
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,320
the call would have been this loud. I don't think everybody would have been as crazy, but that,

172
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,120
that was the thing that, that did him in, especially when Sony knows that for the longest

173
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:37,640
time, Nintendo has been competing to be the other console in everybody's house. Right. We've known

174
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,840
that for some time. Nintendo has always been competing to be the other console in somebody's

175
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:46,680
house. It's never really competed on that same level in some regards as PlayStation 4 and Xbox

176
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,920
One. Although there are plenty of households where the Switch is the only co or Wii U,

177
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:57,800
Wii whatever, is the only console to be found. So, interesting. VidPower in chat says,

178
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:03,080
it'd be interesting if Microsoft chooses Discord over Skype, which they own. It would be

179
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:10,200
interesting because Microsoft does own Skype, but you don't really think about Skype for gaming very

180
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:16,520
often. Skype is how you call your family with, in another country with free long distance,

181
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,480
I think is, or, or free internet, you know, VoIP or whatever. Uh, I think that's what a lot of

182
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,280
people are associating Skype with. I don't know. A lot of the online games I've played that are like

183
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,120
the, the reality stuff I've talked about before on the show, like Survivor and Big Brother,

184
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,440
they all play on Skype because Skype is you, everybody fucking has Skype because it's on

185
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:40,360
every Windows computer. I guess, I guess, but Skype, I mean, everybody has it. Like,

186
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,160
it's very easy to get on a mobile app. It's on the fricking PC. It's preloaded with Windows.

187
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,640
I know, right? So it's like everybody, even if you have a Mac, like it's very easy to get Skype.

188
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:56,840
It's just an app on, you know, the, the OS store. So Skype, I feel like a lot of people use Skype,

189
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,240
but that's just my perception. And that's, that's not even talking about here at OLR,

190
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,200
which by the way, on that note, before we get into our gaming weeks,

191
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,840
did you know that Skype will finally stop working on this potato XP computer as of November 1st?

192
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:18,040
Well, I know, right? So they said that they're not gonna support the old Skype 7 or whatever,

193
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,360
and it's gonna force you to go to the newest Skype, which of course doesn't work on XP,

194
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,200
which I know you all give me shit about the fact that I'm still running XP for this show, but A,

195
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,600
money doesn't fucking grow on trees. So I haven't exactly bought, you know, the upgrade computer,

196
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,920
but to be fair, it is in the path because obviously we're going to be talking about

197
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,160
Twitch streaming. I can't Twitch stream on this current computer. So it was always part of that

198
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,560
path was to, yes, finally get off of this potato computer that we've been using for so long, um,

199
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,720
to do the video streaming and all that. But it's just, it's just irritating to have that arbitrary

200
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,800
deadline put in because they don't want to support the old Skype anymore. You know,

201
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,120
DDR ace runs XP embedded, so it's fine. That's right. You know what? Your arcade

202
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:05,880
games still use windows XP, so get off my ass. I guess we could always use the tablet

203
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,560
kind of like we used to use before. Um, I have thought about just straight up,

204
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,440
maybe switching to discord at this point. Um, I don't know. I'd be curious about your guys's

205
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:19,640
feedback, but you'd have to tweet us or use, use our, use our discord to tell me what you think.

206
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,160
If maybe now is the time with this whole Skype thing changing,

207
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,600
maybe it's just time. We just go to discord for calls. So tell me what you think.

208
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:33,720
Anyway. Um, rage nator and chat suggests clearly you have the wrong fucking trees. Oh,

209
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,680
well if you have some money seeds, please let me know. I would love to grow some of

210
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,720
those in my backyard amongst everything else that's growing out there. Um, thank you,

211
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,680
thank you, Brad from pod culture. I can get you a free copy of seven or eight if you want.

212
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,320
I appreciate that. I actually have a serial number for 10. Thanks to a kind listener.

213
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,040
I just, you know, have to have the machine that makes it work, which I have some parts.

214
00:17:54,040 --> 00:18:00,520
It's just, everything's a mess. So actually, I honestly, I kind of wanted to go to a laptop

215
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,800
so that the show could be portable as well. So that's still something that's in the back

216
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,160
of my mind, but I have to make all those decisions the next month or two.

217
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,880
But, uh, yeah, like I said, money doesn't grow on trees. I'm not going to ask the listeners

218
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:17,000
for money. I don't want to do that. Um, I will, uh, you know, I have money set aside. It's just,

219
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
you know, working that all out. Anyway, enough about that behind the scenes stuff.

220
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,160
Let's get into the types of games that we have been playing this week in how was your

221
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,840
gaming week. So Loki, what types of video games you've been playing this week?

222
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,640
Mainly Pokemon go, um, because I've been doing a lot of walking, so I've been playing that.

223
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:40,280
Um, aside from that, actually, I forgot to mention the last week I played, um,

224
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,480
old school musical, which is fantastic. It's a rhythm music game. That's got a

225
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,000
lot of homages to old NES and super NES games.

226
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,640
And then I also played lots of dances, revolution, extreme. That's pretty much it.

227
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:02,520
I watched, um, I watched, uh, Bobby Black Wolf play some of that old school musical on his

228
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,680
Twitch stream. It looked really fun. It looked kind of like guitar man, but like retro style.

229
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,920
Yeah. Kind of cool. And then they have like this, I've already beaten the game and then they have

230
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:16,040
this, um, like chicken crusader mode thing. The, you play a lot of the same songs again,

231
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,680
but they add modifiers to them to make them harder to play.

232
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,800
So I'm going through that right now. Okay. That's cool. Um, yeah, there's, there's,

233
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,560
is that, is that the DLC or is the DLC like a whole separate thing? Cause Bobby's talking

234
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,160
about, he hasn't played the DLC yet. Um, I don't remember that it's DLC or not.

235
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,280
I did buy the DLC. I think the DLC adds more songs to that mode.

236
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,200
Okay. I'll, uh, I'll have to, I will, it's on my list of things to check out, but you know,

237
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,960
you know me, I'm always stuck with the online games. So let's talk about my gaming week and

238
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,480
all the online games I've been playing. Cause I'm still trucking along in world of Warcraft.

239
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,880
I hit max level, which is now believe it or not max level in world of Warcraft is 120.

240
00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:00,440
That's the highest level you can get to when wow first came out, 60 was the cap. So it grew 70,

241
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:06,040
80, 85, 90, a hundred, 110, 120. That's where all the, that's how many expansions this game's had.

242
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,400
That's a lot of expansion. I know. Right. But wow is kind of an old game at this point,

243
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,320
if you think about it. But, um, yeah, I'm, I'm still enjoying the expansion. This is

244
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,520
about the point where I'd usually burn out cause I'm not really interested in rating,

245
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,160
but we'll see how it goes. Who knows? Um, so there's that. Uh, and then, um,

246
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,080
I've still been playing Final Fantasy 14. I'm juggling two MMOs. It's crazy.

247
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,280
But, uh, you know, I'll, I'll get a text message like, Hey, let's do an expert if I have SE 14.

248
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,960
So I'll switch over, do the expert. And it's kind of like, I'm keeping my feet wet in that game.

249
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,320
But right now, wow. Kind of feels like what's more new and exciting. Even though 14 had a patch,

250
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:47,640
like, and I love 14, but I really hope their next expansion isn't as formulaic as these past couple

251
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,520
expansions have been. And what I mean by that is that here comes the point one patch, which will

252
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:58,040
have two new dungeons and an eight man raid. Here comes the point two patch, which will have two new

253
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,800
dungeons or one new dungeon and a 24 man raid. Here comes that back to the eight man raid,

254
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,840
back to the 24 man raid and a dungeon or two dungeon. It's like, it's very, very predictable.

255
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,800
And there's not enough, like, I just want to like fuck around and do something different stuff,

256
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,600
which wow, because it's been around so fucking long and he has all these expansions.

257
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:24,120
Wow. Definitely feels like there's like so much like other like crap you can do in that game.

258
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,800
Like if you want to get into like the pet battles and all that, that whole Pandora's box,

259
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:33,000
that's a whole thing you can do. Uh, the time walking I noticed was a great catch up mechanic.

260
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,120
I didn't want to do the cataclysm dungeons cause that's what's going on. But I was like,

261
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,640
oh, I'll go do one. And I got so many points from doing the, the time walking as a healer.

262
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,600
I was able to get like all this sweet gear to like bump my gear scores. It was really cool. So,

263
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,520
um, Raginator says, wow, came out when? 2004? Yeah, that sounds about right. And Brad from

264
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:58,520
Pod Culture at live.vognetware.com says time for wow remastered. Well, funny you say that because

265
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,800
World of Warcraft classic is going to start, they're doing this weird thing. So

266
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:12,520
it's not launching in November, but if you buy the virtual BlizzCon ticket that they want to sell you,

267
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,840
you will have access to the demo for World of Warcraft classic, which kind of blows my mind

268
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:25,000
because I'm like, how, what? It's, it's classic, just regular world and it's classic World of

269
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,160
Warcraft. Why is there no, so basically they're selling you early access to World of Warcraft

270
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,520
classic. That's what it is. That's just not where they're calling it. They're calling it a beta.

271
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,600
Don't they have like a free demo right now for World of Warcraft, the regular World of Warcraft?

272
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,760
If you want to, like you can play, it's either level 20 or level 40 you can, but again,

273
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,720
there's 120 fucking levels. You can play for like free. So there's a lot you can do.

274
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,720
There's your fucking demo. Why buy one? No, it's so, it's so weird. We're going to sell them and

275
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,800
get this guys. We're going to sell them a demo for a game that's right now. That's free to play.

276
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,040
Let's start off with, but we're going to even include less features in it and they're going

277
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,200
to pay for it. That's what people want. They're only doing World of Warcraft classic because

278
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,400
the fan base was like, I missed a day of molten core and back in my day you had to be level 40

279
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,360
to get a mountain. You had to work for it. So finally, after all this rabble rabble and the,

280
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,840
the servers, the fakie servers that Activision Blizzard finally had shut down, they were like,

281
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:25,400
fine, you want classic World of Warcraft. We will spend resources to, to bring back classic

282
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,440
Warcraft. But if you think about it, like, it's not as easy as making the old client available

283
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,400
because like, like computers are vastly different. So they have to be re optimized.

284
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,080
I would imagine they've got to go back and tune it now for widescreen

285
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,040
because World of Warcraft back then didn't even support fucking widescreen.

286
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,440
Fuck that. Don't make it widescreen. Make it four by three. This is what they fucking want.

287
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,840
Let them have it. Just put some borders around it. I honestly think World of Warcraft classic

288
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,480
will be that thing. You go back and play once and be like, wow, this wasn't as good as I remember

289
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,840
because that's what always happens. It's never as good like the PlayStation classic.

290
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:05,160
I think, wow, he's like old, but here's the thing. And I say this respectfully with many

291
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:10,600
friends who love Blizzard products and as a Blizzard fan myself, Blizzard fandom is a cult

292
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:16,680
and people will pay that money to do that. And, and Blizzard is the masters at this.

293
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,080
And this is a company that's owned by Activision and Activision will charge you for whatever you

294
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,120
want to buy. But here's the thing. Activision lets Blizzard do whatever they want because

295
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,760
Blizzard is good at it. You will notice Blizzard has managed to really, for the most part, stay

296
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,120
very independently Blizzard. There's very few things where Activision has kind of like

297
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,680
come in and said, no, no, no. And that would be probably putting Destiny and Call of Duty

298
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:46,280
on the battle net launcher. But what, but honestly, Activision's smart in doing that because they

299
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:52,040
know Blizzard is a cult and the easiest way to bring awareness to Destiny is to put it on the

300
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:58,040
battle net launcher. Imagine if people could buy the battle net launcher with wow gold, or I'm

301
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:03,320
sorry, if people could buy Destiny 2 with wow gold, which you can, I mean, it takes a lot of gold to

302
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:10,120
do it, but technically you can do it. It's crazy. But anyway. And again, I say that as a fan of

303
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,080
Blizzard, because you know what else I played this week? Diablo 3, cause season 15 is going on.

304
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,880
And now I'm sitting here going, I do kind of want to get this on the Switch, I think. And I'm,

305
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,360
I'm like, I'm having that whole like angel and devil on the shoulders, except I actually think

306
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,760
it's two devils yelling and screaming at each other because like I have one devil going,

307
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:35,560
you fucking moron, you already own Diablo on PC and PlayStation 4. And I think Xbox 360 as well.

308
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,080
Like I already owned Diablo 3 three times. Like, do I really need the Switch version?

309
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,160
And then the other devil's going, of course you need it.

310
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,760
Because it's new and shiny and everybody else is going to be playing it and it'll make for

311
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:55,640
good live streams. It's the devil and the devil on my shoulder. Some of you have devils and angels

312
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:02,680
on your shoulders. No, I have two devils. Anyway, what else did I do in my game a week? Oh, one more

313
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,440
game that I definitely have to mention. One other game that I played this week, cause I did a live

314
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,400
stream of this. I played Time Spinner, which is the brand new game that's been in development

315
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,440
for a while. In fact, we had the developer of Time Spinner on OLR. It was a few years ago,

316
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,880
it wasn't long after the Kickstarter. So it was a few years ago and Time Spinner came out and I

317
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,040
played it on stream and it's fun. I mean, if you like Castlevania Symphony of the Night,

318
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:33,800
bam. Time Spinner is a great homage to that. It's not like a carbon copy because the weapons are a

319
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,840
little different. Obviously the bosses, the story is completely different. So it's not like you're

320
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,720
just playing the same game. And also, they do some different stuff. Like you have a time stop

321
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,880
mechanic, which as you kind of watch the way I'm thinking in the live stream, playing this game

322
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,360
for the first time, I kind of realized like, oh, this time stop mechanic has many uses. Like,

323
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:59,400
it's not like your typical, like get the double jump, which allows you to get up to this level

324
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,080
that you couldn't get to before. And now you progress. Like that's, that's the way

325
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:08,600
Metroidvanias have always worked, right? Now you have the underwater suit. You can go swimming and

326
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,720
access the next level. Like, but the time stopping mechanic kind of has a variety of uses.

327
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:20,520
Like you can use it to stop an enemy in midair. So you can effectively do a very amateurish double

328
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,280
jump. Basically you jump on the monster, then jump on the ledge. You can do that. Or I found that

329
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,720
using the time stop mechanic through trial and error, you know, watch me play that boss fight

330
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,960
that I was stuck on for like 15 minutes, because you see me kind of thinking through,

331
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,200
okay, I'm gonna do this boss the normal way. And then I realized, oh, using the time stop mechanic

332
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,320
makes this boss a ton easier. And you can use this to kind of, you know, do something about

333
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,480
the charges and some of the other things. Now, of course, your time stop mechanic is limited

334
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,000
in how much you can use it. So you have to kind of be thinking about all that. But I like it,

335
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,680
it added another layer to a formula that many of you are already familiar with. So I really

336
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,680
like that. And Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, Rob buried the lead. His internet works now. Yes,

337
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,680
I wanted to get to that. I was, you might've said I was able to live stream time spinner.

338
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:13,400
So my internet is fixed at home. So here's the thing. So you remember Comcast tech number two

339
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:19,480
came out last week. And although he was nice and he listened to my problem and he didn't try to

340
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:25,240
sell me a BS answer, long story short, he wasn't able to fix the problem. So they were going to

341
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,560
send a third lead out here. And I originally had him scheduled for Wednesday, but I forgot, oops,

342
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,080
Alan had a doctor appointment Wednesday morning, so he couldn't be here in case the appointment

343
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,840
ran long. So I was like, whatever, I've dealt with it this long. Let's just do two more days.

344
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,120
So I rescheduled the third tech they were going to send out for Friday.

345
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,400
I'm trying not to bore you with this story too much, but it's fucking fascinating.

346
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:49,640
So Wednesday at around 11 o'clock, Alan messages me. He's like, I'm back from my doctor's

347
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,240
appointment. It seems like the internet's down right now. Something, something must be going on.

348
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,200
I'm like, all right, whatever. And he said noon, it came back up and he's like, wouldn't it be

349
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:05,800
funny if... And then he goes silent for about 30 seconds and he comes back and he says, hahaha,

350
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,960
I'm going to run out into the street and play in traffic. And he sends me a screenshot of the

351
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,760
upload to Google working full speed. I'm like, so the internet, like, did the tech just come out

352
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:20,040
here anyway and fix something? I don't know. But you know what I did notice, Loki, later in the

353
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:25,240
weekend, they've been doing all this construction on a house around the corner. I don't know if you

354
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,040
ever drive... I don't want to give away my home too much, but there's like a park there.

355
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,480
And sometimes you drive around the park on purpose to get the pokey stops, right?

356
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,120
I do.

357
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,400
Okay. Yeah, I do too. Even though it's not the most direct route, I drive it to get the pokey

358
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,440
stops. So there's a house over there as you go around. There's been an Xfinity van parked out

359
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,720
there like three times this past week. And I'm like, oh my God, like whatever they're doing on

360
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,040
that house, that was my problem. It probably wasn't. Maybe they were having the same problem.

361
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:59,480
And then they found, oh, hey, it's like a splitter or something in one of these junction boxes

362
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:05,080
that's fucked up. And so they went and fixed that. And lo and behold, it works for the whole

363
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,360
neighborhood.

364
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,520
Yeah. Bobby Bockel says, I bet the issue was at the main relay station that services your street.

365
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,440
The last time I was having a bunch of issues, the problem was at the junction box. And I bet,

366
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,640
you're right, either these people had the same problem or they had some other type of problem

367
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,720
that caused them to go open the box. And that took down the internet for an hour on

368
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,280
Wednesday. And then when it came up, magically worked again. So the most frustrating part of it,

369
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:31,480
I mean, Comcast has been actually messaging me on social media. And they're really good

370
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:36,040
about responding to you on social media if you have problems. Because I didn't even tag them,

371
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,480
but they were like, hi, how can we help? Because they saw me bitching. So they were like, hi,

372
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,680
how can we help? And so I sent private messages and they've been really good about responding

373
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,680
and all that. But the problem is, because I kind of did it that way, to be fair, they don't know

374
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,400
what the fuck happened. So it's like, I will never know why the internet went down. Y'all have some

375
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:56,680
great theories and you might be right. You're probably right. But I don't a hundred percent

376
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,360
know any of you are right. We will never a hundred percent know the reason why.

377
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,680
I had issues where like our internet would drop for hours or whatever, and there'd always be like,

378
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:12,680
you know, text in the area working on something. Eventually it fixes itself. It's dumb shit.

379
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:17,400
Now I need to see what kind of credit I get for my upload not working. I think they already gave

380
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:25,320
me like a $20 credit. I'll get nothing and I'll like it. Here's the other funny thing. Actually,

381
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:31,080
the tech, this is not to derail into cable talk, but all you internet nerds have these

382
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,840
same problems. Admit it. So the second tech was out here and he was looking at the problem.

383
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,360
And then he looked at our TV thing. He's like that. And he points at the box that we were using

384
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,840
is like, that is so old. We don't even support these anymore. Like, why do you still have this?

385
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,400
And I was like, cause that's how often we watch TV and I don't know why we're paying for it.

386
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,240
I do know why we pay for it. So I can watch RuPaul's drag race on my computer,

387
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,000
basically through the Xfinity.com and all cause you can watch cable on your computer.

388
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,920
You know what I do, which is what it's like. I pay for basic cable and I don't have the box

389
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:05,720
hooked up. It's in a box. Cause you can use your computer. Cause, cause guess what they wanted to

390
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:12,760
pay. They want me to pay for HD content. Where is I can just go online and watch that same HD

391
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:18,280
content for no additional money. So you know what I got out of this whole thing. I got a new TV box.

392
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,440
That's like a third of the size. Alan will watch TV once in a great while. Once in a great while,

393
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,440
he's like, I'm going to go pet the kitty on the couch and watch CNN or something. And that's,

394
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:33,080
but like I barely use, I'm I know I'm overpaying for cable, but well,

395
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,440
are you in the United States? Yes. Then you're overpaying for cable.

396
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:45,080
True. True. All right. Anyway, uh, let's see, going to chat at live.punknetwork.com.

397
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,920
Uh, Dungeon Buster says I got the same reply when I returned a box that stopped working.

398
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,720
Wow. I don't think we carry those anymore here. Have a new one. Um, Ray Sheeter says the credit

399
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,800
will come in the form of Comcast giving you two middle fingers and a flaming bag of poop.

400
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,040
You know, here's the thing though, for all Comcast issues, like I think Comcast knows they have a bad

401
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:06,440
customer service rat because I will say with the exception of the first tech who is out here,

402
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,800
who I wasn't here when he was here. So I'm getting all the secondhand through Alan,

403
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,360
but everybody that I interacted with was like super nice and went out of their way to be like,

404
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,720
Oh, it doesn't still work. I'm so sorry to hear that. Let's see what we can do. It's not,

405
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:22,440
it's not that we, nobody wanted to say, well, can't fix it. Nobody's mad at like

406
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,560
the customer service or anything. They're mad at the CEOs. It used to be that it used to be

407
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,400
that way where everybody was like, God, those people over there are assholes. Uh,

408
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,600
yeah. Some of their customer service in the past has been terrible because like,

409
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,120
yeah, I remember talking to them and they're like, yeah, you could just pay less and you get,

410
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,760
you know, faster speeds and you plus you get TV and stuff and then sure enough, you know,

411
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,840
Oh, Hey, wait a second. Why is this bill more expensive than what I was paying for before?

412
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,720
Oh, because that guy was a fucking liar is what it was. Oh, okay.

413
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:57,640
Uh, anyway. All right. So anyways, sorry. Long enough deviation on my internet problems,

414
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,720
but I bet, you know what, somebody out there, you're going to have the same problem eventually.

415
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,240
Like this is just, everything's going to the internet. I think less and less people

416
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,080
even using their TV. I think it's funny that I use my computer to do what the TV would do,

417
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:13,240
but that's where my 4k monitor is. So I want to watch stuff in 4k go on my computer.

418
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:19,480
Anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about, uh, uh, other announcements, which I really don't

419
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,720
have anything as far as like upcoming shows off or anything. You know, I almost, I will tell you

420
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:28,440
this. You guys might think this is funny. I was originally, when I came back from dragon con,

421
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,320
I was originally going to take tonight off so I could go to Folsom street fair, which I haven't

422
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:39,000
been to in like 15 years. Cause that was this weekend. Um, and I'm not talking about a street

423
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,600
fair in the city of Folsom. I'm talking about the other one. Uh, because I, my friends always

424
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,880
talk about it as a good time and I haven't been in so long. I was like, Oh, sure. I'll go.

425
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,760
But because we had that show after dragon con that we had to call off, I was like,

426
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,320
I don't want to take another show off. So that's why I'm here. So anyway, uh, we don't have any

427
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,240
shows off planned for a little bit, but next week on the show, I don't even know if you know this

428
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,640
Loki, I'm very excited about this next week on the show, we're gonna have a guest in studio.

429
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:12,120
My friend Delvin is going to be here from Toronto and he is the host of a show called video game

430
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:17,640
realness, which you can check out on iTunes. Yes. And, uh, well, because I also co-host

431
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,160
reading is fundamental. The drag race podcast. I haven't talked a lot about on this show

432
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:26,680
because it's not my show. I'm the host on psychic show, but it's there. And I also,

433
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,200
I don't know how many of you that listen to this would enjoy that, but if you like drag race,

434
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:35,480
go check it out. Reading is fundamental. Um, so he's going to be here in studio, so that's going

435
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,280
to be a good time. So, uh, very excited to have him and welcoming him to the show next week. I

436
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:46,680
can't believe that's only a week away. Oh, all right. Uh, let's get into other gaming news.

437
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,920
There's a lot going on, lots of conventions, not just the street fair on Folsom street,

438
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:56,360
but other conventions going on, right? Yes. That's right. Mine caught or my mine coughed mine craft.

439
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,160
I thought you said my cock and I'm like, no, that's my cost. That's what happened. That's

440
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,200
what's happening at Folsom right now. No, uh, Minecraft earth was this weekend. So they did

441
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,840
a big live stream. I didn't watch it. I just caught the highlights because they waste way

442
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:15,240
too much time with a bunch of streamers that I don't even know about or care about. This is more

443
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,880
of like a thing that my kids might be interested in, but I don't know. So they did make some

444
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:28,680
announcements. Um, so starting off, there was some new stuff coming in a, I am not sure what

445
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,760
the next update's called. Um, cause I know the last one was aquatic, but they're going to be

446
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:38,920
having some new stuff that has to do with the villagers. Um, lots of focus on that. So for

447
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:47,000
example, with the villages, now they're going to be getting new biome, um, like new biome related

448
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,640
architecture. So like stuff that's in the desert is going to kind of like desert architecture stuff

449
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,480
that's in the jungle is going to look a little bit more jungle-y, you know, that type of stuff.

450
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:59,080
The jungle is going to be more jungle-y. Is that what you said? No, the buildings. Cause right now

451
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,240
the buildings are all the same. So like they're going to have, you can just see the patch notes,

452
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,800
jungles are more jungle. Like in the desert, for example, they have like, like a street market

453
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,560
set up and they have like little kiosks and stuff like that. And the villagers are dressed

454
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:16,040
differently. Can't wait to go and wait. That's great that we're talking about the future of

455
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:22,040
Minecraft, but where is the fucking 4k pack that they announced like over a year ago at E3,

456
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:27,960
where's the super dude? And yes, I am going to bitch about Minecraft in 4k. Leave me alone.

457
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,240
It looks great with the, the, uh, if you want your Minecraft in 4k, you're just going to have

458
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:41,000
to play the Java version is what you're going to have to do. So, but you know what? And then along

459
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
with that, they're also, they have, um, new, Oh, so yeah, the next Minecraft update is going to

460
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,720
be called the village and pillage update. So, cause they have pillagers now, which are villagers

461
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,480
that attack villages and they have like these beasts that are with them as well. So you can

462
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:01,400
those off. Um, pandas are going to be in the game. Cool. They have a crossbow, which is pretty

463
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,160
awesome. Wait, the pandas have a crossbow. No, you have a crossbow. I think the pandas should

464
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:11,880
have a crossbow. What do y'all they pandas with crossbows? Yes or yes. Um, then of course, you

465
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:18,200
know, they're going to have, um, the new scripting API is going to be coming soon. Uh, they're saying

466
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:23,320
that they're going to be, is that so you can program the pandas to hunt people. Yes. So you

467
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,480
can do that. And they also have animations that you can give you more customization options.

468
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:33,640
Um, you can add particles and stuff to your different creatures and stuff. They released

469
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:40,440
a new piece of content called inspiration Island, which is as big like Minecraft theme park type

470
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,720
thing that you can go download for free inspiration Island sounds like a church retreat. Sorry.

471
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,480
Well, there are people flying kind of religiously. So maybe it is, I don't know.

472
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,920
They're fairly safe. They're feeling, but this, this though is right up your alley, Rob

473
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,720
Minecraft dungeons, a dungeon crawler game. Yes. I heard about this. It sounds awesome. Tell me more.

474
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:08,040
Yes. So, uh, Minecraft dungeons is Diablo Minecraft basically. Yeah. Set the same set

475
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,840
in the same universe. Uh, they didn't really show too much as far as gameplay goes. Oh,

476
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:18,280
I mean, it looks, it looks like it's going to be, you know, like a hack and slash

477
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,960
Diablo type game. So child's first Diablo type of thing. Sign me. What do you mean child's

478
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,880
first Diablo? Sign me the fuck up. This sounds great kids. If I want to get my kids into Diablo,

479
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:33,640
you know? Oh, I see. So it's, it's Diablo without the Satan imagery and with, with, uh,

480
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:38,360
Minecraft, cute, cutesy stuff instead. Yes. And pandas with crossbows. Of course.

481
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:45,560
Awesome. You know, with mods, you can do anything. I know you can make those pandas have crossbows.

482
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:50,840
I know. Or, or as a rage hater in chat says, pandas with crossbows that shoot tiny pandas

483
00:39:51,960 --> 00:40:01,560
have even tinier crossbows. Absolutely. Oh man. Yes. I need to set up that. We,

484
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,080
we talked about doing a Minecraft server and then dragon con kind of threw everything off.

485
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:09,720
We were gone to the realms. Yeah. Yeah. We'd still need to look at setting that up. So it'd be fun.

486
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,400
But now that's, that's the thing I want on our realm is pandas with crossbows. Can you do that?

487
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,720
Not yet. Cause the updates not out yet. I see. When do we have a date for the update?

488
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:22,120
No. Okay. Well look forward to the, uh, VOG presents Panda with crossbow.

489
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:26,520
They have like still like they haven't, I don't think they've released the mob that was

490
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:31,320
unveiled in the last mine con earth. So there's still a little behind with things,

491
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,720
but now cause cause you do in chat says they already have a Minecraft dungeon crawler. It's

492
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:41,640
called fight the dragon. It's on steam. So, I mean, clearly other developers have probably

493
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,560
taken the cutesy graphics of Minecraft idea and merged it with the dungeon crawler.

494
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:50,360
I'm sure there is a rogue like with Minecraft graphics and I'm sure there is a battle royale

495
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:56,520
game with mine. So indie developers have come up with it because you know, that type of art style

496
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:01,960
is perfect for people like me that can't draw or, well, okay. It's funny. I used to be able to draw

497
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,840
then I stopped drawing for a very long time. And funny enough, you lose your talent when you stop

498
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:13,000
and don't practice something for a long, long, long time. Um, so unfortunately my art skills

499
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,520
on the PC are not as good as they used to be. And so that's what I'm stuck with is Minecraft type

500
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:26,200
art. Uh, going to chat, uh, Bobby Blackwell says, do you think we'll have pandas or 4k first pandas?

501
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:33,960
How about 4k pandas? I'm going to tweet them right now. 4,000 pandas. When I'm tweeting them right

502
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:43,560
now, could y'all retweet and fave when 4k pandas, and then the people listening on the, uh, podcast

503
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:50,120
feed will be like, oh, that's why they tweeted that all of a sudden. I wonder what, um, was,

504
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,040
I don't even remember what it was called. It wasn't the 4k update. It was like the,

505
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:02,120
um, better graphics or I don't remember was not better to get. I, what did they call it? Like,

506
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,200
it was like supposedly like something like it had to make a name. Maybe it was the 4k update.

507
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,680
No, it was like the super duper deluxe graphics pack or something. They used a lot of like silly

508
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,720
names in the, in the title of that super duper 4k graphics pack. That's it.

509
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:24,120
I was close. So let's see. Here we go. Here's an article that was a couple months ago.

510
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:29,120
Let's see what it says about, about the 4k updates. Um,

511
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:38,360
thank you for your patience. Love Microsoft. That's it. Yeah. It doesn't really say it says,

512
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:45,560
um, it's possibly pushed back to 2019. We don't know. So it's all speculation. They don't know

513
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:50,600
vid power and chat says 4k blocky graphics is the future. You're damn right. But it was

514
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:55,560
like about the blocks. It's about the water, the sunset, like if you want, it does look good.

515
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,440
Go look at it. Like I tried to get like, and it's funny cause I have a graphics card that's

516
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:05,960
truly capable of doing this crap. Yet for some reason, you know, it doesn't want to play nice

517
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,240
with the newest version of Minecraft on the Java version. So I can't get, I have,

518
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:17,800
I can't get the 4k like type stuff working like the, um, uh, Sonic ether.

519
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:24,520
Was it Sonic ether or, um, it's one of those that has like the fun texture waters and the

520
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:32,840
moving trees and stuff like that. But yeah, I don't know. It, it does look nice. I w I would

521
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:38,280
like that update to come out, but I'm not holding my breath. All right. Well, I'll let you know if

522
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:43,400
Minecraft replies to our tweet. All right. Cause you know, I'm sure that nobody else tweets them.

523
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,440
Any demands ever. Let's talk about Pokemon. Go Loki's favorite game right now. He's wearing

524
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:53,320
his gotcha on his wrist. I noticed. Is it running right now to get, um, it's not on right now.

525
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,560
Do you have, um, issues where the settings change on you like randomly?

526
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:04,360
Uh, if I have it in my pocket and I accidentally am hitting that little button without realizing

527
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:11,160
it. Yes. I don't ever have it in my pocket. No, I don't know what's up with that. You know,

528
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:16,680
there's an app you can, I have the app and that's what I use, but like I'll notice like I set it to

529
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,320
basically I have it, you know, set the auto catch everything. Sure. But I turn the settings off on

530
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,440
the notifications on in my app depending on what amount of regular pokey balls I have. No, I don't

531
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:31,240
know what's up with that. And so like, I'll like have it auto spin the pokey stops and I'll notice

532
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:35,480
it won't spin it and it's giving me the indicator. Oh yeah. Tap the button twice to spin the boogies.

533
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,440
I'm like, I fucking told you the auto spin this shit. What the fuck? And then I go into the app.

534
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,720
It's like, Oh yeah, we turn that off. And then like, you know, it'll be auto catch unknowns and

535
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,200
it's like, Oh, sorry. You know, that's turned off too. It's like, what the fuck? So now every

536
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,640
time I started, I have to check to make sure the same. They're correct. Interesting. No,

537
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,880
I don't know what's causing that. So speaking of unknowns, do you have one yet? No, I need to trade

538
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,840
you one from dragon con. I need them out of my inventory. Take one. Okay. All right. We're like

539
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:07,240
three star friends, right? The start, it's only like 1600 stars. It's like four star friends.

540
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,920
Yeah. We're getting closer. I actually, so for Pokemon go, I didn't talk about it during my

541
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,800
game a week, but I hit a best friends with three people this week. One of them is act deft, um,

542
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:20,440
who, uh, is there in the chat. So we actually hit four stars. And the nice thing is I was able to

543
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:25,480
time the lucky egg every time. So I hit it with my friend, Kyle in Canada. I hit it with act theft.

544
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,880
And then my friend, John here locally, who I used to live with when we were doing OLR,

545
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,800
uh, when we were on Justin TV, he was my roommate during that period. So we all hit four star

546
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:40,200
friends and I had my lucky egg going each time and I got 600 K XP from that crazy eyes on, um,

547
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:48,760
Friday I walked six miles. Wow. Yeah. I'll never do that again. That was too, that was too far.

548
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:54,920
Cause you know, were you trying to get a mime and a Kangaskhan that bad? Um, I did get a, I did get

549
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:01,960
a, um, no, I didn't get him. I think I have a, my, I got a, um, far-fetched not far-fetched

550
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:10,280
Toros. Um, the one that's dressed up like a woman. I don't remember the tangela. No, no,

551
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:15,560
I've got one of those. Mr. Mime is a little, not mr mime. It's uh, the other jinx. I got a jinx.

552
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:19,240
Finally. I didn't have a jinx. Oh, okay. That's not one of the rare ones though. But, um,

553
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:26,200
no, I have a tangela. I have a few of those, but yeah, it's, um, but I was just surprised

554
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,840
like, cause I, I, I forget that kilometers aren't as far as miles. And so like, yeah,

555
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:34,280
that's like 10 kilometers right there. Well, as far as the walking event goes, uh,

556
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,640
one thing that is worth saying about Pokemon go, something I want to talk about was that

557
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,480
they just put out a tweet today. It says they have extended that until October 8th.

558
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:46,600
So if you have not hatched your mr mime and your, uh, Kangaskhan that was supposed to end today,

559
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:50,440
but they extended it through October 8th, probably because they're selling incubators and all that

560
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,640
crap like crazy. I've been trying, I've been putting in seven K eggs all the time. Whenever

561
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:01,000
I get, it's a low, the thing is it's a low, low dropper. It's like a 2% drop rate for a Kanga or

562
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,720
a mime. No, I think Kanga is at 5% and mime is at two for some weird reason. There there's a chart

563
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:10,440
on silph road, which is a great Reddit for Pokemon go. If you're not, uh, it's the silph road on

564
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:15,480
Reddit. It's a great resource. Yeah. I walked, I walked, you know, cause you kind of know the

565
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,360
area where my work is. So I walked all the way. I walked over the freeway cause they have that

566
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:25,560
walking trail. It's over the freeway. I walked all the way from there all the way down the Kilgore.

567
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:29,480
I went to the KP market on the way there and I went all the way down the Kilgore and it came

568
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:35,000
all the way back. That is very far. That is six miles. Wow. Okay. Well, you know what? Like,

569
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,560
I got to say that I'll give Pokemon go this like, you know, despite how ridiculous this egg event

570
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,160
has been, even though I'm over it now, cause I have three Kangas and three mimes. So I've

571
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,520
that I have also been doing a shit ton of walking because of it. You know what I do?

572
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:52,920
I don't even use, use the gotcha because you know what credits walking better than anything,

573
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:58,520
the watch. And it's the only thing that fucking watch app does decently. So I'll start my watch.

574
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:03,080
I have an Apple watch and I'll start my, my walking and I'll do it. And it tracks very,

575
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,360
and I can look anytime, see how much further I have to go. And it pushes me to walk more.

576
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:13,240
So I got to say, if nothing else, you know what this game is like gamifying, walking and exercise

577
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:18,840
in a way that everybody walks on the Nintendo DS. What was that? Never did. It was for me.

578
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:23,800
It's my Fitbit. My Fitbits really motivated me to walk every day in like three months. Cause I

579
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:28,360
walked, I do the three miles walking during lunch cause I can't do anymore. Cause that it's a really

580
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:33,960
long time. I just, I got away with it on Friday because most of my team was gone. And so it's

581
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,080
like, no one knows when I leave for lunch and no one knows when I come back, no one's paying

582
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:45,400
attention. So I was able to walk for two hours, but, uh, you know, it's just three miles a day

583
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:50,280
though. And then I do DDR at home. I mean, it's killer. Like my feet are just absolutely killing

584
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:56,440
me at the end of the day. But, but then I have so many calories, eat things I want to eat and then,

585
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,680
but I don't even eat all that stuff. And I didn't have tons of calories. I lost three pounds this

586
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,520
last week, I think, or this week. Good for you working on it. Just don't overdo it. Like I said,

587
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,800
I told you, I complimented you last week. It's noticeable. Uh, anyway,

588
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,840
Brad from pop culture says there needs to be trading with long distance friends.

589
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:15,640
I will say what is kind of cool though, is that the eggs still come from the place that they were

590
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:21,160
sent from. So like one of my Kangas cons is a Mexican Kangas con thanks to act deaf because

591
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,720
he had sent that egg, which opened up and ended up being a Kangas con. Uh, one of my Mr. Mimes

592
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:30,840
actually the third Mr. Mime I opened is from Atlanta. So I know three people in Atlanta.

593
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:35,720
So that egg either came from Bobby Black Wolf, his wife, or Charles from the Pokemon go podcast.

594
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:39,800
I don't think, you know, which I need two more friends. I added Alan. I still need two more

595
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,720
friends for that stupid quest. Put your code in chat. They'll help you out. I will.

596
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,760
By the way, Curtis told me he got like a flutter request. Thank you guys very much. I appreciate

597
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:54,520
that. Oh yeah. I need to add him. I forgot. There you go. Scroll up and chat. I saw Curtis last

598
00:49:54,520 --> 00:50:00,360
night cause um, his, his boyfriend was having a um, a birthday party and uh, I said, so how

599
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:04,360
many people did you get from your phrase? Like, Oh my God, I have so many. So I was like, yay.

600
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:10,440
So there you go. Anyway, that made me laugh. Uh, somebody just joined chat to say, I will add you.

601
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,040
So get that code in the chat. Your problems will be over. You'll get, you'll get play. I have a lot

602
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:21,000
of people that, you know, listen to us already. So I was just, you know, Well, it's nice. It's

603
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,280
nice to know there's actually people out there and I will send you gifts. I have tons of gifts.

604
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,520
Like I will not. I'm horrible at sending gifts and I was gonna say, I didn't get to finish my

605
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:33,560
thought, but I said, Charles from the Pokemon go podcast adore him, but he's really bad with gifts

606
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:37,160
and I understand why he's the host of the Pokemon go podcast. I'm sure he has 200 friends. He has

607
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:42,360
max friends list. So I don't think the, in fact, I'm pretty sure the egg that the Mr. Mime was in

608
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:48,360
did not come from him. It had to have been Bobby or Jennifer. So it was one of one of the two of

609
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:54,120
them. Um, and actually I think it was Jennifer because Bobby's gifts usually come from not

610
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,480
Atlanta. They come from a different city, which I don't know if he wants me to say on there,

611
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:04,120
but he tends to send them from another city. So, um, yeah, there you go. Anyway. Um,

612
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:10,200
that was where I, so I like that, that the eggs are labeled with where, what friend basically

613
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,320
said, I'll just read it out on air. So if anybody's listening and it's not in chat,

614
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:19,000
we can do that. So my friend code seven, two, four, six, seven, six, four, four,

615
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,080
one, five, six, three. And I've already, Oh, and they're in chat as well.

616
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,200
I'll add people now. Okay. So all right. You're brave. I won't, no, no offense, but I won't give

617
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,680
my code out on air. Like you can ask for it, but I'm just like, when you ask for it, I'm going to

618
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,680
give you my disclaimer that I'm really shitty with gift giving. Cause I just don't like today.

619
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,720
I have been like, like lazy all that. I haven't left the fucking house yet,

620
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,320
which I kind of need to do cause I need to go spin a pokey stop to get my street going. But like,

621
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:51,960
I haven't gotten a single gift today to send out. So Sundays are just my lazy day.

622
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:57,720
Yeah. And Brad, I've already got you. So, all right. All right. Anyhow. Uh,

623
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:02,280
what I really wanted to talk about before we turned into a Pokemon go podcast. No, it's fine.

624
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:07,080
There's a lot. Pokemon go is still popular. Uh, but one thing that we were talking about last

625
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:12,840
week because these little nuttos, as people were calling him, the little nut things with

626
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:18,760
the nut for a head that would, and I'm talking about an ACE hardware store, not the dirty thing.

627
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:23,800
So yes, they did not have testicles for heads. It had a little ACE hardware nut for a head. And

628
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,720
then like maybe like a diddly body and you would catch it. The real question though is

629
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:36,040
has someone put the Royal crown on this thing yet? Shut up. Anyway. So, uh, the deal is that

630
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:41,320
Pokemon was officially unveiled this week with the real name. It's not called nutto. It's called

631
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:46,920
meltan is the actual name of that. Uh, and it is going to be a mythical Pokemon. So it's kind of

632
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,080
interesting that those are out in the wild because I would think you were going to catch that, uh,

633
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,920
through like a quest line or something in Pokemon go, but we'll see. They're still out there too.

634
00:52:54,920 --> 00:53:00,120
The meltans are still out there. I've noticed because the other day, because I had my thing

635
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,320
catching Pokemon as I'm walking and stuff. And I looked at the other day, I'm like,

636
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:08,280
why do I have 12 dittos? That's too many dittos. I don't need this many.

637
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,560
Yeah. It's those dumb things. Well, if you're still stuck on that new quest,

638
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:15,160
like you've just come back, like it's act, this is like the best thing that's going to happen.

639
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,440
Yeah. Cause you find those. Yeah. Before they started this event with all the, you know,

640
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,160
uh, ghastlies out there is like, Oh, catch ghost Pokemon. And it's like, now it's like,

641
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:29,080
ah, that's no problem. Yeah. So anyway, um, so meltan is officially unveiled and it will be,

642
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:35,560
uh, in a new po- it was unveiled in a Pokemon let's go trailer. So that is the new Pokemon

643
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:39,720
that is going to be added to the Kanto Pokemon. Because again, if you weren't already aware,

644
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:44,200
Pokemon let's go Pikachu and let's go Eevee is only going to future. At least for now. I don't

645
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,440
know if they plan to expand it in the future, but only the gen one Pokemon, but they always tease,

646
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:54,200
there would be one more Pokemon that is a brand new Pokemon also in it. And it is meltan. So

647
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:59,000
it's kind of lame though. Well, it's, it is kind of neat though. Like kind of like Jason

648
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,240
said in tonight's intro that basically Pokemon go is now that established part of the cannon

649
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:12,520
where they have unveiled something that will affect the game boy games in the Pokemon go,

650
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:17,880
uh, or, uh, not Pokemon go Pokemon. Let's go. You can actually increase the stats of your Pokemon

651
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:22,600
that you have there too. So you can actually build those up to like a hundred percent or whatever,

652
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:30,200
which is nice. Be, and also you will be able to send Pokemon from your Pokemon go into the

653
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:36,040
switch. Let's go, but it will not go the other way. So if you weren't, if you're not already

654
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:41,080
aware, it is a one way street. You send your poacher. I'm positive because that's, they don't

655
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:46,760
want you to level all your stuff up and let's go and then send it back to Pokemon go. You'd be at,

656
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,960
you'd throw off the balance of the game because I thought that was the whole point. I thought that

657
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:54,280
you could store it like in the Poke ball or whatever and then you like walk and stuff and

658
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:58,680
it levels it up and you can send it back. It's kind of a glow. Yeah, but you can't put it in

659
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:03,640
Pokemon go is what I'm saying. And the Pokemon, basically that Poke ball is a glorified Pokemon

660
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,160
go plus. I mean it, it will do a couple extra things. It sounds like too, but it's basically

661
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:12,120
a glorified Pokemon go plus. All right, cool. Got my three friends. Yeah. Nice. Here you go.

662
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,960
I just have the evolve a grass type and evolve and evolved grass type of one. Yeah. That would

663
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:21,800
have been great last week. That just means like a Venusaur. I know. I know he means you have to

664
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:25,960
find one of them. Oh yeah. Why didn't you do a new chicory today? You should. Well, right. I

665
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:31,000
didn't have been chicory today. Well, that's fine. I have tons of bubble sores and stuff.

666
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,440
All right. And I was gonna say, just get the candy and evolve the second form or whatever

667
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:40,760
takes a hundred candy. Anyway. Yeah. All right. Um, moving on. That's plenty of Pokemon go talk.

668
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,720
Let's move on. Loki. You've hinted at this a bunch, which you're about to talk about.

669
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:48,520
We've already kind of brushed this topic because Microsoft officially said officially

670
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:54,920
said something on this. So they were working with razor, um, to help add support for keyboard and

671
00:55:54,920 --> 00:56:01,400
mouse to games on the Xbox one. And so now they're enabling keyboard mouse support on Xbox one for

672
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:06,840
select Xbox insiders for the next few weeks. And then, um, right now it's going to be a game by

673
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:11,160
game thing. Developers bill to choose whether they want to implement it or not. That's pretty

674
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:16,120
cool that they're going to do that. And he said most wired and wireless keyboards and mice will

675
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:21,960
work on the Xbox one, which yeah, I would think so. It's just a keyword, a mouse. I mean, I can't

676
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,680
imagine a keyboard mouse that wouldn't work. Um, and then of course they're going to also have

677
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:30,840
maybe some razor gear that's going to have the Xbox logo on or something like that. But

678
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:37,080
it's interesting in somewhat like this. It makes me think unless, you know, of course they disable

679
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:43,320
it. But, um, you know, like Fortnite or not Fortnite, but, um, I guess the Fortnite would still

680
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:47,800
work too, but I would think that you would want to differentiate this person's on a keyboard mouse,

681
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:52,040
this person's in, you know, on controller. Kind of like I was mentioning about the,

682
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:58,280
what DDR used to do. Yeah. So, so I don't know. Um, that's going to be very interesting if, uh,

683
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:02,760
they start kind of allowing, I mean, it's weird because like PlayStation four already allows

684
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:08,280
keyboard and mouse, but so few games on certain games. Yeah. It's basic. The only one I can think

685
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:12,760
of is Final Fantasy 14. I don't know anything else that uses keyboard and mouse. And what's funny is

686
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:18,200
that back on the Xbox 360, I used to play Final Fantasy 11 with a keyboard on 360. So it's weird

687
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,960
to me that Xbox one, like we haven't been talking about keyboard and mouse, but we're talking about

688
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:25,880
more than just MMOs. We're talking about like using a keyboard and mouse to play first person

689
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:30,280
shooters, which I don't think any of these things have ever done. See, this is this right here is

690
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:36,200
a perfect point. It's like, this doesn't seem like that big a deal, but you think about it. I mean,

691
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:42,840
this is basically, it's like Microsoft is listening to their users. Like, yeah,

692
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:47,000
this is why we have backwards compatibility. This is why we have cross play. This is why we have mod

693
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,920
support. This is why we have keyboard and mouse now it's because they're listening to what people

694
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:57,080
want and they're giving them what they want, which I got to tell you, it goes a long way, you know,

695
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:02,920
towards when it comes to that next console, you're going to be thinking about, okay,

696
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:07,240
do I want the console that, you know, got its head up its ass because they think they're the

697
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:11,640
greatest thing on, you know, the earth. And, but yet they don't support these things. Where am I

698
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:16,600
going to pick this other console that has more support towards user-generated stuff and more

699
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:21,800
things that fans have been asking for? Because right now it used to be a performance issue

700
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,880
between the 360 and like the PlayStation 3, whereas the games would perform better on the

701
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:32,600
360, which is weird. Why did I get a PlayStation 4? But I don't know. And then exclusive games,

702
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:37,000
I guess, you know, but is that really all you play is exclusive games? No,

703
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:43,640
you play mostly cross platform games and, you know, which system is it going to play better on?

704
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:51,000
I don't know. All right. Well, yeah, I mean, with that whole thing, because I'm looking at chat,

705
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,680
Orange Right says I could see people complaining about people having an advantage with keyboard

706
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:58,680
and mouse though over controller. Well, haven't we now opened that box thanks to cross play?

707
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:02,920
I mean, the cross play you fought so hard for on PlayStation 4, now you're going to be playing

708
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:08,440
against PC people who are using keyboard and mouse, right? So this is something we kind of

709
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:15,480
have to figure out now, I think. So we'll see. Anyway, let's move on and talk about Nintendo

710
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:19,400
online cloud saves. Now we've talked about this a little bit already in the past about this whole

711
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:24,520
system, but it was clarified this week that the cloud saves are going to be, and of course now my

712
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:29,320
site isn't loading, but I believe the cloud saves are going to be there for six months. So if you

713
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:33,320
were a panic that Nintendo was going to delete your save, as soon as you let your Nintendo online

714
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:37,880
account expire, Nintendo did clarify that it's still going to be there for six months. I still

715
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:43,400
think many people would like to know that they could do a physical backup of some sort of those.

716
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:47,480
And I think that's what people would really like to be able to do is just like use a USB stick,

717
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:52,040
you know, kind of like the other consoles that you do. But at this time, at least it's not going

718
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:55,960
to be that your cloud saves are just going to disappear the first day anyway. So at least we

719
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:01,720
know that much, right? Yes, this is, I think, reasonable. This is basically putting them in

720
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:07,720
alignment with other services. So I'm completely fine with this now. Yeah. I mean, this is really

721
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:11,720
how they should have done it from the get go. And I'm glad it didn't take them very long to

722
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:18,280
realize that this is probably something they should do. Yeah. Anyhow, also, a little talk

723
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:23,640
about Virtual Console has slipped out there. And again, my site isn't loading, but I'm going off

724
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:29,720
of what I remember of this story is that they had said that there was in the files for the eShop,

725
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:34,040
I think, had recently been updated. And in those files for the eShop were references to Virtual

726
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:38,680
Console. So people were going crazy going, oh, my gosh, it's going to be Virtual Console. But

727
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,520
there's thought that they might have just copied over some type of master database file from the

728
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:47,400
3DS. So this might not quite be what you think it is. Yeah. So basically, a switch to Datamire

729
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:53,240
notice that switch eShop JSON file had just been updated and now contains references to

730
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:59,880
the terms Virtual Console, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance and DS.

731
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:03,240
And now there's two way. They basically said there's two ways to look at this. Perhaps

732
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:09,400
it's just a carryover from the 3DS or on the other hand, maybe it's just something to hint

733
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,640
that there's a Virtual Console service coming on the switch. Well, Nintendo hasn't said anything

734
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:20,520
about Super Nintendo or GameCube. Well, actually, what I think this would really be for would be

735
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:26,040
Wii and GameCube. I think if we're going to go, why wouldn't they just sell the freaking Wii games

736
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:30,680
like they were doing on Wii U for a little bit? Why not sell those full functional games? Maybe

737
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:35,640
though, since there's no infrared bar, maybe it's not as easy as I think it is. Although wouldn't

738
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:39,560
those controllers be able to emulate the function, but they couldn't tell where you were pointing,

739
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:44,840
could they? Because there's no infrared sensor. It would be very difficult. Yeah.

740
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:50,040
Some games would work that didn't maybe use the infrared. So like, you know, you could do like

741
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:54,520
an excite truck or something like that, but then you would need to. And also there's, you remember,

742
01:01:54,520 --> 01:02:01,480
there's the games that they had on the Nvidia Shield in Korea or China or wherever the hell it

743
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:07,800
was where they actually had Wii games. And some of those did work. Like I can't remember. I don't

744
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,560
remember how they got around. I think what they did as far as like the pointer stuff, they just

745
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:16,760
use the second analog stick as the pointer on the screen. So you just would have like a cursor or

746
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:21,480
something like that. So maybe that would work, but it's not going to work for all games, but not

747
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:26,920
every single game use motion controls either. So it may work for some things. Okay. Good to know.

748
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:31,400
All right. Well, let's move on just a couple more stories before we get to the classic game

749
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:38,920
of the week. Loki. All right. So PlayStation is not going to be doing a PlayStation experience

750
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:46,280
for 2018. They are going to be skipping 2018 and waiting until next year. So they said for 2018,

751
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:49,000
I know this is going to be a disappointment for some people, but we decided not to hold

752
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:56,360
the PlayStation experience this year. We wouldn't have had enough to bring people all together in

753
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:01,080
some location in North America to even have an event. We don't want to set the expectations

754
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:08,120
really high and then not deliver on it. So interesting that they're not going to be doing

755
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:12,280
anything. I mean, I guess it makes sense. They kind of released a bunch of stuff already. Maybe

756
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:20,200
the other stuff that they showed is just not ready yet. But guess what? Microsoft has your back

757
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:28,680
because they've got XO 18 coming November 10th and 11th to Mexico City. So it's going to be the

758
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:35,480
fourth annual Xbox Fan Fest. So PlayStation is not having a fan fest, but Microsoft is.

759
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:41,560
And it's interesting about the Microsoft one is it's not in the U.S., Europe. They're having it

760
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:46,360
in Mexico. So it's kind of interesting how Microsoft is trying to appeal to a broader

761
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:51,160
global community. Yeah. Kind of what that says to me. And then, of course, they're going to show

762
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:56,040
they said they're going to have the largest Inside Xbox episode ever. During that time,

763
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:00,280
there's going to be some first looks and surprise live streams. And they're going to be doing some

764
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:05,640
coverage through Mixer throughout that weekend. So basically, they'll be doing some announcements,

765
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,880
maybe. I mean, I don't know how high you want to set the bar, but maybe akin to

766
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:15,800
what they were doing at PSX when they were doing PSX in the winter. Remember how they would do

767
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:20,840
quite some big unveiling at that expo and maybe they just didn't have the unveiling this year.

768
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:26,440
What do you think caused Sony to say not this year? Maybe they just had a lot of maybe they

769
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:31,640
just released a bunch of games and so they don't really have like maybe The Last of Us 2 and

770
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,920
the other games that they were showing off at E3 are just not.

771
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:39,240
I mean, I guess they could do the E3 demos and stuff, but they didn't want to recycle

772
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:45,960
the same thing. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Let's see. Going to chat at live.vognetwork.com

773
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:50,280
actdeft, who's in Mexico, but obviously Mexico is a very big place is in a very different part.

774
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:54,120
He says, I kind of want to go to the XO18 event, but it's too close to plan. And I have stuff to

775
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:59,800
do that weekend. So he probably want to get out there. It sounds like, but that's still kind of

776
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:05,800
neat that we'll have that convention and can watch a feed on. Hopefully the feed is in English or

777
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,960
we'll have subtitles or translate or something. Yeah, hopefully. So we can understand whatever

778
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,920
the announcements are. That would be pretty exciting. But I do find that very interesting

779
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:18,280
that maybe Microsoft's targeting a more global type of build. If they're losing the war in Japan,

780
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:23,080
why not try to win it in Latin America? You know, it's interesting. It's interesting. It's

781
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:29,160
interesting tactic. We'll see how it works. All right. Anyhow, let's talk about some more of the

782
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:36,680
fallout from Telltale's sudden closure. Stranger Things over on, which was a game that Telltale

783
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:41,000
was supposed to be doing for Netflix. Netflix has come out and said, they're still going to do it.

784
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,040
They're still moving ahead with the Stranger Things game. They said in a statement, we are

785
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:50,360
saddened by news about Telltale games. They develop many great games in the past and left

786
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:54,280
indelible mark on the industry. Minecraft story mode is still moving forward as planned. We are

787
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:58,760
in the process of evaluating other options for bringing the Stranger Things universe to life

788
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:03,400
in an interactive medium. So they're not letting that go. And did you see that tweet from Devolver?

789
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:08,360
Where Devolver was basically like, if you want to give it to us, we'll do it. And we'll hire

790
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:12,280
former Telltale devs to help. And they were, they already knew what studio would do it too.

791
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:18,200
Is there studio that did code or something? Yeah. No code. So, um, yeah, I thought that was very

792
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:22,280
interesting. So, uh, we'll see where this game ends up. And I think that would be very cool

793
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:28,360
if some, uh, Telltale people were able to get, get jobs, uh, uh, helping to build this. Although

794
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:32,120
I think that developer was in Europe. So some people may not want to uproot all the way to

795
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:35,880
Europe, but maybe, you know, something, maybe something can be workable. Who knows? Um,

796
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:41,720
other news about Telltale though, and this is the part that in some ways I think is more fascinating,

797
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:48,840
uh, just to me to kind of watch, like all this news kind of going out is because, um, so people

798
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:53,640
bought the full walking dead season in advance with the expectation that the walking dead

799
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:59,160
episode one, two, three, four, the final season would be released as they've always been. But

800
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:04,680
Telltale closed right before episode two came out. Episode two still came out because like,

801
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,640
it was the Friday before the Tuesday it was supposed to come out. So it was probably in

802
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:11,720
the box ready to go, so to speak. So episode two still came out, but we have no plan. We have no

803
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:15,880
word on how they're going to get episode three and four out, or if they will, because they basically

804
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:20,360
already sold this to some people. Uh, so some people are pissed off because essentially it's

805
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:25,240
stolen money. If these games disappear, it's basically stolen money. But on the flip side,

806
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:30,920
if Telltale were to continue to develop these games, which by the way is the statement from

807
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:35,720
Telltale that says, hi everyone, we have a walking dead update for you. Multiple potential partners

808
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:38,680
have stepped forward to express interest in helping to see the final season through to

809
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:42,440
completion. We can't make any promises today. We're actively working towards a solution

810
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:45,960
that will allow episodes three and four to be completed and released in some form.

811
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:49,800
In the meantime, episode two will release tomorrow across all platforms as planned.

812
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:55,080
We hope to have answers for your other questions soon. So, okay, either they're going to turn it

813
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:59,320
over to another developer who's expressed interest in buying it for a share of the profit or

814
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:02,840
something, or maybe they're going to outsource it. I don't know, but at the end of the day,

815
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:07,320
then you have to kind of look at it and go, okay, well, they're going to deliver on this thing that

816
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:12,280
they sold, but at what price? Because they fucked over their developers that they fired

817
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:18,920
without severance. There's a class action lawsuit now because yeah, I saw that too. So, um, but now

818
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:23,080
it's like, okay, so even if they get these games finished, the people that are going to get paid

819
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:27,160
for it, is it going to be the people who really put their heart and soul into the story story and

820
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:31,400
the people who made it, it doesn't seem like it will be because those people were not given any

821
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:37,960
types of severance. So in a way, it's almost better if Telltale just like fucking doesn't

822
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:43,080
do the followups and offers to refund the money, which they probably can't do. We all know they

823
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:48,360
can't do because of this bankruptcy, this sudden thing they've done. So the executives at Telltale

824
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:55,080
fuck the company pretty good. And unfortunately, fuck the customers, fuck their employees,

825
01:08:55,080 --> 01:09:01,560
and now, you know, who knows what's going to come of this? Who would have thought, you know,

826
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:06,120
at the beginning of the year, we'd be talking about Telltale like this, who would have thought?

827
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:10,680
I know it's crazy, right? Well, some people would have tell you this was a long time coming,

828
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:14,760
but that's neither here nor there. Anyway, apparently things haven't been running well

829
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:20,360
there for quite some time, but anyway, I'm not one to go. So anyway, let's, let's go back to a

830
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:24,760
time when you know what, it was just, it was, it was more nor there wasn't episodic games. There

831
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:30,440
was cartridge games and you got one. That's it. We're going to take a step back in time and we're

832
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:35,960
going to go way back in time. Thanks to radio magic and check out the classic game of the week.

833
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:44,440
And so we travel back in space and time to bring you the classic game of the week

834
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:48,840
where dark soccer is going to join us via Skype this week. Hi Jamie, how are you?

835
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:54,600
I'm all right. How are you? I'm good. You don't have to lie to the listeners. You've been under

836
01:09:54,600 --> 01:10:00,840
the weather. That can't be super good. Yeah. I have a sinus infection, which as usual,

837
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:07,480
it goes right into my lungs. Well, I'm glad you could fight all that to still join us

838
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:12,760
this week here on Orange Laundry to bring us the classic game of the week. Because as I always say,

839
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:17,000
you step into the gaming vault and find a game that you've been playing where you're like, Hey,

840
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:21,560
you brats play this game or I'm going to punch you in the face. So what is the classic game

841
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:28,120
of the week? Popeye. Yay. I love, I love this game. This is one of those games where

842
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:34,040
I was just, this is one of those games where how have we not done this game before?

843
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:40,760
I love this game. No idea, but I'm going to punch people the way that Popeye punches vultures

844
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:49,640
by eating some spinach. Although canned spinach is gross. True story. When I was a kid,

845
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:54,920
my mom used to buy the Popeye brand canned spinach so that my brothers and I would eat it.

846
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,920
Oh, I can't. Spinach is like the grossest way to do it.

847
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:05,960
It is totally gross, but it works when you're making lasagna though. And it works in this game.

848
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:13,400
Yes. So Popeye came out in 1983 and it was developed and released by Nintendo.

849
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:18,040
Of course, based on Popeye from King, a future syndicate.

850
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:29,480
As a platformer though, you couldn't jump, you had a punch button. So it also was licensed by

851
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:37,880
Atari to be released in the UK and Ireland. And it actually had an Atari cabinet for them as well.

852
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:47,000
It also was supposed to be eventually what became Donkey Kong. The characters were going to be used

853
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,080
in another game, but Nintendo couldn't get a license for it. So then Donkey Kong came around.

854
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:58,920
So into the actual gameplay, you have to collect a certain number of items that are

855
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:08,680
dropped by olive oil. 24 hearts, 16 music notes, or 24 letters in the word help. You have to avoid

856
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:16,520
the sea hag, Bluto or Brutus as he was in this one and other, you know, things. He walks back

857
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:20,840
and forth and up and down the stairs. They use a four-way joystick. There's a punch button,

858
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:29,400
but no jump button like in other games. He can jump down a level, well Brutus can jump down a

859
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:36,520
level, or stoop and reach the levels below. He can also reach Popeye on levels above.

860
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:43,800
Your enemies that you have, apart from, you know, the big bads like the sea hag and them,

861
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:48,680
are vultures, which, you know, whatever game, can you punch a vulture in the face?

862
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:56,680
Skulls and bottles. And then you can get a can of spinach in each level. They'll get Popeye

863
01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:03,400
invincibility and they can knock out Bluto Brutus by running into him, although he will swim back

864
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:11,480
out and try to, you know, get you again. Round one is the dock and you have a three-round cycle

865
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:18,040
that takes you off to different levels. And then the four-round cycle is you have the pogie bag,

866
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:23,960
which you can knock loose a barrel to get stuff out of. The barrel can also fall on Brutus's head.

867
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:30,360
You get points for that too. So other characters in the game, you also have olive oil, like I said,

868
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:36,840
sweet pea and wimpy, you know. I will gladly pay you tomorrow for a burger today.

869
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:44,600
And then, you know, you get, you lose life if you were hit by any of the baddies.

870
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:50,200
There were other releases. There were ports to the TRS-80, Color Computer 2,

871
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:59,000
Commodore 64, the TI-99-4A, Atari 8-bit, Intellivision, Atari 2600, Atari 5200,

872
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:04,120
ColecoVision, which was one of the good versions of it. And it was also one of the games that was

873
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:11,000
ported to the Odyssey 2. There is a board game based on this that came out in 1983,

874
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:18,120
and a Popeye tabletop video game with a color LCD, but it was not based on the arcade game.

875
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:26,600
It also was released later on in 1983 for the Famicom along with Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr,

876
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:33,080
ported by Parker Brothers, except for the Nintendo version that was handled by Nintendo itself,

877
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:41,560
the NES, sorry. It was, basically it even had a sequel for the Famicom that came out

878
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:50,120
on November 22, 1983, which was Popeye no Eigo Asobi, which basically translates to

879
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:58,760
Popeye's English Game, which also came out along with the later Donkey Kong Jr. Math.

880
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:06,120
And Namco did one in 2008 where they did an enhanced remake for mobile phones

881
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:15,640
that also had a bonus stage, and then an extra level that actually played to a Popeye short

882
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:21,240
called A Dream Walking, where Popeye had to save the sleepwalking olive oil and had some

883
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:26,760
trivia stuff in there. And then you could earn tokens, which you used to buy old comic strips

884
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:32,520
from, you know, the Simple Theater that later became the full Popeye shorts. And there you go.

885
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:38,840
All right. That was the game. I love this game. I had this on Commodore 64,

886
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:41,960
so that's the version I remember. And I don't remember being very good, but,

887
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:47,640
you know, just kind of like looking back on this game, I can't believe how much the computer gets

888
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:54,280
to cheat because Bluto can't, you know, he can kind of get you above, he can get you below,

889
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:57,720
so you kind of have to really like watch out for him or like psych him out and try to get him to

890
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:02,440
go early. And now I'm watching this playthrough that we're getting the music from, and I didn't

891
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:06,680
even remember this. Maybe the Commodore 64 version wasn't programmed for this. But once you get

892
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:12,360
through that three round cycle, you go back to the first port, obviously, with the hearts,

893
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:18,360
and now I see that the Sea Hag is throwing skulls at you as if the bottles weren't enough.

894
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:24,040
Yeah, and don't forget vultures too. Yeah, the vultures are in the last,

895
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:29,480
they're in the pirate ship, the help stage. Yeah, but you can punch them in the face.

896
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:33,480
You can punch them. I was actually watching the player in this video is punching the

897
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:37,000
vulture in the face pretty much as much as possible. It's pretty impressive.

898
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:45,000
Yeah, there it is. All right. Your classic game of the week, Popeye for originally the arcade,

899
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:50,200
but then was really released everywhere else in the 80s. As Jamie outlined everywhere that it

900
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:56,280
could be in the 80s, even the Odyssey two. So we have a little extra time here, but I know

901
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:59,960
you're sick and want to go soon. But I thought I would bug you a little bit because I know,

902
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:03,000
didn't you end up going to the Transformers thing still on Thursday?

903
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:08,600
Yes, I did. Well, we'd had our tickets for a month. There's no way I was missing that,

904
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:13,640
although I did have to step out halfway through the movie. Sure. But I came back in time for

905
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:20,920
dare to be stupid. Which if you don't make that the the fortune cookie, I'm going to cry.

906
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:26,200
I will try my best to remember. But between the time that we're taping this and the time

907
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:30,920
the show is live, I may I may forget. So maybe the chatters have to text you to pester you.

908
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:35,400
What's that? I will text you to pester you. That's a great idea. I always

909
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:40,440
appreciate a text message from Dark Sakura. I treasure everyone. I have a folder.

910
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:46,840
Like the ones where I harass you at work. The thing is, she's not lying.

911
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,560
Rob, I found this meme. Coffee.

912
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:57,320
All right. And you're still Trixie Mattel on my phone.

913
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:00,200
Yeah, you're still Katya on my phone. Heart. Yay.

914
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:07,960
Any parting thoughts for the listeners as we go back to the present time?

915
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:14,920
Well, I wanted to say one thing actually about seeing Transformers the movie is that

916
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:18,040
a bunch of people did actually stay in the theater to watch the whole credits.

917
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:24,040
And after the movie, there was actually an interview with Stan Bush, who did, you know,

918
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:29,480
the touch and saying dare in the movie. But he's talking about just, you know,

919
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:36,200
how those songs kind of changed the course of his music and how it was actually recorded for

920
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:39,400
the movie Cobra with Sylvester Stallone. Oh, wow.

921
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,280
Yeah. And then he's like, it ends up in some cartoon. Hey, this is pretty cool.

922
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:53,640
All right. Well, I'm gonna have to get my tickets for next time, I guess, since I missed it this

923
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:58,360
time. But, you know, Jamie, I do have my tickets for Gaga's Star is Born. So I'm very excited

924
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:05,160
about that. I kind of want to see it because I haven't. I did see like the one that wasn't

925
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:09,480
like the 70s. The Barbra Streisand one or the Judy Garland one?

926
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:13,400
The Barbra Streisand. Okay. You know, the interesting thing?

927
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:17,720
Because of Barbara and she's like Butta. She is like Butta. The interesting thing,

928
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:21,800
I'll leave you with this little random ass fact that has nothing to do with games, but deal with

929
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:27,240
it. So, you know, this is gonna be the fourth Star is Born movie because there was the Judy

930
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:33,640
Garland one, the Barbra Streisand one, and there was one in the 1930s. Well, the Star is Born from

931
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:41,560
the 1930s is public domain now. So because I guess the license was never renewed or something

932
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:46,600
happened with it, where it didn't like it is now in the public domain. So you can actually watch

933
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:51,880
the entire like Star is Born from the 1930s like on Wikipedia and stuff and on YouTube because it's

934
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:54,440
public domain. That's cool.

935
01:19:54,440 --> 01:20:00,840
Kind of interesting, huh? Little random fact. Yeah. Maybe that's something that we should do

936
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:04,680
one night is just have classic movies. Yeah. And we can stream it.

937
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,200
Yeah, because they're public domain. With commentary.

938
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:13,640
You could do that. And there's some. There's a few modern movies that fall in that category,

939
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:18,280
too. Like Wikipedia has a whole article on it. Like, you know, do what I do and stay up until

940
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:24,520
2 a.m. reading random Wikipedia articles. And there's a Wikipedia article on movies that are

941
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:29,800
in the public domain and why. It's fascinating. I wonder if any of our listeners would like that,

942
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:33,800
like on our twitches. Like, watch Rob and Jamie watch old shit.

943
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:38,680
Why not? Let us know in our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord. Cheap plug.

944
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:40,200
Do it.

945
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:43,400
All right. Any party shots here, Jamie, while we go back?

946
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:46,680
I like Sudafed.

947
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:57,560
Thanks, Jamie. And I hope the Sudafed is working and you're feeling much better.

948
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:02,600
Meanwhile, we've got some more gaming news to get into, including some rapid fire news before

949
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:07,480
we get to your calls. Still on Skype for now at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. But

950
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:12,840
the first Loki wants to start us off with some rapid fire news. So there's been an announcement

951
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:17,480
that Castlevania Symphony of the Night and Rondo of Blood will be coming out on PlayStation 4

952
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:23,400
October 26. It's going to be a collection of the two games for the first time available digitally

953
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:27,240
together. And that's coming out on the 26th of October.

954
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:30,040
Well, it's kind of a lie because didn't they do this on the Vita?

955
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,160
I don't think they were together, though. I thought they were together on the Vita.

956
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,240
Oh, well, it doesn't matter. Whatever the case may be.

957
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:40,040
We have confirmation on that thing that leaked last week.

958
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:46,280
Yes, exactly. So neat. Check it out. I don't like the fact that their letterbox,

959
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:50,360
or not letterbox, but like in a frame. I wish they had a way to like, you know,

960
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:54,680
enhance it or something like that. But going to chat at live.vognetwork.com,

961
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:59,000
Dark Tetsuya says, I'm mad it's a Sony exclusive, but what can you do? Frown.

962
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,520
You know, that's a good point. I saw some people kind of bellyaching on Twitter a little bit about

963
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:06,840
that. I shouldn't say a negative word like that, but, you know, some people giving feedback on

964
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:13,320
Twitter that, you know, it's weird that they just announced Simon for, you know, Super Smash

965
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:19,480
Brothers Ultimate. And yet the Switch, none for you buy. This is a PlayStation exclusive.

966
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:23,480
Maybe a timed exclusive. You never know. Could be. Maybe. Maybe they've got something

967
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,360
else in store for the Switch. Don't hold. Don't lose hope.

968
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:31,800
There's a lot of those DS games of the Green Master that, you know, pretty good. So.

969
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:39,480
Then, of course, another flashback console. But you may be asking, well, what,

970
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:45,160
what possible system could this be for? And the answer that I have no fucking clue because it's

971
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:51,720
a bunch of games and they're just from fucking everything. So it's called the Legends Flashback

972
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:57,800
Consoles coming out October 1st. So tomorrow, it's because it's a hodgepodge of licenses from

973
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:04,280
like Capcom and like Taito. I don't remember all that. Yeah, it's a Capcom Bandai Namco.

974
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:12,280
There's Tetris, Data East, Acclaim. So you got a big bunch of games all kind of jammed in there.

975
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:16,840
So what can you expect with it? Well, they've got stuff like Bad Dudes versus Dragon Ninja,

976
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:22,280
Burger Time, Super Burger Time. That's all I need. I'm good. Let's get it. Galaga,

977
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:29,960
you know, Joe and Mac, Mappy, Mega Man 1 and 2. They have Super Street Fighter 2, Strider.

978
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:38,920
Of course, Tetris and lots of other things. Total of 50 games in all.

979
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:44,760
And how much is it going to cost? I have no idea because they didn't mention that.

980
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:50,120
But it will be HDMI, have Safe States and Rewind. And it looks like they have Sega Genesis type

981
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:59,080
controllers. So hooray. Hooray. All right. Christmas gift. Yeah, it might be if you just

982
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:03,720
aren't getting enough retro consoles. There you go. Guess what? There's probably another one coming

983
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:09,800
because Liquid Media out of Vancouver just purchased the rights to 65 classic video game

984
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:15,960
titles, potentially opening the door to revival. So this company Liquid Media has gotten some of

985
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:20,760
the properties which include Bust to Move. Sadly, not the dancing game. We're talking about Bubble

986
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:26,040
Bobble because that would be the same franchise. NBA Jam also in this as well. Yeah, that's kind

987
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:29,080
of probably the most interesting one that they have. I thought EA would have had the rights to

988
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:32,520
that. You would think, but I guess for whatever reason, no, maybe it was because it was actually

989
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:37,160
Midway. EA was maybe you had it for a short time, but they let it lapse because they did

990
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:41,720
any jam. But now they've got their street thing instead, which is basically NBA Jam. Well, they

991
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:48,760
had NBA Street beforehand. Yeah. And Street is now part of NBA Live. And then, of course, they did

992
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:54,920
NFL Blitz and NBA Jam, but I don't think neither either of those were pretty good. So. So anyway,

993
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:59,960
they are making some comments on, you know, basically acquiring this and it's the acquisition

994
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:03,400
is going to help build the catalog. But what I think is interesting. OK, here's the thing.

995
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:08,200
So the chairman of Liquid Media Group, the chairman of Liquid Media Group is Joshua Jackson,

996
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:17,240
the actor from Doss's Creek. Remember? Yes. I did not know that's where he went because I was like,

997
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:21,080
I haven't seen him. And so what ever happened to that guy? Oh, this is what happened to that guy.

998
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:26,520
So anyway, you might be interested what he has to say if you want to know what was the name,

999
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:31,480
Pacey was Pacey's name. Anyway, he said, so many people, myself included,

1000
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:35,880
are returning to the classics. The nostalgia brought on by this resurgence in retro games

1001
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:41,080
connects us to our childhoods and creates incredible demand. So if I had the money to

1002
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:47,080
buy rights for games, I would buy rates to games. See it. Tiberi wants to remind us.

1003
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:52,360
Fringe was a very important. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yeah. There you go. Complete forgot he was in

1004
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:57,960
that anyway. Speaking of throwbacks, DDR's 20th anniversary. So last week we had the countdown

1005
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:03,480
clock. Now we know what it is. It's basically a throwback mode on DDR Ace machines. So what

1006
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:08,360
happened is that basically they unlocked these new categories. I knew they call. Yeah. What

1007
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:13,320
are they called folders of folders? So there's like a a folder to represent one, two, three,

1008
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:17,880
four and fifth mix, a folder to represent Max Max to an extreme and a folder represent Supernova and

1009
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:23,560
Supernova two. Uh, and then you have, and I think they have X in there as well to X and X two,

1010
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:27,800
they do X, X two and X three versus second. Uh, and then I guess technically there is a folder

1011
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:32,920
for 2013 and ACE, which I mean, why not? It's reference. It's all of the other songs, but it's

1012
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:37,720
just okay. But here's the bummer. So it has the folder that represents one, two, three,

1013
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:41,960
four, and five, obviously like near and dear to my heart, because that was when you and I were

1014
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:47,720
playing DDR like a lot when those was your bed, but it's like two mixes of paranoia,

1015
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:52,280
which that song has played the fuck out trip machine. Brilliant to you, which is cool.

1016
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:57,080
Still in my heart. I mean, it's kinda, it's like, it's nine songs, all this shit. That's

1017
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:02,600
been on every single mixture. It's basically every now key song and all his pseudonyms.

1018
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:08,680
But then when you get into max, yeah, it's basically every now key song you could ever

1019
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:14,680
imagine. Uh, and B for you is, uh, in the, these little throwbacks, but it's, it's still cool.

1020
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:19,240
I know I'm being a bitch, but it's really, it's pretty cool that you can go back and play max 300

1021
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:23,960
1998 bag, what they do though. So the style, the classic backgrounds. Yeah. Well,

1022
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:28,360
the styles are different too. So like you pay the first, uh, I think like the second mixed stuff

1023
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:34,360
or whatever, it actually does it in flat where, you know, everything looked like it did before

1024
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:38,520
the fail screens and the warrant screens are the same. Even in the max mode, they have that

1025
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:43,240
warning shark thing, which I completely forgot because it's not in, you know, extreme. Um, but

1026
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:46,920
they have those in the backgrounds and stuff. I like the backgrounds better than the dancers,

1027
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:50,840
to be honest. I've seen the dancers in the last few games. That's just some weak shit.

1028
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:57,160
Because we just don't want to create art. So we just, you know, default. I get it.

1029
01:27:57,160 --> 01:28:00,200
They have that in other games too, but orange right in chat says,

1030
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:02,600
I hope this is still around the next time I go to round one. I have to do,

1031
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:06,840
I'm actually going to be going to round one on Friday because Delvin has never been to one.

1032
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:11,080
So we're going to go over there and Dave and busters too. Oh, that's true. But still,

1033
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:14,200
we're going to go to round one just cause you know, he's never been. And I want to,

1034
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:21,080
I'll probably, it's been a while. Yeah. I'm going to go on the Bay area at the end of the month,

1035
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:27,720
but, um, I don't think I'm gonna get to round one. All right. Well, good luck. I have a family

1036
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:32,440
in tow. So, you know, Oh, family always getting in the way. All right. Let's, uh, let's check

1037
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:36,520
out some things that maybe Loki can stay home and play, uh, as they are coming out in stores this

1038
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:43,880
week. Yes. So this week we've got, um, starting off with Astro bot rescue mission on PlayStation

1039
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:50,200
four. We have Batman, the enemy within that's on Nintendo switch four is a horizon four on

1040
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:57,960
windows 10 PC and X-Box one, uh, fist of the North star lost paradise on PlayStation four

1041
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:06,600
mega man 11 on PC switch PlayStation four and X-Box one, uh, valve theory in arc hero school

1042
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:14,440
story on PC switch and PlayStation four assassins creed odyssey on PC PlayStation four and X-Box one

1043
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:23,000
super Mario party on the switch. And that's it. And actually it was funny. Um, cause I,

1044
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,920
I got kind of scared for a second there when I read super Mario party is not going to be,

1045
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:32,760
it does not work in handheld mode, which I was like, ah, but it's apparently you have,

1046
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:36,600
you can do it in tabletop mode. You just can't do it with the controllers attached,

1047
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:41,480
which is fucking stupid, but whatever. Oh, it's because isn't it because that whole new thing

1048
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:45,400
where you put the screens next to each other, like, uh, that's supposed to be a big selling

1049
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:50,040
point for Mario party. But if you play it on TV, you can't do that. So it's, I think it's because

1050
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:54,120
the games require motion controls and it's kind of hard to do that with the screen attached. Okay.

1051
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:58,120
That makes sense though. That'd be my guess. Yeah, no, it makes sense. I was like, ah, crap. I can't

1052
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:03,160
get it for the kids. Now it's cause the motion, but then I was like, ah, it's fine. All right.

1053
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:07,720
So I'm sure some people will be checking out super Mario party, uh, and, and all new friendships

1054
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:11,880
thanks to super Mario party. Yes, it might. I will be getting that and probably for a surprise

1055
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:18,040
before and maybe make a man 11. I don't know. I mean, wait for sale for making male 11.

1056
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:22,600
All right. Well, let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases there. So

1057
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:27,000
assassin's creed is actually getting a release. Assassin's creed odyssey gets a Japanese release

1058
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,760
the same time we get it. So they're actually getting that a little bit early on October 2nd

1059
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:34,040
and then their normal release day, which would be the fourth. They get rock man 11,

1060
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:38,600
which of course is mega man. Uh, they get a game on PlayStation four called Astro bot rescue

1061
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:42,840
mission. And lastly, uh, I think this is a price reduction. I think this game is already out,

1062
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:49,480
but Senran Kagura Estival versus show Jotachi no Sentaku, which is going into a series called

1063
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:54,760
best up, which I'm not familiar with, but I think that just means it's, you know, yeah. Cause it's,

1064
01:30:54,760 --> 01:31:00,520
it's like the equivalent of 1999 in Japan. And if you want to know what this game is, it's, uh,

1065
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:07,800
it's everyone knows that Senran Kagura is it's big enemy titties. Is it? Okay. That's all it is.

1066
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:12,520
I was gonna say they're going to the beach fan service. The game is going to the beach.

1067
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:16,840
You know where that's going? I mean, I'm sorry. They're ninjas, ninjas.

1068
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:21,880
It's their bikinis all the time. Too gay to know what you're talking about. Sorry.

1069
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:28,600
Uh, let's go to, and that is literally my excuse. All right. Going to the Nintendo switch.

1070
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:33,960
Rockman 11 is, uh, out of course, as it's on the switch as well as the PlayStation and all that

1071
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:40,200
we know this week. Um, switch also has a game called Sumiko Gurashi Atsumare Sumiko Town.

1072
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:44,840
It comes out this week on the switch. Otherwise Rockman would be probably the big release over

1073
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:50,600
there, uh, on the switch this week. Don't see anything on the 3DS this week. Um, except I guess

1074
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:57,400
the amiibo figure would work on the 3DS, uh, for Rockman. Um, if you wanted to get trash items and

1075
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:01,880
games or that, you know how, like, if the amiibo isn't supported in a certain game,

1076
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:06,120
it'll still give you something trash. It gives you e-tanks. Yeah. Well, no, I'm not even talking

1077
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:10,200
about with making man 11 specific specifically, but like say you're playing breath of the wild

1078
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:14,120
and you tap an amiibo that has nothing to do with Zelda or any of that. You just get like random

1079
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:17,320
treasure, right? That's been a while since I've done breath of the wild, but you get random shit,

1080
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:21,240
basically. So if you want to use your mega man amiibo to get random shit, you can do that. Even

1081
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:27,640
on the 3DS. It is super handy though. And Odyssey to tap bowsers. I could see where the coins are

1082
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:32,280
then missing. Yeah, I know some of the amiibo functionality is neat, but that's about it. All

1083
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:35,880
right. Well, how about the UK? A dark soccer is not here, but can you help us out? UK is getting

1084
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:39,400
pretty much the same stuff we got over here in North America. So fist of the North star

1085
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:45,160
lost paradise coming out on PlayStation four for the horizon four on PC and Xbox one,

1086
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:51,320
make me 11 on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one, Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

1087
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:58,200
That's going to be on PlayStation four and Xbox one and PC. And apparently if you order from

1088
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:04,680
game, you get it a few days early, whoopty shit. Astro bought rescue mission on PlayStation four,

1089
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:12,040
a game called song of memories on the switch and PlayStation four, super Mario party and party on

1090
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:16,600
the switch. And then they also have these Assassin's Creed Odyssey coming out the regular

1091
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:26,120
time PlayStation four and Xbox one, which is, oh, the early access edition is $30 or 30 pounds more.

1092
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:30,920
No. Oh boy. I hope it includes all the DLC or something. It's probably, yeah, it's probably

1093
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:35,000
like a collector's edition or something. Oh, and I'm sorry. There's one more. Uh, we have, uh,

1094
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,680
to be fair, it's the same thing for us is doing for us. It came out a few days. And apparently

1095
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:42,280
they're doing the same thing with other games too. So we have mutant league football dynasty

1096
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:48,600
edition on PlayStation four, Xbox one and the switch and WWE two K 19 early access as well,

1097
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:55,320
which is going to be on PlayStation four, Xbox one PC. Um, that's a week early. This must be

1098
01:33:55,320 --> 01:34:02,440
the new norm. Pay more money for early access quite a bit. Yeah. And it's the 30, 30, 30 pounds

1099
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:06,920
more. All right. Not worth it. Well, I mean, but, well, I mean, but again, like in the case

1100
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:10,680
of Forza, like if you know you're going to get all the DLC, you know, you might as well,

1101
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:15,160
you know, I, I kind of get it. I just assassin's creed. I don't know if I have that same commitment

1102
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:19,160
to, this is such a busy week with all these games coming out. Like, you know, fours, uh,

1103
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:24,040
SAS, this creed, mega man, like super Mario party. This is a huge week, you know, which

1104
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:27,640
we're getting into that season. It's the first week of October. Here comes the holiday releases.

1105
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:32,520
We got like call of duty in a few weeks and get ready. All out with 76,

1106
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:36,440
Red Dead Redemption, all the big year, you know, there's a new Red Dead Redemption thing on Monday

1107
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:40,120
Yeah. They're supposed to actually show more gameplay. That'd be nice.

1108
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:44,120
They shouldn't have, I don't need to see a ton of gameplay or no, I'm going to get it. So

1109
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:50,760
all right. That's all good. Let's go to the mailbag because every week you guys send us

1110
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:56,280
emails and we read emails. And if you want to send emails, you should participate at orange

1111
01:34:56,280 --> 01:35:01,800
lounge, radio.com is the place to send us emails. Again, that's participate at orange lounge radio.

1112
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:07,880
We got two emails this week. First one coming to us from Robert M. Robert M says not much to talk

1113
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:12,840
about right now. Just wanted to send an email. Uh, I'm probably going to get Jack box party pack

1114
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:18,680
five on switch instead of my old Mac book pro just for easier setup right now. Steam's only showing

1115
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:22,600
the game for windows and steam box. Well, steam is not going to show it for the consoles because

1116
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:26,360
they want you to buy it on steam, hoping to get more local multiplayer going in general.

1117
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:30,680
Uh, so he brings up Jack box party pack five, which you haven't really talked a lot about on

1118
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:34,360
the show, but I didn't realize they had the fifth one coming out. Oh yeah. Yeah, I know. Right.

1119
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:38,920
It's like now it's become such a, Oh yes. We're used to hearing about a new one every year, but

1120
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:41,800
this is the year that they're bringing back. You don't know Jack. So that's pretty exciting.

1121
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:46,280
Oh yeah. Yeah. So, and then I think everything else is new. I think the, the, you don't know

1122
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:49,960
Jack is the only kind of like revival game and everything else is new, but I'll get it because

1123
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:55,800
those games, God, those games are so easy to just, you know, get a party going. I'm really glad that

1124
01:35:55,800 --> 01:36:00,680
like Jack box kind of like has their MO figured out with these yearly releases and they're doing

1125
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:04,920
very well and everybody I know plays them. Even people that aren't like super big gamers

1126
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:10,360
because they're like board games basically. Yeah. And so they kind of replace it's nice because

1127
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:14,600
it's board games without having to have all the board games and without some asshole flipping the

1128
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:18,040
board over in the middle of the game. And also without having to clean off your table to put

1129
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:23,080
the board game on the table because it's decided to dump all their shit on the table as well as

1130
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:26,680
the rest of the house. So there's no place to play board games anywhere. I feel like this is

1131
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:32,200
turning into a venting session for you. It's just anybody with kids would know. I understand. Anyway,

1132
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:37,000
continuing with Robert M's email, hopefully this isn't an irresponsibly dumb joke mess,

1133
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:44,200
much less one I've already sent. What is Ryu's favorite music game? Taiko no Tazuuchan,

1134
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:47,800
I think was how I was supposed to read that. I don't know. Anyway, that's pretty good. Robert

1135
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:51,240
M you probably should have to send a voicemail or something in the future if you want it said

1136
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:55,000
the way you wanted it said. So there you go. And that was a really dumb joke, but thank you.

1137
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:02,040
All right, moving on. Email number two from serial emailer. I feel like I should have like a theme

1138
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:08,040
that goes with this, but we always enjoy hearing from our pal YYR who says, hello, LR. I have to

1139
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:14,520
agree with act devs call into last week's show. The recently announced PlayStation classic as a

1140
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:20,440
product just seems unfinished or possibly half-assed. First of all, the fact that only

1141
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:24,120
five out of the 20 promise games have been announced is kind of like a red flag to me.

1142
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:28,680
Certainly Sony knows that folks will be lining up to pre-order this thing and that there's no

1143
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:33,240
need to drip feed game announcements. Why hold them back? Is it because they're not even sure

1144
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:37,800
yet themselves or are they afraid that the list won't be well received? It's just very strange

1145
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:42,920
to me that we don't know about the majority of the games yet. I agree with this. Like why drip

1146
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:47,400
feed this information? Cause it's a tease because then they can do the long, long game with

1147
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:55,160
advertising. Nintendo is the king of teasing this shit way longer than is necessarily. They didn't

1148
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:59,240
do this for the classic NES. Yes they did. Did they really? They did. They only announced some

1149
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:02,360
of the games and they announced them later on. They did the same with the SNES classic too.

1150
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:06,040
I thought we knew them all right out the gate. No, we didn't. We knew about some of them.

1151
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:11,080
I know with the Switch thing, we only knew half out the gate and then we got the other half later

1152
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:15,480
on. I'm pretty sure that it wasn't everything to begin with, but at the same time though,

1153
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:19,640
is this thing targeting this year to come out or is it next year? I can't remember with the

1154
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:24,680
PlayStation classic. It's this year. Are they trying to target holiday for this? I believe so,

1155
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:32,520
yeah. I know, right? It's weird. Anyway, secondly in YYRS email, at least one of the five announced

1156
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:37,160
games is a driving game that takes full advantage of analog controls. However, they're not including

1157
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:42,360
dual shot controllers in the box. Thank you. Does this mean that they are going to sell them

1158
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:46,920
separately as upgrades, pushing the final price of this thing even higher? It sounds a bit shady

1159
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:51,240
to me, quite honestly. And since the majority of the later PS1 games use analog controls,

1160
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:54,840
it makes me wonder if the whole thing is compromised because of it. Third,

1161
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:59,960
YYRS laundry list of what were the problems of this thing. Sony seems to have missed a home run

1162
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:05,160
here. They've built an ecosystem that houses literally hundreds of digital PS1 games. Why not

1163
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:09,960
allow the PlayStation classic to connect to the PlayStation store where you could then download

1164
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:15,800
any PS1 game you've already bought for no extra charge. Well, think about what you're saying YYR

1165
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:21,160
and think about what Sony gets away with. And to be fair, what Nintendo gets away with too.

1166
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:27,640
Or purchase more of them for the normal price of $6 each. Wouldn't this be kind of a no brainer?

1167
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:32,520
They could even update the firmware to try to slow down hackers, which I suppose would be your

1168
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:36,360
retort is that the hackers are going to, well, I mean, YYR, I guess that would be the retort

1169
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:39,480
to the retort. Hackers are going to blow this thing wide open anyway. It doesn't matter.

1170
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:44,920
It's going to happen. There's no way around it. It's probably going to happen much quicker

1171
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:48,520
because I'm guessing, if anything, they're recycling the emulator from probably another

1172
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:51,720
system like the PSP or the Vita or something like that. And they're going to adapt it for

1173
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:55,640
whatever this is. It's got to have enough to onboard storage because if you think about it,

1174
01:39:55,640 --> 01:40:01,000
this is going to hold several disc worse of games. I mean, look at Final Fantasy 7 is three

1175
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:06,520
discs already. And our four was two discs. And I'm trying to think with the other stuff that was

1176
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:13,000
in there. I know there's other games that are multiple. Lots of games had lots of discs. Yes.

1177
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:18,040
So there's lots of storage on this thing. I mean, just to hold all this. The question,

1178
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:21,800
the answer is, I suppose you're going to be able to play all those games if you're willing to

1179
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:26,520
resort to the darker side of the Internet, which I am ethically. Are you willing to do that at the

1180
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:30,040
end of the day, though? Is it still worth it to pick it up to do that? I mean, because,

1181
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,600
you know, didn't I kind of say this on last week's show, too? We were talking about this,

1182
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:41,400
as I said, they really missed an opportunity to just shove Vita TV into this thing. And not that

1183
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:44,840
I think the Vita TV is, you know, obviously, because we all know how Sony feels about the

1184
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:49,880
Vita at this point, but you could have had PlayStation now, like you could have Trojan

1185
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:55,000
horse that thing into this. And, oh, you get all these classic games and push this little button

1186
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:59,240
here to charge your card. And you can play PlayStation three games and even more than just

1187
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:04,840
the classics. Push now. Push now. Right. Like, I feel like Sony missed an opportunity or maybe

1188
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:10,520
they didn't. We're about to find that out. But I just I feel like they sell these games backwards

1189
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:16,680
compatible for the place. I know. You see the no, because, you know, it's because they've got

1190
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:21,960
a copy Nintendo because look, it was like the top selling console, whatever. But here's the problem.

1191
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:27,400
Like PlayStation four can't handle PS one games. It can. It can totally handle a PlayStation three

1192
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:32,760
can handle the PSP can handle it. So this shit can fucking handle. But the problem is like,

1193
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:41,480
here's the thing. Super Nintendo games and NES games, they look nice when you scale them up on

1194
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:47,480
TV. And nowadays, you know, they look nice because it's just it wasn't rendering low poly stuff.

1195
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:55,880
These games don't I don't think are going to be as well received as like those games. And I say,

1196
01:41:55,880 --> 01:42:02,040
I wonder the same thing about the Nintendo 64 classic, which is supposedly still happening,

1197
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:07,160
because that may not be as fondly received as well, because those, you know, this is for as

1198
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:15,160
blurry as shit. So I'm just worried that it's not going to be as like well received as the

1199
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:20,520
SNES classic or the NES classic. I think if anything tend to be smarter to go with like a

1200
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:26,040
Game Boy classic and have it portable or just fucking put the games out on the goddamn platforms

1201
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:29,960
that you have so we can buy them. All right, calm down. Let me finish. Why is email here? So

1202
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:35,080
why ends up here? Where did he? They could even update the firmware, try slow down hackers.

1203
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:38,680
That's where we left off. So I also want to know more about the hardware before I even begin to

1204
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:43,640
consider preordering the thing. Are the ports on the front USB? If so, can I connect to DualShock

1205
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:47,800
three or four to them? Can I use the included controllers of the PC? These are all questions

1206
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:52,040
that could represent either added value or missed opportunities. So yeah, the announcement of the

1207
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:55,960
PlayStation classic just looks to me like a big bunch of questions. I hope they plan to answer

1208
01:42:55,960 --> 01:43:01,400
some of them before it releases, but you just never know, do you? Have fun YYR. Thank you for

1209
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:06,920
the email. And honestly, we don't always agree YYR, but I'm with you 100% on this. In fact,

1210
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:12,120
I think I named some extra things you missed, but you're right. There's the same reason why I didn't

1211
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:19,800
preorder one. I just, I'm kind of burned out on the classic machines right now. I just, the early

1212
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:24,600
PlayStation 1 stuff that didn't have DualShock is not like classic, I don't know, classic enough to

1213
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:30,280
me right now. And like Final Fantasy 7, I think I called out last week as well. I was like, okay,

1214
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:35,240
enough. Like how many fucking times are going to re-release Final Fantasy 7 when we know this

1215
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:40,200
remake's on the horizon anyway, right? Didn't we just hear about the Nintendo Switch version and

1216
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:43,480
we were supposed to get excited about that like two weeks ago? And now it's like, oh,

1217
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:50,120
but it's in the PlayStation classic, like enough. So it's just, I don't know. It's,

1218
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:57,480
I like R4, but I have it on my PC now. I played it through an emulator and I got to tell you,

1219
01:43:57,480 --> 01:44:01,880
it didn't look very good. I love R4. I think the real question, not look very good. I think the

1220
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:05,880
real question is going to be, what does this thing look like when the hackers blow it wide open?

1221
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:11,720
And that's, that's, admit it. That's what you all want to know. That's what you all want to know

1222
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:17,640
is, you know, and, and to be fair, you know, I realize it's an ethical question because you're

1223
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:22,040
downloading things you might not have paid for, but at the same time, many of you just want to be

1224
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:26,200
able to play the PlayStation 1 games that are just collecting dust in your closet on the consoles

1225
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:31,480
are currently hooked up to your TV. So if you are quote unquote stealing, maybe you're going to be

1226
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:37,080
doing things you already own and want to play. Does it make sense? It's stupid. It really is.

1227
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:41,480
Put Buster groove on this thing and I'll change my mind in a heartbeat,

1228
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:46,760
but I just don't, I just don't see that happening. They're probably going to have wipeout on it,

1229
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:56,440
but it's just like twisted metal, but Akuma JP in chat, uh, talking about final fantasy seven

1230
01:44:56,440 --> 01:45:01,000
over and over and over again, Akuma JP over at live.vogue.com says, but you get to see

1231
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:06,680
Aerith die again. Who's complaining? Dark Chakra isn't here. He remasters of this shit. Like give

1232
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:11,560
me a remaster of our four. I'll buy that shit on the PlayStation four. Give me a remaster of

1233
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:15,240
like what happened to like where they were like, Oh well we can't do PlayStation two games,

1234
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:19,720
but for some reason we can remaster them quote unquote. It's not really a remaster, but we put

1235
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:24,840
them in its own emulator. They can't just push a button that says make remaster and it's going

1236
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:28,920
to happen. Like they have to dedicate people time hours to that. So is it better that they're doing

1237
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,120
stuff like that or working on new things? Like that's what, that's where the questions get

1238
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:37,480
harder. It's not, it's an emulator. Just you create an emulator that can basically upscale

1239
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:42,120
this stuff and then you're done. So, so yes, magic button. So yes, magic button because they already

1240
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:46,840
have this shit on PC. It's been out for PC emulators have been able to do this shit for

1241
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:55,720
years, decades. All right. I mean, come on. It's, it's ridiculous. Let's move on from that email

1242
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:59,400
participate at orange launch radio.com. If you want to send us an email for a future week,

1243
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:02,840
we will get to live calls as well in a little bit over at orange launch radio on Skype,

1244
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:06,040
but we have some more news for you. I don't know if I'd call this first thing news,

1245
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:13,320
but it's an internet thing. It's where every gamer has a voice and some gamers are using,

1246
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:18,600
are choosing to use their voices in really ridiculous fucking ways. Right? Loki. Yes.

1247
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:26,760
So it all began. Let's think back to last week when basically, actually a couple of weeks ago,

1248
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:35,560
there was a Twitter user, um, by the handle, uh, Hanawa who put out a funny comic strip,

1249
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:42,680
you know, showing basically the end of super Mario Odyssey, where both Mario and Bowser are

1250
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:47,800
trying to woo the princess. And she's like, fuck off, you know, like she does in the game.

1251
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:54,440
And both Mario and Bowser are sad. And then Bowser has this magical crown, which, you know,

1252
01:46:54,440 --> 01:47:01,960
created Peachette in the new, um, remaster of new Super Mario Brothers U because it's not

1253
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:07,800
Toadette anymore. It's now Peachette and she's become this thing and it magically transformed.

1254
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:14,040
Well, I'm all for getting rid of Toadette to start. Toadette was lame. Like, sorry, sorry about

1255
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:18,840
it. But Toadette was always kind of lame. I hated her since Double Dash, which I believe

1256
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:22,760
was her first appearance. And I hated her in Double Dash. And now every time I see Toadette,

1257
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:29,640
I'm like, I have an irrational hatred of you. I can't explain. Sorry. So now thanks to this evil,

1258
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:36,600
this, this crown that apparently has the magical ability to turn whoever wears the crown into some

1259
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:46,440
fucking waifu anime big breasted chick. Um, so now we have Bowsette, Bowsette, the, the new

1260
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:53,480
internet hentai rule three, four thing that they're just people are running well with now,

1261
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:58,920
because not only is it just Bowsette, it's putting it on all the fucking creatures that you can think

1262
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:06,280
of and turning them into sexy waifu anime chicks and everybody is going fucking bonkers over this

1263
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:12,120
shit. Um, internet, we need to have a heart to heart talk because I've been using a lot of

1264
01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:15,000
social media this week because I use a lot of social media every week because I'm a social

1265
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:19,960
media whore, like many of you. Uh, and I'm on Facebook a lot and I'm on Twitter a lot.

1266
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:25,720
And as I've been scrolling this week, I've been seeing this over and over. And not only am I

1267
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:33,480
seeing this, I'm seeing this turn into more shit like Boozette and, uh, gender swapped Bowsette,

1268
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:38,120
which you think I wouldn't have a problem with, but yet somehow I do. And internet, I,

1269
01:48:38,120 --> 01:48:44,280
I'm going to need to ask you to knock this off. Like internet, please, please stop. No internet.

1270
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:53,960
I need to stop it. I am this. Why? This is why old people get upset and yell at you to get off

1271
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:59,640
their lawn because you do things like Bowsette that don't make any sense. Does it not make any

1272
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:06,200
sense though? Because apparently there is the new art book called the art of super Mario Odyssey,

1273
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:12,120
which is releasing this week in Japan. And apparently there's concept art of princess

1274
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:19,320
Bowser straight from Nintendo. So Bowsette cannon question mark. Thanks. I hate it

1275
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:28,040
because you know, Bowser basically has his own hat, which he can throw on things and it turns

1276
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:35,240
them into Bowser, uh, over at, uh, our live chat room over at live.vog network.com. Brad from

1277
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:40,520
pod culture says, where is Robert? Everybody say bye to Brad from pod culture. Who's just

1278
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:45,960
turned a lifetime ban from the chat room. Say goodbye everybody. It's been very lovely knowing

1279
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:53,720
him over these past few years. All right. And then already starting fast. Apparently not only

1280
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:59,640
has there been, um, petitions, you know, to include Bowsette into smash, which will never

1281
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:06,040
fucking happen, but there's going to be a Bowsette fan event being held in Japan on October 27th.

1282
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:13,720
Gather with all of your fans. If they recently, wait, wait, wait, wait. There's already a

1283
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:24,680
convention. This just, this just happened a week ago. Pornography is and OJC is very fast.

1284
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:31,480
What is wrong with you? People spend money on something that makes sense.

1285
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:40,360
People love put turning in anime objects into anime chicks. I mean, remember before this,

1286
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:48,600
game consoles, planets. It's it's never going to end. It's never going to end.

1287
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:59,720
Is that it? That's it for this week for this week. Moving on. Let's talk about something else. Let's

1288
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:03,880
talk about dragon quest 11. Let's talk about the worst part of dragon quest 11, the soundtrack. Oh

1289
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:09,640
yeah, I said it. The dragon quest 11 soundtrack. It's kind of stale and, um, I'm glad I'm not the

1290
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:15,320
only one that thought this because apparently with the dragon quest 11 release on PC,

1291
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:20,760
good old hackers and modders have decided to fix some of the problems of the music in the game.

1292
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:27,400
Mainly they took the mini instruments, uh, and replace them with orchestra music. That's right.

1293
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:32,360
It's dragon quest 11 orchestration overhaul mod. It was finished just over the weekend

1294
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:38,120
and it replaces all the music with an orchestrated rendition. So it sounds a little more like, uh,

1295
01:51:38,120 --> 01:51:43,480
dragon quest eight, I suppose. Now you do have to have copies of the dragon quest 11 soundtrack

1296
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:48,680
as performed by the Tokyo metropolitan symphony orchestra. So I guess they wanted to keep this

1297
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:52,760
legit. So you do have to own those sound, but I'm sure you could find those soundtracks if you

1298
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:58,680
wanted to be a very bad person, but it's such a way to do it. But anyway, they do say the goal

1299
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:03,160
of this mod is to provide the proper auditory experience that is deserving of this masterpiece

1300
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:07,800
of a game by applying all available orchestral variants of the songs present in the game

1301
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:12,520
as composed by Kochi Sugiyama and performed by the Tokyo metropolitan symphony orchestra.

1302
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:17,000
We do not contain or support piracy in any way, shape or form, and we will not provide the raw

1303
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:21,400
music files for listening. I'm sure someone else will. So if you want that, you'll have to buy the

1304
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:25,400
official symphonic suite albums. That being said, I want to follow up with something I was getting

1305
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:29,400
into on Bobby Black Wolf show, and this will not make me popular, but I don't care because I'm

1306
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:33,240
going to say what I'm going to say. And what I'm going to say is it is time for dragon quest to let

1307
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:40,280
Sugiyama go. Dragon Quest XI was a flop as far as the soundtrack is concerned, and it just shows

1308
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:45,800
that he cannot get past these same themes that have been going on for the past 10 games now.

1309
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:51,400
I mean, part of my hatred could be fueled by his politics because he's an anti-gay guy if you

1310
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:54,920
watch him on the television in Japan and stuff, and so maybe there's a little bit of that coming

1311
01:52:54,920 --> 01:53:00,840
into play. But honestly, play Dragon Quest XI, which for all purposes outside of the soundtrack

1312
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:06,520
is a great game. Play it on PlayStation 4 and load up Spotify and, I don't know, listen to Robin

1313
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:09,480
or something. It's probably going to take you out of the experience a little bit, but it's going to

1314
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:13,640
be better than the original soundtrack. Play the game and tell me the soundtrack isn't terrible.

1315
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:20,120
A downgrade from VIII, which was, unless you played it on 3DS, if you played Dragon Quest VIII

1316
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:25,400
on the PlayStation 2, it was that full orchestral experience. And so playing Dragon Quest XI

1317
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:29,880
honestly feels like a step backwards. And again, I said a little bit of this on Bobby's show at the

1318
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:36,200
tail end when he called us, but Final Fantasy has moved on past Nobuo Uematsu. These are very

1319
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:41,000
different scenarios, and I do not mean to speak ill of Nobuo Uematsu, especially coming off of

1320
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:46,200
last week's Newsies, taking a break because he's sick. But as we know, he decided to move on from

1321
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:50,040
the Final Fantasy series. Well, he still comes back to do, you know, like he does the theme or

1322
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:54,360
he'll do one or two compositions every soundtrack, but he went on to do other games and other things

1323
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:58,680
like Lost Odyssey, you know, other projects, things like that. Which we still need a sequel for.

1324
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:05,720
That is true, but this is different. But my point is, Final Fantasy has still done fine with

1325
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:11,720
different composers. Most notably, in my opinion, Final Fantasy XIV. If you fucking hate online

1326
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:16,840
games, you still need to check out the soundtrack, if nothing else. Seriously, go look up some of the

1327
01:54:16,840 --> 01:54:22,920
songs from Final Fantasy XIV soundtrack, the new, the post Realm Reborn stuff by a guy named Soken.

1328
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:30,200
It's probably the best music in the entire series, honestly. Now, to be fair, and I don't, again,

1329
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:35,640
I don't want to speak ill of Uematsu, but a lot of the reason why XIV soundtrack is good is that

1330
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:40,920
he takes elements of Uematsu's themes from the earlier games and really pushes them to the next

1331
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:48,520
level. Like, I love the Stormblood opening title screen, which takes the Final Fantasy theme,

1332
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:52,920
which Nobui Uematsu did, and puts like a pirate theme on it. It's awesome. It's a great, like,

1333
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:58,440
it's very well done. So anyway, my point is, and XIII had a different composer, XV had a different

1334
01:54:58,440 --> 01:55:03,880
composer, and all the soundtracks since, I believe, he did part of the XI soundtrack,

1335
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:09,480
and that was the last thing Nobui Uematsu did the full thing for. They've been fine. Dragon Quest

1336
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:17,320
will be fine too. Let Sugiyama go and let somebody else do the soundtrack. That is my opinion,

1337
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:22,120
whether you like it or not. How about your opinions over at live.vognetwork.com?

1338
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:26,600
Dungeon Buster says, yeah, the Dragon Quest XI soundtrack is kind of stale. I found myself wishing

1339
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:31,320
for more of Octopath Traveler's soundtrack while playing. Ooh, that's a really good call out too,

1340
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:35,880
is that Square has other franchises with other composers that are very talented as well. It's

1341
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:41,400
very, very good point. DarkTusia says, I do hope it's addressed on the Switch version. I know they

1342
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:45,240
usually add things to a new port, like voice acting, so maybe they'll have room for a better

1343
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:49,960
soundtrack. Let's hope. Bob Coffee says, the reason why Dragon Quest has the shitty MIDI

1344
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:55,240
is because Sugiyama is an asshole and wants people to pay for concert or orchestral CDs.

1345
01:55:55,240 --> 01:56:02,360
Bob Coffee, this is the justification to fire him, in my opinion. Let him go. Somebody else can take

1346
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:08,200
over this and can still incorporate the old shit into it, I'm sure, with the appropriate level of

1347
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:14,040
throwback and so on and so on. So it'll be fine. Dungeon Buster says, Final Fantasy XII,

1348
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:19,880
Hitoshi Sakamoto, who did the music for Tactics and Valkyria Chronicles. Yep, amazing stuff.

1349
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:26,520
So there you go. My opinion on Dragon Quest XI, and clearly I'm not alone, not just you guys in

1350
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:30,680
chat, but these modders that are like, what they put in the game is not good enough. It's really

1351
01:56:30,680 --> 01:56:37,320
not. Otherwise Dragon Quest, I mean, you know, and the soundtrack is, it's, it's just, it's just

1352
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:41,640
not as good as it was me. It felt like regression. That's the most frustrating part about it,

1353
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:45,320
considering, you know, Dragon Quest VIII was on the PlayStation fucking 2, and this is on the

1354
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:50,760
PlayStation 4, to have the, everything else feels like progression. To have this feel like regression

1355
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:59,640
is, is really stupid. Anyway, but hackers fixed it. Yay. Loki, let's move on to another story.

1356
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:06,200
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

1357
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:15,080
use the passphrase, heat. So this week, we had the Oculus event that was in San Jose,

1358
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:24,440
and they announced the new Oculus platform called the Oculus Quest. It is a standalone VR headset.

1359
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:29,480
You will not need a PC for this. It's basically going to be its own console. And with that,

1360
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:37,000
it has a resolution of 1600 by 1440 per eye. It's going to come with a couple of the Oculus

1361
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:41,560
Touch controllers, and it's going to have some sort of motion tracking in there as well.

1362
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:48,200
I don't think it's got the actual sensors, like the normal Oculus Rift does, but it's kind of

1363
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:54,280
like, it works in the reverse, basically the actual positioning track, positional tracking

1364
01:57:54,280 --> 01:58:00,360
will be done by the headset itself. It's supposed to retail for $400 for a 64 gigabyte model,

1365
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:03,720
and they said that about 50 games will be supported at release. It's supposed to come

1366
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:08,840
out in spring of 2019. Looks neat. I'm not sure if this would be something that I'm going to pick

1367
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:16,920
up because I don't need another console, but that's definitely a good price point to, you know,

1368
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:21,560
hopefully get people interested in VR stuff. Especially, I'd like to see other things this

1369
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:26,920
could be used for, aside from just some of the games and everything. I always wanted like the

1370
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:34,360
AR stuff with, you know, virtual desktop things and stuff, but I'm curious to see what's going

1371
01:58:34,360 --> 01:58:39,480
to be on the platform. Maybe see if this is gonna be like a major contender against like other

1372
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:43,640
consoles or something. I just think with PlayStation VR being so easily accessible,

1373
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:48,680
I just don't see Oculus, at least in the gaming space, really taking that crown. But, you know,

1374
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:52,360
again, I think VR is still trying to find where the niche can be for everything else,

1375
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:56,680
and that's a big part of the reason why Facebook wanted Oculus in the first place is, you know,

1376
01:58:57,320 --> 01:59:01,720
how could I maybe be like, how could Facebook bring a live concert experience and you could

1377
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:06,840
sit there in your Oculus and really feel like you're there. But I just feel like we're not

1378
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:11,800
seeing enough of that for like the common person right now. Right, and I agree with that, but also,

1379
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:15,240
you know, with the PlayStation VR, though, you have to buy the console, which is, you know,

1380
01:59:15,320 --> 01:59:20,920
almost $400, and then you have to buy the headset, which is also, you know, pretty expensive.

1381
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:25,720
Our pal Bobby in our chat, and you know he loves his VR, over at live.fognetwork.com says,

1382
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:30,120
the tracking here is way better than PSVR's and is ultimately cheaper, or maybe even the same price.

1383
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:35,640
Oculus venues already exist for Gear VR and Oculus Go, which is that concert thing. But like,

1384
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:42,040
I get all that. I really do. But A, I mean, the price and the technology ain't gonna matter when

1385
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:47,000
it comes down to the applications. And let's just put it this way, PlayStation VR has Tetris Effect

1386
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:54,600
coming out. But this Oculus Star Wars. Okay, well, okay, so then this is where now they're trying to

1387
01:59:54,600 --> 02:00:03,800
so they have a Darth Vader game coming to Oculus quest called Vader Immortal. And it looks neat.

1388
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:12,520
It's gonna be an episodic game, and apparently it says that you're playing as some person that

1389
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:18,040
gets kidnapped by Darth Vader, and I don't know, you're also like some apprentice or something.

1390
02:00:19,160 --> 02:00:24,280
Neat. So you get to be the bad, you're Darth Vader's apprentice? You get to be a bad guy?

1391
02:00:24,280 --> 02:00:31,160
I guess so, yeah. But maybe you're just not a bad guy. I don't know, but it's a neat idea, and that's

1392
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:37,880
definitely a good selling point. Okay, so this is not going to be fair, but it's where my head goes.

1393
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:42,920
Because I go, well, everyone got real excited when they announced a Star Wars game for Kinect.

1394
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:52,280
Look how that turned out. Not good. So, right, but let's be honest, the Kinect motion tracking

1395
02:00:52,280 --> 02:00:57,880
versus the motion tracking. Loki, my issues have nothing to do with how the tracking. No,

1396
02:00:57,880 --> 02:01:01,400
I understand. It's a stupid dance. It's like, well, we gotta pad this game out. Like, hey,

1397
02:01:01,400 --> 02:01:07,560
let's get the team behind Dance Central to make some content for it. And don't get me wrong,

1398
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:12,360
they did the best that they could with what they had. I'm not faulting them because those songs,

1399
02:01:12,360 --> 02:01:18,760
as stupid as they are, it's still catchy. I'm hand solo. It's catchy, but you know what? So bad.

1400
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:23,960
They did, it was not there. They were just following orders. No, they weren't, they were.

1401
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:29,160
They were just doing what they needed to do to get paycheck. Some executive made a really poor

1402
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:34,040
choice to do that, but I don't know. All right, well, I have to piggyback off that because

1403
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:38,280
guess what? You want to talk about more exec decisions, things that were completely out of

1404
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:43,640
the hands of the developers. You ready for this? Here's the development. Now you can get the,

1405
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:48,920
I would say it's DLC basically, but it's not. It's just a weapon. So you can get a weapon in

1406
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:52,680
Assassin's Creed Odyssey. So like, you know, put in a little code and get a weapon, right?

1407
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:57,320
And you would expect, oh, a pre-order bonus or, oh, buying this at Best Buy. That's what we're

1408
02:01:57,320 --> 02:02:01,000
used to, to getting the special weapons and armor, right? Oh no, no, no, no. This one's really good.

1409
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:07,160
So the way that you get this weapon is that you will get the code with Totino's pizza rolls.

1410
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:14,040
That's right. You, or the, the, not that, they don't just do the pizza rolls. They do that

1411
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:18,840
shitty like cracker pizza. That's like probably like a buck at Winco. That's, that's them too,

1412
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:25,960
right? I don't know. We see those in college all the time. But anyway, so you, you can get a code

1413
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:30,360
for Assassin's Creed Odyssey to get a special weapon for a limited time to get bonus in-game

1414
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:36,440
items for the upcoming Ubisoft title. This deal is only good in the US. Sorry to everybody else

1415
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:42,840
in other countries, but no pizza rolls for you. You can also get things like temporary XP boosts,

1416
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:48,760
weapons. I guess the first code gets an XP boost. The second gets a Horn of Ares sickle sword,

1417
02:02:48,760 --> 02:02:53,960
and the third gets you a Bighorn bow. Every- You have to have like 12, I think, to get everything.

1418
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:59,320
Well, cause you get XP boosts after that for everything else. And, and, you ready for this?

1419
02:02:59,320 --> 02:03:06,280
If you get them at Walmart, you get an additional bonus. That's right. You get the Ram Axe if...

1420
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:15,880
I can't help, this is so stupid. You get the Ram Axe if you buy the only at Walmart,

1421
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:21,000
120 count pizza rolls pack. Got all of those pizza rolls.

1422
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:26,360
You know, they did this last year with Totino's had a-

1423
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:31,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Brad from Pod Culture in chat. This needs to be, this needs to be responded to.

1424
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:36,680
Says, shut your whore mouth, pizza rolls are awesome. When did I say pizza rolls aren't

1425
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:43,000
awesome? Pizza rolls are fucking amazing. But still, there's something about the whole,

1426
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:48,280
you gotta buy, you don't just have to buy a little box. You have to put 120 count pizza rolls box,

1427
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:55,640
enough to feed an Assassin's Creed Odyssey army in order to get the Ram Axe.

1428
02:03:55,640 --> 02:03:57,320
Apparently I'm not trying hard enough.

1429
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:07,240
Pizza rolls are better than gender rolls. I will, uh, I will say that.

1430
02:04:07,240 --> 02:04:11,800
Because like the word Assassin, pizza rolls will make your ass twice as big.

1431
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:19,800
Are you ready to put the ass in Assassin's? We'll get that 120 count pack of pizza rolls.

1432
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:24,760
They did this last year Shadow of War 2, and it was just as ridiculous then.

1433
02:04:26,440 --> 02:04:31,320
But remember, they need all the money. They're hurting. They can't make AAA games anymore

1434
02:04:31,320 --> 02:04:38,440
because they're not selling enough Super Ultimate Editions and pizza roll tie-ins and other nonsense.

1435
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:44,520
All right. Admit it, Loki. Are you going to pick up the new Assassin's Creed? I don't like

1436
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:48,760
Assassin's Creed. Well, this new one looks really good. I might pick it up. And you know what,

1437
02:04:48,760 --> 02:04:51,720
bitch? I might pick up some pizza rolls because pizza rolls are pretty good.

1438
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:55,800
You're part of the problem, Rob. I can't help it.

1439
02:04:58,040 --> 02:05:00,680
Anyway, just a few more stories for you guys. Then we're going to open up the

1440
02:05:00,680 --> 02:05:04,040
Skypline at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. Loki.

1441
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:07,240
So of course, since Battle Royale has to come to all the things,

1442
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:11,640
what thing's going to get Battle Royale next? Well, it's going to be Doom.

1443
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:14,840
And I'm not talking about new Doom. I'm talking about old Doom, classic Doom.

1444
02:05:15,640 --> 02:05:23,000
The Doom you remember as a child called Doom Royale with Cheese. And it's a mod that'll let

1445
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:30,120
64 players fight to the death using the double-barreled shotgun.

1446
02:05:30,120 --> 02:05:33,240
And of course, just like PUBG and Fortnite, there's the shrinking

1447
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:41,240
play field. They have ammo weapon scavenging. And of course, you have to be the last man standing.

1448
02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:46,760
So neat. You can find that over at ModDB if you're interested in checking it out.

1449
02:05:48,760 --> 02:05:50,840
It sounds kind of awesome, though. It's neat.

1450
02:05:50,840 --> 02:05:53,720
Yeah. No, I play Doom Battle Royale. It sounds like fun.

1451
02:05:53,720 --> 02:05:59,160
Yeah. Yeah. All right. And last but not least tonight, before we open up the Skypline,

1452
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:02,920
let's talk about, you know, since all these classic systems are happening,

1453
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:07,160
you know, somebody on the internet had to say CDI classic when.

1454
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:15,320
So, oh, no, no. So somebody made a Photoshop user. I don't know if this guy actually made it,

1455
02:06:15,320 --> 02:06:19,160
but he made the tweet. Skully1888 tweeted at Philips with,

1456
02:06:19,160 --> 02:06:23,720
Philips CDI classics, 20 classic games, including Hotel Mario,

1457
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:28,280
Zelda, The Wand of Gamelon, Link, The Faces of Evil, The Seventh Guest,

1458
02:06:28,280 --> 02:06:33,960
Playboy's Complete Massage, and Mad Dog McCree, as well as Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia.

1459
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:39,160
Okay. Like out of that list, The Seventh Guest is probably the only notable game.

1460
02:06:39,880 --> 02:06:40,840
It's not very notable.

1461
02:06:40,840 --> 02:06:44,360
Mad Dog McCree, I know they released a ton of times, but it's not very good.

1462
02:06:44,360 --> 02:06:47,160
Seventh Guest they've re-released several times. Not very good.

1463
02:06:47,160 --> 02:06:50,680
It didn't age well. That's a problem. Anyway, here's the crazy part.

1464
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:55,560
Philips replied saying, thank you very much for reminding us of the Philips CDI.

1465
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:59,320
We appreciate the thought of a smaller classic version of one of our legacy devices.

1466
02:06:59,880 --> 02:07:03,000
And then somebody was like, you would make the buzz if you did it.

1467
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:04,920
And Philips responded, thank you for your love.

1468
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:08,200
And there's such a positive fucking person working in this Twitter account.

1469
02:07:09,240 --> 02:07:11,560
Hi, thank you for your love, encouragement, and interest.

1470
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:15,400
We will try our best to fulfill your dreams and release something you suggest,

1471
02:07:15,400 --> 02:07:19,400
but cannot promise anything yet. Please be patient and stay tuned.

1472
02:07:19,400 --> 02:07:20,680
Thank you in advance.

1473
02:07:20,680 --> 02:07:24,360
Okay. This isn't going to fucking happen. Like, I don't know where,

1474
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:28,280
I don't know where this joke, first off those Nintendo licenses,

1475
02:07:28,280 --> 02:07:31,800
Nintendo would rather you stop talking about those games.

1476
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:36,600
Nintendo would really rather you stop talking about Hotel Mario and Zelda the Wand again.

1477
02:07:36,600 --> 02:07:40,920
They'll put Balzette in Smash before they put this out.

1478
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:42,680
I mean, this is never going to fucking happen.

1479
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:49,160
Now that's not to say that Philips couldn't still put something out with the Seventh Guest

1480
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:54,200
and Mad Dog McCree, but like, I mean, if you don't think the PlayStation

1481
02:07:54,760 --> 02:08:00,360
classic lineup sounds very good so far, the Philips CDI lineup, not going to be good.

1482
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:06,360
Now, I guess they could always do maybe like homebrew or something.

1483
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:10,600
I don't know, but I just, I just, just let it go.

1484
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:11,720
No, let it go.

1485
02:08:11,720 --> 02:08:12,440
Please don't.

1486
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:19,560
The Philips CDI is best left as that, that thing that some guy has at a booth at a classic gaming

1487
02:08:19,560 --> 02:08:25,560
expo that you look at and you pick it up and you play Zelda Wanda Gamelon for five minutes ago.

1488
02:08:25,560 --> 02:08:26,200
What the fuck?

1489
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:28,920
Wow. This really was a shit game.

1490
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:32,200
And then you go on with the rest of your day.

1491
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:37,080
So now that we've gotten these two consoles out of the way, uh, anybody hitting up, uh,

1492
02:08:37,080 --> 02:08:41,960
Panasonic for the 3DO Mini or the, or Sega for the Saturn Mini?

1493
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:43,320
Where's my Jaguar Mini?

1494
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:47,880
Let's play Aliens First Predator and Tempest 2000.

1495
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:49,240
You want your Jaguar Mini?

1496
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:49,400
Yeah.

1497
02:08:49,400 --> 02:08:50,040
It's coming out.

1498
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:52,440
It's called the fucking new Atari system that they have.

1499
02:08:53,720 --> 02:08:55,320
That's your Jaguar Mini right there.

1500
02:08:56,840 --> 02:08:57,340
All right.

1501
02:08:58,120 --> 02:08:59,320
We're going to open up the Skypline.

1502
02:08:59,320 --> 02:08:59,880
It's that time.

1503
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:01,960
So Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1504
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:05,080
If you want to give us a call about something we've talked about so far, or maybe something

1505
02:09:05,080 --> 02:09:08,120
we haven't, but, um, I know there's a lot of news stories we didn't get to.

1506
02:09:08,120 --> 02:09:08,840
Yes.

1507
02:09:08,840 --> 02:09:10,920
This is important news that we have to get to.

1508
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:11,080
Okay.

1509
02:09:11,080 --> 02:09:12,760
So tell me some of the stuff we missed here.

1510
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:14,440
Just talking about Assassin's Creed.

1511
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:18,040
And of course in Assassin's Creed, there is a giant statue of Zeus.

1512
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:21,240
And what can you do with this giant statue of Zeus?

1513
02:09:21,240 --> 02:09:24,680
You can climb on its penis because it's Assassin's Creed.

1514
02:09:24,680 --> 02:09:27,080
And of course you can do that shit.

1515
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:27,720
So why not?

1516
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:30,600
It's very important news.

1517
02:09:31,480 --> 02:09:33,240
Can I put a pizza roll on his penis?

1518
02:09:34,120 --> 02:09:34,840
No, you may not.

1519
02:09:35,560 --> 02:09:36,120
Why not?

1520
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:41,960
Sony is ending support for certain online games, including Warhawk, Twisted Metal,

1521
02:09:41,960 --> 02:09:43,880
PlayStation All-Stars, Battle Royale.

1522
02:09:43,880 --> 02:09:47,960
That's going to be ending on October 25th, 2018.

1523
02:09:47,960 --> 02:09:49,560
I'm surprised they hadn't already pulled the plug.

1524
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:54,360
And Drawn to Death, David Jaffe's game is going to be out.

1525
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:57,960
That came out a long time ago as one of the PlayStation plus titles, and it's going to

1526
02:09:57,960 --> 02:09:59,800
be ending March 25th, 2019.

1527
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:03,000
So play it while you can.

1528
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:04,520
I think it's free to play.

1529
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:09,000
Yeah, it was free to play on PlayStation Plus, but I think they still charge 20 bucks for

1530
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:09,080
it.

1531
02:10:09,080 --> 02:10:12,520
Speaking of PlayStation Plus, for October, we're going to be getting Friday the 13th

1532
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:14,680
and Laser League, which Laser League is just like Tron.

1533
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:15,560
So check it out.

1534
02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:19,960
PlayStation 3 is getting Master Reboot and The Bridge, which is cross by PlayStation

1535
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:21,240
4 and Vita.

1536
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:25,800
PlayStation Vita is cross by PlayStation 4, RocketBirds 2 Evolution and 2064 Read Only

1537
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:26,280
Memories.

1538
02:10:26,280 --> 02:10:27,320
So that's pretty awesome.

1539
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:27,880
Neat.

1540
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:33,720
Um, on the Xbox front, Games of Gold, you're going to be getting Overcooked for the month

1541
02:10:33,720 --> 02:10:38,200
of October and Victor Vran from the middle of October to the 15th.

1542
02:10:38,200 --> 02:10:38,520
All right.

1543
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:40,760
Let's get to the phones real quick and then we'll get back to Loki.

1544
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:41,880
Hi, you're on Orange Mountain Radio.

1545
02:10:41,880 --> 02:10:42,760
Who's this?

1546
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:43,720
Hey, this is Def.

1547
02:10:43,720 --> 02:10:44,680
Hey Def, how you doing?

1548
02:10:46,360 --> 02:10:49,800
Well, I have a Pokemon Go story that happened today.

1549
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:51,160
I love Pokemon Go stories.

1550
02:10:51,160 --> 02:10:53,800
Is this about the day that you hit BFF status with me?

1551
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:55,000
Because I'm sure it was a great day.

1552
02:10:56,040 --> 02:10:56,920
No, it was a great day.

1553
02:10:56,920 --> 02:10:59,080
But no, I'm talking about specifically today.

1554
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:07,400
And it's something that we sometimes joke about in the whole community that when bad

1555
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:12,680
weather's in the city, you probably shouldn't go out and play.

1556
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:22,120
Well, there's a tropical storm happening right now in my city, but right now it's like really

1557
02:11:22,120 --> 02:11:25,560
calm that it was cloudy earlier and all.

1558
02:11:26,760 --> 02:11:32,280
But we had a Mewtwo raid near my house, so I decided to go.

1559
02:11:33,240 --> 02:11:39,480
I didn't notice until I was out and I was heading my way to that raid that we had a

1560
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:40,040
thunderstorm.

1561
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:45,320
I didn't pay that much attention and I said, oh, that seems like it's far away.

1562
02:11:46,840 --> 02:11:48,040
Nothing bad will happen.

1563
02:11:48,040 --> 02:11:52,120
You did the same thing we always do with the alert that comes up in Pokemon Go.

1564
02:11:52,120 --> 02:11:53,160
There's a severe weather.

1565
02:11:53,160 --> 02:11:53,800
Yeah, who cares?

1566
02:11:53,800 --> 02:11:56,200
Click or just like I'm a passenger.

1567
02:11:56,200 --> 02:11:56,840
Yeah, sure I am.

1568
02:11:57,480 --> 02:12:05,400
Here's the thing that the weather in Pokemon Go at the moment was sunny because because

1569
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:06,360
of course it was.

1570
02:12:07,560 --> 02:12:08,360
It always is.

1571
02:12:08,360 --> 02:12:09,000
And we had that.

1572
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,160
We had it the other day, too, is like weather warning.

1573
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:12,840
It's like weather warning.

1574
02:12:12,840 --> 02:12:14,120
There's clouds in the sky.

1575
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:15,480
I don't even know what that warning was for.

1576
02:12:15,480 --> 02:12:17,240
Maybe a fire is a fire alert or something.

1577
02:12:17,320 --> 02:12:17,720
Maybe.

1578
02:12:17,720 --> 02:12:18,120
I don't know.

1579
02:12:18,120 --> 02:12:18,520
Who knows?

1580
02:12:18,520 --> 02:12:21,400
I want to know the rest of the story because it sounds like danger is involved.

1581
02:12:21,960 --> 02:12:26,200
Yeah, but yeah, it actually looks like like partially cloudy.

1582
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:30,440
But yeah, it was really cloudy and thunder was happening happening.

1583
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:35,720
And we I happened to to get there to the raid and people were waiting.

1584
02:12:36,360 --> 02:12:43,640
And and yeah, the thunder was still coming out, but it was like far.

1585
02:12:44,280 --> 02:12:44,920
OK.

1586
02:12:44,920 --> 02:12:48,920
When suddenly we were going to we're we're preparing for the raid and all.

1587
02:12:49,560 --> 02:12:52,680
And suddenly we heard like a boom.

1588
02:12:54,520 --> 02:13:03,000
And yeah, there was a big flash there and and I just like I was I started like, well,

1589
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:03,640
it happened here.

1590
02:13:03,640 --> 02:13:04,200
It happened here.

1591
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:06,360
It happened near near near us.

1592
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:07,960
And I was kind of panicking.

1593
02:13:08,760 --> 02:13:16,920
And then I noticed that like 15 meters, like, I don't know, the conversion by 20 feet, maybe

1594
02:13:16,920 --> 02:13:22,520
they'll know that a tree that was near was destroyed.

1595
02:13:23,480 --> 02:13:24,440
Oh, my God.

1596
02:13:24,440 --> 02:13:29,400
So you went out to catch a Mewtwo and a tree right next to you got hit by lightning.

1597
02:13:30,280 --> 02:13:30,920
Basically.

1598
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:35,480
And but people there were more people there that were way near.

1599
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:37,320
But act out.

1600
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:38,440
Did you catch the Mewtwo?

1601
02:13:40,280 --> 02:13:44,360
Sadly, sadly, because people were panicked.

1602
02:13:44,360 --> 02:13:46,040
They were panicking.

1603
02:13:46,040 --> 02:13:48,920
We only had like a few people there.

1604
02:13:48,920 --> 02:13:54,440
And we had like two groups and my group didn't finish the raid.

1605
02:13:55,720 --> 02:13:57,160
We couldn't catch it.

1606
02:13:58,680 --> 02:13:59,480
He did all that.

1607
02:13:59,480 --> 02:14:01,640
You almost got killed by lightning and they didn't.

1608
02:14:01,640 --> 02:14:03,240
You couldn't even catch the damn Mewtwo.

1609
02:14:04,040 --> 02:14:06,600
But that's that's the least of my worries.

1610
02:14:08,040 --> 02:14:10,280
No, you know, I had to make fun of made fun of it somehow.

1611
02:14:10,280 --> 02:14:12,600
But that's that's crazy that it was like so.

1612
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:13,160
Oh, my God.

1613
02:14:13,160 --> 02:14:14,040
Like, that's scary.

1614
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:17,400
I thought this was going to be that like lightning hit the pokey stop and lightning

1615
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:21,560
destroyed the pokey stop when pokey stops are so rare in Mexico to begin with.

1616
02:14:21,560 --> 02:14:28,120
Yeah, the pokey stop, the little the little thing was next to that tree.

1617
02:14:28,120 --> 02:14:32,680
So, yeah, good thing it didn't start a fire and burned down the pokes.

1618
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:33,720
I shouldn't make fun of it.

1619
02:14:33,720 --> 02:14:35,160
Could you use Thunderbolt?

1620
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:36,200
It was very effective.

1621
02:14:38,360 --> 02:14:45,000
Loki, people caught Mewtwo in that raid with with thunder, with the thunder attack.

1622
02:14:45,720 --> 02:14:50,040
So, yeah, you should you should remember that for next time to yell that out.

1623
02:14:50,040 --> 02:14:51,240
Pikachu used Thunderbolt.

1624
02:14:51,240 --> 02:14:52,280
It's super effective.

1625
02:14:52,280 --> 02:14:53,080
That's that's good.

1626
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:53,960
I like that, Loki.

1627
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:59,560
Oh, but everyone was fine.

1628
02:15:00,200 --> 02:15:02,120
Uh, someone did that.

1629
02:15:02,120 --> 02:15:06,040
They'd get hit by the tree, but nothing too serious.

1630
02:15:06,040 --> 02:15:08,520
Just like a scrap or something.

1631
02:15:08,520 --> 02:15:09,020
Oh, my God.

1632
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:10,600
Sudowoodo.

1633
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:11,640
No, I'm just kidding.

1634
02:15:11,640 --> 02:15:11,880
I'm sorry.

1635
02:15:11,880 --> 02:15:12,520
I can't help it.

1636
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:16,680
No, we're all in the community locally here.

1637
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:18,360
We're joking about it and all.

1638
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:24,280
And again, it was like it was a complete like terrifying.

1639
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:29,160
But at the at the same moment, like really exciting moment, because, oh, my God, it

1640
02:15:29,240 --> 02:15:29,560
happened.

1641
02:15:29,560 --> 02:15:30,120
That happened.

1642
02:15:30,840 --> 02:15:31,720
So, you know what?

1643
02:15:31,720 --> 02:15:35,000
And danger is fun to flirt with once in a while.

1644
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:38,520
That was that was like thrill seeking Pokemon adventures.

1645
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:40,360
Soon you're going to be the star of a documentary.

1646
02:15:40,360 --> 02:15:43,560
But instead of like storm chasers, it's going to be Mewtwo chasers.

1647
02:15:45,240 --> 02:15:46,360
Pokemon raid chasers.

1648
02:15:46,360 --> 02:15:47,240
Yeah, chasers.

1649
02:15:47,240 --> 02:15:47,800
Oh, my God.

1650
02:15:47,800 --> 02:15:49,000
I'm screaming.

1651
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:53,800
Well, I know we're only sitting here making jokes because you're OK and everybody else

1652
02:15:53,800 --> 02:15:55,800
is OK, except whoever got hit by the tree.

1653
02:15:55,800 --> 02:15:57,720
But it sounds like it was a little more superficial.

1654
02:15:57,720 --> 02:15:59,560
Like it wasn't a big branch or something.

1655
02:15:59,560 --> 02:15:59,800
Right.

1656
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:00,520
Sounds like they're OK.

1657
02:16:01,240 --> 02:16:01,480
Yeah.

1658
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:05,240
Everybody got the they're fine.

1659
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:06,040
Nobody got hurt.

1660
02:16:06,040 --> 02:16:12,360
So I'm really glad about that, because if someone had gotten hurt or even gotten hit

1661
02:16:12,360 --> 02:16:17,080
by the lightning, it would have been like like really terrifying.

1662
02:16:17,080 --> 02:16:19,080
Like and again, it was terrifying.

1663
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:22,520
But since nothing happened, basically.

1664
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:23,880
Yeah, we're laughing.

1665
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:26,040
And yeah, the tree and all that stuff.

1666
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:27,960
But yeah, it's something serious that happened.

1667
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:34,600
I don't know what I would have done like seriously, because it was like at that moment.

1668
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:40,920
And I still have the image basically ingrained in my in my head, in my mind right now of

1669
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:42,040
the flash.

1670
02:16:42,040 --> 02:16:46,200
I literally saw that flash, the lightning flash that that hit the tree.

1671
02:16:46,920 --> 02:16:49,160
And it was really like something.

1672
02:16:49,960 --> 02:16:53,400
You know, it also goes to show that those warnings that they put at the beginning of

1673
02:16:53,480 --> 02:16:54,600
the game, like they're no joke.

1674
02:16:54,600 --> 02:16:56,040
Like you have to really pay attention.

1675
02:16:56,040 --> 02:17:00,600
And, you know, I hate to be a downer, but I think it's it's worth saying, like, you

1676
02:17:00,600 --> 02:17:03,720
know, I know in the Ingress community, like there was a player in Europe who actually

1677
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:08,760
died because they were not paying attention and they essentially walked off a cliff.

1678
02:17:08,760 --> 02:17:11,400
Like and I know that sounds ridiculous as I'm saying it out loud and you're probably

1679
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:11,880
going like what?

1680
02:17:11,880 --> 02:17:13,800
But like, you know, they just weren't paid.

1681
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:14,600
I think it was at night.

1682
02:17:14,600 --> 02:17:16,120
So it's kind of dangerous as well.

1683
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:18,280
And they were, you know, trying to take down a big field or something.

1684
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:18,600
I don't know.

1685
02:17:18,600 --> 02:17:19,960
They basically like fell off a cliff.

1686
02:17:19,960 --> 02:17:21,720
I think it was like wet outside or something.

1687
02:17:21,720 --> 02:17:25,560
So like, you know, they're luckily active is OK and everybody's OK.

1688
02:17:25,560 --> 02:17:27,640
So we can we can poke fun and laugh at it.

1689
02:17:27,640 --> 02:17:30,280
But there is a very serious, you know, note here.

1690
02:17:30,280 --> 02:17:32,600
And that is like, you know, those warnings do exist for a reason.

1691
02:17:32,600 --> 02:17:36,200
You do want to be aware when you're playing these games, because even though we're talking

1692
02:17:36,200 --> 02:17:39,480
about like natural weather and these, you know, freak things like you don't want to,

1693
02:17:39,480 --> 02:17:43,480
like, get hit by a car because you cross the street, you know, that type of thing like

1694
02:17:43,480 --> 02:17:44,920
that is serious as well, you know?

1695
02:17:44,920 --> 02:17:52,200
Yeah, that this basically made me right about the game and and how I should approach it,

1696
02:17:52,200 --> 02:17:58,120
because again, like at the beginning of the story, like I said, I was like and nothing

1697
02:17:58,120 --> 02:17:58,840
bad will happen.

1698
02:17:59,560 --> 02:18:01,960
And literally that happened like, whoa.

1699
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:08,840
And so, yeah, the story is basically just for people that play like Ingress, Pokemon

1700
02:18:08,840 --> 02:18:11,320
Go, all this kind of games.

1701
02:18:11,320 --> 02:18:12,280
Just be careful out there.

1702
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:18,600
It we can sometimes think that nothing bad will happen and then it happens.

1703
02:18:18,600 --> 02:18:21,000
So so basically that just stay aware.

1704
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:21,640
For sure.

1705
02:18:21,640 --> 02:18:22,200
For sure.

1706
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:26,440
And Act F for next time, make sure you train a Golem and get them on your team because

1707
02:18:26,440 --> 02:18:28,520
the Golem will absorb the Thunderbolt for next time.

1708
02:18:29,560 --> 02:18:30,120
I will.

1709
02:18:30,120 --> 02:18:30,680
All right.

1710
02:18:30,680 --> 02:18:31,400
Thank you for the call.

1711
02:18:31,400 --> 02:18:32,520
Act F and happy hunting.

1712
02:18:32,520 --> 02:18:33,020
Take care.

1713
02:18:33,480 --> 02:18:34,360
Hey, thanks for having me.

1714
02:18:34,360 --> 02:18:34,840
Yeah, no problem.

1715
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:35,480
Thanks for the story.

1716
02:18:35,480 --> 02:18:36,040
It was really good.

1717
02:18:36,040 --> 02:18:36,540
Bye.

1718
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:37,660
Wow.

1719
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:38,360
Yeah.

1720
02:18:38,360 --> 02:18:38,840
Oh my gosh.

1721
02:18:38,840 --> 02:18:39,320
I can't imagine.

1722
02:18:39,320 --> 02:18:40,120
Oh, I've never.

1723
02:18:40,120 --> 02:18:42,040
Have you ever had lightning hit that close to you?

1724
02:18:42,040 --> 02:18:44,440
Like I've never had the storms up.

1725
02:18:44,440 --> 02:18:48,120
Well, also we don't like get tropical storms here in the Sacramento, you know, Northern

1726
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:48,760
California.

1727
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:52,040
We have a very unique kind of weather pattern because we don't really get those same type

1728
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:52,600
of things.

1729
02:18:52,600 --> 02:18:56,280
I think we're supposed to be getting rain finally on like Tuesday or Wednesday in the

1730
02:18:56,280 --> 02:18:58,120
distance, maybe even tonight.

1731
02:18:58,120 --> 02:19:03,000
I wonder if it's the remnants of this trouble because, you know, Act F is, I believe in

1732
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:08,040
Mexicali, if I remember right, which is kind of like it's it's basically south of California,

1733
02:19:08,040 --> 02:19:10,200
but it's not like Tijuana is way on the west.

1734
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:13,640
It's a little more eastern than that, you know, and it's kind of south.

1735
02:19:13,640 --> 02:19:17,400
So, um, I wonder if the storm is big enough where we're getting like remnants of it

1736
02:19:17,400 --> 02:19:17,960
up here.

1737
02:19:17,960 --> 02:19:18,460
Maybe.

1738
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:19,320
Yeah.

1739
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:21,640
Well, be careful if there's thunder attached to that.

1740
02:19:21,640 --> 02:19:23,640
Sounds, uh, it sounds like it could be dangerous.

1741
02:19:23,640 --> 02:19:24,040
Anyway.

1742
02:19:24,040 --> 02:19:27,320
Um, you were talking about, uh, the PlayStation games.

1743
02:19:27,320 --> 02:19:27,640
Yeah.

1744
02:19:27,640 --> 02:19:29,560
For, uh, PlayStation plus.

1745
02:19:29,560 --> 02:19:29,880
Yes.

1746
02:19:29,880 --> 02:19:30,600
Orange launch radio.

1747
02:19:30,600 --> 02:19:31,400
All one word on Skype.

1748
02:19:31,400 --> 02:19:31,800
If you want to get.

1749
02:19:31,800 --> 02:19:36,840
So Xbox, um, I mentioned Overcooked and Victor Brown and then on the Xbox 360 compatible

1750
02:19:36,920 --> 02:19:41,240
games, Stuntman Ignition and Hitman Blood Money will be October's games.

1751
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:47,960
Um, Nintendo has won a lawsuit against some Tokyo company that runs a service called,

1752
02:19:47,960 --> 02:19:55,080
um, Maricar, which is, uh, basically tours through Tokyo in go-karts dressed up like

1753
02:19:55,080 --> 02:19:57,720
Mario Kart characters, which sounds awesome.

1754
02:19:57,720 --> 02:20:03,240
And, uh, so they are going to stop doing that because they, you know, filed, um, are fine

1755
02:20:03,240 --> 02:20:04,120
against them.

1756
02:20:04,120 --> 02:20:06,360
But to get your Mario Kart experience.

1757
02:20:06,360 --> 02:20:11,240
So the Nam Bandai Man Namco is going to be bringing over Mario Kart VR to the U S pretty

1758
02:20:11,240 --> 02:20:11,560
soon.

1759
02:20:11,560 --> 02:20:12,120
Oh, cool.

1760
02:20:12,120 --> 02:20:14,040
I'm starting in Washington, DC.

1761
02:20:14,040 --> 02:20:16,840
It's coming to their VR zone.

1762
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:18,760
Um, it's like an arcade thing.

1763
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:19,240
Yes.

1764
02:20:19,240 --> 02:20:20,440
Have you ever been down to that?

1765
02:20:20,440 --> 02:20:23,880
Um, I always want to call it punch trunk, but this is punch bowl social.

1766
02:20:23,880 --> 02:20:26,200
Have you been to that place that it's by the new arena?

1767
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:31,720
So they have like these VR things cause you can, you can, um, uh, rent the VR headset.

1768
02:20:31,720 --> 02:20:33,880
It's like right next to these other arcade games.

1769
02:20:34,520 --> 02:20:36,040
The arcade isn't super impressive.

1770
02:20:36,040 --> 02:20:38,600
It's like a couple of skee-ball machines, a couple of pinball machines and some classics.

1771
02:20:38,600 --> 02:20:41,320
But I think it's interesting to have the VR arcade right next to that.

1772
02:20:41,320 --> 02:20:44,360
And it looks like you can rent the headset for a little while and you, you can play that

1773
02:20:44,360 --> 02:20:44,920
one.

1774
02:20:44,920 --> 02:20:45,960
Bobby will know what I'm talking about.

1775
02:20:45,960 --> 02:20:49,640
What's the, what's the music game with the blue and the orange shields that you hold

1776
02:20:49,640 --> 02:20:52,760
up to absorb that, that that's one of the games.

1777
02:20:52,760 --> 02:20:54,120
Not beat saver.

1778
02:20:54,120 --> 02:20:55,480
No, it's not beat saver.

1779
02:20:55,480 --> 02:20:58,600
It's kind of pre-dates that is earlier than that.

1780
02:20:59,320 --> 02:21:01,000
I think beat saver would be more exciting.

1781
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:01,640
Audio shield.

1782
02:21:01,640 --> 02:21:01,960
That's it.

1783
02:21:01,960 --> 02:21:02,440
Thank you, Bobby.

1784
02:21:02,440 --> 02:21:03,240
I knew you'd know it.

1785
02:21:03,240 --> 02:21:05,480
So audio shields, the one that they're playing on that.

1786
02:21:05,480 --> 02:21:10,200
I, this Mario Kart VR though, if you watch people playing that, I bet there'd be tons

1787
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:11,240
of people lined up for that.

1788
02:21:11,240 --> 02:21:11,880
Yeah.

1789
02:21:11,880 --> 02:21:12,840
Heck yeah.

1790
02:21:12,840 --> 02:21:13,340
That's cool.

1791
02:21:14,600 --> 02:21:19,720
Um, and then of course there's news saying that there's gonna be a new track coming to

1792
02:21:19,720 --> 02:21:20,840
kingdom hearts three.

1793
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:25,160
It's a collaboration between Skrillex and Hikaru Tada.

1794
02:21:25,800 --> 02:21:26,360
Sorry.

1795
02:21:26,360 --> 02:21:27,000
Jumping in real quick.

1796
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,720
Cause I think this is a good comment in our chat at live.fognetwork.com.

1797
02:21:29,800 --> 02:21:33,240
Bob coffee says, I'm willing to bet Nintendo shut them down because Mario Kart is going

1798
02:21:33,240 --> 02:21:35,960
to be one of the rides and Nintendo land at universal.

1799
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:40,760
Well, it was that in that they were hitting, they were accidentally crashing into pedestrians

1800
02:21:40,760 --> 02:21:41,480
and stuff like that.

1801
02:21:41,480 --> 02:21:44,600
And so it was kind of making a bad name for a marker.

1802
02:21:44,600 --> 02:21:45,880
That would be a way to end your day.

1803
02:21:46,760 --> 02:21:47,000
Anyway.

1804
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:47,960
Sorry to interrupt you, Loki.

1805
02:21:48,760 --> 02:21:53,480
Um, and then, yeah, so there was going to be a new track coming called face my fears,

1806
02:21:53,480 --> 02:21:58,120
um, which is going to be sometime soon that they're going to debut that.

1807
02:21:58,760 --> 02:21:59,080
All right.

1808
02:21:59,080 --> 02:22:00,920
Let's go to the Skype line and take another call.

1809
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:01,080
Hi.

1810
02:22:01,080 --> 02:22:01,960
You're on orange launch radio.

1811
02:22:01,960 --> 02:22:02,360
Who's this?

1812
02:22:03,080 --> 02:22:06,600
Hey, uh, uh, uh, uh, this is raging leader.

1813
02:22:06,600 --> 02:22:06,920
Yes.

1814
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:07,640
What's up raging air.

1815
02:22:07,640 --> 02:22:08,200
What's in your mind?

1816
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:10,040
Uh, not too much.

1817
02:22:10,040 --> 02:22:15,400
Uh, two things, uh, to touch on, uh, the whole files, that thing that you were talking about

1818
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:15,960
earlier.

1819
02:22:15,960 --> 02:22:16,840
Fuck my life.

1820
02:22:16,840 --> 02:22:17,080
Yeah.

1821
02:22:18,120 --> 02:22:18,440
All right.

1822
02:22:19,080 --> 02:22:25,240
As much as I would love to agree with you 100%, I'll do so unofficially.

1823
02:22:26,200 --> 02:22:30,120
Uh, it's already tired and old and overdone.

1824
02:22:30,120 --> 02:22:36,520
It wasn't even funny to begin with, but there is a little bit of a hiccup.

1825
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:47,800
Um, looks like my significant other is jumping on board, uh, board, uh, you know, uh, train

1826
02:22:47,800 --> 02:22:49,000
to stop.

1827
02:22:49,880 --> 02:22:50,600
Yeah.

1828
02:22:50,600 --> 02:22:57,400
So officially I have to support her and her decision to do it.

1829
02:22:57,400 --> 02:23:03,960
So you don't have to, well, you can say that you have moral and religious objections now.

1830
02:23:03,960 --> 02:23:08,680
Now I feel it's very important to support our significant others, especially when it

1831
02:23:08,680 --> 02:23:11,960
has to do with dressing up like scantily clad video game characters.

1832
02:23:11,960 --> 02:23:14,040
So I am all for this.

1833
02:23:15,240 --> 02:23:15,640
Yeah.

1834
02:23:15,640 --> 02:23:21,640
Well, I was going to say, well, there is that aspect, but if I ever want her to lay a single

1835
02:23:21,640 --> 02:23:25,080
finger on me, I'm going to support her.

1836
02:23:25,080 --> 02:23:28,920
100%, uh, therefore it's the greatest thing in the world.

1837
02:23:29,560 --> 02:23:32,040
Um, so, ew.

1838
02:23:32,040 --> 02:23:34,920
But, uh, I'm sorry.

1839
02:23:34,920 --> 02:23:35,320
Ew.

1840
02:23:35,320 --> 02:23:37,640
I didn't, anyway, yes.

1841
02:23:37,640 --> 02:23:37,880
Okay.

1842
02:23:37,880 --> 02:23:41,480
So is this just about Bowsette and your lady friend or is there, is there something else

1843
02:23:41,480 --> 02:23:42,120
here?

1844
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:47,320
Well, you know, there, um, uh, there's a second thing, but, uh, I want to lead off.

1845
02:23:47,320 --> 02:23:47,560
Yeah.

1846
02:23:47,560 --> 02:23:48,120
Second thing.

1847
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:48,600
Let's do it.

1848
02:23:49,240 --> 02:23:56,280
Oh, well, I can't remember if I brought this up the last time I called you short or not,

1849
02:23:56,280 --> 02:24:00,680
but just in case I didn't, um, Lily is a gamer.

1850
02:24:00,680 --> 02:24:01,240
You brought it up.

1851
02:24:02,040 --> 02:24:09,240
Oh, well, um, uh, one thing I would like to ask is, do you know of any co-op games that,

1852
02:24:09,240 --> 02:24:14,920
uh, we could play that's on PC that cancel, you know, towards horror?

1853
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:19,480
Uh, you, you kind of did ask about the horror thing, but no, you didn't ask about co-op,

1854
02:24:19,480 --> 02:24:23,800
I guess the co-op horror game that's, uh, co-op get, get that PlayStation plus, uh,

1855
02:24:23,800 --> 02:24:24,680
Friday the 13th.

1856
02:24:25,400 --> 02:24:26,840
Well, yeah, there's that.

1857
02:24:26,840 --> 02:24:32,040
And then there's also, it's not really a horror game per se, but, uh, don't starve is kind

1858
02:24:32,040 --> 02:24:36,600
of got that, you know, it's got a little bit of like Adam's family macabre vibe.

1859
02:24:36,600 --> 02:24:37,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1860
02:24:37,640 --> 02:24:39,880
Yeah, she does have don't starve together.

1861
02:24:39,880 --> 02:24:45,480
And in fact, uh, we were playing dad, uh, probably within the past week or so.

1862
02:24:46,200 --> 02:24:49,800
Uh, you know, you know, it, it's a decent game.

1863
02:24:49,800 --> 02:24:52,280
Unfortunately, I suck at it.

1864
02:24:52,280 --> 02:24:57,880
What's the one everybody is fucking playing with the, the different roster of serial killers

1865
02:24:57,880 --> 02:25:00,360
and like everybody's streaming it on Twitch dead, dead by daylight.

1866
02:25:00,360 --> 02:25:01,000
Is that what it's called?

1867
02:25:01,720 --> 02:25:02,840
Is that what I'm thinking of me?

1868
02:25:02,840 --> 02:25:03,960
That sounds familiar.

1869
02:25:03,960 --> 02:25:05,480
I think that's the one I'm thinking of.

1870
02:25:05,480 --> 02:25:09,720
Um, where like you can play as like the shape from Halloween and Laurie Strode and all this

1871
02:25:09,720 --> 02:25:10,360
shit.

1872
02:25:10,360 --> 02:25:13,160
And like, it's, it's, it's like a four V one thing.

1873
02:25:14,040 --> 02:25:16,200
It's a similar formula to the Friday the 13th.

1874
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:17,240
That sounds cool.

1875
02:25:17,240 --> 02:25:18,120
I didn't know what that was.

1876
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:18,280
No.

1877
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:18,520
Yeah.

1878
02:25:18,520 --> 02:25:19,320
It's, Oh God.

1879
02:25:19,320 --> 02:25:20,920
It's, it's all over Twitch.

1880
02:25:20,920 --> 02:25:21,160
Yeah.

1881
02:25:21,160 --> 02:25:21,800
Dead by daylight.

1882
02:25:21,800 --> 02:25:21,960
Thank you.

1883
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:22,520
Sue Deberry.

1884
02:25:22,520 --> 02:25:23,240
I thought that's what it was.

1885
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:25,240
Oh, all right.

1886
02:25:25,240 --> 02:25:25,480
Yeah.

1887
02:25:25,480 --> 02:25:26,920
I'll definitely look into that.

1888
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:30,760
Um, now I want to help her build up her, uh, steam library.

1889
02:25:30,760 --> 02:25:36,360
Her steam library is a little smaller compared to mine, which is kind of a no dust.

1890
02:25:36,360 --> 02:25:37,320
It's not the size.

1891
02:25:37,320 --> 02:25:38,280
It's how you use it.

1892
02:25:39,080 --> 02:25:39,320
Yeah.

1893
02:25:39,880 --> 02:25:45,240
Um, yeah, the only thing she, you know, she, uh, Syphon, uh, don't stop together.

1894
02:25:45,240 --> 02:25:50,120
The only thing she, uh, he has that's co-op is portal two and she hasn't touched that

1895
02:25:50,120 --> 02:25:50,680
forever.

1896
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:54,840
So, uh, but it's not exactly a scary game either, but it's fun.

1897
02:25:54,840 --> 02:25:55,080
Yes.

1898
02:25:56,040 --> 02:25:56,520
Yeah.

1899
02:25:56,520 --> 02:25:56,840
Yeah.

1900
02:25:56,840 --> 02:25:57,800
No doubt about it.

1901
02:25:57,800 --> 02:25:58,600
It is fun.

1902
02:25:58,920 --> 02:26:04,040
But, uh, you know, since she's really having to the horror games now, I'll definitely look

1903
02:26:04,040 --> 02:26:04,760
into that.

1904
02:26:04,760 --> 02:26:06,520
Rage Nader, I'm going to tell you what not to do.

1905
02:26:07,240 --> 02:26:10,600
Don't get Mario party because that will end in divorce.

1906
02:26:12,040 --> 02:26:16,680
Well, we're, you know, we have to get married first and besides she doesn't have any consoles

1907
02:26:16,680 --> 02:26:18,360
anyways, just PC only.

1908
02:26:18,360 --> 02:26:19,880
So it is just a joke.

1909
02:26:19,880 --> 02:26:20,200
All right.

1910
02:26:21,560 --> 02:26:23,240
Tons of cool characters in there.

1911
02:26:23,240 --> 02:26:23,880
Yeah.

1912
02:26:23,880 --> 02:26:24,280
All right.

1913
02:26:24,280 --> 02:26:25,720
Uh, Rage Nader, I'm going to let you go.

1914
02:26:25,720 --> 02:26:26,760
So, uh, take care.

1915
02:26:26,760 --> 02:26:27,000
Okay.

1916
02:26:27,640 --> 02:26:27,880
All right.

1917
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:28,440
Have a good one.

1918
02:26:28,440 --> 02:26:28,680
All right.

1919
02:26:28,680 --> 02:26:29,240
Bye.

1920
02:26:29,240 --> 02:26:31,800
Like Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Leatherface.

1921
02:26:32,360 --> 02:26:32,600
Yeah.

1922
02:26:32,600 --> 02:26:35,640
They've got, well, it's a saw, but it jigsaw.

1923
02:26:36,440 --> 02:26:41,320
Um, I don't know who some of these, I think they just made up.

1924
02:26:41,880 --> 02:26:44,520
Yeah, they probably made some up and then the game was so good.

1925
02:26:44,520 --> 02:26:47,160
It got a bunch of like license stuff and so forth.

1926
02:26:47,160 --> 02:26:48,120
So pretty cool.

1927
02:26:48,120 --> 02:26:48,360
All right.

1928
02:26:48,360 --> 02:26:50,360
Orange launch radio, all one word on Skype.

1929
02:26:50,360 --> 02:26:53,000
Just a few more minutes to get in while Loki recaps other stuff.

1930
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,160
One more piece of news that's pretty important.

1931
02:26:55,880 --> 02:26:59,560
A very popular online game is getting a brand new expansion.

1932
02:26:59,560 --> 02:27:01,080
It's 25th expansion.

1933
02:27:01,080 --> 02:27:07,160
That is EverQuest is getting a brand new expansion called the Burning Lands.

1934
02:27:09,320 --> 02:27:10,680
And I thought that was pretty notable.

1935
02:27:10,680 --> 02:27:15,880
So, you know, it's going to have new monsters, new zones, items, raids, and more.

1936
02:27:16,680 --> 02:27:24,840
So yeah, time to fire up your EverQuest online account.

1937
02:27:24,840 --> 02:27:25,640
Or don't.

1938
02:27:25,640 --> 02:27:27,320
I mean, the choice is yours.

1939
02:27:29,320 --> 02:27:30,600
You can also not do that.

1940
02:27:33,320 --> 02:27:37,160
No, I get, I get, look, I get, I've been such a bitch, but I'm sure there's people

1941
02:27:37,160 --> 02:27:39,960
that play EverQuest out there that really enjoy it.

1942
02:27:39,960 --> 02:27:40,360
And that's cool.

1943
02:27:40,360 --> 02:27:42,920
Like if you invest all the time, it's like World of Warcraft.

1944
02:27:42,920 --> 02:27:45,400
I'm kind of like World of Warcraft is kind of old at this point.

1945
02:27:45,400 --> 02:27:48,440
It's showing its age, but like some people have invested so much time and stuff into

1946
02:27:48,440 --> 02:27:50,040
that, like they don't really want to let it go.

1947
02:27:50,040 --> 02:27:54,520
And I have to have a giant enemy snail because that is one of the new enemies.

1948
02:27:55,480 --> 02:27:57,400
There are snails in World of Warcraft.

1949
02:27:57,400 --> 02:28:00,280
World of Warcraft has those adorable llamas in the new expansion though.

1950
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:01,240
They're really cute.

1951
02:28:01,240 --> 02:28:02,920
So it does have that.

1952
02:28:02,920 --> 02:28:04,520
But do the llamas have crossbows?

1953
02:28:05,480 --> 02:28:06,760
Not yet, but maybe they'll work on that.

1954
02:28:06,760 --> 02:28:08,280
The Pandarians have crossbows.

1955
02:28:09,880 --> 02:28:11,000
No, no, I don't know.

1956
02:28:11,960 --> 02:28:12,460
All right.

1957
02:28:13,960 --> 02:28:15,640
Anyway, I guess it's going to do it.

1958
02:28:15,640 --> 02:28:18,840
We're not getting any other calls and I think Loki has ran through his last minute news.

1959
02:28:18,840 --> 02:28:21,560
So I think that is where we wrap up for the night.

1960
02:28:21,560 --> 02:28:24,360
But I want to thank you guys for tuning into our show and listening and participating

1961
02:28:24,360 --> 02:28:25,160
with us tonight.

1962
02:28:25,160 --> 02:28:28,360
If you didn't get through on Skype, but you want to still send us a shout, you can always

1963
02:28:28,360 --> 02:28:32,040
just participate at orangelaundradio.com, our email, or you can always tweet at us at

1964
02:28:32,040 --> 02:28:32,680
OLR.

1965
02:28:32,680 --> 02:28:37,320
We're also on Facebook at facebook.com orangelaundradio, even if we're not posting on there.

1966
02:28:37,320 --> 02:28:40,840
I always every day I log into Facebook, it goes, you haven't engaged with your people

1967
02:28:40,840 --> 02:28:41,560
with orange laundry.

1968
02:28:41,560 --> 02:28:42,680
I'm like, I don't know what to say.

1969
02:28:42,680 --> 02:28:44,680
I guess I need to post more funny memes.

1970
02:28:44,680 --> 02:28:48,200
I need to steal content from other places because that's what people do on Facebook.

1971
02:28:48,200 --> 02:28:49,320
Is that what y'all want me to do?

1972
02:28:49,320 --> 02:28:53,480
I don't think anyone sees anything on Facebook because that shit gets buried underneath

1973
02:28:53,480 --> 02:28:54,680
advertisements and crap.

1974
02:28:54,680 --> 02:28:55,320
That's true.

1975
02:28:55,320 --> 02:28:56,200
That's true.

1976
02:28:56,200 --> 02:28:56,700
All right.

1977
02:28:57,320 --> 02:29:00,360
So I guess that's going to do it for another episode of the show.

1978
02:29:00,360 --> 02:29:06,360
So let's go around and oh, before I get to final thoughts, I will say, as ever and always,

1979
02:29:06,360 --> 02:29:10,440
if you enjoy what you heard here at orange launch radio, please give us a five star review

1980
02:29:10,440 --> 02:29:12,680
on iTunes or Google play.

1981
02:29:12,680 --> 02:29:16,360
Cause those nice reviews go a very long way in helping spread the word about the show.

1982
02:29:16,360 --> 02:29:20,360
But you know what's even better telling a friend or two or five about the show, help

1983
02:29:20,360 --> 02:29:22,760
us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

1984
02:29:22,840 --> 02:29:24,600
But the voices aren't here to air.

1985
02:29:26,680 --> 02:29:29,080
It's going to be the same phone call every week.

1986
02:29:29,080 --> 02:29:29,580
Just kidding.

1987
02:29:30,280 --> 02:29:33,320
So anyway, I think that's it.

1988
02:29:33,320 --> 02:29:35,560
So I guess it's final thought time.

1989
02:29:35,560 --> 02:29:38,600
So my final thought tonight is I'm going to stream after the show.

1990
02:29:39,240 --> 02:29:42,840
I did a poll on my Twitter over at mr Rob Roberts.

1991
02:29:42,840 --> 02:29:47,240
And I think when I last checked classic NES stuff was winning for what we're going to

1992
02:29:47,240 --> 02:29:47,880
stream tonight.

1993
02:29:49,560 --> 02:29:51,240
Yeah, that's the winners classic NES stuff.

1994
02:29:51,240 --> 02:29:53,160
So that's what we're going to do tonight after the show.

1995
02:29:53,160 --> 02:29:57,640
So over at my Twitch channel, Rob Roberts, Loki, your final thought tonight.

1996
02:29:57,640 --> 02:30:00,920
I was hoping to work on more game development stuff this week.

1997
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:06,760
I've been really tired after doing a lot of exercising and crap and just, just haven't

1998
02:30:06,760 --> 02:30:11,240
had the intelligence to do it at late at night and just kind of sit down and watch TV.

1999
02:30:11,240 --> 02:30:14,280
So I got through maniac finally, which is pretty awesome on Netflix.

2000
02:30:14,280 --> 02:30:18,520
And also I recommend if you haven't checked it out yet, American Vandal is hilarious,

2001
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:19,560
especially season two.

2002
02:30:20,280 --> 02:30:26,280
Um, it's, it's a funny mockumentary type thing talking about like these like school,

2003
02:30:27,640 --> 02:30:29,160
like pranksters and stuff.

2004
02:30:29,160 --> 02:30:31,000
And it's, it's really funny to watch.

2005
02:30:31,560 --> 02:30:32,600
It's, it's fun.

2006
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:34,040
All right.

2007
02:30:34,040 --> 02:30:35,160
And maniacs pretty good too.

2008
02:30:36,120 --> 02:30:36,600
All right.

2009
02:30:36,600 --> 02:30:38,280
Well, we'll see you in seven days.

2010
02:30:38,280 --> 02:30:39,320
We'll do this all over again.

2011
02:30:39,320 --> 02:30:41,800
Our buddy Delvin from video game realness also going to be here next week.

2012
02:30:41,800 --> 02:30:43,880
So it's going to be a very, uh, screamy loud show.

2013
02:30:43,880 --> 02:30:47,800
It should be fun because Delvin and I, when we get around each other, so Loki will be

2014
02:30:47,800 --> 02:30:51,560
having a good, maybe our screams will, um, he's a big Nintendo fan too.

2015
02:30:51,560 --> 02:30:53,560
So that'd be really fun to have you guys in the same room.

2016
02:30:53,560 --> 02:30:54,200
So all right.

2017
02:30:54,200 --> 02:30:56,440
Yeah, it's on next week.

2018
02:30:56,440 --> 02:30:57,480
No, we're going to have a great show.

2019
02:30:57,480 --> 02:31:01,080
I look forward to, uh, you can't do anything dumb this week.

2020
02:31:02,520 --> 02:31:04,440
I mean, you're releasing super Mario party.

2021
02:31:04,440 --> 02:31:07,160
So I guess that's not entirely bad unless it's fucked up.

2022
02:31:07,160 --> 02:31:08,920
And then in which case you'll hear.

2023
02:31:08,920 --> 02:31:09,800
All right, we're out.

2024
02:31:09,800 --> 02:31:11,880
We'll see what happens in seven days when we see you next time.

2025
02:31:11,880 --> 02:31:14,280
