26000	28000	Wherever Gamer has a voice.
28000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
30000	32000	Hi fam, welcome back
32000	36000	It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
36000	38000	Orange Lounge Radio
38000	40000	Live tonight September the 23rd, 2018
40000	42000	Episode number 745 of our show
42000	48000	My name's Rob Roberts joining you live here from our headquarters in Sacramento, California
48000	51000	with my co-host as he's been every week here lately
51000	52000	Say hello to Techmaster Loki
52000	53000	Hello
53000	54000	Hi Loki, how are you doing?
54000	55000	I'm good
55000	59000	So no food tonight, this diet thing you've been on is like a serious thing
59000	61000	It's not that, I mean
61000	64000	Well I see you have like a protein shake, you're doing the same thing my husband does
64000	71000	No, it's just I ate lunch late, I cooked, I had some chicken I bought last week so I had to cook it before it went bad
71000	75000	And so I ate that for lunch at like 2.33 so I mean
75000	80000	It's kind of too early to eat again and I thought well I can have like a taco or something like that
80000	85000	But it was a chicken taco, I'm like I just ate chicken, I don't really want to eat that again
85000	87000	So I don't know
87000	93000	The last few days I've been trying to come in under a thousand calories under my already 500 calorie
93000	96000	Under my limit of what I'm supposed to eat
96000	98000	Well just don't overdo it with some of those cutting corners
98000	105000	Well like yesterday I ate a whole pizza so then I had to play DDR for 90 minutes straight
105000	108000	So maybe it's like a weekly budget, I see how it goes
108000	112000	No no no, that was just a slip but no
112000	119000	Lately it's been, because I got a Fitbit for my birthday so I've been doing a lot more walking
119000	125000	So I walk 3 miles a day, well during the week, not necessarily on the weekends because I don't have time for that
125000	131000	The 3 miles during the day, I fast for 16 hours up until about 1pm
131000	136000	So I don't eat until 1pm and then I go for a 3 mile walk and then I pick up lunch
136000	142000	And I come back and then I come home after all that and then I play DDR for another 30 minutes or so
142000	146000	So for those that, you know, I don't think we've talked about this in quite a while but
146000	150000	Loki's really like slimmed down, I know it's a radio show at least for now
150000	153000	I mean we talked about how we're going to move to Twitch eventually but
153000	158000	Because I bought new pants is why, because these pants actually fit and not the other ones
158000	161000	The other ones are really baggy and like were too big
161000	163000	You've really slimmed down though, you've really slimmed down
163000	169000	I really haven't, I mean thank you but the scale says otherwise
169000	173000	Well since you started this whole thing, I don't mean like in the past week or two
173000	175000	I mean since you started this whole thing, anyway
175000	181000	We're keeping somebody waiting over there, unfortunately we've missed her these past few weeks
181000	186000	But she's back to terrorize us once again, say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers
186000	192000	I'm overwhelmed by being back
193000	195000	And all of the stuff that Ikuma sent us
195000	200000	Oh yes, so right before the show, one of our pals from overseas, Akuma JP, shout out
200000	202000	Sent a little care package
202000	203000	A little?
203000	207000	It ended up being a big care package, so a big thank you to Akuma JP and all these little
207000	209000	You can send him all the pumpkin spice things
209000	214000	I don't know if pumpkin spice is as big as a thing, but you can get kapocha
214000	217000	That's what I could send him in return, I could say here's a little taste of America
217000	219000	And just do like all the pumpkin spice garbage
219000	221000	Send him the ultimate white girl fantasy?
221000	226000	Yes, ultimate like now Akuma JP I know it's your fantasy to be a basic bitch, so here you go
226000	230000	That was like that Cinderella meme, it was like at midnight your character turns back into a pumpkin
230000	232000	Yes bitch
232000	234000	That is me, here's the thing
234000	238000	Here's the thing, it's not that like I'm obsessed with pumpkin spice
238000	243000	I think I'm just the only one in the group of friends that's like willing to admit it
243000	246000	Like fuck yes I'm excited pumpkin spice is in season
246000	248000	Hell yes I'm gonna order a pumpkin spice latte
248000	250000	You know why? Because pumpkin spice lattes are fucking good
250000	252000	I'm gonna be making pumpkin bread
252000	254000	And so I get teased for being that bitch
254000	256000	I'm not making it sweet
256000	258000	I like a lot of different food
258000	260000	Anyway it's not the food podcast Dark Sakura
260000	262000	Yes it is
262000	263000	I actually
263000	265000	I just ate filet mignon and it was great
265000	268000	Want me to talk about meat and potatoes? The meat and potato show
268000	270000	Have sweet potato, eat it
270000	273000	I need to go to our social media because over on Twitter
273000	275000	At twitter.com slash olr
275000	277000	I actually asked the listeners
277000	279000	I gave Twitter a little love and I said
279000	283000	She's in the studio tonight on a brief reprieve from her work schedule
283000	287000	Which of these recent headlines from the shows she's missed
287000	289000	Should Rob ask her about right at the top of the show
289000	291000	So you ready for what the listeners picked
291000	294000	For the video game topic that you've missed that we need to get into
294000	296000	With 87% of the vote
296000	301000	What are your thoughts on the new Animal Crossing game for Nintendo Switch being announced
301000	303000	It must happen, I need it
303000	305000	And it has to be as great as New Leaf was
306000	308000	And I have to be able to have
308000	311000	Going to all the villages and changing their shit
313000	314000	And planting stuff
314000	316000	I want more black tulips
318000	320000	And I want to be able to murder Tom Nook in his sleep
320000	322000	How about bug net violence
323000	326000	I want to be able to kick people out of my village
326000	328000	Banish people from the village
328000	329000	I want to banish people from my village
329000	331000	Do you want witch trials
331000	334000	No not that bad I just want to kick Ed out when he shows up
336000	339000	You know I create backstories for all the characters in the game
339000	341000	It's not the Animal Crossing game that I want
341000	344000	It's Animal Crossing after dark that I really want
345000	348000	I do want more villagers to be like night owls
350000	352000	Yeah I always hated when the villagers would go to bed
352000	354000	Like at the time that I want to play the game
354000	357000	I want there to be like 24 hour shopping
357000	362000	That isn't just like the club
362000	364000	Like club lol
365000	368000	So did you watch that whole little thing with the Isabelle reveal
368000	370000	And the new Animal Crossing
370000	372000	Like that whole little thing on Nintendo Direct
372000	373000	Did you watch the actual teaser
373000	375000	I just cared that they said Animal Crossing
375000	377000	And that apparently Isabelle is in Smash Brothers
377000	378000	Yes Isabelle is in Smash Brothers
378000	379000	So the whole thing
379000	380000	What are you going to do
380000	382000	Beat people up with you know bills and park projects
382000	383000	Yes
383000	385000	Well the villagers are in the game
385000	387000	And the villagers are in the game
387000	388000	So why not Isabelle
388000	389000	It made a lot of sense
389000	391000	But the whole set up was that it started with
391000	393000	And people are supposed to be misled to think
393000	395000	Oh it's an Animal Crossing reveal
395000	397000	But in fact it was Isabelle is in Smash
397000	398000	And that's how it started
398000	400000	But then it fades to black
400000	401000	And it fades back up
401000	403000	And it's Tom Nook sitting at the computer
403000	405000	Which has lent itself to so many wonderful memes
405000	407000	By the way those images of Tom Nook sitting at the computer
407000	409000	And then he talks to the camera
409000	411000	And reveals that Animal Crossing is under development
411000	412000	For next year for the Switch
412000	413000	And that's where that came from
413000	415000	So it's kind of like a back to back
415000	417000	Better not be more fucking happy home designer
417000	418000	Even though I love that game too
418000	419000	It got old though
420000	421000	Alright so there you go
421000	423000	Jamie's thoughts on Animal Crossing
423000	424000	In a word, yes
424000	425000	Where's my NES games
425000	427000	What if we get SNES games that'd be rad
427000	429000	Oh like in the
429000	431000	Free stuff for Nintendo
431000	433000	Those days are long gone
433000	434000	I know
434000	435000	It would be nice
435000	438000	You have to pay a monthly or yearly fee
438000	440000	To be able to play those classic NES games
440000	442000	That were free in the original Animal Crossing
442000	444000	What if they had an arcade like in there
444000	448000	And you like pay like a certain amount of like Nintendo points
448000	450000	To go into the arcade and play stuff
450000	452000	I've always been about like how
452000	455000	Don't they have a big enough development team at Nintendo
455000	458000	That a couple people could just be assigned to making little mini games
458000	459000	And they don't have to make it
459000	461000	Just make NES style mini games
461000	462000	And those would be what you would unlock
462000	463000	And it would just be like
463000	464000	Flappy Bird ripoffs
464000	465000	And you know like
465000	466000	Those types of things
466000	467000	But like with the little villagers
467000	470000	And you could like have high score competitions
470000	471000	With the villagers
471000	473000	Or your friends that you invited to the village
473000	475000	There's the fishing competition
475000	478000	And the tortomers island crap
478000	479000	Okay alright that's true
479000	481000	They have some of those silly little things
481000	482000	That's true
482000	483000	Yeah
483000	484000	So alright we'll see
484000	485000	Going to our chat
485000	487000	We do tape live of course every Sunday night
487000	488000	At the voice of geeks network
488000	489000	Of vognetwork.com
489000	490000	And if you are in our
490000	491000	Or if you are listening live
491000	492000	You should be in our chat room
492000	494000	It's over at live.vognetwork.com
494000	496000	All the info how to join our chat room
496000	497000	Is right there
497000	499000	Starting off SHG100 Matt saying
499000	501000	I would watch Jamie stream Animal Crossing
501000	503000	You gonna be doing any live streaming of
503000	504000	Oh shit yeah
504000	505000	Okay sounds good
505000	507000	You know something else just occurred to me
507000	509000	Because they let you do that in like
509000	511000	In the camp game
511000	512000	Pocket camp
512000	514000	You should be able to choose your skin tone
514000	515000	For your character
515000	516000	Instead of like
516000	517000	I mean you should still be able to like
517000	518000	Tan if you go to the beach and everything
518000	519000	Right
519000	520000	But you should be able to like
520000	521000	Choose your skin tone
521000	522000	Instead of it being like
522000	524000	Because I know that the intent is for
524000	526000	Everyone to be Japanese
526000	527000	I mean because
527000	530000	But when it comes out in a diverse place
530000	532000	In a more diverse location
532000	534000	It looks like default white
534000	535000	You know
535000	536000	Right right
536000	537000	And I think that they should definitely
537000	538000	Put in more
538000	540000	Choices of skin tone that you can pick
540000	541000	From the start of the game
541000	542000	Well I think Nintendo's been hearing
542000	543000	Some of that feedback
543000	544000	Because of what we're seeing
544000	545000	In the mobile game and stuff
545000	547000	So I would anticipate that's gonna continue
547000	548000	Into whatever you know
548000	549000	New Animal Crossing game comes out
549000	550000	And all that
550000	551000	So we'll see though
551000	552000	Let's see
552000	553000	Fifth Dream in chat says
553000	554000	It better have big text
554000	556000	So I can play it at work
556000	557000	That's a good call out
557000	559000	Is that since it is going to be something
559000	560000	That's designed to be portable
560000	561000	And docked
562000	563000	We will want to make sure
563000	564000	That the text is readable
564000	565000	When we're sitting there
565000	567000	Playing it in portable mode
567000	569000	I want my amiibos to work
569000	570000	I'm sure the
570000	571000	Oh come on
571000	572000	I want the villager amiibo
572000	573000	For Smash Brothers to work
573000	575000	Amiibo support is probably like
575000	576000	The first thing they thought about
576000	577000	In one of those meetings
577000	579000	How can we get more cash from our fans
579000	581000	Did you see how many are still left over
581000	583000	At target in those places
583000	585000	Because I think the bubble's bursting
585000	586000	A little bit on that
586000	587000	I kind of think the amiibo pool
587000	588000	Got too dilated
588000	590000	Like they did not need to make
590000	591000	I know you're not going to like this Jamie
591000	593000	But they did not need to make figures
593000	595000	For like every character in Animal Crossing
595000	596000	They did not need to make figures
596000	598000	For all of Kirby's friends
598000	600000	I need five different KK's
600000	602000	So like that's the problem
602000	604000	Is I think it just got too saturated
604000	605000	Like the Smash Brothers series
605000	606000	That was good
606000	607000	But that should have been like
607000	609000	That should have been the amiibo
609000	610000	You know maybe a couple others
610000	611000	Here and there like
611000	613000	But I have my Mr. Resetti
613000	614000	I know I know
614000	615000	But it's just I just think it's
615000	616000	It's too much
616000	617000	It's too much
617000	618000	And act up I agree
618000	619000	There's never enough Kirby amiibos
619000	620000	There's always going to be someone
620000	621000	That disagrees with me
621000	622000	Let's get to our kickoff topic
622000	623000	Tonight officially
623000	627000	Even though the losers here
627000	630000	Twitch Prime changes 13% of the vote
630000	632000	Steam TV 0% of the vote
632000	634000	Jamie nobody cares about your opinion
634000	635000	On Steam TV apparently
635000	638000	I don't care about Steam TV either
638000	640000	Apparently Animal Crossing
640000	643000	Is just too dominating there
643000	644000	People want to know
644000	645000	People associate you with that game
645000	646000	I can't imagine why
646000	647000	Alright anyway
647000	648000	Let's talk about our official kickoff
648000	649000	Topic tonight
649000	650000	Let's get into
650000	651000	Actually unfortunately
651000	652000	This is kind of like shitty news
652000	653000	And it's
653000	654000	This is something that is inevitable
654000	655000	In the games industry
655000	657000	And something we hear far too often about
657000	659000	But I think in this particular stance
659000	660000	Actually both
660000	661000	We're going to hear about two tonight
661000	663000	Kind of a surprise I think
663000	665000	Jamie why don't you start us off
665000	667000	So we had a studio closure right
667000	668000	And this was
668000	669000	Kind of I don't know
669000	670000	Feels like a surprise
670000	671000	To me
671000	672000	It's kind of a surprise
672000	673000	But I also think it's karma
673000	675000	Telltale is closing
675000	679000	They are starting by laying off
679000	681000	Most of the employees
681000	682000	Are leaving 25 there
682000	685000	To finish their obligations
685000	687000	But they said that more information
687000	688000	Is coming out in coming weeks
688000	690000	They also though apparently
690000	691000	Haven't been paying severance packages
691000	692000	To their employees
692000	694000	Not in this most recent round
694000	697000	Well I'm sure that the management
697000	698000	Is going to be paying themselves
698000	699000	A nice you know
699000	700000	Chunk of money
701000	702000	So fuck them
702000	703000	Allegedly
703000	704000	No likely
704000	705000	Because that's all
705000	706000	It's capital
706000	707000	We don't know
707000	708000	I have to say allegedly
708000	709000	Because we don't know
709000	710000	I just want to say
710000	711000	When you say
711000	712000	Because
712000	713000	She's unhinged
713000	714000	She's back and she's unhinged
714000	715000	Which is fine
715000	716000	But when you say
716000	717000	Karma
717000	718000	I have hinges
718000	719000	I think it's important to state
719000	721000	You are targeting the management
721000	722000	In that
722000	723000	And certainly
723000	724000	None of the hard working
724000	725000	Story writers
725000	726000	Programmers
726000	727000	People doing their jobs
727000	728000	My ire goes to the management
728000	729000	Because it's their fucking fault
729000	730000	Yeah
730000	731000	Their decisions
731000	732000	All I'll say
732000	734000	Is it's a small world
734000	735000	And
735000	737000	This comes from
737000	738000	Things that we've heard
738000	739000	And that's all we can say
739000	740000	So to the management
740000	742000	Of Telltale Games
742000	744000	I want you to take
744000	746000	A wrought iron dildo
746000	747000	Stop
747000	748000	Just stop
748000	749000	They can also be used
749000	750000	As a metal file
750000	751000	For blacksmithing
751000	752000	They can be used
752000	753000	As a metal file
753000	754000	For blacksmithing
754000	755000	And they like for you to sit on it
755000	756000	And spin
756000	757000	In the opposite direction
757000	758000	I just
758000	759000	I
759000	760000	I
760000	762000	The anger comes from a place
762000	763000	Of not only did they
763000	765000	Kind of do their associates dirty
765000	766000	With this whole lack of severance
766000	767000	And all this stuff
767000	768000	But
768000	769000	We've heard some accounts
769000	770000	On Twitter where
770000	772000	New employees left
772000	773000	Their long careers
773000	774000	To start
774000	776000	On Monday
776000	777000	And they were laid off
777000	778000	On Friday
778000	779000	Like
779000	780000	What kind of planning
780000	781000	Is that?
781000	782000	Like
782000	783000	What kind of planning
783000	784000	Is that?
784000	785000	That's
785000	786000	It's
786000	787000	It's just a real
787000	788000	It's a real crappy way
788000	789000	To treat somebody too
789000	790000	That would have left
790000	791000	Like a long career
791000	792000	To come work
792000	793000	At this company
793000	794000	Who's
794000	795000	You know
795000	796000	Making some good
796000	797000	Good stuff
797000	798000	You know
798000	799000	Tons of people love
799000	800000	The Walking Dead
800000	801000	And again
801000	802000	I want to stress
802000	803000	The anger does not come
803000	804000	From a place
804000	805000	Whatsoever
805000	806000	To the hardworking
806000	807000	Frontline programmers
807000	808000	Talented artists
808000	809000	Story writers
809000	810000	The management there
810000	811000	Is garbage
812000	813000	You can fertilize
813000	814000	The shit
814000	816000	This is landfill
816000	817000	The views and opinions
817000	818000	Expressed by Jamie
818000	819000	Are true
819000	820000	I have to say
820000	821000	That dildo smithing
821000	822000	Is one skill tree
822000	823000	That I didn't put
823000	824000	A lot of points in
824000	825000	In Skyrim
825000	826000	But
826000	827000	I may have to change
827000	828000	My mind on that
828000	829000	Maybe next time
829000	830000	Yeah next time
830000	831000	Next playthrough
831000	832000	Let's see
832000	833000	Go into chat
833000	834000	At live.vognetwork.com
834000	835000	As Joe and Hunter Matt
835000	836000	Points out
836000	837000	Those employees
837000	838000	Live in the San Francisco
838000	839000	Bay Area
839000	840000	The highest cost
840000	841000	Bay Area
841000	842000	The North Bay Area
842000	844000	Was where specifically
844000	845000	This office was located
845000	846000	Yeah
846000	847000	They were right near
847000	848000	I used to work
848000	849000	I keep wanting to say
849000	850000	Martinez
850000	851000	That's not it
851000	852000	What's on the
852000	853000	Just out of Marin
853000	854000	San
854000	855000	Oh San
855000	856000	God damn it
856000	857000	Why can't I think of the name
857000	858000	San Rafael
858000	859000	San Rafael
859000	860000	That's it
860000	861000	San Rafael
861000	862000	San Quentin
862000	863000	No
863000	864000	across there
864000	865000	San Rafael
865000	866000	That's where they were located
866000	867000	If I remember right
867000	868000	When I was arrested
868000	869000	I was dressed in black
869000	870000	I was there too
870000	871000	But um
871000	872000	Yeah Telltale
872000	873000	Was right in that area
873000	874000	And I'm telling you
874000	875000	North Bay Area
875000	876000	Expensive
876000	877000	Real estate
877000	878000	Very expensive
878000	879000	And Loki
879000	880000	Fifth Dream says
880000	881000	This is a Skyrim mod
881000	882000	Waiting to happen
882000	883000	I'm sure it's a Skyrim mod
883000	884000	Already happened
884000	885000	But you know
885000	887000	I haven't delved into all of those
887000	888000	And Bones 006
888000	890000	I said shit has uses
890000	892000	You can fertilize with shit
892000	893000	Garbage
893000	894000	Dungeon Buster in chat says
894000	895000	That's BS planning
895000	896000	Management had to know
896000	897000	That things were going south
897000	898000	And yet they let those
898000	899000	Newcomers come in
899000	901000	There's no way their finance people
901000	902000	Could not have already known
902000	904000	Well before the hires were made
904000	907000	And that's an example of
907000	909000	Why there's anger about this
909000	911000	And where that's coming from
911000	913000	You know you want a concrete example
913000	915000	Of how was the planning garbage
915000	916000	There's your answer
916000	918000	But for what it's worth
918000	920000	I know the studio did make some
920000	922000	Pretty amazing games
922000	924000	You know all things considered
924000	926000	Certainly the Walking Dead series
926000	928000	Known and appreciated by a lot of people
928000	930000	They made games based on Jurassic Park
930000	932000	They had the Sam and Max
932000	934000	Was kind of the big comeback series games
934000	936000	They had those strong bad games
936000	937000	That were on the Wii
937000	938000	Back to the Future
938000	939000	Back to the Future
939000	940000	They had the Batman
940000	941000	The Marvel stuff
941000	942000	Wolf Among Us
942000	943000	So I mean there was all
943000	945000	And I honestly thought
945000	947000	You know they were in good financial places
947000	948000	Because the types of games
948000	949000	They were putting out
949000	951000	Were in my view
951000	953000	Like long shelf life type of games
953000	955000	Like you know in a lot of games
955000	956000	Games have to sell
956000	958000	Like all of their business
958000	959000	It's like right up front
959000	961000	Like that's why pre-orders are so important
961000	963000	That's why launch day
963000	964000	Stuff is so important
964000	965000	Because so many games
965000	966000	Make their sales
966000	967000	Large percent of their sales
967000	968000	The first week
968000	971000	And I was always struck with
971000	973000	That Telltale games didn't necessarily
973000	974000	Have those same goals
974000	976000	Because they would
976000	978000	You know they had a long lifespan
978000	979000	Something like the Walking Dead
979000	980000	People are just now
980000	981000	Even getting into those games
981000	982000	I know and I still have
982000	983000	Like in my back catalog
983000	984000	In my PlayStation library
984000	985000	I think on PlayStation 3
985000	988000	I have like a ton of those series
988000	989000	But now again
989000	990000	If you want to believe
990000	991000	Everything you see on Twitter
991000	992000	And social media
992000	993000	So take it with a grain of salt
993000	994000	But apparently
994000	996000	Not all their games sold very well
996000	997000	Apparently the Minecraft
997000	999000	Story mode was doing very well
999000	1001000	That game was doing well
1001000	1004000	But the Batman game
1004000	1006000	Was one of their worst performing games period
1006000	1008000	And that's kind of a stunning one
1008000	1009000	In a way
1009000	1010000	I don't know though
1010000	1011000	But in some way
1011000	1012000	Like the DC movies
1013000	1014000	Have not been very strong
1014000	1015000	We all know that
1015000	1016000	That's because they're garbage
1016000	1017000	With garbage writing
1018000	1019000	You're on a roll tonight
1020000	1021000	The DC movies are not very strong
1021000	1022000	I also kind of think
1022000	1023000	Batman was saturated
1024000	1025000	I'm not sure there was a place
1025000	1028000	For Telltale's very specific sort of
1028000	1031000	Batman game in the mass market
1031000	1033000	You know what there was a place for?
1033000	1034000	Lego Batman
1034000	1035000	And I think that's
1035000	1036000	People kind of associate
1036000	1037000	The console gaming with like
1037000	1039000	Lego Batman and that stuff
1039000	1040000	I think the Batman Telltale thing
1040000	1041000	Proved to be maybe too niche
1041000	1042000	I don't know
1042000	1043000	Apparently Tales from the Borderlands
1043000	1044000	Also did not do well
1044000	1046000	But like I hate to say it
1046000	1047000	I kind of
1047000	1048000	I mean that's a
1048000	1049000	That was
1049000	1050000	I don't even remember thinking this
1050000	1051000	When I first saw the game
1051000	1053000	Like the game looked really good
1053000	1054000	But I was like
1054000	1056000	This is a really niche thing
1056000	1058000	Like I'm not going to want to play this
1058000	1060000	If I don't already have some familiarity
1060000	1062000	With Borderlands
1062000	1064000	But I think the thinking that went into it
1064000	1065000	Was the reverse
1065000	1066000	Maybe we can bring more people
1066000	1068000	Into Borderlands through this game
1068000	1070000	But I'm not sure that's how it really worked
1070000	1072000	Whether the game was good or not
1072000	1073000	I'm not saying it was a bad game
1073000	1074000	Actually
1074000	1076000	Considering I knew very little about Borderlands
1076000	1078000	I actually enjoyed
1078000	1080000	What Tales from the Borderlands I saw
1080000	1081000	But I just think that
1081000	1082000	You know kind of
1082000	1084000	Limited the potential audience
1084000	1085000	But hindsight's
1085000	1086000	2020 right?
1086000	1087000	So anyway
1087000	1090000	It probably leads to why
1090000	1092000	The games did not end up
1092000	1094000	Performing as well as expected
1094000	1096000	And why we're where we're at today
1096000	1097000	Let's see
1097000	1098000	Going to chat at
1098000	1099000	Live.vognetware.com
1099000	1100000	Yeah Dungeon Buster says
1100000	1102000	I thought the Batman games were doing really well
1102000	1104000	So to read that rumor was eyebrow raising right?
1104000	1105000	But we don't
1105000	1107000	We don't really get game sales
1107000	1109000	In the same way we get box office
1109000	1111000	I mean sure we get MPD rankings
1111000	1113000	But there's only so much that tells us
1113000	1115000	You know there's so many games out there
1115000	1117000	And plus with digital distribution
1117000	1118000	And all these different platforms
1118000	1120000	PC isn't accounted for in MPD
1120000	1121000	So it's just you know
1121000	1122000	A little different
1122000	1123000	Brad from Pod Culture
1123000	1125000	Pushing back on the DC movies thing a little bit
1125000	1127000	Does want to point out Wonder Woman was great
1127000	1128000	So
1128000	1129000	So
1129000	1131000	There is at least maybe a diamond in the rough
1131000	1134000	Well you know a broken clock is right twice
1136000	1137000	Alright anyway
1137000	1138000	It used to be good
1138000	1140000	It's just up until recent
1140000	1142000	When they tried the
1142000	1144000	You know Marvel Cinematic Universe the thing
1144000	1147000	And then actually brought in somebody from Marvel Cinematic Universe
1147000	1148000	But anyway this is not a
1148000	1149000	This is not a DC Marvel show
1149000	1150000	It's a video game show
1150000	1151000	Unfortunately
1151000	1152000	I will say
1152000	1154000	Actually to end this on a positive note
1154000	1156000	To see how the industry has been reaching out
1156000	1158000	To the affected folks at Telltale
1158000	1159000	Is really awesome
1159000	1161000	Like there's a tweet out there
1161000	1163000	Where Ubisoft San Francisco
1163000	1164000	Is like
1164000	1165000	Hey if you work there
1165000	1167000	Come to BJ's Brewhouse
1167000	1168000	On such and such day
1168000	1169000	We're meeting and greeting people
1169000	1170000	Our treat
1170000	1171000	You know to try to fill positions
1171000	1173000	And I think there's a lot of people out there
1173000	1174000	Who want to help
1174000	1175000	Because many people recognize
1175000	1176000	This sucks
1176000	1178000	Because there's many people in the industry
1178000	1179000	Who have been through this
1179000	1180000	Far too many times
1180000	1181000	Because of
1181000	1183000	Bad decisions
1183000	1184000	By people that were
1184000	1186000	A little higher up on the food chain
1186000	1187000	Unfortunately
1187000	1188000	This is not the only example
1188000	1189000	Of this that's happened this week
1189000	1190000	Right Logie?
1190000	1191000	Yes unfortunately not
1191000	1192000	So
1192000	1193000	Capcom's
1193000	1194000	Vancouver studio
1194000	1196000	Has shut down as well
1196000	1198000	So
1198000	1199000	This isn't kind of
1199000	1200000	Unexpected I guess
1200000	1201000	Because they did
1201000	1202000	Lay off
1202000	1203000	30% of the studio
1203000	1205000	Back in February
1205000	1206000	But
1206000	1207000	Now they have
1207000	1208000	I guess
1208000	1209000	The remaining
1209000	1210000	158 people
1210000	1211000	Will lose their jobs
1211000	1212000	Due to the shutdown
1212000	1213000	They're going to keep
1213000	1214000	A skeleton crew remaining
1214000	1216000	Until January 2019
1216000	1217000	To finalize the closure
1217000	1219000	Operations and logistics
1219000	1220000	But
1220000	1222000	For those who may not know
1222000	1223000	Capcom Vancouver
1223000	1225000	Was best known for the
1225000	1227000	Dead Rising series
1227000	1228000	But unfortunately
1228000	1229000	They said as a result
1229000	1231000	Of reviewing titles and development
1231000	1232000	At Capcom Vancouver
1232000	1233000	Capcom has decided to
1233000	1234000	Cancel the development
1234000	1235000	Of projects at the studio
1235000	1237000	And will concentrate development
1237000	1239000	On major titles in Japan
1239000	1240000	So
1240000	1241000	No more Dead Rising
1241000	1242000	At least
1242000	1243000	I guess not
1243000	1244000	Not from this studio
1244000	1245000	Yeah and they were doing
1245000	1246000	Dead Rising and I guess also
1246000	1247000	They had a
1247000	1248000	Puzzle Fighter
1248000	1249000	Was the other thing that they
1249000	1250000	Worked on
1250000	1251000	Oh and that game kind of
1251000	1252000	They already announced that
1252000	1253000	That game was going to close
1253000	1254000	Not that long ago
1254000	1255000	Yeah that game
1255000	1256000	I don't think did that
1256000	1257000	Well
1257000	1258000	Well
1258000	1259000	I think they went
1259000	1260000	The wrong model with it
1260000	1261000	Unfortunately
1261000	1262000	Yeah
1262000	1263000	But I thought the Puzzle Fighter
1263000	1264000	Was going to get a release
1264000	1265000	In kind of the
1265000	1266000	The more appropriate
1266000	1267000	You know pay
1267000	1268000	20 bucks up front
1268000	1269000	And get all the characters
1269000	1270000	Type of thing
1270000	1271000	I thought it was going to get
1271000	1272000	A release on Switch
1272000	1273000	PlayStation
1273000	1274000	I guess maybe not now
1274000	1275000	I don't know
1275000	1276000	I don't know
1276000	1277000	I don't know where that stands
1277000	1278000	It's also kind of nebulous
1278000	1279000	With the Telltale stuff
1279000	1280000	I think it's kind of a given
1280000	1281000	That
1281000	1282000	Well they have like
1282000	1283000	The stranger things
1283000	1284000	The Netflix stuff
1284000	1285000	Is not going to be happening
1285000	1286000	Yeah that's unfortunate
1286000	1287000	I mean
1287000	1288000	And ironically enough
1288000	1289000	I want to say
1289000	1292000	Let's see
1292000	1294000	There's a game actually
1294000	1295000	Coming out
1295000	1296000	In just a couple weeks
1296000	1298000	You know that's from Telltale
1298000	1300000	Batman the enemy within
1300000	1301000	On the Switch
1301000	1302000	Oops
1302000	1303000	Maybe
1303000	1304000	In the sequel to the
1304000	1305000	Other Batman series
1305000	1306000	Which is weird though
1306000	1307000	Because if like it did so terribly
1307000	1308000	You'd think that they wouldn't
1308000	1309000	Make a sequel to it
1309000	1310000	Or well
1310000	1311000	You know but also
1311000	1312000	It's one of those
1312000	1313000	You have to weigh the cost
1313000	1314000	Of how much to port it
1314000	1315000	Versus you know
1315000	1316000	What's the likely return
1316000	1317000	On you know
1317000	1318000	Going to another console
1318000	1319000	Like the Switch
1319000	1320000	And we've seen so many titles
1320000	1321000	Kind of end up getting ported
1321000	1322000	Over to the Switch
1322000	1323000	That they must think
1323000	1324000	There's you know
1324000	1325000	Money to be made there
1325000	1326000	I mean
1326000	1327000	And in the case of Telltale
1327000	1328000	Not to you know
1328000	1329000	Take the spotlight off
1329000	1330000	Which is important too
1330000	1331000	But
1331000	1332000	Telltale does still have a
1332000	1333000	Skeleton crew
1333000	1334000	We just don't know how
1334000	1335000	For how much longer
1335000	1336000	So assumably
1336000	1337000	This crew that's left
1337000	1338000	Is dealing with these
1338000	1339000	Commitments that are already
1339000	1341000	There such as the Batman thing
1341000	1343000	And whatever else is left
1343000	1344000	But
1344000	1345000	For the most part
1345000	1346000	The studio's done
1346000	1347000	Yeah
1347000	1348000	And so for Capcom Vancouver
1348000	1349000	It's done done
1349000	1350000	Right
1350000	1351000	They'll shift all that to
1351000	1352000	Japan and what have you
1352000	1353000	Yep
1353000	1354000	Well
1354000	1355000	That is unfortunate
1355000	1356000	Fifth Dream in chat
1356000	1358000	Over at live.vognetwork.com
1358000	1359000	It says
1359000	1360000	Man I was looking forward to
1360000	1361000	Puzzle Fighter
1361000	1362000	The mobile one literally had
1362000	1363000	A bug in the tutorial
1363000	1364000	That prevented me from
1364000	1365000	Ever playing
1365000	1366000	Then again
1366000	1367000	Maybe that's a sign of
1367000	1368000	Why it went poof
1368000	1369000	Um
1369000	1370000	When yeah
1370000	1371000	When bugs are reported
1371000	1372000	You definitely need to act
1372000	1373000	On those bugs
1373000	1374000	It's very fascinating
1374000	1375000	I just feel like
1375000	1376000	It seems like nowadays
1376000	1378000	Testing is so sloppy
1378000	1379000	Like with just this stuff
1379000	1380000	Or that they just push
1380000	1381000	Not necessarily maybe
1381000	1382000	That the testing's like
1382000	1383000	Yeah
1383000	1384000	They're just like
1384000	1385000	Eh it's fine
1385000	1386000	Let's just put it out
1386000	1387000	I think it's definitely
1387000	1388000	I think the testing
1388000	1389000	Isn't sloppy at all
1389000	1390000	I think the testing
1390000	1391000	Picks up a lot of stuff
1391000	1392000	I think sometimes
1392000	1393000	It's a question of
1393000	1394000	What are we willing to
1394000	1395000	Push the game back
1395000	1396000	To do
1396000	1397000	Um
1397000	1398000	To fix and so forth
1398000	1399000	And so uh
1399000	1400000	That is uh
1400000	1401000	That is
1401000	1402000	Had a very interesting
1402000	1403000	Effect here in the year
1403000	1404000	2018
1404000	1405000	Cause I think a lot of games
1405000	1406000	Have bugs that
1406000	1407000	Well and no
1407000	1408000	Get
1408000	1409000	They're identified in testing
1409000	1410000	But the game comes out anyway
1410000	1411000	I would bet
1411000	1412000	You know Bethesda's infamous
1412000	1413000	For all the bug stuff
1413000	1414000	I would bet so much of
1414000	1415000	That stuff gets called out
1415000	1416000	And they say
1416000	1417000	Um
1417000	1418000	We're gonna do it anyway
1418000	1419000	Because you know
1419000	1420000	Again it's
1420000	1421000	Cost to fix
1421000	1422000	And the time table
1422000	1423000	And are we gonna be able to
1423000	1424000	Meet the shipping day
1424000	1425000	And all that stuff
1425000	1426000	Because so many games
1426000	1427000	Have to be out in November
1427000	1428000	You gotta
1428000	1429000	That's why they don't
1429000	1430000	Bug fix
1430000	1431000	You know
1431000	1432000	Skyrim anymore
1432000	1433000	Oh but they'll fucking make
1433000	1434000	You know
1434000	1435000	More DLC that they can
1435000	1436000	Charge for
1436000	1437000	I mean
1437000	1438000	Mods
1438000	1439000	They can charge for
1439000	1440000	Well I'm hoping
1440000	1441000	You know
1441000	1442000	We've seen this happen
1442000	1443000	With movies
1443000	1444000	Over the past few years
1444000	1445000	That you get
1445000	1447000	Now not just in summer
1447000	1448000	And the winter
1448000	1449000	Holiday season
1449000	1450000	You're seeing
1450000	1451000	Big movies
1451000	1452000	Basically year round
1452000	1453000	You're seeing
1453000	1454000	Big big movies
1454000	1455000	Almost all times
1455000	1456000	Throughout the year
1456000	1457000	Except maybe early January
1457000	1458000	Is the one time
1458000	1459000	You don't really see
1459000	1460000	Big big movies
1460000	1461000	Anymore
1461000	1462000	But that's spreading
1462000	1463000	More year round
1463000	1464000	And I kind of hope
1464000	1465000	We're getting to a similar
1465000	1466000	Place with games
1466000	1467000	It sure feels like it
1467000	1468000	Especially amongst the years
1468000	1469000	We've done
1469000	1470000	OLR here
1470000	1471000	Is that I remember
1471000	1472000	It was like
1472000	1473000	All the games
1473000	1474000	Were in October
1474000	1475000	January
1475000	1476000	March
1476000	1477000	Fiscal year
1477000	1478000	Type of things
1478000	1479000	April
1479000	1480000	And so forth
1480000	1481000	We're getting stuff
1481000	1482000	Even in the summer
1482000	1483000	And so forth
1483000	1484000	We're getting like
1484000	1485000	A big release
1485000	1486000	At least every month
1486000	1487000	It's feeling a little bit
1487000	1488000	More year round
1488000	1489000	And maybe that's gonna
1489000	1490000	Help alleviate
1490000	1491000	Some of the pressures
1491000	1492000	From investors
1492000	1493000	To deliver a product
1493000	1494000	At a certain time
1494000	1495000	At the sake of
1495000	1496000	Keep the bugs in
1496000	1497000	You know what I mean
1497000	1498000	Yeah
1498000	1499000	So
1499000	1500000	It'll be interesting
1500000	1501000	Anyway
1501000	1502000	Let's see
1502000	1503000	Going to chat
1504000	1505000	Nope
1505000	1506000	It's just weird
1506000	1507000	When it happens
1507000	1508000	We can afford weird
1508000	1509000	Ship it
1509000	1510000	Let's see
1510000	1511000	Tigerclaw says
1511000	1512000	That's true
1512000	1513000	But even last year
1513000	1514000	Proved
1514000	1515000	You don't have
1515000	1516000	You don't have to
1516000	1517000	Release in the fall
1517000	1518000	To be remembered
1518000	1519000	For the Oscars
1519000	1520000	Get Out
1520000	1521000	I believe it had been
1521000	1522000	Released in like
1522000	1523000	February or March
1523000	1524000	It was earlier
1524000	1525000	In the year
1525000	1526000	And people remembered
1526000	1527000	How good it was
1527000	1528000	When awards season
1528000	1529000	Came around
1529000	1530000	So it doesn't
1530000	1531000	Always happen
1531000	1532000	But
1532000	1533000	You know
1533000	1534000	There's ways to
1534000	1535000	Remind voters too
1535000	1536000	You know what I mean
1536000	1537000	That's why you have
1537000	1538000	Those four year
1538000	1539000	Consideration campaigns
1539000	1541000	Around the Oscar season
1541000	1542000	Go to a website
1542000	1543000	Like deadline.com
1543000	1545000	Or variety.com
1545000	1546000	These are like
1546000	1547000	Industry
1547000	1548000	News wires
1548000	1549000	And they're
1549000	1550000	Targeted at people
1550000	1551000	In the industry
1551000	1552000	And look at the
1552000	1553000	Type of ads
1553000	1554000	That show up there
1554000	1555000	It's all this
1555000	1556000	Four year
1556000	1557000	Consideration stuff
1557000	1558000	Like all
1558000	1559000	All around awards season
1559000	1560000	Also don't ever
1560000	1561000	Ever ever ever
1561000	1562000	Look at TMZ
1562000	1564000	TMZ is where you go
1564000	1565000	When you want like
1565000	1566000	Gutter trash rumors
1566000	1567000	Well yeah
1567000	1568000	What's Lindsay Lohan
1568000	1569000	Doing these days
1569000	1570000	I'm saying now
1570000	1571000	That actually they're
1571000	1572000	On my shit list
1572000	1573000	For how they
1573000	1574000	Make money off
1574000	1575000	Of people's grief
1575000	1576000	Well that's
1576000	1577000	That's not a new thing
1577000	1578000	Yeah but they're
1578000	1579000	Absolutely on my
1579000	1580000	Shit list now so
1580000	1581000	I'm not trying to
1581000	1582000	Sound like a jerk
1582000	1583000	But they should have
1583000	1584000	Been on your shit list
1584000	1585000	Years ago for that reason
1585000	1586000	Well they were
1586000	1587000	But I'm calling on
1587000	1588000	Anyone who posts
1588000	1589000	Anything from them
1589000	1590000	Right now
1590000	1591000	But here's the
1591000	1592000	Interesting thing
1592000	1593000	About that
1593000	1594000	Their techniques
1594000	1595000	Are shitty
1595000	1597000	They do find things out
1597000	1598000	First unfortunately
1598000	1599000	Through that method
1599000	1600000	And there is this
1600000	1601000	Inherent human need
1601000	1602000	To want to be
1602000	1603000	First
1603000	1604000	At something
1604000	1605000	Or first
1605000	1606000	I knew about that
1606000	1607000	Firsties first first
1607000	1608000	Those people
1608000	1609000	Need a life
1609000	1610000	That's
1610000	1611000	I'll tie this back
1611000	1612000	To gaming
1612000	1613000	That's why that
1613000	1614000	Thing they did
1614000	1615000	In Pokemon Go
1615000	1616000	This weekend
1616000	1617000	Was so brilliant
1617000	1618000	It was really brilliant
1618000	1619000	And if you don't
1619000	1620000	Try it
1620000	1621000	When community day
1621000	1622000	Finished
1622000	1623000	There was this
1623000	1624000	New Pokemon
1624000	1625000	No one had ever
1625000	1626000	Seen before
1626000	1627000	Unless maybe
1627000	1628000	The nut thing
1628000	1629000	The little nut thing
1629000	1630000	The little nut
1630000	1631000	Ghost thing
1631000	1632000	That showed up
1632000	1633000	In the game
1633000	1634000	And because
1634000	1635000	Nobody had seen it
1635000	1636000	It wasn't teased
1636000	1637000	Every forum
1637000	1638000	Every website
1638000	1639000	Every chat I'm on
1639000	1640000	That's even tangentially
1640000	1641000	About Pokemon Go
1641000	1642000	You've got people
1642000	1643000	That are posting
1643000	1644000	Look what I found
1644000	1645000	Look what I got
1645000	1647000	The gag is
1647000	1648000	That thing was
1648000	1649000	Everywhere
1649000	1650000	Like who didn't see
1650000	1651000	That thing
1651000	1652000	If they had
1652000	1653000	Their game open
1653000	1654000	But people
1654000	1655000	Want to be first
1655000	1656000	And so Pokemon Go
1656000	1657000	Got all this free
1657000	1658000	Shout out on
1658000	1659000	Social media everywhere
1659000	1660000	Because of little
1660000	1661000	Nut monster mon
1661000	1662000	Which is probably
1662000	1663000	The bonus Pokemon
1663000	1664000	That's going to be
1664000	1665000	In Pokemon Let's Go
1665000	1666000	Because they teased
1666000	1667000	That even though
1667000	1668000	It's the 151
1668000	1669000	From Kanto
1669000	1670000	There will be an
1670000	1671000	Additional mon
1671000	1672000	That shows up
1672000	1673000	It's going to be
1673000	1674000	That little dude
1674000	1675000	Yeah but when you
1675000	1676000	Catch it
1676000	1677000	It turns into a ditto
1677000	1678000	That was their
1678000	1679000	Little clever way
1679000	1680000	Of not letting you
1680000	1682000	Really catch it
1682000	1683000	Until
1683000	1684000	Gen 8 is announced
1684000	1685000	Or whatever
1685000	1686000	Dippy little thing
1686000	1687000	They're going to do
1687000	1688000	I think they're just
1688000	1689000	Trolling people
1689000	1690000	I think it's awesome
1690000	1691000	It is
1691000	1692000	It is in a way
1692000	1693000	Let's see
1693000	1694000	SDG100 Matt
1694000	1695000	In chat says
1695000	1696000	That was such a good troll
1696000	1697000	He says
1697000	1698000	It was everywhere
1698000	1699000	Ten fold
1699000	1700000	For the first 30 minutes
1700000	1701000	It's still around now
1701000	1702000	But the first 30 minutes
1702000	1703000	After community day
1703000	1704000	Was over
1704000	1705000	Yeah it was everywhere
1705000	1706000	Well let's talk
1706000	1707000	A little bit about
1707000	1708000	Community day
1708000	1709000	Or whatever
1709000	1710000	You were doing
1710000	1711000	With your gaming week
1711000	1712000	And a little adventure
1712000	1713000	We do called
1713000	1714000	How was your gaming week
1714000	1715000	So Dark Sakura
1715000	1716000	You can really do
1716000	1717000	The whole month if you want
1717000	1718000	But what kind of games
1718000	1719000	You've been playing lately
1719000	1720000	Well it starts
1720000	1721000	With a purchase
1721000	1722000	And I might have brought
1722000	1723000	This up in one of my
1723000	1724000	Radio Magic things
1724000	1726000	But on September 1st
1726000	1728000	Was mine and Dan's anniversary
1728000	1729000	You did talk about
1729000	1730000	The pinball table
1730000	1731000	If this is where we're going
1731000	1732000	Well I'm bringing it up
1732000	1733000	Again because it's
1733000	1734000	Fucking gorgeous
1734000	1735000	I have a theater
1735000	1736000	Finally and it's in
1736000	1737000	Perfect condition
1737000	1738000	Dan was like
1738000	1739000	I don't know what to do
1739000	1740000	With the table
1740000	1741000	I don't have to work on
1741000	1743000	We just play the shit out of it
1743000	1744000	And it's great
1744000	1745000	It's beautiful
1745000	1746000	So we have theater of magic
1746000	1747000	We've also gotten
1747000	1748000	The Shadow
1748000	1749000	And
1749000	1751000	Last Action Hero
1751000	1752000	Which actually more has
1752000	1754000	Sentimental value for us
1754000	1755000	And
1755000	1756000	I don't know some other one
1756000	1757000	That I don't remember
1757000	1758000	What we got
1758000	1759000	But whatever
1759000	1762000	Then
1762000	1763000	I've been playing
1764000	1766000	A lot of Pokemon Go
1766000	1767000	I've played some Ingress
1767000	1769000	Just not a whole lot
1769000	1770000	I'm back to playing
1770000	1771000	Bejeweled for some reason
1771000	1773000	Which is actually
1773000	1775000	Kind of crazily addictive
1775000	1776000	And I'm still playing
1776000	1778000	Idolpouring
1778000	1781000	But
1781000	1782000	That's really about it
1782000	1784000	I've been very busy
1784000	1785000	Work is weird
1785000	1786000	And then all my volunteer
1786000	1788000	Stuff is taking up my time
1788000	1791000	Oh no I did play something else
1794000	1795000	Oh yeah
1795000	1796000	We have the Nintendo out
1796000	1797000	So I did actually play
1797000	1800000	The Guardian Legend
1800000	1803000	Without it slowing me down
1803000	1804000	I love The Guardian Legend
1804000	1805000	That's just
1805000	1806000	Let's just take a moment
1806000	1808000	Gaming perfection
1808000	1810000	No Rob needs a moment of silence
1810000	1811000	I do
1811000	1812000	For reasons
1814000	1815000	Other than that
1815000	1816000	I've just been looking at stuff
1816000	1817000	And going
1817000	1818000	Oh that'd be cute
1818000	1819000	Oh that'd be cute
1819000	1821000	Like gaming accessories
1821000	1822000	Like
1822000	1823000	Girlie shit
1823000	1824000	Like my Triforce necklace
1824000	1825000	That I wore last night
1825000	1826000	And I was like
1826000	1827000	Oh you're wearing a Triforce
1827000	1828000	And I was like
1828000	1829000	Yeah it's a Triforce necklace
1829000	1830000	It's cool
1830000	1831000	You know just
1831000	1832000	Little stuff and
1832000	1835000	Oh and Dan and I
1835000	1836000	Watched a playthrough
1836000	1839000	That was done like
1839000	1840000	We weren't actually playing it
1840000	1841000	But it was funny
1841000	1842000	Because we were watching
1842000	1843000	A playthrough of like
1843000	1845000	Transformers Devastation
1845000	1848000	And it was done like a movie
1848000	1849000	With the soundtrack for
1849000	1850000	Transformers the movie in it
1850000	1851000	As in the real movie
1851000	1852000	Not these live action
1852000	1853000	Pieces of shit
1853000	1854000	Which by the way
1854000	1855000	I'm gonna see
1855000	1856000	Transformers the movie
1856000	1857000	On the 27th
1857000	1858000	In the theater
1858000	1859000	Bam
1859000	1860000	I know you're seeing it
1860000	1861000	The week before
1861000	1862000	I'm seeing Gaga in
1862000	1863000	A Star is Born
1863000	1864000	Because that came up
1864000	1865000	On Facebook this week
1865000	1866000	I'm going to see
1866000	1867000	The better movie
1867000	1868000	No you're not
1868000	1870000	Years won't win an Oscar
1870000	1871000	We've had people who
1871000	1872000	Were in that movie
1872000	1873000	On this show
1873000	1874000	No I know
1874000	1875000	I know
1875000	1876000	I'm not hating on
1876000	1877000	The Transformers thing
1877000	1878000	I've also still decided
1878000	1879000	That if anyone was gonna
1879000	1880000	Narrate my life
1880000	1881000	Maybe Morgan Freeman
1881000	1882000	Or Sammy L
1882000	1883000	Wanda Sykes for me
1883000	1884000	It'd be Greg Berger
1884000	1885000	As Grimlock
1885000	1886000	I'm sure he's very
1886000	1887000	Happy to hear that
1887000	1889000	Well he seemed to be
1890000	1891000	Alright
1891000	1892000	So no other games
1892000	1893000	To share for now
1893000	1894000	Alright let's move over to
1894000	1895000	I'm sorry she didn't
1895000	1896000	Talk about World of Warcraft
1896000	1897000	Because I was gonna
1897000	1898000	Talk about World of
1898000	1899000	Oh yeah I did play
1899000	1900000	World of Warcraft
1900000	1901000	Shit
1901000	1902000	This bitch right here
1902000	1903000	Yeah no because
1903000	1904000	I've been kind of playing
1904000	1905000	Eradically
1905000	1906000	Because she keeps yelling
1906000	1907000	At me that I'm not
1907000	1908000	Playing my Alliance
1908000	1909000	Character
1909000	1910000	If you hop on Alliance
1910000	1911000	And then do the
1911000	1912000	Argus stuff with me
1912000	1913000	So I can actually go through
1913000	1914000	Some of those dungeons
1914000	1915000	I haven't done yet
1917000	1918000	You need to bring back
1918000	1919000	Sassy Pants
1920000	1921000	She's still there
1921000	1922000	I didn't kill her
1922000	1923000	You can remake her
1923000	1924000	As a dark iron
1924000	1925000	Alright
1926000	1927000	Speaking of Pokemon Go
1927000	1928000	So this is like some
1928000	1929000	Late breaking news
1929000	1930000	Do do do do
1930000	1932000	So a friend of mine
1933000	1934000	Is said he needs
1934000	1935000	Three new friends

1937000	1938000	And so I'm like
1938000	1939000	But the thing is
1939000	1940000	All these people are

1952000	1953000	Actually help you here
1953000	1954000	Do you want me to give out
1954000	1955000	Your code on the radio show

1956000	1957000	Strangers add you
1957000	1958000	And he said yes
1958000	1959000	So I would love it
1959000	1960000	If you would all add
1960000	1961000	My pal Curtis
1961000	1962000	As your friend in Pokemon Go
1962000	1963000	His code is
1963000	1964000	So get out your phones
1964000	1965000	Everybody
1965000	1967000	2 8 1 4
1967000	1969000	6 3 0 8
1969000	1971000	2 3 4 1
1971000	1972000	He said I could do it
1972000	1973000	So
1973000	1974000	I can't add him yet
1974000	1975000	Because I also
1975000	1976000	Need to add friends
1976000	1977000	For that quest too
1977000	1978000	At some point
1978000	1979000	Well then you both
1979000	1980000	Would get it
1980000	1981000	But yeah
1981000	1982000	But I have to wait
1982000	1983000	Until I actually have to
1983000	1984000	Do that so you know
1984000	1985000	Okay
1985000	1986000	This is completely real
1986000	1987000	As you know
1987000	1988000	This is completely real
1988000	1989000	Add him
1989000	1990000	Add him as your friend
1990000	1991000	This is my pal Curtis
1991000	1992000	I'll be there before
1992000	1993000	Too long so
1993000	1994000	My code will go out
1994000	1995000	I did the reality game
1995000	1996000	On Facebook
1996000	1997000	He was in it too
1997000	1998000	And he did a YouTube
1998000	1999000	He's on a YouTube show
1999000	2000000	That's a reality show
2000000	2002000	Called sequester
2002000	2003000	So
2003000	2004000	If you watch that
2004000	2005000	Type of garbage
2005000	2006000	You might have seen
2006000	2007000	This whole adding
2007000	2008000	Three friends thing
2008000	2010000	Makes me feel a lot like
2010000	2011000	The whole ingress thing
2011000	2012000	Where they want you to
2012000	2013000	Recruit people
2013000	2014000	And it's like
2014000	2015000	I can't recruit people
2015000	2016000	Because no one wants
2016000	2017000	To play this
2017000	2018000	Ingress
2018000	2019000	Ingress
2019000	2020000	That badge doesn't do shit
2020000	2021000	It's like a vanity thing
2021000	2022000	Whereas in Pokemon
2022000	2023000	Like if you want to have Mew
2023000	2024000	The problem is
2024000	2025000	He really wants to have Mew
2025000	2026000	You
2026000	2027000	You have to actually
2027000	2028000	Add people
2028000	2029000	On Pokemon Go
2029000	2030000	So you have to add people
2030000	2031000	But I already added people
2031000	2033000	Why do I have to add more people?
2033000	2036000	I am actually in a Sacramento area
2036000	2038000	Pokemon Go player group
2038000	2039000	That all you have to do
2039000	2040000	Is post in there
2040000	2041000	And people will add you
2041000	2042000	If you want
2042000	2043000	Yeah
2043000	2044000	All right
2044000	2045000	Well we got
2045000	2046000	I see act deaf says
2046000	2047000	I'll add him
2047000	2048000	And so there's some people
2048000	2049000	Saying they're gonna add
2049000	2050000	So I appreciate that
2050000	2051000	Do that
2051000	2052000	Add him
2052000	2053000	All right
2053000	2055000	Loki
2055000	2058000	I played Pokemon Go a little bit
2058000	2059000	And
2059000	2061000	I don't know
2061000	2062000	What else
2062000	2064000	I loaded up an emulator
2064000	2065000	On my computer
2065000	2066000	To play
2066000	2067000	Ridge Racer R4
2067000	2068000	Because I saw the announcement
2068000	2069000	That came out
2069000	2070000	I was like
2070000	2071000	Oh yeah I like that game
2071000	2072000	Let me try playing that again
2072000	2075000	I did not age well
2075000	2076000	I don't know
2076000	2077000	It's all right
2077000	2079000	I like Ridge Racer R4
2079000	2080000	I mean it's one of the best
2080000	2081000	Ridge Racer games
2081000	2083000	But it does not look good
2083000	2084000	On that emulator
2084000	2086000	It just
2086000	2087000	I don't know
2087000	2088000	What magic they're gonna be able
2088000	2089000	To do on the TV
2089000	2090000	To make it look fantastic
2090000	2091000	Like I remember it
2091000	2093000	But that was not it
2093000	2094000	But it's still fun
2094000	2096000	And then
2096000	2098000	What else did I play
2098000	2101000	I tried a little bit
2101000	2103000	I was gonna download
2103000	2105000	The Forza Horizon 4 demo
2105000	2106000	But I'm like
2106000	2107000	Do I really need to download
2107000	2108000	A demo
2108000	2109000	I'll just buy the game
2109000	2110000	When it comes out
2110000	2111000	When you know
2111000	2112000	You're already gonna buy the game
2112000	2113000	Yeah it's like
2113000	2114000	I'll just buy the game
2114000	2115000	When it comes out
2115000	2116000	For what it's worth
2116000	2117000	It gives you a little bit
2117000	2118000	Of a jump start
2118000	2119000	On the game
2119000	2120000	And there's like
2120000	2121000	A clothing item
2121000	2122000	You unlock
2122000	2123000	Whoopty shit
2123000	2124000	But you get a little shirt
2124000	2125000	For doing the first part
2125000	2126000	Of the demo
2126000	2127000	A shirt for a driver
2127000	2128000	That's in a car
2128000	2129000	That I never see
2129000	2130000	Well actually no
2130000	2131000	You see the driver
2131000	2132000	Because they change
2132000	2134000	The little recaps
2134000	2135000	So you see the little driver
2135000	2136000	Standing next to the car
2136000	2137000	Going fuck yeah
2137000	2138000	I won
2138000	2139000	So you do see the drivers
2139000	2141000	In like the recap screens
2141000	2142000	Oh yeah
2142000	2143000	Well
2143000	2144000	It's very much a vanity thing though
2144000	2147000	It's very very much a vanity thing
2147000	2148000	You can't run over the sheep
2148000	2150000	The sheep will always avoid the car
2150000	2151000	That sounds like a challenge
2151000	2152000	Uh yeah
2152000	2153000	That was posted in our Discord
2153000	2154000	There was a little video
2154000	2155000	Where the sheep are programmed
2155000	2156000	So that they consistently
2156000	2159000	Run away from the car
2159000	2160000	So
2160000	2161000	Get enough cars
2161000	2162000	Lined up
2162000	2165000	Anything's possible
2165000	2167000	Loki wants to kill the sheep
2167000	2168000	It's just because they tell me
2168000	2169000	I can't kill the sheep
2169000	2171000	I mean come on
2171000	2174000	We're the classic days of
2174000	2175000	You know cruising
2175000	2176000	USA and stuff like that
2176000	2177000	Carmageddon
2177000	2178000	We're eating like
2178000	2179000	Smashing the deer
2179000	2180000	And it just
2180000	2181000	Gives everywhere
2181000	2182000	Gross
2182000	2185000	Alright anything else for your gaming week?
2185000	2186000	Um
2186000	2188000	No I think that was it
2188000	2190000	Okay my gaming week
2190000	2191000	Let me start with some of the stuff
2191000	2192000	That's been discussed already
2192000	2193000	So World of Warcraft
2193000	2194000	I am continuing my adventures
2194000	2195000	In World of Warcraft
2195000	2196000	So unlike Jamie
2196000	2197000	I've been playing Horde
2197000	2198000	Simply because my druid
2198000	2199000	Is on Horde
2199000	2200000	And I really wanted to play my druid
2200000	2201000	Um
2201000	2202000	And
2202000	2203000	Yeah
2203000	2204000	Although I was really kind of bored
2204000	2205000	Because my guild had like
2205000	2206000	Nobody playing in it
2206000	2207000	So I moved to a different guild
2207000	2209000	I'm in a guild with Dr. Ken
2209000	2210000	From Starboard Power Coupling
2210000	2212000	And so there's a few more chatty people there
2212000	2213000	So it's nice
2213000	2214000	It's nice to like
2214000	2215000	Not be playing an MMO by myself
2215000	2216000	Um
2216000	2218000	I think that helps World of Warcraft
2218000	2219000	Be a little better
2219000	2220000	And yeah I'm kind of into it
2220000	2221000	Like I'm
2221000	2222000	I'm into this expansion
2222000	2223000	I don't know how long I will be
2223000	2224000	Because I tend to like
2224000	2226000	Go through the leveling up thing
2226000	2227000	And then once I hit max level
2227000	2228000	I'm like
2228000	2229000	Eh fuck rating
2229000	2230000	And I kind of fizzle out
2230000	2231000	But we'll see
2231000	2232000	We'll see how long this keeps my interest
2232000	2233000	I like that they have
2233000	2234000	You know
2234000	2235000	It seems like there's more of a variety
2235000	2236000	Of things to do
2236000	2237000	As you level up
2237000	2238000	I like that they have like
2238000	2239000	This whole island expedition thing
2239000	2240000	It's kind of neat
2240000	2241000	I just did one of those today
2241000	2242000	And so it was like
2242000	2243000	Kind of like a
2243000	2244000	PvP
2244000	2245000	But it wasn't actually other players
2245000	2246000	It was computer controlled
2246000	2247000	AI
2247000	2248000	And it was like
2248000	2250000	You have to mine as much Azerite
2250000	2251000	As you can on the island
2251000	2252000	Faster than the other team
2252000	2253000	Um
2253000	2254000	And I thought it was kind of a neat
2254000	2255000	Little like minigame
2255000	2256000	So yeah
2256000	2257000	That was cool
2257000	2258000	Um
2258000	2259000	I played that
2259000	2260000	And uh
2260000	2261000	Yeah
2261000	2262000	It's kind of what I've been doing
2262000	2263000	In World of Warcraft
2263000	2264000	I also started Diablo 3
2264000	2265000	Again
2265000	2267000	Because season 15 just started on Friday
2267000	2268000	So
2268000	2269000	Gotta start another new character
2269000	2270000	And get all the cosmetic rewards
2270000	2271000	From getting to level 70
2271000	2272000	And all that stuff
2272000	2273000	So
2273000	2274000	I started doing that
2274000	2275000	Uh
2275000	2276000	Playing Diablo 3
2276000	2277000	Uh
2277000	2278000	Pokemon Go
2278000	2279000	Community day
2279000	2280000	Was this past weekend
2280000	2281000	Had a lot of fun
2281000	2282000	Just walking around the capital
2282000	2283000	I feel like with Chikorita
2283000	2284000	Man
2284000	2285000	Those were crazy
2285000	2286000	Like
2286000	2287000	I'm just talking like
2287000	2288000	The number of Chikorita
2288000	2289000	That were around
2289000	2290000	Like were more than any other
2290000	2291000	Community day
2291000	2292000	Yeah
2292000	2293000	And the shinies too
2293000	2294000	Because I got like three or four shinies
2294000	2296080	And I was able to evolve like two whole
2296080	2297600	Chikorita sets
2297600	2298600	And
2298600	2300960	Everybody in my group got five or six shinies
2300960	2302160	And we also
2302160	2303560	And we never do this
2303560	2305160	We took time out of Community day
2305160	2306160	To raid
2306160	2307440	So we went and re-rated
2307440	2308440	Over at um
2308440	2310800	The theater at the convention center
2310800	2312000	Had a Mewtwo that popped
2312000	2313400	You have to see my picture on Twitter
2313400	2315560	There were like 300 people
2315560	2317480	Swarming around this building
2317480	2318480	Where there was a Mewtwo
2318480	2319480	And just you know
2319480	2320480	Obviously you would go in
2320480	2321480	And the lobby would be full
2321480	2322480	Although we did
2322480	2323480	We ended up doing a private group
2323480	2324480	So that we could just
2324480	2325480	All increase our friendship levels
2325480	2326480	And all that
2326480	2327480	Um
2327480	2328480	So
2328480	2329480	And we took out Mewtwo there
2329480	2330480	And then we went to the church
2330480	2331480	You know at the capital park
2331480	2332480	Here in SAC
2332480	2333480	You know there's that church
2333480	2334480	That's right across the street
2334480	2335480	That's a gym as well
2335480	2336680	So Mewtwo popped there too
2336680	2337960	And so you had all these people
2337960	2338960	Lining the street
2338960	2339960	On one side
2339960	2340960	And all these people lining the street
2340960	2341960	On the other
2341960	2342960	Doing the same thing
2342960	2343960	And there was a Mewtwo that was there
2343960	2344960	So it was just
2344960	2345960	It was crazy
2345960	2346960	But it was cool
2346960	2347960	Um
2347960	2348960	But yeah it was
2348960	2349960	It was interesting
2349960	2350960	By 1.30
2350960	2351960	Which um
2351960	2352960	You know Pacific time
2352960	2353960	Community day goes
2353960	2354960	11 am to 2 pm
2354960	2355960	So by 1.30
2355960	2356960	We were like
2356960	2357960	It's getting hot
2357960	2358960	Supposed to be like 94 today
2358960	2359960	Um
2359960	2360960	Are we kind of done?
2360960	2361960	And everyone was like
2361960	2362960	Yeah we're done
2362960	2363960	We've got like five
2363960	2364960	Six shinies
2364960	2365960	We're good
2365960	2366960	So we called it a day
2366960	2367960	Like 30 minutes early
2367960	2368960	Which we never do
2368960	2369960	Yeah
2369960	2370960	Because like
2370960	2371960	With EV community day
2371960	2372960	There's like 10 shinies
2372960	2373960	Into each of the set
2373960	2374960	You know
2374960	2375960	Of EVs
2375960	2376960	So you could have like
2376960	2377960	A ton of different shiny EVs
2377960	2378960	Basically
2378960	2379960	But
2379960	2380960	I don't know
2380960	2381960	Chikorita is like
2381960	2382960	Eh
2382960	2383960	Eh
2383960	2384960	I don't really want this
2384960	2385960	Yeah
2385960	2386960	Well no
2386960	2387960	Chikorita is cool
2387960	2388960	It's actually
2388960	2389960	Ironically it's pumpkin spice
2389960	2390960	Chikorita
2390960	2391960	Is what it looks like to me
2391960	2392960	So
2392960	2393960	An appropriate fall flavor
2393960	2394960	I got a shiny Charmander
2394960	2395960	The other day
2395960	2396960	Oh just randomly?
2396960	2397960	Just randomly
2397960	2398960	Yeah it's nice that once you have
2398960	2399960	Like the community day
2399960	2400960	Then the shinies are kind of like
2400960	2401960	Good
2401960	2402960	They're just like
2402960	2403960	Less of a spawn
2403960	2404960	But you'll find them
2404960	2405960	Like the
2405960	2406960	Well they didn't get a community day
2406960	2407960	But those swabloos
2407960	2408960	Like I've
2408960	2409960	I just randomly have picked up
2409960	2410960	Two of them
2410960	2411960	Just catching like
2411960	2412960	Regular Pokemon
2412960	2413960	It's kind of
2413960	2414960	Kind of cool
2414960	2415960	Other games that I've played
2415960	2416960	Doesn't stop there
2416960	2417960	So I've also been playing
2417960	2418960	Forza Horizon 4
2418960	2419960	I downloaded the demo for that
2419960	2420960	So the
2420960	2421960	I did download the demo
2421960	2422960	Because I wanted to get in there
2422960	2423960	And
2423960	2424960	So it starts with
2424960	2425960	You rate
2425960	2426960	It's very much like
2426960	2427960	Shoving down your throat
2427960	2428960	Did you know that this game
2428960	2429960	Has seasons?
2429960	2430960	And so it's like
2430960	2432960	Race through the autumn season
2432960	2434960	Now race through the winter season
2434960	2435960	Now it's the summer
2435960	2436960	So you go
2436960	2437960	Does it change as you go
2437960	2438960	Throughout the year
2438960	2439960	Or is it just
2439960	2440960	Not in this demo
2440960	2441960	In the demo
2441960	2442960	I know the demo doesn't
2442960	2444960	The demo just kind of like
2444960	2445960	Like because it was four
2445960	2446960	Different type of races
2446960	2447960	Like it started with like
2447960	2449960	A very generic type of race
2449960	2450960	In the autumn
2450960	2451960	And then the winner was like
2451960	2452960	You were in this big dune buggy
2452960	2453960	Going through the snow
2453960	2454960	And you did like this big ramp
2454960	2455960	And then summer
2455960	2456960	I remember you're racing
2456960	2457960	Motorcycles
2457960	2458960	And the motorcycles all had
2459960	2460960	And it was a really cool effect
2460960	2461960	Like one thing I just love
2461960	2462960	About Forza
2462960	2464960	Is that it's extra as fuck
2464960	2466960	Like it's so extra
2466960	2467960	Like you'll be driving down
2467960	2468960	Like confetti cannons
2468960	2469960	Going off everywhere
2469960	2470960	And like the sheep
2470960	2471960	Chasing the sheep
2471960	2472960	I consider as like
2472960	2473960	An extra thing too
2473960	2474960	And it's just like
2474960	2475960	Extra extra extra
2475960	2476960	And since you know what
2476960	2478960	Since this week Mario Kart
2478960	2480960	Got ruined for a lot of us
2480960	2481960	I'll just leave it at that
2481960	2482960	Mario Kart
2482960	2483960	And one particular character
2483960	2484960	In Mario Kart
2484960	2486960	Got ruined for a lot of people
2486960	2487960	So people are gonna be funny
2487960	2488960	A break maybe
2488960	2489960	I think Forza
2489960	2490960	You know it's a very different
2490960	2491960	type of game
2491960	2492960	But I just love how
2492960	2493960	Over the top it is
2493960	2494960	It's why I prefer
2494960	2495960	The Horizon series
2495960	2497960	Way much more than the mainline
2497960	2498960	Forza Motorsport games
2498960	2499960	It's just
2499960	2500960	It's arcadey
2500960	2501960	And it's so extra
2501960	2502960	Like flying
2502960	2504960	So you do the season thing
2504960	2505960	And I honestly thought
2505960	2506960	That was gonna be it
2506960	2507960	I was like
2507960	2508960	Oh is that
2508960	2509960	I downloaded 25 gigs for that
2509960	2510960	That's gonna be it
2510960	2511960	But then no
2511960	2512960	The game starts up
2512960	2513960	It's like
2513960	2514960	So what do you want
2514960	2515960	Your name to be
2515960	2516960	And what's awesome
2516960	2517960	Like they've recorded
2517960	2518960	Like 500 names
2518960	2519960	So you can like
2519960	2520960	Have the announcer
2520960	2521960	Call you my name right
2521960	2522960	But one of the nicknames
2522960	2523960	You can be
2523960	2524960	Roberts
2524960	2526960	So they call me Roberts
2526960	2527960	So
2527960	2528960	Which is kind of funny
2528960	2530960	So I play the game as that
2530960	2531960	And it lets you start the game
2531960	2532960	So you do this race
2532960	2533960	You do another race
2533960	2535960	And then you do like a stunt
2535960	2536960	They're like
2536960	2537960	We want you to be a stunt double
2537960	2538960	In this new movie
2538960	2539960	And you do a stunt race
2539960	2540960	Where you go like
2540960	2541960	Flying through a windmill
2541960	2542960	And you fly off the cliff
2542960	2543960	Into a field
2543960	2544960	And it looks
2544960	2545960	Like I was playing
2545960	2546960	My PC
2546960	2547960	And my PC can only run
2547960	2548960	On like medium settings
2548960	2549960	Because you know
2549960	2550960	Even though my computer
2550960	2551960	Is like two years old
2551960	2552960	At this point
2552960	2553960	It was top of the line
2553960	2554960	When I got it
2554960	2555960	Well it's only two years old
2555960	2556960	Now you know
2556960	2557960	It's like
2557960	2558960	Might as well bought it
2558960	2559960	A decade ago
2559960	2560960	Um
2560960	2561960	But it looked beautiful
2561960	2562960	Even in the medium mode
2562960	2563960	So um
2563960	2564960	Yeah I was
2564960	2565960	Enjoying Forza
2565960	2566960	So cool
2566960	2567960	Cool
2567960	2568960	Um
2568960	2569960	I think that's probably it
2569960	2570960	Finally for my gaming week
2570960	2571960	I think that's most of the stuff
2571960	2572960	I've been playing this week
2572960	2573960	Bobby says the seasons
2573960	2574960	Change every week
2574960	2575960	Like real week
2575960	2576960	Yeah
2576960	2577960	Or
2577960	2578960	Because
2578960	2579960	I know it keeps telling me
2579960	2580960	It says um
2580960	2581960	Um
2581960	2583960	Progress towards autumn
2583960	2585960	And then autumn unlocked
2585960	2586960	But I haven't unlocked it yet
2586960	2587960	Because I had to stop the demo
2587960	2588960	Because I was just doing it today
2588960	2589960	So I had to stop the demo
2589960	2590960	To prep for OLR
2590960	2591960	I did the stunt race thing
2591960	2592960	And that's where I stopped the demo
2592960	2594960	But I saw a hella
2594960	2595960	Like other people
2595960	2596960	On my Xbox friends list
2596960	2597960	Like every race I did
2597960	2598960	Was completely full
2598960	2599960	With gamer tags
2599960	2601960	From my Xbox
2601960	2602960	Like I raced against
2602960	2603960	Black Wolf
2604960	2605960	I mean I know it's not really them
2605960	2606960	Because I whooped them all
2606960	2607960	And that would not have happened
2607960	2609960	If they had been the real drivers
2609960	2611960	But it's still kind of fun to see
2611960	2612960	You know
2612960	2613960	Stuff based off your friends
2613960	2614960	Or whatever so
2614960	2615960	That's pretty cool
2615960	2616960	Um
2616960	2617960	Bobby Black Wolf says
2617960	2618960	Yes every real week
2618960	2619960	The season changes
2619960	2620960	Interesting
2620960	2621960	Bobby also points out
2621960	2622960	That's just the Drivatar system
2622960	2623960	Yeah
2623960	2624960	Well the nice thing is
2624960	2625960	You'll all see my license plate
2625960	2626960	So my license plate was
2626960	2627960	Hi
2627960	2629960	That's my license plate
2629960	2630960	H-I-E
2630960	2631960	Hi
2631960	2632960	So enjoy that
2632960	2633960	Alright
2633960	2634960	S2100 Matt says
2634960	2635960	I need this game to come out already
2635960	2636960	I also wish I had an Xbox One X
2636960	2638960	And a 4K TV to fully enjoy it
2638960	2639960	Uh
2639960	2640960	What early access
2640960	2641960	On September 28th
2641960	2642960	I don't believe in the early
2642960	2643960	Like they want you to buy
2643960	2644960	The Ultra
2644960	2645960	Edition
2645960	2646960	You know
2646960	2647960	The like hundred dollar
2647960	2648960	Forza
2648960	2649960	Comes with early
2649960	2650960	You don't need the game that quick
2650960	2651960	Like give it a
2651960	2652960	I think it comes out
2652960	2653960	Like a week later
2653960	2654960	For everybody else
2654960	2655960	So
2655960	2656960	Oh
2656960	2657960	Yeah
2657960	2658960	Maybe you do need the game that quick
2658960	2659960	I don't know
2659960	2660960	It's your money
2660960	2661960	Spend it how you want
2661960	2662960	It's only on the second
2662960	2663960	I think
2663960	2664960	Yeah
2664960	2665960	You don't have to wait that long for it
2665960	2666960	It's coming out soon
2666960	2667960	Alright so that was my gaming week
2667960	2668960	Let's move on
2668960	2669960	Announcements
2669960	2670960	I don't really have a lot of
2670960	2671960	A ton of things to say
2671960	2672960	Um
2672960	2673960	Since we had the unexpected week off
2673960	2674960	Earlier in the month
2674960	2675960	We don't really have anything planned
2675960	2676960	Until probably
2676960	2677960	Um
2677960	2678960	I don't even know if we'll be off the week
2678960	2679960	Thanks
2679960	2680960	Probably not until the holidays
2680960	2681960	We'll be looking at any shows off
2681960	2682960	At least planned ones
2682960	2683960	Knock on wood
2683960	2685960	Hopefully nothing unexpected happens

2694960	2695960	And some other things that are happening
2695960	2696960	In the gaming world
2696960	2697960	Loki we'll start with you
2697960	2698960	Yes
2698960	2701960	It's the PlayStation Classic
2701960	2702960	You might think
2702960	2703960	Hey wait a second
2703960	2705960	Isn't Nintendo the one that releases
2705960	2707960	These consoles that are smaller
2707960	2708960	That are a hundred bucks
2708960	2709960	That have games in them
2709960	2710960	But no
2710960	2711960	Sony wants to jump in on that
2711960	2714960	Like they did on motion control
2714960	2716960	And they want a piece of that action
2716960	2717960	So
2717960	2718960	Coming out December 3rd
2718960	2719960	In US Canada

2721960	2722960	You're gonna get
2722960	2724960	A PlayStation Classic for
2724960	2725960	99.99
2725960	2727960	Or you know
2727960	2729960	The equivalent in your territory
2729960	2732960	And they will include 20 games
2732960	2735960	As well as two controllers
2735960	2739960	It won't include an AC adapter though
2739960	2741960	But it will be bundled with USB cable
2741960	2743960	That you can power it by
2743960	2744960	I think that's dumb
2744960	2747960	But whatever
2747960	2748960	Games that they've announced so far
2748960	2749960	They're gonna be in there

2752960	2753960	Type 4
2753960	2754960	Tekken 3
2754960	2755960	And Wild Arms
2755960	2758960	It's not a bad lineup so far
2758960	2761960	I'd be interested to see
2761960	2762960	How we can hack this thing
2762960	2764960	Cause you know it's gonna happen day one
2764960	2766960	It always does
2766960	2768960	I would even be more surprised
2768960	2770960	If it isn't running the same hardware
2770960	2772960	As the SNES Classic and stuff
2772960	2774960	Cause I think those you can actually run
2774960	2776960	PlayStation Emulators in as well
2777960	2778960	But yeah
2778960	2780960	This thing will be running Nintendo games
2780960	2781960	In no time
2781960	2782960	You know
2782960	2783960	Okay speaking of all that
2783960	2784960	Something I completely forgot
2784960	2785960	And left out of my gaming week
2785960	2788960	Was that I did play those NES Classics
2788960	2789960	On Tuesday night
2789960	2790960	Oh yeah
2790960	2791960	I got the whole online thing
2791960	2792960	And I purchased that
2792960	2793960	And I looked at that
2793960	2794960	I'm like
2794960	2795960	No I played
2795960	2796960	Bobby was streaming
2796960	2797960	So I'm still having the cable issues at home
2797960	2798960	So I can't stream to Twitch
2798960	2799960	I mean I can do the radio show
2799960	2800960	Cause it's low bandwidth
2800960	2802960	But I can't do Twitch
2802960	2803960	But I was like
2803960	2804960	Well if I can't do my own stream
2804960	2805960	I'll crash someone else's
2805960	2806960	So I went on to Bobby
2806960	2807960	You didn't fix your cable
2807960	2808960	When they came out here
2808960	2810960	Okay so long story short
2810960	2811960	The guy that was here
2811960	2813960	Like he definitely tried
2813960	2814960	And he was definitely like
2814960	2815960	Okay I do see a problem
2815960	2816960	And he showed me
2816960	2817960	And he listened to what I was saying
2817960	2818960	And he like
2818960	2819960	Okay yeah I get it
2819960	2820960	I see what your problem is
2820960	2821960	Cool
2821960	2822960	And he actually went up the pole
2822960	2823960	And looked and he's like
2823960	2824960	Look at what I'm seeing
2824960	2825960	He showed me
2825960	2826960	He's like
2826960	2827960	See all this noise here
2827960	2828960	This is a problem
2828960	2829960	I want to see which outlet
2829960	2830960	Is coming from
2830960	2831960	He looked at the outlets
2831960	2832960	He said
2832960	2833960	Okay your living room outlet
2833960	2834960	Is a problem
2834960	2835960	And he said
2835960	2836960	Okay so see
2836960	2837960	Now all the noise is gone
2837960	2838960	So give it 24 hours
2838960	2839960	And see where it's gonna be at from here
2839960	2840960	So I was like
2840960	2841960	Okay
2841960	2842960	At least this guy listened to me
2842960	2843960	He showed me something tangible
2843960	2844960	He was working on
2844960	2845960	I'm like totally like
2845960	2846960	Happy
2846960	2847960	But the problem is
2847960	2848960	He didn't fix it
2848960	2849960	I mean
2849960	2850960	He tried
2850960	2851960	You tried
2851960	2852960	But unfortunately he didn't fix the issue
2852960	2853960	So I gotta
2853960	2854960	In all fairness
2854960	2856960	Comcast was supposed to follow up with me
2856960	2857960	They haven't
2857960	2859960	So I'll have to run that up the flagpole again
2859960	2860960	I've just been kinda
2860960	2862960	On other things this week
2862960	2863960	Where I'm just kinda getting used to this life
2863960	2864960	Where it's like
2864960	2865960	I guess I'm not gonna be able to stream to Twitch
2865960	2867960	Although that's gonna be a problem
2867960	2869960	When this show wants to move to Twitch
2869960	2870960	But uh
2870960	2871960	We'll just have to cross that bridge
2871960	2872960	And we get to it
2872960	2874960	We may have to move the place we do this show
2874960	2875960	We'll see
2875960	2877960	Well I hear that Verizon's got
2877960	2879960	Their 5G or whatever that they're offering now
2879960	2880960	With their service
2880960	2881960	For 50 bucks a month
2881960	2882960	Gigabit down
2882960	2883960	And apparently
2883960	2884960	Um
2884960	2886960	It's in Sacramento
2886960	2887960	Sure
2887960	2888960	Not where I live
2888960	2889960	Yeah
2889960	2891960	Slightly outside of Sacramento
2891960	2892960	But in Sacramento proper
2892960	2893960	They get all the fucking nice shit
2893960	2895960	Does that count Sacramento County
2895960	2896960	Because I'm not in Sacramento proper
2896960	2897960	I'm in Sacramento County
2897960	2898960	Yeah
2898960	2899960	Yeah
2899960	2900960	Exactly
2900960	2901960	So anyway
2901960	2902960	But you're closer
2902960	2903960	Than I am so
2903960	2904960	So anyway
2904960	2905960	No resolution to that yet
2905960	2907960	So I was crashing Bobby's stream
2907960	2908960	And we were playing
2908960	2910960	Now we tried to play the online multiplayer
2910960	2912960	It did lag a little bit
2912960	2914960	Like I could feel
2914960	2915960	A little sluggishness
2915960	2916960	Like playing
2916960	2917960	Muddy waters type of thing
2917960	2918960	Like when I was playing
2918960	2919960	Super Mario Brothers
2919960	2920960	Like this doesn't
2920960	2921960	This doesn't snap
2921960	2922960	The way it should
2922960	2923960	When I play it usually
2923960	2924960	Like it wasn't horrific
2924960	2926960	But it was definitely noticeable
2926960	2928960	But what we did
2928960	2929960	And we don't know what that could
2929960	2931960	Could that be my cable problems at home
2931960	2932960	Could that be the fact
2932960	2933960	He's streaming
2933960	2934960	And doing the NES
2934960	2935960	Who knows
2935960	2937960	So we put it into low latency mode
2937960	2938960	And it was fine
2938960	2940960	So if you have problems playing
2940960	2941960	Online with your friends
2941960	2943960	Go look for that low latency mode
2943960	2944960	And turn it on
2944960	2945960	Because I don't know why
2945960	2948960	Low latency isn't on by default
2948960	2950960	But for whatever reason it's not
2950960	2952960	Why is there even a mode to turn that on
2952960	2954960	If that makes it run good
2954960	2955960	I don't understand
2955960	2956960	Like what
2956960	2957960	I'm not sure
2957960	2958960	Maybe somebody in chat knows
2958960	2959960	Maybe Bobby or something
2959960	2960960	What are you sacrificing
2960960	2961960	To get low latency
2961960	2962960	Because that's where my mind is
2962960	2964960	Like why would that not be the norm
2964960	2966960	Is it that I can't stream the whole game
2966960	2968960	I mean literally the game downloads
2968960	2969960	Faster than a
2969960	2970960	You know
2970960	2971960	Than a web page
2971960	2972960	I don't understand what
2972960	2974960	What you would be
2974960	2975960	Sacrificing in low latency
2975960	2977960	Yeah I didn't understand that either
2977960	2978960	But anyway
2979960	2981960	To register participation
2981960	2982960	For this week's episode
2982960	2983960	Of Orange Lounge Radio
2983960	2984960	At vognetwork.com
2984960	2985960	Use the passphrase
2985960	2986960	COAST
2986960	2988960	It worked fine in low latency mode
2988960	2989960	And we had a good time
2989960	2990960	It's just that
2990960	2991960	There's not a lot of like
2991960	2992960	Riveting two player games
2992960	2993960	We played Dr. Mario
2993960	2994960	We tried to play Double Dragon
2994960	2995960	And then realized
2995960	2996960	Oh yeah
2996960	2997960	NES Double Dragon
2997960	2999960	They had that shitty little versus mode
2999960	3000960	For two player
3000960	3001960	But the game itself
3001960	3003960	Was not two player simultaneous
3003960	3004960	Like it was in the arcade
3004960	3005960	I think Double Dragon 2 had that
3005960	3007960	But not the first Double Dragon
3007960	3008960	So
3008960	3009960	It didn't
3009960	3010960	I know right
3010960	3011960	It didn't
3011960	3012960	No it didn't
3012960	3013960	And so
3013960	3014960	I don't know
3014960	3015960	We were going to play
3015960	3016960	River City Ransom
3016960	3017960	But then by that time
3017960	3018960	Dinner was done
3018960	3019960	So we never
3019960	3020960	Got around to playing
3020960	3021960	That stuff
3021960	3022960	So maybe a stream
3022960	3023960	Later in the week
3023960	3024960	I don't know
3024960	3025960	But anyway
3025960	3026960	The reason why I brought all that up
3026960	3027960	It does tie into the Sony thing
3027960	3028960	I'm not trying to take the spotlight off this
3028960	3029960	But you were talking about
3029960	3030960	When does that thing get hacked
3030960	3031960	Well the Nintendo thing
3031960	3033960	Got hacked within 24 hours
3033960	3035960	They were running Kirby on that thing
3035960	3036960	By loading the ROM
3036960	3037960	So
3037960	3038960	And that's
3038960	3039960	Was kind of
3039960	3040960	A shocking
3040960	3041960	Well I don't want to say shocked
3041960	3042960	You probably weren't shocked Loki
3042960	3043960	But in some ways I think
3043960	3044960	I was so surprised
3044960	3045960	Some of us were really
3045960	3047960	Having to deal with the reality of
3047960	3049960	Nintendo was not doing anything
3049960	3050960	To tweak these games
3050960	3051960	To run online
3051960	3052960	They were not in there
3052960	3053960	Doing with the code or anything
3053960	3057960	Nintendo is artificially holding back
3057960	3059960	Releasing games on this thing
3059960	3061960	Because there is nothing
3061960	3062960	To prevent
3062960	3064960	Nintendo first party titles anyway
3064960	3066960	From being on Netflix today
3066960	3068960	Like Super Mario Brothers 2
3068960	3070960	No reason that should be missing right now
3070960	3072960	Kirby
3072960	3074960	No reason that should be missing right now
3074960	3075960	Things that are first party
3075960	3077960	Now I completely understand
3077960	3079960	You may have licensing things with Konami
3079960	3081960	Although they have Gradius today
3081960	3082960	You may still have things with Capcom
3082960	3083960	You know I understand
3083960	3085960	Not everything could be there
3085960	3086960	Especially third party stuff
3086960	3088960	But as far as Nintendo first party stuff
3088960	3091960	It is artificially being held back
3091960	3092960	And so
3092960	3094960	I think a lot of us are kind of having to
3094960	3095960	Swallow that pill this week
3095960	3096960	That you know
3096960	3097960	Alright
3097960	3099960	This is how Nintendo is going to do it
3099960	3100960	I mean
3100960	3102960	Is it still the better alternative
3102960	3103960	To charging five dollars a game
3103960	3104960	Probably
3104960	3106960	But it is a little bit frustrating
3106960	3108960	That this could have been a big thing
3108960	3110960	This thing could have landed with a thud
3110960	3112960	And now it's kind of landing with a
3112960	3113960	Okay
3113960	3114960	Neat
3114960	3115960	Yeah they could have said
3115960	3116960	Hey Virtual Console 2.0
3116960	3118960	Now they have multiplayer
3118960	3119960	Here's a ton of games
3119960	3120960	We're going to sell to you
3120960	3121960	For like five bucks each
3121960	3122960	Or whatever
3122960	3123960	And people are like
3123960	3124960	Oh yeah
3124960	3125960	And they could have made so much money
3125960	3126960	And kept
3126960	3127960	And
3127960	3129960	Kept multiplayer free
3129960	3130960	So they would have
3130960	3131960	You know
3131960	3132960	The advantage of showing
3132960	3133960	Oh hey
3133960	3134960	We don't
3134960	3135960	Because you know
3135960	3136960	They could probably make up that
3136960	3137960	Twenty bucks in Virtual Console sales
3137960	3138960	Easy
3138960	3139960	You know
3139960	3140960	Because some people are going to purchase
3140960	3141960	More some less
3141960	3142960	And they could have
3142960	3143960	Hey look
3143960	3145960	We don't charge for our multiplayer
3145960	3146960	But no
3146960	3147960	No
3147960	3148960	They didn't do that
3148960	3149960	Instead
3149960	3150960	Nintendo fans
3150960	3151960	Are going to stop them
3151960	3152960	Hackers proved
3152960	3153960	That
3153960	3154960	This hold back is artificial
3154960	3155960	This week
3155960	3156960	So
3156960	3157960	Take
3157960	3158960	Take what it is
3158960	3159960	Uh
3159960	3160960	Let's see
3160960	3161960	Act Efton Chat says
3161960	3162960	I can play Kirby's Adventure
3162960	3163960	And I have it on the Wii
3163960	3164960	And 3DS on the 3D Classic
3164960	3165960	So I can wait
3165960	3166960	Uh
3166960	3167960	Dark Tetsuya says
3167960	3168960	My only explanation is
3168960	3169960	Perhaps they didn't want people
3169960	3170960	To be overwhelmed
3170960	3172960	With a hundred games at launch
3172960	3173960	Why not though?
3173960	3175960	Imagine what a bombshell that would have been
3175960	3176960	If it's like
3176960	3177960	Dude we just opened the fucking floodgates
3177960	3179960	I can think of one reason
3179960	3180960	Their eShop
3180960	3181960	Is
3181960	3182960	Fucking
3182960	3183960	Terrible
3183960	3184960	Is why
3184960	3185960	And discoverability on that
3185960	3186960	Would be fucking terrible
3186960	3188960	It's all in one package
3188960	3189960	Oh yeah
3189960	3190960	You're not downloading game
3190960	3191960	By game by game
3191960	3192960	It's one
3192960	3193960	NES
3193960	3194960	And then once you get in there
3194960	3195960	You have all the different box arts
3195960	3196960	And things
3196960	3197960	But I believe
3197960	3198960	I didn't play a lot with this
3198960	3199960	I believe you can rearrange them
3199960	3201960	And pin your favorites to the top
3201960	3202960	You can kind of play with it
3202960	3204960	It's no worse than
3204960	3207960	Actually using Netflix
3207960	3208960	And I'm sure when the library
3208960	3209960	Does get bigger
3209960	3210960	You'll probably see similar
3210960	3211960	Stuff
3211960	3212960	Is it to not devalue the
3212960	3213960	NES Classic
3213960	3214960	Maybe?
3214960	3215960	I mean
3215960	3216960	Maybe
3216960	3217960	Because like
3217960	3218960	Isn't there a lot of overlap
3218960	3219960	In the NES Classic
3219960	3220960	In what this offers
3220960	3221960	I mean as far as like games
3221960	3222960	Uh
3222960	3223960	There
3223960	3224960	It's not a hundred percent
3224960	3225960	But certainly
3225960	3226960	Things like Mario Brothers
3226960	3227960	Mario 3
3227960	3228960	Zelda
3228960	3229960	Absolutely there's overlap
3229960	3230960	But there are things
3230960	3231960	Like Simon's Quest
3231960	3232960	Is on the NES Classic
3232960	3233960	It is not on
3233960	3234960	The Nintendo Switch thing
3234960	3235960	The Nintendo Switch thing
3235960	3236960	Has
3236960	3237960	Um
3237960	3238960	I don't believe
3238960	3239960	Is on the NES Classic
3239960	3240960	No I don't think so
3240960	3241960	So
3241960	3242960	You know
3242960	3243960	There are games on the
3243960	3244960	Swi-
3244960	3245960	So it's not a hundred percent
3245960	3246960	Overlap
3246960	3247960	But the
3247960	3248960	The first party stuff
3248960	3249960	Is mostly overlap
3249960	3250960	I think
3250960	3251960	I don't think Ice Hockey
3251960	3252960	Is on the
3252960	3253960	NES Classic
3253960	3254960	It is
3254960	3255960	I only
3255960	3256960	Impartial of that
3256960	3257960	Because I actually
3257960	3258960	Some of those black box games
3258960	3259960	Man I could just do without
3259960	3260960	Yeah
3260960	3261960	I mean
3261960	3262960	Sports ones
3262960	3263960	Nah I know
3263960	3264960	Forget that
3264960	3265960	Alright
3265960	3266960	You need Blades of Steel now
3266960	3267960	I'm sorry
3267960	3268960	To deviate the conversation
3268960	3269960	But I thought that
3269960	3270960	That hacking point
3270960	3271960	Kind of opened the door
3271960	3272960	To this other thing
3272960	3273960	That was really important
3273960	3274960	So talking about
3274960	3275960	The Sony thing for a minute
3275960	3276960	Where's your head at
3276960	3277960	With this Loki
3277960	3278960	Because for me
3278960	3279960	I'm
3279960	3280960	I'm kind of burned out
3280960	3281960	On these classic things
3281960	3282960	And this Sony thing
3282960	3283960	I'm sorry
3283960	3284960	This Sony thing
3284960	3285960	Does not sound like
3285960	3286960	It's worth
3286960	3287960	The premium price
3287960	3288960	They're charging for it
3288960	3289960	Um
3289960	3290960	I have to see
3290960	3291960	What other games are in there
3291960	3292960	I like
3292960	3293960	The idea
3293960	3294960	Of it
3294960	3295960	Um
3295960	3296960	I like
3296960	3297960	The better idea
3297960	3298960	Of hacking it apart
3298960	3299960	Because
3299960	3300960	You know the storage on that sucker
3300960	3301960	Is going to be pretty big
3301960	3302960	If it's got
3302960	3303960	You know
3303960	3304960	20 CD-ROM games in there
3304960	3305960	I mean
3305960	3306960	Especially when you're talking
3306960	3307960	Final Fantasy 7
3307960	3308960	Is three CD-ROMs
3308960	3309960	Right
3309960	3310960	Um
3310960	3311960	And I think Wild Arms
3311960	3312960	Is multiple as well
3312960	3313960	So
3313960	3314960	It'd be interesting to see
3314960	3315960	How that works
3315960	3316960	But
3316960	3317960	See especially
3317960	3318960	Like Final Fantasy 7
3318960	3319960	There's a great title
3319960	3320960	That I'm just
3320960	3321960	I'm burned out on it now
3321960	3322960	Yeah
3322960	3323960	I don't really care about 7
3323960	3324960	So much being on there
3324960	3325960	I mean like
3325960	3327120	It would be better though
3327120	3328120	If it was just on the
3328120	3329640	Goddamn PlayStation 4
3329640	3330640	Thank you
3330640	3331640	Is what it is
3331640	3332640	Thank you
3332640	3333640	And they sell them
3333640	3334640	On the PlayStation 4
3334640	3335640	It's like these remasters
3335640	3336640	But
3336640	3337640	So but
3337640	3338640	By the way guys
3338640	3339640	This thing
3339640	3340640	With the classes
3340640	3341640	This answers the question
3341640	3342720	When will PlayStation 1 games
3342720	3344280	Be playable on PlayStation 4
3344280	3345280	Here's your answer
3345280	3346280	Never
3346280	3347280	This proves it
3347280	3348280	Never
3348280	3349280	This is not in Sony's plan
3349280	3350280	To ever make those
3350280	3351280	PlayStation 1 games
3351280	3352280	That you just pop in your disc
3352280	3353280	And play them on the PlayStation 4
3353280	3354280	Nope
3354280	3355280	So guys now showing them
3355280	3356280	Hey you could charge them for it
3356280	3357280	All over again
3357280	3358280	And get away with it
3358280	3359280	And now they're gonna do it
3359280	3360280	And
3360280	3361280	But for me honestly
3361280	3362280	Again
3362280	3363280	They're charging a premium price
3363280	3364280	For this compared to Nintendo
3364280	3365960	I realize it's a more advanced console
3365960	3366960	But it's
3366960	3368080	It's over 20 years old
3368080	3370280	None of it is that advanced anymore
3370280	3371880	They're charging a hundred bucks for it
3371880	3372960	And they are shorting you
3372960	3374840	With the power cord
3374840	3375840	Which I understand
3375840	3377440	Like 3DS's don't come with chargers
3377440	3378440	But this is
3378440	3379520	This is a different conversation
3379520	3380520	With these classics
3380520	3381520	Because what
3381520	3382520	It's USB power
3382520	3383520	So they
3383760	3384760	They plug it into your TV
3384760	3385760	That's USB powered or something
3385760	3386760	I don't know
3386760	3387760	Eh
3387760	3388760	So or you have a charger
3388760	3389760	Or buy a Sony charger
3389760	3390760	Uh
3390760	3391760	So for whatever reason
3391760	3392760	They're skimming on that
3392760	3394040	My biggest thing that surprises me
3394040	3395680	Is the lack of DualShock
3395680	3396680	That
3396680	3398040	When Sony got the DualShock
3398040	3399080	Was when the PlayStation
3399080	3400080	Really start to
3400080	3401080	Took off
3401080	3402080	Take off
3402080	3403080	Because I don't know
3403080	3404080	If you guys remember
3404080	3405080	The PlayStation at first
3405080	3406360	Did not take off
3406360	3407360	The way that it did
3407360	3408360	A couple
3408360	3409360	Like remember when the PlayStation games
3409360	3411520	Were in those big ol' boxes
3411520	3412520	That's when they
3412520	3413520	The first came out
3413520	3414520	The PlayStation games
3414520	3415520	Were in those big ol' boxes
3415520	3416520	It wasn't until like
3416520	3417520	A year or two later
3417520	3418520	When DualShock came out
3418520	3419520	They kind of soft relaunched
3419520	3420520	The system
3420520	3421520	With some of the games
3421520	3422520	That they had then
3422520	3423520	And then they started
3423520	3424520	They scaled it down
3424520	3425520	To the CD size stuff
3425520	3426520	And you know
3426520	3427520	It started selling a lot better
3427520	3428520	So it's really weird to me
3428520	3429520	That this mini system
3429520	3431520	Represents that earlier era
3431520	3432520	Of PlayStation
3432520	3435520	Even though it's in the mini form
3435520	3436520	Uh
3436520	3437520	And not the later era
3437520	3438520	Of PlayStation
3438520	3439520	It's just kind of weird to me
3439520	3440520	So
3440520	3441520	Yeah
3441520	3442520	I don't know
3442520	3443520	I'm curious
3443520	3444520	I don't know
3444520	3445520	I
3445520	3446520	Kaijuto says
3446520	3447520	No I don't want that shit
3447520	3448520	On my PlayStation 4
3448520	3449520	Well
3449520	3450520	Okay
3450520	3451520	But some of us do
3451520	3453520	I still enjoy playing retro classics
3453520	3454520	They have like PlayStation
3454520	3456520	I have a copy of Tekken 3
3456520	3457520	Like
3457520	3458520	I have some of the old
3458520	3459520	Like PlayStation 2 games
3459520	3460520	That they've remastered
3460520	3461520	Or whatever
3461520	3462520	Like they have
3462520	3463520	Uh
3463520	3465520	Like the Warriors for example
3465520	3466520	Or
3466520	3467520	But at least they remastered those
3467520	3468520	At least they remastered those
3468520	3469520	Well
3469520	3470520	I mean
3471520	3472520	I still have my Blamecast
3472520	3473520	It would be nice
3473520	3475520	To be able to just pop in the PS1 disc
3475520	3476520	Like I did on the PlayStation 3
3476520	3478520	That kind of set that expectation
3478520	3479520	If you're wondering like
3479520	3482520	Why am I holding Sony accountable to this
3482520	3484520	Because you could do it on the PlayStation 3
3484520	3486520	And so it feels like it's a little bit of a step backwards
3486520	3487520	And
3487520	3488520	Let's not forget
3488520	3489520	Microsoft is sitting over here
3489520	3490520	Trying to work
3490520	3492520	To make original Xbox games playable
3492520	3493520	On Xbox One
3493520	3494520	Well here's the other funnier thing too
3494520	3495520	When you think about this too
3495520	3496520	Like
3496520	3498520	And I saw the comparisons almost immediately
3498520	3499520	When the PlayStation Classic came out
3499520	3500520	They're like
3500520	3501520	PlayStation Classic
3501520	3505520	Can play all these PlayStation 1 games
3505520	3507520	Or you could get a PlayStation TV
3507520	3509520	For like 30 bucks
3509520	3511520	Have DualShock support
3511520	3513520	And it could also play PlayStation 1 games
3513520	3515520	And Vita games
3515520	3517520	And whatever else that you want to throw on there
3517520	3518520	I mean
3518520	3519520	That's the other rub too
3519520	3520520	Is like
3520520	3522520	Well you could have supported that system
3522520	3524520	And it could have done all this shit as well
3524520	3526520	And it didn't cost as much
3526520	3527520	Bobby Blackwolf in chat is asking
3527520	3530520	So in 20 years what will be on the PlayStation 4 Classic?
3530520	3531520	Uh
3531520	3532520	Horizon Zero Dawn
3532520	3533520	Last Guardian
3533520	3534520	Um
3534520	3536520	Probably like a lot of the first party Sony stuff
3536520	3537520	Spider-Man
3537520	3538520	Oh sure
3538520	3539520	Oh yeah the Spider-Man game
3539520	3540520	Infamous
3540520	3541520	Uh
3541520	3542520	The Last of Us remastered
3542520	3543520	Definitive Edition
3543520	3544520	Whatever it is
3544520	3546520	Last of Us 2 inevitably will be something that would probably be on there too
3546520	3548520	Or the PlayStation 3 Classic
3548520	3550520	Which will not have Rumble either
3550520	3552520	Because it's gonna just be 6X's
3552520	3554520	It's not gonna be before they have the DualShock 3
3554520	3555520	You know back when they were like
3555520	3556520	You don't need Rumble
3556520	3559520	We didn't pay the license ad again
3559520	3560520	But you don't need it
3560520	3562520	Alright well speaking of classics
3562520	3565520	I know this is one that folks here at Orange Lounge Radio can get behind
3565520	3567520	Did you know
3567520	3572520	Dance Dance Revolution's 20th anniversary is this week
3572520	3574520	In fact in two days
3574520	3577520	Konami is scheduled to make some sort of announcement
3577520	3578520	Uh
3578520	3579520	To celebrate
3579520	3580520	Please don't suck
3580520	3581520	20th anniversary
3581520	3583520	Could that be a new home version?
3583520	3586520	Or is it more likely a new release in arcades
3586520	3589520	I think maybe a new release in arcades
3589520	3590520	Maybe
3590520	3591520	Hopefully not a mobile game
3591520	3592520	But like you know
3592520	3593520	Oh god
3593520	3595520	Not a mobile game
3595520	3596520	Shake out
3596520	3599520	I hope it's a new game
3599520	3601520	It's been a couple years since Ace
3601520	3602520	Yeah it's been a couple years since Ace
3602520	3605520	Although I thought Ace was supposed to be the game that's like forever expandable
3605520	3606520	But maybe you know maybe they'll
3606520	3608520	Yeah well so are like all the other like
3608520	3610520	Beatmania games
3611520	3612520	I know
3612520	3614520	So what would DDR be
3614520	3616520	Will be the big 20th anniversary
3616520	3619520	No they'll go with some stupid naming convention like they have with 2DX
3619520	3620520	Like it's just
3620520	3621520	Call whatever they want
3621520	3622520	Whatever the fuck they want to call it
3622520	3623520	20
3623520	3624520	DDR20
3624520	3625520	Yeah pumpkin spice
3625520	3626520	Pumpkin spice mix
3626520	3627520	I like that
3627520	3628520	You know I'd be down for that
3628520	3629520	Dark Tetsuya thinks
3629520	3632520	I'm thinking DDRXX
3632520	3633520	No too many people
3633520	3634520	Especially
3634520	3636520	They are gonna be thinking about America at least a little bit
3636520	3638520	And they know that DDRXX
3638520	3640520	Is too close to DDRXX
3640520	3642520	Which is gonna have a very different type of connotation
3642520	3644520	No I would
3644520	3646520	I would hope something that
3646520	3647520	I don't know
3647520	3648520	I just hope it's not lame
3648520	3650520	Maybe DDRXX or something
3650520	3651520	I don't know
3651520	3652520	But I thought about
3652520	3653520	Well and X is too confusing too
3653520	3655520	Cause X is it's own series so
3655520	3656520	True
3656520	3657520	And so they can't really
3657520	3658520	And they already have an X2
3658520	3659520	That's true
3659520	3660520	So they can't really do that
3660520	3661520	I mean
3661520	3663520	Let's just go max 3
3663520	3665520	That's just extreme
3665520	3666520	They already extreme too
3666520	3667520	DDR20th mix
3667520	3668520	Just call it that
3668520	3669520	20th anniversary yeah
3669520	3670520	Well I mean
3670520	3671520	It's
3671520	3672520	Isn't it weird to think though
3672520	3675520	DDR is 20 years old
3675520	3677520	And we were kind of there at the beginning-ish
3677520	3678520	I mean
3678520	3679520	What this show
3679520	3680520	OLR started
3680520	3682520	4 years into that right
3682520	3684520	Cause we started 2002
3684520	3687520	And I think most of us were playing DDR first in 2001
3687520	3688520	If not sooner
3688520	3690520	Like Jamie was probably there in 99
3690520	3692520	I remember seeing it in 2000
3692520	3694520	Well I had my
3694520	3696520	My birthday
3697520	3698520	I got my second mix
3698520	3699520	For Dreamcast
3701520	3703520	But yeah I think I was playing
3703520	3705520	I wanna say around 2000
3705520	3707520	Cause we had found
3707520	3709520	Where did we find that machine?
3711520	3712520	It wasn't at Golfland
3712520	3713520	It was
3713520	3715520	We all met in 2000
3715520	3716520	You were playing before then
3716520	3717520	Cause we all met in 2000
3717520	3718520	Cause that was
3718520	3719520	I played at Anime Expo
3719520	3720520	Yeah
3720520	3721520	That was the year I lived at Melrose Place
3721520	3722520	It was 2000
3722520	3723520	January 2000
3723520	3724520	Yeah
3724520	3725520	At Anime Expo Disneyland
3725520	3727520	And they had a third mix there
3727520	3728520	And they told me how to do Vivid
3728520	3731520	And I was singing along with Xanadu
3731520	3732520	You know
3732520	3733520	And like
3733520	3734520	I thought you never played before
3734520	3735520	People would say
3735520	3736520	And be like
3736520	3738520	But I've seen Xanadu 57 million times
3738520	3740520	It's Olivia Newton-John
3740520	3741520	Olivia Newton-John people
3741520	3742520	Is that why it's called the Olivia Pro-
3742520	3743520	No shit
3745520	3747520	As the same Anime Expo where
3747520	3748520	The Chair
3749520	3751520	The Chair was a character of that Anime Expo
3751520	3752520	I wasn't
3752520	3753520	I wasn't around for this
3753520	3754520	The Chair
3754520	3755520	The Chair
3755520	3756520	I've never been to Anime Expo
3756520	3757520	And I plan to keep it that way
3757520	3758520	I have a picture of Chair
3758520	3760520	On the DDR machine
3760520	3761520	Okay
3761520	3762520	This was yeah
3762520	3763520	This was the one time it was the Disneyland hotel
3763520	3765520	And the cosplayers kept getting kicked out of the park
3765520	3767520	Oh I heard about all that fuckery
3767520	3769520	It's the reason why they didn't do it there again since
3769520	3770520	Alright anyway
3770520	3772520	SD200Matt talking about DDR20 in our chat saying
3772520	3773520	So a few months ago
3773520	3775520	The top DDR players took to Twitter
3775520	3776520	To ask Konami
3776520	3778520	Make things better with DDR with a number
3778520	3779520	I don't remember what it was
3779520	3781520	Konami actually responded to them
3781520	3782520	And said
3782520	3784520	We hear you and we have big things in the works
3785520	3786520	And then we got
3786520	3787520	Dancing Sta-
3787520	3788520	Or what was the
3788520	3789520	Dance Fl-
3789520	3790520	What the fuck's that new one
3790520	3791520	That everybody's losing their shit about
3791520	3792520	Dance Rush
3792520	3793520	Which I still haven't played
3793520	3794520	No me neither
3794520	3795520	Wah
3795520	3796520	That's what I should have done this weekend
3796520	3798520	Taken an impromptu trip to round one to play that
3798520	3799520	Cause I still haven't played it
3799520	3800520	Well
3800520	3802520	I can't wait for my fat old ass to get on that machine
3802520	3804520	Wait so long enough it'll be down here
3804520	3805520	Yeah it's true
3805520	3806520	It's true if I wait long enough
3806520	3807520	Alright
3807520	3808520	Anyway
3809520	3810520	Alright
3810520	3811520	Let's move on
3811520	3812520	To our Sakura
3812520	3814520	I mean god we've had all this news but
3814520	3816520	There was like a pretty big event going on
3816520	3817520	Across the ocean right
3817520	3818520	Yeah there was
3818520	3820520	And so I thought I would just go with
3820520	3821520	Some of the best
3822520	3824520	Ranked stuff that came out of Tokyo Game Show
3825520	3827520	And if any of this is
3827520	3829520	Comes up later on in the show
3829520	3831520	I'm not trying to step on any toes
3831520	3832520	I'm not gonna go into any
3832520	3834520	Type of detail about this
3834520	3836520	But I will just make the announcements
3837520	3838520	If that's cool with everybody
3839520	3841520	So Ace Combat 7 Skies Unknown
3841520	3842520	Is on the list
3842520	3844520	And it looks like it's got VR support
3845520	3847520	There also is going to be
3847520	3848520	Another Catherine game
3848520	3850520	Catherine Full Body
3850520	3852520	For PS4 and Vita
3852520	3853520	You know it's funny
3853520	3855520	I actually read the Catherine novels
3855520	3858520	Very interesting
3858520	3859520	I'll just leave it there
3860520	3862520	Also coming out is
3862520	3864520	Days Gone for PS4
3865520	3866520	But there was
3866520	3868520	A motorcycle to advertise it
3870520	3871520	Also
3872520	3873520	Looks like we have
3873520	3875520	Dead or Alive 6
3875520	3877520	And it looks very pretty with
3877520	3879520	Blood splatter for every punch
3881520	3882520	We also have
3882520	3884520	I'm waiting for some of these to load
3884520	3886520	Of course there's Death Stranding
3886520	3889520	So hopefully we'll know
3889520	3890520	More about this
3890520	3891520	Maybe
3892520	3893520	So you know what we saw
3893520	3894520	There was a trailer
3894520	3896520	With a dude in a golden mask
3896520	3897520	And it was revealed that
3897520	3899520	That guy was Troy Baker
3900520	3901520	And again
3901520	3902520	This game is very like
3902520	3903520	That's all I need to know
3903520	3904520	What is it?
3904520	3906520	What is this game?
3906520	3908520	There is a guy in like
3908520	3909520	Diving gear
3909520	3910520	Under water
3910520	3911520	But his gear is off
3911520	3912520	His face is
3912520	3913520	His mask is off
3914520	3916520	So whatever that is
3918520	3919520	So
3921520	3923520	God why is it taking so long to load
3925520	3926520	I'm sorry about this guys
3926520	3927520	There we go
3927520	3928520	So
3928520	3929520	Devil May Cry 5
3929520	3930520	Which
3930520	3931520	Yay
3932520	3934520	There'll be a little bit more about that
3934520	3935520	Coming up I know for sure
3936520	3938520	At least coming from the director
3938520	3939520	Of Devil May Cry 5
3941520	3942520	And then
3942520	3943520	Next up
3945520	3947520	Gosh I'm so sorry this is taking so long
3947520	3949520	Man Dead or Alive 6 looks awesome
3949520	3951520	Dragon Quest Builders 2
3952520	3953520	We knew that was coming
3953520	3954520	But we just haven't really
3954520	3955520	Seen the game itself yet
3955520	3956520	I don't believe
3956520	3957520	So
3957520	3958520	Or did
3958520	3959520	Did 1 and 2 never
3959520	3960520	I thought they were gonna get
3960520	3962520	A combo package on the Switch
3962520	3963520	Did that never happen?
3963520	3964520	I don't think so
3964520	3965520	Oh alright
3965520	3966520	I guess I thought that would've
3966520	3967520	Happened a long time ago
3967520	3968520	There's another game
3968520	3969520	Um
3969520	3971520	Coming up by Inti Creates
3971520	3972520	Um
3972520	3973520	But they did a game
3973520	3974520	Um
3974520	3976520	Called Dragon March for Death
3976520	3978520	This is the same studio that did
3978520	3979520	Mega Man Zero
3980520	3981520	Um
3981520	3982520	The art style looks really nice
3982520	3984520	There's also everybody's golf VR
3984520	3985520	Whatever it's golf
3986520	3987520	Uh
3987520	3989520	Fortnite was at Tokyo Game Show
3989520	3990520	That's interesting
3991520	3992520	Yeah
3992520	3993520	But it looks like people were
3993520	3994520	Playing the shit off of it
3994520	3995520	Is it though? Because
3995520	3996520	If it was
3996520	3997520	Was it
3997520	3998520	At Sony's booth because
3998520	3999520	You know that is the best console
3999520	4001520	To play it on according to Sony
4001520	4003520	Well no I'm more saying the fact that like
4003520	4005520	It feels like everywhere you go here
4005520	4006520	People are playing Fortnite
4006520	4007520	And people know of Fortnite
4007520	4008520	So it's interesting that Japan
4008520	4009520	I don't know if it's
4009520	4010520	That big
4010520	4011520	But it's still
4011520	4012520	Big enough
4012520	4013520	There's a
4013520	4014520	Yakuza game called
4014520	4016520	Judge Eyes coming out
4016520	4017520	Um
4017520	4018520	It looks interesting
4018520	4019520	There's also
4019520	4020520	Kingdom Hearts 3
4020520	4021520	Um
4021520	4022520	Mega Man 11
4022520	4023520	For PS4
4023520	4024520	Xbox One
4024520	4025520	We're getting a new
4025520	4026520	Kingdom Hearts game?
4026520	4027520	Eventually
4027520	4028520	Well they showed off
4028520	4029520	It was a trailer with
4029520	4030520	Big Hero 6
4030520	4031520	So that's kind of cool
4031520	4032520	Yeah no the new footage was cool
4032520	4033520	There's another game called
4033520	4034520	Ninjala
4034520	4035520	That's um
4035520	4036520	Kind of
4036520	4037520	Splatoon-ish
4037520	4038520	From what it looks like
4038520	4039520	But definitely different
4039520	4040520	Mechanics for PVP
4041520	4042520	Um
4044520	4046520	I'm almost to the list
4046520	4047520	Let's see
4047520	4048520	That looks like arms
4048520	4049520	Uh
4049520	4052520	Persona Q2 Full Cinema Labyrinth
4052520	4054520	Um
4054520	4056520	It looks
4056520	4058520	Interesting for its style
4058520	4059520	But definitely has the same
4059520	4061520	Dungeon crawling elements in it
4061520	4062520	Um
4062520	4063520	There's also
4063520	4064520	Resident Evil 2 remake
4064520	4066520	Which I am super excited about
4066520	4067520	Because
4067520	4068520	Hello they should have
4068520	4070520	Remade this a long time ago
4070520	4071520	Um
4071520	4075520	There's Tetris Effect for PS4 and PSVR
4075520	4078520	So it looks like it's Tetris with
4078520	4080520	A musical element
4080520	4081520	It's amazing
4081520	4082520	It's fucking
4082520	4083520	They showed this at E3
4083520	4084520	It's the rez guy
4084520	4086520	It's Mizuguchi doing Tetris
4086520	4087520	It looks fucking amazing
4087520	4090520	And then there's Warriors Orochi 4
4090520	4091520	Um
4091520	4092520	You know which is
4092520	4094520	Just those usual
4094520	4095520	Warriors game
4095520	4097520	Um
4097520	4098520	But it's actually
4098520	4099520	Um
4099520	4100520	Over there
4100520	4102520	It's actually Orochi Musou 3 in Japan
4102520	4103520	But we got it
4103520	4105520	As Warriors Orochi 4
4105520	4107520	Here in the US
4107520	4108520	Um
4108520	4109520	And then that's it
4109520	4110520	So those are things coming
4110520	4113520	The biggest hype coming out of Tokyo Game Show
4113520	4114520	I'd still like to go to Tokyo Game Show
4114520	4115520	One day
4115520	4116520	One day
4116520	4117520	One day
4117520	4118520	I know
4118520	4119520	My check will come
4119520	4120520	I know
4120520	4121520	One day I'll have money
4121520	4122520	Alright
4122520	4123520	Let's move on
4123520	4124520	Loki
4124520	4125520	Maybe some not so great news
4125520	4126520	Coming out of Tokyo Game Show
4126520	4127520	Right
4127520	4128520	Yeah
4128520	4129520	So
4129520	4130520	Um
4130520	4132520	Unfortunately
4132520	4134520	The uh
4134520	4136520	Lack of Sony being into the Vita
4136520	4138520	Is finally caught up with the Vita
4138520	4139520	In Japan
4139520	4140520	Because remember
4140520	4141520	Japan is doing pretty good over there
4141520	4142520	But now
4142520	4143520	The Vita's dead
4143520	4144520	And
4144520	4145520	Unfortunately
4145520	4146520	Sony doesn't have
4146520	4147520	Anything coming out
4147520	4148520	That's been announced
4148520	4150520	As a successor for the Vita
4150520	4151520	Um
4151520	4152520	But yeah
4152520	4153520	Basically
4153520	4154520	As for portable gaming machine
4154520	4155520	There are no plans for anything
4155520	4156520	After the Vita
4156520	4157520	Um
4157520	4158520	And right now
4158520	4159520	That there's no
4159520	4160520	Yeah
4160520	4161520	Hardware successor
4161520	4162520	That they're working on
4162520	4163520	So
4163520	4164520	That's unfortunate
4164520	4165520	Too bad
4165520	4166520	I'm surprised with the Switch being so
4166520	4167520	Powerful and everything
4167520	4168520	That
4168520	4169520	They might reconsider
4169520	4170520	Since you know
4170520	4171520	They like copying Nintendo obviously
4171520	4172520	With
4172520	4173520	Everything that they do
4173520	4174520	Yeah
4174520	4175520	I um
4175520	4176520	I mean I don't know
4176520	4177520	I am and I'm not surprised
4177520	4178520	To hear this
4178520	4179520	About the Vita
4179520	4180520	Like I still thought the Vita
4180520	4181520	Had anything to do
4181520	4182520	With the Vita
4182520	4183520	But
4183520	4184520	Yeah
4184520	4185520	I still thought the Vita
4185520	4186520	Had
4186520	4187520	A lot of life span
4187520	4188520	Going for it
4188520	4189520	In Japan
4189520	4190520	You know
4190520	4191520	I feel like when we do the Japanese releases
4191520	4192520	We're still having quite frequently
4192520	4194520	Japanese releases on the Vita
4194520	4195520	So
4195520	4196520	I thought for that
4196520	4197520	You know
4197520	4198520	Purpose
4198520	4199520	There would still be
4199520	4200520	You know
4200520	4201520	Some sort of official support
4201520	4202520	From Sony
4202520	4203520	Because Sony
4203520	4204520	Those games don't have to stop coming out
4204520	4205520	This is the Vita
4205520	4206520	I'm not quite dead
4206520	4207520	I think I'll go for
4207520	4208520	Well just because
4208520	4209520	Yes
4209520	4210520	But Sony's like
4210520	4211520	No you're dead
4211520	4212520	You know
4212520	4213520	Just because Sony
4213520	4214520	They might as well
4214520	4215520	You know
4215520	4216520	It's kind of
4216520	4217520	Once the company's kind of
4217520	4218520	Officially stopped
4218520	4219520	I mean
4219520	4220520	I get it
4220520	4221520	There's still people making games
4221520	4222520	To the Dreamcast
4222520	4223520	But
4223520	4224520	A lot of the
4224520	4225520	You know
4225520	4226520	You realize these are different things
4226520	4227520	I feel happy
4227520	4228520	Those sorts of pet projects
4228520	4229520	Are very different from
4229520	4230520	You know
4230520	4231520	The
4231520	4232520	Weekly releases
4232520	4233520	And all that stuff
4233520	4234520	So
4234520	4235520	I mean
4235520	4236520	As far as the US is concerned
4236520	4237520	I'm not surprised at all
4237520	4238520	To hear this
4238520	4239520	The Vita's been effectively dead here
4239520	4240520	For some time
4240520	4241520	Yeah
4241520	4242520	But it's
4243520	4244520	But I
4244520	4245520	To be honest
4245520	4246520	I don't want Sony
4246520	4247520	Doing another portable system
4247520	4248520	If they're gonna treat it
4248520	4249520	Like they did that one
4249520	4250520	Why should Sony do
4250520	4251520	Another portable system
4251520	4252520	If they're just gonna turn
4252520	4253520	Their back on it
4253520	4254520	So quickly
4254520	4256520	Like they did the last one
4256520	4257520	Like
4257520	4258520	I think it's for the best
4258520	4259520	They don't
4259520	4260520	Do another system
4260520	4261520	Anyway
4261520	4262520	Uh
4262520	4263520	Kaijuto says
4266520	4267520	No no
4267520	4268520	This is different
4268520	4269520	This is not talk about
4269520	4270520	How it feels
4270520	4271520	Dead in the US
4271520	4272520	This is Sony saying
4272520	4274520	We are pulling the plug
4274520	4275520	In 2019
4275520	4276520	So
4276520	4277520	This is much different
4277520	4278520	Than what usually comes up
4281520	4282520	Deft says
4282520	4283520	Vita means life
4283520	4284520	Well
4284520	4285520	Now your Vita
4285520	4286520	Is a
4286520	4287520	Huerta?
4287520	4288520	I don't know what to
4288520	4289520	Say
4290520	4291520	Alright
4291520	4292520	Uh
4292520	4293520	Let's move on
4293520	4294520	And talk about
4294520	4295520	I kind of referred to this
4295520	4296520	Already earlier
4296520	4297520	So I kind of repeating myself
4297520	4298520	A little bit
4298520	4299520	Sorry
4299520	4300520	But I just couldn't help
4300520	4301520	The servers did indeed
4301520	4302520	Already breach Nintendo's
4302520	4303520	Online system
4303520	4305520	So what happened is
4305520	4306520	That they were uploading
4306520	4307520	New NES ROMs
4307520	4308520	Into the library
4308520	4309520	Essentially
4309520	4310520	Uh
4310520	4311520	What they
4311520	4312520	I don't understand
4312520	4313520	All the inner workings
4313520	4314520	Of how this works
4314520	4315520	Maybe Loki you know more
4315520	4316520	About this stuff than I do
4316520	4317520	All I know is I saw the receipts
4317520	4318520	Somebody posted a video
4318520	4319520	Yeah
4319520	4320520	And they fired up a game
4320520	4321520	And it was not the game
4321520	4322520	That was
4322520	4323520	It was not River City Ransom
4323520	4324520	It was Kirby
4324520	4325520	So they
4325520	4326520	They were able to
4326520	4327520	Like swap out
4327520	4328520	One NES file for another
4328520	4329520	Yeah basically
4329520	4330520	They were stored as plain
4330520	4331520	NES ROMs
4331520	4332520	So it's just
4332520	4333520	The normal
4333520	4334520	ROM file for
4334520	4337520	Um
4337520	4338520	For an NES cartridge
4338520	4339520	So like they have
4339520	4340520	Battletoads
4340520	4341520	Is one that
4341520	4342520	They had a video of
4342520	4343520	That they took
4343520	4344520	Oh yeah I saw the
4344520	4345520	Battletoads one too
4345520	4346520	So you know
4346520	4347520	And as we got into
4347520	4348520	A little bit earlier
4348520	4349520	So not to repeat
4349520	4350520	Ourselves too bad
4350520	4351520	But basically you know
4351520	4352520	This does prove that
4352520	4353520	Nintendo
4353520	4354520	Has done all this work
4354520	4355520	On the emulator
4355520	4356520	To be able to do
4356520	4357520	The online games
4357520	4358520	And all that
4358520	4359520	And release all of their
4359520	4360520	Games right now
4360520	4361520	If they wanted to
4361520	4362520	They have chosen not to
4362520	4363520	For whatever
4363520	4364520	Yeah but I don't know
4364520	4365520	Like obviously we haven't seen
4365520	4366520	This like play
4366520	4367520	In online or something
4367520	4368520	Like that
4368520	4369520	Like with other people
4369520	4370520	I would assume that
4370520	4371520	It's all emulator based
4371520	4372520	So but
4372520	4373520	Um
4373520	4374520	You know
4374520	4375520	They could use that
4375520	4376520	As the excuse of
4376520	4377520	Well these games
4377520	4378520	Need to be changed
4378520	4379520	For
4379520	4380520	I don't think so though
4380520	4381520	It's just
4381520	4382520	It's just they're not
4382520	4383520	Well also with the
4383520	4384520	Nintendo online
4384520	4385520	You know there's
4385520	4386520	Different filters
4386520	4387520	And different modes
4387520	4388520	And filters you can use
4388520	4389520	As CRT
4389520	4390520	Where you can kind of
4390520	4391520	Purposely make your screen
4391520	4392520	Look dirty
4392520	4393520	Like an old television
4393520	4394520	Would have looked
4394520	4395520	Which you know
4395520	4396520	Or if you have kids
4396520	4397520	You don't have to do that
4397520	4398520	At all
4398520	4399520	It's naturally dirty
4399520	4400520	If you want the authentic
4400520	4401520	Look or whatever
4401520	4402520	I guess you could go for that
4402520	4403520	Filters can be fun
4403520	4404520	But some people saying
4404520	4405520	Taking to social media
4405520	4406520	Saying
4406520	4407520	The CRT TV
4407520	4408520	Is causing
4408520	4409520	Burn in
4409520	4410520	On my
4410520	4411520	Or at least something
4411520	4412520	That kind of looks like it
4412520	4413520	This went up to Reddit
4413520	4414520	And basically said
4414520	4415520	Some NES games
4415520	4416520	There's discoloration
4416520	4417520	On the Switch screen
4417520	4418520	After this
4418520	4419520	So
4419520	4420520	They did
4420520	4421520	They posted all this stuff
4421520	4422520	But
4422520	4423520	Apparently
4423520	4424520	It's a rendering issue
4424520	4425520	And not actually
4425520	4426520	Any type of burn in
4426520	4427520	It's not
4427520	4428520	It's just a rendering thing
4428520	4429520	It's displaying
4429520	4430520	The
4430520	4431520	The
4431520	4432520	Stuff on the menu
4432520	4433520	Kind of like it's
4433520	4434520	Bleeding through
4434520	4435520	From the rendering
4435520	4436520	Of the NES game
4436520	4437520	Or something like that
4437520	4438520	Nintendo did not officially
4438520	4439520	Comment on all this stuff
4439520	4440520	But it doesn't sound like
4440520	4441520	It's as bad
4441520	4442520	As the internet
4442520	4443520	Was making it out to be
4443520	4444520	Because that's never
4444520	4445520	Happened before
4445520	4446520	But also
4446520	4447520	Eh
4447520	4449520	Don't use that CRT filter
4449520	4450520	Well that
4450520	4451520	And also like
4451520	4452520	I just
4452520	4453520	Eh
4453520	4454520	I would
4454520	4455520	Oh
4455520	4456520	Minimal viable product
4456520	4458520	Is a phrase I like to use
4458520	4459520	You know
4459520	4460520	At work
4460520	4461520	And with a lot of things
4461520	4462520	And
4462520	4463520	So for as long as this
4463520	4464520	Took to happen
4464520	4465520	There's still weird shit
4465520	4466520	Like this out there
4466520	4467520	Yeah it's just like that
4467520	4468520	You know
4468520	4469520	They used the same damn
4469520	4472520	Emulator that they made for
4472520	4473520	The NES Classic and stuff
4473520	4474520	I'm not gonna complain
4474520	4475520	That they were giving us
4475520	4476520	Online play for free
4476520	4478520	All this extra time
4478520	4480520	Since Nintendo Online
4480520	4481520	Real
4481520	4482520	Really the NES classes
4482520	4483520	Is really the only new thing
4483520	4484520	At least it feels like anyway
4484520	4485520	That we're getting with them
4485520	4486520	But it does feel pathetic
4486520	4487520	Though that they can't even
4487520	4488520	Get that to run correctly
4488520	4489520	I mean they shouldn't even
4489520	4490520	Have a mode that
4490520	4491520	Toggle low latency
4491520	4492520	You should just
4492520	4493520	Be on
4493520	4494520	If that's what it takes
4494520	4495520	To run
4495520	4496520	Like I don't even understand
4496520	4497520	The problem is
4497520	4498520	And not just a knock
4498520	4499520	Um
4499520	4500520	I do
4500520	4501520	I do want to stress though
4501520	4502520	Our situation with him
4502520	4503520	Streaming in my
4503520	4504520	But not even necessarily
4504520	4505520	Just this
4505520	4506520	Like the Capcom
4506520	4507520	Arcade collection
4507520	4508520	That just came out
4508520	4509520	That beat him up one
4509520	4510520	Is fucked
4510520	4511520	When it comes to
4511520	4512520	Online mode
4512520	4514520	And the Switch as well
4514520	4515520	And they have like
4515520	4516520	Lag issues like
4516520	4517520	It's just like
4517520	4518520	It's stuttery
4518520	4519520	It's so bad
4519520	4520520	But that's just
4520520	4521520	Another issue
4521520	4522520	It's like
4522520	4523520	Come on you guys
4523520	4524520	You know that this
4524520	4525520	Probably exists
4525520	4526520	Why
4526520	4527520	Why not
4527520	4528520	Hold it off
4528520	4529520	A little bit longer
4530520	4531520	Alright
4531520	4532520	Let's move on
4532520	4533520	We have a few more
4533520	4534520	Stories to get to
4534520	4535520	Uh
4535520	4536520	Darcyra
4536520	4537520	Well
4537520	4538520	As I might have teased
4538520	4539520	Earlier
4539520	4540520	There was
4540520	4541520	Uh
4541520	4542520	Something from
4542520	4543520	The Devil May Cry director
4543520	4544520	And this is not
4544520	4545520	Quite what people
4545520	4546520	Think it is
4546520	4547520	Um
4547520	4548520	Uh
4548520	4549520	There was
4549520	4550520	Um
4550520	4551520	An interview
4551520	4552520	With him
4552520	4553520	Very recently
4553520	4554520	Um
4554520	4555520	Uh
4555520	4556520	It's no
4556520	4557520	Hideaki
4557520	4558520	And he was asked
4558520	4559520	The question
4559520	4560520	If he would like
4560520	4561520	To
4562520	4563520	And I'm just gonna
4563520	4564520	Read his whole
4564520	4565520	Response here
4565520	4566520	If I was allowed
4566520	4567520	I'd love to remake
4567520	4568520	Love to make
4568520	4569520	Rival Schools 3
4569520	4570520	I'd love to make
4570520	4571520	Dragon's Dogma 2
4571520	4572520	Capcom vs. SNK 3
4572520	4573520	Street Fighter Alpha 4
4573520	4574520	Power Stone 3
4574520	4575520	And if I could
4575520	4576520	Even Street Fighter 6
4576520	4577520	Would be amazing
4577520	4578520	But the big one
4578520	4579520	The one that we'd need
4579520	4580520	To get resolution on
4580520	4581520	Is Rival Schools
4581520	4582520	Because in Japan
4582520	4583520	There are three years
4583520	4584520	Of high school
4584520	4585520	We've seen the first
4585520	4586520	Two years for these kids
4586520	4587520	So the third one
4587520	4588520	Would be their last year
4588520	4589520	In high school
4589520	4590520	Wouldn't that be cool
4591520	4592520	Yes
4592520	4594520	Please make this happen
4594520	4596520	I'm going to find his Twitter
4596520	4597520	And I'm going to post
4597520	4598520	Every day Rival Schools 3
4598520	4599520	Rival Schools 3
4599520	4600520	Hashtag
4600520	4601520	Hashtag
4601520	4602520	Hashtag
4602520	4603520	Um
4604520	4605520	So
4605520	4607520	We need to get on this people
4607520	4609520	We made President Kat happen
4609520	4611520	Ha ha ha ha
4611520	4613520	Or we didn't make it happen
4613520	4615520	It never did come out in the US
4615520	4616520	Still
4616520	4618520	We encouraged them
4618520	4619520	And
4619520	4621520	If some sites are to be believed
4621520	4622520	It was like the worst selling Wii game
4622520	4623520	Of all time
4623520	4624520	So I'm not sure we actually
4624520	4625520	Made anything happen there
4625520	4626520	Dr. Sakura
4626520	4627520	Ha ha ha
4627520	4628520	It was just too
4628520	4629520	Too early
4629520	4630520	I know
4630520	4631520	It was ahead of its time
4631520	4632520	Yeah we were just extremely hipster
4632520	4633520	That's all
4633520	4634520	Because now we have
4634520	4635520	You know other
4635520	4636520	Cat centered games
4636520	4637520	Like cat lateral damage
4637520	4638520	And stuff like that
4638520	4639520	Yeah
4639520	4640520	Can't tell me something
4640520	4641520	Cat based
4641520	4642520	Won't sell well
4642520	4643520	In this type of internet
4643520	4644520	Ha ha
4644520	4645520	See if we brought it out
4645520	4646520	Over here
4646520	4647520	It would be
4647520	4648520	Asshole CEO
4649520	4650520	All right
4650520	4651520	Let's move on
4651520	4652520	Loki
4652520	4654520	So YouTube is closing
4654520	4655520	YouTube gaming
4655520	4656520	Because
4656520	4658520	Nobody likes to use the app
4658520	4659520	And
4659520	4660520	That's unfortunate
4660520	4661520	But
4661520	4662520	It's not
4662520	4663520	Entirely bad
4663520	4664520	So basically what they're doing
4664520	4665520	Is they're getting rid of
4665520	4666520	The dedicated app
4666520	4667520	For YouTube gaming
4667520	4668520	Because once again
4668520	4669520	A lot of people are just using
4669520	4670520	The main YouTube app
4670520	4672520	To watch YouTube gaming content
4672520	4673520	Instead
4673520	4674520	If you still want to
4674520	4675520	You know
4675520	4676520	Interested in just
4676520	4677520	The gaming content
4677520	4678520	For one
4678520	4679520	It kind of
4679520	4680520	Focused like that
4680520	4681520	You can go to
4681520	4682520	YouTube slash gaming
4682520	4683520	And it will show you
4683520	4684520	The same damn shit
4684520	4685520	So
4685520	4686520	And they kind of
4686520	4687520	Kind of set up
4687520	4688520	A little bit like
4688520	4689520	Twitch as well
4689520	4690520	When you look at it
4690520	4691520	That way
4691520	4692520	With all your
4692520	4693520	You know
4693520	4694520	Top live games
4694520	4696520	Live streamers
4696520	4697520	Gaming videos
4697520	4698520	From your subscriptions
4698520	4700520	That type of stuff
4700520	4701520	You know
4701520	4702520	I don't know
4702520	4703520	Like I think
4703520	4704520	With YouTube gaming
4704520	4705520	Like it was hard
4705520	4706520	Most people didn't
4706520	4707520	But there was a
4707520	4708520	Separate thing
4708520	4709520	Like if you want to
4709520	4710520	Look up gaming videos
4710520	4711520	Just go to YouTube
4711520	4712520	Exactly
4712520	4713520	I'm not going to fucking
4713520	4714520	Go to a separate app
4714520	4715520	For gaming
4715520	4716520	And like
4716520	4717520	I'll just watch it
4717520	4718520	On YouTube
4718520	4719520	Yeah I think that
4719520	4720520	Kind of like
4720520	4721520	Never like
4721520	4722520	Truly caught on
4722520	4723520	I really think
4723520	4724520	The YouTube gaming thing
4724520	4725520	Was really primarily
4725520	4726520	For the app
4726520	4727520	But when anything
4727520	4728520	You link online
4728520	4729520	And stuff
4729520	4730520	Is going to open
4730520	4731520	In the default
4731520	4732520	YouTube app
4732520	4733520	Like if I
4733520	4734520	If I tweet
4734520	4735520	My YouTube or something
4735520	4736520	YouTube gaming
4736520	4737520	Was always just kind of like
4737520	4738520	This different shell
4738520	4739520	This different set of clothes
4739520	4740520	That nobody went for
4740520	4741520	A YouTube feature
4741520	4742520	That's not coming
4742520	4743520	Together correctly
4743520	4744520	No
4744520	4746520	Not my YouTube
4746520	4747520	Well
4747520	4748520	I'm pretty sure
4748520	4749520	YouTube has already
4749520	4751520	Been blocked in China
4751520	4752520	But now
4752520	4753520	Twitch can join them
4753520	4754520	In that circle
4754520	4755520	Twitch has been
4755520	4756520	Banned in China
4756520	4757520	That was some big news
4757520	4758520	That hit around the
4758520	4759520	Internet this week
4759520	4761520	This is because
4761520	4762520	I guess
4762520	4763520	Let's see
4763520	4764520	China took home
4764520	4765520	Two gold medals
4765520	4766520	In the Jakarta
4766520	4768520	Palembang 2018
4768520	4769520	Asian games
4769520	4770520	It's a pan Asian
4770520	4771520	Multisport tournament basically
4771520	4772520	So there's
4772520	4773520	There's many different
4773520	4774520	Games that are played
4774520	4775520	Amongst all these different countries
4775520	4776520	Think of it like the Olympics
4776520	4777520	But like eSports
4777520	4778520	Over in Asia
4778520	4779520	So China
4779520	4780520	You know made its mark
4780520	4781520	But unfortunately
4781520	4782520	CCTV did not broadcast
4782520	4783520	The event
4783520	4784520	So Chinese fans
4784520	4785520	Went to Twitch
4785520	4786520	So a huge spike
4786520	4787520	In downloads
4787520	4788520	For the streaming site
4788520	4789520	Now this pings it
4789520	4790520	On Twitch's radar
4790520	4791520	And now
4791520	4792520	Twitch's website
4792520	4793520	Is inaccessible
4793520	4794520	It's inaccessible
4794520	4795520	In China
4795520	4796520	You can't get it
4796520	4797520	On the iOS app store
4797520	4799520	And you know this
4799520	4800520	Many observers
4800520	4801520	And analysts saying
4801520	4804520	That this is kind of a regular thing
4804520	4805520	Western media platforms
4805520	4806520	That get very popular
4806520	4808520	End up getting blocked
4808520	4809520	Twitch has confirmed
4809520	4810520	They've been blocked
4810520	4811520	In China
4811520	4812520	But they don't have any other details
4812520	4813520	At this time
4813520	4814520	So in some ways
4814520	4815520	It's kind of a
4815520	4816520	You made it kid
4816520	4817520	And in other ways
4817520	4818520	It's a
4818520	4819520	Well that's a bummer
4819520	4820520	Because there were probably
4820520	4821520	Folks in China
4821520	4822520	That wanted to watch
4822520	4823520	But they can't
4823520	4824520	Because they were being streamed
4824520	4825520	On Twitch
4825520	4826520	And what
4826520	4827520	How does this affect
4827520	4828520	Overwatch League
4828520	4829520	I'm kind of curious
4829520	4830520	Because don't we have
4830520	4833520	An expansion team in China
4833520	4834520	And all those games
4834520	4836520	Were being broadcast on Twitch
4836520	4837520	Or do they go
4837520	4838520	Are they on a
4838520	4840520	Different platform in China
4840520	4841520	Maybe they are
4841520	4842520	I just may not be aware
4842520	4843520	That there may be a
4843520	4845520	China centric
4845520	4846520	Live streaming platform
4846520	4847520	That they use over there
4847520	4849520	So I'm kind of curious about that
4849520	4851520	So there you go
4851520	4852520	So there you go
4852520	4853520	So unfortunately
4853520	4854520	When we
4854520	4855520	Just finally make our move
4855520	4856520	To Twitch
4856520	4857520	Which is you know
4857520	4858520	Still on the radar
4858520	4859520	If these cable issues
4859520	4860520	Get fixed
4860520	4861520	We should be
4861520	4862520	Making our own move
4862520	4863520	To Twitch
4863520	4864520	Folks in China
4864520	4865520	Won't be able to see it
4865520	4866520	Live unfortunately
4866520	4867520	But I don't think
4867520	4868520	Anybody in China
4868520	4869520	Is listening live today
4869520	4870520	If you are
4870520	4871520	You should let us know
4871520	4872520	Because I would love
4872520	4873520	To hear from you
4873520	4874520	But remember
4874520	4875520	The podcast is not
4875520	4876520	Going to be changing at all
4876520	4877520	So if we have Chinese
4877520	4878520	Folks that listen
4878520	4879520	On the podcast
4879520	4880520	Well that will still
4880520	4881520	Be the same
4881520	4882520	Similar sort of set up
4882520	4883520	That you get it today
4883520	4884520	So
4884520	4885520	Act F says
4885520	4886520	I think Overwatch League games
4886520	4887520	Are also on
4887520	4889520	Major League gaming's website
4889520	4890520	Gotcha
4890520	4891520	I was going to say
4891520	4892520	There's got to be
4892520	4893520	Another option
4893520	4894520	Because that would be a bummer
4894520	4895520	To have this whole expansion team
4895520	4897520	For Overwatch League
4897520	4898520	And then
4898520	4899520	People in that city
4899520	4900520	Can't even watch it
4900520	4901520	Even though everybody
4901520	4902520	Is living in LA anyway
4902520	4903520	But oh well
4903520	4904520	Alright
4904520	4905520	Let's go back to
4905520	4906520	When things were simpler
4906520	4907520	Let's go back to a time
4907520	4908520	When we couldn't
4908520	4909520	Live stream games
4909520	4910520	You wanted to watch
4910520	4911520	We play a game
4911520	4912520	And you'd come over
4912520	4913520	And sit on the couch
4913520	4914520	Or we had to put
4914520	4915520	Our video camera
4915520	4916520	In front of our TV
4916520	4917520	To videotape
4917520	4918520	The high sports
4918520	4919520	And the VHS tape
4919520	4920520	That's right
4920520	4921520	Or when I was playing
4921520	4922520	Ultima Exodus
4922520	4923520	I would use
4923520	4924520	The sight spell
4924520	4925520	To get the map
4925520	4926520	For the dungeon
4926520	4927520	And I would record it
4927520	4928520	So I could refer
4928520	4929520	To it later
4929520	4930520	I used to draw my maps
4930520	4931520	My Zelda maps
4931520	4932520	Nice
4932520	4933520	Alright
4933520	4934520	On old food foods
4934520	4935520	So I had them
4935520	4936520	On denim
4936520	4937520	And rolled up this fold
4937520	4938520	It is the classic
4938520	4939520	Needed this week
4939520	4940520	Dark soccer is gonna
4940520	4941520	Climb into the gaming vault
4941520	4942520	And find a game or two
4942520	4943520	Which she thinks
4943520	4944520	Hey
4944520	4945520	You kids
4945520	4946520	Play this game
4946520	4947520	You don't need
4947520	4948520	No hundred dollar
4948520	4949520	Stinkin' PlayStation
4949520	4950520	Classic to play this
4950520	4951520	This is pre-rumble pack
4951520	4952520	N64 shit here
4952520	4953520	That's right
4953520	4954520	Here it is
4954520	4955520	Your classic game of the week
4955520	4956520	Dark soccer
4956520	4957520	What did you pick
4957520	4958520	For the classic game
4958520	4959520	Of the week this week?
4959520	4960520	I picked Chameleon Twist
4960520	4961520	Yay
4961520	4962520	Um
4962520	4963520	It is a pretty difficult game
4963520	4964520	It has a weird
4964520	4966520	Continue system
4966520	4967520	But it's treasure
4967520	4968520	Wait
4968520	4969520	No it's not
4969520	4970520	It's done soft
4970520	4971520	It's pre-treasure
4971520	4972520	Stuff
4972520	4973520	Anyway
4973520	4974520	Um
4974520	4975520	Chameleon Twist
4975520	4976520	Um
4976520	4977520	Is
4977520	4978520	We play as one of four
4978520	4979520	Chameleons
4979520	4980520	And you go over
4980520	4981520	Different worlds
4981520	4982520	Um
4982520	4983520	It has a very long
4983520	4984520	Tongue
4984520	4985520	To use as a weapon
4985520	4986520	And you can also use it
4986520	4988520	Kind of as a grappling hook
4988520	4989520	And you can use
4989520	4990520	The tongue
4990520	4991520	You basically
4991520	4992520	Move the tongue
4992520	4993520	On its own
4993520	4996520	With the analog stick
4996520	4997520	And you also have
4997520	4998520	Like a training area
4998520	4999520	That you can learn
4999520	5000520	How to master
5000520	5001520	The tongue
5001520	5002520	Um
5002520	5004520	So you have to go through
5004520	5005520	Different indoor environments
5005520	5007520	You have a boss battle
5007520	5008520	And then you have to keep
5008520	5009520	Collecting hearts to
5009520	5010520	Replenish your
5010520	5011520	Uh
5011520	5012520	Your health
5012520	5013520	And you play as
5013520	5014520	A chameleon
5014520	5015520	Called
5015520	5016520	Davy
5016520	5017520	And he follows
5017520	5018520	A white rabbit
5018520	5019520	Into a magical ground
5019520	5020520	In the hole
5020520	5021520	And he becomes
5021520	5022520	A humanoid
5022520	5023520	In Wonderland
5023520	5024520	His friends are
5024520	5025520	Jack, Fred, and Linda
5025520	5026520	White people names
5026520	5027520	I don't
5027520	5028520	Like seriously
5028520	5029520	Um
5029520	5030520	No
5030520	5031520	I would say
5031520	5032520	Probably like
5032520	5033520	Caitlin's
5033520	5034520	But spelled differently
5034520	5035520	Anyway
5035520	5036520	Um
5036520	5037520	So with the
5037520	5038520	B button
5038520	5039520	You stick out
5039520	5040520	Your tongue
5040520	5041520	By the way
5041520	5042520	This was on
5042520	5043520	Nintendo 64
5043520	5044520	And then you move
5044520	5045520	The tongue around
5045520	5046520	With the analog stick
5046520	5047520	Which controls
5047520	5048520	You know
5048520	5049520	The movement there
5049520	5050520	So you can use that
5050520	5051520	To get power ups
5051520	5052520	At a distance
5052520	5053520	Or just swallow
5053520	5054520	Enemies
5054520	5055520	And it will retract
5055520	5056520	Back
5056520	5057520	Or until it bumps
5057520	5058520	A wall
5058520	5059520	Which will also
5059520	5060520	Make it back
5060520	5061520	Uh
5061520	5062520	Go back
5062520	5063520	So it is just
5063520	5064520	A standard
5064520	5065520	You know
5065520	5066520	Tongue thing
5066520	5067520	When they swallow
5067520	5068520	The enemies
5068520	5069520	But you have the option
5069520	5070520	Of spitting the
5070520	5071520	Enemy back out
5071520	5072520	Um
5072520	5073520	At the other enemies
5073520	5074520	Kind of
5074520	5075520	You know
5075520	5076520	Uh
5076520	5077520	Roshi
5077520	5078520	Or Kirby style
5078520	5079520	I mean
5079520	5080520	Except Kirby
5080520	5081520	Actually spits out
5081520	5082520	All your cute stars
5082520	5083520	Um
5083520	5084520	You know
5084520	5085520	You can launch
5085520	5086520	Into the air
5086520	5087520	By using your tongue
5087520	5088520	Um
5088520	5089520	You get
5089520	5090520	Like
5090520	5091520	Pretty much
5091520	5092520	Tongue vaulting
5092520	5093520	Tongue pull vaulting
5093520	5094520	Um
5094520	5095520	So you actually
5095520	5096520	Can use a pull
5096520	5097520	Um
5097520	5098520	With the tongue
5098520	5099520	As a grapple
5099520	5100520	And swing yourself
5100520	5101520	Across
5101520	5102520	You also have
5102520	5103520	Multi player mode
5103520	5104520	Which is two to four players
5104520	5105520	That has a battle royale
5105520	5106520	Or a time trial
5106520	5107520	Where um
5107520	5108520	You have to be
5108520	5109520	The last chameleon
5109520	5110520	Standing on the platform
5110520	5111520	For battle royale
5111520	5112520	Um
5112520	5113520	For the time trial
5113520	5114520	Um
5114520	5115520	You have to stay
5115520	5116520	On the platform
5116520	5117520	The longest
5117520	5118520	And that's
5118520	5119520	Really
5119520	5120520	It
5120520	5121520	Came out in 1997
5121520	5122520	That was a while ago
5122520	5124520	God damn these fucking ads
5124520	5125520	Ad block Rob
5125520	5126520	Ad block
5126520	5127520	I thought I had it
5127520	5128520	On this computer
5128520	5130520	It's just time to upgrade
5130520	5131520	YouTube
5131520	5132520	Uh
5132520	5133520	It's time to upgrade
5133520	5134520	A lot
5134520	5135520	But that's it
5135520	5136520	It's Chameleon Twist
5136520	5137520	I don't know why I had it
5137520	5138520	In my brain
5138520	5139520	This was a treasure game
5139520	5140520	Well
5140520	5141520	It is a treasure
5141520	5142520	Of a different sort
5142520	5143520	There it is
5143520	5144520	Poopy treasure
5144520	5145520	Your classic game of the week

5153520	5154520	In a little while
5154520	5155520	Cause we've had magic
5155520	5156520	To hold us over
5156520	5157520	We're gonna take a break
5157520	5158520	Rob Cluffy

5193520	5194520	For tonight
5194520	5196520	September 23rd of 2018
5196520	5197520	Dark Sakura joining us
5197520	5198520	In studio
5198520	5199520	Who has um
5199520	5200520	Not been able to be here
5200520	5201520	At the show live
5201520	5202520	For about a month
5202520	5203520	And unfortunately
5203520	5204520	Probably for a couple
5204520	5205520	More months
5205520	5206520	But able to visit
5206520	5207520	Like once a month
5207520	5208520	Yeah and I'm
5208520	5209520	Because of work
5209520	5210520	Yeah because of work
5210520	5211520	I'm trying to
5211520	5212520	Get things together
5212520	5213520	You know
5213520	5214520	But I will say
5214520	5215520	Speaking of work
5215520	5216520	I know I don't
5216520	5217520	Want to get into
5217520	5218520	Too many details
5218520	5219520	Cause isn't anyone's business
5219520	5220520	What you do during the day
5220520	5221520	But I did hear
5221520	5222520	You got like a promotion
5222520	5223520	You were going for at work
5223520	5224520	So
5224520	5225520	I'll put it this way
5225520	5226520	Big ups on that
5226520	5227520	Congrats
5227520	5228520	It was actually
5228520	5229520	It was the first job
5229520	5231520	I applied and interviewed for
5231520	5232520	Was in this position
5232520	5234520	And it wasn't the one I got
5234520	5235520	Because I think they were
5235520	5236520	Opening it for other temps
5236520	5237520	At the time
5237520	5239520	But I have
5239520	5240520	Gone up through the ranks
5240520	5241520	As high as I could go
5241520	5242520	In one direction
5242520	5243520	And I finally am in the
5243520	5244520	Department I wanted to be in
5244520	5245520	So
5245520	5246520	So as much as it sucks
5246520	5247520	That you can't always be here
5247520	5248520	On Sundays
5248520	5249520	This is a good thing for your
5249520	5250520	You know
5250520	5251520	And I got a raise out of it
5251520	5252520	So
5252520	5253520	Yeah so for your
5253520	5254520	So as much as it sucks
5254520	5255520	For you not being here
5255520	5256520	The reality is
5256520	5257520	You know
5257520	5258520	You're part of what you got to
5258520	5259520	Do to make that happen
5259520	5260520	So
5260520	5261520	I just want to give you
5261520	5262520	Congratulations
5262520	5263520	I'm sure all the listeners are
5263520	5264520	Going to say the same type of
5264520	5265520	Thing in chat
5265520	5266520	Because y'all rock here at
5266520	5267520	Orange Lawn Radio
5267520	5268520	It's appreciated
5268520	5269520	And I'm happy to do my radio
5269520	5270520	Magic you know
5270520	5271520	Yeah
5271520	5272520	Come over and visit
5272520	5273520	And do what I can to make
5273520	5274520	Make sure y'all don't forget
5274520	5275520	About me
5275520	5276520	We would
5276520	5277520	We could never
5277520	5278520	We would never
5278520	5279520	You could
5279520	5280520	You need to do more streaming
5280520	5281520	And that type of stuff
5281520	5282520	To keep us remembering
5282520	5283520	Who you are
5283520	5284520	Actually
5284520	5285520	To get me back to doing
5285520	5286520	More World of Warcraft
5286520	5287520	And you know
5287520	5288520	Cussing at people
5288520	5289520	I cuss at the characters
5289520	5291520	In the game Rob
5291520	5292520	I tell them that they're
5292520	5293520	Shitholes
5293520	5294520	You kind of should
5294520	5295520	Like Sylvanas is totally a bitch
5295520	5296520	Now
5296520	5297520	Like what happened
5297520	5298520	Like
5298520	5299520	And I'm not just saying
5299520	5300520	I'm not saying that because
5300520	5301520	It's the cheap shot
5301520	5302520	Because she's a woman
5302520	5303520	And anything
5303520	5304520	She is a bitch
5304520	5305520	She has turned into full on
5305520	5306520	Cunt monster
5306520	5307520	Okay you said it
5307520	5308520	I didn't
5308520	5309520	No I'm like
5309520	5310520	They're ruining her
5310520	5311520	They're ruining her
5311520	5312520	They are
5312520	5313520	I used to like her
5313520	5314520	And now she's like
5314520	5315520	Why are you such a bitch
5315520	5317520	Like what crawled up your mall
5317520	5318520	And died
5318520	5319520	You know
5319520	5320520	Oh yeah
5320520	5321520	She's already dead inside
5321520	5322520	You know what I still think
5322520	5323520	That it would serve her right
5323520	5324520	If they made her alive again
5324520	5326520	Like for the final thing
5326520	5327520	I've
5327520	5329520	I've heard fan wank theories
5329520	5330520	Nothing official obviously
5330520	5331520	Blizzard's keeping that under wraps
5331520	5333520	But fan wank theory
5333520	5336520	Seems to think that's how this ends
5336520	5338520	Like it would be a much fitting
5338520	5340520	End for her
5340520	5342520	As opposed to what happened to Garrosh
5342520	5343520	Yeah
5343520	5344520	So it'd be interesting
5344520	5345520	To get in that direction
5345520	5346520	So
5346520	5349520	And they've done all these books
5349520	5350520	Like with her and her sisters
5350520	5351520	Getting back together
5351520	5352520	In different books
5352520	5353520	And everything
5353520	5354520	So
5354520	5356520	But I'm still doing the Argus content
5356520	5358520	Because I want to make a void elf
5358520	5360520	Although I will probably still play
5360520	5362520	My demon hunty
5362520	5364520	Because demon hunters fun
5364520	5365520	Yeah
5365520	5366520	I kind of miss my
5366520	5367520	My monk
5367520	5368520	My tauren monk
5368520	5369520	But my monk
5369520	5370520	I have a pandaren
5370520	5371520	My one bitch about
5371520	5372520	Well I'll say this
5372520	5373520	Then we'll get back into some
5373520	5374520	My one bitch about
5374520	5375520	Wow
5375520	5376520	I do not like how they
5376520	5377520	Locked those races
5377520	5378520	Behind these dumb achievements
5378520	5380520	In the last expansion
5380520	5381520	That you have to
5381520	5382520	That's stupid
5382520	5383520	I'm sorry
5383520	5384520	I'm glad I got my
5384520	5385520	My
5385520	5386520	What the fuck elf
5386520	5387520	Nightfallen
5387520	5388520	Uh huh
5388520	5389520	When I did
5389520	5390520	Before they put it behind
5390520	5391520	Well actually no
5391520	5392520	I was already
5392520	5393520	I already had
5393520	5394520	Elevated?
5394520	5395520	Exalted
5395520	5396520	With
5396520	5397520	With the
5397520	5398520	With that faction anyway
5398520	5399520	So maybe that's why I got it
5399520	5400520	I don't know
5400520	5401520	I just don't like it
5401520	5402520	It's dumb
5402520	5403520	It's stupid
5403520	5404520	Alright
5404520	5405520	How dare they
5405520	5406520	You know what's awesome
5406520	5407520	Some more gaming news
5407520	5408520	Rapid fire news
5408520	5409520	Starting off with Loki
5409520	5410520	Yes let's talk about
5410520	5412520	One of my favorite franchises
5412520	5414520	Earth Defense Force
5414520	5415520	Right around the corner
5415520	5417520	Earth Defense Force 5
5417520	5419520	Another game where you'll be
5419520	5421520	Shooting giant bugs
5421520	5422520	And they don't really change
5422520	5423520	A whole lot each game
5423520	5424520	But
5424520	5425520	It's a new one
5425520	5426520	And it's coming out
5426520	5427520	December 11th
5427520	5428520	Right around the corner
5428520	5429520	On Playstation 4
5429520	5431520	Hopefully PC at some point soon
5431520	5433520	I'll have to pick it up
5433520	5434520	Because I do
5434520	5435520	Because it's Earth Defense Force
5435520	5436520	And it's you
5436520	5437520	Of course you're gonna pick it up
5437520	5438520	It's Earth Defense Force
5438520	5439520	And it's like the same
5439520	5440520	Like when I talk about
5440520	5441520	Roster update man
5441520	5442520	That game is just like
5442520	5443520	It's the same shit
5443520	5444520	All the time
5444520	5446520	But I'm down
5446520	5447520	I'll bite you
5447520	5449520	You're gonna eat that shit up
5449520	5450520	With a spoon
5450520	5451520	And there's nothing wrong with that
5451520	5452520	Yes I will
5452520	5453520	I will do that
5453520	5454520	There is a rumor
5454520	5455520	That there is a possible
5455520	5456520	Leaked
5456520	5458520	Character from Smash Brothers Ultimate
5458520	5459520	Of course
5459520	5460520	Oh it must be a day
5460520	5461520	Ending in Y
5461520	5462520	On some web forum
5462520	5463520	Of course
5463520	5464520	Remember that
5464520	5465520	There are a lot of
5465520	5466520	Faked screenshots
5466520	5467520	So take this
5467520	5469520	With a grain of salt
5469520	5471520	But the picture shows Ken
5471520	5473520	Of Street Fighter 2
5473520	5474520	It could see that
5474520	5475520	Being like an echo fighter
5475520	5476520	For Ryu or something like that
5476520	5477520	But
5477520	5478520	That is a very obvious
5478520	5479520	Sort of echo character
5479520	5480520	But
5480520	5481520	It could also be
5481520	5482520	Incredibly bullshit
5482520	5483520	Fakes
5483520	5484520	So
5484520	5485520	Keep that in mind as well
5485520	5486520	But it is something that
5486520	5487520	I can see
5487520	5488520	Where they pad the roster
5488520	5489520	With that
5489520	5490520	So
5490520	5491520	Yeah
5491520	5492520	Don't be surprised
5492520	5493520	If that's an announcement
5493520	5494520	But don't be not surprised
5494520	5495520	If it's completely fake
5495520	5496520	Because
5496520	5497520	You know
5497520	5498520	A perfect
5498520	5499520	Perfect way to say that there
5499520	5500520	Don't be surprised
5500520	5501520	If it happens
5501520	5502520	But you know what
5502520	5503520	Don't be surprised
5503520	5504520	If it doesn't happen
5504520	5506520	Just don't be surprised
5506520	5507520	It's the internet y'all
5507520	5508520	Darktotu in chat
5508520	5509520	Over at Live.com
5509520	5510520	And I'll see you
5510520	5511520	In the next one
5511520	5512520	Bye
5512520	5513520	Bye
5513520	5514520	Darktotu in chat
5514520	5515520	Over at Live.vognetwork.com
5515520	5516520	Says
5516520	5517520	I want to believe Ken
5517520	5518520	Is really in the game
5518520	5519520	But yeah
5519520	5520520	I'm trying hard
5520520	5521520	Not to fall for this
5521520	5522520	I mean
5522520	5523520	It's
5523520	5524520	It does make a lot of sense
5524520	5525520	They just
5525520	5526520	They don't really have to give
5526520	5527520	Him anything special
5527520	5528520	It would just be a different look
5528520	5529520	Just an echo fighter
5529520	5530520	Yeah
5530520	5531520	Just an echo fighter
5531520	5532520	Alright
5532520	5533520	We'll see
5533520	5534520	Anyway
5534520	5535520	Moving on with some more
5535520	5536520	Rapid fire news
5536520	5537520	This is certainly deserving
5537520	5538520	Of a
5538520	5539520	Of a longer story slot
5539520	5540520	But there isn't a lot
5540520	5541520	To say on this
5541520	5542520	Nobuo Imatsu
5542520	5543520	He did every Final Fantasy
5543520	5544520	Soundtrack pre-11
5544520	5545520	He's done a lot of this stuff
5545520	5546520	Since then too
5546520	5548520	He did music for Chrono Trigger
5548520	5549520	You know
5549520	5550520	Lots of great RPGs
5550520	5551520	He can probably think of
5551520	5553520	He is ceasing his current work
5553520	5555520	Due to health problems
5555520	5556520	He hasn't said what the health problem was
5556520	5558520	But he did say on his blog
5558520	5559520	In a post that he made
5559520	5560520	He's been affected by
5560520	5562520	A unnamed disease
5562520	5563520	For a few years
5563520	5564520	And it's now at a point
5564520	5565520	Where he is unable to act
5565520	5567520	At full capacity
5567520	5569520	So he's taking time to rest
5569520	5570520	And considering if he's
5570520	5571520	Gonna be able to do
5571520	5573520	Any future projects at all
5573520	5574520	Again we don't know
5574520	5575520	What the illness is
5575520	5576520	I'm not going to speculate here
5576520	5577520	Certainly many people are
5577520	5578520	You know
5578520	5579520	Inventing the scenarios
5579520	5580520	In their head
5580520	5581520	I'm just gonna hope
5581520	5582520	That he gets better
5582520	5583520	This
5583520	5584520	This is a decision
5584520	5585520	He's come to with his doctors
5585520	5586520	That if he's
5586520	5587520	It takes a break from work
5587520	5588520	And the stress
5588520	5589520	That comes with it
5589520	5590520	For a little while
5590520	5591520	It's gonna help him get better
5591520	5592520	I'm really really gonna hope
5592520	5593520	That that is the case
5593520	5594520	Cause Nobuo Imatsu
5594520	5595520	He's not
5595520	5596520	He's in his 50's
5596520	5597520	His late 50's
5597520	5598520	Not an old guy
5598520	5599520	So it's just
5599520	5600520	Yeah
5600520	5601520	You know
5601520	5602520	Sending well wishes
5602520	5603520	And thoughts
5603520	5604520	And you know
5604520	5605520	Healing vibes
5605520	5606520	His way
5606520	5607520	And you know
5607520	5608520	Obviously his impact
5608520	5609520	To games
5609520	5610520	Has been extraordinary
5610520	5611520	But if he needs to take a break
5611520	5612520	He's fucking earned it
5612520	5615520	So let's give him his privacy
5615520	5617520	Moving on to Tetris Effect
5617520	5618520	Which Dark Soccer brought up
5618520	5619520	A little bit earlier
5619520	5620520	But I'll kind of
5620520	5621520	Finish the thought here
5621520	5622520	Because not only did
5622520	5623520	We get to see that
5623520	5624520	At the Tokyo Game Show
5624520	5625520	We got a date
5625520	5626520	For that game
5626520	5627520	November 9th
5627520	5628520	Is when you can all start
5628520	5629520	Feeling Tetris Effect
5629520	5630520	So I'll finally be in my
5630520	5631520	PlayStation VR
5631520	5632520	By November 9th
5632520	5633520	Go play Rez
5633520	5634520	Come on
5634520	5635520	And I need to play this
5635520	5636520	I understand that you have
5636520	5637520	Like space issues in your room
5637520	5638520	But here's the best part
5638520	5639520	About it
5639520	5640520	The camera
5640520	5641520	Doesn't have to be on top
5641520	5642520	Of the TV
5642520	5643520	You can face it and complete
5643520	5644520	Oh that's good
5644520	5645520	I played VR in my kitchen
5645520	5647520	Without a TV even hooked up
5647520	5648520	Alright that's good to know
5648520	5649520	It's good to know
5649520	5650520	But anyway of course
5650520	5651520	You know
5651520	5652520	Everything else we've heard
5652520	5653520	About Tetris
5653520	5654520	Nothing else has changed
5654520	5655520	That zone mechanic
5655520	5656520	Where you can freeze time
5656520	5657520	And kind of build up
5657520	5658520	Your Tetris clears and stuff

5661520	5662520	That is the big day for that
5662520	5663520	DarkSakura
5663520	5664520	You've got a couple of things
5664520	5665520	For us
5665520	5666520	I do
5666520	5667520	There has been something
5667520	5669520	Sent to the Game Rating
5669520	5671520	And Admission

5683520	5684520	From Konami out here
5684520	5686520	But I mean that would simply be
5686520	5687520	Not turn in the moonlight
5687520	5688520	And Rondo of Blood
5688520	5689520	So yay

5828520	5829520	not surprised
5830520	5831520	Alright
5831520	5832520	Welcome to Japan
5832520	5833520	and looking at some of the releases there
5833520	5834520	on the PlayStation 4
5834520	5836520	on September the 27th
5836520	5839520	Iyudensetsu Senokisuke 4
5839520	5841520	The End of Saga
5841520	5842520	from Falcom
5842520	5843520	comes out
5843520	5844520	on again
5844520	5846520	September the 27th
5846520	5847520	is when that is out
5847520	5849520	and this game looks like
5849520	5850520	I'm trying to think if it's something that's
5850520	5851520	localized here
5851520	5852520	but I don't think it is
5852520	5853520	Legend Heroes?
5853520	5854520	Maybe?
5854520	5855520	Something like that?
5855520	5856520	I don't know
5856520	5857520	This game
5857520	5858520	What's it called?
5858520	5859520	Iyudensetsu Senokisuke 4
5859520	5860520	The End of Saga
5862520	5863520	I don't know
5863520	5864520	Legend Heroes?
5864520	5865520	Might be?
5865520	5866520	Anyway
5866520	5867520	That is coming out
5867520	5868520	That seems to be kind of the big
5868520	5869520	Legend of Heroes is what
5869520	5871520	Dr. Tetsuya thinks it is
5871520	5873520	Utaware Urumono Zan
5873520	5875520	comes out also as well this week in Japan
5875520	5877520	Musou Orochi 3
5877520	5878520	out this week as well
5878520	5879520	and that same
5879520	5881520	Utaware Urumono Zan
5881520	5884520	has a premium edition with that as well
5884520	5887520	So Super Neptunia RPG
5887520	5888520	is this week
5888520	5889520	as well as
5889520	5890520	a
5890520	5892520	Eternal Preservation edition of the
5892520	5894520	Iyudensetsu game I talked about just a moment ago
5894520	5896520	Taiyutama 2
5896520	5897520	You're the Only One
5897520	5898520	is out this week
5898520	5900520	as well as Warriors Orochi 4
5900520	5901520	in regular and
5901520	5902520	limited edition

5903520	5905520	a collector's edition on that as well
5905520	5907520	Assetto Corsa is out
5907520	5909520	as well as MotoGP 18
5909520	5911520	Kind of a busy week there in Japan
5911520	5913520	Taking a look at the Nintendo Switch real fast
5913520	5915520	to see if we're getting anything there
5915520	5916520	Oh yes
5916520	5917520	The World Ends With You Final Remix

5918520	5920520	That is out in Japan this week on the Switch
5920520	5922520	Senju no Valkyria 4
5922520	5924520	which I imagine is Valkyria Chronicles 4
5924520	5926520	also out this week on the Switch in Japan
5926520	5928520	That's Super Neptunia RPG
5928520	5929520	also out this week
5929520	5930520	and
5930520	5932520	Warriors Orochi 4

5997520	5999520	head off to the mailbag
5999520	6001520	Every week you guys email us
6001520	6003520	participate at
6004520	6006520	and we read your emails here live on air
6006520	6008520	as long as you keep them classy
6008520	6010520	appropriate and all that
6010520	6012520	and we're gonna get into the mailbag this week
6012520	6014520	so let's do it
6014520	6015520	Dark Sakura's here
6015520	6016520	So she should read the emails again
6016520	6017520	I've been doing it lately
6017520	6019520	but I think Dark Sakura should get back to reading emails
6019520	6020520	What do you think Dark Sakura?
6020520	6022520	Sure
6022520	6024520	So this comes from Ryan
6025520	6028520	Hey O.L.R. while hanging out in the VOG Network Discord
6028520	6030520	which you can also participate in at
6030520	6032520	vognetwork.com slash discord
6032520	6034520	Brilliant plug
6034520	6036520	Thank Ryan
6036520	6038520	I noticed that Alan plays a bit of Dark Souls
6038520	6040520	whether a newbie or a seasoned player
6040520	6042520	I'm curious to hear about his experiences with the game
6042520	6044520	or if he had any cool stories to share
6044520	6046520	Love the show, Ryan
6046520	6048520	Alan was not in here to hear this message
6048520	6050520	No, Alan was not in here to hear this message
6050520	6052520	I will fix that here shortly
6052520	6054520	I'll get him in here, see if he's available
6054520	6056520	if he's not in the middle of an Overwatch match
6056520	6058520	Do we have another email?
6058520	6060520	Why don't you read that one while I work on Alan
6060520	6062520	Okay
6062520	6064520	Last episode you were discussing the face
6064520	6066520	of each company and couldn't come with
6066520	6068520	one for Sony other than Kazurai
6068520	6070520	who left Playstation inside of the company
6070520	6072520	in 2012
6072520	6074520	Here are a few guys you couldn't think of
6074520	6076520	Andrew House, Adam Boyz, and Shuhei Yoshida
6076520	6078520	The former two were no longer with the company
6078520	6080520	but were arguably the faces for a while
6080520	6082520	as they were the ones who show up at PSX
6082520	6084520	or E3 every stage
6084520	6086520	up until they left last year
6086520	6088520	Shuhei is the current president
6088520	6090520	of Sony Worldwide Studios, i.e. the person
6090520	6092520	who oversees each of their first-party studios
6092520	6094520	and also gets a share of stage appearances
6094520	6096520	Perhaps the fact you couldn't think of them
6096520	6098520	lends credence to the idea that Sony
6098520	6100520	doesn't have a strong face
6100520	6102520	as Iwata or Miyamoto or Reggie
6102520	6104520	but when you think of someone of the well-known
6104520	6106520	Playstation clips, it's usually those people
6106520	6108520	Like, here's how you share games with a friend
6108520	6110520	on a PS4 dig at Microsoft
6110520	6112520	with Shuhei and Adam in the video
6112520	6114520	Shu does get mobbed at E3 and PSX
6114520	6116520	for pictures, so he's certainly well-known
6116520	6118520	among some groups, and much like Stan Lee
6118520	6120520	who was the kickoff for the topic
6120520	6122520	Shu has had cameos
6122520	6124520	in a bunch of other video games
6124520	6126520	Oddly enough, not usually first-party
6126520	6128520	but indie games like Super Time
6128520	6130520	Force Ultra, Everything, and Velocity
6130520	6132520	have used him or his likeness
6132520	6134520	and this comes from
6134520	6136520	Andrew, that's all I'm gonna say
6136520	6138520	I don't have a nickname on it
6138520	6140520	Probably the closest thing
6140520	6142520	to a mascot or whatever
6142520	6144520	Shu is mentioned in that
6144520	6146520	but I
6146520	6148520	still don't know if even that is
6148520	6150520	on that same level as something like Miyamoto
6150520	6152520	or Reggie Fils-May
6152520	6154520	or has that social media presence
6154520	6156520	that Major Nelson has on Twitter for Microsoft
6156520	6158520	or some of that. I still don't feel
6158520	6160520	like it's quite at the same level
6160520	6162520	You know what I mean? I don't know
6162520	6164520	I appreciate their perspective
6164520	6166520	I kind of get where you're going
6166520	6168520	some of these guys are really recognized in some circles
6168520	6170520	but I don't know if they're
6170520	6172520	the face on that same level
6172520	6174520	but I should have thought of at least
6174520	6176520	one of those last week. Anyway
6176520	6178520	I want to go back to the previous email
6178520	6180520	I actually made him die on a boss
6180520	6182520	so he could answer this question
6182520	6184520	Hi Alan!
6184520	6186520	Dark Souls
6186520	6188520	because they're on the Discord servers
6188520	6190520	they can see that you're playing Dark Souls
6190520	6192520	all the time. So tell us a little bit about
6192520	6194520	playing Dark Souls and your experience with that
6194520	6196520	or if you have cool stories
6196520	6198520	Just the remastered is out
6198520	6200520	and I've moved on to Dark Souls 2
6200520	6202520	because I finally got burned out on the remaster
6202520	6204520	just these last couple of days
6204520	6206520	just the versatility of creating a build
6206520	6208520	like having a strength character that wields
6208520	6210520	like a giant
6210520	6212520	basically like a tree
6212520	6214520	like an uprooted tree that's just like wham
6214520	6216520	like bam bam from the Flintstones
6216520	6218520	or like a Dex character
6218520	6220520	or like a caster
6220520	6222520	all the different types of weapons
6222520	6224520	it's a really
6224520	6226520	there's a lot of stuff under the surface
6226520	6228520	aside from jest, it's really hard
6228520	6230520	and then of course a lot of it's
6230520	6232520	muscle memory so when you
6232520	6234520	beat it
6234520	6236520	the incentive is there to do
6236520	6238520	the new game plus stuff because
6238520	6240520	you're going to have a way more
6240520	6242520	fun time your second and third time through
6242520	6244520	because you know how to
6244520	6246520	get through everything
6246520	6248520	Now you're
6248520	6250520	playing so much Dark Souls
6250520	6252520	you've actually accomplished the rare accomplishment
6252520	6254520	of getting what is essential
6254520	6256520	I mean you're playing it on PC not Playstation 4
6256520	6258520	but you're getting basically the equivalent of the platinum trophy
6258520	6260520	you've gotten every single achievement in Dark Souls right?
6260520	6262520	Yeah the remaster yes
6262520	6264520	Wow that's pretty crazy
6264520	6266520	Why do you think this is the game that you want to
6266520	6268520	and you guys don't live with him
6268520	6270520	but I do, he plays this game, it's like this and Overwatch
6270520	6272520	if he's playing something that's not this or Overwatch
6272520	6274520	I'm like what the hell's going on, you okay?
6274520	6276520	What is it
6276520	6278520	Why this game is what you're into right now?
6280520	6282520	And I'm not asking that in an accusing way I'm just curious
6282520	6284520	what is driving the passion for that?
6284520	6286520	I sort of just have a really addictive
6286520	6288520	personality so when a game catches my attention
6288520	6290520	I play to the exclusion of all else for three
6290520	6292520	or four months and then I move on
6292520	6294520	to something else I'll probably end up
6294520	6296520	playing Mass Effect again or Skyrim
6296520	6298520	at some point and you'll be like if you see Skyrim
6298520	6300520	you're going to see nothing but Skyrim for about three or four months
6300520	6302520	and then I'll move on to something else
6302520	6304520	so it's just whatever
6304520	6306520	You play a game, you play a game
6306520	6308520	Yes, until I am absolutely sick of it
6308520	6310520	so it's kind of like
6310520	6312520	you know
6312520	6314520	my Steam library
6314520	6316520	has 300 games that I have only beaten
6316520	6318520	like 20 of them and I just play those same 20 games
6318520	6320520	over and over and over again
6320520	6322520	like Dragon Age Origins and I can't
6322520	6324520	speedrun that game, if I do another
6324520	6326520	Origins career it's probably about a 60 or 70
6326520	6328520	hour commitment
6328520	6330520	Now you've played Dark Souls 2 as well right?
6330520	6332520	Yes. But not really 3? Correct.
6332520	6334520	Why? Just
6334520	6336520	it's
6336520	6338520	it's the one I know the least
6338520	6340520	and I have fear of the unknown
6340520	6342520	because I can play the other two
6342520	6344520	inside and out so I'm like okay here's how I get
6344520	6346520	this really
6346520	6348520	incredible weapon that makes me overpowered
6348520	6350520	at a really early level. You weren't always that way right?
6350520	6352520	True, but you just
6352520	6354520	I don't know, I just watch
6354520	6356520	Let's Plays of YouTubes of like here's how to
6356520	6358520	become a hex caster
6358520	6360520	by level 10 and it's like
6360520	6362520	alright so I just need to do that
6362520	6364520	for Dark Souls 3. Alright so maybe
6364520	6366520	maybe in the next 3 or 4 months we'll see
6366520	6368520	Dark Souls 3. Yes. Alright.
6368520	6370520	I think you've satisfactorily answered the email
6370520	6372520	Thank you Alan, round of applause for Alan
6372520	6374520	Thank you. It says something that
6374520	6376520	he's quite the spouse
6376520	6378520	that I can pull him from whatever he's doing to make him
6378520	6380520	answer a listener email so there you go
6380520	6382520	Alright were there any more emails?
6382520	6384520	Yeah there was one more. Okay. Kind of a long one.
6384520	6386520	Okay. Hey all, thanks for
6386520	6388520	promoting, this is from Placo Jones by the way
6388520	6390520	Thanks for promoting my Twitch channel
6390520	6392520	on the show last week. I was wondering what your
6392520	6394520	thoughts were about the issues of Nintendo cloud saves
6394520	6396520	not working for all games. They're really
6396520	6398520	plugging this feature in the build up to the reveal
6398520	6400520	of their paid online service. But
6400520	6402520	just before launch they announced that it won't work
6402520	6404520	for some games including arguably their best online
6404520	6406520	title Splatoon 2
6406520	6408520	There's still no way to back up your saves for
6408520	6410520	Splatoon 2 and whichever other
6410520	6412520	online titles they won't allow cloud saves
6412520	6414520	for. So if your Switch breaks or
6414520	6416520	gets stolen you lose all that data which for me is
6416520	6418520	nearly 99 levels in Splatoon 2
6418520	6420520	as well as my gear gold snail
6420520	6422520	etc.
6422520	6424520	They claim to be doing this because people
6424520	6426520	could use cloud saves to cheat. For example
6426520	6428520	lose a ranked match that you
6428520	6430520	that would rank you down. Just reload an old save
6430520	6432520	from the cloud before that match.
6432520	6434520	That type of cheating or save
6434520	6436520	scumming did run rampant in Splatoon
6436520	6438520	1 but in my opinion isn't really a game
6438520	6440520	breaking cheat since it only affects that players
6440520	6442520	rank or some minor gear
6442520	6444520	update, upgrade rules or whatever else
6444520	6446520	save scumming could be used for. Usually pretty
6446520	6448520	minor stuff. Meanwhile
6448520	6450520	cheaters are everywhere in Splatoon 2 because
6450520	6452520	if you hack your Switch it's very easy
6452520	6454520	to tweak anything from your rank to your
6454520	6456520	weapons abilities to even the maps you
6456520	6458520	can load onto. So why would cheaters bother
6458520	6460520	save scumming when they can already
6460520	6462520	cheat in far more effective and game breaking
6462520	6464520	ways by hacking. And Nintendo
6464520	6466520	has no anti-cheat installed to stop these players.
6466520	6468520	They only go off reports from other players
6468520	6470520	so a smart cheater would just tweak themselves
6470520	6472520	to be powerful enough to
6472520	6474520	dominate matches but not so much that it raises
6474520	6476520	other players suspicions. Ironically
6476520	6478520	enough I'm considering hacking my Switch
6478520	6480520	since only then would I be able to
6480520	6482520	create a backup save because Nintendo
6482520	6484520	won't put a little extra work
6484520	6486520	to do what online games like Overwatch
6486520	6488520	already do which is just save your account data
6488520	6490520	on their own server instead of pulling it from
6490520	6492520	your console. Anyway
6492520	6494520	that's my rant on the subject. I'm overall very
6494520	6496520	unimpressed with the implementation of
6496520	6498520	Nintendo's paid online service
6498520	6500520	but that's a whole other topic. Thanks for the
6500520	6502520	great show. Can't wait for your move to
6502520	6504520	Twitch. Falco Jones. Yeah I just
6504520	6506520	you know because I remembered oh yeah I downloaded
6506520	6508520	the Nintendo app. Their online
6508520	6510520	app. Let's see what I'm paying for here.
6510520	6512520	Voice chat. Game specific
6512520	6514520	services. Splatoon 2.
6514520	6516520	I don't own Splatoon 2.
6516520	6518520	That's no fucking
6518520	6520520	use to me.
6520520	6522520	Some comments in chat over at
6522520	6524520	live.vognetwork.com. Bobby Blackwolf
6524520	6526520	our pal also on the network here says
6526520	6528520	they designed their online system terribly
6528520	6530520	and are trying to cover it up. They shouldn't
6530520	6532520	store your online data on your local system
6532520	6534520	they should store it 100% on their servers.
6534520	6536520	Exactly. There's a couple people jumping
6536520	6538520	in going yes this.
6538520	6540520	And that wouldn't be that hard to fix either
6540520	6542520	patch the shit. You can
6542520	6544520	patch your games now Nintendo.
6544520	6546520	Start storing it on the server
6546520	6548520	and then just
6548520	6550520	don't store it locally anymore and then you can do
6550520	6552520	the backups. This online thing really
6552520	6554520	has some of the you know I consider
6554520	6556520	Falco to have always been somebody who's you know been pretty
6556520	6558520	pretty quick to defend Nintendo and appreciate
6558520	6560520	Nintendo and you know
6560520	6562520	it's not just him but I'm picking on him because
6562520	6564520	of the email at the moment but I feel like a lot of
6564520	6566520	Nintendo fans out there like this online
6566520	6568520	thing even the most
6568520	6570520	heavy Nintendo fans
6570520	6572520	are having a hard time like sticking up for it
6572520	6574520	and even saying Nintendo has been making some
6574520	6576520	pretty shitty decisions with this thing. Like I get
6576520	6578520	the fence with them like oh we're not
6578520	6580520	paying a lot of money for it.
6580520	6582520	Oh it's Nintendo and Nintendo makes good games.
6582520	6584520	You know what though? Sony makes good
6584520	6586520	games. Microsoft makes good
6586520	6588520	games. Lots of companies make good games.
6588520	6590520	Sony and Microsoft as we have seen
6590520	6592520	and discussed on the show are also not infallible
6592520	6594520	to making bad decisions. They're just
6594520	6596520	bad decisions of a different sort usually.
6596520	6598520	It's not usually the online thing that's
6598520	6600520	well no I take that back because
6600520	6602520	it's interesting because Microsoft kind of
6602520	6604520	had Microsoft's big screw
6604520	6606520	up was really in how they delivered
6606520	6608520	the message of their online.
6608520	6610520	I think if they had delivered that message in a
6610520	6612520	different way we'd be looking at a
6612520	6614520	completely different like ecosystem of gaming
6614520	6616520	right now with Xbox One.
6616520	6618520	If they had delivered the message in the appropriate way
6618520	6620520	and they could have maybe done that by not firing
6620520	6622520	their community outreach team but that's another story
6622520	6624520	that you know is again part of the problem.
6624520	6626520	But if Microsoft
6626520	6628520	had maybe delivered that message in a different way
6628520	6630520	I mean gaming would be so
6630520	6632520	I think different right now and I don't think Microsoft would have been
6632520	6634520	the bad guy this last generation as they
6634520	6636520	kind of ended up being for a time.
6636520	6638520	Yeah. It's just
6638520	6640520	at this point like
6640520	6642520	like how many times are we going to excuse
6642520	6644520	them. I'm sorry I'm jumping
6644520	6646520	because you don't chat says you mean if they lied. No that's
6646520	6648520	not what I mean. What I said was
6648520	6650520	if they delivered the message in a different way
6650520	6652520	I'll repeat that for you so you can hear that because I didn't
6652520	6654520	mean anything different. Thank you. It's just
6654520	6656520	at this point like it's kind of
6656520	6658520	like I get it like oh well we didn't
6658520	6660520	expect much from Nintendo but
6660520	6662520	why don't we like like look
6662520	6664520	at it look at look at their quality of their games
6664520	6666520	the effort that they put into the software
6666520	6668520	that runs on their stuff but they don't put
6668520	6670520	that same quality into
6670520	6672520	their networking. I mean like
6672520	6674520	that's kind of got to be a scar
6674520	6676520	on their brand because like Nintendo
6676520	6678520	is Nintendo not Nintendo is only
6678520	6680520	the games that run on it and only the hardware
6680520	6682520	but the the networking that's
6682520	6684520	absolute shit. Well that's
6684520	6686520	not Nintendo. You know bullshit
6686520	6688520	that's your fucking company. You got
6688520	6690520	to you got to put the same effort
6690520	6692520	into it. And this is ridiculous to not think
6692520	6694520	of designing your games while we're storing
6694520	6696520	all the player data locally.
6696520	6698520	You don't see anything wrong with
6698520	6700520	that. How
6700520	6702520	long has networking been a thing
6702520	6704520	like you know that's like basic shit
6704520	6706520	that you know that's not what you're supposed
6706520	6708520	to do. You store it in the cloud so
6708520	6710520	that they can't be manipulated.
6710520	6712520	I don't understand how this is
6712520	6714520	new information to them. It's like they've never
6714520	6716520	played another console
6716520	6718520	or never experienced
6718520	6720520	the world. I mean I don't get it.
6720520	6722520	Here's the unfortunate thing that's going to happen.
6722520	6724520	Nintendo is not going to change anything
6724520	6726520	why because Nintendo Online is going to
6726520	6728520	is going to sell just fine.
6728520	6730520	Plenty of people are going to sign up for Nintendo Online
6730520	6732520	because they want to play Smash Online
6732520	6734520	they want to play Splatoon Online they want to play Mario Kart Online
6734520	6736520	they want to play NES Classics even though
6736520	6738520	we all know it's not as optimal. And that's fine.
6738520	6740520	People are going to pay the money and to be
6740520	6742520	to be fair it's cheaper than the others
6742520	6744520	so they're going to pay the money to do all that
6744520	6746520	online and
6746520	6748520	Nintendo is not going to be motivated
6748520	6750520	to change it. And then that's fine. And you know
6750520	6752520	what it may not be a thing where it
6752520	6754520	affects them right now. It will
6754520	6756520	eventually eventually someone they're going to
6756520	6758520	hit everybody's breaking point to
6758520	6760520	where it's just going to they're either going to
6760520	6762520	fix it and it's going to get better
6762520	6764520	or they're just going to keep
6764520	6766520	doing this shit and eventually it's not going to be acceptable
6766520	6768520	anymore. It's like kind of like with
6768520	6770520	new phones that come out where
6770520	6772520	they hardly change anything you know
6772520	6774520	add a little bit of spit polish
6774520	6776520	to it and then they charge another two hundred dollars
6776520	6778520	on top of what they charged for the phone last year.
6778520	6780520	I mean it's
6780520	6782520	eventually some people
6782520	6784520	will keep upgrading and stuff like that but
6784520	6786520	eventually it's like OK really
6786520	6788520	what am I paying for. This isn't that different you know
6788520	6790520	it's going to end up like that.
6790520	6792520	Well it's like you know this isn't
6792520	6794520	really acceptable at this time like I can
6794520	6796520	get much better. Yeah I'm paying a little bit more
6796520	6798520	for the service on this
6798520	6800520	console but I'm getting a lot more
6800520	6802520	free games. No. Yeah.
6802520	6804520	Free games and just features
6804520	6806520	like I'm not even taught like free games aside
6806520	6808520	let's just pretend we don't even get those stupid NES
6808520	6810520	games. OK. Share play
6810520	6812520	is I think is a huge thing that yeah
6812520	6814520	Sony has no sharing share plays a huge share
6814520	6816520	plays a huge thing. People don't talk enough
6816520	6818520	about that. That's a huge deal. But like
6818520	6820520	even just like voice chat
6820520	6822520	on the console to be clear. I've said a lot
6822520	6824520	of negative stuff about Sony tonight with
6824520	6826520	the classic and everything but I give
6826520	6828520	credit where credit is due like that share play
6828520	6830520	is is truly an amazing
6830520	6832520	and under talked about feature. It really
6832520	6834520	does like it allows you to try games
6834520	6836520	that you don't fucking own.
6836520	6838520	It's pretty great. I mean just
6838520	6840520	just like even
6840520	6842520	basics left like voice chat
6842520	6844520	using the system not a phone
6844520	6846520	app. Why the hell do I have to have a phone
6846520	6848520	app to voice. That's stupid.
6848520	6850520	That's stupid. Any console
6850520	6852520	like you don't as Fortnite has demonstrated
6852520	6854520	you don't exactly
6854520	6856520	why Nintendo on their own
6856520	6858520	platform their own product
6858520	6860520	like they're supposed to be the best at
6860520	6862520	making games like they're just like fantastic
6862520	6864520	but yet it's
6864520	6866520	stupid. It's like who designed
6866520	6868520	this shit.
6868520	6870520	Like seriously what
6870520	6872520	programmer out there said hey
6872520	6874520	this is a good fucking idea.
6876520	6878520	Who did this.
6880520	6882520	I don't get it. It just doesn't
6882520	6884520	make any sense. But you
6884520	6886520	know what. Whatever.
6886520	6888520	It's just it's gonna be what it is.
6888520	6890520	It's just gonna be the hassle that we're gonna
6890520	6892520	have to deal with.
6892520	6894520	All right.
6894520	6896520	Bobby Black Wolf in chat
6896520	6898520	was point out no programmer said that it
6898520	6900520	was management. Exactly.
6900520	6902520	But who let them say that was a good who
6902520	6904520	ran with that idea though. Like
6904520	6906520	someone has to say you know what
6906520	6908520	you see in the modern age that
6908520	6910520	we're living in that's stupid and no one
6910520	6912520	does it that way.
6912520	6914520	And management said I don't
6914520	6916520	care that's what we're doing says Bobby.
6916520	6918520	Well
6918520	6920520	we've we've seen what bad
6920520	6922520	management can do. But but Nintendo
6922520	6924520	like the thing is like it's just
6924520	6926520	it's just not going to stop because for
6926520	6928520	the reasons I pointed out this
6928520	6930520	Nintendo online thing is going to do just fine.
6930520	6932520	They have to fall from their graces in order
6932520	6934520	for this shit to happen. It's
6934520	6936520	what has to happen is that
6936520	6938520	a kid has to get hurt
6938520	6940520	somehow due to this. And I
6940520	6942520	would never advocate for violence against children.
6942520	6944520	That's not what I'm saying. But I'm just saying you'll notice
6944520	6946520	Nintendo doesn't do like crazy things and like change
6946520	6948520	things up until kids could possibly
6948520	6950520	be in danger. Where are my paper cut stories
6950520	6952520	from Labo?
6952520	6954520	That's when things
6954520	6956520	will change. That's when like
6956520	6958520	they're not just going to change it they'll
6958520	6960520	full on delete it like they did with SwapNote
6960520	6962520	because kids may be in
6962520	6964520	danger. So that's
6964520	6966520	storing files on the
6966520	6968520	server. What has to happen is that there has to be
6968520	6970520	like threatening messages to children in
6970520	6972520	those files for that to stop.
6972520	6974520	Like we have the friend codes in there.
6974520	6976520	I hope you know I'm being ridiculous. Like why we have
6976520	6978520	friend codes in there if voice chat's
6978520	6980520	going to be turned off. Oh
6980520	6982520	well it could be a rapist that's
6982520	6984520	going to try to you know contact them. Then why
6984520	6986520	have the friend codes in the first place if it's not
6986520	6988520	going to stop anything. It doesn't
6988520	6990520	make it stupid. It's just so
6990520	6992520	many levels of stupid. Okay on
6992520	6994520	a different note we had a story
6994520	6996520	that got cut for tonight because in
6996520	6998520	my mind it wasn't really a story. It was something you posted.
6998520	7000520	It wasn't really a story. It was somebody sharing
7000520	7002520	their experiences and they said that they were playing
7002520	7004520	Mario Kart online
7004520	7006520	and using the voice chat app when
7006520	7008520	you would expect that playing online with
7008520	7010520	strangers is going to be a shit house
7010520	7012520	as it usually is on Xbox Live
7012520	7014520	on PlayStation Network is that you hear
7014520	7016520	all sorts of racial slurs
7016520	7018520	things against you know
7018520	7020520	gay slurs things like that
7020520	7022520	is the type of stuff you hear online. But apparently
7022520	7024520	some people's
7024520	7026520	experience on Nintendo's online service
7026520	7028520	has been very pleasant.
7028520	7030520	Apparently getting online playing Mario Kart it's like
7030520	7032520	oh well you know that's
7032520	7034520	quite the race wasn't it.
7034520	7036520	Yeah well
7036520	7038520	we're having a jolly time aren't we.
7038520	7040520	It's like I just
7040520	7042520	just have the option where you speak to only
7042520	7044520	your friends.
7044520	7046520	But you have friend codes. Apparently talking
7046520	7048520	to strangers on Nintendo online is not all
7048520	7050520	bad. Well so is it. You're not there.
7050520	7052520	As it is as it is on
7052520	7054520	like Xbox and PlayStation
7054520	7056520	it's the same everywhere. There's going to be assholes
7056520	7058520	everywhere. But there's also
7058520	7060520	not everybody is an asshole
7060520	7062520	out there like that. That's the thing. Don't just
7062520	7064520	assume it's going to be shit. If it was
7064520	7066520	all shit then they wouldn't offer it as a service.
7068520	7070520	Dark Sakura have you missed your weekly
7070520	7072520	Nintendo rants by Loki.
7072520	7074520	It's not that Nintendo rants
7074520	7076520	stupid if Sony did the same
7076520	7078520	thing I'd be just as mad at them. It's
7078520	7080520	dumb. All right
7080520	7082520	let's move on. Breathe in
7082520	7084520	breathe out Loki. We still have some news to cover
7084520	7086520	before we get to phone calls. Orange launch
7086520	7088520	radio on Skype. I believe we're done with
7088520	7090520	emails right. That was the last email. Yeah that was it.
7090520	7092520	All right. Thank you Flaco for the email.
7092520	7094520	Look at what you did. All right. Anyway
7094520	7096520	everybody follow Flaco on
7096520	7098520	Twitch especially because I can't broadcast right now.
7098520	7100520	So you should watch Flaco instead. You know
7100520	7102520	obviously there's many people I recommend on Twitch.
7102520	7104520	What I'd really recommend. Look at our
7104520	7106520	Discord server if you go to vognetwork.com
7106520	7108520	Discord because we have a Twitch channel
7108520	7110520	where people alert when they're live. And so
7110520	7112520	I would say watch all those people.
7112520	7114520	This is fantastic. All right. Let's get back into
7114520	7116520	some news before we get to some calls. Orange launch
7116520	7118520	radio on Skype. Loki. So
7118520	7120520	this week was the big old
7120520	7122520	Red Dead Redemption 2
7122520	7124520	media blitz where
7124520	7126520	they had allowed a lot of the
7126520	7128520	different outlets out there
7128520	7130520	to check out the game for a few hours.
7130520	7132520	Also they talked a little bit about Red Dead
7132520	7134520	Online which is going to be launching
7134520	7136520	after the game launches
7136520	7138520	the following month in November.
7138520	7140520	They're going to start a public beta.
7140520	7142520	They basically said as with most online experiences
7142520	7144520	of this size and scale there will inevitably
7144520	7146520	be some turbulence at launch.
7146520	7148520	So they're hoping
7148520	7150520	that with this beta test that they're
7150520	7152520	going to help iron those out.
7152520	7154520	You know
7154520	7156520	same with
7156520	7158520	I think Grand Theft Auto 5 had a big
7158520	7160520	shit show when it came to
7160520	7162520	Grand Theft Auto Online. Also
7162520	7164520	what we've learned from the experience when launching online
7164520	7166520	games at this scale there are bound to be a few
7166520	7168520	issues and we want to ensure that we have time
7168520	7170520	to gradually roll out the game and make sure
7170520	7172520	the experience is as smooth as possible for
7172520	7174520	everyone that we can. And we believe
7174520	7176520	this way of rolling out
7176520	7178520	will give people the best overall experience
7178520	7180520	both single player and multiplayer.
7180520	7182520	And from what I hear the game
7182520	7184520	the online portion is supposed to be pretty similar to Red Dead
7184520	7186520	Redemption
7186520	7188520	the multiplayer in that game
7188520	7190520	which is actually pretty fun. I did play
7190520	7192520	quite a bit of that. It was one
7192520	7194520	of the games that did support System
7194520	7196520	Link at the time so we ended up
7196520	7198520	playing that quite a bit but it was fun
7198520	7200520	there's the kind of free roam and do all that.
7200520	7202520	I'm
7202520	7204520	I can't wait to check it out though.
7204520	7206520	It sounds pretty cool.
7206520	7208520	It looks pretty.
7208520	7210520	And because
7210520	7212520	of all these media outlets and talking about the
7212520	7214520	detail because I remember the one thing with Grand Theft Auto 5
7214520	7216520	was the level of detail and
7216520	7218520	the one thing that stood out with me of course
7218520	7220520	because someone's going to ask that
7220520	7222520	they asked about the horse testicle
7222520	7224520	physics. Oh good god.
7224520	7226520	And apparently yes there are
7226520	7228520	horse testicle physics and not only
7228520	7230520	are there horse testicle physics
7230520	7232520	but they even went so far as
7232520	7234520	when your horse is walking through
7234520	7236520	wintery environment the testicles actually
7236520	7238520	shrink and expand and compare
7238520	7240520	depending on the heat.
7240520	7242520	That is some level of detail right there.
7242520	7244520	I appreciate
7244520	7246520	attention to detail.
7246520	7248520	OK. But I want to know
7248520	7250520	because look here's my
7250520	7252520	thing with horses. Whenever you
7252520	7254520	watch horses like you'll see the horses at
7254520	7256520	Disneyland you'll see the horses in a parade.
7256520	7258520	Everybody sees the horses in a parade. You know what
7258520	7260520	I associate those horses with? The fact
7260520	7262520	that right when they get in front of where you're watching they take
7262520	7264520	a gigantic fucking dump.
7264520	7266520	They probably will do that.
7266520	7268520	Well the horses in Red Dead
7268520	7270520	Redemption just like is it that thing
7270520	7272520	if you go too long without moving the controller
7272520	7274520	like you know how like idle animation
7274520	7276520	they might tap the screen like you know the whole thing
7276520	7278520	does the horse like if you just stand there for too long does the horse
7278520	7280520	just take a massive shit on the ground?
7280520	7282520	I don't know. Because it's bored.
7282520	7284520	But it just
7284520	7286520	that I can only imagine the level
7286520	7288520	of detail in the game is going to be incredible
7288520	7290520	just because in Grand Theft Auto 5
7290520	7292520	is incredible and it's been so many years after that
7292520	7294520	so I
7294520	7296520	can't wait. Bobby Blackwolf
7296520	7298520	in chat says imagine marching behind them in a band.
7298520	7300520	I have. I was a marching band in high school
7300520	7302520	and they used to tell us like well if
7302520	7304520	that happens you just got to march right through
7304520	7306520	it and no we marched around
7306520	7308520	it. No. Sorry.
7308520	7310520	Like you know oh the team's going to lose points.
7310520	7312520	I'm not going to step in that. No I won't be
7312520	7314520	doing that today. Let's see.
7314520	7316520	And Brad from Pod Culture confirms
7316520	7318520	there is horse crapping in Red Dead Redemption 2.
7318520	7320520	Oh. Oh happy day.
7320520	7322520	Hooray.
7322520	7324520	It's so realistic.
7324520	7326520	Mmhmm.
7326520	7328520	I just. I'm just
7328520	7330520	waiting for somebody to ask. I'm watching
7330520	7332520	chat like a hawk. I'm waiting for somebody
7332520	7334520	to ask.
7334520	7336520	Can you
7336520	7338520	fuck the horse?
7338520	7340520	Can you
7340520	7342520	Can you
7342520	7344520	be a horse fucker?
7344520	7346520	No.
7346520	7348520	Can you eat the horse?
7348520	7350520	Apparently horse is supposed to be
7350520	7352520	pretty delicious.
7352520	7354520	Alright moving on.
7354520	7356520	Hey let's talk.
7356520	7358520	Dartitsia said they'll probably be a PC mod for that.
7358520	7360520	You're right. No it'll never come out on PC
7360520	7362520	apparently they said. So it's never
7362520	7364520	come out. Sure. Red Dead Redemption 1 never
7364520	7366520	came out on PC. Oh I guess that's
7366520	7368520	true. So they said it's never coming out on
7368520	7370520	PC. Alright.
7370520	7372520	Anyhow let's talk about something that will be
7372520	7374520	coming out on PC and something very different from
7374520	7376520	horse shitting and fucking dicks.
7376520	7378520	There is no
7378520	7380520	way that you can make pinball
7380520	7382520	nasty. That's right pinball
7382520	7384520	is a wholesome family fucking. Until now with
7384520	7386520	horse fucker the table.
7386520	7388520	There have been some adult themed
7388520	7390520	pinball tables. Alright alright. Let's go
7390520	7392520	from one balls to another.
7392520	7394520	Talking about pinball. We've
7394520	7396520	talked in the past few weeks on the show about how
7396520	7398520	Zen Studios got the
7398520	7400520	Williams table. That should have been one of the
7400520	7402520	stories I put in the poll to ask you about
7402520	7404520	Dartitsia. But Zen Studios is getting that
7404520	7406520	license from pinball
7406520	7408520	excuse me from
7408520	7410520	Farsight excuse me who had the
7410520	7412520	Williams
7412520	7414520	and Bally license before.
7414520	7416520	We know Zen Studios got that.
7416520	7418520	And they've been testing. I actually
7418520	7420520	did the beta test in
7420520	7422520	Steam. You can turn it on and you can play
7422520	7424520	a demo
7424520	7426520	demo table and they're gonna make this table
7426520	7428520	free for everybody. The
7428520	7430520	Fish Tales is the table that
7430520	7432520	will be like the free for
7432520	7434520	everybody to get you to download the game and
7434520	7436520	check it out. And then if you wanna get
7436520	7438520	more tables you'll be able to get
7438520	7440520	the very first pack volume 1
7440520	7442520	on October 9th will
7442520	7444520	include Medieval Madness
7444520	7446520	Junkyard and the Getaway
7446520	7448520	High Speed 2. It will set you back
7448520	7450520	9.99. That's 9.99
7450520	7452520	US dollars. 9.99
7452520	7454520	euros. It will
7454520	7456520	be free. Fish Tales
7456520	7458520	will be free and the other games will
7458520	7460520	cost you. It's going to be out on Nintendo Switch,
7460520	7462520	PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows 10
7462520	7464520	Steam and Zen Pinball
7464520	7466520	2 on the Mac.
7466520	7468520	So even though Pinball FX3 never came out on
7468520	7470520	the Mac, Zen Pinball 2 on the
7470520	7472520	Mac will support these. That's kinda interesting how they
7472520	7474520	did that. So there you go.
7474520	7476520	I don't know if any of you are gonna
7476520	7478520	check that out. I
7478520	7480520	you know those tables are okay. I mean
7480520	7482520	Medieval Madness is kind of a classic. I'm not a fan. I've got
7482520	7484520	Medieval Madness in my house. I know.
7484520	7486520	You're not a fan of the emulated because you're so
7486520	7488520	attached to the real thing. Yeah.
7488520	7490520	But Fish Tales also isn't very fun to me.
7490520	7492520	For those of us that can't afford the real thing though.
7492520	7494520	This is
7494520	7496520	an okay substitute. But I really
7496520	7498520	Pinball is the one I really want. That's my favorite.
7498520	7500520	You may be selling Getaway.
7500520	7502520	Oh really? Wow.
7502520	7504520	If you're interested. Nah, I don't know.
7504520	7506520	This house has enough shit in it.
7506520	7508520	I'll say if I can get rid of three Pinball
7508520	7510520	machine size things worth of shit then
7510520	7512520	I'll allow a Pinball machine in here.
7512520	7514520	We'll see.
7514520	7516520	Alright. Let's move on.
7516520	7518520	Darcyra. Well
7518520	7520520	there is a new cause
7520520	7522520	of divorce in this
7522520	7524520	country and it's called Fortnite.
7524520	7526520	More than 200
7526520	7528520	UK couples filed for divorce
7528520	7530520	in 2018.
7530520	7532520	And they cited addiction to Fortnite
7532520	7534520	as their reason for divorce.
7534520	7536520	If that's all it took to cause
7536520	7538520	a divorce then somebody in that family
7538520	7540520	was boring the shit out of the other
7540520	7542520	person in that family.
7542520	7544520	But that's
7544520	7546520	actually about 5% of
7546520	7548520	the 4,665
7548520	7550520	petitions that
7550520	7552520	Divorce Online has
7552520	7554520	handled. It's actually
7554520	7556520	a UK company that offers divorce
7556520	7558520	services.
7558520	7560520	And that seems to be the
7560520	7562520	biggest one that came up.
7562520	7564520	And this is also
7564520	7566520	going hand in hand with the World Health Organization
7566520	7568520	saying compulsive video game playing now
7568520	7570520	constitutes a mental
7570520	7572520	health condition.
7572520	7574520	Um.
7574520	7576520	Yeah.
7576520	7578520	I don't know. I mean
7578520	7580520	if you want to pick an excuse I guess
7580520	7582520	that's as good as any. You could just say
7582520	7584520	we don't do anything
7584520	7586520	together. We don't communicate. We don't
7586520	7588520	leave the house.
7588520	7590520	So. That's kind of what Kaijuto is
7590520	7592520	referencing in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
7592520	7594520	says I'm sure they had problems
7594520	7596520	before Fortnite.
7596520	7598520	So maybe Fortnite is just kind of like the
7598520	7600520	objectification
7600520	7602520	of all those things into one
7602520	7604520	sort of tangible thing.
7604520	7606520	I don't know. Fifth Dream in chat says
7606520	7608520	I'd divorce anyone who likes Fortnite too.
7608520	7610520	Now now Fifth Dream. It's a very very
7610520	7612520	popular game. There's many people to play it.
7612520	7614520	Alright.
7614520	7616520	Well it's
7616520	7618520	always interesting when video games
7618520	7620520	get into other parts
7620520	7622520	of life like that. So.
7622520	7624520	I wonder what we'll be seeing on the divorce
7624520	7626520	court. The TV show
7626520	7628520	Divorce of My Man because he plays too much
7628520	7630520	Fortnite. S.S.J. remembers
7630520	7632520	S2100 Matt in our chat says
7632520	7634520	remember when World of Warcraft was the cause
7634520	7636520	of divorces back in the day.
7636520	7638520	Remember the good old days Dark Sakura when it was
7638520	7640520	my husband.
7640520	7642520	My husband plays a horde
7642520	7644520	and I just can't marry a man because I'm
7644520	7646520	I'm an alliance character.
7646520	7648520	They had like wow widows.
7648520	7650520	Oh yeah. That's what Victoria always
7650520	7652520	claimed to be herself was a wow widow.
7652520	7654520	When she had dated
7654520	7656520	that guy who was too busy as she
7656520	7658520	said storming the castle. That's what she called
7658520	7660520	raiding. He was too busy to go out because he was always
7660520	7662520	storming the castle with his friends. I just think of
7662520	7664520	the princess bride like that. Me too
7664520	7666520	but that's kind of what it is. Bye bye boys.
7666520	7668520	Have fun storming the castle.
7668520	7670520	That's what raiding is. You're storming the castle
7670520	7672520	with your friends. Alright
7672520	7674520	anyway. Let's move on. A few more
7674520	7676520	stories for you guys before the Skype line.
7676520	7678520	Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype.
7678520	7680520	Loki pretty big story here towards the end.
7680520	7682520	Yes so we kind of
7682520	7684520	alluded to it a couple weeks ago
7684520	7686520	talking about that there was a rumor that you're
7686520	7688520	going to be able to start downloading titles
7688520	7690520	as part of PlayStation Now which has always
7690520	7692520	been my gripe because PlayStation Now I think
7692520	7694520	is a terrible service
7694520	7696520	as far as having to stream all the time
7696520	7698520	and I wish they would let you download it like
7698520	7700520	you know you can with games pass
7700520	7702520	but now apparently you can with
7702520	7704520	most of the titles on there
7704520	7706520	and they're going to be starting I guess with
7706520	7708520	almost all of the PlayStation 4 games
7708520	7710520	in the service including Bloodborne,
7710520	7712520	God of War 3 remastered, NBA 2K16
7712520	7714520	and Until Dawn will be available for
7714520	7716520	download in addition
7716520	7718520	to the PlayStation Now lineup
7718520	7720520	of classic PlayStation 2 games
7720520	7722520	that they remastered for PlayStation 4
7722520	7724520	and then they said they've
7724520	7726520	they'll be rolling out that feature to
7726520	7728520	PlayStation Now subscribers over the next few days
7728520	7730520	so if you don't see it
7730520	7732520	just check back later.
7732520	7734520	A lot of people very happy about this change
7734520	7736520	that Sony was kind of pressured to do so
7736520	7738520	in response to Microsoft's system allowing you to
7738520	7740520	do this. Yeah and
7740520	7742520	like you know you still have to phone in
7742520	7744520	every once in a while to you know so you can't
7744520	7746520	play offline for a long time but it's
7746520	7748520	still nice to have
7748520	7750520	that option. Still don't want to
7750520	7752520	play the service though because
7752520	7754520	a lot of the games that are in there I already
7754520	7756520	own and
7756520	7758520	yeah. Fifth Dream says
7758520	7760520	and they will take advantage of PS4 Pro
7760520	7762520	hardware. That's good.
7762520	7764520	Is PS4 Pro
7764520	7766520	kind of the default now? Do you still get
7766520	7768520	regular PlayStations that aren't Pro anymore?
7768520	7770520	I guess you probably still do. Yeah they do.
7770520	7772520	I would imagine at some point PlayStation 4 Pro
7772520	7774520	would just be the default. Someday
7774520	7776520	but it has to come down in price
7776520	7778520	I think. Yeah that's true. And
7778520	7780520	they still do that with the Xbox too. The Xbox
7780520	7782520	One and S and X.
7782520	7784520	Alright
7784520	7786520	well finally here tonight before we
7786520	7788520	go to our Skype line at Orange Launch Radio
7788520	7790520	all one word on Skype although I'll ask if there's any
7790520	7792520	last minute stories as well. We do have a couple
7792520	7794520	stories here about game companies who have
7794520	7796520	helped to fulfill some final wishes
7796520	7798520	of younger folks
7798520	7800520	that are suffering with
7800520	7802520	some different diseases and it's kind of one of those things
7802520	7804520	where it's like ah man these are real like
7804520	7806520	you know just bad situations
7806520	7808520	and unfortunate but it's really cool
7808520	7810520	that these gaming companies are helping
7810520	7812520	these gaming fans
7812520	7814520	in their last days to be able to
7814520	7816520	play the games that they really want to play.
7816520	7818520	The first story I have here has to do with Bethesda
7818520	7820520	who showed up when
7820520	7822520	a 12 year old boy who had a rare form
7822520	7824520	of cancer wanted to play Fallout
7824520	7826520	76. The kid was from
7826520	7828520	Hampton Roads, Virginia. He was battling
7828520	7830520	stage 4 neuroblastoma
7830520	7832520	for half his life. He was diagnosed at 5 years old.
7832520	7834520	Doctors have
7834520	7836520	stopped his treatment but
7836520	7838520	then he realized he probably would not get to play Fallout
7838520	7840520	76 which is due in November.
7840520	7842520	And I realize you could probably say some
7842520	7844520	stuff here because I think Fallout is an M rated
7844520	7846520	series and he's a 12 year old kid but you know
7846520	7848520	what? That
7848520	7850520	that's the family's decision to make not yours.
7850520	7852520	So he wanted to play Fallout 76
7852520	7854520	and apparently
7854520	7856520	the assistant director at Bethesda actually
7856520	7858520	drove 4 hours from the company's
7858520	7860520	headquarters in Maryland to the family
7860520	7862520	home with a copy of the game and
7862520	7864520	a prototype of the power
7864520	7866520	armor helmet that's going to come with that
7866520	7868520	super special edition of the game
7868520	7870520	signed by the chief of Bethesda
7870520	7872520	game studios Todd Howard.
7872520	7874520	So unfortunately he didn't get to keep
7874520	7876520	the game because it's just too early
7876520	7878520	and to be fair in
7878520	7880520	these situations if it is
7880520	7882520	out there in the media that somebody has
7882520	7884520	something super special like this it makes
7884520	7886520	you a target for thieves
7886520	7888520	and so it's not that Bethesda's trying to
7888520	7890520	be dicks by just not letting the kid keep
7890520	7892520	the game but it's actually risky
7892520	7894520	to let him keep it if you really
7894520	7896520	kind of critically think about it. It's
7896520	7898520	it's an unfortunate thing but that's
7898520	7900520	what it is.
7900520	7902520	So anyway even though he didn't get to keep
7902520	7904520	the game still the hours of playtime
7904520	7906520	made him happy and they were all very
7906520	7908520	very very happy to
7908520	7910520	make the wish come true and all that stuff and
7910520	7912520	the kid got to play the game so
7912520	7914520	that's really cool. There is a GoFundMe out there
7914520	7916520	for Wes trying to raise money to pay
7916520	7918520	living expenses and trying to get the
7918520	7920520	doctors in New York City and all this.
7920520	7922520	So our thoughts with
7922520	7924520	him and
7924520	7926520	kind of a similar story here. This time
7926520	7928520	Nintendo allowing a fan
7928520	7930520	to play Super Smash Brothers
7930520	7932520	Ultimate. This guy is a little
7932520	7934520	older. He's in his early 20s so he's
7934520	7936520	not a kid per se but he's got his own
7936520	7938520	Twitter account and everything. Chris Taylor
7938520	7940520	a big fan of Smash Brothers and he
7940520	7942520	also kind of you know he's battling
7942520	7944520	cancer as well and even though
7944520	7946520	he's beat cancer twice before he's being
7946520	7948520	told that it's terminal and he recently wanted
7948520	7950520	recently made the tough decision
7950520	7952520	to stop treatment for that
7952520	7954520	but kind of realized that oh I
7954520	7956520	I may not get to play Super Smash
7956520	7958520	Brothers Ultimate. So there was a
7958520	7960520	big you know push online like
7960520	7962520	gaming subreddits and you know people
7962520	7964520	trying to amplify this his wish
7964520	7966520	to be able to play this and
7966520	7968520	what happened? Nintendo flew
7968520	7970520	out an E3 demo of the
7970520	7972520	game to him
7972520	7974520	earlier this week and
7974520	7976520	he got to play the game for three hours. They
7976520	7978520	took some pictures and you can see some of
7978520	7980520	this on Twitter on his
7980520	7982520	Twitter. He's a spooky wubler on Twitter
7982520	7984520	and you can see some of the pictures and
7984520	7986520	you know again some people are like well why didn't they
7986520	7988520	why did he only get to play the E3 demo?
7988520	7990520	Why didn't he get to play the full game? Game's not done
7990520	7992520	yet. Well yeah for one the game's not
7992520	7994520	done yet for two
7994520	7996520	you know again same things I mentioned before is
7996520	7998520	that when those types of things are in the hands
7998520	8000520	you know and people know about it because
8000520	8002520	of social media in fact
8002520	8004520	he couldn't announce that this was happening
8004520	8006520	until they already left
8006520	8008520	and again it's because you
8008520	8010520	know it would make you potentially a
8010520	8012520	target for thievery and all this other stuff
8012520	8014520	which really it's unfortunate but anyway
8014520	8016520	very cool that these gaming companies
8016520	8018520	are helping to make some
8018520	8020520	wishes come true and lots of
8020520	8022520	people in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
8022520	8024520	giving a hearty
8024520	8026520	hashtag fuck cancer in our chat
8026520	8028520	and I agree but
8028520	8030520	I'm you know despite
8030520	8032520	the situation
8032520	8034520	I'm glad these gaming companies are
8034520	8036520	able to you know
8036520	8038520	help these folks out and let them play
8038520	8040520	what they want to play. Okay

8054520	8056520	right now live call at orange lounge
8056520	8058520	radio all one word on skype while we wait
8058520	8060520	to see if the skype line goes off

8066520	8068520	Yeah. Alright
8068520	8070520	not a lot going on
8070520	8072520	well dark sakura when do we get to see you
8072520	8074520	here again are you going to be here the last weekend of october
8074520	8076520	I'm going to try
8076520	8078520	yeah how are things going with
8078520	8080520	you know we didn't get asked
8080520	8082520	to ask a lot about this but I know sundays are also
8082520	8084520	a big thing for your sisters
8084520	8086520	our general meeting is every
8086520	8088520	fourth sunday
8088520	8090520	so I was up
8090520	8092520	way early this morning to go to the
8092520	8094520	sisters meeting had to leave that
8094520	8096520	fifteen minutes early to get
8096520	8098520	to work where
8098520	8100520	my
8100520	8102520	provisioning at my job had been
8102520	8104520	messed up so I didn't take any
8104520	8106520	calls today I did nothing but training
8106520	8108520	I was bored then I
8108520	8110520	left and now you're here
8110520	8112520	yes so you had a very busy day
8112520	8114520	hopefully I'll be able to make
8114520	8116520	I'll be able to perfect my pumpkin
8116520	8118520	bread not like a sweet bread
8118520	8120520	I'm planning on making a savory pumpkin
8120520	8122520	and that'll be the time where nobody can bitch about
8122520	8124520	the pumpkin stuff too because that'll be right around
8124520	8126520	Halloween when you're here next that'll be Halloween
8126520	8128520	weekend right October 28th will be that show
8128520	8130520	I think well I like savory
8130520	8132520	gourd stuff you know
8132520	8134520	like pumpkins and butternut squashes and stuff
8134520	8136520	like that I like it savory and buttery
8136520	8138520	and I've got my bread recipe
8138520	8140520	down like I can't bake cookies
8140520	8142520	and all that for shit but I can bake
8142520	8144520	bread some of the savory pumpkin
8144520	8146520	stuff's really good like we get this pumpkin
8146520	8148520	ravioli this time of year at Trader Joe's
8148520	8150520	it's really good so I think what I
8150520	8152520	do is just get like the pumpkin pulp
8152520	8154520	and spiral it in
8154520	8156520	in my dough and then
8156520	8158520	just let it bake from inside the dough
8158520	8160520	I think that would be good
8160520	8162520	and then just make it buttery and savory
8162520	8164520	again the Skype line is open hopefully somebody
8164520	8166520	will call but if not then not
8166520	8168520	Orange Tons Radio all one word on
8168520	8170520	Skype if you want to get through on the Skype line tonight
8170520	8172520	I'm not that intimidating boys
8172520	8174520	I will not be doing a live feed after the show tonight
8174520	8176520	because again I'm still limited with my
8176520	8178520	upload I do hope to get that fixed
8178520	8180520	I have my gears turning in my
8180520	8182520	head about some projects that I
8182520	8184520	might work on so stay tuned to my Twitch channel
8184520	8186520	at Rob Roberts I may
8186520	8188520	try some experiments with video
8188520	8190520	premieres this week and see what you guys like
8190520	8192520	what gets attention and what nobody
8192520	8194520	seems to care about also apparently today
8194520	8196520	is the 129th
8196520	8198520	anniversary of Nintendo
8198520	8200520	oh right because they started as a playing card
8200520	8202520	company way way way back in the day they were not always
8202520	8204520	about what's that
8204520	8206520	oh right the specific type
8206520	8208520	of not like Jack of Clubs
8208520	8210520	King of Hearts those type of playing
8210520	8212520	cards but a very specific type of
8212520	8214520	card so Nintendo was not
8214520	8216520	always about electronics that's just kind of
8216520	8218520	what it turned into and what they're most known
8218520	8220520	for now we do have a call coming in
8220520	8222520	let's get to it hi you're on Orange Tons Radio who's
8222520	8224520	this hey this is Akdeft
8224520	8226520	hey Akdeft it's good to hear from you buddy
8226520	8228520	what's up
8228520	8230520	well I do want to talk about
8230520	8232520	the PlayStation Classic
8232520	8234520	okay what are your thoughts on it
8234520	8236520	it's kind of stupid
8236520	8238520	why you say that
8238520	8240520	you know there's a lot of people that would be very excited
8240520	8242520	about this why do you say it's crap
8242520	8244520	well
8244520	8246520	mostly I thought it was a good
8246520	8248520	idea it is
8248520	8250520	a good idea but
8250520	8252520	at the same time Sony's doing
8252520	8254520	a lot of stuff that
8254520	8256520	makes my head baffle like
8256520	8258520	like really aside
8258520	8260520	the fact it
8260520	8262520	doesn't have like an AC adapter
8262520	8264520	because yeah it's
8264520	8266520	probably it's gonna be like a
8266520	8268520	phone adapter and mostly like
8268520	8270520	the SNES or
8270520	8272520	NES Mini
8272520	8274520	but the fact that the controllers
8274520	8276520	aren't DualShock it's like
8276520	8278520	one of the first things that
8278520	8280520	I really don't know what
8280520	8282520	Sony is thinking
8284520	8286520	is it like
8286520	8288520	the game selection or is it just the price
8288520	8290520	what is it that's like turning you off
8290520	8292520	to this
8292520	8294520	so again the first thing is
8294520	8296520	the controllers like
8296520	8298520	they should be DualShocks
8298520	8300520	like really I don't know why
8300520	8302520	Sony is making those
8302520	8304520	yeah I don't disagree with that
8304520	8306520	that's for sure I sure don't disagree with that
8306520	8308520	but yeah the price point
8308520	8310520	I would agree with it
8310520	8312520	if it had like at least
8312520	8314520	five more games
8314520	8316520	if it had a DualShock if it had the AC
8316520	8318520	adapter
8318520	8320520	but I really don't know
8320520	8322520	in the game selection
8322520	8324520	for 20 games for a classic
8324520	8326520	system like this
8326520	8328520	seems like really
8328520	8330520	really low and I understand
8330520	8332520	that the SNES
8332520	8334520	Mini also has only
8334520	8336520	20 or 21 games
8336520	8338520	but those are all
8338520	8340520	classics like in this case
8340520	8342520	of the five they have announced
8342520	8344520	only
8344520	8346520	like well a side
8346520	8348520	Final Fantasy and maybe
8348520	8350520	Tekken 3
8350520	8352520	the other the rest aren't
8352520	8354520	that like
8354520	8356520	popular even something
8356520	8358520	like Ridge Racer
8358520	8360520	I don't think many people are
8360520	8362520	excited about it and something like
8362520	8364520	Jumping Flash that personally I
8364520	8366520	like it isn't
8366520	8368520	that great of a game and not many
8368520	8370520	people like even like it so
8370520	8372520	I really don't know
8372520	8374520	what Sony is thinking about this
8374520	8376520	console or what's the idea
8376520	8378520	Well they're thinking
8378520	8380520	how can we make money? How did our
8380520	8382520	competition make money? Oh we can do that
8382520	8384520	so I just
8384520	8386520	I still sort of think that they could have
8386520	8388520	you know really shown the value
8388520	8390520	of making people
8390520	8392520	or enticing people to buy a PlayStation
8392520	8394520	4 because oh you already
8394520	8396520	have this old library of games that will
8396520	8398520	automatically work on this new system
8398520	8400520	so feel free to get rid of your old
8400520	8402520	system by buying this new system that will play
8402520	8404520	all of your old games and I get
8404520	8406520	like again I get that the chipset
8406520	8408520	changes and those changes that happen
8408520	8410520	within the system especially make this very
8410520	8412520	hard with the PlayStation 3
8412520	8414520	although I still think they could have got around it with
8414520	8416520	PlayStation now but whatever
8416520	8418520	they didn't want to allocate that type of server
8418520	8420520	bandwidth and all that stuff but you know
8420520	8422520	at least the PlayStation 1 and 2 stuff you
8422520	8424520	would think would still be able to work but
8424520	8426520	Sony just doesn't see the value
8426520	8428520	in that and so this is
8428520	8430520	what they're deciding to do instead so
8430520	8432520	it is what it is so you have to
8432520	8434520	make a choice if you want to support it
8434520	8436520	and to be fair
8436520	8438520	you know it is a cute little thing
8438520	8440520	just like the little NES classic
8440520	8442520	NES it's cute it's something
8442520	8444520	that I like for the look of it and not just
8444520	8446520	what's inside of it but I do have to
8446520	8448520	admit in retrospect you know now
8448520	8450520	that I've played the Switch Online one it's like
8450520	8452520	eh was it $60
8452520	8454520	cute I don't know so I think
8454520	8456520	I think in some ways some of that is almost making me
8456520	8458520	hesitate when it comes to wanting
8458520	8460520	to get like a classic Sony system
8460520	8462520	I don't know
8462520	8464520	and that's the thing
8464520	8466520	like I really like want
8466520	8468520	to get this
8468520	8470520	because again it sounds like a great idea
8470520	8472520	it's I wouldn't mind
8472520	8474520	a classic Sony
8474520	8476520	console and just
8476520	8478520	plug and play like the SNES
8478520	8480520	and the NES Mini
8480520	8482520	but again
8482520	8484520	there are many things that
8484520	8486520	I don't know what Sony is thinking about
8486520	8488520	that really
8488520	8490520	I have one pre-ordered
8490520	8492520	on Amazon but I'm probably
8492520	8494520	gonna cancel it the only thing
8494520	8496520	and many people probably
8496520	8498520	are gonna yell at me because of this
8498520	8500520	is that probably
8500520	8502520	those consoles are
8502520	8504520	Playstation TV or Vita TVs
8504520	8506520	that they didn't
8506520	8508520	sell so it's probably
8508520	8510520	gonna be hackable like really
8510520	8512520	easily hackable
8512520	8514520	and you're probably
8514520	8516520	gonna insert
8516520	8518520	many like roms or homebrew
8518520	8520520	and so that's
8520520	8522520	the only appeal I see right now
8522520	8524520	for the console unless it has like
8524520	8526520	a really
8526520	8528520	cool game that hasn't
8528520	8530520	gotten a real release like
8530520	8532520	I was talking in chat earlier like
8532520	8534520	InHander it hasn't
8534520	8536520	gotten a real release ever
8536520	8538520	so like oh the console
8538520	8540520	has it okay I'm gonna get it
8540520	8542520	but aside from that I really
8542520	8544520	don't know why I would
8544520	8546520	buy one of these you know you
8546520	8548520	kind of reference something there I think is a huge
8548520	8550520	missed opportunity from Sony like if you're
8550520	8552520	gonna charge a hundred bucks for one of these and get
8552520	8554520	them in people's homes why not
8554520	8556520	make them capable of doing
8556520	8558520	the Vita TV stuff like a Playstation
8558520	8560520	or the Playstation Now thing
8560520	8562520	or a lot of that similar functionality
8562520	8564520	the Playstation TV which if I
8564520	8566520	recall correctly also cost a hundred bucks right
8566520	8568520	so yeah the Playstation
8568520	8570520	TVs nowadays are so cheap
8570520	8572520	well that's right so the technology the price
8572520	8574520	of those things should have come way down in technology
8574520	8576520	I can't imagine that you wouldn't
8576520	8578520	be able to get a Playstation emulator
8578520	8580520	on one of those Playstation Vita things
8580520	8582520	and play you know the PS1
8582520	8584520	classics and charge you a hundred bucks for that
8584520	8586520	you don't even need to get a Playstation 1 emulator they
8586520	8588520	have Playstation 1 natively
8588520	8590520	so why not sweeten the pot
8590520	8592520	and don't just make it about being able to play 20
8592520	8594520	Playstation classics but holy
8594520	8596520	shit this thing will play newer stuff too
8596520	8598520	and then maybe Sony wouldn't have had to
8598520	8600520	been so quick to abandon the Vita
8600520	8602520	but I just they weren't thinking far enough ahead I guess
8602520	8604520	I think it's more about wanting to
8604520	8606520	just you know strike while the iron
8606520	8608520	is hot so to speak on these classics
8608520	8610520	and as soon as Nintendo had their runaway
8610520	8612520	success a couple years ago the
8612520	8614520	gears were probably turning on this
8614520	8616520	well it's
8616520	8618520	a little too late for
8618520	8620520	that I think but it will still
8620520	8622520	sell people will
8622520	8624520	buy it at least but
8624520	8626520	I don't know if
8626520	8628520	Sony is gonna like
8628520	8630520	see like a really really
8630520	8632520	great success from this I
8632520	8634520	really don't but
8634520	8636520	I don't know hopefully they
8636520	8638520	they change some of this
8638520	8640520	or again if
8640520	8642520	it's hackable I think that
8642520	8644520	that's gonna be the appeal for this because
8644520	8646520	for at least for my part
8646520	8648520	it's like no
8648520	8650520	no Sony
8650520	8652520	alright my friend I'm gonna let you go so we can
8652520	8654520	see if anybody else wants to call but thanks for your
8654520	8656520	thoughts
8656520	8658520	alright bye bye

8704520	8706520	um yeah the local one here
8706520	8708520	I see a lot of tweets about
8708520	8710520	it it's so expensive and it's just like
8710520	8712520	what is it really there they have like
8712520	8714520	some streamers that are there they do
8714520	8716520	like a Lego thing they do like some other Minecraft
8716520	8718520	stuff but it's like it's so god
8718520	8720520	damn it it's like 40 bucks a ticket
8720520	8722520	oh yeah that's a little pricey
8722520	8724520	MineCon world is next week and it's online
8724520	8726520	it's streaming so
8726520	8728520	interesting okay
