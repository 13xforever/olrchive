Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
After a planned and unplanned weekend off, we're back and we've got lots of news to catch up on.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
Join us for a few weeks worth of updates on VR DLC releases, streaming of multiple kinds, and the long arm of the law.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
All this, your comments and more, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
Orange Lounge Radio. It feels so good to say that. Episode number 744 for this September 16th of 2018.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined of course here in studio. We're based in Sacramento, California.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
The one and only, Techmaster Loki.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Hello.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Hello, hello. Good to have you back.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Yes, good to be back.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
It's good to be back. It's been a couple weeks, as mentioned in the intro.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
And by the way, of course, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers, she is on a planned leave due to her day job.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
She'll be joining us through the magic of a radio a little later on in the show in a pre-taped segment.

01:11.000 --> 01:20.000
So, but as far as being in the now is concerned, we were always going to be off two weeks ago because I was at DragonCon.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
Which, by the way, my god, DragonCon at this point feels like it was six months ago, okay?

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
I mean, it just, it feels like it was an eternity, but I had a fantastic, wonderful, amazing time at DragonCon.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
It really was like my best year yet in many ways. I'll talk a little more about that in a minute.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
So I knew I was going to be off for that show and that was Labor Day anyway.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
But then we unexpectedly missed last week and things happen, you guys.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
What happened is that, and I'll just kind of give you disclosure, it actually was not Loki or myself or DarkSakura that was sick.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
It was actually Alan, my husband, who lives here as well.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
And he, I think it's okay that I disclose this. It is a little, it's a little crazy, y'all.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
He had a disease called hand foot mouth disease, which is something that usually children get.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
I don't think folks above five years old.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
That is not necessarily true.

02:08.000 --> 02:15.000
Yes. So adults can get it too. But the weird thing is, and what's stumping all the doctors, is that they couldn't figure out how he got it.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
Because he's not around kids. We don't have kids.

02:19.000 --> 02:27.000
So here's the thing. The doctor thinks he got it from food because he was eating out all the time while I was out at DragonCon.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
And it started to settle in about the Wednesday.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Kids are everywhere.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Yeah, I know. It's crazy, right? So that's, I mean, that's what it was.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
He's fine now and he's not here anyway.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
But, and honestly, could we have done the show last week?

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
Probably, but I did not want to take the risk because since it is a kid disease, I did not want Loki to get it. He's had it before.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
I've already had it, yeah.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
Well, I didn't want you to get the cooties and then give it to your kids. That's what I really didn't want to happen.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
Well, my son's had it. My oldest son had it and I got it from him. And it's not fun because you get blisters all over your hands.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
It's like chicken pox, but worse.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I've never had chicken pox, so.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Oh, I hope you've had the vaccine because that's, that's tough.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
I haven't had the vaccine either. I've lived dangerously, but no.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
You should talk to your doctor about that.

03:07.000 --> 03:15.000
Uh, I've had the, um, disease. So yeah, basically I got blisters all over my hands and my feet.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
No DDR when you have that.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
No, and it was hard to play games. I still played games, but it was hard because like it was uncomfortable a little bit.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
But then eventually they go away.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah, and that's where he's at now. They went away.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
They get like a fever, I guess, for like a day and then it just, it's just all blisters and that's it.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
And so the crazy, I never got it and we live together and you know, we're married.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
Well, my wife never got it and my youngest son never got it.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
Yeah, it's weird. So, and we, I don't know if it's because maybe I had it as a kid and I just don't know.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
I know I had chicken pox, but I don't, I don't know about, I mean, I would have been too young to remember anyway.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
But anyway, this isn't the disease and infectious podcast, it's a video game podcast.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
But I wanted to give you guys a reason why we've been away for two weeks.

03:55.000 --> 04:05.000
And also, you know, coming on the heels of Dragon Con, you know that I've done a lot of work and I'm very thankful to be included with the Dragon Con podcasting track,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
which by the way, they're going to have a brand new name next year.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
It's now the Dragon Con Digital Media Creation Track or DMC.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
Devil may cry. No, but it's Digital Media Creation Track.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
So I've been involved with them for a long time.

04:18.000 --> 04:27.000
So every time I come back from Dragon Con, I'm like so motivated to like broadcast and like, I need to start three more podcasts and let's revive a podcast I did 10 years ago and all that stuff.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Like that's, that's what happens to me when I come back from Dragon Con.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
And then I had a Twitch 101 panel and that went really well.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
And I was like, I need to do all the things on Twitch and I need to be streaming more.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
So I'm so motivated. I get back and my internet is crazy.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
Like I'm not able to upload the speeds that I usually upload at.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
So my 10 megabit upload for some reason is only five megabits when I uploaded Twitch.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
But yet even if I lower my bit rate down to like 4000 or something under that, I still have problems.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
So there's something really weird and I don't want to get into it on this show.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
I've detailed it on my Twitter at MrRobRoberts. I did actually a Twitch video tonight.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
So what I did, I used that whole premiere thing on Twitch.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
I recorded a video for 40 minutes at like two o'clock.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
I like played one of the new dungeons in World of Warcraft since I've been tinkering in that expansion.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
And then I scheduled a premiere for like 4.15 or whenever my video was finally done processing.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
And so it premiered right at that time.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
And so it was like a pseudo live stream.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
I wasn't really live, but it was like I was live. I just didn't have the chat comments.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
So I guess it's kind of like here at Vaga Network.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
Our radio feed is, you know, we have new episodes of Pod Culture, Mondays, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
You know, it's kind of like a premiere in that regard.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
That's kind of what I did on Twitch.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
So I talked much more about that.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
So if you want to see my Twitch channel, MrRobRoberts, I get into all the details about what's going on back and forth.

05:54.000 --> 06:01.000
But I'm just in such a good mood now to be doing this show because I feel like my rhythm got thrown

06:01.000 --> 06:07.000
when I was at my most motivated I've been throughout the year post Dragon Con.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
And so, yeah, it's just it feels great to be back.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
I'll talk about Dragon Con a little more later on, but it is a video game show.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
And there's a lot of big video game news going on this week, namely the Nintendo Direct.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Why don't we dive into that first, especially because this might be the show.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
I mean, hopefully the first OLR people are hearing coming off Dragon Con is not the one where I got very emotional,

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
which is the last, which is the show that's been sitting on the feed for three weeks before we went to Dragon Con.

06:32.000 --> 06:39.000
But I would like to like to have a little enthusiasm, a little talk here on video games and what's going on with Nintendo.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
So obviously everybody's talking about this Nintendo Direct.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Loki, let's jump in. What did Nintendo do with their Direct?

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
They announced games.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Well, that's good. We like game. We like game announcements, right?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Yeah. And then they talk.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Nintendo's biggest critic. How do you on this show, how do you how do you feel coming off this Nintendo Direct?

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
OK. It wasn't like like I saw one, especially like I paid attention.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
Actually, that's when I came in the shows when they were talking about their online services, like in the middle of that.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
OK. It's just all right.

07:07.000 --> 07:13.000
I mean, it's not very fleshed out, but you're not paying a lot for it.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
So I guess it's that's like. And what do you what do you expect?

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
You're getting a vanilla program for vanilla dollars. Yes, exactly.

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
So it's just all right. Well, for all the people that roll their eyes when you start to go off on Nintendo, I think they will take.

07:27.000 --> 07:37.000
And it was OK. It was it wasn't like I didn't have high expectations and they met those non high expectations, I guess.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
I don't know what to basically say. I mean, so they announced games, so they had lots of different things.

07:42.000 --> 07:50.000
Three DS games that, you know, Kirby's extra epic yarn. They had Luigi's Mansion three coming to the switch.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
They talked a little bit about the new update for Splatoon two.

07:55.000 --> 08:02.000
Mario Tennis Aces was getting DLC. They are remastering New Super Mario Brothers U.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
OK, well, we're like machine gunning this and I've got so much to say.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.000
No, that's OK. So Splatoon two, I didn't really I my my feed kind of hiccuped, so I didn't really see everything.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Is it true that this is their battle royale update?

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
That's like if I know I didn't watch any of that part.

08:17.000 --> 08:25.000
So, OK, then I need the help of our chatters over at live dot vog network dot com because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network,

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
vog network dot com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
And part of the fun of doing the show live is that we have a chat room to give us their call.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Steer us when we go adrift.

08:36.000 --> 08:43.000
They were, I know, changing up some stuff, how they do Splat Fest to go along with this as well.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
So once that online service comes.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Dartetsuya straight up says, yeah, I wasn't sure what that was about TBH.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
The parts of the trailer I saw were really kind of abstract, like it didn't really explain what was new.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
And one of my buddies was the one that told me that it was like a battle royale update.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
But I don't know if that was just that's what I want or if it's what what I read somewhere.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
Yeah. Nifty asks, where's Flacco? He's the Splatoon expert. He's a podcast listener.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
He's probably shouting the answer in his car right now.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
Like I know one of the things I think they changed with the Splat Fest.

09:15.000 --> 09:21.000
It's now they have kind of like a casual and competitive mode for the Splat Fest.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
So they split it up that way as well.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
I don't know. I'm not in the Splatoon, so I didn't pay attention to it. Plus I came in late.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
I was walking. I walk now. Apparently that's the thing I do.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
OK, I'm actually loading Nintendo's site to see what the heck's going on.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
They're saying new weapons set that are part of the Kensa collections.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
The whole Splat Fest refresh that you're talking about.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
New sub and special weapons are also on the way.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
So this doesn't say anything about the whole battle royale.

09:50.000 --> 09:57.000
But it says that Splatoon will have two new modes, normal and pro, that replace the solo and team modes and all that.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
And normal means you go into a Splat Fest battle on your own.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
And if it's, yeah, if you go into pro, then what is this?

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
You get into, where is this? No, it's talking about the ink. That's still just talking about the casual mode.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Oh, pro is for you want to go solo and push themselves to the limit.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
You're judging your Splat Fest power. You can get into the top 100.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
So that sounds like something that Flaco will be going for over on his stream.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
So, cheap plug for Flaco Jones over on Twitch. Flaco underscore Jones.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
I don't think I've seen him not stream Splatoon in a long time.

10:29.000 --> 10:35.000
Alright, well that's cool for the people that are still turning away at Splatoon. That's cool to see what the game's still getting love.

10:35.000 --> 10:41.000
They did talk about the NES classic games that they're going to have on there.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
Yeah, cool. I saw some really cool stuff in there.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
River City Ransom. I don't remember that in the first list of 10.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
Yeah, I mean it looks nice. It's a nice interface and everything. They're going to have online play for some of those as well.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
This really does feel like what we should have had on the Wii.

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
Yeah, or like the NES classic system.

11:01.000 --> 11:10.000
And then if you want to get in on that NES classic gaming and you want to get some Joy-Con controllers that look like NES controllers,

11:10.000 --> 11:17.000
you can do that if you subscribe to the service and it's going to be one per account that gets to purchase those.

11:17.000 --> 11:24.000
Do you think this is an anti-scalping measure? Because as an anti-scalping measure, I've seen a lot of hate for this on the internet,

11:24.000 --> 11:30.000
but as an anti-scalping measure, I'm like, yes, finally Nintendo's doing something about all the scalping of their products.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
Maybe, but they probably think, well you don't need it if you're not paying for the service.

11:35.000 --> 11:42.000
I guess. Although you know what the twist is, if you have a family plan, because you know some people were talking about doing family plan pools,

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
because family plans can be shared and I don't know, I think it was like seven accounts or something.

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
Some people were talking about doing the family plan. You can't get more than one with the family plan.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
So if you go into one of these pools with five other people, only one of you is getting those NES controllers if you want it.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
I don't know.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
That's what eBay's for.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
If you buy it and you're like, I don't want this shit, and then you're like, how am I gonna sell it for $400?

12:06.000 --> 12:15.000
I don't know if I really need those controllers. I mean, it's like saying that the Joy-Cons are bad for playing.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I think the Joy-Cons are fine.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
Most likely I'm not playing Nintendo games over the internet with people. That's not what I'm gonna use the service for.

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
This is where you and I are different. I'm gonna use this a lot. I hope. I hope there's people that want to play this game.

12:28.000 --> 12:35.000
If I'm gonna spend $60 on those controllers, I might as well just buy a fucking NES classic because what's the fucking point at that point?

12:35.000 --> 12:44.000
This is why I want my Twitch stream to work. Because I think playing something like River City Ransom with Bobby or my buddy Delvin or something online would be a lot of fun.

12:44.000 --> 12:53.000
Because then we can laugh and hoot and holler when one of the characters goes barf with the exclamation point as they do in River City Ransom.

12:53.000 --> 13:02.000
So, I'm really looking forward to the online thing. I've been waiting like 10 years to play Virtual Console games online, so this part is super exciting to me.

13:02.000 --> 13:16.000
I mean, sure, I wish there were Super Nintendo games. I wish there were N64 games. I wish there was more. I wish this wasn't being drip-fed, but it's something. I'll take it.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
You know what? It's better than nothing. This is what we have today.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
I still don't understand what their fucking app does.

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
For a lot of people, nothing. And I think that's part of the reason why some people...

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
Well, you know this whole online thing when Nintendo's getting a lot of hate online? People are like,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Why is Nintendo charging this money?

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
Well, for one, Nintendo warned you this was coming. I mentioned this on the last OLR we did.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
It's on the back of every Switch game that's online.

13:46.000 --> 13:52.000
It says it's free until the launch of Nintendo's online system, which was supposed to be like summer.

13:52.000 --> 13:59.000
Like last year. I don't have a Switch game in front of me, but I'm pretty sure a lot of those disclaimers are like,

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
It was supposed to be pay a long time ago. This whole thing has just been a courtesy extension or whatever.

14:04.000 --> 14:10.000
So, I don't know. What are you getting with Xbox Live and PlayStation Plus?

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
Free games. Like free new games. Like recent games.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
Okay. And to be fair, Nintendo's service is a hell of a lot cheaper.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
It's $20 a year versus $50.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
But you're getting a lot more full-price games.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
I understand that you're paying less, but you're getting less.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
But that's okay. I don't see where the problem is to complain about that.

14:33.000 --> 14:44.000
My thing with it is, Nintendo I think values the value that they see their NES games, their old NES games,

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
is higher than what I perceive them to be.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
I think they should be much cheaper.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
Should never have been charging $5 a piece for that shit. Never.

14:55.000 --> 15:02.000
And so they feel that it's, oh, you're getting such a value because they're like $5, $8 a piece.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
Whereas in reality, maybe not so much.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
I mean, great, yeah. Super Mario Bros. 3, great fucking game.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
But it's been a great fucking game for decades now.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
And it's old. It's old. It is.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
And that is still a great game.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
But dude, like fucking new movies that come out,

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
like movies that are decades old aren't necessarily being,

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
they're not priced at the same as a brand new blockbuster movie that just came out.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
It's because that shit's been out forever and the demand for it isn't as high.

15:34.000 --> 15:40.000
Granted, people like being nostalgic and they bought the NES classic systems and stuff like that.

15:40.000 --> 15:46.000
And I'm sure this will be popular for a while, but it's not the same as getting like Switch games.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
Like, you know, if they offered, you know, even though I don't fucking want it,

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
hey, 1-2 Switch is the free game this month or something like that.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
You know, like an actual Switch game.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
Yeah, but then that would be a steal if they were charging $20 bucks a year.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Not a month, Loki. A year.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
If they were charging $20 bucks a year and giving you stuff on that level,

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
then like that would be, Nintendo would be like losing money on it.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
That's why they can't, they could charge more for it if they offered more as a service.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Oh yeah, I see. All right, I get what you're getting.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
But they're not because they don't have it there because they're,

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
this is kind of like fucking Little League shit, you know?

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
So that's fine. Let's, let's let them take baby steps into it.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
I'm glad that they're actually doing an online service fucking decades late, but whatever.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
I don't remember free games being a part of Xbox Live back on the 360.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
So, you know, it took them time to grow too.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
I just think a lot of people had the expectation that Nintendo was going to mirror.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Here's what I think happened.

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
I think a lot of people had the expectation that Nintendo was going to mirror what Xbox Live and PlayStation do.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Meaning you're going to be able to, like, people, I swear,

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
I think there were people out there that was expecting this Direct to be like,

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
now you can stream your games online through the Switch.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
You can do SharePlay with a friend through the Switch.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
You can have trophies and achievements that get online.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Like people are just straight up making shit up.

17:00.000 --> 17:06.000
Why they can't just have like, okay, these NES games have the multiplayer component to them.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
And, you know, later on other NES games could get that multiplayer update as well.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
But for now, you can still play them, but they're single player or you can play them on the local co-op.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Why can't they do that?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
You wanted that avalanche of like a hundred NES games.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Why can't they do that? Because they could have totally done that.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
It's just that they're like, no, no, no.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
We need to make sure that we get them all happening in multiplayer.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
You know what? There's one player NES games out there.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
There's plenty of one player NES games, fucking Legend of Zelda.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
I'm sure that's part of it, but that doesn't need fucking two players in it.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
There's lots of one player NES games that you just throw up there.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
Don't tell me you can't fucking run on that because homebrew runs that shit.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
Okay, Orange Right in our chat at live.vognetware.com says,

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
it's good that there is an import and a game that was never on the Virtual Console in the first year.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
They didn't wait until 2019.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
Granted, it's Twinbee and Pro Wrestling, but still, and not to insult Twinbee.

17:55.000 --> 18:01.000
Okay, well, that is neat that at least there is, I mean, Pro Wrestling was not that good of a game.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
And that's not me slamming wrestling.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Like there was a WrestleMania game on NES that was cool,

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
but Nintendo's Pro Wrestling game was like not that good.

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
But it is still neat that, you know, it's there,

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
and it's something that you can make a decision for yourself on if it's good or not.

18:17.000 --> 18:23.000
And the thing that is actually kind of cool about this whole Nesflix-style system that they have

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
is that if you play it and decide after 30 seconds you don't like it,

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
well, it came with your subscription to play Mario Kart online anyway.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
So, I mean, I don't know, I'm kind of, I'm into it.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
Like, I, you know, we knew Nintendo was going to be charging for online.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
It's not that expensive, all things considered.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
I'll probably just plop down for a year up front,

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
and now I'll have these NES games I can play on friends of mine.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
I think it's going to be cool.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I'm going to do that as well because it's not expensive,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
and because I need to if I ever want to play online, although I have not.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
It would have been fantastic if Reggie came out of that direct and said,

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
100 NES classics and 50 Super Nintendo classics all out the gate,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
and you get a game, and you get a game, and you get a game.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
But, you know what, this is the more realistic approach. It's fine.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
We all knew Nintendo was going to drip-feed it.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
I just wanted to keep the pace up.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
If they're going to add three more to the pot every month, like their show,

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
like, keep that up for five years.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
You know what I mean?

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
Make sure you have that plan to keep this going for years,

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
because I imagine, you know, and I'm okay with, okay,

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
and then when they run out of NES games, let's say in a year's time,

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
that they want to do, now the Super Nintendo games start coming,

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
and then the N64 or whatever they decide to do.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
But it's very obvious that they're not looking to do everything,

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
or we wouldn't have things like this SNK collection, the Sega Ages.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Like, this is not going to go down the same path, or arcade archives.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
This is not going to go down the same path as Virtual Console.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Nintendo is keeping this Nintendo.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
I think it's a given we'll get Super Nintendo eventually.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
I just hope, one more thing I'm going to say about this,

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
I just hope it doesn't go the whole DS route where it's,

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
well, you need the new 3DS to play this, because you all know,

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
we all know, we all know there will be a Switch Deluxe of some sort.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
It will happen.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
Maybe not next year, but, you know, around the time that PlayStation

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
and Sony and Microsoft are starting to show off what's next for them,

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Nintendo's going to be like,

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
well, how about the power of the Switch Deluxe?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
And now you can play Super Nintendo games,

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
but only through the power of the Switch Deluxe.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
To which I'll tell them, fuck your stupid, super whatever Switch game.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Be prepared. Be prepared.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
That shit can fucking play Wii games now, okay?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
I know, it should. It should fucking.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
It is playing Wii U games.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
This is about as stupid as saying Sony's PlayStation 4

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
can't fucking handle PlayStation 1 games.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
It's goddamn retarded.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
It's just, you can't say that intelligently.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
It's dumb.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
The system can fucking handle Super Nintendo games.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Alright, let's move on.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
What else did we have, Logie?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Anyways.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
Katamari reroll, so they're re-remastering that again.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Okay, yay. I'm very happy about that.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Because the last time it came out was remastered,

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
so it's fucking remastered yet again.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
You know what, though? I seem to recall,

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
the first two games were the good ones,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
and then it didn't get very good after that,

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
because I don't think the guy who created Katamari was with it anymore,

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
and so they started to kind of, you know, roll off the rails a little bit.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
So, I'm okay with a remaster of the first game. I really am.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
It's been long enough.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Let's revisit it in glorious widescreen.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
I'm imagining it's a down...

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Oh no, maybe they are going to release it as a cartridge.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
But whatever. I'm in.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
It's Katamari.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Well, yeah. I have to get it.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Yeah, I know, right?

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
I'm just disappointed that it's not new,

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
because it needs to be new.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
I'm sorry, I'm screaming over here.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
SSG100Matt in chat says,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Last time Katamari was this big in the news,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
OLR was in trouble over it.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Truth.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
It's true, yeah.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
How quickly we forget the Vita game.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
How quickly we forget there was a Katamari launch game on the Vita.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Alright, anyway.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Was it Touch My Katamari?

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Maybe. I don't remember what it was called.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Yeah, probably.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
It was not very good, from what I remember.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
It was okay.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
But yeah, I mean, it just, you know,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
it wasn't enough to keep the Katamari games,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
or games in general, coming on the Vita.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Alright, so yay, Katamari. What else?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
And then, of course,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
they were showing off

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
the new fighter for Smash Brothers.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
And, of course,

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
coming from Animal Crossing.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
And then, of course,

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Animal Crossing itself.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
So there was the fake tease that,

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
oh hey, it's just an Animal Crossing character, fighter, and...

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
But then, oh ho ho!

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
There's also Animal Crossing.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Yeah. And Tom Nook.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
I was hoping Tom Nook would be the fighter, but you know.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Yeah, I actually thought it would be a reveal

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
that Tom Nook was like a shadow character.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
That would have been kind of rad.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
As if I'm poo-pooing the news of a new Animal Crossing.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
No, that's very exciting.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
But, you know, like literally two minutes before the direct,

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I wrote this tweet that was like,

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
I can't live tweet the direct,

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
because I need my phone to be able to watch it.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
So, you know, lower those expectations.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
Don't expect them to announce a new Animal Crossing.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
And then, of course, when that first trailer started,

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
I was like, aw, motherfucker.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
They're going to announce Animal Crossing right after I wrote that tweet.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
I pretty, like, she says something like,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
the mayor's away or something.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
She says something where it's very obvious,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
oh, she's going to reveal that she's in Smash.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
Of course, Isabel in Smash rumors were out there months ago,

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
you know, and it's a very logical character to add to the game.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
So, of course.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
And then I was like, oh, okay.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
So that's what they're announcing.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Wow, what a troll.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
This is an epic troll.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
And then the second trailer started,

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
and the disclaimer came up again on the screen,

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
may not reflect actual gameplay.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
And that's when I knew, oh, this is an actual Animal Crossing reveal.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
They just fucked my tweet.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
But you know what?

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
If I'm going to be wrong, that's the reason I want to be wrong.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
I'm never happier to be wrong than cases like that.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
I just, you know, I knew a new Animal Crossing game would happen someday.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Of course, one's going to happen.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
I just didn't think it would be this soon.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
I really did think Nintendo was going to focus on the mobile thing,

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
but maybe because the mobile version hasn't really taken off for them,

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
they decided, let's do this.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
So they had a new Game Freak game called Town.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
It's a working title.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
So that looked interesting.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
It all takes place within one town or something.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Oh, yeah.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
RPG.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
They had, what was it?

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy, and more Final Fantasy.

24:41.000 --> 24:47.000
Crystal Chronicles Remastered, Final Fantasy XV Pocket was out that day.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
World of Final Fantasy Maxima,

24:50.000 --> 24:56.000
Chocobo's Dungeon, Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy IX, Final Fantasy X, X-2,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
and Final Fantasy XII.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Sorry, no, VIII or VI.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Okay, here's, okay.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Can we talk about this for a minute?

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
Okay, first off, I am so here for the Chocobo Dungeon

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
and for Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Where's that Fox Chocobo racing?

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
That should have been the racing title that should have been highlighted there.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Where's my Chocobo racing remaster?

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
I'm not going to disagree.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
So here's what's obviously happening.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
Square Enix is taking all of their PC ports that they've done recently

25:22.000 --> 25:28.000
and are going back into Unity or whatever and export to Switch.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
Obviously, I'm very much oversimplifying what really happens.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
I know that.

25:33.000 --> 25:38.000
But we know they're taking their PC ports and basically now porting them over to Switch

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
because it shouldn't be that difficult.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
Especially like the X and X-2, those were on PlayStation 3,

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
as was Final Fantasy VII was a download title on PlayStation 4.

25:50.000 --> 25:55.000
I don't remember if IX was, but I know it was a PC title.

25:55.000 --> 26:00.000
So obviously they're dumping this whole library onto the Switch, which is cool.

26:00.000 --> 26:05.000
I mean, I got really excited seeing that Final Fantasy XII is on the Switch,

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
but then I'm like, I've already bought that game two times.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Once on PC, once on PlayStation 4.

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
I'm not going to buy it again on the Switch just to have it portable,

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
but I think it's great for the people that maybe only have a Switch at home

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
and not a PC strong enough to run it.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
That's cool for them.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
They'll finally get to play the game, yay.

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
But I find it fascinating just how much of the talk on Twitter is,

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
where's Final Fantasy VIII, though?

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Do you hate VIII?

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Where's Final Fantasy VIII?

26:35.000 --> 26:41.000
And I'm like, they just announced seven, nine, ten, ten, two, twelve.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
They announced five Final Fantasy games,

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
and you're complaining about the one that's not there.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
And here's the thing.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
Most people that are making that, I say most people,

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
because I know there's going to be somebody that pops up and says,

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
no, I'm very serious about my complaints.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Most people that are writing those tweets and complaining

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
Nintendo hates Final Fantasy VIII or whatever the hell they're saying out there,

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
would probably not buy it anyway,

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
and are not going to buy seven or nine, which are very similar.

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
And this goes beyond, look, I know you all know I don't care for Final Fantasy VIII.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
It is my least favorite Final Fantasy game.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
I said it. Deal with it.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
And the reason why, it's not the story.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
I get that y'all are tied to the story.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
It's not the story that upsets me.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
The story's fine.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
The story should have been the Final Fantasy movie they did.

27:27.000 --> 27:33.000
It's that draw junction thing completely ruins the gameplay for me.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Deal with it.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
But here's the thing.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
I don't understand.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
Finally, after all these years, we can say Final Fantasy VII is on a Nintendo system.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Who would have thought we would ever see the day?

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
But yet everybody just wants to complain.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
But where's VIII?

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
Well, did you think that maybe if you support some of these other games,

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
maybe there will be incentive to do VIII?

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
Maybe VIII was not as portable.

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
Because, again, they just recently did VII on PlayStation 4.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
I'm not talking about the remake.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
I'm talking about, remember at the PlayStation experience a couple years ago,

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
they announced Final Fantasy VII available today.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
And it had that audience reaction of the stone faces

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
because it was the old Final Fantasy VII.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
So that is what is going on the Switch as is, you know, X, X-2, X-12.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
We all know what we're getting with that.

28:20.000 --> 28:25.000
So it's just, you know, for whatever reason VIII just isn't as easily portable.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
But if these other Final Fantasy games do well,

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
then I would imagine they're going to have the incentive to maybe go back

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
and do some of these other Final Fantasy games,

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
which would include, yes, maybe VIII.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
I kind of don't want them to do Final Fantasy V and VI

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
if they're just going to slap those mobile ports that are on Steam

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
over to the Switch because those games deserve better.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
But, you know, we'll see what happens.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
I think it's still exciting to have Square Enix games,

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
Final Fantasy games and all this coming out on the Switch this much.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
I'm here for Crystal Chronicles and Chocobo Dungeon.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
The rest of them, I've already bought them,

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
so I don't see myself buying them again just to have them portable.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
That's it.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
Anyway, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
YYR says, hold up, I have a question.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
Did they announce the Final Fantasy VII remake for Switch

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
or just an old port of Final Fantasy VII?

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
No, not the remake, just old port.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Yeah, it's not going to be able to run the remake.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
That's why Final Fantasy XV looks the way it does.

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
Yeah, so, well, the Final Fantasy XV has been out on phones for forever.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
That's why I'm nervous that they're going to just do V and VI

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
and that terrible chrono tribute PC thing next.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
I know, it's so weird that the Switch runs mobile games quite well.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
You know what else runs on mobile platforms?

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
Fucking Super Nintendo games, that's right!

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Alright, anyway.

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
SST100Matt says, I just found it funny that they so obviously skipped VIII.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
I also don't like Final Fantasy VIII, but I mean,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
just because they didn't announce it now,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
doesn't mean they won't come out with it later.

29:58.000 --> 30:04.000
I mean, the big oversight of VIII, when it's like 7, 9, 10,

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
we all know why they don't do XI, it's online,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
and XII, you know, it's like, there's very obviously-

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
No, I don't know why they don't do XI.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Why isn't XI on the Switch?

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
Fair enough, but there's very obviously a number missing in that sequence,

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
which for me, when I'm not a big fan of Final Fantasy VIII,

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
is great for trolling tweets, but I'm not really trying to be an asshole.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Like, I'll get my one little troll tweet out of my system,

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
and then it's like, but, you know, for those that like VIII,

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
I do hope it comes out eventually.

30:29.000 --> 30:36.000
And from what I understand, the PC version did allow you to draw 99 Magics or something.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
Like, there was a cheat built into it, so that if you hated the system like I do,

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
it made it a lot easier, but it's like, but the system's still there in the first place.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
You even have to draw one still, it's bleh.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Anyway.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
I think it'll go okay for him.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
I might buy Final Fantasy IX only because I haven't bought it a second time yet.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Well, there you go.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Fifth Dream says, I love VIII.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
I thought I was the only one, though.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Not if you check Twitter.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Not if you check Twitter.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
You would think the whole world VIII is their favorite.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
I was like, where were you people to fight me earlier?

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Anyway.

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
All right, so Final Fantasy Galore from Square Enix, that's pretty cool.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
And then of course they showed Daemon Ex Machina,

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
which is the kind of armored core spiritual successor type thing.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Oh yeah, that looked interesting.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Civ VI.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Yay!

31:26.000 --> 31:32.000
And it didn't look like it was a cartoonified Civ Revolution type thing,

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
which actually I love Civ Revolution, so I wouldn't even care if it was that.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
But it looks like it really is just Civ VI, but on the Switch.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
So that's pretty cool.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
And then Yoshi's Crafted World.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
That looked cute.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Yeah, it looked neat.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Yeah.

31:46.000 --> 31:51.000
I mean, obviously it's a throwback to Super Mario World II, Yoshi's Island.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
And there's been a few other games inspired by that since,

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
like the yarn Yoshi Wooly World or whatever that was.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Yeah.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
So.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
That's all I can think of.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
All right.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
And then, what was I going to say?

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
They had a fighting game collection, or not fighting game,

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
like an arcade brawler collection that was from Capcom.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Oh yeah.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
I was like, oh yeah, the Final Fight and all those games.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
You know what's interesting, and we should talk about this,

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
a lot of those announcements were not unique to Switch.

32:22.000 --> 32:27.000
That beat-em-up collection is coming out on PlayStation, pretty much everything.

32:27.000 --> 32:32.000
The Final Fantasy ports, as the Nintendo Direct is going on,

32:32.000 --> 32:37.000
Major Nelson puts out a tweet that says, hey, guess what?

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
We've got all these Final Fantasy games coming out on Xbox soon.

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
And they're getting all the same stuff except they don't have Pocket Edition

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
or Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon for whatever reason.

32:48.000 --> 32:53.000
But like the 7, the 9, the 10, 10, 2, 12, all of that is also on Xbox.

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
It was just funny because it was very much a, hey, over here you guys,

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
over here, me too, you guys, us over here, I'm cool too.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
Don't forget your Xbox, we love you.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
It was just kind of a funny moment on Twitter.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
I don't know.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
It struck me as just kind of funny that Microsoft was like, we're cool too.

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
But the thing with Microsoft, and maybe this speaks to the state

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
of where I'm at with my Xbox One, I don't know.

33:19.000 --> 33:24.000
I thought the 10 and 10, 2, and Final Fantasy 12,

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
I thought all of that was already on Xbox One.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
I didn't realize Xbox One was skipped over on that stuff.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
I thought it was already there.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Yeah, I didn't realize that.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
So I guess that's why they're happy to finally have them.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
I don't know.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
So anyway.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
SHO 100 Matt says, Capcom beat-em-up collection.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
That looked cool, and you can do online co-op play.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
Well, you'll notice a lot of stuff in that Direct,

33:50.000 --> 33:55.000
the common theme was online stuff capped with Animal Crossing,

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
which is Nintendo's one of their biggest online games,

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
next to Smash and stuff.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
But that's a big franchise that people are going to want to play online

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
in some capacity.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
I mean, we'll find out next year what Animal Crossing will let you do online.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
But in the meantime, Nintendo, besides Smash,

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
which they didn't really talk about, which I actually think made people happy.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Yes, there was the Isabelle reveal,

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
but outside of that, they didn't really talk about Smash Brothers,

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
and I think that's what people were hoping for,

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
is that we wanted to hear about some other stuff.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
But I think a lot of the games they did talk about,

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
they really relied on some of the third-party stuff.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
You have a lot of online stuff.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
Like, there's a reason why the focus from Square out the gate

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
was Crystal Chronicles remaster,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
because that's the one you're going to play online,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
not seven, not nine.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Online is the Crystal Chronicles remaster.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Diablo 3 was brought up again,

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
which we knew that that was probably originally going to be

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
part of some type of Nintendo online announcement.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
But they announced it for Gamescom, and now we got this instead.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
But they still talked about it to remind us that

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Diablo 3 is going to be online.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
And then they showed us that

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
that Deus Machina thing looked very online,

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
shooter-y type of thing, too.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
So I'm surprised they didn't give us an update on Fortnite

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
or something on top of all this stuff.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Fortnite doesn't use it.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Oh yeah, that's right. That's right.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
We didn't mention Fortnite during the online presentation,

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
because it doesn't need it.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Fortnite doesn't need it.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
I still think Nintendo should have snuck it in there as a

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
this is the system to play Fortnite on you guys,

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
because, Loki, everybody's playing Fortnite.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
Everybody is playing Fortnite.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
So I went on a random trip to San Francisco this weekend,

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
and we went by the Microsoft store at the big mall there downtown,

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
ironically not far from the Metreon,

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
which used to be Sony's big thing.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
But we were at the Microsoft store there,

35:45.000 --> 35:49.000
and what is on all the laptops and all the game consoles,

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
and what are people playing that they could probably be playing on their phones

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
or they're playing Fortnite? They're all playing Fortnite.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
And we were in the Razer store.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
And in the Razer store, what's being demoed on the computers?

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
Fortnite. I mean, Fortnite is the game right now.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
But it's, I mean, if this had been four or five years ago,

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
it would have been Minecraft.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
You know, it's just, it's the hot shit of the moment.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
So I'm just, I'm really surprised that Nintendo did not try to drop

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
a Fortnite thing in there somewhere. That's all.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
That's the only thing with online, I'm just kind of surprised.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
But otherwise, I like the Direct myself.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
I thought there was a lot of good stuff in there.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
So, kudos Nintendo.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Even though they had to push it back a week,

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
you know, because of the hurricane that happened,

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
I totally respect, but I respect what they had to do.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
That's totally fine.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
And interesting the effect that that had, though,

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
because the Civ 6 thing got leaked early because of that,

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
because, you know, somebody had a scheduled post

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
over at 2K or something to go up,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
and it still went up even though the Direct got delayed.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
So we all knew about Civ 6 a week early.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
And then, you know, other little things, you know,

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
kind of started trickling out.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
So it was just interesting to watch that effect

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
of what happened with the delay.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
But certainly I understand why Nintendo delayed it.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Yeah.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
And it gave us something to talk about this week.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
All right, so anything else with the Nintendo Direct we need to talk about?

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
How about you guys in chat over at live.vognetwork.com?

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
They also mentioned, of course, you know,

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
there's this save, special, you know,

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
cloud saves that you can do.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
One thing, though, about that, though,

37:23.000 --> 37:27.000
is if you stop subscribing to the service, you lose the cloud saves.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
And you might not be able to get that stuff back.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Which, on the other platforms, there is a six month window

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
in which you can access those.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Oh, that's good.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
You're just going to have to know to pull them down

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
before your thing expires.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
But you can't even back them up on a USB stick or anything.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
You have to pull them down to your system and hope your system doesn't fry.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
That's it.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
It's stupid.

37:47.000 --> 37:51.000
I think Nintendo could do a lot better with that.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
They're worried about being hacked is what it is.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Too late! It's fucking too late for that.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Just who cares at this point?

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Yeah. All right.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Before we get into our gaming weeks,

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
I want to talk a little bit about Dragon Con, actually.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
So Dragon Con was so much fun. It was great.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
I got to do a variety of panels.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
I talked about all the panels I was going to moderate on the last show,

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
but I did a panel with Mass Effect voice actors.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
That was kind of the first big gaming related thing that I did.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
And that was really cool.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Even though the game is old at this point,

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
I mean, I say it's old because Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
are like ten and eight years old.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
These titles are aging.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
There's still so much love for the series.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
Mass Effect Andromeda only came up once,

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
to which the question asker was quickly reminded.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
None of the people at the panel had anything to do with Andromeda.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
So I actually kind of jumped in.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
I see my role as moderator to kind of deflect some of the questions

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
from the celebrities when maybe it's something they don't want to get into.

38:48.000 --> 38:53.000
So as the moderator, I kind of said my piece about Andromeda.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
I think a lot of us were, and I've said it here on the show,

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
a lot of us were really rooting for that game, and it came out,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
maybe it could have had a little more time in the oven,

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
and it's unfortunate they weren't given that time.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
And the audience gave the applause that they agreed and all that stuff.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
And we moved on from that, because that's that.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
But lots of other, it's cool to hear about their other projects and things.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
Courtney Taylor, who voices Jack in the game,

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
she works with this organization called Nerds Vote

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
that registers people to vote at conventions.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
So I wanted to give that a shout out.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Hopefully at some point I can get her or somebody else

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
that works on that project here on the show to talk about that.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
I would love to do that at a later date,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
before the elections in November, obviously.

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
So a reminder, register to vote if you haven't already.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
So that was really cool.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
And then I did a panel with the voice actors

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
from Five Nights at Freddy's, sister location,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
where we actually played through the game.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
I didn't play, thankfully.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
A Twitch streamer, her name is Panina Chan, shout out.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
She did the actual playthrough.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
They're live with the voice actors,

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
and it was actually a lot of fun because the whole audience,

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
I did not realize how many kids are in Five Nights at Freddy's.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
Boy, did I underestimate how many kids are in Five Nights at Freddy's.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
There's a new hotness on there, too, now.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
My son's totally into ink.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Was it, God, what the fuck is it?

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Something in the ink machine.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
I don't remember what it's called, but it's basically like,

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
I think Mickey Mouse, but Five Nights at Freddy's.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Oh, no.

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
It's like, it's your child's first horror game.

40:20.000 --> 40:26.000
So, yeah, I knew some kids were into it, but I was kind of surprised

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
that that was very much a family panel of people that showed up there.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
It was like a lot of mixed ages there.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
So, anyway, you know, we were playing through the game,

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
and the voice actors are fun.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
We had some technical difficulties at the beginning,

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
so we just did a little bit of light bantering and did some audience questions.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
A couple things struck me.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
One, the voice actors, I mean, they were all great.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
They were all gracious, obviously.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
They're all very young, which is interesting when I'm like,

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
wow, you're like maybe 24 tops, and you've accomplished so much more

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
in your life than I have, but I thought they were great.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
They were so professional and everything,

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
and they were messing with the audience.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
There's this really tense thing where you're crawling through the air vents,

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
and then at one point, Kellen, who does the voice of Freddy Fazbear,

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
actually just did the voice very loudly in the mic and scared the audience,

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
and that was really funny.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
We all had a laugh.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
And then, of course, I don't know if she did it on purpose,

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
but we knew this had to happen at some point.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
Penina Chan triggered a jump scare, and the whole audience was just like, ah!

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
And so that was a lot of fun, and of course,

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
the voice actors are giggling like crazy because they're all into it

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
and think it's funny, and I think one of them was actually legit scared, too,

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
because, you know, it's a scary game.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
So I was even kind of looking away.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Bobby Blackwolf was really cool.

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
He came to all my panels, even though he wasn't necessarily co-hosting them,

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
but he was kind of like my emotional support kitten for all these different panels.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
He's looking away from the screen like,

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
I know something bad is going to happen.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
I'm not going to look at this.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
I'm just not going to look at it.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
So that was a lot of fun.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
No, nothing came up on the movie.

41:53.000 --> 41:57.000
I think somebody asked a question to them about did they want to be involved,

41:57.000 --> 42:02.000
and you can imagine it was like, yes, we would love to be involved with the movie.

42:02.000 --> 42:08.000
Please call us was kind of the direction that we got.

42:08.000 --> 42:12.000
But sadly for them, I think some of these roles will probably go to,

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
you know, the typical movie actors you hear,

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
but hopefully they'll get to be involved in some way or another.

42:17.000 --> 42:23.000
And then I did a Twitch 101 panel with one of the engineers from Twitch,

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
and she was great.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
She was really nice, and we had a really good panel, really productive.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
It was 101, so I was talking about Twitch, like, what is Twitch?

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
But there was a lot of people in the audience who had no knowledge of Twitch,

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
so I thought that was really cool.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
And there were, of course, some affiliates and people of all levels in there,

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
but I think even for those people it was a really good networking opportunity

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
to meet other live streamers and stuff.

42:44.000 --> 42:49.000
And even I learned, like, I had no idea Twitch had a whole creators' camp online

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
that helps you learn how to do this stuff, so I thought that was really cool.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
So that was a really productive panel.

42:54.000 --> 42:59.000
And then the last panel I did from the video game track was probably the biggest.

42:59.000 --> 43:04.000
I did the Overwatch voice actors, and that was a huge ballroom

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
that was wired with cameras because that's one of the ballrooms

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
that can go on Dragon Con TV, which if you've never been to Dragon Con,

43:11.000 --> 43:16.000
Dragon Con TV is available in all the host hotels in your room during the convention,

43:16.000 --> 43:22.000
and they air select panels on Dragon Con TV so you can watch them in your room

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
so you don't have to try to go stand in line or whatever for these panels.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
So if they have a big, like, John Barrowman, every year John Barrowman's there

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
and has a panel, it'll be on Dragon Con TV, right?

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
So if you want to watch that in your room, you can.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Now, my panel was not on Dragon Con TV.

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
I don't know if it's on the online version, it might be, I don't know,

43:38.000 --> 43:43.000
but I think what happens is that if one of the other panels has a technical difficulty,

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
they will revert to something else.

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
So I think we might have been the B panel because all of our stuff was labeled.

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
You may be, like, what you don't see on the front of the card has my name on it.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
On the back of the card, what I'm looking at, has a little thing that says,

43:57.000 --> 44:03.000
smile, you might be on Dragon Con TV, and kind of like a reminder about language and stuff.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Don't pick your fucking nose.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
Yeah, pretty much.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
How'd you know? Don't pick your fucking nose.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
No, it didn't say that.

44:10.000 --> 44:15.000
But anyway, Bobby Blackwell says it is most likely on the online version.

44:15.000 --> 44:19.000
So I guess we'll have to, maybe I'll have to pony up the ten bucks and check that out.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
I don't know, but here's the funny thing.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
I know a bootleg is out there because I searched YouTube when I got home

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
and there was a bootleg of the panel out there.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
So it was big enough to be bootlegged.

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
But all those voice actresses were, and it was all women,

44:32.000 --> 44:38.000
because they were all the voice actresses of Diva, Symmetra, and Mercy were there.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
And they were all super nice and great.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
And the questions, there was a really, really good question.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
And, like, let me tell you this.

44:46.000 --> 44:51.000
Like, I have to be professional as a moderator and try very hard not to be a big fanboy.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
But I was about to, let me tell you when I was about to, like,

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
just jump up and give one of these people a hug.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
Anjali, who does the voice of Symmetra,

44:59.000 --> 45:05.000
she got a question about what would be the charity skin that you would do?

45:05.000 --> 45:09.000
Because, like, Mercy had the breast cancer awareness skin, right?

45:09.000 --> 45:13.000
So the question was, what would be the skin that you would want to do and what would it look like?

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
And Anjali's answer said, well, I think it would be very obvious that Symmetra's

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
should do something for an autism charity and autism awareness.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
And, you know, she wanted her charity to be that.

45:24.000 --> 45:29.000
And she wanted the skin for Symmetra to be something that was like a world or global

45:29.000 --> 45:36.000
and something that was very inclusive because autism isn't always something that you see.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
There's all these different levels.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
There's all these types of people that are dealing with all different levels of autism.

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
And it's an issue that can affect so many people.

45:45.000 --> 45:51.000
And she had such an eloquent answer that I'm not really relaying appropriately here on this program.

45:52.000 --> 45:56.000
I'm not giving that answer the eloquence that she gave it.

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
But I really just want to jump up and give her a big hug and say that was like the best answer

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
you could have possibly given to that question.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
And I was moved by that.

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
So that was my favorite part of that whole panel, by the way, if you're curious,

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
was that particular question and answer.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
NSG100Matt says, yeah, that was well thought out.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
Make it happen, Blizzard. Yes, I agree.

46:16.000 --> 46:21.000
So anyway, yeah, that was a great panel.

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
And then I didn't even really talk about it.

46:24.000 --> 46:29.000
And just for time's sake, I probably won't get into it because that's a little more shop on the podcasting track.

46:29.000 --> 46:33.000
And the video game track stuff, with the exception of the ballroom panel,

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
if you weren't there, you can't see it.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
It wasn't taped or anything.

46:37.000 --> 46:42.000
But the podcasting track or now in the future digital media creation,

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
that all streamed on Facebook Live and all those panels are available to see on Facebook Live.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
So if you want to go check that out, and I encourage you to,

46:48.000 --> 46:53.000
you can check that out on the Digital Media Creators DragonCon page over on Facebook.

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
So yeah, lots of fun panels there as well.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
But anyway, I do want to move on for time's sake.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
I want to get into a little bit of our gaming weeks.

47:01.000 --> 47:06.000
And then I want to talk a little bit about one other thing that kind of traces back to DragonCon,

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
but it has to do with the future of OLR. I'll get to that in a minute.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Nothing bad. Don't worry.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Most of you already know what it is.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
Not everybody may have heard this yet if you're not listening to Bobby Blackwell

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
or you weren't following all the DragonCon news.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
So I want to get into that in just a minute.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
But first, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
And how was your gaming week, Loki?

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
I did play a few things.

47:25.000 --> 47:29.000
So I made it out to the arcade at one point to go.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
I had some time to kill.

47:31.000 --> 47:35.000
And so I went and played Danson's Revolution Ace.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
And so I got to play a little bit of that.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
Not very long, though, because I had to go pick up my kids.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
But I got to play through a few songs of that.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
And the interface is really confusing.

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
Luckily, the dude there spot me in games because he had put a ton of money into the machine,

47:49.000 --> 47:53.000
which is kind of bad form or whatever for games.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
So I got to play that a bit.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
And I don't know.

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
I don't understand necessarily the new step charts too much.

48:01.000 --> 48:08.000
New York Face is all right, but there's a definite change in how it is.

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
I like how everything kind of defaults to the solo arrows and stuff.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
So it's a little bit easier to see.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
I was going into the options and like, OK, I see speed options.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
Where's my arrow options that I'm used to on my extreme machine?

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Oh, it's not here.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
OK, well, fuck it. I'll just play without it.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Oh, hey, the arrows look like that anyway.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
So that was cool.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
So I played a couple games of that.

48:30.000 --> 48:34.000
And then I did download the demo for Mega Man 11.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
And I played through that.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
That was pretty fun.

48:38.000 --> 48:43.000
I also picked up a game that I talked about on Twitter before

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
called Old School Musical.

48:45.000 --> 48:51.000
And it's like a throwback to old school NES 16-bit games as well.

48:51.000 --> 48:58.000
And it's this whole story about these two creatures, Robin.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
I'm trying to remember the other guy's name.

49:01.000 --> 49:06.000
But anyways, they basically have to figure out what's going on

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
with this world that they're in.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
And so the whole game is played as a rhythm game.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
And so you kind of watch as they go through different levels

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
that are like a Mega Man level or Metal Gear level

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
or Metal Slug or something like that.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
And it's just kind of silly.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
They have this weird thing that has to do with glitches

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
and chickens and stuff like that.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
So I played through actually the whole game.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
I've already beaten it because it doesn't take too long to get through.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
It's only a rhythm game, so it's like two hours or so.

49:33.000 --> 49:39.000
But then they have this other part that's this chicken mode

49:39.000 --> 49:43.000
that you have to go through that you play through a bunch of songs.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
And that takes a lot longer, and it's a lot harder

49:45.000 --> 49:50.000
because they have modifiers that appear on your play field.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
So it makes it a lot harder to distract you

49:52.000 --> 49:57.000
or to make it harder to see the stuff that you're supposed to be doing.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
So, very funny game.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
They have lots of parodies for different things.

50:03.000 --> 50:11.000
I posted an image on Twitter where they have a Sydney parody that's Sid.

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
So it's an old man dressed up like Sidney from Final Fantasy XV.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Scantily clad and everything. It's hilarious.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
Nice.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
And like your characters several times.

50:20.000 --> 50:25.000
The younger brothers actually of these two guys is the larger of the two.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
And so it kind of throws you off a little bit,

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
but he keeps getting dressed in female clothing.

50:30.000 --> 50:33.000
Like in the Metal Gear level, he's dressed up like

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
oh god, I can't remember her name,

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
but Scantily clad like in Metal Gear Solid 5.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
Oh, Q or whatever her name was?

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
Quest. Quiet.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Quiet, yes. Dressed up like quiet.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Gender is a construct, tear it apart.

50:43.000 --> 50:48.000
It's just hilarious. It's funny, though, because he's talking about

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
why you keep getting dressed up like that.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
He's like, whatever, I'm working it.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Yes, bitch, slay!

50:54.000 --> 50:58.000
It's funny because he gets dressed up like Princess Zelda at one time.

50:58.000 --> 51:03.000
Oh yeah, there's one level you have to find this guy named Clint,

51:03.000 --> 51:07.000
which is obviously Link because the chickens have taken him away

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
for torturing chickens.

51:09.000 --> 51:13.000
So very tongue-in-cheek video game references in a don't sue me kind of way.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

51:15.000 --> 51:20.000
And a lot of the music, too, has kind of like throwbacks to those songs as well.

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
And they have a lot of cool stuff in there, so definitely go check it out.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
I picked it up on both platforms.

51:26.000 --> 51:30.000
I meant to play it on the Switch, and then my kids demanded I give them the Switch

51:30.000 --> 51:34.000
like immediately after I bought it, and I'm ready to play it and stuff.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
And then my son decides he's going to do homework sitting behind me.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
I'm like, motherfucker, you know?

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
How dare you do your homework?

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
How dare you do your homework?

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
And they're like, I want to play something on the Switch.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
I'm like, oh, god damn it, you know, so fine.

51:47.000 --> 51:52.000
So I had to buy it on PC, and I beat it through on PC, and I downloaded the...

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
They have some DLC for it as well, but it's like additional tracks.

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
It's all chiptunes, so it's pretty awesome.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
But definitely worth checking out.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
It gets pretty difficult, too, as you play through the game.

52:04.000 --> 52:08.000
And I'm only playing on normal, and there's a difficult mode as well that's even harder.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
So definitely worth checking out.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
It's a great game.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
You need a game, too, so that's pretty cool.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
And then, what else did I play?

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
I don't remember.

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
I think that was pretty much it.

52:23.000 --> 52:27.000
Yeah, just DDR Extreme at home.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
Yeah, I think that was it.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
I installed some other stuff.

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
Well, I played a lot of the LEGO Ninjago game,

52:35.000 --> 52:40.000
because my son keeps having me pass through different parts of that game for him.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
So I played a bit of that.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Oh, I remember.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
What else?

52:46.000 --> 52:50.000
I don't know if I played... I picked up Galaga and Double Peace because it was on sale.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
It's kind of a weird shooter game.

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
I played it on the Xbox 360 at one time,

52:56.000 --> 52:59.000
but I haven't gotten a chance to play through much of that.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
But it's just like I remember. It's just silly. Weird.

53:02.000 --> 53:06.000
Very innuendo.

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
Oh, and then I think I mentioned that I beat Donut Country.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
I don't remember.

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
No, we haven't been here for a little bit.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
Donut Country was another game. That's the one that's like Katamari.

53:17.000 --> 53:21.000
It's basically this raccoon that has this tablet,

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
and he opens a donut shop, and he thinks that he is...

53:25.000 --> 53:29.000
When people order a donut from him, he delivers a hole

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
that basically sucks up all their trash.

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
Which, to him, everything is trash.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
So he sucks up all their stuff.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
And so it's talking about this,

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
kind of flashing back to how they all ended up in this hole,

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
or donut.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
And so...

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
A donut hole?

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
Yeah, and so they...

53:50.000 --> 53:54.000
It's just a silly thing it has to do with the king of the raccoons and stuff like that.

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
It's just this weird game, but it's a little bit like Katamari,

53:57.000 --> 54:01.000
but a little bit more linear

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
because there's no real time limit.

54:03.000 --> 54:07.000
You just have this hole that gets bigger as you drop things into it,

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
and you have to solve some puzzles with that.

54:09.000 --> 54:13.000
Not a whole... It's not a very difficult game, but it's fun.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
It's got that kind of charm to it that Katamari has.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Wait, I have to know if this is a reference to the game.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
Puba in our chat room says,

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Loki, have a garbage day.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
Yes, that's...

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Okay, I was like, is that a reference to the game,

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
or did somebody just literally come into chat to tell you to have a bat?

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
Because either way, I'm okay with that comment.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Every level has the same thing.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
It's the raccoon thing. It's like, have a garbage day.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
Okay, okay, that's funny. I like that.

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
But also, have a garbage day.

54:40.000 --> 54:44.000
So that was it. Yeah, that was all I played this week.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Alright, let me talk about my gaming week.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
For my gaming week, I've done a lot.

54:48.000 --> 54:53.000
So when I was at Dragon Con, Bobby had his whole setup there at Dragon Con with VR.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
So he had the HTC Vive, which sadly not...

54:56.000 --> 55:00.000
I didn't play it as much this year as I did previous years,

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
but again, probably just because we were busy.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
I had eight panels and Bobby had six.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Granted, there was a little bit of overlap,

55:07.000 --> 55:12.000
but when he wasn't being my emotional support animal at my panels,

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
I was being his.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
So we were very busy.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
But we did get to do some VR playing,

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
and he had me play Beat Saber for the first time,

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
which I got to play on the HTC Vive.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
As a music game fan, I loved Beat Saber. It was so fun.

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
You would love this game, Loki, if you haven't checked it out.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
They are, and I think that's when most people will really get to check it out.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
But it was so fun.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
What's interesting about it,

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
and Bobby was explaining this to me because I didn't know this,

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
but did you know that it's not like DDR in the way that it grades you,

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
or like Beat Mini 2DX?

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
It's not 100% about when you smash the note,

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
but a lot of the flourish that you do...

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Like, did you just go...

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Did you just move your hand slightly to break it,

55:53.000 --> 55:57.000
or did you do a big, graceful swing of the sword

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
that followed through and broke it?

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Because if you do more movement, you get more points,

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
which I think is kind of neat.

56:03.000 --> 56:07.000
Of course, Perfect Attack, people are very upset about it

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
and write angry things on the internet,

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
but I think it's their game. They can do whatever they want.

56:12.000 --> 56:16.000
I think the flourishes go with a lot of the music that's in the game,

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
and it has a really cool movement to it.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
On one hand, I kind of wish you could have seen me play that.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
On the other hand, I'm very thankful that Bobby

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
did not try to livestream video of me playing that game

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
because it is still a little embarrassing,

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
but it's a lot of fun to play.

56:30.000 --> 56:35.000
It's like a must-have VR type of thing.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
And what's interesting is that at one of the panels

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
Bobby was doing, the point came up is that

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
could Beat Saber be done on a TV in a non-VR environment?

56:44.000 --> 56:49.000
And it's one of those, well, I mean, technically, sure.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
You could use your mouse and all that and play.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
It's not going to be the same thing at all.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Like the experience would not...

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Even with motion controllers, it would just not...

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
No, it really wouldn't. It really wouldn't.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
There's something about having it right in front of you

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
and really being able to see...

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Are you telling me I can't do this with Kinect?

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Because Kinect can do everything.

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
I'm thinking no. I'm thinking you're better off

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
not trying to do this in Kinect, so there you go.

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
And Bobby Blackwolf is in our chat and says,

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
you need the 3D positions of the visuals.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
It's not about the controls, but the visuals.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
And I would agree with that for sure.

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
So, yeah, that was Beat Saber. I really enjoyed it.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
It would be cool if maybe there was a few more songs,

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
but as I understand it, the game is in early access,

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
so that really shouldn't be a critical point at this time.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
I just hope that when they release on PlayStation,

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
maybe they'll get a few more songs.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
But all right, depending on how much they charge for it,

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
I'm sure it'll still be fine on VR.

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
Maybe they'll add more to it later, that whole time.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
That's probably what they've been doing,

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
is kind of adding as they go.

57:53.000 --> 57:56.000
Bobby does point out that people have modded in songs,

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
but they're just doing like expert hell songs.

57:58.000 --> 58:01.000
Yes, like the full Shrek movie audio track.

58:01.000 --> 58:05.000
Okay, for the lolz, okay, funny,

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
but as a practical, would I play this at a party?

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
No, this doesn't work. So, anyway.

58:11.000 --> 58:15.000
And YYR in chat says it'll probably remain in early access

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
until it's got a good list, like 30 to 40 at least.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Okay, cool. Cool.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
All right, let's talk about other games I've played this week.

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
So when I got home, my copy of Dragon Quest XI was waiting for me.

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
So I've been playing through Dragon Quest XI on PlayStation 4.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
God, I forget where I'm at.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
I don't want to ruin the story too much,

58:31.000 --> 58:34.000
but I just, the sisters just joined my party.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
That should be vague enough.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
It's not really spoiling anything,

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
but that's about where I'm at in the game.

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
It's about seven to eight hours in to the game.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
So, I mean, it's a Dragon Quest game.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
It's going to move a little slower.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
It's going to be a very long game, like 100 hours.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Here's the interesting thing about Dragon Quest.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
I don't think this series has changed at all, really,

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
since the last Dragon Quest game I played,

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
which is Dragon Quest VIII on the PlayStation 2.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
I didn't really play IX.

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
X was online and never released here, so I couldn't.

58:59.000 --> 59:04.000
So, I mean, it hasn't really seemed to have changed much since Dragon Quest VIII.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
But I think that's okay.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
That's kind of what people want.

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
Like, Dragon Quest is that series that hasn't changed a lot.

59:12.000 --> 59:15.000
I mean, okay, they have the pep system in there now,

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
and you can run around in spots.

59:17.000 --> 59:24.000
They haven't changed where, like, Final Fantasy XIII radically changed the battle system, right?

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
And some people liked it, some people hated it.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Dragon Quest XI didn't do that to you.

59:28.000 --> 59:32.000
It's still, you know, fight, item, run, you know, those basic types of things.

59:32.000 --> 59:36.000
That is the JRPG a lot of people want to play.

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
Exactly. Square Enix.

59:39.000 --> 59:43.000
So, you know what? Well, I mean, Dragon Quest XI is a Square Enix game.

59:43.000 --> 59:48.000
I know, but they have a whole other series of games called Final Fantasy,

59:48.000 --> 59:52.000
where they're like, no, let's change up the battle system yet again.

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
Well, I think that's the difference between these two franchises.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Final Fantasy is going to be a little different,

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
and it's going to push the envelope with graphics and sound and all that,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000
whereas Dragon Quest XI is going to be, you know, the tired and true.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
And that's not to knock it at all.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Like, I'm enjoying the story so far.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
They put voice acting in it, which the Japanese version didn't have.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Did you know that?

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
There's some hilarious tweets that are like, where's the Japanese voice acting?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Punchline. There wasn't any.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
They added the voice acting for the U.S. version.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
This is the international version, you know, because it's been out in Japan for a year.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
So they added the voice acting in for the U.S. version.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
They didn't release the Switch version, though, which is interesting,

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
because there is a Switch version, or supposed to be.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
No, I think there is one in Japan.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
For whatever reason, they didn't release it here yet.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I don't know if the voice acting had something to do with that or what it is.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
There's also a 3DS version they didn't release here,

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
which is interesting.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000
You know, again, maybe because they would have had to not be able to add some of the stuff they did.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
I don't know. I can only play the game that they did release, which is on PlayStation 4.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
And again, if you like Dragon Quest games, this game will satisfy you.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
However, I'm going to read this game on one thing.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
I'm going to tell you what the worst part of the game is.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
And this might surprise you.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Because this is the part of the game...

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I can't think of a game in a long time

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
where I've said this is the worst part of the game.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000
You ready? You know what the worst part of Dragon Quest XI is?

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
The soundtrack.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
That's right. And I know.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:26.000
They have an old-school composer that's been doing this franchise for a long time.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
They have a symphonic rendition that opens the game,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
except once you're in the game, you no longer have the symphonic renditions.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
It's like a MIDI rendering.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Honestly, the game fucking sounds like it's on my AdLib sound card in 1994.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Which, I guess in some ways is kind of cool, but this is Dragon Quest XI, people.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
And the songs are just...

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
They're not good.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
It relies a lot on the retro kitsch of

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
we've been doing this stuff the same way for a long time.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Even retro songs can sound good.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Yeah, it doesn't here, Logie. It just doesn't.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
So that's the one part of the game I'm going to read.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Not everybody's going to agree with me there.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Some people haven't already on Twitter, and that's fine.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
But for me, I just wanted more out of the soundtrack,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
especially when you have such a name behind...

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Why didn't they do the symphony for everything?

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
It probably cost a lot of money. I don't know.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:27.000
But I do know Final Fantasy, even though nothing was wrong with Nobui Matsu per se,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
they've used some newer, some different composers lately,

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
and there's been some great music still produced for Final Fantasy.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Especially in the case of Final Fantasy XIV.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Y'all know I love XIV's soundtrack.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
XIV is doing it right.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Dragon Quest XI is doing it wrong.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
So, anyway.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Bobby wanted you to review Ready Player One.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Oh, yeah. Okay.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Yeah, well, and this is for your benefit, too.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Okay, so going back to Dragon Con, I stayed an extra day this year

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
so that I wouldn't be rushing back on Labor Day.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
And this way I also got to see Bobby in Jennifer's house

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
because I didn't get to see that when I was out there for the wedding.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
And I think I'm allowed to talk about this.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
If not, sorry.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
But I think he did say I could talk about his theater.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000
So he actually converted part of his basement into a theater, and it's nice.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
He has 4K projection.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
He has the couches that Jamie has in her house,

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000
with the big old cup holders and things like that that are movie recliner seats.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
He has that, but he has them on the steps

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
so that he actually has a back row and a front row.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
So it's like a movie theater, so it's like a six-seat movie theater.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
And so he actually played a little bit of Horza Horizon 3

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
on that 4K projector on his Xbox One X.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
And I was like, this is hot.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
This is really hot.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
This is the way to game. This is awesome.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
So, of course, we had to watch something.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Let's put that movie theater to use, right?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Bobby has a guest over. Let's do something.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
So we decided to watch Ready Player One because I still hadn't seen it.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I will give you this, Loki. It didn't suck. I didn't hate it.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
It's kind of like how you felt about Nintendo's press conference.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
I didn't hate it.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
It was fine. I wasn't like, oh my god.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000
But I was like, okay, for a big popcorn, fun, dumb movie,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I was like, it was cool. I was into it.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
It's not going to win any Oscars.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Of course not.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
But for dumb, fun popcorn, it was cool.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Some of those scenes, the graphics, the visuals,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000
that racing scene right in the very beginning, that was really impressive.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
They did a lot of stuff with that that was really cool.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000
It was a long movie. That was one thing I noticed.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
It really started to be long.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000
There were some issues with the plot, but nothing too much.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Well, they kind of abridged it from the book.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
I heard they really changed it.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000
That's not really an excuse, though, because the author of the book

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
also kind of helped write the screenplay.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Bobby points out that his studio, and I always forget this,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000
his theater has Dolby Atmos sound with two speakers in the ceiling,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
so the race sounds amazing. It did.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
That's probably part of what really made it.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Now, here's the thing.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Going back, we made the right choice,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
and we really do need to watch Ready Player One.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Here's the thing.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
If I do this again next year, and I stay an extra day next year,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
not that I'm inviting myself to Bobby's house next year,

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
but there's a part of me that says he probably wouldn't care.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
I feel like the movie we should have watched is Tron Legacy.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Well, yes.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
So maybe that'll have to be next year's selection.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
I don't know, assuming there's no...

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Because now I'm like, oh, wow, I wonder what...

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
You know, thinking about racing scenes and sound and everything like that,

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I'm like, oh, God, Tron Legacy would have been so badass.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Anyway.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Oh, Bobby Blackwolf says,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000
I only have Tron on DVD, and DVDs don't look the best on that screen,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
even upscaled.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Tron Legacy doesn't have the Atmos sound mix,

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
but I'd still use 5.1.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000
And he's officially invited me in chat to stay again after DragonCon next year.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I have the original Tron on Blu-ray and the Tron Legacy on Blu-ray.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Yeah, I was gonna say, I could actually bring my...

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I do have Tron, because I bought that big pack...

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Yeah, the collector's edition.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
That had, like, all the Trons in it.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
All two of them.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Well, no, I said all the Trons, because it had the original Tron,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Tron Legacy, and it had the Tron Legacy 3D disc in it, too.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Yes.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
They were on separate discs.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
The 2D and 3D were separate.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Still haven't watched that yet on my PlayStation VR.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Yeah.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
So, all right.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
So, anyway.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Where were we?

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
So, yes, that was another thing I got to do while I was visiting Bobby.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
So, other games.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
We still have news to get into.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
This is what happens when we miss two weeks.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Sorry.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Anyway.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000
I've been playing Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch as well, continuing on those.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
That's all I need to say about that.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I've been playing the new World of Warcraft expansion.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
I don't know what the fuck came over me, but I was just like...

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Final Fantasy XIV is kind of in a lull right now.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
There are big patches until Tuesday, and, like,

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I'm not really playing online with anyone in that game right now,

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000
and all I see on Twitter are all my friends playing World of War...

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Wow, what the fuck?

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I'll just renew World of Warcraft.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I'll play that for a little bit.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
And the expansion is fine.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
But, like, the Horde zone that I'm playing in, Zandalar or whatever,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
with the big, like, Mayan temple-inspired thing,

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
it's a bitch to navigate,

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
and I hate that you don't have flying in a zone like that.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
That's my, like, I know that's, like, a weird criticism,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
but that's, like, my one criticism so far,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
is that, like, I hate the zone design.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
I guess that's the criticism.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I hate the zone design of that zone.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Maybe it gets better.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Everybody tells me the Alliance one is way better.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
I mean, I don't know how much of that is faction bias or whatever,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
but I'm just saying, since I started with the Horde character,

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
I wasn't too impressed with that particular zone.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.000
But what I am impressed with is that I'm, like, dang,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
like, here's a cinematic, there's a cinematic,

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
here's another cinematic.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I remember when, like, the WoW cinematic was your reward

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
for, like, beating the Lich King, the final boss in the game.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
You got a cinematic, and you got your one cinematic.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Now it's, like, dang, they have one, like, for every little thing that happens.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
And I thought the scenarios that really explain the backstory

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
about why we're on these new islands

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
and why the Horde and Alliance are super fighting again,

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
I thought that was really well done as well.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Except the one thing I don't understand,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
and maybe this is just because I didn't play Legion to completion,

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
so I will fault myself for this a little bit,

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
but one thing I kind of didn't understand is, like,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000
why did Sylvanas just all of a sudden become, like, a crazy person?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Like, I understand maybe she was, like, a little crazy before,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
but why is she all of a sudden, like, really fucking me?

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:38.000
It kind of feels like a rehash of what happened to Garrosh in Pandaria,

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
and so that's the only reason why I'm kind of calling it out,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
is I feel like I'm, like, this feels like territory we've been to before.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Is Sylvanas going to be the last boss of the expansion?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Because if so, that's kind of dippy, because we've seen that before.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
So we'll see, though. That's a very minor read.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
I don't know. We'll see how long I stick with it,

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000
but so far I guess I'm having a good enough time with it. We'll see.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Anyway, that's it. That's it for my gaming week.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Okay, we're going to get into news, but I need to go over one other topic.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
So this is, not everybody's heard this yet,

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000
so one thing, we did announce a DragonCon at one of the panels,

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
and so we talked about it a little bit in Discord,

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
which you can join our Discord anytime at vognetwork.com slash Discord,

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
and it was on Twitter and so forth,

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
but I realize there are many of you out there

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000
who only download the Orange Rounds Radio podcast every week,

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000
and you don't necessarily interact with the show a lot outside of listening to it,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
which is cool. Like, I'm super happy that you're listening,

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
so thank you, thank you for downloading the show and just giving it a try in the first place.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
So I realize there's a lot of you that haven't heard the news, so what is the news?

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
The news is that Orange Rounds Radio is going to be moving a little bit

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
by the end of the year. I don't have a date yet.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000
It's not, vognetwork is still a thing, so it's not that kind of move.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000
What is going to be changing is that we're no longer going to be using Shoutcast

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000
as the platform that we do our live presentation on Sunday nights.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
So really, since 2002,

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
this is something that hasn't changed since 2002 when OLR started.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:07.000
For the past 16 years, you used Shoutcast, a Winamp-type plug-in, to do this show.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
I mean, technically in the live 365 years we had a live,

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
but it was a fancier Shoutcast plug-in. That's all it was, okay?

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
So we've used Shoutcast to deliver this show for 16 years.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000
And y'all know if you do the same thing the same way all the time,

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
you're going to get the same results.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
And we're not getting a lot of new listeners to OLR.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
You know, we get some, and I'm very thankful.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Some of you take to heart what I say at the end of every show,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
and you do tell a friend or two about the show.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Some people find us through social media or when we're live.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:39.000
But we haven't really, really expanded our audience a lot in several years.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
And so I think in order to do that,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.000
I think we're going to have to really evaluate is Shoutcast really the best platform,

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
or is there another thing that could give us greater visibility?

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Is there another thing that could really expand the reach and accessibility

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
of something like OLR and Bobby Black Wolf and Anime Jam Session

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
and the other live shows that are on VOG Network?

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000
And so we made a decision that we're going to change from a Shoutcast show

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
to a Twitch show. That's right, Twitch.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000
So same thing that a lot of people stream their video games on,

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000
but you also know they have an IRL channel,

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000
and they do channels where people will tape live shows.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Sometimes these are like podcasts.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Sometimes it's the host kind of BSing with their audience for a while.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
That's the type of thing that it is.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000
So instead of using Shoutcast to deliver the show, it's going to be Twitch.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
However, there's always going to be people,

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
especially after you've done something one way for 16 years,

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
there's always going to be people that are like,

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000
but change, but I like the old way. This is what works for me.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Well, here's the thing. We want to try something new.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
And so this is going to be a new thing that we're trying.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000
But I don't want you to feel like the show is going to change. It's not.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Yes, there will be video available on Twitch.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000
You will see video of us doing a radio show.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
So I want to make that very clear.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Orange Launch Radio is not becoming...

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
No!

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Said Jamie.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Actually, Jamie, we wouldn't have done this if Jamie wasn't cool with it.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
She's fine with it, you know?

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
And remember, y'all, we've already done this.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
We did this when Justin TV was a thing.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
And OLR, like the show that you're hearing, didn't change.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
It was just that, oh, you could watch it on Justin TV.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
I need some better lighting in here.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Yeah, this room's going to change a little bit before that happens.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
But we'll get there.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Anyway, my point is that because I don't want people to be freaked out.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
They're like, oh my God, Orange Launch Radio is going to change.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
It's a TV thing now. I can't watch it.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
That's okay. We're still recording a podcast.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000
And it's still going to be the same podcast that you're used to.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Because I'm very aware that there's some of you out there who are blind

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
or have sight impairments and so forth.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
And so when I say that we're moving to a video-based platform,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
you might get a little nervous.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000
But I want to try to ease your fears a little bit saying that the way we produce

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
and what we're talking about with this show, that's not going to change.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
The way we put together OLR and all that, that's not going to change.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
It's just like our chat room will be a Twitch chat room.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000
And instead of using TuneIn to listen to Orange Launch Radio,

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000
you will use the Twitch app, which is available on your phone,

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
available on your PlayStation, your Xbox.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
It's available a lot of places.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
So that's another reason why Twitch is pretty appealing.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
So I hope you will at least give it a shot.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I don't have a date for that when that's all going to happen yet.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
For those of you that don't interact with us live,

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
you only download the podcast every week and check it out.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000
I really don't think for you anything's going to change at all.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
I really don't because it's still going to be the same show.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
It's just that instead of being shoutcast on Sunday night,

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
it's going to be on Twitch Sunday night.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
That's the only change.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000
But I think with a lot of the discoverability features that Twitch has in,

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
a lot of the features when it comes to,

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
some of you have been generous enough to say,

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
I would love to help you guys pay your bills.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000
I would love to be able to help Jamie buy more games

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000
or help fund Loki's project.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Obviously I'm being a little bit facetious,

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
but you guys have been kind enough to say,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000
I want to support the show financially.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
And I've always been very skittish about things like Patreon

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
because I don't want you paying upfront

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
for a service that we then have to deliver on.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Because, for example, last week we had to cancel the show due to illness.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
If you'd paid money for that show,

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I'm sure most of you would be understanding,

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
but there would be people that would feel a little bit like,

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
I paid for something I didn't get.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
But the nice thing about the Twitch and the subscriptions

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000
and the bits and things like that is that you can tip us if you want.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
You don't have to.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
If you want, you can do that.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
I will not be interrupting the show to read bit donate.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
We have an idea on how we're going to do that.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
We will acknowledge those of you that choose to do that.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
We're just not going to do it the way other Twitch streamers have done it.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
And I'll leave it at that.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Or I should say traditionally do it.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
We'll leave it at that.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
But it's because, again, the radio show has not changed.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
It's not going to stop every five seconds to say,

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
oh, thanks for the bits.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Act F to appreciate it.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
I'll still read chat comments because we've always done that.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
But I just won't stop to read those types of things.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.000
But also the subscriptions will hopefully allow us to give you something new

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
that you haven't been able to get before.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Again, I want to stress you're not going to have to pay

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:18.000
for OLR's audio podcast feed that you've always gotten for free.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
That's not going to change.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
You guys know I'm not going to do that to you.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
But it will allow us to offer something additional to subscribers.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.000
And if you use your deductive thinking to think about what is going to be different

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000
on Twitch versus Shoutcast, you can probably piece together what might be extra.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
I'm not wearing any pants.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
You'd probably be correct on what you're going to get.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
But I'll leave it at that because, officially,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
we haven't worked all that out yet, officially.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Anyway, I've been turning away from chat because I haven't been totally paying attention.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000
I want to read some of the comments here at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
bonds006 says, I listened to the music stream.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Not as much now, but I used it a lot in the past.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
I respect that.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000
And I'm sorry that we are having to sunset that.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.000
I will point out the radio costs us a lot.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000
The music stuff is in a gray area.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
I'm not sure we should be playing.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
I'm not sure that music feed should exist.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.000
So another part of the reason we're doing this is to get us out of that legal gray area

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000
because that will also enable us to do some extra things that we've wanted to do.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000
And I hope you guys will understand.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Let's see.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Other comments in chat at live.vognetwork.com.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
rageator in chat says, FYI, although I can't tip very often because poor,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
I tip people from time to time on Twitch and I can get bits easily due to watching ads.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Again, this isn't about money.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
This is not about money.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
It's not about money.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000
It's not about money.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Because if we haven't made money in 16 years and we're still doing it.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
It's not like we've started a Kickstarter or anything.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Exactly.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000
We can't do this show.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Here's the thing.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000
So here's the thing.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
If you want to watch ads and tip us biddies, that is so awesome.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
I'm so thankful and cool.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
But you know what you can do on Twitch for free?

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Hosts, making clips and sharing those clips on social media.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:10.000
And all of that will be worth just as much as biddies, if not more, honestly.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000
So please don't feel any type of financial obligation to this show.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Puba in chat says, centralized feed, chat and financial support.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
And all in all, a bigger platform for exposure.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
This is a no brainer.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000
So happy for you all.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Thank you, Puba.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000
That's definitely in the right direction as to why we're making this change in the first place.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Let's see.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Also trying to get some of the other comments here in chat at live.vognetwork.com.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Tiger Conchet says, I'm using a service called Restream which allows me to broadcast on multiple platforms all at once.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
So I'd have a stream on Twitch, Mixer, YouTube, Gaming, even Periscope.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
The plan is to go to Twitch affiliate status with VOG Network.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000
And so the affiliate contract would not allow that.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000
We could put clips on YouTube and things like that.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:59.000
I am going to, I think it's safe for me to tell you, that is not in our plan.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.000
We will not be putting today, it's not in our plan today.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
I'm a never say never type of person.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:11.000
But we may do delayed clips on those services in the future, but that's not the plan.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
The plan is to go all in on Twitch.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
For now.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000
And if that doesn't prove to be the right thing to do, then we might change it later.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.000
But again, the Twitch affiliate agreements wouldn't allow us to use the restreaming thing.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
It's only going to be on Twitch.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Let's see, one other thing, let's see.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.000
TigerClawnChat says on Twitch you can do reruns, so if you did a live show you can have Twitch rebroadcast it since those are archived.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000
You're right, we could.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
So, anyway.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Alright, thank you guys for your flexibility.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
I will give you a date on that.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000
We're targeting by the end of the year, but as Loki hinted there, we have to make a lot of changes to studio.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:52.000
We have to buy some new equipment, which my husband is currently unemployed, so that's a bit of a challenge.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000
But we are looking at hopefully in the next couple months we'll be there.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
So the goal is by the end of the year.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.000
So stay tuned to all the latest updates.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000
We'll be updating folks in our Discord as well as social media.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Again, because I can't stress this enough and I don't want people to freak out over change,

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.000
if you're listening to this on your podcast in your car on the way to work because you download this show on Monday morning,

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I really don't think anything is going to change for you.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
We're still going to just put out the show as we always have,

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:28.000
as we did when we were broadcasting on Justin TV for a short while that most of you probably forgot or didn't know about.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:34.000
It's just that we're kind of going back to that a little bit, but this time it's all in on that.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Anyway, there you go.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, small steps forward, progress will come.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Yes, I agree. That is a good note to end on.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Alright, let's move on from there.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Enough meta stuff about us.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000
We're only like an hour and 20 minutes into the show and we've only talked about that in Nintendo Direct.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
But there's other stuff going on, right, Loki?

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Yes, there is. In fact, Nintendo Direct in Japan was a little bit different as well.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.000
In fact, one game that's going to be coming to Nintendo Switch in Japan is Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.000
What? You may say, how can that possibly run on a Switch?

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Well, it's going to be a cloud version of the game.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:17.000
So basically what's going to happen is you're going to be able to stream it to the game console using, I guess, their cloud service.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:26.000
And so that way you'll be able to get the same visuals that you would see elsewhere, but, you know, on a less powerful platform.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:33.000
They're partnering with, I guess, a Taiwanese game streaming company called Ubitis Game Cloud.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:39.000
It's going to cost players $20 to rent the game and stream it for 180 days.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.000
And all you have to do is download the 45 megabyte client.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
So, interesting that they're doing that.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Interesting that they didn't announce it here.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Is this something about Japan's internet structure versus ours?

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
I think theirs is better than ours.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Well, I wouldn't doubt that for a minute, but it's kind of interesting that they're focusing on Japan with that.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000
I think it's a really clever, cool little workaround.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Honestly, I know this isn't the popular concept, but gaming's kind of going this direction.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Future consoles, we've already heard rumblings that Microsoft may put out.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:23.000
We don't know for sure, but Microsoft, in addition to whatever Xbox 2 Y console they're going to do in the future,

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:32.000
they may put out a very bare bones, there's been a lot of rumors about a bare bones streaming device that only does the streaming type of stuff.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
And playing games in the cloud and all that.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.000
And that's, you guys, it's 2018 and the Phantom is finally here.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
The Phantom console, finally. Finally.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
It's just so ahead of its time.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
It's just ahead of its time.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Well, we laugh, but where's the lie?

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Do you think that this is where games are? We're going to be playing games in the cloud.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:58.000
I mean, sure, there's latency issues and things like that today, but internet's only going to get better, Loki.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Well, at least I hope my internet gets better by Tuesday when the tech comes so I can get back to live streaming, but anyway.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Yeah, I mean, what I would see with the new Xbox console is it not necessarily going to be something that is its own standalone streaming thing.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:23.000
I could see them integrating it into TVs like you would see with the Roku device, like my TV has a built in Roku device.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
And you can just stream it with that.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Or it could be an app that works with those devices so that you can stream through that and then you just sync your Bluetooth, Xbox One controller and away you go.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
So I could see something like that.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Be interested in seeing how popular this is. I'm kind of curious to see how it works out.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
It looked cool based on the demo and stuff.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:55.000
So be interested to see what other games could come to the platform. And that might be an option for, you know, like Battlefield and Call of Duty and stuff like that.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Going to chat at live.voguenetwork.com, YYR says, get that streaming crap out of my video games. As someone who mostly plays arcade style fast paced games, I don't ever want to stream them.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Okay, sure. No, I get that. And like you can't stream music based games or any of that stuff. Like I totally get that.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:22.000
But at the same time, what if the internet and all this cloud technology, what if the latency gets just as good on that as it does from the wireless controller to your television is today?

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Because at the rate the technology is multiplying, I'm just saying, like, you know, we're not there yet. So it's tough to visualize.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:36.000
But I imagine what in 10 years, the latency between your wireless controller and your TV is going to be just as fast as latency on your internet.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:46.000
And so some of these issues will get better, I think, you know, but then again, you know, as I'm experiencing firsthand this week, a lot of that falls in the hands of somebody else.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:58.000
And when that fails, it can be very frustrating. So I also can understand why people may not want to go all in on the cloud because maybe their internet is not going to be that reliable. So I get that.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000
And they're doing all they can right now to fight making it any better.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Yeah. And YYR does point out there's a lot of folks in rural communities who are stuck with crappy internet. So that's true.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000
So maybe this, you know, cloud streaming thing won't be for everybody. I just kind of feel like, I don't know.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
It's a neat experiment. Let's see if it works.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Yeah. Even in rural areas, they have satellite. And yes, that's very expensive. But you know what? Mobile phones were really expensive for every minute when they first came out.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:39.000
And you know, now everybody, like everybody has an iPhone or an Android in their pocket, almost there. I shouldn't say everybody, but you know, you're not paying for that technology, which you used to in the mid 90s, which for all intents and purposes was not that long ago.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:46.000
That's kind of that's kind of where I'm going with this is that technology is going so fast. And it's hard to visualize where it's going to be in 10 years.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:57.000
But like, if you consider the ground we've made in the next 20 years, I don't think it's unreasonable to think that even people in rural communities will get fast internet out of thin air in 20 years.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Because look at where we've come from 20 years ago to today. I guess. I guess that's my point.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Bobby Blackwell points out, excuse me, the budget phone X phone iPhone XR is $750. Well, that's why people are paying the monthly fees at this point to lease them like they're their cars or something like that.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:29.000
But at the same time, get an I'm sure many people would say get an Android and that's fine. I don't like the whole anti iPhone or anti Android stuff. I think both having both is good.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Get a comparable Android device then if you want. I just iPhone 7 is going to be cheaper and cheaper.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Or I just like what am I really getting for that premium price? And that's not just Apple. That's just like any phone.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:53.000
I mean, I love my iPhone 10. I really do. I'm not going to buy one of these new phones. It's not enough of an upgrade from what I already have to pay that price.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:00.000
If I was still rocking my iPhone 6 Plus, then maybe I would, you know, which I was last year when I bought the 10, then maybe I would look into that.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.000
But anyway, this is this is not the mobile phone podcast. We have plenty of other gaming stuff to get into.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.000
But so would you would you be open to playing more games through streaming Loki?

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:18.000
No, because I've tried that even locally through my network to just play games streaming from my PlayStation 4.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Although I haven't tried it with the pro, so I'm not sure if that works any better now, but it has not been a satisfactory experience.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:35.000
And so I will not be doing that in the future. Yeah. Although I may try it now with the pro that I think of it because my wife doesn't really watch Netflix all the time.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:45.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase PEAK.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Well, let me move on to a different type of streaming. So I've talked a lot about Twitch, Twitch, Twitch.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.000
But of course, Mixer is a player out there and, you know, Mixer's continuing to do their stuff through Microsoft.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:04.000
And this is something pretty cool that sets Mixer apart, is that you are getting now in-game bonuses for Mixer streams for Forza Horizon 4.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:14.000
No, the game isn't out yet, but the demo is. And so if you stream the demo online, the streamer and the viewer actually get in-game rewards from this.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Influence is kind of the scoring, the currency sort of in Forza Horizon.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000
You know, as you do tricks, you get more influence, you get fans and stuff like that.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Yeah. One way you can get influence is broadcasting and watching broadcast through Mixer. That's pretty cool.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Now, we have seen, I mean, it isn't brand new to have games influenced by live streams on Twitch and Mixer and other platforms.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:43.000
But, you know, Forza Horizon 4 is a pretty big title, a pretty, you know, big like first party game to get something like this.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:49.000
And I think it's really cool. So anyway, as long, everything has to be linked to your Xbox gamer tag.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:56.000
And you get influence points every five minutes that you watch a feed. If you're streaming it, you get every two minutes.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000
The game itself, again, is out on September 28th. It will continue this.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000
But the demo that's going on right now is giving you some of like the pre-rewards with this.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:10.000
So, you know, giving more reason to stream and kind of participate together. I think that's really cool.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Something that Forza is also doing, Forza Horizon 4, would be James Bond DLC.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:24.000
That's right. There's going to be a Forza Horizon 4 pack that will bring ten of Bond's iconic cars to the game.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:30.000
We don't know the exact cars yet, but we do know the best of Bond pack is going to be available when the game comes out.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000
So assuming there will be an Aston Martin and all this stuff.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Oh no, we do know the list. We don't know the price. So we do know some of them.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:44.000
So we know, of course, Aston Martin, the 1964 DB5 and the 2015 DB10 will be there.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000
The BMW Z8 from The World Is Not Enough will be there as well.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:52.000
So some of the iconic Bond cars will be there. We just don't know the exact price yet.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:57.000
So, pretty cool. Yeah, I'm super hyped for Forza Horizon 4.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.000
As if I didn't have enough to play right now, but here it is. September's here.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:07.000
And now the ramp up to the end of the year begins where there's going to be stuff like every single week that's going to be something you want to play.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000
So, anyway.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, RageNator in chat says,

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:18.000
I hear that Mixer has been having major growing pains and stability issues to the point where streams have been totally unwatchable.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:26.000
I haven't heard that, but I haven't used Mixer a lot. I did randomly watch it on my Xbox One the other night.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000
I was watching some of the stuff that Microsoft kind of puts together themselves.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.000
They were actually doing a program about World of Warcraft, which I thought was interesting.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000
So, I mean, it's not like they're going to cover PlayStation games,

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000
but I don't think they're going to ignore that, you know, Nintendo is out there,

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.000
especially when they've got these Minecraft play together things going on.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:48.000
And, you know, PC. I mean, Microsoft still has a lot to win in the PC space.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:53.000
So, it doesn't surprise me that they're talking about World of Warcraft for Windows, right?

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:57.000
So, all right. Anyway, moving on. Loki.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:06.000
All right. Well, speaking of Microsoft, one of their properties, Alan Wake, is, I guess, expected to become a TV show.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000
So, that's different.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.000
I haven't actually played Alan Wake. I know a little bit about it,

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:18.000
but neat to see that it's actually being turned into that.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:26.000
So, I guess I'm going to continue off where the story, I guess, ended

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:32.000
and take place along with the inhabitants of Bright Falls.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000
They said the story of the original game is our starting point,

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:41.000
the seed of which we will expand our bigger story that we're exploring in the show.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
We'll be expanding the lore of this crazy dark universe

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:49.000
and diving deeper into certain aspects of it than the game ever did.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Not only that, but through the years, we've worked on multiple game concepts

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000
and stories for Alan Wake's world that have never seen the light of day.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:04.000
All of this material will function as the potential source material for the show.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Neat.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Yeah, it seems a little late, seeing as this game was a little while ago.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:15.000
I don't know if maybe there'll be a new Alan Wake game or something to kind of go with it.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:21.000
But, I mean, I felt like I was playing a TV show when I played the game.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.000
I think it is a game a lot of people slept on that's really good.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000
It was an episodic game.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:31.000
It was very Twin Peaks-ish, and it even had its whole show-within-a-show type of thing that was going on.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.000
I really would check this out. Why not? I think it would be very cool.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Alright, will you watch the Alan Wake TV show?

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Probably not, just because I've never played the game.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000
I mean, I don't know.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
You don't need to see the game to watch the show.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Maybe. I don't know.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Alright. Anyway.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Also, talking about streaming with Twitch and Microsoft.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Finally, a redesigned Twitch app for the Xbox One is on the way.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Some people were wondering were they going to bother because Microsoft is obviously going in on Mixer quite a bit.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:07.000
But, nope, the answer is there are still people that are using Twitch on their Xbox One.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Hello, I'm one of them, actually. I use Twitch a lot on my Xbox One.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.000
So I'm happy that they're finally updating with the PlayStation 4 version.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Right now, it's only part of the Insiders test group.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000
So you do have to be in the Insiders test group, which I think I'm in, but I don't have this.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
I think I haven't opted into it yet.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:27.000
I think you have to launch the whole actual, like, Insider app and then enable it.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
So, maybe that's what I need to do.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:35.000
But, some of the things that will be in this will be live video previews so that you can see the live streams while you browse.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Which, the desktop version of this does this automatically.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Sometimes annoyingly so.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Like, right when you go to the Twitch front page, you get somebody's stream and let's just hope they're not screaming.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:49.000
You can also see chat on offline videos, which is really cool.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Especially since, you know, maybe this pre-recorded stream thing is something I'm going to have to do for a little bit until these upload issues get fixed.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:59.000
So, the fact that you can do the chat after the fact is pretty cool.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.000
And, yeah, just do some improved stability and some additions there on the Twitch app.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:08.000
So it's going to kind of bring it up to parity with the PlayStation 4 version, to which I say good.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:13.000
And I hope they're also future-proofing it by putting the tag system into it and some of that stuff.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Because the communities are not in the Xbox One version right now.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
And I don't think it's in the PlayStation 4 version either.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:23.000
And that kind of bothers me because I do like to look in community tags a lot.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Like Small Streamer, Twitch, Unity, those types of tags.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
I like to look in those a lot to try to find new people.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
And you can't do that on the consoles today.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:36.000
So I do hope, you know, we know that those are going away in favor of the tagging system, which is going to be similar.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:41.000
I really hope that the apps will have the tagging stuff built into it.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
That would make me very happy.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Anyhow, a few more stories before we get into the Classic Game of the Week.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Loki.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
One game I forgot to mention that I did play this week, Pokémon GO.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
I'm playing quite a bit of that.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:58.000
But you could be playing even more of that in some of these regions throughout the world.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Brazil and Korea, they have opened up the ability for players to nominate new Pokéstops in those regions.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.000
I'm guessing because there isn't a lot of them there.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:22.000
But apparently they said for level 40 trainers in Brazil and Korea, you'll be able to submit different locations and objects through the app settings menu.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:28.000
To actually pin locations that could possibly become Pokéstops in the future.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:33.000
And eventually they will open it up wider as they roll it out.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:41.000
I'm assuming kind of like they did with Ingress where it will be available for lower level trainers.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000
And then for more regions I'm assuming.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.000
So this is kind of just a little bit of a test bench.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:57.000
And then right now they're saying, of course we've seen different sponsored Pokéstops, Sprint and Starbucks.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.000
But they're hoping that according to the CEO.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Fostering these moments of discovery and exploration is the foundation of what we do.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:17.000
The world is a big place and the only way we can find the very best locations for inclusion in our game is with the help of its players.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:23.000
So you ready for me to say something that not everybody is going to like?

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.000
As an Ingress player I'm not really a big fan of this at all.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Here's the thing, before you come at me with your pitchfork and torches.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:36.000
I realize that a lot of rural players, and I'm not trying to be elitist.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
So please let me explain myself here.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Because you know I hate that elitism and stuff so let me explain why.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Ingress is a very player versus player game.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
It is extremely player versus player.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:52.000
To the point where people on the other team, I don't really interact with an awful lot.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Because if they know where I am, they know the targets I can hit.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.000
And it's the same thing with them because that is how PvP that game is.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Those of you playing Pokémon GO, Mystic versus Valor versus Instinct for all the shit talking that goes on amongst those teams.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000
That is not PvP.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
In fact it's quite the opposite.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:15.000
You need people of the other team to help you out, to knock you out of gyms if you want your 50 coins.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Like if the people are not there to fight you, you're not going to get your own rewards.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:22.000
So this is the reason why.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:31.000
I am completely fine with new Pokéstops being added into Pokémon GO and only Pokémon GO from the Pokémon GO players.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:35.000
I do not want to see those Pokéstops become Ingress portals.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Because since you know, and keep in mind I'm not just a level 16 Ingress player which is the max.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:47.000
I'm a level 39 which is one level below max Pokémon GO player.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:52.000
If somebody puts a Pokéstop on their house, I mean it doesn't really hurt anything.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.000
That's fine, it's a Pokéstop, whatever.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
I mean some might say game balance blah blah blah.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Whatever, it's not as big of a deal as a portal in Ingress going on your house.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000
And now people are going to be like attacking, trying to field from it.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:11.000
And they're doing strategic things where it's like I'm going to manipulate the fuck out of this portal because I live on top of it and I don't even have to like travel at all.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Because that is already a problem in some regards today.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:20.000
And that problem is only going to get worse if we get shitty Pokéstop submissions in Ingress.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.000
You know what I mean?

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
So again, and I want to make myself very clear.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:29.000
I am fine if Pokémon GO players create Pokéstops that are only in Pokémon GO.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:40.000
But since they're having the Ingress OPR system review these, I'm a little nervous that they're going to cross over into Ingress at some point.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Now, the way it is now, I'm still okay with it. Why?

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Because the Ingress players who understand the PvP, who are not going to allow these portals to go into places where they're going to have portal battles and so forth going on.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.000
They're going to continue to not allow that stuff.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
And so hopefully that will fix some of the real problem.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:06.000
But if they allow Pokémon players to start doing the review and those things go into Ingress, Ingress is going to be ruined.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Mark my words.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:14.000
So maybe I'm just being that old codger that fears change.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Ingress 2.0.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Yeah, but it's still the same game.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
So anyway, that's just my take on that.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
And I'm sure you know what?

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Many of you don't give a shit about Ingress.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000
That's cool.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
But please recognize that I do.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
And I made friends through the game.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000
And so yes, I really do not want to see my game get screwed up.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.000
And we also, right now we don't know how the Harry Potter game is going to play.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000
No, we don't.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Because if that's very PvP.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Yeah, it very well could be.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Then you're going to regret some of these decisions and stops.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Yeah, you really are.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
So anyway.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000
We'll play, I bet, four way PvP too with that game.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.000
I do think though, the way they've implemented it now,

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
OPR is already so backlogged.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.000
I can access Ingress OPR and I can review portals and stuff.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
And I have.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Actually I think I have 960 agreements last I checked.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
So I've reviewed a lot of portals.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
I've seen some of the bullshit people submit.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
I've seen toilets.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000
I've seen cats.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:15.000
I've seen the picture of somebody's hand saying I'm just testing this to see if it works.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
I've seen all the bullshit in there.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.000
And I've seen some really rad stuff too.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:25.000
And I've seen stuff in the middle of fucking nowhere that's pretty awesome.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000
I've seen trail markers on places I probably would never go.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000
And sign boards that explain a vista point in places I'll probably.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
You know, that's all rad.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:36.000
And that's the type of stuff I hope to continue to see and all that stuff and so forth.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000
But anyway.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Where was I going with all this?

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Where was the old man going?

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Don't fuck up our shit.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:47.000
No, it's that they don't really give a lot of incentive for Ingress players to review in OPR.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:51.000
And so I feel like this is just going to backlog an already backlogged system.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Can't get a bad Joe.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Niantic just needs to probably hire some people to do some of the reviews internally.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:04.000
And on top of that, I've submitted nice photos for those Pokestops and the Ingress locations.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Especially when we have old ass photos on there.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000
And sometimes they get voted up and they're used.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:15.000
But sometimes it doesn't seem like they use the new photos to help them.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Let me get to some comments in our chat at live.vognetwork.com.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Captain Spike from the wonderful Game Buoy podcast says, Gamebuoy.org says,

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:26.000
I don't know though, isn't this mostly about other regions where the community is currently not being served?

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:33.000
It feels like this opens the game up to communities that maybe currently aren't able to participate due to their locations.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.000
I realize Ingress isn't as popular. It's available in all these same areas.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.000
But sure, some of these rural places are probably not as well accounted for.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
But the system is this way now.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:50.000
But you guys don't think it's going to roll out beyond...

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.000
It's going to be worldwide at some point. It really is.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:58.000
So maybe they'll geofence it so that it's really only rural places.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:03.000
I don't know, but I'm just kind of worried that it's going to get unleashed on everybody.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.000
What it is for now is a test, but that's kind of what it is.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.000
So they're only allowed to submit in those locations?

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000
They're only allowed to submit in Brazil and South Korea right now.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Limiting it to players in those locations because I can see someone, oh hey, I'm a player.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Remember how when the brand new nearby system rolled out, you only saw it in San Francisco in the beginning?

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Yes.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Because it's like that. It was geofenced in that cell.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.000
The Charlie 2, which are...

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
See, I'm relating it to Ingress.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:39.000
So that geofence was the exact same fence because Davis was included in some of those places.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000
It was the exact same fence that makes up the Charlie 2 cell in Ingress.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.000
That was the location you could see the nearby stuff in Pokémon GO.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Anyway, cool story.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Let's see, and Bobby Blackwell says, wasn't it Russia that just got Pokémon GO released this week?

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Yes, that is true. They just got Pokémon GO finally this week.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:04.000
So anyway, I'm sure not everybody's going to agree with my thoughts, but please try to consider this other game that I have invested a lot of time into.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Again, this is all I'm saying. I do not want the Pokémon GO stuff to go back into Ingress.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000
That is it.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000
If the Pokémon GO community wants to add every...

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Every rock is a Pokéstop and everything, everywhere, every mailbox is a Pokéstop, fine.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Go for it.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
But keep it in that game.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Do not bring it to the PvP game that is Ingress.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000
That's what I'm saying to make that very, very, very clear.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000
All right.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:37.000
CaptainSpike says, gameboi.org, but I appreciate your concerns and I'm sure balance issues will arise for a time.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:44.000
But to me, this seems like growth that overall should be healthy for all of their IP based software as having more players keep them going.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:48.000
As long as the submissions are legitimate, yes.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:59.000
But let me tell you the frustration of somebody's fucking tree in their grandma's house front yard being a portal in Ingress.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Or a fake horse.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000
It is something that holds down all of these different...

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Because one team knows that's their grandma's house and that's...

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:13.000
They can control that as much as they want and it fucks up the balance of the game.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Like that is a perspective that is very hard for me to explain to a Pokémon GO player.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:22.000
That is how the balance of the game can be very fucked up if anything and everything becomes a Pokéstop.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Absolutely I want more rural players to have all their Pokéstops.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.000
I really do.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.000
And I want rural players to have Ingress portals.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000
I do.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.000
I want them to be legitimate.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Every park should be littered with this shit.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
I'm so for that.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Historical sites. Public access.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Yes, I'm all for that stuff.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Residential property. Fuck. No.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
That's my concern.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Hopefully that makes sense.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.000
I have a pretty particular looking tree, perhaps.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
All you have to do is put googly eyes on it, Loki.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000
I'm going to.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:59.000
It only took us like three fucking years to get that portal removed in Ingress.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:06.000
That story, that was a true fucking story that I just explained.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Anyway, let's move on.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:15.000
I got one more story for you guys and it has to do with breaking the law, breaking the law.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
EA is breaking the law.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
No, legit, they are legit.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Yeah, I know.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
In Belgium, here's the deal.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:27.000
We know the Belgian government, because we heard about this with Overwatch, because they had to change the system and so forth.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Belgium declared loot boxes to be a form of gambling.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Well, EA has come out with FIFA 19, just came out recently and just basically said,

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
we are not going to change the pack.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:43.000
EA did not modify FIFA's randomized card pack loot boxes.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:49.000
EA says that the games were developed and implemented ethically and lawfully around the world.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.000
They do not agree that the games are considered as any form of gambling.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Basically...

01:44:53.000 --> 01:45:00.000
We're making too much fucking money from this and your little pitiful fines are going to stop us from making all of the money.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:07.000
EA is doing something that I feel, in my opinion, the president does on Twitter all the time.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.000
If I say something enough, it'll be true.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
So that's what's happening, right?

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:18.000
EA is saying, it's not gambling.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.000
It's not gambling.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.000
That's their defense.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
If EA says it enough, maybe it'll be true.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Just like, it's not collusion, it's not collusion.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Right?

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000
It's a similar thing.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
If I say it enough, maybe it'll be true.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000
I'm going to get hate mail for that one, but deal with it.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:38.000
But the reality is, at the end of the day, you are selling a product in this country,

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:45.000
and if you're not following the country's rules, they're going to pursue and kick you out, basically, of being able to sell games in the country,

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
possibly fine you because you've been making money off the citizens.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
I hope they fine them a lot.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Well, what's happening is that the Belgian government has launched, according to reports,

01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:01.000
has launched a criminal investigation into EA because they have not modified the system.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.000
This is according to the Metro publication.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
It's a publication in Belgium.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:11.000
They are being subject to a criminal investigation by the Brussels Public Prosecutor's Office.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.000
The case will go to court if they choose to prosecute.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Finland is also looking into these loot boxes as well, so more countries will hopefully jump on board.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000
It's terrible.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Seriously, I don't play a lot of these sports games that these are still in because they're not taking them out of the sports games.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:34.000
They may take them out of Star Wars and out of Battlefield and stuff like that,

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:41.000
but you've got to understand that this Ultimate Team shit, they're making bank off of this shit.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.000
They're making so much bank that they're not going to fucking compromise that.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:50.000
When my Xbox account got stolen on my Xbox 360, and it was like 10 years ago and I still haven't gotten over it,

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:54.000
the thief used my card to buy a bunch of FIFA shit.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:59.000
This stuff is huge around the world, even if it's not as big in the US, so it's a little harder to picture.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:04.000
I know some people are into it, certainly here in the US, but it's not Fortnite.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:08.000
But in other countries, FIFA is the game.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:14.000
But NBA 2K19, for example, totally different company, same shit.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:20.000
The game is just so pay-to-win, even.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:27.000
You buy the collector's edition, you get 100,000 of it's even called virtual currency

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:32.000
because they couldn't think of an intelligent name for it, virtual currency.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:38.000
You get 100,000 of it to help build your stats of your character in the game to be a better player.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Otherwise, you've got to grind through the game.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:45.000
And they're like, oh, it's player choice. This way, you don't have to grind as hard and stuff.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:50.000
But the problem is, you built the fucking grind into the game in the first place.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:58.000
You're not helping people, you're creating the problem and then also creating the solution for the problem that costs money.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:03.000
But people will pay it because, I don't know.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:06.000
It's the same reason why people will pay $1200 for a phone.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Well, you can imagine social media has lit up about this and pretty much most of what people are saying about EA.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:19.000
They're basically saying to Belgium, they're saying, yes, drag her, expose her, arrest her.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.000
That's basically what social media is saying to EA.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Drag them, get them.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Because I think most people have just had it with loot box shit.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:36.000
They've just had it with loot box shit and they want to see EA have to answer for it.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:41.000
If you want to make these games free to play, make FIFA a free to play game that you can just go download for free.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Hey FIFA 19, it's a free game, go download it. NBA 2K 19, it's a free game, go download it and they have loot boxes in it.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
I have no fucking problem with that.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:58.000
I'm just surprised EA had a year to think about how to make these buku bucks instead of the loot boxes and they kind of failed to do it.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:04.000
So now they're just sticking to their guns and I really think EA is going to get kicked out of Belgium for this.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
I think this is where this ends.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
EA products will be banned in Belgium.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.000
I don't think they'll fucking care because they're probably going to lose.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
It's just Belgium.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
They're going to lose less money just like whatever.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Sorry. You know what's sad? I know we have listeners in Belgium that listen to this show and I just want to say, even if EA doesn't appreciate you, I appreciate you.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Okay? And your chocolate and your waffle and all the stereotypes.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
It's a calculated risk. They understand what they're making from this.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:36.000
They don't want to give any of that up because it's tons of fucking money for doing essentially nothing.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:42.000
And that's what they're going to do. They're going to play this out because what's the worst that's going to happen?

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.000
They're going to maybe have to pay a small fine and maybe they can't sell their game.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Oh no. The Twitter says they're going to arrest the CEO.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.000
They're not going to arrest anything.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
He's going to rot in Belgium jail.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:57.000
As much as I would love to see that, that's never going to happen.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Drag her. Expose her. Say it, Logie.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Drag her. Expose her.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Drag her. Expose her.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:11.000
As much as it's never going to fucking happen, we can't arrest people over here for like actual crimes and get them to the jail.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
I mean, it's never going to fucking happen.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:19.000
All right. Anyway, on that note, let's, uh, let's go.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Let's go to a time when, you know, video games were for everybody, including people in Belgium.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Let's go to the classic game of the week or acid is the classic peripheral of the month.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Uh, y'all know we use radio magic to make this happen and, uh, get dark Sakura with us here every week on the show.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:43.000
But I do want to let you know, just due to us being unexpectedly off last week, see, we had calibrated our radio magic to work last week.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:46.000
And, uh, unfortunately due to an error in the space time.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:52.000
You know what? Fuck it. The real story is we recorded it last week, so you have to hear it this week.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.000
So if you hear some things that are a little bit out of sync, that's why.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
That being said, radio magic.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:04.000
So let's take a trip through space and time to visit with dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Oh, hi.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Hi. How are you?

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I'm okay.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:12.000
I feel like it's been a while between, uh, our week off and, uh, you know, the, the mess up a couple of weeks ago.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.000
It's been a little while.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Yeah, a bit, a bit, a bit.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Uh, can you tell us quickly in 15 seconds, what have you been doing in the past three weeks?

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Playing Wow.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Okay. That, that sums it up.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Going to work, being sick, playing pinball.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.000
We have a theater magic.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Oh, congrats on that.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:32.000
And it was the first time I've arranged a pinball purchase myself from ground up.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000
She's a business woman.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Dan was very proud of me and it has nothing wrong with it.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
He's like, I don't know what to do with the machine.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.000
I don't have to work on.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:44.000
So, um, it's going to make me broke for the month.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Real quick. Cause I know it's going to come up on OLR tonight.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.000
I don't even know if you know this yet.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Did you hear about the Valley Williams license?

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Uh, it was announced that the creators of Zen pinball actually have that.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:59.000
So it's going to come to pinball FX three, even though it was in the farsight studios game, the pinball arcade.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:04.000
So it was kind of, kind of surprising that I get, well, I mean it's like surprising, but not surprising.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.000
That's cool.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Yeah. So I played, they have, what's the, what's the table you can play right now?

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Cause they just played earlier this week.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:14.000
The fish fishing, something real fish, real fishing, something like that.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.000
I don't know.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
I also played the getaway.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.000
I'm just thinking of fish tales, which was an older one.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000
It was like from the nineties.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Yeah. We have the getaway.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Okay. Yeah. Oh, okay. That's a, you can play that one too. Anyway.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.000
No, I mean literally I have that machine, that table.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Yeah. I think I remember playing it at your house.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.000
So you have to, you have to play the pinball FX one and see how it compares.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:38.000
But anyway, I mean, we've been talking about all sorts of news tonight.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
We got to get into the classic game of the week.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.000
That's what you're here to do is to school us.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Not a game.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Oh, Oh, what a twist.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Oh yeah. We're a little behind.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000
We got to catch up with the peripherals.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:49.000
We're on September now.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
We did, I did, I did, um, August.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Did we do August?

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Yeah. I think August I did, um, the dance pads.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
I don't know. I think because of the work snafu,

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
I think this might actually be August thing.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:03.000
I will look up what month we're doing and you can talk about what we're

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:07.000
going to talk about. So what is the classic peripheral for the month?

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.000
What it ever it is.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:15.000
The Sega 3d glasses, which I felt inspired to do wink, wink, wink, wink.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Anyway.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:19.000
It might be a suggestion because I knew I was going to talk about VR

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:22.000
tonight. Cause I got to play Bobby's at dragon one.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.000
So it was a little hint. So this is 1980s, VR.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:30.000
They were also known as a Sega scope, 3d glasses. And in Brazil,

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.000
they were called Oculus 3d Rob.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Oh, Oculus Oculus, Oculus, Oculus rift roped.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.000
And in Argentina, they were, I'm going to mispronounce this.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.000
3d.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Okay.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.000
If I remember right, if I, if I remember my Spanish from, from high school,

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.000
I think.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Okay. Okay.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:58.000
But anyway, these were for the Sega master system and they would, uh,

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:02.000
create an illusion of 3d graphics in some games.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:07.000
They weren't invented by the guy who did marble madness, Mark Cerny.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Um,

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000
they use a shutter system to close the left and right lenses rapidly to

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
create a 3d effect.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Um,

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.000
the master system glasses can only be used with the original Sega master

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:21.000
system since it hooks up to the card port that does not exist on the master

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:22.000
system too.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Um,

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:27.000
it, uh, allows a 3d graphics in full color,

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:31.000
although it halves the frame weight because of the, uh,

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.000
the shutters and it can also produce a flicker.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:39.000
It also does not work very well with non CRT televisions.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Um,

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:46.000
they came out first in the UK in October, 1987 for a 39 pound 95.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Um,

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.000
North American release came out later that year.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Um,

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.000
3d glasses were also released in Japan, November, 1987,

01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:00.000
and they were bundled with Zaxxon 3d and then in Brazil and South Korea in

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
1989.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Now keep in mind, I guess for Brazil, you know,

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:07.000
cause the master system is still strong in Brazil.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000
It's a thing,

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:12.000
but the games that it's compatible with is Blade Eagle,

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Line of Fire for a master system, of course, Maze Hunter 3d,

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Missile Defense 3d, Outrun 3d, Poseidon Wars 3d,

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Space Harrier 3d and Zaxxon 3d.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Um,

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.000
we have a pair.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000
We,

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
I think we now have a TV that it,

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.000
that it works with.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Um,

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.000
but they're kind of like those big eighties.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.000
They look like,

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:37.000
like the over glasses that you wear over like prescription glasses,

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
but they're pretty cool.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Um,

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000
but yeah,

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.000
that's,

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:43.000
that's the thing.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.000
It is the,

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:45.000
uh, the glasses.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.000
That's really all I can say about it cause it didn't really do for many games,

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:51.000
but you get kind of this blinking effect on the screen cause they're gonna try

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000
to combine it.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
It's almost the same way.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
I think that it works on,

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.000
um,

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
the kind of the lenticular style,

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:01.000
right?

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Like,

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.000
um, the 3ds does.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Yeah.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
I think that with the shutters,

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.000
like,

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.000
um,

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.000
a lot of 3d TVs,

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
I think kind of use that same type of stuff now because I have a TV,

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.000
a 3d glasses that uses the shutter,

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.000
but it's all,

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
obviously the technology is very advanced,

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000
so it's kind of faster.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
You get the full frames and everything.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.000
When you're looking at the screen though,

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.000
without the glasses.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Yeah,

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:22.000
it's a little funny cause you have one,

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.000
but actually what I was noticing,

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.000
you can stare at the screen like it's one of those,

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.000
um, stereo pictures.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:28.000
You know what I'm talking about?

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Can you see the whale or whatever it was?

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Sailboat.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Sailboat.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Yeah.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.000
More of a schooner.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.000
But you can,

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.000
you can see it kind of hurts your eyes to do it for a while,

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
but like watching you cause obviously,

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Oh my gosh,

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.000
y'all were using YouTube's.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Um,

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:45.000
but watching this guy play on YouTube,

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.000
like if I stare just right,

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:47.000
I can see it in the 3d.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.000
So it's kind of,

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.000
yeah,

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.000
no glasses needed,

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:51.000
but it kind of hurts my eyes.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Yeah.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.000
You don't want to like,

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
you know how like they always say your face will freeze that way.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000
I'm making that face.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.000
I feel like my eyes are going to freeze.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
It's like when I would save my 3d animal crossing screenshots,

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
they were actually two pictures.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Yes.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:03.000
So it's the same effect.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.000
It's magic.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Yes it is.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.000
There it is.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.000
All right.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:08.000
So yeah,

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.000
there you go.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.000
There it is.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Your classic peripheral of the month for September confirmed August was the

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:13.000
sewing machine.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Oh,

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.000
that's my gosh.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Time flies.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Anyway,

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:18.000
there it is.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000
The classic peripheral of the month,

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
the Sega scope 3d glasses.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Um,

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
we have a little extra time here for the segments.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Since that didn't take you very long.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Um,

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:27.000
what else should we talk about?

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.000
How has some house?

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Wow.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Been treating you if,

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:31.000
if your journey,

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:32.000
your journey back,

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.000
I'm doing the Argus content.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Cause I kind of stopped playing for a little bit when that came out.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:36.000
So I'm really enjoying it.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Cause it's all,

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000
you know,

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.000
space,

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.000
self demon husband.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Um,

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.000
cause I'm an Illidan fangirl.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.000
So I've really been enjoying it.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Um,

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:45.000
I'm really enjoying the stories.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Cool single area back.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Are you playing with the game boy boys or like kind of being a loner?

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
The only person who I've seen on was spike.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Okay.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:53.000
So,

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.000
so,

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.000
um,

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.000
that spike gets around cause I saw him in overwatch the other day too.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:03.000
So I got a cappuccino today that they put an overwatch symbol on and cocoa.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000
What?

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.000
It was at this,

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:06.000
um,

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:07.000
comic book store.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Oh,

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Oh yeah.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:10.000
I know that place.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.000
The,

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.000
yes.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:13.000
I think it's overwatch.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.000
No,

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:17.000
the number one gaming podcast in town does stuff with that place.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000
So I'm not surprised at all.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Cause I know they're big overwatch fans over there.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.000
So what?

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Number one,

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.000
like P

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.000
no,

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:25.000
we're fans of everybody.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.000
We just have to be a little,

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.000
you know,

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000
I'm a shady fan.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Yeah.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000
But anyway,

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.000
in all seriousness,

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.000
I know what place you're talking about.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Yeah.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Yeah.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:35.000
So that's really cute.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.000
I like that.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.000
So,

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:38.000
um,

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:39.000
I have,

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000
I had an overwatch cappuccino and then,

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.000
um,

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:44.000
I saw the little mermaid at the crust theater and it was fun.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:45.000
That's fun.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Um,

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.000
you know what you didn't see?

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:48.000
That makes me sad.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:51.200
You did not see the mass effect voice actors panel that I did a dragon con and you need

01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:52.200
to,

01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:53.200
you need to,

01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:54.200
uh,

01:58:54.200 --> 01:58:55.200
I really,

01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:56.200
really,

01:58:56.200 --> 01:58:57.200
really bitter,

01:58:57.200 --> 01:58:58.200
like bad coffee,

01:58:58.200 --> 01:58:59.200
Rob.

01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:00.200
I really,

01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:01.200
really,

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:02.200
really want to get Courtney Taylor on the show.

01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:03.200
She did the voice of Jack.

01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:04.200
Um,

01:59:04.200 --> 01:59:05.200
she's got this great chair.

01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:06.200
I'll give it a shot.

01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:07.200
I'm going to give this a shout out for free cause I love what she's doing.

01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:08.200
Um,

01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:09.200
I know her and I think it's Mary Elizabeth McGlynn,

01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:10.200
uh,

01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:11.200
put on this nerds vote.

01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:12.200
Uh,

01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:13.200
so they're trying to,

01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:14.200
they go to conventions and they register nerds to vote.

01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:15.200
Um,

01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:16.200
you know,

01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:17.200
cause it's all about getting people where they're,

01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:18.200
they're not partisan.

01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:19.200
They're not going to tell you to register one way or the other.

01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:21.200
Make sure you get registered because,

01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:22.200
um,

01:59:22.200 --> 01:59:23.200
voting is like really important.

01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:25.200
I'll tell you who to vote for.

01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:26.200
Not right now though.

01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:27.200
I know you will.

01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:29.200
You reach out on Twitter and you'll happily say,

01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:30.200
but I'm,

01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:32.200
I'm pretty sure if you did reach out to these people,

01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:33.200
they would have their own opinions too.

01:59:33.200 --> 01:59:34.200
However,

01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:38.200
we put all that aside to just get people registered so that their voices can be

01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:39.200
heard.

01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:40.200
Just like Mr.

01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:41.200
voice is so loud right now.

01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:42.200
He's probably picking up on the,

01:59:42.200 --> 01:59:43.200
um,

01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:44.200
microphone.

01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:45.200
He's very upset about something.

01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:46.200
All right.

01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:47.200
Anyway,

01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:48.200
he got boob perching time,

01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:50.200
which by the way,

01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:51.200
if you guys don't know,

01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:52.200
Mr.

01:59:52.200 --> 01:59:53.200
Smoosh will hang out like Mr.

01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:54.200
Smoosh,

01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:55.200
you know,

01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:56.200
is usually not the pickup type of cat.

01:59:56.200 --> 01:59:57.200
I can't pick them up.

01:59:57.200 --> 01:59:58.200
Alan can't pick them up,

01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:00.200
but Jamie can pick up Mr.

02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:03.200
Smoosh because Jamie has a certain pair of boobs.

02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:04.200
Yes,

02:00:04.200 --> 02:00:05.200
she has boobs and triple D's.

02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:07.200
Apparently you can stand on them.

02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:08.200
Mr.

02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:11.200
Smoosh is very clearly a straight cat because he loves the boobs.

02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:12.200
I mean,

02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:13.200
even gay men like,

02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:14.200
I know I was gonna say,

02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:15.200
actually I know a lot of gay men that loves boobs,

02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:16.200
but he's,

02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:17.200
you know,

02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:19.200
he's very attached to your,

02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:20.200
your breath.

02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:22.200
I'm a little though angry with myself.

02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:23.200
Speaking of gay things.

02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:24.200
Okay.

02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:26.200
Cause I have something for you at my house.

02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:27.200
Have you,

02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:28.200
I got unicorn cereal.

02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:30.200
I think Kellogg's unicorn cereal.

02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:31.200
You sent me the text yesterday.

02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:32.200
It looks hilarious.

02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:33.200
Yes.

02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:34.200
It's on,

02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:35.200
it's on my table.

02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:36.200
I didn't go back home or I would have brought it.

02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:37.200
What do unicorns taste like?

02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:38.200
Rainbows and sheet cakes.

02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:40.200
I played a unicorn card game today.

02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:41.200
And I already forgot the name of it.

02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:42.200
Is it exploding?

02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:43.200
It's the,

02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:44.200
it's the exploding kittens,

02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:45.200
but the unicorn game.

02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:46.200
Like farting unicorns or something?

02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:47.200
No,

02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:48.200
it's a magical unicorns or something.

02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:49.200
I don't remember,

02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:50.200
but I won.

02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:51.200
It was fun.

02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:52.200
Well,

02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:53.200
I want to do a giveaway on the show.

02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:54.200
I haven't decided what,

02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:55.200
but I mean how,

02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:56.200
how to do it,

02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:57.200
but I know what I'm going to give.

02:00:57.200 --> 02:00:58.200
There's,

02:00:58.200 --> 02:00:59.200
there's always that point system on VOG for checking in and we haven't done the

02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:00.200
giveaway on there forever.

02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:02.200
I'm going to do a glitter pack from,

02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:03.200
uh,

02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:04.200
uh,

02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:05.200
cards against humanity.

02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:06.200
Oh,

02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:07.200
you're going to actually send.

02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:08.200
I have five of them and I'll give,

02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:10.200
I'll give one to a listener if they don't suck.

02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:11.200
Okay.

02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:12.200
Well,

02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:13.200
I do.

02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:14.200
Do you want them to tweet you or how do you want to do that?

02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:15.200
I'll figure it out.

02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:16.200
Just know that it's coming.

02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:19.200
Stay tuned for next week when Jamie like figures it out.

02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:20.200
All right.

02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:21.200
Anyway.

02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:22.200
Mail the mailbox and make Rob check it.

02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:23.200
He'll tell me.

02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:24.200
Participate at orangeonsharing.com.

02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:25.200
Okay.

02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:26.200
We're also brought Rob candy.

02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:28.200
We're here to wrap up the classic game of the week.

02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:29.200
So the Sega 3d glasses.

02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:30.200
Yes.

02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:31.200
Yes.

02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:32.200
All right.

02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:33.200
Uh,

02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:34.200
any last thoughts before we get back to the main show?

02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:35.200
I want Chinese food.

02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:36.200
That's it.

02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:44.200
Thank you,

02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:45.200
Jamie for the segment.

02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:47.200
We miss having her here live in studio,

02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:49.200
but I think she's going to be here at the end of the month.

02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:50.200
Uh,

02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:51.200
while she's still,

02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:52.200
you know,

02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:53.200
again,

02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:54.200
if you are not already aware,

02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:55.200
even though he said this on a show a million times,

02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:56.200
she has a conflict with her,

02:01:56.200 --> 02:01:57.200
you know,

02:01:57.200 --> 02:01:58.200
paying day job schedule.

02:01:58.200 --> 02:01:59.200
Unfortunately,

02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:00.200
she has to work Sundays right now,

02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:01.200
so she can't be with us during the live shows.

02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:02.200
So we're trying to at least still include her,

02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:03.200
uh,

02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:04.200
through,

02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:05.200
through the magic of radio,

02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:06.200
uh,

02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:07.200
with her classic game of the week segment.

02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:08.200
And then,

02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:09.200
um,

02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:10.200
hopefully we'll,

02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:11.200
you know,

02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:12.200
be able to have her here at least once a month.

02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:13.200
I know that's her plan.

02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:14.200
Um,

02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:16.200
we're going to get back into the show and we've still got a lot of news to

02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:17.200
come.

02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:18.200
We're running pretty long tonight,

02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:21.200
so we're going to try to try to catch up here a little bit,

02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:23.200
but we do still want to have plenty of time to take your calls.

02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:25.200
Orange lounge radio on Skype,

02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:26.200
uh,

02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:27.200
a little later in the show.

02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:28.200
Uh,

02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:29.200
also just a couple of quick things cause it was asked about,

02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:30.200
you know,

02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:33.200
cause obviously this whole announcement about the Twitch move eventually,

02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:34.200
um,

02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:35.200
is,

02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:36.200
you know,

02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:37.200
caused a lot of chat,

02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:38.200
which by the way,

02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:39.200
one way I also kind of explained this to somebody that I think may help you

02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:41.200
kind of understand where this is coming from,

02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:42.200
you know,

02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:43.200
why we're making a move like this.

02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:44.200
Just think about this.

02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:49.200
How many shout cast streams have you searched for to listen to in the past

02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:52.200
month versus how many Twitch streams have you looked for?

02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:56.200
And maybe the answer for you in particular is zero,

02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:59.200
but ask about 10 or 20 of your nerd friends,

02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:00.200
that same question.

02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:02.200
And I think you'll completely like,

02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:03.200
I think what's that?

02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:04.200
Which show cast?

02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:05.200
I know,

02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:06.200
right?

02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:07.200
Or are we talking about shot?

02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:09.200
Are we talking about a commentating over video games?

02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:10.200
Cause that's what they call that now.

02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:11.200
You know,

02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:12.200
one of Bobby's panels was about shout casting,

02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:13.200
but it was not,

02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:15.200
it was not the software.

02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:16.200
It was that's comp.

02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:18.200
That's what they call commentating over video games.

02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:20.200
So that was actually a really fascinating panel,

02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:21.200
by the way,

02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:22.200
I wish,

02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:24.200
I wish some of those would be online for you to listen to later,

02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:25.200
but I guess this is part of the reason you have to be there.

02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:26.200
Uh,

02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:27.200
anyhow,

02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:28.200
uh,

02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:29.200
fifth dream says,

02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:30.200
I forgot,

02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:31.200
we'll vog still be on tune in.

02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:32.200
Um,

02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:33.200
no,

02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:34.200
uh,

02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:35.200
when this goes into effect,

02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:36.200
uh,

02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:38.200
the goal is that that will be sunset it actually that because tune in is

02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:39.200
simply a shout cast directory,

02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:40.200
basically for that.

02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:41.200
Um,

02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:42.200
and that will be sunsetted.

02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:43.200
Um,

02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:44.200
so that is part of the change,

02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:45.200
uh,

02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:46.200
that's going to,

02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:47.200
uh,

02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:48.200
be,

02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:49.200
uh,

02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:50.200
coming into play here.

02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:51.200
Um,

02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:52.200
but then,

02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:53.200
uh,

02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:54.200
what else did I want to say there with,

02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:55.200
um,

02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:56.200
the questions and so forth that we were getting,

02:03:56.200 --> 02:03:57.200
um,

02:03:57.200 --> 02:03:58.200
uh,

02:03:58.200 --> 02:03:59.200
there was something else,

02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:00.200
so I guess I'll think of it later.

02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:01.200
Uh,

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:02.200
in the meantime,

02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:03.200
let's get into some rapid fire news.

02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:04.200
Uh,

02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:05.200
Oh,

02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:06.200
it was the Skype real quick.

02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:07.200
Uh,

02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:10.200
will we be able to show your video out on the video?

02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:11.200
Um,

02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:12.200
hypothetically,

02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:13.200
yes,

02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:15.200
I can't guarantee that's going to be in place day one,

02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:16.200
but that is,

02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:19.200
let me say the goal is to continue to take calls on Skype just as we always

02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:21.200
have been at least for now.

02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:22.200
Um,

02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:23.200
in all honesty,

02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:25.200
I'm aware a lot of Twitch people use discord to take their calls.

02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:26.200
Uh,

02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:28.200
it's something in the back of my mind,

02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:29.200
but one,

02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:32.200
one big change at a time is enough.

02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:35.200
Let's try to keep everything else normal for now.

02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:36.200
All right,

02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:37.200
let's move on.

02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:38.200
Uh,

02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:39.200
some rapid fire news.

02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:40.200
Loki.

02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:41.200
Uh,

02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:42.200
so,

02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:43.200
uh,

02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:45.200
Metro Metro Exodus has been delayed to 2019,

02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:47.200
which is kind of weird cause I thought it was coming out in 2019.

02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:49.200
I was unaware that it was actually scheduled for this year,

02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:53.200
but apparently it is going to be delayed.

02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:56.200
The development of Metro Exodus is progressing well.

02:04:56.200 --> 02:04:59.200
We are really excited by what we're seeing.

02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:00.200
We have constantly,

02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:01.200
um,

02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:05.200
we're constantly reviewing the games progress to ensure that we deliver a

02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:09.200
product that gamers and fans of the Metro series want and deserve.

02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:13.200
And as well as keeping an eye on announcements from our competitor,

02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:14.200
it ain't finished.

02:05:14.200 --> 02:05:16.200
Just put out a three WordPress release.

02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:17.200
It ain't finished.

02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:18.200
It's ambitious.

02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:19.200
We need more time.

02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:21.200
So Q1 2019,

02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:22.200
we,

02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:26.200
we don't want this game to turn out like mass effect Andromeda.

02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:27.200
So,

02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:29.200
which had already been delayed several times.

02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:32.200
We will just have to wait a little longer.

02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:33.200
All right.

02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:34.200
Um,

02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:39.200
and then something else that's going to be coming out on PlayStation VR is

02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:41.200
space shell five there.

02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:45.200
They have a version that's going to be coming out on PlayStation VR as well as

02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:46.200
the HTC Vive.

02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:47.200
Uh,

02:05:47.200 --> 02:05:50.200
no details yet on when we can expect that,

02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:55.200
but apparently they've had a VR version in the arcades in Japan for a while

02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:56.200
now.

02:05:56.200 --> 02:05:57.200
Um,

02:05:57.200 --> 02:05:59.200
and I think that the game is supposed to be,

02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:02.200
I don't know if it follows the exact,

02:06:02.200 --> 02:06:03.200
you know,

02:06:03.200 --> 02:06:05.200
format as the first game,

02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:06.200
but basically,

02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:07.200
you know,

02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:10.200
same premise and everything fighting the aliens and stuff like that rhythm

02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:11.200
game.

02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:12.200
Um,

02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:14.200
I'll definitely check it out when it comes out over here,

02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:16.200
whenever that is,

02:06:16.200 --> 02:06:19.200
I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:20.200
All right.

02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:21.200
Well,

02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:22.200
let's move on.

02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:23.200
So you remember,

02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:24.200
um,

02:06:24.200 --> 02:06:25.200
it was on the last episode of OLR before we took a,

02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:26.200
the break here,

02:06:26.200 --> 02:06:28.200
but we talked about how the last remnant was going to be delisted from the

02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:29.200
Xbox.

02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:30.200
Yes.

02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:31.200
Or as you know,

02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:32.200
it was delisted from steam.

02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:33.200
It was delisted from the Xbox.

02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:34.200
We never really got an answer on that,

02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:35.200
but,

02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:36.200
uh,

02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:37.200
we know the physical edition is available.

02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:38.200
Well,

02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:39.200
I think we figured out why,

02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:42.200
because the last remnant remastered is on its way for the PlayStation four.

02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:43.200
That is something that,

02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:44.200
uh,

02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:45.200
they announced this week.

02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:46.200
Uh,

02:06:46.200 --> 02:06:47.200
I don't know though.

02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:49.200
Is this something that like we need Loki?

02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:51.200
Is this a game that needs to be remastered?

02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:52.200
I don't know.

02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:53.200
No,

02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:54.200
not really,

02:06:54.200 --> 02:06:55.200
but hell they're remastered all the other games.

02:06:55.200 --> 02:06:56.200
So why not?

02:06:56.200 --> 02:06:57.200
Yeah.

02:06:57.200 --> 02:06:58.200
Why not?

02:06:58.200 --> 02:06:59.200
Right.

02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:00.200
So anyway,

02:07:00.200 --> 02:07:01.200
I can't think of anything to make.

02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:03.200
This will be a PlayStation four exclusive,

02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:04.200
uh,

02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:05.200
and it's going to be out worldwide on December 6th.

02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:07.200
And I believe it is only something you can download.

02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:08.200
It's not going to be something you can,

02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:09.200
uh,

02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:10.200
go buy in a store.

02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:11.200
So,

02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:12.200
uh,

02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:13.200
check that out.

02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:14.200
I suppose if that's something that you're into.

02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:17.200
Also a follow up on a game we talked about a long time ago on this show,

02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:21.200
you'd have to go all the way back to episode 571.

02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:25.200
When we had the developer of time spinner on this game on the show,

02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:26.200
you remember time spinner,

02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:27.200
uh,

02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:28.200
time spinner,

02:07:28.200 --> 02:07:29.200
uh,

02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:31.200
the date for a PlayStation four Vita and PC.

02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:33.200
It is finally coming out,

02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:34.200
which is a great news.

02:07:34.200 --> 02:07:35.200
They are,

02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:36.200
were announced for,

02:07:36.200 --> 02:07:37.200
I think,

02:07:37.200 --> 02:07:38.200
um,

02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:39.200
let's see,

02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:40.200
what is the big,

02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:41.200
I'm trying to find the date that was actually announced here.

02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:42.200
Uh,

02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:44.200
because we started seeing some of the trailers and stuff.

02:07:44.200 --> 02:07:45.200
There it is.

02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:46.200
Thank you.

02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:47.200
September 25th,

02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:48.200
uh,

02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:49.200
is the day that this will be out.

02:07:49.200 --> 02:07:50.200
Uh,

02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:51.200
obviously that was,

02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:52.200
that was a while ago that we did in this interview.

02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:53.200
So I know this game has been in development for a while,

02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:54.200
but,

02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:55.200
uh,

02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:56.200
it's,

02:07:56.200 --> 02:07:57.200
I,

02:07:57.200 --> 02:07:58.200
I think,

02:07:58.200 --> 02:07:59.200
uh,

02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:00.200
it's,

02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:01.200
it's,

02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:02.200
uh,

02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:03.200
it's been on the show and it's like,

02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:04.200
it's him.

02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:05.200
And he's contracted a few of the things out,

02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:06.200
I think,

02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:07.200
but for the most part,

02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:08.200
it's him developing the game.

02:08:08.200 --> 02:08:09.200
So,

02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:10.200
um,

02:08:10.200 --> 02:08:11.200
you know,

02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:12.200
it's been taken time because it's a lot of work for one person.

02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:13.200
So it's great to see that it's,

02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:14.200
uh,

02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:15.200
finally,

02:08:15.200 --> 02:08:16.200
uh,

02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:17.200
on its way to be done and he'll get to see everybody,

02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:18.200
hopefully,

02:08:18.200 --> 02:08:19.200
uh,

02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:20.200
really enjoy this game.

02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:21.200
It looks great.

02:08:21.200 --> 02:08:22.200
Like as far as like the pixel art and everything,

02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:23.200
it really looks gorgeous.

02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:24.200
So,

02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:25.200
uh,

02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:26.200
really happy for Bodie.

02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:27.200
Can't wait to play it myself.

02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:28.200
I was up in Seattle once.

02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:29.200
It's great.

02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:30.200
Really nice guy.

02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:31.200
So very happy for his,

02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:32.200
um,

02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:33.200
success.

02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:34.200
Hope he,

02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:35.200
hope he does very well with time spinner.

02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:36.200
I'll have to see if you come back on the show.

02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:37.200
Once the game is released,

02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:38.200
I think that would be a lot of fun.

02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:39.200
All right.

02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:40.200
Let's see what's going to be out a little sooner though.

02:08:40.200 --> 02:08:41.200

02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:42.200
as in next week,

02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:44.200
as we travel around the world and check out what's coming out in stores.

02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:45.200
Yes.

02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:50.200

02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:12.200
you know,

02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:14.200
we love those war SIM strategy games.

02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:17.200
So there's tanks and planes who doesn't love tanks and planes and blown them

02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:18.200
up.

02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:19.200
So you can do that on the switch this week.

02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:20.200
Uh,

02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:21.200
Loki,

02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:22.200
how about the UK with a dark soccer being out?

02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:23.200
Uh,

02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:24.200
we've got Tom Clancy's ghost recam,

02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:25.200
wild lands,

02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:27.200
year two gold edition.

02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:28.200
Come on.

02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:29.200
You're too gold edition.

02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:31.200
You can't fucking do that shit.

02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:32.200
That,

02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:33.200
that.

02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:35.200
So now this game of the year and game of the next year.

02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:36.200
Hey,

02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:37.200
we're,

02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:38.200
we're gaming the year twice in a row.

02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:40.200
You can't fucking whatever.

02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:41.200
I guess they make their own rules up.

02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:46.200
That's coming out on PlayStation four and Xbox one fishing SIM world on a

02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:49.200
PlayStation four and Xbox one candle,

02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:54.200
the power of the flame that's on PlayStation four and the switch little

02:11:55.200 --> 02:11:59.200
dragons cafe on the PlayStation four and the switch broken sword five,

02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:00.200
the servant's curse.

02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:01.200
Also on the switch,

02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:05.200
the banner saga trilogy on the switch,

02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:07.200
uh,

02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:12.200
four 28 Shibuya scramble on PlayStation four and that's it.

02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:14.200
Okay,

02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:16.200
let's get to the emails.

02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:25.200
Every week you guys email us,

02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:26.200
participate at orange laundry,

02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:29.200
do.com and we read some of our favorites here on the show.

02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:30.200
And as you can,

02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:31.200
Ooh,

02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:32.200
excuse me,

02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:33.200
hiccups.

02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:34.200
As you can imagine,

02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:36.200
we have a little bit of a backlog cause we haven't been here for a bit.

02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:37.200
So I've got some old emails.

02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:40.200
I got some dusty ass emails to read for you tonight,

02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:42.200
but they're all good and they deserve their attention.

02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:45.200
So if you want to email us something new and modern and sleek,

02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:48.200
you can participate at orange lounge radio.com.

02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:50.200
So this email is from September 5th.

02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:52.200
I'm going to tell you what day they're from because some of the news and

02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:53.200
things may have changed.

02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:55.200
These emails are getting old at this point.

02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:56.200
So,

02:12:56.200 --> 02:12:57.200
but you know,

02:12:57.200 --> 02:12:58.200
nobody knew that we wouldn't have a show last week.

02:12:58.200 --> 02:12:59.200
So anyway,

02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:00.200
uh,

02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:03.200
this email from September 5th is from Frodo swagons who says Frodo swagons

02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:04.200
here.

02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:05.200
I'll keep it short and sweet.

02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:06.200
Damn it sucks.

02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:07.200
There was no show over labor day weekend.

02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:10.200
I could have finally been in the live chat room because I had time off work

02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:11.200
frowny face,

02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:12.200
but that's okay.

02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:14.200
Dragon con must've been a blast.

02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:15.200
Spoiler alert.

02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:18.200
It was a hope you and Bobby had a good old time.

02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:19.200
Spoiler alert.

02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:20.200
We did.

02:13:20.200 --> 02:13:21.200
Uh,

02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:25.200
finally you should totally get that Julian kid back on the show.

02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:26.200
I think that was his name.

02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:27.200
That was quite entertaining.

02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:28.200
Yes,

02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:29.200
that was,

02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:30.200
um,

02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:31.200
Jamie's BFF Becky.

02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:32.200
That is her kid Julian.

02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:33.200
And it's been about a year,

02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:34.200
right?

02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:35.200
So we,

02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:37.200
we might stand to have a check in with Julian at some point,

02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:38.200
see what he's playing now.

02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:39.200
Anyway,

02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:40.200
uh,

02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:42.200
no inter- taining a fucking fish rod controller.

02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:43.200
That was,

02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:44.200
um,

02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:45.200
something that he had exclaimed on that.

02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:46.200
That I believe,

02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:47.200
uh,

02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:47.700
Rob,

02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:50.200
wear a diaper next time he comes on because you were losing your shit.

02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:51.200
Well,

02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:52.200
that kids are funny,

02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:53.200
uh,

02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:54.200
which made me lose my shit because your laugh is contagious.

02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:55.200
Thank you.

02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:56.200
Anyway,

02:13:56.200 --> 02:13:57.200
Miss you.

02:13:57.200 --> 02:13:58.200
Jamie Summers,

02:13:58.200 --> 02:13:59.200
uh,

02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:00.200
Loki.

02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:01.200
Keep up the Nintendo rants.

02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:02.200
I hope you're satisfied tonight.

02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:03.200
Uh,

02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:04.200
and Rob,

02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:05.200
you should totally stream more fist bump.

02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:06.200
I'm trying buddy.

02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:07.200
I'm trying.

02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:08.200
Um,

02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:09.200
if all my issues are not miraculously,

02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:13.640
miraculously cured when Comcast comes out for the second time on Tuesday, you

02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:17.240
can expect I'll probably do some more video-on-demand stuff. So, I mean, I did

02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:20.560
one video pre-recorded today, so you can check that out on my channel over at

02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:24.520
Rob Roberts. So if you want to see me lamenting about internet issues while I

02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:27.760
play World of Warcraft, you can see that. And I might do more of that if I have to.

02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:32.320
Let's get to an email from Robert M. on Friday, August 31st. So this would have

02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:36.280
been while I was away at DragonCon. So Robert M. says, it's only tangentially

02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:39.040
related to gaming, which I assume his voice in the soon-to-be-available

02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:45.800
Spider-Man game, spoiler alert, it's out. That game was released, and apparently

02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:49.640
it's really good. It is, and I've been on the fence of buying it, because I buy a

02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:52.920
lot of games and I don't end up playing them, and they're, like, I buy good games

02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:57.480
and don't end up playing them. Like, that's why I didn't buy God of War, and that's why I

02:14:57.480 --> 02:15:00.320
haven't bought Spider-Man yet, although I am on the fence on it. It looks pretty good.

02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:04.200
The only thing for me is that I don't get as into the comic book stuff as

02:15:04.200 --> 02:15:07.280
other people do. I'm not a hater, I just don't, like, I don't have that. I don't

02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:10.600
think you necessarily need to be a fan of that. Yeah, I'm hearing it's basically

02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:17.160
Arkham Asylum and those games, but Spider-Man. And I love those Batman games. There's a lot of, like, the costumes you can unlock and stuff through the

02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:20.720
game. You can unlock a bunch of stuff in the comics, but I don't think you

02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:26.120
necessarily need to be, like, a super fan of Spider-Man to be able to enjoy it. Yeah, no, you really don't. So, I mean,

02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:30.380
here, honestly, this is what did it. It came out the same day as Dragon Quest 11,

02:15:30.380 --> 02:15:34.660
and I'm looking at him going, I already am terrible about finishing games, and

02:15:34.660 --> 02:15:38.140
Dragon Quest 11 is going to be a 100 hour game. That's what, that's what I

02:15:38.140 --> 02:15:42.500
believe it's quoted as. So, the main quest is somewhere around, like, 100 hours. So,

02:15:42.500 --> 02:15:46.300
you know, that, that kind of made my decision for me. But with as much love

02:15:46.300 --> 02:15:48.700
as Spider-Man's getting and everything that's being shared out there and all

02:15:48.700 --> 02:15:56.500
the people streaming it and stuff, I'm tempted. I'm tempted. Anyway, let's see. The

02:15:56.500 --> 02:15:59.900
soon-to-be-available Spider-Man game. Ah, yes. But I have been wondering for a while, who

02:15:59.940 --> 02:16:04.380
is the Stan Lee of Detective Comics? I'm not trying to overlook Jack Kirby's

02:16:04.380 --> 02:16:07.720
importance to Marvel, of course, and one could very well say Stan Lee is

02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:10.740
literally the Stan Lee of Detective Comics, since he has apparently worked

02:16:10.740 --> 02:16:15.100
with DC, but that's probably not what I'm asking. Is there a Bob Kane slash Bill

02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:19.540
Finger, a Jerry Siegel, you can tell my comic book knowledge is not very good,

02:16:19.540 --> 02:16:25.260
slash Joel Shuster? Who has that level of prominence, or is that indicative of the

02:16:25.260 --> 02:16:30.420
studio's problems? Well, if my only, my only basis on that is with the Lego

02:16:30.420 --> 02:16:36.620
games, and I don't, their equivalent, because Stan Lee was like the, you know,

02:16:36.620 --> 02:16:41.260
collectible guy that was in all of the, you know, Lego Marvel games, and then the

02:16:41.260 --> 02:16:49.020
DC side, it was Adam West. So, that doesn't really work now. I don't really think

02:16:49.020 --> 02:16:54.180
there is anybody that's kind of like that. But then again, I'm not a huge DC fan, so

02:16:54.220 --> 02:16:59.580
fuck if I know. That, that DC side's all fucking mess right now. At least in the,

02:16:59.580 --> 02:17:05.100
like, entertainment world, it's just kind of, they don't know what the fuck they're

02:17:05.100 --> 02:17:09.380
doing. Okay, so thank, thank God to having a chat room that can help me out here,

02:17:09.380 --> 02:17:13.060
because I don't know a lot about comics. Fifth Dream in chat says, DC doesn't have

02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:17.980
that face. Ironically, closest thing is another Lee, Jim, and Captain Spike agrees

02:17:17.980 --> 02:17:21.300
that I was gonna say Jim Lee. Captain Spike also saying, I'm trying to play

02:17:21.340 --> 02:17:27.820
Spidey and Dragon Quest XI. Both amazing games paired with, wow, I'm so game ADD

02:17:27.820 --> 02:17:32.500
right now. You know, hashtag the struggle. Tiger Claw says, there's a Stan Lee cameo

02:17:32.500 --> 02:17:35.620
in Spider-Man. Of course there is. Of course there is. So, there you go. You know,

02:17:35.620 --> 02:17:41.100
speaking of, Matt, here's how I can tie it. There was a Stan Lee cameo in the Teen

02:17:41.100 --> 02:17:44.700
Titans Go movie. There's a Stan Lee cameo in everything. And it was hilarious. All

02:17:44.700 --> 02:17:47.300
right, there's gonna be a Stan Lee cameo on this show, hopefully, before it ends.

02:17:47.740 --> 02:17:52.380
All right, so here's the thing. Here's the thing. One thing I can talk about is the

02:17:52.380 --> 02:17:57.020
video game stuff. And what about like faces of companies? Because like with

02:17:57.020 --> 02:18:03.060
Nintendo, you've got like, you know, obviously, Miyamoto, Reggie Fils-Aime, you

02:18:03.060 --> 02:18:07.420
know, when, why many people were so effective when Iwata passed as he was

02:18:07.420 --> 02:18:10.620
really, you know, the face when it came to the directs and so forth. And they have,

02:18:10.620 --> 02:18:14.620
they have Nintendo has a new president now. That was him in that direct, wasn't

02:18:14.620 --> 02:18:18.460
it? That led that direct. That was the new Nintendo president, wasn't it? It

02:18:18.460 --> 02:18:21.500
looked like him. I didn't, the problem is I didn't catch the very, very beginning.

02:18:21.500 --> 02:18:27.540
Maybe somebody else can. Yeah. Um, but anyway. Oh yes. Thank you. Bobby Blackwolf

02:18:27.540 --> 02:18:30.220
does confirm it was the new president. Cause I remember they had picked a

02:18:30.220 --> 02:18:34.300
younger guy and you know, so that was him. So anyway. Um, so you know, Nintendo

02:18:34.300 --> 02:18:37.460
kind of has our faces. Microsoft has like, I don't know, like Major Nelson,

02:18:37.700 --> 02:18:39.780
especially when it comes to like social media, it's kind of like the face of

02:18:39.780 --> 02:18:47.820
Microsoft. What does Sony have? Ridge Racer. I guess like it's Ridge Racer.

02:18:47.860 --> 02:18:52.660
There's the whole PlayStation blog folks, you know, there's a variety, there's a

02:18:52.660 --> 02:18:56.620
whole variety. There's people there, you know, they, and they kind of, you know, I

02:18:56.620 --> 02:18:59.820
don't know, like you see them at E3, but they're, you know, they got the, they got

02:18:59.820 --> 02:19:04.380
the stuff that they have online parody account, but then that's gone. Yeah. So

02:19:04.380 --> 02:19:07.300
what do they have left? Nothing. I don't know. Like it's just, I don't know. It

02:19:07.300 --> 02:19:11.380
doesn't feel the same. It's not one person. It's, it's a, you have to

02:19:11.380 --> 02:19:14.740
understand that the PlayStation brand is so strong. They don't need

02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:18.780
representatives like that to help bolster the, you know, the appearance of

02:19:18.780 --> 02:19:21.660
the PlayStation brand, the PlayStation branches. It's, it's its own

02:19:21.660 --> 02:19:26.820
spokesperson. But that being said though, the best spokesperson that they

02:19:26.820 --> 02:19:31.940
had was the fake CEO or whatever. No, uh, the vice president, the fake vice

02:19:31.940 --> 02:19:37.020
president guy that was, uh, he was an actor. It was, I forget his name, but

02:19:37.020 --> 02:19:41.100
like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Fucking awesome. They just made him the real vice

02:19:41.100 --> 02:19:46.940
president cause he's fucking Kevin Butler is long live Kevin Butler. Um,

02:19:46.940 --> 02:19:52.220
let's see, uh, Sony has David Jaffe says, uh, Bobby black Wolf. I don't know

02:19:52.220 --> 02:19:57.820
if that's the same thing though. Anyway, I guess it doesn't really matter. I'm

02:19:57.820 --> 02:20:01.100
just getting curious. Video games kind of have their faces too. All right,

02:20:01.340 --> 02:20:05.660
let's get to an email from the day before the canceled show. So September

02:20:05.660 --> 02:20:10.500
8th and this is from while I are who says, hello, LR, by the time you read

02:20:10.500 --> 02:20:12.980
this, I'll finally have caught up on the episodes I missed while we had a

02:20:12.980 --> 02:20:16.380
newborn. Well, babies are important. Uh, but of course I had the email about

02:20:16.380 --> 02:20:19.780
some things you probably forgot about already during rapid fire news in early

02:20:19.780 --> 02:20:24.300
August. I can't remember last week. Here's the email where you get called

02:20:24.300 --> 02:20:30.300
out on all this shit we did wrong over the guys in episode two. I have the

02:20:30.340 --> 02:20:36.540
following list of problematic incidents from the past. I'm teasing why we love

02:20:36.540 --> 02:20:40.020
why we'll allow it. Yeah, we're only allowing it because of why we are all

02:20:40.020 --> 02:20:44.740
right during rapid fire news. Sorry, probably black hole says this is an

02:20:44.740 --> 02:20:50.220
airing of grievances. All right, no, you're wrong. That's an Aaron of

02:20:50.220 --> 02:20:55.460
grievance. Okay, here comes why we are during rapid fire news in early August.

02:20:55.500 --> 02:21:00.380
Loki expressed enthusiasm at the success of indie 3d platformer a hat in

02:21:00.380 --> 02:21:04.700
time and said he was looking forward to trying it himself. Before that happens, I

02:21:04.700 --> 02:21:07.580
want to make sure you're aware of some issues with the people behind the game.

02:21:07.700 --> 02:21:13.060
Oh shit, this really is about problematic stuff. Oh, that'll teach me

02:21:13.060 --> 02:21:16.940
to make a joke before I read the rest. Let's go. Let's hear about it. All

02:21:16.940 --> 02:21:20.460
right here. First of all, you may remember someone by the name of John

02:21:20.460 --> 02:21:25.140
Jafari, or perhaps you know him by his nickname, John Tron. Oh, I've heard

02:21:25.140 --> 02:21:29.380
of it. I already know where this is going now. Uh, if you need a refresher,

02:21:29.380 --> 02:21:32.660
he's a popular YouTube personality. And early last year, there was a bit of

02:21:32.660 --> 02:21:36.180
an uproar when he went on several openly racist rants. You may also

02:21:36.180 --> 02:21:39.820
remember the indie platformer ukulele had cast John Tron to deliver some

02:21:39.820 --> 02:21:43.020
voice work for the game following his racist rants and the outcry that

02:21:43.020 --> 02:21:46.380
followed the ukulele developers did the right thing and scrubbed John Tron's

02:21:46.380 --> 02:21:49.940
voice in the game. Guess what? John Tron also did voice work for a hat in

02:21:49.940 --> 02:21:52.580
time. You'd expect that the folks in charge of this game would have done

02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:55.660
the right thing. But not only did they not remove his voice, they never

02:21:55.660 --> 02:21:59.260
even offered a statement regarding John Tron as racist behavior or their

02:21:59.260 --> 02:22:02.060
decision to keep his voice in their game. I interpret this as an

02:22:02.060 --> 02:22:05.140
acceptance or perhaps even an endorsement of this behavior by the

02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:08.380
games lead developers. If this wasn't enough, you should also know that the

02:22:08.380 --> 02:22:11.020
lead game designer was previously involved in a dispute with a former

02:22:11.020 --> 02:22:14.580
colleague. When the dispute was not resolved to their liking, they decided

02:22:14.580 --> 02:22:18.060
to create a slander website for the purpose of doxing this person

02:22:18.260 --> 02:22:22.260
prominently featuring their personal contact information. Now I'm sure that

02:22:22.260 --> 02:22:25.420
many other people contributed a lot of hard work to this game artists,

02:22:25.420 --> 02:22:28.580
musicians, other voice actors, programmers, designers and so forth.

02:22:28.740 --> 02:22:31.540
But it's likely that they've already been paid for their work. And then

02:22:31.540 --> 02:22:33.940
when you buy a copy of this game, the money is going to the people at the

02:22:33.940 --> 02:22:37.540
top of it. Exactly the people who I don't want to give my money to. So I

02:22:37.540 --> 02:22:40.860
will never buy it. I will never play it. I've been trying my best to spread

02:22:40.860 --> 02:22:43.340
the word about it. And I encourage potential buyers to take their money

02:22:43.340 --> 02:22:46.420
somewhere elsewhere instead. Let me ask you a tricky quote because the

02:22:46.420 --> 02:22:49.500
rest of his email gets another point. Why is Mr. Smoosh jumping up on the

02:22:49.500 --> 02:22:53.500
table like he's going to jump up on Loki's little mini table there that he

02:22:53.500 --> 02:22:56.820
uses with his laptop? Maybe he will. Maybe he will. All right. Let's see

02:22:56.820 --> 02:22:59.860
what happens. I think he might know. He's like, fuck that. All right. I'm

02:22:59.860 --> 02:23:05.660
sorry. Sorry. My cat is far more interesting than fucking racist assholes

02:23:05.660 --> 02:23:11.860
on the internet. Anyway. Okay. So Loki, let me ask you this question. Is it

02:23:11.860 --> 02:23:15.700
then acceptable to steal the game under these circumstances? Is piracy

02:23:15.700 --> 02:23:18.420
justified in this case? No, don't answer that. Don't answer. That's a

02:23:18.420 --> 02:23:21.060
slippery slope. I don't want to go down. I don't answer it. Don't. It's

02:23:21.060 --> 02:23:24.980
the same reason. Like, you know, I'm still going to watch like mission

02:23:24.980 --> 02:23:29.140
impossible, even though I don't necessarily, I don't endorse, you know,

02:23:29.140 --> 02:23:34.260
Scientology or anything like that. When, when can I like draw the line

02:23:34.260 --> 02:23:37.420
between the people that make the content and the content itself? Like,

02:23:37.420 --> 02:23:40.620
when can I just say, I just want to enjoy the content without the drama

02:23:40.620 --> 02:23:43.980
behind the content? Like, I don't need to know the personal backgrounds of

02:23:44.060 --> 02:23:46.460
all these, which is why you said you were interested in the game in the

02:23:46.460 --> 02:23:48.980
first place, because you had no idea about any of this stuff. You're just

02:23:48.980 --> 02:23:53.620
like, Oh, this looks neat. Exactly. Like, I, I don't need that. I don't

02:23:53.620 --> 02:23:56.020
need to know the resumes of all the people that fucking worked at the

02:23:56.020 --> 02:23:59.660
country and all, or the company and all the bad shit that they did here. So

02:23:59.660 --> 02:24:02.380
there's enough bad shit out there. There is, there is a lot of bad shit

02:24:02.380 --> 02:24:05.980
out here. And like, it's like, I totally kind of get what YYR is saying.

02:24:05.980 --> 02:24:08.260
Like now that I'm hearing all this, I'm like, well, I didn't know much

02:24:08.260 --> 02:24:11.740
about this game and now I don't really want to, well, you're probably in

02:24:11.740 --> 02:24:14.340
luck because I'm going to be probably too lazy to buy it. Anyway,

02:24:14.340 --> 02:24:17.060
unless it comes in a humble bundle sale or something like that. So it's

02:24:17.060 --> 02:24:19.940
fine. I probably won't end up actually playing it. I just said it looked

02:24:19.940 --> 02:24:23.460
neat. Like I saw it actually was on sale this week and I was like, yeah,

02:24:23.500 --> 02:24:28.460
not, not sale enough. So I, I didn't end up purchasing it, but it still

02:24:28.460 --> 02:24:31.220
looks neat. But once again, it's a neat game that I'm not going to have

02:24:31.220 --> 02:24:35.060
time to play anyway. So, you know, there's a lot of other neat games that

02:24:35.060 --> 02:24:38.780
come out before that. We think, you know, Spiderman, red dead redemption

02:24:38.780 --> 02:24:41.820
right around the fucking corner. Like Jesus Christ, never going to have

02:24:41.820 --> 02:24:43.020
time to play any of these games.

02:24:43.100 --> 02:24:47.980
Can everybody just try harder to not be an asshole? Like how, like, do you,

02:24:48.020 --> 02:24:52.860
do you know how easy it is to not say racist things? It's really easy.

02:24:53.140 --> 02:24:56.220
Don't say them. You just don't say them.

02:24:56.220 --> 02:24:58.140
But then I have to stop taking my ambient.

02:25:01.420 --> 02:25:05.620
No Loki. That's not how it works. Ambien does not make you racist. Ambien

02:25:05.620 --> 02:25:08.180
does not make you racist contrary to what some, you know, former

02:25:08.180 --> 02:25:12.260
entertainers, uh, from yesteryear will try to tell you. Just, just why,

02:25:12.820 --> 02:25:16.620
just can't people in general, just like not be racist. Like it's really

02:25:16.620 --> 02:25:22.300
easy to not be racist. You just don't be racist and don't commit sexual

02:25:22.300 --> 02:25:27.900
assault. Yes. That's yeah. They don't, don't rape. I mean, it's such a, I

02:25:27.900 --> 02:25:30.700
mean, I know we don't teach people this. What we do teach people is how

02:25:30.700 --> 02:25:33.940
to avoid being raped, but what we should teach people is like, maybe

02:25:33.940 --> 02:25:37.500
just maybe don't do that. Don't. And like, I'm, I'm, I'm not trying to

02:25:37.500 --> 02:25:39.980
make light of it. Like, this isn't even a joke. I'm like saying, don't,

02:25:39.980 --> 02:25:43.500
don't do it. You all know. I know you all are, you guys listening out there.

02:25:43.500 --> 02:25:49.500
Remember the three R's. Okay. The three R's don't rape. Don't be racist.

02:25:49.700 --> 02:25:55.180
Don't rep for Scientology. Okay. I kind of think two of those things are

02:25:55.180 --> 02:25:58.820
far worse than one, but a fair enough. All right. Uh, let's see. Going to

02:25:58.820 --> 02:26:02.980
chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Uh, Puba in chat says everyone has

02:26:02.980 --> 02:26:05.900
their personal subjective lines. I think it's okay for YYR to boycott.

02:26:05.900 --> 02:26:10.300
And I think it's okay to low key to not care. Um, and what's interesting,

02:26:10.300 --> 02:26:13.980
YYR says, I'll eat Chick-fil-A when they're open on Sunday. So Jesus

02:26:13.980 --> 02:26:16.940
Christ, I wish they would open on Sunday because they're just pretty

02:26:16.940 --> 02:26:21.340
good. Like, I don't get why they, so here's the thing, and this might

02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:25.020
surprise you. I'm not one of those people that's up and up to like, I'm

02:26:25.020 --> 02:26:28.940
not, even though I get that Chick-fil-A has their, their president has

02:26:28.940 --> 02:26:32.780
donated money to anti LGBT causes. And I think that's fucking gross.

02:26:33.100 --> 02:26:36.140
I think a lot of people have donated money to anti LGBT causes and that's

02:26:36.140 --> 02:26:41.860
also fucking gross. And what works is education. The boycotts don't

02:26:41.860 --> 02:26:45.580
really work in that regard. I mean, and that's kind of on both sides of

02:26:45.580 --> 02:26:49.260
the fence, like the Chick-fil-A slot or, or look, look at Nike. Their

02:26:49.260 --> 02:26:52.780
shares are up like 34 or there. Yeah. Their, their stock value is up like

02:26:52.780 --> 02:26:57.180
34% with all those people like burning their shoes and shit because, which

02:26:57.180 --> 02:27:03.700
by the way, remember what we said, don't be racist. But anyway, um, trying

02:27:03.700 --> 02:27:06.140
to, try to avoid a slippery slope, but it's really hard sometimes you

02:27:06.140 --> 02:27:10.660
guys. Uh, anyway, my, my thought with the whole Chick-fil-A thing is I, I

02:27:10.660 --> 02:27:14.140
do eat Chick-fil-A because here's the thing, like the local franchise

02:27:14.140 --> 02:27:17.020
owner, and you can look this up for yourself, actually donates to pro

02:27:17.020 --> 02:27:21.260
LGBT causes here locally to offset some of the stuff that the corporate

02:27:21.260 --> 02:27:26.060
does. I have many gay friends who worked at Chick-fil-A who've said

02:27:26.060 --> 02:27:29.340
that their experiences were actually really positive. They were treated

02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:32.980
well and all this other stuff. So like, I'm not, excuse me, I, I hate, I

02:27:32.980 --> 02:27:36.500
hate the fact that the money has gone to anti LGBT causes, but I have

02:27:36.500 --> 02:27:41.820
also seen just from myself that, um, I have been able to change many more

02:27:41.820 --> 02:27:46.460
minds by sharing my story, by sharing like who I am and the fact that

02:27:46.540 --> 02:27:51.340
being gay is not a choice. It is the way that, you know, the, the same

02:27:51.340 --> 02:27:54.860
God that you believe in made me just like he made you and all that stuff.

02:27:54.860 --> 02:27:58.140
And, and these things are, are, you know, it's, it's my life that people

02:27:58.140 --> 02:28:02.140
are trying to, you know, be against with, with things like conversion

02:28:02.140 --> 02:28:05.820
therapy and all this garbage stuff out there. I think education goes a

02:28:05.820 --> 02:28:09.740
much farther way than you're canceled because you eat Chick-fil-A.

02:28:11.380 --> 02:28:14.060
That's just kind of my take on the whole thing. I would rather educate

02:28:14.060 --> 02:28:19.380
people as to why, you know, anti LGBT causes are, uh, honestly, it's a

02:28:19.380 --> 02:28:23.460
waste of money in one regard. But anyway, that's a whole nother thing.

02:28:24.420 --> 02:28:28.620
Uh, act-deaf in chat says, I know many LGBT people that go to Coachella

02:28:28.620 --> 02:28:31.140
each year, despite the parent company that owns the festival, donates to

02:28:31.140 --> 02:28:36.860
anti LGBT causes. Um, so you know what, and, and, and, and honestly, if

02:28:36.860 --> 02:28:40.020
you're going to send that email to me that talks about how you can't

02:28:40.020 --> 02:28:42.420
believe that I just sat here and said, sure, I'll eat Chick-fil-A.

02:28:42.420 --> 02:28:45.540
Okay. I don't eat it every day. Uh, but I'll eat it once in a while.

02:28:45.700 --> 02:28:49.460
Uh, if you're about to send me that thing, um, just know you're giving me

02:28:49.460 --> 02:28:52.300
an invite to come through your house so I can point out everything

02:28:52.300 --> 02:28:57.260
problematic that you own. I think in my, my mind, I guess my point is

02:28:57.260 --> 02:29:00.980
the question is not like the boycotting and the don't do this. And that's

02:29:00.980 --> 02:29:04.940
like, that's only going to go so far. What are we really doing to change

02:29:04.940 --> 02:29:08.300
minds? Cause honestly, one of the first things I'm always going to ask

02:29:08.300 --> 02:29:10.540
you when you tell me there's like a problem with the world, so I'm going

02:29:10.540 --> 02:29:12.780
to say, do you vote? Did you vote?

02:29:12.820 --> 02:29:16.700
Well, and the other thing too, like, not this, not to like play down

02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:22.140
anything. I think there's these issues are out there. They've been

02:29:22.140 --> 02:29:25.900
always out there. It's just now it's more prevalent because of social

02:29:25.900 --> 02:29:30.420
media. Like I wouldn't say, I'm not going to say that all of the game

02:29:30.420 --> 02:29:33.380
companies and all the games beforehand, all the teams that have worked

02:29:33.380 --> 02:29:38.060
on, they've been squeaky clean and we should, we avoid games based on

02:29:38.060 --> 02:29:41.820
that and like, God, now that we know, I guess as we could boycott it,

02:29:42.220 --> 02:29:44.980
I'm just going to boycott it out of laziness just because I'm probably

02:29:44.980 --> 02:29:49.660
not going to get around to it ever. But, um, I don't know. It's just

02:29:49.660 --> 02:29:54.740
like, I just, it's too much for me to focus on. Why can't I just play

02:29:54.740 --> 02:29:55.100
games?

02:29:55.180 --> 02:29:59.100
Well, here's the thing, like, you know what, if you want to make an

02:29:59.100 --> 02:30:01.700
informed decision and that's, you know, especially as I was seeing all

02:30:01.700 --> 02:30:04.260
this, and then I'm telling you my honest reaction to this when I'm

02:30:04.260 --> 02:30:07.180
seeing YYR's email, I'm like, Hmm, I wasn't really following this game.

02:30:07.180 --> 02:30:09.820
And you know what, now I'm just not going to, you know, I've got a

02:30:09.820 --> 02:30:12.980
million other games to play right now. I don't, you know, this one is

02:30:12.980 --> 02:30:16.020
just like, yeah, it's not going to be something I'm going to go seek out

02:30:16.020 --> 02:30:19.140
now. You know what I mean? That's right. And so there's nothing wrong

02:30:19.140 --> 02:30:22.140
with making an informed decision. You choose how you want to spend

02:30:22.140 --> 02:30:22.780
your money.

02:30:22.780 --> 02:30:25.580
Besides, there's the other one that was, uh, it's not hat in time.

02:30:25.580 --> 02:30:30.500
There's one that's, uh, freeze me. That's also another like 3d

02:30:30.500 --> 02:30:34.580
platform again. That's pretty good. Okay. So we'll pick a freeze me

02:30:34.580 --> 02:30:35.100
instead.

02:30:35.140 --> 02:30:40.660
Yeah. All right. Anyhow. Uh, moving on. It just sucks that we, I live

02:30:40.660 --> 02:30:43.500
in this constant fear of like, what I just said is going to get me

02:30:43.500 --> 02:30:46.460
canceled. You know what I mean? Like, that's just the, like the

02:30:46.460 --> 02:30:46.940
society.

02:30:47.100 --> 02:30:51.260
Let's check with the higher ups on the board. Nope, we got no board.

02:30:51.300 --> 02:30:56.180
What happened to just, what happened to just educating? What happened to

02:30:56.180 --> 02:30:56.900
learning?

02:30:57.500 --> 02:31:00.540
Well, didn't you know this current administration things learning is

02:31:00.540 --> 02:31:06.300
bad. Science facts bad. Anyway, I'm not, I know I do. I just want to

02:31:06.300 --> 02:31:09.900
make it very clear. I totally respect the email and I do. I appreciate

02:31:09.900 --> 02:31:13.260
the informed decision because like I said, now I know, Oh, this is a

02:31:13.260 --> 02:31:16.020
game. Just, it wasn't even on my radar and now it's just not going to,

02:31:16.100 --> 02:31:21.140
there's so many games. Yeah, exactly. All right. Anyhow, moving on to a,

02:31:21.140 --> 02:31:26.020
there was a second update from YYR that came in on September 9th

02:31:26.020 --> 02:31:29.860
Dreamcast day that says, hello, LR. I know you probably just got done

02:31:29.860 --> 02:31:33.020
with an email from me. Fooled you. We didn't have a show, but I'm

02:31:33.020 --> 02:31:35.260
listening to the latest episode of the airport. I just want to clarify

02:31:35.260 --> 02:31:39.420
something. Xbox game pass is not a streaming service. You download an

02:31:39.420 --> 02:31:43.700
entire game to your Xbox one after which you can play it. That is the

02:31:43.700 --> 02:31:47.460
only way game pass works. Streaming is not an available option. And at

02:31:47.460 --> 02:31:50.500
the present time, Microsoft does not offer game streaming service for

02:31:50.500 --> 02:31:54.180
the Xbox one. Good. Cause it sucks. I'm glad that they don't have

02:31:54.180 --> 02:31:58.180
streaming. It should all be download. I'm down with that. I'm download

02:31:58.180 --> 02:32:01.780
with that. The only Xbox streaming that currently exists is the ability

02:32:01.780 --> 02:32:05.460
to stream from your Xbox one to your PC, but that's something entirely

02:32:05.460 --> 02:32:07.940
different. Anyway, that's it. And I hope you guys have a great week.

02:32:08.740 --> 02:32:11.460
Why am I saying fuck that stupid PlayStation now? I swear to God, I

02:32:11.460 --> 02:32:15.620
hate that shit. If you can download games, which by the way is a rumor,

02:32:15.620 --> 02:32:20.500
apparently that they are going to have downloadable games on the

02:32:20.500 --> 02:32:24.180
PlayStation. Now, apparently it came up on one of the things that likes

02:32:24.180 --> 02:32:28.900
to download this title. So that's something interesting, but I don't

02:32:28.900 --> 02:32:33.620
know. Um, yeah, I don't know if that's going to actually become a thing

02:32:33.620 --> 02:32:38.020
pretty soon. Okay. Uh, I, Y Y R is in chat and correctly stated. I

02:32:38.020 --> 02:32:40.980
forgot to finish the last email cause we got on such a tangent about

02:32:40.980 --> 02:32:43.780
cancel coach culture and all that. I forgot to finish his first email.

02:32:43.780 --> 02:32:46.740
So let me finish the first email that said moving on to something else

02:32:46.740 --> 02:32:50.100
in mid August, in response to the rumor that new super Mario, you was

02:32:50.100 --> 02:32:55.620
on its way to switch, which it is spoiler alert. It is, uh, you guys

02:32:55.620 --> 02:32:58.660
wondered why it couldn't have been super Mario maker instead spoiler

02:32:58.660 --> 02:33:01.540
alert. It wasn't all right. All right. I'm done with that. Uh, I believe

02:33:01.540 --> 02:33:04.740
that the answer to this is simple. New super Mario. You simply has to

02:33:04.740 --> 02:33:08.100
come first. It's the same reason why Konami would never release a version

02:33:08.100 --> 02:33:11.860
of DDR that lets you add your own songs. Because if they did, what

02:33:11.860 --> 02:33:15.540
would be the point of releasing another version in the same way, if you

02:33:15.540 --> 02:33:18.660
can create or download the levels of super Mario maker, why would you

02:33:18.660 --> 02:33:24.340
buy new super Mario? You, uh, P chat. Should I said spoiler? Oh, I

02:33:24.340 --> 02:33:28.100
forget. Uh, I personally trust the rumor that super Mario maker marks

02:33:28.100 --> 02:33:31.220
the end of the 2d series for now. So to me, it makes sense to release

02:33:31.220 --> 02:33:35.380
the final proper game before its creation tool, as opposed to after

02:33:35.380 --> 02:33:39.460
it. Finally, I wanted to express my gratitude. I heard every mention

02:33:39.460 --> 02:33:42.260
of super multitasking you made, Rob, and I really appreciate the

02:33:42.260 --> 02:33:45.780
plugs. Every single one. I have so much gratitude for the fact that

02:33:45.780 --> 02:33:48.420
you're enthusiastically recommending my work at every possible

02:33:48.420 --> 02:33:52.900
opportunity and allow me to do so again. That was my words, not his in

02:33:52.900 --> 02:33:56.100
the email. Allow me to do so again, super multitasking on steam. Uh, so

02:33:56.100 --> 02:33:59.060
for that, thank you very much. You're welcome very much. But one last

02:33:59.060 --> 02:34:04.820
thing is in no way whatsoever. Super Mario 64 overrated fight me.

02:34:04.820 --> 02:34:08.180
Please don't actually fight me. Why we are and everybody with that

02:34:08.180 --> 02:34:11.460
comment, super multitasking is canceled. No, I'm just kidding. Of

02:34:11.460 --> 02:34:14.580
course. I'm kidding. Of course. I'm getting everyone's welcome to

02:34:14.580 --> 02:34:18.420
their own opinion. All right. There we go. That's it for emails tonight.

02:34:18.420 --> 02:34:21.140
Thank you so much to all our emails. If you want to send us an email for

02:34:21.140 --> 02:34:24.900
a future week, participate at orange lounge, radio.com. But in the

02:34:24.900 --> 02:34:29.860
meanwhile, we have some more stories to get into, right? Loki. Yes.

02:34:29.860 --> 02:34:35.780
Let's let's talk about some stories, including this ridiculous video

02:34:35.780 --> 02:34:41.460
coming from Microsoft talking about the Xbox one limited edition

02:34:41.460 --> 02:34:46.180
grease poof controller that has to do with, of course, pub G because,

02:34:46.180 --> 02:34:50.980
you know, winner, winner, chicken dinner. Apparently it is covered

02:34:50.980 --> 02:34:55.620
with a impervious degrees urethane coating, and it's going to be a

02:34:55.620 --> 02:34:59.780
limited run. These gray and yellow controllers that are going to be

02:34:59.780 --> 02:35:05.460
available. Apparently the I don't know if this was for a certain

02:35:05.460 --> 02:35:07.780
region. It looks like it had something to do with the Australia,

02:35:07.780 --> 02:35:12.180
New Zealand. It was announced on the Xbox and the Australia,

02:35:12.180 --> 02:35:15.140
New Zealand Facebook page. And they were having some, I think,

02:35:15.140 --> 02:35:21.700
contests in regards to the launch of the game. They're basically

02:35:21.700 --> 02:35:26.020
saying, I guess you have to submit an anecdote about how Greece has

02:35:26.020 --> 02:35:30.340
ruined your gaming experience or something like that. So neat.

02:35:30.340 --> 02:35:32.900
I think those controllers, they should just cover all of the

02:35:32.900 --> 02:35:38.580
controllers with that so that Greece doesn't because gamer hands and

02:35:38.580 --> 02:35:42.340
not necessarily gamer hands, but kid hands. Holy fuck. Are they like

02:35:42.340 --> 02:35:47.380
just nasty shit? I mean, like I my switch right now is fucking

02:35:47.380 --> 02:35:51.380
disgusting. I cleaned off every now and then, but like, I don't know

02:35:51.380 --> 02:35:53.540
what the fuck that they do those things. They touch it with their

02:35:53.540 --> 02:35:57.460
like dirty ass hands. I know what they do. They eat, they eat food and

02:35:57.460 --> 02:36:01.220
play games at the same time and don't wash their hands in between.

02:36:02.020 --> 02:36:05.380
And it's a big no no. And that's how you spread disease. Like what

02:36:05.380 --> 02:36:08.180
we were talking about earlier in the show. Well, yeah, kids are dirty.

02:36:08.180 --> 02:36:10.820
I mean, of course, a disease like that's going to spread everywhere.

02:36:10.820 --> 02:36:16.660
They, you know, I don't know. All right. Well, something you can play

02:36:16.660 --> 02:36:20.340
with your grubby hands on these controllers. Actually, no, because

02:36:20.340 --> 02:36:23.860
this is on the Nintendo Switch, but is the Sega ages classic. That's

02:36:23.860 --> 02:36:28.020
right. Sonic is continuing the Sega ages series. They were announced

02:36:28.020 --> 02:36:31.700
in Famitsu magazine in Japan this week. Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Space

02:36:31.700 --> 02:36:36.340
Harrier, Columns 2, Outrun, and Thunder Force AC going to be made

02:36:36.340 --> 02:36:39.540
available in the Sega ages collection. Columns 2, you're going to be

02:36:39.540 --> 02:36:43.700
able to do online battle. Cool. Outrun will have an arranged soundtrack

02:36:43.700 --> 02:36:46.420
as well as the original music. So don't worry if you're a fan of the

02:36:46.420 --> 02:36:50.180
original. That is not going anywhere. You get both. No prices, no

02:36:50.180 --> 02:36:53.780
confirmation. These are even coming to America. I don't see why they

02:36:53.780 --> 02:36:57.540
wouldn't. And the Switch is region free after all. But as of now, this

02:36:57.540 --> 02:37:01.220
is only confirmed for Japan. I don't think the direct change to any of

02:37:01.220 --> 02:37:04.180
that or any of the subsequent news that I've seen. So anyway, that's

02:37:04.180 --> 02:37:08.180
what's going on with Sega ages. However, I should also point out they

02:37:08.180 --> 02:37:13.620
are actually asking fans their most wanted Sega ages game. So they're

02:37:13.620 --> 02:37:18.340
doing a Twitter survey asking Japanese fans what their most requested

02:37:18.340 --> 02:37:22.500
Sega age game would be. The winner will be announced at Tokyo Game

02:37:22.500 --> 02:37:26.500
Show. And there is a Sega ages stage event on the 22nd of September. So

02:37:26.500 --> 02:37:31.220
we're letting the internet vote on what should, yes, nothing bad ever

02:37:31.220 --> 02:37:36.820
happened with this. Can we vote for Phantasy Star Online 2 Western

02:37:36.820 --> 02:37:40.660
release? Can I write in that vote? Oh wait, that wouldn't work for Sega

02:37:40.660 --> 02:37:46.260
ages. Although, wouldn't like a Phantasy Star offline be a pretty cool

02:37:46.260 --> 02:37:49.460
thing? I guess that really wouldn't work. I'm just making shit up at this

02:37:49.460 --> 02:37:54.900
point. But yeah. Yeah, sg100matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:37:55.940 --> 02:37:58.820
Never let the internet vote. Nothing good will come from it. Yeah, that's

02:37:58.820 --> 02:38:01.540
kind of where I was going with this. To which Bobby Blackwell follows up

02:38:01.540 --> 02:38:08.420
with Phantasy Star Online, McPhantasy Star Online face. Yes, that.

02:38:08.420 --> 02:38:12.100
Of course the vote. I mean, I understand Sega ages were like classic

02:38:12.100 --> 02:38:16.660
arcade games, but most of the arcade games are classics now. Yeah. So

02:38:16.660 --> 02:38:24.180
clearly the vote has to be for Daytona. It has to be Daytona.

02:38:24.180 --> 02:38:29.940
Uh, can I vote for Samba de Amigo with the, with the joy con controllers

02:38:29.940 --> 02:38:35.940
as the Sambas? That could work. Right. Uh, anyway, uh, some other folks

02:38:36.020 --> 02:38:41.060
in chatter saying Gunstar Heroes. Yawn. You already got Gunstar Heroes

02:38:41.060 --> 02:38:45.860
on virtual console enough. You know why? And it's been released on other

02:38:45.860 --> 02:38:49.700
platforms. It's time for more Daytona. So what if it's like one of the

02:38:49.700 --> 02:38:56.100
greatest Genesis games always over? Get that later. It's Daytona. Samba de

02:38:56.100 --> 02:39:02.340
Amigo, Daytona. Both at the same time. Let's move on. Loki. Fighters, mega

02:39:02.420 --> 02:39:06.180
mix with all the, like, you know, we'll get all of the characters in

02:39:06.180 --> 02:39:12.900
there and brawl it. Yeah. Anyways. Um, so Epic has dropped video

02:39:12.900 --> 02:39:17.780
capture off of the switch version of Fortnite because of performance

02:39:17.780 --> 02:39:21.220
issues. First off, I was surprised that there was even video capture at

02:39:21.220 --> 02:39:25.380
all on Fortnite on the switch, but apparently it was a thing at one

02:39:25.380 --> 02:39:29.140
time, but apparently it's been affecting the guest gameplay. And so

02:39:29.140 --> 02:39:32.980
because of that, they have patched it out and says, you may have noticed

02:39:32.980 --> 02:39:37.060
we've disabled video capture feature on Nintendo switch as of version

02:39:37.060 --> 02:39:43.300
5.4 0.2, a client update. This was done for performance and stability

02:39:43.300 --> 02:39:47.540
reasons. As we've been seeing a high rate of out of memory related

02:39:47.540 --> 02:39:52.340
crashes disabling this feature saves a significant amount of Ram while

02:39:52.340 --> 02:39:55.060
also having the positive effect on the overall performance across the

02:39:55.060 --> 02:39:58.180
board. Yeah, I think that's fine. Maybe this is why Nintendo didn't

02:39:58.180 --> 02:40:01.860
want to talk about Fortnite at their direct. Who knows? I'm teasing a

02:40:01.860 --> 02:40:06.100
little bit. The fact that they had video capture in there and voice

02:40:06.100 --> 02:40:10.180
chat is pretty fucking impressive considering that hello Nintendo.

02:40:10.180 --> 02:40:14.340
Why does Splatoon not have voice chat built in without using a fucking

02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:18.740
app? Maybe now we know it's, it's got to have some power and you know,

02:40:18.740 --> 02:40:23.140
you're just using too much power to actually come on. Splatoon is not

02:40:23.140 --> 02:40:26.260
that much more of a graphically intensive game than Fortnite, please.

02:40:26.580 --> 02:40:30.180
All right. Uh, Bobby Black Wolf does point out, well, the video capture

02:40:30.180 --> 02:40:33.700
was using the switches native video capture feature, but you know, isn't

02:40:33.700 --> 02:40:36.820
that still a certain amount of Ram in the background that's being taken

02:40:36.820 --> 02:40:41.220
up? Oh, interesting. All right. Anyhow, uh, let's move on to another

02:40:41.220 --> 02:40:44.420
story. This was actually, uh, suggested in our discord. So if you're

02:40:44.420 --> 02:40:47.780
not on our discord server, you should join vog network.com slash

02:40:47.780 --> 02:40:50.900
discord. We'll get you an invite. And there's an orange lounge radio

02:40:50.900 --> 02:40:56.020
channel where this story was passed on about a potential unannounced

02:40:56.100 --> 02:41:00.580
project from Blizzard. So this is kind of rumor-y, but there is some

02:41:00.580 --> 02:41:04.020
proof. There are some receipts behind this rumor. Uh, and it's from

02:41:04.020 --> 02:41:08.500
looking at the Blizzard job site, Blizzard careers. Uh, we know a lot

02:41:08.500 --> 02:41:11.220
of Diablo stuff is in the works right now. Gee, I wonder what could

02:41:11.220 --> 02:41:13.860
be going on. Maybe we'll find out at Blizzcon. It's either an

02:41:13.860 --> 02:41:17.460
expansion or, or the number four might be seen. Who knows? Who knows?

02:41:17.460 --> 02:41:22.180
But anyway, Blizzard also has an unannounced project for people that

02:41:22.180 --> 02:41:27.220
want to build an action packed game with a beautiful visceral core

02:41:27.220 --> 02:41:31.380
combat experience. Uh, the person applying should have a passion for

02:41:31.380 --> 02:41:36.740
co-op games, RPGs, and board games. Uh, they're hiring things like art

02:41:36.740 --> 02:41:38.980
director, character, artists, environment, armist, gameplay

02:41:38.980 --> 02:41:43.460
engineer, and a lead senior level designer position where you can

02:41:43.460 --> 02:41:46.820
actually get some bullet points as to what they're doing, including

02:41:47.860 --> 02:41:51.140
own level design and world building from conception to the final stages

02:41:51.140 --> 02:41:54.740
of polish facilitating communication and coordinating team members to

02:41:54.740 --> 02:41:58.420
ensure the vision is clearly defined and understood. Um, let's see, I'm

02:41:58.420 --> 02:42:02.660
not trying not to read like all of these, but, uh, let's see partnered

02:42:02.660 --> 02:42:05.380
with engineering to define and create tooling that effectively

02:42:05.380 --> 02:42:10.180
compliments Blizzard's world class handcrafted level design. Uh, so

02:42:10.180 --> 02:42:14.180
anyway, uh, some other things that I guess are in the job listings that

02:42:14.180 --> 02:42:19.300
are interesting next gen AI, like motion capture systems, a robust

02:42:19.300 --> 02:42:24.100
first person engine for the game and a unique visual direction. So what

02:42:24.100 --> 02:42:28.980
could this be? Some people speculating it could be a Blizzard's

02:42:28.980 --> 02:42:34.740
answer to, and here's what Blizzard does very well. They take popular

02:42:34.740 --> 02:42:39.060
game genres and make them stupid easily accessible. They've done it

02:42:39.060 --> 02:42:42.420
with trading card games, Hearthstone. They've done it with EverQuest,

02:42:42.420 --> 02:42:45.620
World of Warcraft. They've done it with, you know, they've done it with

02:42:45.700 --> 02:42:50.260
other stuff. So what do you think Blizzard might be tackling now? And

02:42:50.260 --> 02:42:56.020
some people say it is no, not battle royale. This could be Blizzard's

02:42:56.020 --> 02:43:00.180
battle royale project. What do you think? Stop jumping on that train.

02:43:00.180 --> 02:43:04.100
It's I think it's already gone. You know, what's interesting. Be an

02:43:04.100 --> 02:43:08.660
innovator, not like a copier. I remember, I don't know how I remember

02:43:08.660 --> 02:43:14.900
this, but I remember on a hoard house a long time ago, there was rumors

02:43:14.900 --> 02:43:18.740
that Titan, which as we know became Overwatch, essentially Titan was

02:43:18.740 --> 02:43:22.340
canceled. And from the grave of the assets and things like that, that's

02:43:22.340 --> 02:43:26.100
where Overwatch came from. I think Overwatch, the battling was supposed

02:43:26.100 --> 02:43:30.980
to be like once part of the Titan game. But anyway, my point is I

02:43:30.980 --> 02:43:34.340
remember one of the early rumors about Titan. What is that was that it

02:43:34.340 --> 02:43:38.740
was a James Bond-esque spy game. It was a spy versus spy type of game as

02:43:38.740 --> 02:43:45.300
Nespionage spy type of game. I mean, Team Fortress 2? I don't know.

02:43:45.300 --> 02:43:49.780
Could this be like a James Bond-y spy type of game? I think that'd be

02:43:49.780 --> 02:43:52.500
because, you know, when I hear like first person, I think, well, they

02:43:52.500 --> 02:43:55.620
kind of already have that with Overwatch. This is going to have to be

02:43:55.620 --> 02:43:59.460
different than Overwatch. So either it's, you know, battle royale-esque

02:43:59.460 --> 02:44:01.780
or it's, you know, something, you know, simply something we haven't seen yet.

02:44:01.780 --> 02:44:08.340
Overwatch 2. It feels early for that. Overwatch, it still feels early to

02:44:08.340 --> 02:44:12.660
say Overwatch 2 because, I mean, I still think if they're going to do

02:44:12.660 --> 02:44:16.740
Overwatch expansions, it's going to be single player because like,

02:44:16.740 --> 02:44:19.380
they're still pumping heroes out there. They've still got, still got

02:44:19.380 --> 02:44:22.740
Overwatch League is a big thing. And you know, that's all kind of built

02:44:22.740 --> 02:44:25.780
into the base Overwatch game. So I'm not sure Blizzard suddenly wants

02:44:25.780 --> 02:44:29.060
to put out Overwatch 2 and disrupt all of that. That doesn't make sense.

02:44:29.060 --> 02:44:33.860
I feel like this really is some type of new type of project. So I don't

02:44:33.860 --> 02:44:39.140
know. Kaijuto says in chat, Overwatch isn't a spy game at all. I know.

02:44:39.140 --> 02:44:41.220
That's my point. Maybe this is.

02:44:44.020 --> 02:44:46.980
ActDeft in chat says, please give us a fucking single player campaign,

02:44:46.980 --> 02:44:49.700
Blizzard. Could be. I mean, that might be why you would need to design

02:44:49.700 --> 02:44:53.220
levels and so forth. Maybe Overwatch is going to go with a single player

02:44:53.220 --> 02:44:58.500
expansion. Who knows? I don't know. Anyway, we'll find out maybe at

02:44:58.500 --> 02:45:01.540
BlizzCon or we might have to wait another year because Blizzard is very

02:45:01.540 --> 02:45:04.660
good at keeping things in the oven until they are very, very, very done.

02:45:05.380 --> 02:45:09.140
Kaijuto in chat does say though, I want a battle royale espionage game.

02:45:09.140 --> 02:45:13.220
I think, yeah, I kind of think it's tie the spy versus spy, James Bond,

02:45:13.220 --> 02:45:17.700
GoldenEye 64, but with battle royale. I think, I don't know. That might be

02:45:17.700 --> 02:45:22.740
kind of rad. We'll see. Everyone's wanting Agent, which is that game

02:45:22.740 --> 02:45:27.620
that was supposed to be. Oh yeah. Rockstar stuff. Oh yeah. I remember

02:45:27.620 --> 02:45:30.180
that. I remember that. All right. Anyway, a few more stories for you

02:45:30.260 --> 02:45:33.380
guys. Then we're going to get to the Skype line for a little bit tonight.

02:45:33.380 --> 02:45:36.180
If you do want to call in though, I encourage you to get in relatively

02:45:36.180 --> 02:45:39.300
quick because, um, I'm not going to keep it open all night cause the

02:45:39.300 --> 02:45:42.020
show's already running a little long. So, but we got some stories to get

02:45:42.020 --> 02:45:46.260
to before we get there. So first Loki. All right. Let's talk about

02:45:46.260 --> 02:45:51.860
uncensored sex. Yes. A hundred percent uncensored sex games.

02:45:52.980 --> 02:45:59.060
Loki, I like you, but I don't like you. So, um, you know, you may remember

02:45:59.060 --> 02:46:02.580
there was a whole like controversy with steam and pulling down games

02:46:02.580 --> 02:46:05.940
off of their service that were like these visual novels and stuff. And

02:46:05.940 --> 02:46:08.420
then they were like, no, no, no, we're not trying to ban anything like

02:46:08.420 --> 02:46:11.620
that. We just don't want people to see anime titty. So now apparently

02:46:11.620 --> 02:46:15.540
they are, they have approved the first a hundred percent, um, uncensored

02:46:15.540 --> 02:46:24.260
game called negligee. And, um, and it is out now, uh, for people to

02:46:24.260 --> 02:46:31.620
check out, but there is one small problem. Apparently the, um, you know,

02:46:31.620 --> 02:46:35.940
the content, some in some countries it would be considered possibly

02:46:35.940 --> 02:46:41.780
illegal. So they have to ban it from certain, um, regions. So for

02:46:41.780 --> 02:46:47.540
example, Belgium, Japan, Malaysia, Botswana, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria,

02:46:47.540 --> 02:46:53.380
South Africa, Sudan, Uganda, Bangladesh, China, Lebanon, South Korea,

02:46:53.380 --> 02:46:59.220
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, um, Belarus, Iceland, Ukraine,

02:46:59.220 --> 02:47:05.220
Russia, Australia, Australia, man, uh, Papua New Guinea, um, Guyana,

02:47:05.780 --> 02:47:10.980
Iraq, Dubai, UAE, and Germany are not going to be able to check out this

02:47:10.980 --> 02:47:17.700
game. And that's made people sad. Well, I mean, they can always pirate

02:47:17.700 --> 02:47:20.980
it. No, I'm just, I'm not going to endorse that, but I just feel like

02:47:21.060 --> 02:47:24.100
that's what's going to happen when you ban something that people will

02:47:24.100 --> 02:47:29.220
find a way to get their anime titty. They will. So I'm just being a

02:47:29.220 --> 02:47:33.220
realist here. People just be, are you interested in a 100% uncensored

02:47:33.220 --> 02:47:36.020
sex games on steam? Are you, are you gonna buy negligee? I don't like

02:47:36.020 --> 02:47:39.700
visual novel games. So probably not, probably not, not enough action

02:47:39.700 --> 02:47:43.380
for you. All right. Well, maybe this will be more up your alley.

02:47:44.340 --> 02:47:50.340
Uh, they are making a game out of the novel series. Goosebumps. You know

02:47:50.340 --> 02:47:56.980
what? You know what the Goosebumps books are, right? I think those have

02:47:56.980 --> 02:48:00.820
been around since like we were in high school and that age. Uh, but

02:48:00.820 --> 02:48:05.380
anyway, Goosebumps the game is on its way on the Nintendo switch. It's

02:48:05.380 --> 02:48:10.020
going to be launching on October 9th from way forward. And that's a way

02:48:10.020 --> 02:48:13.220
forward has been putting out some quality shit. So, uh, this actually

02:48:13.220 --> 02:48:17.540
might be pretty rad. Uh, this action game was originally released in 2015

02:48:17.540 --> 02:48:21.620
as a prequel to the Goosebumps film. Uh, in the game, you are in the

02:48:21.620 --> 02:48:23.940
car- you're in the shoes of a character whose neighborhood has been

02:48:23.940 --> 02:48:28.580
overrun by R.L. Stine's monsters from the Goosebumps series. You have

02:48:28.580 --> 02:48:32.660
to outsmart and use your wits to investigate, uh, the clues and the

02:48:32.660 --> 02:48:37.300
surroundings and figure it all out before it's too late and you get

02:48:37.300 --> 02:48:40.580
eaten by a grew. Oh, wait, that was his org game. But anyway, that is,

02:48:40.580 --> 02:48:45.060
uh, all on its way. So, um, check that out on Nintendo switch, October

02:48:45.060 --> 02:48:51.060
9th. Anyhow, let's get to the calls. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word

02:48:51.060 --> 02:48:54.420
on Skype. If you want to give us a call and talk about, uh, anything

02:48:54.420 --> 02:48:57.940
maybe we have or have not gotten to yet on the program tonight,

02:48:57.940 --> 02:49:00.820
especially since we've been gone for a little bit, maybe you have

02:49:00.820 --> 02:49:03.860
something you wanted to ask us that we missed from the past couple

02:49:03.860 --> 02:49:06.580
weeks. Uh, do we have any, uh, other last minute stories?

02:49:06.580 --> 02:49:10.580
Yes, this is coming from Twitter from Stanley Tucci Mane. And this is

02:49:10.580 --> 02:49:15.060
basically talking about a Silent Hill Enhanced Edition that fans have

02:49:15.060 --> 02:49:19.860
made, because if you may remember, the Silent Hill HD collection sucked.

02:49:20.500 --> 02:49:25.460
So the Silent Hill 2 Enhanced Edition is basically a bunch of

02:49:25.460 --> 02:49:30.020
modifications to the PC version of the game that fixed a lot of the

02:49:30.020 --> 02:49:33.700
issues. It adds widescreen support, a higher resolution display,

02:49:34.500 --> 02:49:38.980
removal of audio bugs, PlayStation 2 quality audio and fog, better

02:49:38.980 --> 02:49:43.940
controller support, and lots more. So you can go check it out.

02:49:44.500 --> 02:49:47.940
That's pretty cool. Um, again, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype. I saw a

02:49:47.940 --> 02:49:50.580
call come in and I just missed it because I was, um, looking at

02:49:50.580 --> 02:49:53.220
Loki when he was talking about this. If you were, um, looking forward

02:49:53.220 --> 02:50:00.260
to that mod, that's enhanced.townofsilenthill.com slash SH2. So go

02:50:00.260 --> 02:50:04.260
check it out there. Okay. Uh, we have a call coming in. Let's get to it.

02:50:04.260 --> 02:50:07.780
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Hello, it's YYR.

02:50:07.780 --> 02:50:09.380
Haven't we heard enough from you already?

02:50:10.180 --> 02:50:12.260
No, I have more grievances. Sorry.

02:50:12.260 --> 02:50:14.260
Fine. Uh, what else shall we hear about?

02:50:15.940 --> 02:50:18.020
Okay. Well, let me begin the airing then.

02:50:18.020 --> 02:50:18.660
All right.

02:50:18.660 --> 02:50:23.860
Wait, hold on. There's a lot. No, no, just kidding. Um, actually I'm

02:50:23.860 --> 02:50:29.860
going to refer to something that you said during your call with Bobby

02:50:29.860 --> 02:50:36.180
on his show last week. Um, and that was when you mentioned Beat Saber

02:50:36.180 --> 02:50:40.260
and you were talking about, um, how, you know, people have just

02:50:40.260 --> 02:50:44.820
put in these stupid hard charts and things like that. Um, you

02:50:44.820 --> 02:50:48.180
mentioned that, uh, that's also kind of part of the reason that

02:50:48.180 --> 02:50:52.260
you're turned off by new DDR, uh, because there's been such an

02:50:52.260 --> 02:50:55.700
emphasis on these high level charts and that's just really not your

02:50:55.700 --> 02:51:01.060
scene. Right. And, uh, well, I'm just going to mention, I mean, the,

02:51:01.700 --> 02:51:05.380
as it is, yes, they are adding a few new hard things to the game

02:51:05.380 --> 02:51:10.580
here and there, but despite that, the majority of new charts being

02:51:10.580 --> 02:51:15.060
added to the game are still in the 13 and below range, which is like

02:51:15.060 --> 02:51:22.260
easy nines, uh, on the old, uh, scale. So there is still a lot of.

02:51:22.260 --> 02:51:26.100
Maybe these scale updates have got me all thrown off because you say

02:51:26.100 --> 02:51:31.540
13 and I go, that's very, I can only do a nine. What do you mean a 13

02:51:31.540 --> 02:51:32.740
is an easy song?

02:51:33.540 --> 02:51:36.580
No, on the new scale max 300 is a 15.

02:51:36.580 --> 02:51:41.140
Oh, wow. Okay. All right. Well, and that's, let's be max 300 was like

02:51:41.140 --> 02:51:45.620
the original ridiculous song. Look, I'm not trying to knock the

02:51:45.620 --> 02:51:48.900
people that are into that. And I hope that's coming through, but I

02:51:48.900 --> 02:51:51.860
hope people kind of understand that it's like when you're a dirty

02:51:51.860 --> 02:51:55.620
casual like me, which is an okay thing to be, you could be a fan of

02:51:55.620 --> 02:52:00.420
DDR and not like, you know, have the stamina to crank out these

02:52:00.740 --> 02:52:04.900
level 15 songs and all this stuff. I've been playing every single

02:52:04.900 --> 02:52:09.540
day, almost every single day for at least 30 to 60 minutes a day.

02:52:09.540 --> 02:52:11.620
And I still don't have the stamina to do, but then again, I play

02:52:11.620 --> 02:52:12.120
doubles. So.

02:52:12.980 --> 02:52:17.540
Wow. You should do max 300 on doubles. Yeah, exactly. Stupid

02:52:17.540 --> 02:52:20.020
noob. That's cause I don't use the bar.

02:52:21.940 --> 02:52:27.940
Okay. So I'll mention this with regard to that. Um, I do, uh, play

02:52:27.940 --> 02:52:32.740
double. So, and yeah, I play max 300 on double occasionally

02:52:32.740 --> 02:52:35.860
too. And to make up for the fact that you have to use both

02:52:35.860 --> 02:52:39.460
sides, the actual step chart is a little less dense than the

02:52:39.460 --> 02:52:43.780
single version. So, but I do hold the bar for it, you know, one

02:52:43.780 --> 02:52:47.140
hand on each bar. Oh my gosh. It's like doing the splits.

02:52:48.100 --> 02:52:54.980
Um, you do. Okay. So DDR prohibits, uh, what in the groove

02:52:54.980 --> 02:52:59.460
calls stretch jumps. That's things like, uh, the left arrow

02:52:59.460 --> 02:53:02.900
on one player side and the right arrow on two player side.

02:53:02.900 --> 02:53:07.300
Yeah. I think the, the furthest you can, the furthest DDR gives

02:53:07.300 --> 02:53:11.860
you is stuff like right on the one player side and up or down

02:53:11.860 --> 02:53:14.900
on the two player side. Like you won't even see right on both

02:53:14.900 --> 02:53:17.860
sides. It, it will not give you that. So don't worry about

02:53:17.860 --> 02:53:21.860
down, down sometimes or up, up. Yeah. I feel like I've seen him

02:53:21.860 --> 02:53:29.620
do up, up 3d is, uh, the, uh, the standard steps have down,

02:53:29.620 --> 02:53:34.660
down, I believe, or they're probably isolated jumps and not

02:53:34.660 --> 02:53:37.300
like right after other notes. Like they're not coming at you

02:53:37.300 --> 02:53:40.260
as fast as they are in other songs. Like jumps like that are

02:53:40.260 --> 02:53:42.340
okay when they're like spaced out. You know what I mean?

02:53:43.620 --> 02:53:47.060
Yeah. I don't remember seeing that in DDR, but, uh, yeah, it's

02:53:47.060 --> 02:53:50.580
a, it's uncommon. Yeah. In the groove though, they just throw

02:53:50.580 --> 02:53:53.620
all kinds of crazy stuff in there because it's in the group

02:53:53.620 --> 02:53:57.060
because in the group fans are crazy. Yeah. I'm not starting

02:53:57.060 --> 02:54:00.820
that war again. I'm just teasing. I'm teasing. But yeah,

02:54:00.820 --> 02:54:04.260
absolutely. And, and nobody in the community from the, you

02:54:04.260 --> 02:54:07.140
know, the beginners all the way up through the super world-class

02:54:07.140 --> 02:54:10.900
experts, nobody looks down on people playing easier stuff.

02:54:10.900 --> 02:54:14.100
Everyone plays what they like and, uh, it's very, uh, it's a

02:54:14.100 --> 02:54:18.660
very positive community and, uh, yeah. That's good. Stay

02:54:18.660 --> 02:54:21.220
positive. And like I mentioned before, you know, so one reason

02:54:21.220 --> 02:54:23.060
I kind of like all the easy stuff and yeah, you know, I know

02:54:23.060 --> 02:54:25.300
a lot of songs have easy stuff, but I feel like, I feel like a

02:54:25.300 --> 02:54:27.460
lot of the stuff I see online is just like all the hard stuff,

02:54:27.460 --> 02:54:29.220
but I guess that's just, you know, people want to brag about

02:54:29.220 --> 02:54:31.700
their accomplishments and all, which is cool. But I think part

02:54:31.700 --> 02:54:33.540
of the reason I like the freestyle stuff is like, oh,

02:54:33.540 --> 02:54:36.020
it's like the easy, but it has finesse. And that's kind of what

02:54:36.020 --> 02:54:38.340
I was saying, kind of the point I was trying to make with the

02:54:38.340 --> 02:54:41.220
beat, beat saber stuff was that it's like, wow, somebody's like

02:54:41.220 --> 02:54:44.420
kind of figured out a way to like grade freestyle sort of,

02:54:44.420 --> 02:54:48.180
which was something that was so, you know, opinion based

02:54:48.180 --> 02:54:51.780
before. It's like now beat saber kind of brings both those

02:54:51.780 --> 02:54:54.980
worlds together, if that makes sense. Yeah. It's kind of neat.

02:54:54.980 --> 02:54:57.380
And when, when I heard your comment about the scoring

02:54:57.380 --> 02:55:00.820
system and, uh, you know, that it takes your movements and

02:55:00.820 --> 02:55:04.420
your finesse into account, I don't know. I think I, I actually

02:55:04.420 --> 02:55:06.820
kind of liked that because it's something different. Yeah.

02:55:06.820 --> 02:55:10.500
Something different, you know, at the end of the day, how many

02:55:10.500 --> 02:55:13.860
of us are really playing for score? I mean, I'm sure, I'm

02:55:13.860 --> 02:55:15.620
sure there's a lot of hardcore music fans. There's gonna be

02:55:15.620 --> 02:55:17.460
people raising their hand here and there. They're saying me,

02:55:17.460 --> 02:55:19.300
me, but I bet there's a lot of people that are going to play

02:55:19.300 --> 02:55:22.740
beat saber just because they just want to play the beat, be

02:55:22.740 --> 02:55:26.180
in the experience. They want to ride the ride. You know what I

02:55:26.180 --> 02:55:31.300
mean? Yeah. Well, I mean, I, I played DDR for score actually.

02:55:31.300 --> 02:55:34.900
But I think, I think with DDR, even there's a lot of people

02:55:34.900 --> 02:55:37.940
that are like, oh, cool. Yeah. DDR is cool. I like that game.

02:55:37.940 --> 02:55:40.260
But they just, when they say that it's like, they, they hop

02:55:40.260 --> 02:55:42.980
on the machine occasionally and play it. And that that's really

02:55:42.980 --> 02:55:45.060
it. You know what I mean? Like, and they, there's nothing wrong

02:55:45.060 --> 02:55:48.660
with that. There's nothing wrong with that. But next time

02:55:48.660 --> 02:55:52.980
you play Ace, I definitely would encourage you to, you know,

02:55:52.980 --> 02:55:56.740
don't just go into the, you know, the extreme folder, the

02:55:56.740 --> 02:56:01.460
Max 2 folder or what have you. But keep, keep holding down that

02:56:01.460 --> 02:56:06.340
up or down button and go to the level sort feature. It's very

02:56:06.340 --> 02:56:08.820
easy to find. You don't have to press any special button

02:56:08.820 --> 02:56:12.260
combination to find it. Go to the level sort. Yeah, because I

02:56:12.260 --> 02:56:16.980
do that pop in music. Yeah. And, and go, go ahead and find,

02:56:16.980 --> 02:56:20.500
you know, and, and what's really neat about DDR Ace is let's say

02:56:20.500 --> 02:56:24.340
you go to level sort 10. So it shows you all the tens, but it

02:56:24.340 --> 02:56:27.620
doesn't just show you the expert tens or the difficult tens. It

02:56:27.620 --> 02:56:31.380
shows you all the tens across all the difficulties. Yeah. No,

02:56:31.380 --> 02:56:33.860
I like that. BeatMania 2DX does that too, which I really like.

02:56:35.060 --> 02:56:37.860
So, but yeah, and you'll find a lot of new songs that way and

02:56:37.860 --> 02:56:39.940
you'll get to play at your level and everything is good,

02:56:39.940 --> 02:56:43.220
except for when they give a chart the wrong difficulty,

02:56:43.220 --> 02:56:46.260
which unfortunately happens a lot, but whatever. Honestly,

02:56:46.260 --> 02:56:49.220
why are though the real answer is instead of going straight to

02:56:49.220 --> 02:56:51.380
the difficulty store, what I usually do is I go straight to

02:56:51.380 --> 02:56:56.420
Ariana Grande. Can't help it. Can't help it. That song is a

02:56:56.420 --> 02:57:00.180
banger. It is. Even if it's like, even if there's like, I

02:57:00.180 --> 02:57:02.740
would much prefer if Into You was the song that was in DDR,

02:57:02.740 --> 02:57:04.420
but that's okay. You know what? We can't, we can't own them

02:57:04.420 --> 02:57:08.980
all. All right. It's funny. I actually found an ITG chart for

02:57:08.980 --> 02:57:13.300
that and it's a remix of the song that's just amazing, but

02:57:13.300 --> 02:57:19.060
the chart is really tricky. So it's like, Oh man. But before I

02:57:19.060 --> 02:57:21.380
go, I just want to address something I saw in chat from

02:57:21.380 --> 02:57:25.300
Dark Tetsuya. You know, DDR is 20 years old this month. And

02:57:25.300 --> 02:57:29.620
what's really interesting is that they did not update DDR

02:57:29.620 --> 02:57:34.660
Ace for like a period of five to six months. And then a few

02:57:34.660 --> 02:57:37.780
months ago, they started just throwing all these new songs

02:57:37.780 --> 02:57:41.060
into the game. And finally, they just dropped a massive

02:57:41.060 --> 02:57:44.340
update like a few weeks ago. And a lot of us in the community

02:57:44.340 --> 02:57:47.860
are starting to think that this is ramping up to a new game

02:57:47.860 --> 02:57:51.140
announcement like any day now. Ooh, that would be fun.

02:57:52.340 --> 02:57:56.260
Especially to commemorate the anniversary. Yeah, exactly. And

02:57:56.260 --> 02:57:59.300
so, you know, and because, you know, earlier in the year, they

02:57:59.300 --> 02:58:01.940
launched Dance Rush Stardom, which hopefully you've had the

02:58:01.940 --> 02:58:03.780
chance to play because it's really fun. No, we should bring

02:58:03.780 --> 02:58:06.420
that to Dave and Buster's because... No, I haven't played

02:58:07.060 --> 02:58:09.860
over here. I've been since... I almost went to round... Okay,

02:58:09.860 --> 02:58:13.140
here's... You're gonna laugh YYR. So I almost went to round

02:58:13.140 --> 02:58:15.380
one over the weekend because I was hanging out with my buddy

02:58:15.380 --> 02:58:18.660
JD and we were talking. He's as into the music games as you

02:58:18.660 --> 02:58:22.020
are. So... Yeah, I know. I played DDR with him when I was in

02:58:22.020 --> 02:58:25.860
San Fran a while back. We were talking about going to round

02:58:25.860 --> 02:58:29.380
one because he doesn't really have a car. So, you know, it's

02:58:29.380 --> 02:58:31.540
hard, a little harder for him to get to round one. But you

02:58:31.540 --> 02:58:34.420
know what? YYR, what ended up happening? We went to Drag

02:58:34.500 --> 02:58:39.140
Queen Brunch instead. I'm sure that was definitely

02:58:39.140 --> 02:58:41.860
entertaining in its own way. It was because the drag queen

02:58:41.860 --> 02:58:47.860
performed Ariana Grande. So, I still got my fix. So, all

02:58:47.860 --> 02:58:50.340
right. Anyway, my friend Emily, go to try to get some more

02:58:50.340 --> 02:58:53.380
calls. But take care, okay? Hey, have a great week. Thanks.

02:58:53.380 --> 02:58:57.380
You too. Bye-bye. Take care. Bye. All right. Orange Lounge

02:58:57.380 --> 02:58:59.780
Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.

02:58:59.780 --> 02:59:03.220
Yeah, true story. Went to Drag Queen Brunch. They just opened

02:59:03.220 --> 02:59:05.700
a Hamburger Mary's in San Francisco which is funny

02:59:05.700 --> 02:59:07.860
because that, yeah, I think they used to have one there

02:59:07.860 --> 02:59:09.620
years ago and then it closed. Now, they have a brand new

02:59:09.620 --> 02:59:12.260
one. They do that kind of stuff there. So, you know, good

02:59:12.260 --> 02:59:18.100
times. Good times. Good way to have a really, oh, I tried to

02:59:18.100 --> 02:59:21.140
pick up that call and it immediately hung up. That's not

02:59:21.140 --> 02:59:24.900
good. Alright, we'll see if we can get one more call in here

02:59:24.900 --> 02:59:28.020
well before we close up shop for the night. Let's get to it

02:59:28.020 --> 02:59:31.380
higher on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Oh my god, Rob.

02:59:32.100 --> 02:59:35.780
Hi. How you doing, Rageinator? What's up? Good. How are you?

02:59:35.780 --> 02:59:40.260
Good. What's on your mind? Well, two, two things. They're

02:59:40.260 --> 02:59:43.780
kind of sort of related. Sorry, I really haven't been around

02:59:43.780 --> 02:59:46.500
too much for the live shows. Unfortunately, real life is

02:59:46.500 --> 02:59:48.740
kind of going in the way. That's okay. We haven't really

02:59:48.740 --> 02:59:53.220
been around either. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I usually try to make a

02:59:53.220 --> 02:59:55.860
habit of, you know, being around for live shows and all

02:59:55.860 --> 02:59:59.140
that. You know, you know, you know, it's been a kind of a

02:59:59.140 --> 03:00:05.780
habit of mine for... Me too. What, ten years plus? But

03:00:05.780 --> 03:00:12.580
anyway, you know, as it relates, you know, to that, you

03:00:12.580 --> 03:00:18.980
know, there's someone very close to me that's into gaming

03:00:18.980 --> 03:00:22.740
that just, you know, started seeing relatively recently.

03:00:22.740 --> 03:00:26.740
She's into horror games predominantly. Oh boy.

03:00:30.420 --> 03:00:33.860
Now, she, you know, she already has Dead by Daylight and

03:00:33.860 --> 03:00:37.780
Resident Evil 7, which I gifted her, and she has already

03:00:37.780 --> 03:00:43.380
played the Fear series and she plays all her games through

03:00:43.380 --> 03:00:50.980
Steam. Now, that being said, what horror games can you name

03:00:50.980 --> 03:00:55.140
off the bat, aside from the ones that are listed, would,

03:00:55.140 --> 03:00:59.620
you know, would you recommend? Rageinator, it's like the

03:00:59.620 --> 03:01:04.260
genre that I play the least because the scares are too much

03:01:04.260 --> 03:01:07.620
for me. Although, I mean, certainly, if she is not playing

03:01:07.620 --> 03:01:10.180
the Five Nights at Freddy's series, those games are

03:01:10.180 --> 03:01:13.060
insanely popular, although some people don't like the jump

03:01:13.060 --> 03:01:16.500
scares. I remember a game from a few years ago called

03:01:16.500 --> 03:01:20.660
Slender Man that people really liked to see me play on Twitch

03:01:20.660 --> 03:01:25.220
because when I would get scared the hell out of, it was

03:01:25.220 --> 03:01:29.620
always a good time. I liked the Friday the 13th game that they

03:01:29.620 --> 03:01:33.460
did, but I kind of think Dead by Daylight kind of took all

03:01:33.460 --> 03:01:36.740
those because it's a very, very similar type of game. I think

03:01:36.740 --> 03:01:39.460
it kind of already took those people away because then

03:01:39.460 --> 03:01:42.020
Friday the 13th ran into all these problems where suddenly

03:01:42.020 --> 03:01:44.340
like the movie licensing was an issue and all this stuff. So, I

03:01:44.340 --> 03:01:47.140
think that game is kind of like kind of like dropped off really

03:01:47.140 --> 03:01:49.460
fast and I think most of those people went over to Dead by

03:01:49.460 --> 03:01:51.860
Daylight, but I enjoyed the Friday the 13th game. So, if

03:01:51.860 --> 03:01:54.420
she's never played it, I would think that's one. But you know

03:01:54.420 --> 03:01:59.220
what? I'm gonna say go for the gate because these are the ones

03:01:59.220 --> 03:02:01.700
I'm more into instead of like the jump scares and things like

03:02:01.700 --> 03:02:04.100
that. Go into the things that are really like the

03:02:04.100 --> 03:02:07.780
psychological horrors. Is Silent Hill available on Steam?

03:02:07.780 --> 03:02:10.100
Because that's gonna be serious. I'm always gonna. I don't think

03:02:10.100 --> 03:02:14.260
so. I mean, if they are on Steam, I sure as hell haven't

03:02:14.260 --> 03:02:17.940
seen them. Hmm. Well, look for it and see if it's there because

03:02:17.940 --> 03:02:21.460
that would be an absolute recommend for me and then what

03:02:21.460 --> 03:02:23.540
was I also gonna say as far as like the story. Silent Hill

03:02:23.540 --> 03:02:27.780
Homecoming is. It's not the best but it's not. You could do

03:02:27.780 --> 03:02:32.260
a lot worse. We just talked about Alan Wake earlier. Is

03:02:32.260 --> 03:02:34.660
Alan Wake still available on Steam or is it? I think that was

03:02:34.660 --> 03:02:39.780
still. The original game? No. American Nightmare? Yes. Oh,

03:02:39.780 --> 03:02:41.780
that's weird. The original game is not. That's the one I would

03:02:41.780 --> 03:02:45.380
have recommended because that's more the psychological thing I

03:02:45.380 --> 03:02:48.020
would have said. Okay, so. Yeah, I think I think it has to

03:02:48.020 --> 03:02:52.340
do with music licensing but I could be wrong. Okay. So, the

03:02:52.340 --> 03:02:56.260
chat room always helping me out when I cannot help. Uh Pooba

03:02:56.260 --> 03:03:00.180
has a bunch of answers here. Amnesia. Oh, **** I forgot about

03:03:00.180 --> 03:03:03.460
the amnesia. She hasn't played Amnesia. Like, get the first

03:03:03.460 --> 03:03:05.780
one. I mean, the later ones aren't bad but the the first

03:03:05.780 --> 03:03:10.900
Amnesia game, holy **** That is that is one to do. Uh Pooba

03:03:10.900 --> 03:03:13.220
also says until dawn. That's a PlayStation game though. That's

03:03:13.220 --> 03:03:17.300
not on Steam. Trying to kind of filter this list for Steam.

03:03:17.300 --> 03:03:19.300
Evil Within, was that a PC release or is that only

03:03:19.300 --> 03:03:22.420
PlayStation? No, that would've been PC as well. Maybe Evil

03:03:22.420 --> 03:03:24.500
Within. I've heard a lot of good things about that as well.

03:03:24.500 --> 03:03:27.140
My son would recommend Bendy and the Ink Machine. That's

03:03:27.140 --> 03:03:31.140
free. The first episode is free. Uh Alien Isolation. I

03:03:31.140 --> 03:03:33.220
think that's a really good recommendation as well and I

03:03:33.220 --> 03:03:36.020
know that's on Steam and I know a lot of people are really into

03:03:36.020 --> 03:03:38.420
that. It's a different type of horror because the alien games

03:03:38.420 --> 03:03:43.060
but I hear it is it's **** scary. Oh, alright. Alright,

03:03:43.060 --> 03:03:46.980
well, definitely keeping all that in mind. Uh you know, in

03:03:46.980 --> 03:03:49.540
you know, in fact, I know it's a couple of months off. I'm

03:03:49.540 --> 03:03:52.820
trying to get a couple of ideas for her for Christmas present.

03:03:52.820 --> 03:03:56.180
So, you know, I'll definitely mark those down. Uh you know,

03:03:56.180 --> 03:03:59.540
on the relay note, you know, there I can't say for sure but

03:03:59.540 --> 03:04:04.180
there's a chance that you may have run into her while at

03:04:04.180 --> 03:04:07.140
Dragon Con. You know, I know there's there was like 80

03:04:07.140 --> 03:04:10.100
something like 80 thousand people there. Yeah. So, trying

03:04:10.100 --> 03:04:13.380
to find trying to find one person that is like trying to

03:04:13.380 --> 03:04:17.460
find uh you know a hand stick but do you remember seeing

03:04:17.460 --> 03:04:24.740
anyone in uh uh a Bioshock 2 Big Sister cosplay at all? Um

03:04:24.740 --> 03:04:29.780
not this year. I've seen that in years past. Yeah. What about

03:04:29.780 --> 03:04:34.740
um like a variation of uh the Powerpuff Girls uh you know

03:04:34.740 --> 03:04:38.820
cosplay. I do remember seeing Powerpuff Girls but I'm not

03:04:38.820 --> 03:04:42.100
gonna guarantee it was the same thing that uh yeah you know

03:04:42.100 --> 03:04:44.500
again you you're kinda right. There's 80 thousand people.

03:04:44.500 --> 03:04:46.980
Honestly, I think the best chance that I would have run

03:04:46.980 --> 03:04:49.780
into her if she was at that if she's a horror game fan, she

03:04:49.780 --> 03:04:53.380
might have been to that Five Nights at Freddy panel. Uh well

03:04:53.380 --> 03:04:58.340
uh I don't think she was uh went to any panels at least not

03:04:58.340 --> 03:05:01.540
that she mentioned. Uh she you know was more or less mingling

03:05:01.540 --> 03:05:04.660
around going to various parties and whatnot. It's fine.

03:05:04.660 --> 03:05:07.220
It's what a lot of people do. Unfortunately, I couldn't go

03:05:07.220 --> 03:05:11.780
with her, you know, cuz kevlar expenses but. Sure. But you

03:05:11.780 --> 03:05:14.660
know, she told me all about and you know, she told me she had a

03:05:14.660 --> 03:05:18.020
blast so but uh anyway, I'll let you go. I've been rambling

03:05:18.020 --> 03:05:20.660
on too long and I'm sure you wanna take some more no more

03:05:20.660 --> 03:05:23.700
calls but I'll uh speak to you soon, right? No worries. Take

03:05:23.700 --> 03:05:29.940
care and uh we'll see you soon. Yup. You too. Yup. Bye. I

03:05:29.940 --> 03:05:31.780
don't know if I would have found one particular person at

03:05:31.780 --> 03:05:35.780
Dragon Con. There's a lot of cosplays to be honest. A lot of

03:05:35.780 --> 03:05:39.700
excellent cosplay and I've seen the full on uh not the now that

03:05:39.700 --> 03:05:41.700
he's now that I'm thinking about it. I wasn't I'm getting

03:05:41.700 --> 03:05:45.140
my Bioshock terms mixed up cuz I saw the I saw the big

03:05:45.140 --> 03:05:49.460
daddies like the full on like mech **** I saw that like a

03:05:49.460 --> 03:05:52.260
couple years ago and that was like I remember thinking like

03:05:52.260 --> 03:05:55.780
that was some impressive **** cosplay like you know but they

03:05:55.780 --> 03:05:57.700
have said Dragon Con has been called the Super Bowl of

03:05:57.700 --> 03:06:00.580
cosplay and it does that for a reason because there's some

03:06:00.580 --> 03:06:04.740
really impressive stuff there but in all honesty, this year,

03:06:04.740 --> 03:06:07.860
I tried to stay away from a lot of that because they all hang

03:06:07.860 --> 03:06:14.420
out at the Marriott and it's so crowded in there and like I

03:06:14.420 --> 03:06:18.340
can do crowds to a point but like it doesn't happen to me a

03:06:18.340 --> 03:06:21.540
lot but I had a claustrophobia moment at Dragon Con this year.

03:06:21.540 --> 03:06:24.660
That has not happened to me since the very first Gamer X

03:06:24.660 --> 03:06:27.780
that was in the basement of this very small hotel and like

03:06:27.780 --> 03:06:29.700
all these panels were letting out at the same time. It got

03:06:29.700 --> 03:06:32.580
too crowded down there and my brain just went, what if this

03:06:32.580 --> 03:06:35.540
place caught on fire right now and I like started freaking out

03:06:35.540 --> 03:06:38.100
so I had a moment like that at Dragon Con this year and so

03:06:38.100 --> 03:06:39.940
that's why I just kinda try to stay away from a lot of the

03:06:39.940 --> 03:06:44.020
crowded areas but I mean I did I not to say I like completely

03:06:44.020 --> 03:06:48.180
avoided him cuz I remember Travis Donovan and uh his wife

03:06:48.180 --> 03:06:50.740
really like to hang out at Polt's Bar which is like the

03:06:50.740 --> 03:06:53.940
central for all that stuff. So I did have to wade into it a

03:06:53.940 --> 03:06:57.780
couple times. So, um I did I did see some of that which

03:06:57.780 --> 03:06:59.860
shout out to Travis by the way. It was really good to see him

03:06:59.860 --> 03:07:04.980
this year as well as uh even more so his wife. Alright, uh

03:07:04.980 --> 03:07:07.780
one last call for calls here at Orange Lounge Radio. All one

03:07:07.780 --> 03:07:09.940
word on Skype but if we don't get anything then I think we'll

03:07:09.940 --> 03:07:11.780
wrap things up but anything else you wanted to do uh

03:07:11.780 --> 03:07:14.580
mention Loki? No. Can we get out of here for the night? Uh

03:07:14.580 --> 03:07:17.460
it's been it's been a long time since we've done a show. So,

03:07:17.460 --> 03:07:20.180
I'm. Yes. Really glad we were back tonight. So, alright.

03:07:20.500 --> 03:07:25.860
Well, let me oh uh Rage Nator just posted a picture. So, I'm

03:07:25.860 --> 03:07:28.740
gonna take a look right now at that picture. I mean, I'm

03:07:28.740 --> 03:07:30.900
probably not going to remember it but let's see. You never

03:07:30.900 --> 03:07:34.420
know. Oh, that's a really good cosplay for what it's worth.

03:07:34.420 --> 03:07:40.900
Damn. Is that your friend? Okay. So, like uh again, it's a

03:07:40.900 --> 03:07:43.380
radio show. So, I'm having a hard time. It's it's a they

03:07:43.380 --> 03:07:45.620
took the picture in front of the oh they must have done this

03:07:45.620 --> 03:07:48.580
at the Georgia Aquarium on Thursday cuz they actually so

03:07:48.580 --> 03:07:50.900
they actually have a picture in front of all these fish to

03:07:50.900 --> 03:07:52.820
make it look like it's underwater and it's it's uh

03:07:52.820 --> 03:07:55.540
it's really well done. So, I mean, props on the cosplay.

03:07:55.540 --> 03:07:57.460
That's. Scared all the kids at the aquarium. Yeah, scare

03:07:57.460 --> 03:08:00.260
everybody there. That's uh pretty good. Alright. Well, no

03:08:00.260 --> 03:08:02.260
other calls are coming in. So, I think we're gonna close up

03:08:02.260 --> 03:08:04.020
the Skype line but I will say if you didn't get through

03:08:04.020 --> 03:08:06.500
tonight but you do wanna say something, you can get to us on

03:08:06.500 --> 03:08:09.460
Discord. You can uh send us a Twitter message or any of that

03:08:09.460 --> 03:08:12.820
stuff. All of that would work very well and um yeah,

03:08:12.820 --> 03:08:15.460
participate at Orange Andrade.com to send us an email.

03:08:15.460 --> 03:08:20.260
So, um anyway, I did wanna say uh a big thanks uh to everybody

03:08:20.260 --> 03:08:22.500
for being here especially after we've been off for a couple

03:08:22.500 --> 03:08:24.900
weeks. I know it can throw off your rhythm. So, thank you so

03:08:24.900 --> 03:08:27.140
much for uh finding us again or maybe you found us for the

03:08:27.140 --> 03:08:29.300
first time. Uh thanks for being with us here on Orange

03:08:29.300 --> 03:08:32.500
Andradeo. Uh we don't uh ask for money uh here at Orange

03:08:32.500 --> 03:08:35.140
Andradeo. All we ask is that you spread the word. Help

03:08:35.140 --> 03:08:38.020
tell a friend or two or five about the show. Help us spread

03:08:38.020 --> 03:08:39.940
the word because we are the show where every gamer has a

03:08:39.940 --> 03:08:43.300
voice but only if the voices are here to air their

03:08:43.300 --> 03:08:47.140
grievances uh as YY did earlier in the program. Uh so

03:08:47.140 --> 03:08:51.380
anyway, um a nice five-star review on iTunes or Google Play

03:08:51.380 --> 03:08:54.100
wherever you found this show. Uh the that all goes a very

03:08:54.100 --> 03:08:57.220
long way as well. We really appreciate all that. So, I think

03:08:57.220 --> 03:08:59.940
on that note, we're gonna wrap things up. Uh Loki, your final

03:08:59.940 --> 03:09:04.260
thought. My final thought is go play old school musical. It's

03:09:04.260 --> 03:09:08.340
pretty fun. My final thought is I will. There you go. Alright,

03:09:08.340 --> 03:09:11.460
done deal. My final thought is I hope my internet gets fixed

03:09:11.460 --> 03:09:14.420
cuz I miss streaming on Twitch but at least I'm starting to

03:09:14.420 --> 03:09:16.740
get creative and think of workarounds but it's gonna be

03:09:16.740 --> 03:09:18.900
very hard to move this show to Twitch if we can't stream on

03:09:18.900 --> 03:09:21.780
Twitch but I guess we could always just do a low bit rate.

03:09:21.780 --> 03:09:26.340
I didn't say the video would have to be HD quality. Alright.

03:09:26.340 --> 03:09:29.300
Uh but that's really it. We're done for the night and we'll

03:09:29.300 --> 03:09:31.140
see you next time here on Orange Andradeo. Thanks for

03:09:31.140 --> 03:09:35.460
being here. Till next time. Like seriously, just don't be an

03:09:35.460 --> 03:09:38.740
**** gamer. It's not hard. Don't be an ****. Just get out

03:09:38.740 --> 03:09:41.620
of bed today and say, I'm not gonna be an **** and then

03:09:41.620 --> 03:09:45.460
hopefully, you won't. You've been listening to Orange Lounge
