1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
750 episodes, 750, that's a significant number and a heck of a lot of content from this music game turned all things gaming show.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
From us in NorCal straight to your ears, this is still the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back, it's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, episode number 750.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
750, just like Jason said in the intro there.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
For this, October the 28th of 2018.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Happy Halloween y'all out there, since I know many folks are celebrating, you know, this weekend.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Because Halloween's not really a lot of fun on a Wednesday, but maybe some of you guys will be trick-or-treating or maybe playing some scary games over the week, we'll see.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Anyway, say hello to our co-hosts, welcome back to Studio Tonight.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I know she's been on the show thanks to Radio Magic, but it's so nice to have her here in person during this work period.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Why do we call cookies cookies when you bake them?

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Aren't they bakies?

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Little bakies?

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Bakies.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't know.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Biscuits.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And then it could be get baked off bakies.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Not these.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
By the way, this is a really funny story actually, I don't know, maybe it's not funny, but before we were on air tonight.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So DarkSakura made cookies to bring to the show.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Anzac biscuits.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Which was very kind of you to do.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Bakies.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And then she said when she was explaining them to Loki, because Loki doesn't always eat every food you put in front of him.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I might as well just say hi to Tag Master Loki.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hi, Loki.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hi.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So Loki doesn't always eat everything you put in front of him.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
He's what you call a picky eater, which is fine.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm not picky, I just have a diet that I have.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And cookies are a lot of calories.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's a convenient excuse.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So anyway.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I ate cookies yesterday, it's just, you know.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Alright, anyway, fine.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
They were soy cookies.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Anyway, so DarkSakura, in explaining them to Loki, said they were special cookies.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You put weed in these cookies?

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And DarkSakura goes, yeah.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Like totally without skipping a beat.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And I'm like, Jamie, you're supposed to, like, you can't do that to your friends.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I thought you said wheat.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah, they're cookies.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
She thought I said wheat.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Like, yeah, they're cookies.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
They're made with flour.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I was like, why would you give me wheat cookies?

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And not tell me, like, before the show.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Because that's an awesome thing to do for episode 750.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No, that's a horrible prank to play on your friends.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Don't do that.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That's not nice.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So I don't care if it's legal in California now.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Some people have issues.

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Who could use a good stoning?

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Anyway.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Jamie, how has the last month or so been treating you?

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah, same TBH.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Same.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Anyway.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It was a lot of pinball.

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Really.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah.

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I've been trying to play my theater of magic and get better at it.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Dan's like, cool, I could just show you everything.

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
No, I want to learn it for myself.

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And finally I broke down and read the rule sheet.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I keep forgetting.

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
They do make, like, official rules for pinball, even though, like, very few of us have probably

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
ever seen them because they don't really exactly put them in arcades easily.

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Well, they might, like, hang them on the wall or something, but most people don't think

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
to look for them.

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You can get them now from the, like, the pinball internet database or something.

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The internet?

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The interwebs.

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Anything is possible.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And then Dan and I were watching the mini Games Done Quick from TwitchCon.

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah.

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That was pretty good.

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We watched the blindfold Symphony of the Night run.

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh, that's fun.

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And just listening to the cues, though, I was like, I see how he's doing it.

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But you still have to have a good bit of memorization in on that one.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Have you picked up the Castlevania, like, combo pack?

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I forget the Requiem or whatever they called it.

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Not yet.

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's on the PS4.

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Not yet.

94
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
How do you feel about the fact that they use the newer voice acting as opposed to the classic?

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't mind.

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah?

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
All right.

98
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I mean, the old one was cheeseball and great in its own light, but, you know, I really

99
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
don't mind.

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Well, fair enough.

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I just wish that they would, like, do an HD version of the Saturn one.

102
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah, that would be nice to use kind of like that as the base, even though it makes sense

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
because, you know, this PlayStation 4 that this back came out on, it makes sense.

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But yeah, I'd like to see the same one.

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I want to play through it as Richter or Maria.

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I've never gotten to play the game as Maria, so I would love to check that out.

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Actually, we'll have to have you over to do a Saturn stream.

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That'll be fun.

109
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Of Nocturne in the Moonlight, which I still think is a better name than Symphony of the

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Night.

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes, it would be a good time.

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Because it's the same as, you know, Rondo and Nocturne.

113
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
They're the same type of thing instead of just a symphony.

114
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
at the VoiceGeeks network, vognetwork.com.

116
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Let's see.

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Fifth Dream says, I make cookies with coconuts, not wheat.

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But your-

119
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
These also have coconuts in them.

120
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
They also say they have both.

121
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Actually, my dear friend JJ, who has been in the chat a few times, gave me this recipe

122
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
for Anzac cookies or biscuits that were, I think for World War II, that were made to

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
send off because they didn't need a lot of preservative or something.

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Right.

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll have to find the official story again, but they're really delicious.

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
They're made with coconut and rolled oats and golden syrup and baking soda.

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Cooking with Sakura.

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Anyway, just to make sure I get the full plug in there so that Bobby gets his free plug.

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,

130
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the VoiceGeeks network, vognetwork.com,

131
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
that's vognetwork.com.

132
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Some other comments in chat.

133
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
MegamanX400, our pal Delvin, who was here about three weeks ago, says, come on, episode 750.

134
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Woo, death drop.

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You missed a fun episode, not being able to be here when Delvin was here.

136
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It was a fun episode.

137
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It was very sad.

138
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I was also really sad that I was so sick the day before.

139
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh, yeah.

140
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
After brunch.

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh, yeah.

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But we got to go.

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
At least you got to meet him.

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
We got to all go hang out and that was fun.

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah.

146
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It was good times.

147
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Anyway, let's get into our video game kickoff topic.

148
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We actually have like a couple of smaller topics tonight.

149
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Well, first, I really actually, even before the kickoff topic, the pre-kickoff topic,

150
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
the singing of the national anthem part.

151
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let's talk about the fact that we are episode 750.

152
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I mean, it's kind of a landmark number.

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
There's not a lot of gaming podcasts that have gotten this high in number.

154
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Or have gotten this high in general.

155
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Well, here's the, if you want to get technical, if they're only weekly, I mean, we've been

156
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
running the longest since 2002, just about every week.

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I would say we miss one out of every eight shows or so just because, you know, sickness,

158
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
holiday, whatever else comes up.

159
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But as far as pretty regularly weekly, we're the longest running.

160
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We know that.

161
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But there are other shows that maybe are twice a week, three times a week, or shows

162
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
that will do like a bunch of shows during E3 or PAX, like if they load up on interviews.

163
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So, you know, it kind of depends on how you're counting.

164
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So I would say there's a handful of gaming shows that have probably hit around 750 just

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
because they might do the multiple show thing, whether it's that they're multiple times a

166
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
week or what have you.

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But regardless, I mean, we've been doing this for 750 weeks off and on.

168
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So, I mean, what do you guys think?

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Like, how do things look now for gaming as opposed to when we first started?

170
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Like, did you ever kind of think we'd be doing some of the stuff now with games?

171
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Did you ever think you'd be playing something like the games you're playing today, like

172
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
a DDR machine in your garage, Loki, when we first started our show way back on episode

173
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
one?

174
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I didn't know if I'd...

175
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah, sure.

176
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I thought I would have one by then.

177
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Let's see.

178
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Dark Sakura, did you ever think your pinball collection would be so big?

179
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Kind of, yeah.

180
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Because I mean, keep in mind, it wasn't too long after we started the show that Dan started

181
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
collecting the pinball.

182
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I appreciate this here.

183
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Tabiri in chat says, you guys don't look a day over 500 episodes.

184
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That is so true.

185
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It really is.

186
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Kind of taking a look down memory lane for a minute here, because I always think this

187
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
is kind of fun to see, like, well, what were we talking about back in the day?

188
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And thankfully, we have a wiki that kind of like helps us out and we can go way back.

189
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Now, unfortunately, like some episodes are so old that they haven't been like chronicled

190
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
in the wiki yet.

191
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But if I went back to say, if I went back to the to-go era, I think we did do an episode

192
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
50 in the to-go era.

193
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Okay, here we go.

194
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So episode 50 of our to-go podcast was on December 12th of 2005, and it covered the

195
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Xbox 360 Japanese launch.

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Well, how do you how do you guys all think that went?

197
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Space poncherific.

198
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Well, well, you know what?

199
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
They tried.

200
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
They tried to Japan, probably more so than they did with the one, because they were trying

201
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
to, you know, team up with certain key players.

202
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That fact that they had Mistwalker with Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon was a thing, you know,

203
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
they kind of tried.

204
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But I guess it just wasn't enough to really, you know, the Xbox 360 and Microsoft in general

205
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
just never really caught on in Japan.

206
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I think it's like kind of more of a niche thing.

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It still hasn't.

208
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
No, and it still hasn't.

209
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You're right.

210
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It really hasn't.

211
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Let's see.

212
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And yeah, Dartusuya says, those are the old shows.

213
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I know many of the earlier episodes weren't archived.

214
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I probably have MP3s of almost all of them.

215
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I mean, there's there's some that are probably lost forever, but I have a good, good many

216
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
of them.

217
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Let's see.

218
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Going back to other nice big round numbers.

219
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
How about episode number 200 on September 17th of 2006?

220
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
We did Wii release date and price.

221
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So that's when we finally heard the when the Wii was coming out.

222
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Did you see that story this week, by the way, of the I guess they found a GameCube version

223
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
of the Wii controller.

224
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Did you see that?

225
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Like a prototype that so so when people were really developing for the Wii, it really was

226
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
a GameCube just duct taped to another GameCube in theory.

227
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's see what else was on that episode.

228
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
DDR power previews.

229
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't remember what that was.

230
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And then we did like we did an extra long episode that night because 200 was a big deal.

231
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Let's see.

232
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let's go back to 250.

233
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I won't do every multiple 50.

234
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
We'll cut a wrap here.

235
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Episode 250.

236
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
We not too big of a celebration.

237
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The wiki notes.

238
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But we hit the 250 episode mark.

239
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Stories included Halo DS.

240
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That was Halo DS was a thing.

241
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah, there was a fan like indie fan game.

242
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't even remember that.

243
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
OK, it was an indie fan game.

244
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
OK, got it.

245
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Well, actually, I don't know.

246
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It may have been something they were considering of developing.

247
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I remember I remember it vaguely, but like I don't remember if it was something like

248
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Microsoft was thinking about publishing this on the DS because they didn't have a platform

249
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
that was portable or if it was like, well, I remember they did something.

250
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Some of the Viva Pinata stuff ended up on DS.

251
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So, yeah, so I think that may have been I remember there's like video of it and stuff.

252
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't know.

253
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Let's see.

254
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And let's see.

255
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Eight bit the movie and episode number 250 was also the debut of Dark Sakura's classic

256
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
game of the week.

257
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Before that, we hadn't done that before.

258
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You used to have other segments.

259
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You had like what was it?

260
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Website of the week.

261
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And you had some advice column thing that you like.

262
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Don't set yourself on fire.

263
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't remember what it was.

264
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's like we should do an advice advice column again.

265
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You want to bring that back?

266
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah, maybe I should do like a Dear Abby thing on our website.

267
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's called like Ask Dark Sakura.

268
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
There you go.

269
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Now, that's good content to bring people to our website.

270
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You should you should think about that.

271
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Ask Dark Sakura some shit.

272
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
All right.

273
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I love it.

274
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Don't be an asshole.

275
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Let's see.

276
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Let's see.

277
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'll do one more hand in chat.

278
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
If you want me to do that.

279
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'll do one more.

280
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Let's see.

281
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Going.

282
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,640
Oh, you know, what's funny is it just if my screen froze for a minute on episode 285,

283
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,880
that was the Tommy Tallarico week.

284
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
That was when he came on.

285
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,280
I bring that up because we had the television news last week.

286
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,280
Forgot all about that.

287
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Yeah.

288
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
Right.

289
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,280
And I sort of remember that.

290
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
But you don't remember when he came on the show.

291
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,960
I sort of remember that six hour long show.

292
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,920
You think the show is long usually that episode went all night.

293
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,920
That man can talk.

294
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,920
He can.

295
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,920
He's great.

296
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,920
He's just he loves what he does.

297
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
What can you say?

298
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,920
It's not a bad thing.

299
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
Bring him on again.

300
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,840
I will definitely send him an email as an invite, although it'll probably be better

301
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,760
to get a little closer to when, you know, the Amico has a little more show.

302
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,760
Sorry.

303
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,080
When the show's over, Amico be out.

304
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,080
Let's see.

305
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,720
My my screen is freezing up over here, but let me see if I get because I'm on this ancient

306
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,680
computer, which by the powers of Windows XP, I should say this, too.

307
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,180
We're not going to be able to use Skype on this machine after next week.

308
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:03,460
So tonight may be the last night you can use Skype to call into the show.

309
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,460
I don't know yet.

310
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,460
Or at least for a little bit.

311
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,280
We have to just take a break from Skype.

312
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,720
We have to see some other people for a little bit until we get the new computer and all

313
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,480
that set up for the new studio.

314
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
We'll see.

315
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
All right.

316
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:22,620
On the 500th episode of O.L.R., our Wiki says some features, some features of the original

317
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,540
Wii are going offline.

318
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,840
So episode 250 was the Wii is coming out.

319
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,020
Episode 500 was the Wii is going offline.

320
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,940
I don't know why that's so funny, but it is.

321
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,940
And then Tomb Raider got a Japanese language pack for $30.

322
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,740
So you could you could play the game in Japanese for a price.

323
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,940
And I think that was a pretty big controversy that was going on at the time.

324
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,180
And we did match game on episode 500.

325
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,740
We haven't played one of our little games in quite some time.

326
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,980
We used to be really known for those.

327
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,980
We just kind of.

328
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,320
I mean, without dark soccer being here regularly, we haven't really been able to do listless

329
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
as much.

330
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,900
And, you know, we used to do more of those games when our studio would really be full

331
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,100
of people, because in the early days of O.L.R., especially like those years that you and I

332
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,340
lived in that apartment, like I felt like we had like seven people on the show every

333
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,340
week.

334
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,340
It was nuts.

335
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,340
So, yeah.

336
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,860
So the games that Webcam with the one frame every ten seconds.

337
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,860
Yeah.

338
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,860
Now we're talking about moving back to Twitch.

339
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,820
Y'all, for a while, you used to go you used to go to our Web site or it's not really a

340
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,820
com.

341
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:29,700
And we had a Webcam picture that would refresh once every like 15 seconds.

342
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,700
Powers of the Internet.

343
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,700
I know.

344
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,700
Right.

345
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,300
And now it's like, well, we're going back to it.

346
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,300
What?

347
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,260
The stream is only 30 frames per second.

348
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,780
That's just terrible.

349
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,780
I love it.

350
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,780
All right.

351
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,580
Anyhow, let's get into some kickoff topics for tonight.

352
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,820
Let's talk about Nintendo Labo in schools.

353
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:55,920
So Nintendo Labo is apparently going to be a part of some curriculums.

354
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,260
They're saying Labo is going to be integrated in 100 U.S. classrooms throughout the current

355
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,260
school year.

356
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:07,100
This according to a Nintendo announcement with the nonprofit Institute of Play.

357
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,800
Students in grades two through four are going to be able to build Labo projects focusing

358
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,360
on the basic concept of STEAM, communication, creativity, critical thinking and problem

359
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,640
solving.

360
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,120
You can apply to join the program.

361
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,200
If you happen to be a teacher, I know we actually have gamer teachers listen to the show.

362
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,680
You go to the Institute of Play's Web site and you can be a part of this program.

363
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,160
If you're selected, you get guidance from Nintendo and the Institute, a companion teacher

364
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,040
guide that has a whole curriculum in it and the whole other like I guess the actual guide

365
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,840
will be made available to free for anyone later in the year.

366
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,840
So that's kind of cool.

367
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,240
The Institute of Play does want to do a diverse group of schools around the U.S. urban, suburban,

368
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,540
rural areas and so forth.

369
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,400
So what do you guys think about Labo being used in the classroom?

370
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,840
You know, I remember when Nintendo first announced Labo, it was kind of like, it kind of got

371
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,480
some mixed reaction, I think, from the gamer fans.

372
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,120
But I think there were definitely those of us that looked at that and said, well, it's

373
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,840
not really meant to be a game.

374
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,340
This is Nintendo's way to kind of find another niche in the toy market.

375
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,920
This is kind of like the reverse of toys to games.

376
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,380
It's games to toys.

377
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,380
It's neat.

378
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:17,580
It's like it reminds me of like those Lego, the robotic sets that they have, you know,

379
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:22,820
where they do a lot of I've seen like different classes through, you know, could be schools

380
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,220
or could be just like the most random one I've seen is they have this place called Bounce

381
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,540
You, which is like one of those bounce house places that you go and jump on bounce houses

382
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,620
for like an hour.

383
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,420
But then they also do like this, like robotics camp or like night out thing where it's like

384
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:43,180
you can drop your kids off and they build robots for using the Lego Mindstorm stuff.

385
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,820
It's kind of like that, except it's Labo.

386
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,820
And I don't know.

387
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:54,660
I mean, granted, the software is pretty good, but I don't know how easy it is to create

388
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,340
these new things versus like putting bricks together.

389
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,340
Yeah.

390
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,340
Yeah.

391
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:06,660
So you've got a young kid, but like your kid is not quite at the age where they're doing

392
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,620
this type of like educational gaming in the classroom yet, right?

393
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,620
He plays.

394
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,620
He has his own.

395
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,060
Well, usually he would have his own Chromebook in the class.

396
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,060
Oh, wow.

397
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,900
So they do like something on that.

398
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:26,520
I don't know what he does exactly on that, but like they do like typing and they earn

399
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,000
credits doing things on there to play like educational games, I guess.

400
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Like so long.

401
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:41,040
So they can like he tends to save all of his credits, like play an hour of games at a time.

402
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
OK, that's I guess that's good.

403
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,600
He's learning investment early on.

404
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
That's good.

405
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
That's a good thing.

406
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,440
So they have like Chromebooks and stuff in classes.

407
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
OK.

408
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,400
Because I just I remember, you know, back in my day when I was a kid, it was all about,

409
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,040
you know, when we were in what, like the fourth grade?

410
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,600
I think it wasn't until like the fourth grade.

411
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:04,160
I remember going to the computer lab to play the Oregon Trail and number munchers.

412
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
And I remember taking like a logo.

413
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,480
I remember taking a nighttime class.

414
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,520
It was about logo and that stuff was like an enrichment thing.

415
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,440
I remember my dad went with me to something like that was like a turtle.

416
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,440
Yeah.

417
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,440
Logo was the turtle.

418
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
It's like learning how to program.

419
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,640
And so that way you think about flow charts and design and things like that.

420
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,920
It's actually I don't think we ever got that far as more of like, OK, put these commands

421
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
in.

422
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
And what do you get?

423
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,120
You know, it's like, OK, I go to our chat over at live dot vog network dot com.

424
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
Let's see.

425
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,200
Guys, you don't chat says the only way Labo is a good idea is if they give it to the school

426
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,880
without making the teachers buy it.

427
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,720
Well, I would assume if Nintendo is in on this, it's not something you have to buy it.

428
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,880
I'm curious to see what it is like.

429
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,200
The idea doesn't sound terrible, but it's just.

430
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,800
I don't know, like if if it's just a software like some specific kits like, OK, here you

431
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,200
can make this thing out of it.

432
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
That's fine.

433
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,400
That's kind of you can be creative and stuff with.

434
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:03,360
But at the same time, like I think like it would be more intuitive, like for like Arduino

435
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,860
or something like that, like, for example, someone we know, Mr. Punk Knight, you know,

436
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:15,540
he is a teacher in middle school and he teaches computer science and stuff.

437
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:21,120
And so he actually does like Arduino and robotics and 3D printing stuff in his class.

438
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,120
Wow.

439
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:31,560
You know, like that, if that was in like an elective when I was back in junior high, I

440
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,560
would have taken that shit.

441
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,440
I took the best I could do was American Technologies, which was like an engineering class and mechanical

442
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,720
drawing, which, you know, is like drafting.

443
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,080
So we didn't have any sort of my elective, like all throughout high school was banned,

444
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,640
which I mean, I don't regret.

445
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,640
Yeah.

446
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,520
You're a fellow band geek to Bobby Blackwell's, a fellow band geek, like, you know, us band

447
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,800
geeks turned out OK.

448
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:57,600
And I think still kind of have a lot of a lot of overlap with gaming and all that stuff.

449
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,360
Remember, it ain't a party until the contract contract to a clarinet player shows up.

450
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,480
Well, I mean, there's a reason that there was that running joke in that movie American

451
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:12,440
Pie where at this one time at band camp, because it's all true, you know, nerds were freaks.

452
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,880
We didn't have like a camp that you went to like that.

453
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,080
We had a swamp in the backfield at school that we would just march in.

454
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,080
Oh, we had band camp.

455
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,040
But it wasn't like it wasn't like you went away for three days.

456
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
It was band camp.

457
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,640
Well, my quote fingers was that three days, like a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday before

458
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,340
the school semester started, you only three days.

459
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,280
I think it was only three days or two weeks.

460
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,280
Wow.

461
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,720
That's well, we did the three days and then we also did like one night a week through

462
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,640
the rest of the year, like an extra like field practices.

463
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,900
That's how we learned the field shows, basically, you know, which the field show and band is

464
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,200
when they do all those little patterns out on the football field.

465
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
You guys have all seen that before.

466
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,680
Yeah, no, we did.

467
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,320
We did two weeks.

468
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,200
There was like marching fundamentals and then we would learn the show and memorize a lot

469
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,880
of our music, which I mean, it's well, this show did start as a music gaming show.

470
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,100
And I think like music games in some ways, I don't want to say it was really like the

471
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,640
gateway that got me into games because I was playing games before music games like still

472
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,120
waiting for sex maniacs.

473
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,920
Music games really made me love video games in a whole nother way.

474
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,640
I don't know if that makes sense.

475
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,040
Kind of made me finally make sitar hero and actually there wasn't like a real game.

476
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,480
It was a flash game on the love guru website for that terrible movie.

477
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,600
I know, but it was still funny.

478
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,720
Yeah, sitar hero.

479
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,240
Exactly.

480
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
How long do we joke about it?

481
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,680
So, I mean, what would you guys like to what do you guys think gaming could do?

482
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,160
And I open this up to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

483
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:46,120
It doesn't just have to be Labo, but what types of games do you think could help people

484
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,640
learn?

485
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:52,120
What do you think are some good like learning types of games that kids could be playing?

486
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,920
You know, when I was in junior high school, we used to just kind of on our lunch, we used

487
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,720
to play, um, scorched earth.

488
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,200
I was thinking the same thing.

489
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Yes.

490
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Right.

491
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Do you remember that scorcher?

492
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,560
And that's when you would learn about angles and velocity.

493
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,640
So everybody's played a game like scorched earth.

494
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,080
I'm sure like years ago there was another, it was a tank wars was the other big one that

495
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,760
used to, which is basically all of these games, worms, like, right.

496
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,360
Worms is kind of like, but worms now you could like move the worms and you wouldn't really

497
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
do that.

498
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,360
And scorched earth.

499
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,360
I guess that's right.

500
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,160
You get like little developments for the tanks and you can move them.

501
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
Right.

502
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,360
So anyway, those like scorched earth was all about being able to like shoot the nuke over

503
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,720
the hill and you got to get the right velocity and angle.

504
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
And it was actually kind of fun.

505
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
Like, I don't know.

506
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,520
Like, I feel like we learned a lot playing that game, but like our science teacher used

507
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,920
to love to let us come in and use the computers to play scorched earth on lunch.

508
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,920
He thought it was hilarious.

509
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,920
So, yeah.

510
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,920
Yeah.

511
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,800
I mean, I don't know what they could play.

512
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,320
I mean, I know that Minecraft has its own, like they have a whole programming thing that

513
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,880
you can do with Minecraft as well, cause they're all redstone stuff.

514
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,560
So they actually have like a coding Minecraft thing.

515
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,560
I mean, I don't know.

516
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,880
I think like there could be other tools that they could make that be able to do like something

517
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,640
I don't really know what we're trying to teach our children is what I'm thinking.

518
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,360
You know, a lot of it's just like, depends on the age.

519
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:22,120
Like right now, you know, it's more of like typing skills, you know, maybe like a second

520
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,120
language.

521
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,960
Do they teach your kids how to write as much as they teach them how to type?

522
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,640
They teach them how to write more than typing.

523
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,600
Typing's more of like, here, here's your login to this, you know, typing site.

524
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,440
Cause I would swear that cursive is going to become a lost art.

525
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,400
I would like being able to write cursive, like that seems like the type of thing that

526
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,680
like in like 30 years, I don't know.

527
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,840
Maybe I'm, maybe I'm just being crazy, but like, is it just me, but it seemed like cursive

528
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,840
is one of those things.

529
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,240
How often do you write in cursive?

530
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,000
When I sign my name.

531
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah.

532
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
When I sign my name, that's it.

533
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,420
When I sign my name, I write in cursive.

534
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,880
Do you ever write in cursive, Darksira?

535
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,880
All the time actually.

536
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,200
Of course she does.

537
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,200
Of course.

538
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Of course she does.

539
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,200
It's always Jamie when there's something.

540
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,680
I was writing cursive before it was popular.

541
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,800
She used her hammer and chisel to do it.

542
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:13,560
Well, no, but I'm also going back and trying to learn proper calligraphy because I mean,

543
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,040
to me it's, it is kind of an art form.

544
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,660
I could see it as like an art.

545
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,520
If you have an artistic interest in absolutely like cursive and calligraphy.

546
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,260
I'm not trying to like slam cursive, but I'm just saying like in the real world, how often

547
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,920
do you use cursive outside of signing your name?

548
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
Because now it's typing.

549
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,180
You got to know how to type.

550
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,180
You have to know how to type.

551
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:34,640
Well, when I, when I hand take notes, it's actually kind of funny because sometimes I

552
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,680
will switch in between using cursive and script in the middle of my notes or writing

553
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,860
letters or I'll combine the letters cause they're easier to hand write in cursive than

554
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,760
they are in print, especially after, you know, having three hand surgeries.

555
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,840
Although I also will sometimes find that I've started writing my notes backwards.

556
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,120
I mean complete backwards mirror image cause I can do that and it happens sometimes.

557
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
Okay.

558
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,680
Hey word.

559
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,480
Bob coffee and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says educational games should also teach critical

560
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,000
thinking because a lot of today's kids are fucking morons.

561
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,760
Well, that seems to be a very broad stroke, but yes, they do need to teach critical thinking.

562
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,380
I mean, I was just thinking the other day about like, are we teaching our kids in schools

563
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:24,120
how to spot fake shit on social media and how to like, like, like seriously, like I

564
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,160
don't mean to get all like political, but like I would think in this day and age you

565
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,280
want to teach people at a young age how to spot fake shit online because there's a lot

566
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,280
of it.

567
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:37,000
I think that they should go back instead of making like debate part of, you know, like

568
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,800
an extracurricular thing or making it part of like a particular class.

569
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,560
They should teach rhetoric.

570
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:49,000
Now, the communication class that I was in was like a group debate class in college,

571
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,940
but he, my, my, uh, my professors actually had his masters in rhetoric and part of what

572
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:00,640
rhetoric teaches is how to decide what is a fallacious argument.

573
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,800
You know, how to point out when you're heading into a fallacy like slippery slope argument,

574
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,100
straw man arguments, you know, let me, let me steer us back on course a little bit because

575
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,480
even though this is a good conversation, it is games.

576
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,280
Something that should be taught.

577
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,720
Is there a way we could use games to do that?

578
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,800
There could be games for that.

579
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,640
There could be, you know, spot the fallacy.

580
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,900
I mean, I would play a game like that because I do that all the time anyway on Facebook.

581
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,900
You do it for free.

582
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,900
I do it for free.

583
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,900
Why not make a game out of it?

584
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,240
That's like a high score for pointing out idiocy.

585
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:38,940
I remember playing a game on my Commodore 64 that was about running for president and

586
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,980
the things you had to do in different states to get electoral votes.

587
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,140
And it taught you like by playing this game, it taught you about like how the electoral

588
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,380
college worked and all that.

589
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,360
And look, I know that's a controversial thing, but it's the, it's the way it is.

590
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,400
So you should learn about it.

591
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,700
You should learn how your government works, whether you agree with it or not, right?

592
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,460
So like this game on the Commodore, like taught me about all that.

593
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,500
And I think, you know, those, those are the types of things that I think are really cool

594
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,020
when a game sort of helps you, like a video game helps you learn some of these more like

595
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:11,620
complex things like, like in history and all that, um, especially, uh, where in the world

596
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,620
is Carmen Sandiego?

597
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,780
Well, especially the further down the road you went with those games was great.

598
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,780
Yeah.

599
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,640
Where in time you started to really learn historical things.

600
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,980
Same thing with, um, where in, uh, I think there was where in the USA, where in the world

601
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,100
and there was another one, I don't remember what it was like.

602
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:31,020
I felt like the more they went, the more, I guess it was, there was more you would actually

603
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,860
learn about like history and the earth, but now it's kind of hard to go back and play

604
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:39,940
this because I actually tried like to pick up, you know, where in the world and it was

605
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,260
because our geography has changed so much and you know, some of those countries don't

606
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,260
even exist anymore.

607
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:50,300
It's something that you absolutely update and keep that series fresh.

608
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,300
Our chat rooms lighting up with some great comments.

609
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,940
I can't read these all, but you guys are having a good discussion in there.

610
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,940
Thank you.

611
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,660
And looking at chat at live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwell started off mentioning the

612
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:04,180
Assassin's Creed origins had the educational version where you'd learn about Egyptian mythology.

613
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,980
That was kind of a recent thing and I thought that was, Oh yeah, that was kind of like a

614
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,740
neat little side thing you could do.

615
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:14,060
I did actually bring this up when Assassin's Creed two was out that my art history teacher

616
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:20,460
used screenshots from Assassin's Creed two to talk about Renaissance Italy because it

617
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:26,300
actually had a very, as she put it, a very accurate layout of what, uh, you know, the

618
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,780
Vatican was supposed to be like then or however it was and where all these buildings were

619
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,780
laid out.

620
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,780
Right.

621
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,780
Yeah.

622
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,260
I would imagine Assassin's Creed has a lot of value in teaching art history, you know,

623
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,500
because when the designers make this game, they immerse themselves in it.

624
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,780
They have to teach themselves about all of this.

625
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:45,680
So I just remember reading about how, um, for whatever this last one that came out was

626
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:50,960
where they were actually having to go in and study like Spartan and Greek, uh, Odyssey

627
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,280
the Greek Odyssey is the Greek one, the, um, lifestyles so that they could accurately do

628
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,280
costumes.

629
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,600
Now, some of them they had to tweak, you know, to make them work, but where they were going

630
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,880
in and trying to make them as historically accurate as they could possibly be.

631
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,960
And they were consulting with historians.

632
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,200
And I think that we need more of that.

633
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,020
I want to read one more comment in chat because I think this is important and then we'll go

634
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:17,220
on to another kickoff topic we have, cause this was supposed to be a short one, but it's

635
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,220
a good discussion.

636
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:22,000
Uh, SG100 Matt says, my girlfriend is a school teacher and her feeling is that it's hard

637
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,600
to make a game for kids that will get them engaged in it.

638
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,980
Part of the reason is that kids are smart and know when they're trying to be catered

639
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,180
to.

640
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:33,700
Games that are overly educational seem lame to a lot of kids.

641
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,260
It's all about hitting those things that kids like about games and helping them to retain

642
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,700
the knowledge they learn from a game.

643
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,480
How I, and that brings up a good point.

644
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,660
How do you make educational games not lame?

645
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,240
What was it about things like number munchers and Oregon Trail from our era?

646
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,520
What made those games cool to play that didn't feel lame?

647
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,520
I'll say this.

648
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:59,160
I think in Oregon Trail, what made that game like not lame was that you had that whole

649
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,360
little side thing.

650
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,520
Well, not only cause your friends die of dysentery, that was huge, right?

651
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,760
You would put in like your friends and your frenemies.

652
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,480
So like you put in like dark Sakura and then like somewhere along the line, like dark Sakura,

653
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,040
you know, and you try to Ford the river and dark Sakura drowns and you laugh cause your

654
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
friend drowned.

655
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,040
Even though it's kind of morbid.

656
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
Sorry, dark Sakura.

657
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,960
But she's done it to me, I'm sure.

658
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,700
So anyway, but there's also those sequences where like you would go hunting for the Buffalo.

659
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,760
And so that was like the arcade part of the games.

660
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,480
It was like they made a little like, like arcade ish, which, you know, not that the

661
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,280
shooting game was that complicated, but it was reminiscent of Atari.

662
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,380
Number munchers was kind of like that number of munchers really felt like you were playing

663
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,380
an arcade game.

664
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,380
Yeah.

665
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:43,840
It was like the arcade and back then, yeah, the quality was like, this is basically just

666
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,360
a game, but you know, it's education based type.

667
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,920
And so maybe, you know, kind of piggybacking on what dark Sakura said a minute ago about,

668
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,280
you know, the assassin's creed and all that.

669
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,520
And somebody in chat brought up the fact that there's actually historical notes that you

670
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,600
can look at as you're playing assassin's creed.

671
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:04,160
Maybe that's one way to do it is to kind of put a little more education in the games that

672
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,160
we already enjoy.

673
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,160
I don't know.

674
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,340
I, I really want to see more things like that happen.

675
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:16,340
And on top of that too, now, and there's people who are going to argue against this, but I'd

676
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:23,860
like to see a lot more social commentary in games as in, you know, illustrate what terrible

677
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:30,580
things happened in the past, you know, basic game around, you know, tragic events, you

678
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:35,500
know, not necessarily to make light of those events, but to bring light to those events.

679
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,520
Because, I mean, you've got a lot of people who are now trying to deny certain things

680
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,680
in history happened and doing revisionist history, when the phrase still stands, those

681
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,600
who forget history are doomed to repeat it.

682
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,800
Hello world right now.

683
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,360
You know, I think that we really should have a lot more historical commentary in light

684
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,600
of what goes on today.

685
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
You know what?

686
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,200
That's one thing I always really liked about Gamer X, you know, the years that that was

687
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,200
around.

688
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:06,820
It wasn't just necessarily like LGBTQ plus type games, but I felt like there were a lot

689
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,340
of games that had something to say with social commentary with them.

690
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:14,100
I feel like that era, like when we were attending, you know, that show, we saw a lot of games

691
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,940
that were coming out that were not just, you know, games from a perspective, like the,

692
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:21,700
the fragments of him or something, which allows you to experience, you know, a story, you

693
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,900
know, from a different perspective that might not be yours.

694
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,140
But I remember playing this game that was like a puzzle game and it was about trying

695
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,560
to arrange three people sleeping on a bed because it was kind of a social commentary.

696
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,080
And I'm not saying it's a social, you have to agree with it or you don't agree with it.

697
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,840
It's a reflection of a social commentary on triad relationships.

698
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,240
You know, whether you get it or not, this is some people's lives, right?

699
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,240
Absolutely.

700
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,040
Um, you know, and things like, and I know, I know this game carries a lot of other weight

701
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,920
out there, but if you look at the game isolated by itself, a game like Depression Quest, why

702
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,300
did that game have the social impact that it did?

703
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:05,800
And ultimately this whole other, whoo, they came up as a result, right?

704
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:10,100
But I mean, if you go back to just the game itself, which was a text adventure game, it

705
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:15,880
was a social commentary on this thing that not everybody is necessarily experienced.

706
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,460
And it was a way for you to kind of like put yourself in the shoes.

707
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:23,920
And I think a lot of our problems in the world would be solved if we could just walk in somebody

708
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,540
else's shoes for a little bit.

709
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,440
Not all of them.

710
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,760
Basic empathy is something that a lot of people lack and it's not encouraged for people to

711
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,400
have on top of that.

712
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:39,920
If we had a little bit more focus on being able to relate and being empathetic to other

713
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:45,660
people, I'm positive we wouldn't have, well, actually I'm even going to go another layer

714
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,660
beyond that.

715
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:51,960
If history were accurately taught, you know, I was lucky enough that I had teachers who

716
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,500
would say, okay, this in your history book, it's wrong, here's what happened.

717
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:01,240
If you had more people who were willing to step away from a curriculum and actually teach

718
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,520
real things, yes, this is what really happened.

719
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,780
Yeah, your book says this, but really these people came in and killed all these people

720
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,780
or this happened.

721
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,280
It wasn't just, you know, friendly handshake and everyone was, you know, suddenly pals,

722
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
you know.

723
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,680
I think that those things need to be taught younger and younger and then teach about,

724
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:25,660
you know, where empathy comes in, the good that comes from being a compassionate human

725
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:31,300
being so that it can hopefully, well, and on top of that to teach proper sexual education

726
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:36,360
so that we don't have a bunch of asshole rapists who don't know where babies come from.

727
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:41,040
You know, it's, it's just this cult of stupidity that people are fostering.

728
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:47,200
And I honestly think that our video games could play such a role in combating that.

729
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,940
Really make them, make them fun, but put the lesson in.

730
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,860
If you've got to be sneaky about it, fucking be sneaky, but put it in there.

731
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,860
All right.

732
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,180
A good note to end on with that topic, but we can probably spend three hours talking

733
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,060
about this topic alone, but great discussion and thanks everybody in our chat.

734
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,900
I have another kickoff topic before we get to our gaming week because there's two things

735
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,900
I wanted to bring.

736
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,900
I thought that would be a short one.

737
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,620
I didn't think we'd have a lot to say, but who knew?

738
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:11,820
I want to also talk about TwitchCon because TwitchCon happened this past weekend.

739
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,460
I'm really heartbroken I couldn't go because it was just two hours away, but there was

740
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:19,900
so much going on this weekend that was just, it was quite frankly, with all due respect,

741
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,060
more important than TwitchCon.

742
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:27,460
For example, yesterday was Captain Spike from gameboo.org got married.

743
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:33,640
So congratulations and all that to him and his new husband and wish them all the best.

744
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:39,060
But also I hosted Rocky Horror last night, which is why my voice is a little bit eh today,

745
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,160
because there was all that going on.

746
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,020
So unfortunately I couldn't get to TwitchCon just because I had these other things going

747
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:48,180
on, but I was certainly watching from home and I was looking at all the pictures and

748
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,340
experiencing big time missing out syndrome, but it happens.

749
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:55,200
But then I also was listening about some of the announcements.

750
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,020
And I know as somebody who has done some streaming on Twitch and hopes to do more with this show

751
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,820
on Twitch in the future, I was very curious what they had to say with some of the announcements.

752
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,540
One of the biggest announcements they made at the Twitch keynote was that there will

753
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,220
be a squad stream feature.

754
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:13,420
In a nutshell, it's Mixer's co-stream feature finally making its way over to Twitch.

755
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,020
The Minute Mixer unleashed that.

756
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,580
We were kind of wondering how long before Twitch does something like that.

757
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,580
Here we are.

758
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:24,820
So you'll be able to stream with up to four people in a single view, which when you go

759
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,100
to any of the channels, you will see basically the quad view.

760
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,820
The chat is all linked, which I think is pretty cool.

761
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,820
Oh no, I'm sorry.

762
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,820
Chat is linked to whatever channel is your main view.

763
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:38,640
So you can kind of go to, you know, camera one, camera two, whatever you want to do.

764
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,640
Select streamers.

765
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,500
They say, well, we get to test this out later this year.

766
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,100
They're doing changes to the highlight editor.

767
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:47,580
So you could do like multiple moments in one highlight as opposed to just like everything

768
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,780
having to happen all in a row.

769
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,100
It just sounds like you kind of like string your clips together.

770
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,700
It just kind of sounds like an improvement there.

771
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,020
This sounds really exciting for discoverability for those of us that are a little more up

772
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,020
and coming.

773
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:04,940
The Twitch homepage plans to feature new partners and affiliates, streamers local to the viewer,

774
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:10,100
which is kind of interesting, up and coming streamers, which again was something Mixer

775
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,500
did that I always kind of liked.

776
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:17,340
Understanding how this competition is now kind of causing some developments.

777
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,300
That's kind of cool.

778
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,780
And then they're also talking about VIP badges is going to be something new so you can actually

779
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,480
make somebody a VIP member of your community.

780
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,700
So like if somebody maybe doesn't have the dollars to be able to subscribe, you can make

781
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:34,060
them, depending on how much you stream, you can make so many VIP members and they get

782
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,060
a special acknowledgement.

783
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,260
They get a special badge just for being there.

784
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,760
It's like a, you know, a VIP, somebody that is always there and supporting you.

785
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,240
And I know there's a few people I would definitely like want to give this to.

786
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,760
Some good moderator tools.

787
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,480
This is more for the big channels that are consistently having to timeout, kick, ban

788
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,480
people.

789
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,480
This will allow them to keep that.

790
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,120
Like it's basically like we can keep notes.

791
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:57,520
So like, you know, let's say, you know, we can make a note on Bobby Black Wolf's file

792
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,680
that like he was starting an argument about Chrono Trigger versus Super Metroid.

793
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,760
And I had to give him a timeout for five minutes.

794
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,120
I can make a note in the file there.

795
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,720
So that way, like going in your permanent record, I'm putting this in your record,

796
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,680
Bobby.

797
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,760
And then that way, if somebody saw that later on, like, oh, he's doing it again.

798
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,680
That's strike two, you know, or whatever we could, we could make notes on that.

799
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,760
So I don't even have IRC open at the moment as I'm reading.

800
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,640
I don't even want to see what Bobby's screaming in chat in response to that.

801
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
Let's see.

802
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:32,040
Uh, also for subscribers, you get to see exactly how long, uh, without it necessarily being

803
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,240
consecutive months.

804
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,120
And then I think the other big thing is with extensions, they're partnering with Snapchat

805
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,120
and the snap camera.

806
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,120
So you can do Snapchat filters on your Twitch stream, which sounds a little silly.

807
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,720
Like I have no need for those types of things, but I guess if maybe you're more of a social

808
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:53,520
ask me anything fun channel or whatever, then maybe you have a little more use for these.

809
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:58,260
But I think it's a little bit silly myself, but Loki, would you use some Snapchat filters

810
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,520
as you play DDR?

811
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,760
I don't think that would work well.

812
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,800
Make yourself a little puppy dog face as you're dancing.

813
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,800
I think that would be all sorts of broken, but yeah, sure.

814
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,960
One last thing, uh, the bounty board is going to be expanding.

815
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,800
So certain affiliates and partners get to use the bounty board to earn more money.

816
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,140
And I think this really, it really sounds like game companies that are willing to give

817
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:25,880
you like a copy of the game and even maybe some kit back, some ad dollars basically for

818
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,920
playing the game, not being negative on it.

819
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,920
Like the, the little screenshot example that they show says Assassin's Creed Odyssey brought

820
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,800
to you by Ubisoft game key included with bounty activation.

821
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,440
And then basically, uh, you have to stream it for an hour straight with an average of

822
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,820
a certain amount of viewers.

823
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,720
If you don't hit the average, you get a proportional percentage of the payout.

824
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,260
So that's kind of interesting.

825
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,420
It says no needless bad mouthing of the content.

826
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,000
Be sure to engage with the content in your community.

827
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,700
And then you have a bounties widget and you have to turn on the past broadcasts and so

828
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,700
on and so on.

829
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,440
So like they're not telling you what to say, but they, you know, it makes sense if the

830
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,760
company's going to be sponsoring you, you can't just sit there and bag on what a terrible

831
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,960
game and necessarily, yeah, it has to be criticism with purpose basically, but I would think

832
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,960
if you're doing one of these, you do have a responsibility to disclose, Hey guys, uh,

833
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,840
we're checking out a bounty provided to us by Assassin's Creed and Ubisoft today.

834
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,960
So I wanted to check this game out with y'all.

835
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,960
Let's take a look.

836
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,520
You know, you want to disclose, it's an ad basically hashtag ad, right?

837
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,520
I do it.

838
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,520
Yeah.

839
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,520
I think that sounds kind of exciting.

840
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:38,760
It'll be, it'll be interesting to see, um, uh, what levels they kind of let people participate

841
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,760
that with.

842
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,960
So, um, Bobby Black Wolf in chat is actually mentioning on a serious note.

843
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,200
I mean, he's, he's poking fun at the chrono trigger thing, but on a serious note says

844
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,160
I had total FOMO fear of missing out on not going to TwitchCon.

845
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,360
When do we squad stream Forza Horizon 4, uh, day one that it's out.

846
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,160
The only problem is you're going to be competing with Delvin and I streaming Mario Kart 8.

847
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,400
So that's going to be a big week.

848
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,280
Yeah.

849
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,280
That'd be five.

850
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,280
I'm just gonna make it a point to stream.

851
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,280
Nothing new.

852
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,080
Well, there's nothing wrong with playing retro titles.

853
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,080
It's old.

854
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,080
Why not?

855
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,280
I want like, not like old, old.

856
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,200
I want like PS one era.

857
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,200
Go for it.

858
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,000
I think there's people that will watch it.

859
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,720
I have been thinking about switching up to fourth plus on my machine and I was like,

860
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,160
you know, once I do that, I've got invite Rob over.

861
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,160
Yeah.

862
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,160
Heck yeah.

863
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,160
Heck yeah.

864
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,160
I want to play some fourth plus.

865
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,160
Yeah.

866
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,160
We need to do it.

867
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,160
We may.

868
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
We need to do like an OLR midweek stream.

869
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,920
I want to do like, I'm so disappointed.

870
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,040
Like, cause I always have to carry the brunt of the kids, but next week they're doing the

871
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,920
whole extra life stuff on Saturday.

872
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,760
So I was like, man, it'd be awesome to be able to just like play DDR all day and stream

873
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,760
it.

874
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,920
But that's a lot of DDR.

875
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,680
Well, I wouldn't be doing like doubles non-stops constantly.

876
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,960
I mean, that's the thing.

877
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,960
Yeah.

878
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,600
Well, um, let's figure that out.

879
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,440
I mean, this week might be a little crazy cause of Halloween, but maybe in two weeks,

880
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,320
why don't I come over and we'll do, um, like a strong, I'll come guest on your stream or

881
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,320
something.

882
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,320
Sure.

883
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,320
And you get me a fourth mix plus.

884
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,040
Oh, I have, I have the image in the seat, the drive, I just have to install it.

885
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,040
All right.

886
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,040
We'll make that happen.

887
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,720
So anyway, exciting things happening with Twitch.

888
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,040
Thanks to TwitchCon and hope everybody that went had a great time.

889
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,880
I know Jason who does all the voiceovers here.

890
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:26,560
If you noticed tonight, tonight's voiceover was very good, but he, you'll notice he kind

891
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,920
of didn't address the news.

892
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,020
He just said, hooray, they made it cause he did that in advance cause he's at TwitchCon.

893
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,800
So he knew he'd be there this weekend.

894
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,440
So he kind of gave us something we could use tonight.

895
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,840
It's a little, little more generic and not targeted at the news this week since he wouldn't

896
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,360
know what was going to come up in the news.

897
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,960
So, uh, I know Jason's there and having a good time.

898
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,520
So maybe we'll hear from him a little more about what it was like on the ground.

899
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:51,040
And I know some streamers that I, I watch, um, and interact with went, so, um, hopefully

900
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,400
we'll get to go next year.

901
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,760
Uh, just wasn't in the cards this year.

902
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,240
I really, please don't pick Halloween weekend next year.

903
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,240
You guys, please don't pick Halloween weekend.

904
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,600
And it's, you know what else is terrible about Halloween weekend?

905
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,000
Next week is BlizzCon.

906
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,880
And then the week after that, or two weeks after that is Final Fantasy Fan Fest, which

907
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,880
I'm, which I realize not as many people are into, but I am.

908
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,100
So it's like, Oh, back to back to back stuff.

909
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,100
So crazy.

910
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,100
Crazy.

911
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,100
Anyway.

912
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,100
Uh, let's get into our gaming weeks.

913
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,480
Let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week, dark

914
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,480
soccer.

915
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,480
How was your gaming month?

916
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,320
Um, I've been playing a lot of Pokemon go.

917
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,280
Um, I'm still playing idle pouring.

918
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:36,320
I've gotten back into playing a lot of bejeweled because this is going to sound stupid, but

919
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,200
it really helps me relax right before bed.

920
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:46,120
Um, and I'm also, um, I've got my wow subscription, but I haven't played in a while, which I really

921
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:50,480
should now that people I know are playing and I kind of want to move my demon hunter

922
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,240
over to proud more.

923
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,440
I just need, you know, a guild to be in.

924
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,440
I'm proud more.

925
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:02,420
Um, other than the one I have, I need a, I need an Alliance Guild.

926
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,000
Talk to Delvin cause he's the one that hooked me up.

927
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Yeah.

928
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
We also, you know, there's also communities, there's not just guild, but communities.

929
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Yeah.

930
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
But I want to be in a guild.

931
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,820
But well I know, but also I was thinking anyway, just set up a community and somebody had the

932
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,820
brilliant idea.

933
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,820
I think that was me.

934
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:18,820
Was it you?

935
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:19,820
That conversation.

936
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:20,820
Yes.

937
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,820
You said call it death cake.

938
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,500
After the, our old final fantasy 11 guild that we all used to play in.

939
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,660
So other than that, I wanted to call it link shell.

940
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,660
Yeah.

941
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:29,660
I like that.

942
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,660
That would have been funny.

943
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,660
That's good.

944
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:36,580
Um, but I've been playing a lot of, um, uh, theater of magic because I fucking love theater

945
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:42,100
of magic and um, we may be selling a couple of our tables.

946
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,380
Local people hit us up.

947
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:51,480
Um, and then I'm consider, I'm trying to consider what I want to stream from PS one or Saturn

948
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,460
era and I'm leaning towards symphony of the night for Saturn.

949
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,280
For Maria, do the Maria stuff cause I've never really seen that.

950
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,520
I'd be into that.

951
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,520
Maria.

952
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:05,060
Maria can steamroll through the game cause all she needs, well actually one of her spells

953
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:09,160
is super hard to control and that's the Sadie one.

954
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,160
Okay.

955
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,080
So you know in Rondo how she has her little animal friend attacks Rob.

956
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,080
Yeah.

957
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,080
Okay.

958
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:22,280
So well in, in symphony, um, she has like, they all are like magic attacks and she can

959
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:27,800
summon like a big dragon that you can control over the screen.

960
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,800
It is insane.

961
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,800
Yeah.

962
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,240
Or like, you know, a firebird instead of her little sparrows, it's, it's pretty intense.

963
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,240
Except, you know, it's just not, not as pretty honestly enough as the PlayStation one, which

964
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,960
is really stupid given that Saturn had a better 2d processor.

965
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,480
Um, but I'm still trying to decide.

966
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,760
I'm also kind of thinking of getting out, you know, a translation guide and played through

967
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,760
blue seed RPG.

968
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,760
I don't know.

969
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,760
So.

970
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,760
All right.

971
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,760
We'll see.

972
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,760
All right.

973
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,760
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

974
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:59,000
Um, my week was mainly just, uh, well a lot of dance has revolution.

975
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,800
So I was streaming most of this week, um, after work doing my, like I ended up being

976
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,000
in about like 45 minutes to 50 minutes a day.

977
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:18,560
So I catch that twitch.tv slash logy O R and then, um, beyond that, uh, Pokemon go and

978
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,040
then playing a bit of that.

979
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:26,760
And then also, um, a little bit of redhead redemption too, which is an excellent game.

980
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,560
Um, so I've been hopefully going to get into more of that.

981
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:36,140
Um, it was funny that I actually realized that like when I was downloading that, making

982
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:39,700
sure, well, of course I had enough hardware space cause I have a pro with a one terabyte

983
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,100
on there and only had 500.

984
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,100
I have a pro too.

985
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,160
And it's already full.

986
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,140
So yeah, well I haven't, I haven't been downloading a ton of stuff lately, but I noticed that

987
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:51,980
a lot of my VR stuff on there, I was like, Oh crap, I should read, don't download this

988
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:52,980
crap.

989
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:53,980
So I did that.

990
00:46:53,980 --> 00:47:00,460
And then, um, I meant to play some PlayStation VR as well, but I didn't get around to that.

991
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:01,460
Unfortunately.

992
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:05,960
Uh, yeah, lots of, lots of stuff I need to get around to, but I just haven't bothered

993
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,960
yet.

994
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,960
And on the DER side, of course, it sounds like I'm going to be putting fourth mix plus

995
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,960
on my machine now.

996
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,760
Uh, which is fine cause I've been like kinda getting, it's a little stale with extreme

997
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,760
all the time.

998
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,800
Um, be nice to go back and play some of the older stuff.

999
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:26,980
I do miss not having my 1.5 speed and I have to remember now with the vivid, um, or no

1000
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,000
vivid was, what was it?

1001
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
The solo air.

1002
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,920
I don't even know what I had to, I had to came up after was third mix.

1003
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,920
Right.

1004
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,760
I remember that vivid was a third mix, but I'm trying to think of like what mods I used

1005
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,600
to put on there when I was playing, um, normally.

1006
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:48,160
And I remember, I remember at the pocket station do custom nonstop.

1007
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:53,520
So I'm actually, I don't have a memory card slot in my machine, uh, which is unfortunate.

1008
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,200
And I had the opportunity to purchase one for like 150 bucks.

1009
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,000
I passed up on that.

1010
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,540
Now the only cheapest one I could find out $350, which I'm not buying, especially since

1011
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:07,400
I'm planning on switching my machine over to a step mania machine at some point.

1012
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:12,420
So I've actually been starting the prep work for that and the software side, picking out

1013
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,040
what I want and theme wise and everything.

1014
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,620
So that'll be coming some point soon, hopefully.

1015
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:21,660
And then, um, yeah, more red dead.

1016
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:26,140
I want to stream actual red dead and stuff and find a place to do like, you know, console

1017
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:31,020
and PC streaming in my garage, but I don't have a lot of room in there and it's kind

1018
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:36,180
of full of garbage right now and I need to like, you could get rid of the garbage.

1019
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:40,780
You know, you think that would be easy, but a lot of it is like a lot of it is my stuff.

1020
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:46,020
You know, like our garages, like houses disaster, like all my rock band stuff just sitting on

1021
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,020
the side.

1022
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,020
Did you play rock band?

1023
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:49,020
Yeah.

1024
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:53,860
But, um, I, yeah, it's, I have my 3d printing stuff out of the way and probably have some

1025
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:54,860
room there.

1026
00:48:54,860 --> 00:49:00,260
Plus, there's no heat in the winter, so that'll be not as great, but better than the summer.

1027
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,020
I'll take cold, liver, hot.

1028
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,020
Yeah.

1029
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,840
You know, as where, where layers, all right.

1030
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:10,340
My gaming week, honestly, um, because again, I haven't been buying a lot of new games lately,

1031
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:14,620
uh, just because, uh, I've been trying to watch the finances, uh, just because of some

1032
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,620
personal stuff.

1033
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:20,220
Um, but, uh, I would say I've been playing more world, world of Warcraft, uh, which I

1034
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:24,100
never thought I would like be playing it this much, but, uh, I've just kind of been into

1035
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,740
it and I finally kind of hit a point where I was kind of, I got my brew master monk up

1036
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:32,180
to about level 60 and then I was like, I want to, I need to get back to trying to do

1037
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,180
the end game stuff.

1038
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,740
So I finally used my boost on a warlock.

1039
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:40,300
And so I started playing warlock just the other night and, uh, I'm, I'm loving how fast

1040
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,300
things melt.

1041
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:46,180
Like I forgot how much easier it is to quest as DPS as it is a tank or a healer.

1042
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,740
Uh, so that's, that's been really great and I'm liking warlock so far.

1043
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:56,140
So, uh, I hit level 111 earlier this weekend, so I'm making my way up slowly to 120, which

1044
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:57,860
I'll hopefully hit, uh, before too long.

1045
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,180
So that would be very nice.

1046
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:02,260
Um, otherwise, uh, I'm also still playing Pokemon go.

1047
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:05,420
I just got my little reward, the spirit tomb.

1048
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:08,660
I just got that from the, uh, the quest that they gave you for Halloween.

1049
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:13,340
So I just got that today cause I finally, you know how you have to do 108 Pokemon with

1050
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,340
berries, right?

1051
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:17,380
Well, if you weren't already aware, did you already finish it?

1052
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,380
Because guess what?

1053
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,860
After you do that, you get to do 108 more.

1054
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,860
I did that.

1055
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:21,860
Oh good.

1056
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:22,860
Oh, so you got your spirit too.

1057
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,380
My poofy weird looking thing.

1058
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,380
Nice.

1059
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:29,580
You know, what's funny is I have that, but I still am stuck on that quest that is visit

1060
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:32,540
eight pokey stops you haven't visited before.

1061
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,860
Did that finish it today?

1062
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,100
Oh nice.

1063
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,100
Because I guess what?

1064
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:41,140
I got seven yesterday at the wedding and I need one more.

1065
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:46,700
I got, I got one in, um, uh, on flooring.

1066
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,900
I got six in, um, old town, Elk Grove.

1067
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:51,900
Oh yeah.

1068
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:52,900
There's a bunch of stuff down there.

1069
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:53,900
I never went down there before.

1070
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,900
And then I got the last one downtown around the corner from the LGBT center.

1071
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:58,900
Yeah.

1072
00:50:58,900 --> 00:50:59,900
There's a button.

1073
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,900
I mean, obviously there's a bunch of stuff downtown.

1074
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,260
I can find one easy.

1075
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:05,980
It's just a matter of like being, you know, honestly, I don't think I've been over to

1076
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,860
like the park in Rancho, the big park in Rancho Cordova.

1077
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,680
I don't think I've spun the stops over there since the game started tracking it.

1078
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,680
So you know what?

1079
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,680
I can probably just go over there.

1080
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,680
It's not a big deal.

1081
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:19,120
It's just taking the effort when, what do you have to, I'm sorry, you have to spend

1082
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,120
new stops.

1083
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,500
You have to do, well, the weird thing is you get the spirit tomb from when you catch the

1084
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:27,780
108 Pokemon, but part of the quest chain is still, you have another quest where you

1085
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,460
have to spin eight pokestops you haven't spun before.

1086
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:36,980
Oh, see that would have been nice when I just went to Santa Clara where it was all new stuff

1087
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,980
anyway.

1088
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,580
I mean, there's still places I haven't been.

1089
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:40,580
Yeah.

1090
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:44,660
Well, and I'm, I'm going to Vegas in a couple of weeks and I'll get a billion pokestops

1091
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:48,260
I haven't got before there, but that, but then that quest will be kind of gone.

1092
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,580
I'm sure I'll get one more stop.

1093
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,300
I haven't been to yet at some point.

1094
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,780
I'm sure that's inevitable.

1095
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:59,260
I still need the trade of Pokemon for one of the ones I have now because I'm on the

1096
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,260
six or whatever.

1097
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,540
I can trade you a garbage Pokemon if that's all you need.

1098
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:05,940
Well, I think I need the trade like, yeah, yeah, we can, yeah, whatever.

1099
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,540
Just trade, catch something on the house and trade it to me.

1100
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:09,540
It's easy.

1101
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,540
Oh, I've got plenty of stuff.

1102
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,540
There you go.

1103
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:12,540
There you go.

1104
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:13,540
I had a dust skull that, well, I think I threw it away.

1105
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:17,700
I had a shiny dust skull, but I gave you unknown from dragon con, right?

1106
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,700
No.

1107
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,700
Okay, done.

1108
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,700
I'll give you an unknown from dragon con.

1109
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,700
All right.

1110
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:22,700
Woo.

1111
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:24,620
I have so many of those.

1112
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:25,620
I have so many of them in my inventory.

1113
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,620
All right.

1114
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:27,620
Anyway.

1115
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:28,620
It's like another.

1116
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,620
Well, yeah, I was like, I gave you one.

1117
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:30,620
You gave me the D.

1118
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:31,620
Okay.

1119
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:32,620
Yes, right.

1120
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,180
I gave you the D. It's the only time in my life I've ever given Jamie the D.

1121
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:40,500
It's the only time in my life I've ever wanted the D. Also, it was kind of cute.

1122
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,500
Oh, thank you.

1123
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,420
She thought his D was cute.

1124
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:48,580
We are talking about unknowns that were caught at dragon con.

1125
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,020
Thank you very much.

1126
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,300
Anyway, uh, I guess that's it for my gaming week.

1127
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,300
Let's get into some gaming news.

1128
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,180
Some announcements real quick, actually, before we do news.

1129
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:01,380
We will not be here on November 18th.

1130
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,660
So that is a few weeks away.

1131
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,140
That is right before Thanksgiving.

1132
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:09,260
Uh, I will be at the final fantasy fan fest in Vegas, and that is the day we're coming

1133
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:10,260
back.

1134
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,860
So I won't get back in time for the show, sadly.

1135
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:14,060
So, uh, no show that week.

1136
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,060
Okay.

1137
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,180
Um, let's get into some gaming news, Loki.

1138
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:21,300
So this is kind of funny that I just read that they're doing this because I thought

1139
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,340
it already was on PC.

1140
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:28,820
In fact, I almost bought the game pass, um, when I got Forza.

1141
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:32,520
Um, but apparently this is a new thing.

1142
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:38,040
So Microsoft is considering, or they're, they're intending on expanding the Xbox game pass

1143
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,460
program to PC as well.

1144
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:47,260
Apparently they said that with the increased growth of gaming, um, rising or the revenue

1145
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:53,220
rising 44% that they are, um, and their service earnings increased by 36%.

1146
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:58,820
This is coming out of their, uh, financial year 2019 quarter one earnings report, um,

1147
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:05,500
that they're going to, um, this, I guess this rise in, um, earnings led them to discuss,

1148
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,560
Hey, maybe we should ask, should we expand this, you know, cross-platform like we are

1149
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,300
doing with their other games?

1150
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:16,220
Um, and so with that, you know, they said that it would fall under the titles.

1151
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,680
That would be the Xbox play anywhere label.

1152
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:22,620
And so with that, you would get, you know, like fours of the horizon, three, four gears

1153
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:29,660
of war for, um, so that's going to be included with the $10 monthly subscription.

1154
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:35,740
So yeah, I'm surprised, like, I swear, I thought that was already a thing that they had game

1155
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,860
pass that it would apply.

1156
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:41,600
Basically there would be any of the game anywhere titles because you're getting access to this

1157
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,820
library on the Xbox.

1158
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:46,540
And so just because you have it on PC, you can get access to those.

1159
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:51,340
Um, I'm not sure windows 10 was set up necessarily to support that, but I imagine the recent

1160
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:55,020
updates they've been doing, but I can purchase it through the windows 10 store though.

1161
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,020
Right.

1162
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,740
That's where it like, cause I even when I was going with game pass, we're using game

1163
00:54:58,740 --> 00:54:59,740
pass.

1164
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:03,140
No, I wasn't like at the point I was like, I was planning on purchasing Forza and it's

1165
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:07,400
like, do you want to purchase Forza or you can get it free with game pass and like this

1166
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,060
is on the windows 10 store.

1167
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,060
Oh, interesting.

1168
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,020
So that's why I thought this was already a thing.

1169
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,180
I was like, Oh, well they already have it.

1170
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:19,140
It's just, it's not that great on PC because it's only the play anywhere titles.

1171
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,860
Like I can't go play red dead redemption all of a sudden on PC.

1172
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,820
Well, I imagine it will be expanding significantly too.

1173
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:27,660
I think Microsoft's really kind of shifted focus a little bit down.

1174
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:33,620
I mean that's, that's not bad, but, um, yeah, I guess we'll have to wait and see when that

1175
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:34,900
that comes out.

1176
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:38,340
Uh, yeah, the more and more like game pass keeps expanding and stuff.

1177
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,260
I gotta say I'm really tempted with it.

1178
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:44,420
I really, really, as if I don't have enough of a backlog, like, but game pass got a lot

1179
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,420
of good stuff.

1180
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,820
Um, so yeah, that's the thing.

1181
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:50,500
Like if they have a lot of like first party tiles, it'd be nice to go back and play some

1182
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,500
of the stuff I haven't played.

1183
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:56,900
But honestly, on PC it's mainly like Forza, it's like Forza, Forza, Forza, Forza and

1184
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:57,900
Gears of War.

1185
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,700
And I guess, you know, when the Halo stuff comes out, you know, that might be a little

1186
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,700
worth it too.

1187
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:03,700
But yeah.

1188
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:04,700
All right.

1189
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:09,100
Well, uh, moving on to another story about Pokemon go clones.

1190
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,780
I don't know if you've tried some of the various Pokemon go clones out there.

1191
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:12,780
I have not.

1192
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,540
My sister plays the Jurassic Park one all the time.

1193
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,500
I was going to say some of them are pretty good.

1194
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:23,280
I hear the Jurassic Park one's pretty well received the, uh, walking, walking dead, which

1195
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,980
I haven't played yet, but I hear there's people into that one too, uh, that that one is pretty

1196
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:29,020
fun as well.

1197
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,820
And then there's some pretty crappy ones too.

1198
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:35,500
Like Garfield go is, is like, LOL stupid, really dog shit.

1199
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,500
Yeah.

1200
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:40,620
Well, I dare you to talk bad about this Pokemon go clone because you might go to hell for

1201
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,300
making fun of this one.

1202
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:45,000
It is JC go.

1203
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,220
It was designed by a Catholic evangelical group.

1204
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:53,040
They don't say Pope Francis as apparently blessed JC go.

1205
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,780
I'll let you guess what JC stands for.

1206
00:56:55,780 --> 00:57:01,360
Uh, apparently, uh, this was a game that was made in preparation for world youth day 2019.

1207
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:06,680
That is a Catholic youth event that will be happening in Panama up in January.

1208
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:12,020
Um, obviously you would not be throwing little balls at saints and Catholics and stuff to

1209
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:15,640
capture them, uh, to enslave them in the ball to do your bidding.

1210
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,640
So it's a little bit different.

1211
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:21,680
So what happens is that they join your evangelization team.

1212
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,760
If you can answer questions about the Bible, that's right.

1213
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,880
It's a Bible quiz game.

1214
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:32,080
So talk about edutainment games.

1215
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,120
I remember the years.

1216
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,640
People don't know this, but I went to church for several years and I used to be pretty

1217
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:38,640
good at them.

1218
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,640
Bible quizzes.

1219
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,640
I used to be able to recite the books.

1220
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,640
You know what?

1221
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,640
What?

1222
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,640
I did Bible drill.

1223
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:48,960
Did you, what's Bible drill where like you have to memorize whole passages and Oh wow.

1224
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,680
Find anything in the Bible and you know, be able to do, you know, they give you one book

1225
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,320
you have to see what's before and what's after and it was stupid.

1226
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:02,600
I gotta be honest, like, but I won like third place in one.

1227
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:07,000
Like anytime I hear about these, like, you know, and maybe just because I'm not religious,

1228
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,280
but like it just seems so forced.

1229
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,320
You mean, and it's always like a knockoff of something.

1230
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:17,640
It's like, I don't have a problem with you creating like edutainment.

1231
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:20,120
That's you know, original.

1232
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:23,240
That's you know, religious based, but like stop knocking shit off.

1233
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:27,520
Like I remember when I was dating someone that was going to tell that to the Pope.

1234
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,520
Stop knocking shit off.

1235
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,520
Yes.

1236
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,760
I am going to tell them to tell them, it's like, dude, fucking come up with your own

1237
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,760
original shit.

1238
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,760
You know what?

1239
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,760
Seriously.

1240
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:40,200
Um, no, I, I used to like date someone that was like really, really just stop touching

1241
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,200
little boys.

1242
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:46,160
And, and I remember going to her church group and they would like, they would quote unquote

1243
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,160
jam and shit.

1244
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:50,840
And they would just like come up with like these religious lyrics to fucking just like

1245
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,640
normal songs.

1246
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,680
Like, you know, like they were being alternate.

1247
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,680
Yeah.

1248
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,720
Basically like the, you know, they were doing alternative lyrics to, you know, um, my name

1249
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:04,920
is, you know, like, you know, they were, you know, my name is Jesus.

1250
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,920
Yeah, I know.

1251
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,920
I don't.

1252
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,920
Yeah.

1253
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,240
It's just like, I'm like, it's so cringy.

1254
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,240
It's just cringy.

1255
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,240
Awful.

1256
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,840
It makes me think of that comment that was said earlier about the edutainment games that

1257
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,720
there's a lot of kids that kind of see right through it.

1258
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,720
You know?

1259
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,660
Just don't like, I get it.

1260
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,560
It's popular, but you know what?

1261
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:28,080
Come up with something original and not just like fucking knock it off.

1262
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:32,520
Like come up with something that is unique.

1263
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:36,700
So you, what you would like, what, what if, what if they were to rip off like street fighter?

1264
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:42,320
What if there was like, you know, seen that though, I really, they had a Jesus game that

1265
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:48,160
is street fighter like types of, it's all these different religious deities.

1266
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,480
The Pope didn't like that one.

1267
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:54,120
And Santa Claus is in there too, because of course, but it is all these religious deities

1268
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,120
fighting each other.

1269
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:58,960
So they do have that already, but I mean, that's not supposed to be taken seriously

1270
00:59:58,960 --> 00:59:59,960
at all.

1271
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,520
It's just, it's silly, but.

1272
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,640
And I don't think the Pope is a fan of that one.

1273
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:11,280
I just, I'm sorry, just, it seems very, out of all the religions that I've had contact

1274
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,000
with in, in my lifetime, I feel that like Christianity, and maybe it's not Christianity,

1275
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,240
I'm just bundling all of like those religions as Christianity.

1276
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,600
So I'm not going to like Lutheran.

1277
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,920
I fucking don't know Catholic, it's all fucking Christianity to me.

1278
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:26,920
Dominations thereof.

1279
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:27,920
Yes, whatever.

1280
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,960
I am ignorant.

1281
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:30,960
That is it.

1282
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,960
I am ignorant.

1283
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,280
Can someone just clip that?

1284
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,280
I am ignorant.

1285
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,280
Can someone just clip that?

1286
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,280
I am ignorant to your religions.

1287
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,080
Can I play that on a future show?

1288
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:43,560
Out of all of the religions that I have had exposure to, Christianity is the only one

1289
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,280
that's trying to like actively recruit you into, it's like trying to fucking save you

1290
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,380
and it's irritating as shit to me.

1291
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:53,400
Like get it, you're happy with your religion, cool.

1292
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,400
It's funny.

1293
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,400
You know, it's funny.

1294
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,680
And I don't want to get into the religion debate too far, we've already gone far enough.

1295
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,680
Not all religions do that.

1296
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:03,840
I know, I know of at least one that you have to ask several times to be a part of it.

1297
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:08,040
So like, I'm, I'm cool with, if you're happy with it, cool.

1298
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,240
That that's your cup of tea, not my cup of tea.

1299
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:15,640
I'm not hating you for, but dude, it's just, it seems so forced and this is just seems

1300
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,640
kind of forced as well.

1301
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,960
It's like, come up with something different.

1302
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,840
If you can make a fun game and also teach religion at the same time, more power to you.

1303
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:24,840
Same thing.

1304
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:28,400
Like if you can make a game that's fun, that teaches you about fucking Oregon Trail, like

1305
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:34,560
if that, that game wasn't out, we probably know shit about, you know, there was, okay.

1306
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:38,800
You know, I will say there was a game I used to play at the mine shaft, the arcade years

1307
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:39,800
ago.

1308
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,760
And they had, because you know, that place was like secretly like a Mormon stronghold,

1309
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,280
you know, the, the mine shaft.

1310
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,720
So they actually had upstairs, they had a couple of games and one of them was Noah's

1311
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:53,960
Ark and in this Noah's Ark game, you were trying to pair up animals and take them on

1312
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:54,960
the Ark.

1313
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,880
And I actually played this game cause I thought it was fun.

1314
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:57,880
It was a fun game.

1315
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,880
Exactly.

1316
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,120
That's how you get people interested in stuff.

1317
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,440
Not just like, whatever, you know what?

1318
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,440
It's fine.

1319
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,440
It's not for me.

1320
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,520
I, why am I complaining about a game that's not for me?

1321
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,520
As you always do.

1322
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,040
It's like me complaining about sports games.

1323
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:15,200
I mean, anybody that's getting a little nerve to buy some of your religious discussion,

1324
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,760
you would, you would treat any game like this really.

1325
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,000
I don't get it.

1326
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
It's fine.

1327
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,280
I just, and this is any game that's like trying this shit.

1328
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,280
That's any game.

1329
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:28,240
Like even like the Jurassic parks, I was like, really, really lost world, really, really

1330
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,240
Ghostbusters.

1331
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:32,740
You fucking need to make a goddamn, you know, Pokemon go clone.

1332
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:37,900
Just fucking come up with some of the original, Ingress is different than Pokemon go.

1333
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:41,300
They're both AR games, but they're played completely fucking different.

1334
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:46,460
But everybody, because Pokemon goes popular, everything's gotta be catching some bullshit

1335
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:49,380
and like training it and trading and bull.

1336
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:53,720
It's just fucking Pokemon go make a different AR game.

1337
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:57,300
And that's why I'm kind of excited for Harry Potter, because since Niantic's involved there

1338
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:03,160
too, it's going to likely be a different game than Ingress prime, which we have to kind

1339
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:05,900
of say Ingress prime now, because that's starting to roll out.

1340
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:10,940
A lot of my friends are playing Ingress prime now, uh, that's because that's the scanner

1341
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:12,780
that's going to replace Ingress in November.

1342
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:17,260
But anyway, uh, Ingress prime and, um, uh, Pokemon go, Harry Potter is sure to be different.

1343
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,540
I'm really excited about it.

1344
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:20,740
So yeah, that'll be neat.

1345
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:26,740
That'll try because I, you know, I like their track record, buggish fucking shit.

1346
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:27,740
Oh yeah.

1347
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:28,740
Speaking of Niantic.

1348
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:29,740
Oh boy.

1349
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:34,980
You know, so I saw that they have that update now where it's going to be tracking your,

1350
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:38,940
you know, basically doing what it's supposed to be doing, which is coming up later in the

1351
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:39,940
show.

1352
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:40,940
So watch what you say.

1353
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:46,020
But like to that I had to laugh because like I use, you know, a gotcha or whatever and

1354
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:50,260
I keep the app, I just keep my phone like asleep as I'm doing that.

1355
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:53,660
And that app crashes so fucking often in my pocket.

1356
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:55,420
It's just like, really?

1357
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:58,360
You're going to, you're going to be tracking this in the background because fucking your

1358
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,940
app cannot stay open for like more than five minutes anyways.

1359
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:04,220
Well, I think there's a way it may still work.

1360
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:07,300
We'll talk a little more about that later in the show when we get to that.

1361
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:08,300
So all right.

1362
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:11,020
But for now, let's go to another story from Dark Sakura.

1363
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:12,540
Yeah.

1364
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:22,320
So at any rate, there is a few actually interesting things going on in the print world.

1365
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:26,060
First of all, we all know what Raspberry Pi is, right?

1366
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:27,060
Delicious.

1367
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:28,060
Yes.

1368
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:31,980
A delicious tiny little thing for your TV that's basically a computer.

1369
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:32,980
Yeah.

1370
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:36,740
That is a tiny computer to make it easier to get into computing.

1371
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:43,100
Well, they are doing a magazine dedicated to video game development and video gaming

1372
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:45,260
called Wireframe.

1373
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:50,700
And even better, they're giving away 10,000 free copies of the first edition if you register

1374
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,540
on their website.

1375
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:59,580
I put in for it, by the way, it's two pound shipping to the U.S. from the U.K.

1376
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:06,940
But it's also going to be, you know, money that's used to buy the print version will

1377
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:12,780
go back in to keep the Raspberry Pi foundation going so that they can keep making low cost

1378
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:14,760
computers for people.

1379
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:19,740
They also own other publications, including the Mag Pi and Hack Space magazine, which

1380
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:23,940
is under Raspberry Pi Press.

1381
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:26,740
But Wireframe itself is going to be more indie focused.

1382
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:28,340
So that will be really good.

1383
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:34,640
They actually have things like mods, early access games, development tools, all kinds

1384
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,640
of neat stuff.

1385
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:41,900
So I did actually decide it would be worth it to get in a little bit on this and ordered

1386
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:46,860
the first issue, which will go on sale officially on November 8th, 2018.

1387
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:52,300
And we'll have an interview with the creative director for Assassin's Creed 3 and Far Cry

1388
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,820
4, Alex Hutchinson.

1389
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:55,500
So we'll see.

1390
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,500
Nice.

1391
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:02,300
I need to get me one of these things and, you know, for science, for science, absolutely.

1392
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:05,380
I bet a Raspberry Pi would probably be more powerful than the computer we're using now

1393
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:06,380
to do O.L.R.

1394
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:07,380
You want to know what?

1395
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,540
Can a Raspberry Pi run Windows 10?

1396
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:12,020
That's probably true.

1397
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:13,760
You and I need to talk.

1398
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,760
Do we?

1399
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,860
But we always talk.

1400
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:20,220
We need to repeat a conversation that we've had.

1401
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:21,220
All right.

1402
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:22,220
Let's move on.

1403
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:24,420
A few more stories where we get to the classic game of the week.

1404
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:25,420
Loki.

1405
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:32,560
Apparently, with the release of Soul Calibur 6, there's been, you know, some shenanigans

1406
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:35,300
being done with the create a character mode.

1407
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:41,180
So apparently, I really I guess you can take these creative characters, the custom characters

1408
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:45,020
online and actually play ranked matches with them, which is a little weird.

1409
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:47,220
Yeah, I think I think that is the thing you can do.

1410
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,340
And so you imagine it.

1411
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:54,140
Someone's done it, you know, took like five seconds for someone to do Bowsette in Soul

1412
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:55,140
Calibur 6.

1413
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:59,340
So now there's these troll characters that appear online because what they're doing is

1414
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:03,260
they're using the create a character mode on PC and, of course, using a cheat engine

1415
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:09,980
or something like that to be able to go beyond the bounds of what is available on those sliders,

1416
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:13,180
which I'm glad that they have no anti-sanity check.

1417
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:16,460
Thanks a lot, Namco Bandai.

1418
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:22,520
But so now you have things like this dude that's in a giant cube or basically the cube

1419
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,520
that they're fighting.

1420
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,400
You can't see the person in the cube.

1421
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,400
You see this giant cube.

1422
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,280
So it's hard to judge where the person is to play that.

1423
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,240
So they've done that.

1424
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:37,960
And also, I guess the guy that was behind it, Abok, he was also showing off how you

1425
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:38,960
can do this yourself.

1426
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,800
So he made a giant apple as well.

1427
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:45,360
And then there's a nice little picture that I saw with someone that made a giant dick

1428
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:49,080
because the TTP in anything is immediately.

1429
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,080
Yes.

1430
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,840
And Red Dead Redemption also saw a picture because of the wonderful snow physics that

1431
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,960
they have that you can walk and you can see the trail.

1432
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,880
Someone also walked in the shape of a penis.

1433
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:58,880
You don't say.

1434
01:07:58,880 --> 01:07:59,880
Yes.

1435
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:00,880
You don't say.

1436
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:04,760
Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Bob Coffey says lizard dongs are a big problem

1437
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:05,920
in Soul Calibur 6.

1438
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,040
I don't even know if that's a joke or a true statement.

1439
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,360
It's got to be a true statement.

1440
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:16,840
But yeah, so it's kind of weird, though, that I'm assuming this is going to get patched

1441
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:17,840
out.

1442
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,240
They've got to put some sort of sanity checks in there.

1443
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:23,000
You know, hey, you know, is this between this and this value?

1444
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,880
If not, you know, flag this or whatever.

1445
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,720
I'm surprised that that's not a thing.

1446
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:33,760
But that's as I like to call it at work, MVP, Minimal Viable Product.

1447
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:36,600
All right.

1448
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,340
Let's talk about something else that is probably like the minimum of what they can offer because

1449
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:43,640
there's going to be a lot of problems with this, I think, and that is the PlayStation

1450
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,800
name change feature.

1451
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:49,320
As we have already discussed, the name change feature probably isn't going to work with

1452
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:52,940
a lot of old PlayStation games because it's only going to be guaranteed to work with games

1453
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:55,200
after a certain date or beyond.

1454
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:59,200
And even then, apparently, some of the beta testers are learning that name changes may

1455
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:04,440
actually make you lose access to content like paid DLC for your games.

1456
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,960
Things like leaderboard data, progress towards trophies.

1457
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:08,960
Not all the time.

1458
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,760
I want to stress, not all the time.

1459
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:14,040
But in some cases, this is getting messed up.

1460
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:18,520
Why are we implementing a feature that breaks things like I don't want it?

1461
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,520
It is a beta.

1462
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,520
Let's be fair.

1463
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,520
Betas.

1464
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:26,480
When we test these things that come to light in the hopes that Sony will fix them.

1465
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,680
But it's not looking good so far.

1466
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:33,300
Like honestly, y'all just probably want to keep the names you've got right now.

1467
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:37,200
Maybe wait for PlayStation five before you start making some big change.

1468
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,560
I got to say, honestly, like fuck that.

1469
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:43,680
I mean, like, I'll just wait for the next fucking Microsoft console to be honest.

1470
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,880
This is ridiculous.

1471
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,600
Bobby Blackwolf in chat suggests, even if it's broken, just give me the option.

1472
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,920
Some people want to change their name that badly.

1473
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,800
Even if it's broken, give me the option.

1474
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,760
I'm not changing my name, so I'm good.

1475
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,760
Yeah, I know.

1476
01:09:58,760 --> 01:09:59,760
I'm in a weird place.

1477
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,600
It's like, I'm not really interested in changing my name.

1478
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,480
Like I'm not like Rob Roberts on PlayStation, but that's what I'm like.

1479
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,480
I'm okay with that.

1480
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:06,480
It's fine.

1481
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:12,880
Plus PlayStation allows you to link to Facebook and like, you know, if we're going to be PlayStation

1482
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,360
friends, we're probably Facebook friends.

1483
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,080
And that's a really good way to find people.

1484
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:23,680
So like I kind of the names don't really matter when you have that sort of integration, but

1485
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:27,680
that's just at least my, I don't know, my thing.

1486
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,920
All right.

1487
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:29,920
Interesting.

1488
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:34,840
We have a user in our chat at live.vognetwork.com named Protect the Second who says, it's so

1489
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:39,640
funny because I made my PlayStation network the same I have on this IRC and they made

1490
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,640
me change it.

1491
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,020
It changed no problem.

1492
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:44,940
So weird that this has taken so long to make a feature.

1493
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:47,180
So if they don't like your name, you can change it easily.

1494
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:52,220
Well, that is an interesting counterpoint is that if they force you to do a name change

1495
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:58,200
because you know, you have something in your name that either you, you get a name clash

1496
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:01,060
with a famous person that wants like, you can't name yourself Lady Gaga.

1497
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:05,460
So if Lady Gaga wants that name, she gets it, uh, whether you like it or not, uh, or

1498
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:09,020
something that is quote unquote offensive.

1499
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:14,500
I'm not, oh, cause her name is really Stephanie.

1500
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:15,500
I see what she did there.

1501
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:20,660
I go, she's so I'd be pissed if that was the case, honestly, like, you know, Oh, well,

1502
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:21,660
I'm sorry.

1503
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:22,660
I want this thing.

1504
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:24,940
Well, no, no, but it's weird that they could force you to change it.

1505
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:25,940
It doesn't have any problems.

1506
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:31,660
If I was Lady Gaga, like back when, you know, the PS3 came out or whatever like that.

1507
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:35,060
And then for whatever reason, she decided to get in the game and wanted to be called

1508
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:36,060
Lady Gaga.

1509
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:37,060
They would just, okay.

1510
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:39,940
I know this is a hypothetical situation, but like, I'd be fucking pissed.

1511
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:41,780
Let's say you have like an offensive name.

1512
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:46,140
Like let's say you took your hatred of JC go too far and you made a handle on PlayStation

1513
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:47,140
network.

1514
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:48,140
JC go to hell.

1515
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:49,140
Yeah.

1516
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:50,140
Okay.

1517
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:51,140
You made it.

1518
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,280
You made JC go to hell and somebody's going to say, you know what?

1519
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:57,400
Go to hell is not a nice thing to say on PlayStation network when kids could be on it playing Minecraft.

1520
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:01,840
So they're going to force you to change your name away from JC go to hell so they can force

1521
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,720
you to change your name and it works fine apparently.

1522
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,320
So why doesn't it work in this case?

1523
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,320
It's weird.

1524
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,320
It's very strange.

1525
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:14,820
Anyway, uh, Bobby Black Wolf suggests they probably have a complicated manual system

1526
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:18,920
that they can do behind the scenes to allow the forced name change, which is not something

1527
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:22,920
they can replicate in an automatic way that is consumer facing.

1528
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:26,320
It all goes back to the whole, they made a bad design.

1529
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,600
So all right.

1530
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:34,280
D'artistsuya in chat says along those lines to what Rob was saying over on Nintendo, I

1531
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,720
found a Miss Vangie on Splatoon 2.

1532
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,720
She even added me.

1533
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:43,920
Though I don't know if it's just a fan or what, uh, video games, drag queen, likely

1534
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,920
OLR listener.

1535
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:45,920
Yes.

1536
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,920
I don't know.

1537
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,880
Dark Sakura is your, is your Nintendo name?

1538
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:51,880
Miss Vangie?

1539
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:52,880
No.

1540
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,480
I don't think it's just Dark Sakura.

1541
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:56,880
All right.

1542
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,720
Anyway, uh, let's move on.

1543
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,200
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us next in the news?

1544
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,960
The library of Congress.

1545
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,360
Oh, the library is open.

1546
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,360
Yeah.

1547
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,440
I'll read something about the government.

1548
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:09,440
No.

1549
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:15,040
Um, anyway, uh, the library of Congress in the US Copyright Office revised its list of

1550
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:20,240
specific exceptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the DMCA.

1551
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:28,560
Um, it now has expanded, um, the ability to revive and protect older games as well as

1552
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:36,560
DIY repairs to systems to break DRM to fix the hardware.

1553
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:42,160
Basically, um, it's, it's all in the name of preserving old games.

1554
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:48,120
In fact, um, they gave libraries and archives as well as museums their right to circumvent

1555
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:52,720
DRM so that video games can be preserved in playable condition.

1556
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:57,200
And so this year's list actually reaffirmed and expanded that a little bit.

1557
01:13:57,240 --> 01:14:03,080
So, um, an additional section there actually calls out instances where online authentication

1558
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:05,440
is required in order to play games.

1559
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:10,200
Um, once a copyright holder shuts down authentication services, consumers now have the right to

1560
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:13,320
break DRM in order to play games.

1561
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:18,640
So yes, you can copy that floppy in order to play a game that can no longer validate

1562
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,440
you online.

1563
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,760
And I know this was a big, um, kind of back and forth in the gaming industry.

1564
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,160
Uh, just not that long ago.

1565
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,320
So we were talking about, you know, servers coming down and so forth.

1566
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,720
So this is a pretty big deal.

1567
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:33,000
Well, it goes into effect as of today.

1568
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,000
So huzzah, I'm sure there are going to be some court challenges coming up.

1569
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:42,720
I'd really like to see how it pans out, but for right now, do the thing.

1570
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:47,160
You can copy that floppy all you want in this context and this context only.

1571
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,280
Break that DRM for preservation.

1572
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,280
Not the new stuff.

1573
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:51,280
So, all right.

1574
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:54,440
Only when the servers get taken offline, which, um,

1575
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:55,440
Final Fantasy 11.

1576
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,440
Woo!

1577
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:57,440
Yeah.

1578
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:58,440
Right.

1579
01:14:58,440 --> 01:14:59,440
And some other games too, right?

1580
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,440
Logie?

1581
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:01,440
Yes.

1582
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,440
Other games like Warhawk on PS3.

1583
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:07,560
Apparently there's a couple of people that are up in arms about the fact that it was

1584
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:12,200
announced that they would be shutting down their servers on October 25th as opposed to

1585
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:16,680
the 90 day window that they're supposed to give us according to the back of the box.

1586
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:22,680
Um, previous games that they did shut down like recently at, well, not so recent, SOCOM,

1587
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:27,600
they shut down their servers August 31st, 2012, and they did announce that 90 days

1588
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,160
in advance, but Warhawk, not so much.

1589
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:35,240
I got to wonder how many people are actually playing Warhawk, so, uh, but another one bites

1590
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:39,800
the dust, but I'm guessing that there was really no one playing that game.

1591
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:42,560
Maybe that's why I didn't do notice.

1592
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:47,960
Yeah, I'm guessing a lot of these games probably aren't super trafficked anyway, but you never

1593
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:48,960
know.

1594
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:49,960
Yeah.

1595
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,600
I'm sure it made somebody angry enough to write an article about it.

1596
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:58,000
Uh, Destiny 100 Matt, uh, eulogizing a bit, says Warhawk was a fun game at its time.

1597
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,880
Well, hey, you know, thanks to this Library of Congress decision, you can bring it back.

1598
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,720
Well, I mean, this is, you know, it's funny though with the Warhawk thing is like, they

1599
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:07,720
could bring it back.

1600
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:11,280
They just put it as part of like a PlayStation Now thing and then you can play it online

1601
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,280
still.

1602
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:14,480
I guess they probably just don't make enough money to run those servers.

1603
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,520
It's not beneficial for them.

1604
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:17,520
All right.

1605
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:21,840
Uh, let's see, let's talk about Dreamcast games coming to the Switch.

1606
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:22,840
Yep, that's right.

1607
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:26,520
You might get to relive your favorite Dreamcast classics all over again.

1608
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:32,240
This coming from a recent, uh, talk with Famitsu where Naoki Horii from Sega talked about how

1609
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:38,160
the Switch was getting very close to successfully running the Dreamcast titles, uh, via emulation,

1610
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,160
which would not be surprising.

1611
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:40,160
They were doing it on PC.

1612
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,880
They invented it on other consoles.

1613
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,360
So why not the Switch as well?

1614
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:47,340
So they could theoretically remake or port certain Dreamcast games.

1615
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:48,340
So sure.

1616
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:49,340
Why not?

1617
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:50,640
Space Channel Five all over again.

1618
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,700
Crazy Taxi.

1619
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:52,700
Why not?

1620
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:53,700
But you know what?

1621
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:56,640
Where's the, I mean, I know it's not a Sega game, but like when I think of Dreamcast,

1622
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:57,640
I think of Power Stone.

1623
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:02,320
I was just going to say like, it's not a Dreamcast game, but like Power Stone, please.

1624
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,480
The best we got was PSP I think had a Power Stone.

1625
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:11,240
It was PSP or Vida got a Power Stone collection of one and two, I believe.

1626
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:12,240
I think it was PS.

1627
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:15,160
No, it must have been Vida.

1628
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:20,640
I don't think PSP would have had Power Stone, but it was one of the Sony portable systems

1629
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,240
that got that.

1630
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:26,200
Um, but yeah, I, I would love a new Power Stone game.

1631
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,920
It would be awesome.

1632
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,000
Or even some of those characters coming over to like a Street Fighter game or something

1633
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
like that.

1634
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Yeah.

1635
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
At least, uh, at least it would be nice if somebody would like take the concept, but

1636
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,720
I guess, um, they are, uh, it was PSP.

1637
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:40,720
Okay.

1638
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:44,080
I guess Capcom is talking about bringing some of their old stuff back, kind of.

1639
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,160
They had a tweet about it this week.

1640
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:52,040
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf suggests Seaman HD, a popular Dreamcast game that always comes up

1641
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,040
on OLR.

1642
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,040
That is supposed to be coming.

1643
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,040
There's supposed to be a new Seaman coming.

1644
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,200
I thought there would, they're working on a new Seaman.

1645
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:03,400
So whenever that happens, didn't they, was it like a Kickstarter or something?

1646
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,920
I thought that they were doing that.

1647
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:05,920
Yeah.

1648
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,020
I thought I remember that being a thing that we talked about earlier too.

1649
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:14,180
So orange right suggests considering that Parappa port essentially ran on a PSP emulator

1650
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:16,580
and apparently Castlevania might be a similar situation.

1651
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,620
I can see Capcom releasing Power Stone on PlayStation four.

1652
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:21,500
You just, you just need to scream.

1653
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:24,260
You need to passively, aggressively tweet Capcom enough.

1654
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:25,260
No, I'm just kidding.

1655
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:28,740
Be respectful, but you know, let them know, let them know the demand is out there.

1656
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:29,960
So all right.

1657
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:33,640
And yeah, dark to see you confirming what I saw on Twitter, uh, Capcom's confirmed that

1658
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:37,380
they're putting Resident Evil zero, Resident Evil four on switch.

1659
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:41,300
So you get to buy Resident Evil four again, but I mean, it was a really good, like it's

1660
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,940
probably like the best Resident Evil game.

1661
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:43,940
So Power Stone instead.

1662
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:44,940
Yeah.

1663
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:45,940
I'd like to see some Power Stone.

1664
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:49,660
I'd even like take Tatsunoko versus Capcom, but I don't think that's going to happen.

1665
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:50,660
Oh man.

1666
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:53,180
I would love them to bring that out on, on the switch.

1667
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:55,660
Now I'd imagine the licensing issues are gonna make that a challenge.

1668
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:58,340
So I don't know about that, but you can still play that in some arcades.

1669
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:00,660
I know round one in a Concord has it.

1670
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:02,900
So I almost stopped at round one in San Jose.

1671
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:08,300
I was so tempted, but I was like, I can't stand being in this car any longer than half

1672
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:09,300
there.

1673
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:10,300
And the kids have whined.

1674
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:11,300
Yeah.

1675
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:12,300
I play ticket games.

1676
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:13,300
Yeah.

1677
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:14,300
I'll play the crane.

1678
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:15,300
I'll play dancer.

1679
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,300
She doesn't want to play a game with the answer.

1680
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:18,300
No ticket games.

1681
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:25,860
It was like, uh, all right, uh, let's take a trip down memory lane to the classic game

1682
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,260
of the week.

1683
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:30,580
Not Power Stone tonight, but another goodie because every week dark soccer gets into the

1684
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:34,340
gaming vault and usually we have to rely on radio magic to make it happen.

1685
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:39,460
But she's here in person for this very special 750th episode of orange launch radio to pick

1686
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:44,660
a game that she thinks, Hey, brats, you should be respecting this game.

1687
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:47,420
And honestly though, this is a game everybody already respects.

1688
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:54,100
I think like, I don't know people that don't not like this game unless they just dislike

1689
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:55,100
this genre.

1690
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:57,900
If they dislike this genre, then they probably don't care for this game.

1691
01:19:57,900 --> 01:19:59,740
But if you're into this genre, you like this game.

1692
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:01,140
Anyway, I'll stop yapping.

1693
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:05,840
What is the classic game of the week dark saga versus street fighter, which, no, I haven't

1694
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:06,840
done it before.

1695
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:07,840
I checked the Wiki.

1696
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:12,940
So X-Men versus street fighter, um, it is a fighting game.

1697
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:21,820
It is the big one that started the versus saga that came out in Japan in September 1996.

1698
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:28,860
And um, it had several different home releases, the best of course being on the sake of Saturn.

1699
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:35,500
Um, it basically had, it was actually, I kind of look at it as a direct result of X-Men

1700
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,020
children of the Adam.

1701
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:41,540
So it had the characters from X-Men battling street fighter characters.

1702
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:48,860
Um, it was, uh, honestly a very unique game cause I mean you had, what else was the only

1703
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:51,860
thing out like it at the time was king of fighters.

1704
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:57,340
And, but this one was definitely like a combining of, of different genres.

1705
01:20:57,340 --> 01:20:59,340
It was pretty cool.

1706
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:05,500
Um, it was pretty positively received and it also gave way to the sequel Marvel superheroes

1707
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:08,460
versus street fighter that came out the next year.

1708
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:11,660
So with this one, it is a 2D fighting game.

1709
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:13,960
You have all kinds of different characters.

1710
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:19,900
It is the first formal installment of the Marvel versus Capcom series.

1711
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,380
So this, this isn't started the whole thing.

1712
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:26,780
Um, you start off with, you know, each character has their own life gauge and you switch between

1713
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:31,220
each character so that you can have some people refill their life bar in the back end.

1714
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:38,060
Um, you know, you had assist moves and hyper combos and variable counters and fun stuff

1715
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,620
like that.

1716
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:45,900
Um, you also had, um, your arcade mode where you do a story against an AI and you have

1717
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:46,900
your versus mode.

1718
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:53,460
Um, if you do the story mode, then after you beat apocalypse, you actually fight your partner.

1719
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:55,740
You're left with whoever you beat the boss with.

1720
01:21:55,740 --> 01:22:00,140
Um, and then you get an ending for that one.

1721
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:07,740
So the characters that were in this one, um, were, uh, Cyclops, Gambit, Juggernaut, Magneto,

1722
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:10,780
Rogue, Sabretooth, Storm and Wolverine.

1723
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:18,100
And then for the, uh, street fighter characters, Akuma or Golki as he was in Japan, Kami, Charlie,

1724
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:26,780
um, Chun-Li, Dalsim, Ken, Bison, oh well, or Balrog I guess as he was, uh, not Balrog.

1725
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:29,780
Who was it?

1726
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:30,780
Vega, that was it.

1727
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:31,780
Vega.

1728
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:32,780
They were all so many bad people.

1729
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:43,020
Uh, Ryu and Zangief, so, um, the game was, uh, released on, uh, for CPS2 arcade board

1730
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:51,260
and, um, it had a direct port to Sega Saturn that was, uh, released with the 4MB RAM cart.

1731
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:55,060
This did not come out in the U.S. because they didn't know shit about marketing Saturn

1732
01:22:55,060 --> 01:23:01,300
in the U.S., um, but they were selling it at EB in the U.S.

1733
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:05,420
Um, Sega had plans to release it in Europe, um, that had it bundled with the expansion

1734
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:09,620
cartridges, but they eventually put that to the side.

1735
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:17,300
I said, um, that it was going to be exclusive to the Saturn and then, um, because, uh, Capcom

1736
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:21,300
was accused of favoritism to the Saturn, but even though the Saturn versions of Street

1737
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:28,700
Fighter Alpha 2 were better and the home version of, uh, Night Warriors was a Saturn exclusive

1738
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:33,460
as well, Capcom pulled back on that and said that they would do a PlayStation version,

1739
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:37,540
which was, of course, nowhere near arcade perfect.

1740
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:41,860
Um, it was pretty terrible, actually.

1741
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:47,100
It was missing animation, it had no versus mode, um, you know, because of the memory

1742
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:54,740
limitations of the, um, the PlayStation, of course, there was no real, like, supported

1743
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:57,460
RAM, uh, cart, you know.

1744
01:23:57,460 --> 01:24:01,020
I was assuming that they would have something that would have fit into that I.O. port in

1745
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:06,100
the back, but that never happened and, of course, you know that, um, later models never

1746
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:09,140
had, they removed all those extra ports in the back.

1747
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:13,140
Which, by the way, I found the first gen PlayStation at a first gen the other day.

1748
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:17,140
I didn't get it because I already have, like, three of them.

1749
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:25,020
Um, but the game was positively received, um, it was really fun except, of course, the

1750
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:31,260
PlayStation 1 was pretty much, you know, kicked in the ass for being terrible, um, and then,

1751
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:35,260
of course, it led to the sequel, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, which then led

1752
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:43,260
to, you know, Marvel vs. Capcom series, Marvel vs. SNK, Capcom vs. SNK, Tatsu no Ko vs. Capcom.

1753
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:48,940
We have more and more of these versus series, uh, coming out that just took everything we

1754
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:51,460
loved and made it awesome.

1755
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:55,260
Except for what the fuck is up with putting that comedian in Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street

1756
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:57,260
Fighter, that's stupid.

1757
01:24:57,260 --> 01:24:58,260
Norimaru.

1758
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:59,260
I'm done.

1759
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:05,260
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, a classic fighter for sure.

1760
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:08,260
X-Men vs. Street Fighter.

1761
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:12,260
Good pick for a landmark episode of Orange Lounge Radio, good, uh, fighting game selection.

1762
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:13,260
Yes.

1763
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:17,260
Alright, we're gonna take a quick break, but when we come back, there is plenty more Orange

1764
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:20,260
Lounge Radio to come, including more rapid fire news.

1765
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:24,260
We're gonna get to, uh, your emails, or emails as the case may be, and we'll get to your

1766
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:27,260
calls, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1767
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:31,260
When we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1768
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:41,260
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight with episode number 750

1769
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:43,260
of our show already in progress.

1770
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:47,260
Um, I know you guys love all the Pokémon GO updates, but I do have to say, so during

1771
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:53,260
the break, uh, I traded that unknown to Loki, and, uh, I said, just give me anything that

1772
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:56,260
I won't be upset if it went lucky, and he gave me a Magikarp.

1773
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:57,260
Guess what happened?

1774
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:58,260
Lucky trade.

1775
01:25:58,260 --> 01:25:59,260
Of course, yeah.

1776
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:03,260
So now I have a lucky Magikarp, which obviously will become a Gyarados when I have the candy,

1777
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:04,260
and, um...

1778
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:06,260
Apparently, Gastly's turned into Diddos now.

1779
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:07,260
Oh, do, oh, can they?

1780
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:08,260
Oh, is the one on my house a Ditto?

1781
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:09,260
Yeah, the one is a Ditto, yeah.

1782
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:10,260
Oh, funny.

1783
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:13,260
And then, uh, but you got a lucky unknown, which not a lot of people have, so there you

1784
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:14,260
go.

1785
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:15,260
Yep.

1786
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:16,260
That's fun.

1787
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:17,260
Alright.

1788
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:20,260
Anyway, uh, let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about, uh, some other quick

1789
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:24,260
things that have been happening this week while Mr. Smoosh is screaming in the other

1790
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:29,260
room, so I'm gonna see if some kibble will satiate his fat ass for a little while.

1791
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:30,260
Loki.

1792
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:31,260
Alright.

1793
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,260
Just bring him to me.

1794
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:34,260
I will comfort him.

1795
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:35,260
Alright.

1796
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:42,260
So, uh, Jade Raymond has left Electronic Arts, and she was, of course, the producer of the

1797
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:50,260
Assassin's Creed series before moving to EA's Motive Studio, uh, about three years ago,

1798
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:57,260
and, uh, she was originally gonna be overseeing a, I think it was that, uh, Star Wars, uh,

1799
01:26:57,260 --> 01:27:02,260
the single-player game, the kind of, uh, action-adventure game, but apparently they canceled that, so

1800
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:10,260
now, um, Motive is working on a new IP in Star Wars, um, project, but she is no longer

1801
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:15,260
gonna be working on that, because she has left the studio onto bigger and better things

1802
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:20,260
than whatever EA can churn out for a Star Wars game.

1803
01:27:20,260 --> 01:27:26,260
Um, and then, of course, for you, Soul Calibur 6 players, they'd be happy to know that Nier

1804
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:34,260
Automata's 2B is gonna be coming to Soul Calibur 6 as a, um, DLC character.

1805
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:36,260
So, that's pretty awesome.

1806
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:37,260
Alright.

1807
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:42,260
Uh, last week on the show, we spent some time talking about the Intellivision Amico, and

1808
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:46,260
we had mentioned that more information would be coming out on the Monday following our

1809
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:47,260
show, and that did happen.

1810
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:50,260
They did end up having a trailer, uh, that came out.

1811
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:54,260
Um, most of the trailer kind of recap things we already had known about, uh, although you

1812
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:58,260
did get to see some of the personalities that would be involved with the Intellivision.

1813
01:27:58,260 --> 01:27:59,260
A lot of people.

1814
01:27:59,260 --> 01:28:00,260
I didn't realize how many.

1815
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:03,260
Yeah, which the one that struck me as funny, which obviously, you know, going back way

1816
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:09,260
back throwback to our DDR days, but the guy that was, like, big with DDR's relations,

1817
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:13,260
I think it was, like, PR relations, and I don't remember what his official title was,

1818
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:16,260
but Jason Enos was kind of, out of Konami, he was, like, kind of like the face of DDR

1819
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:20,260
a little bit for a while, and he's going to be, it sounds like, what, like second in command

1820
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:22,260
on this Intellivision thing, isn't he?

1821
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:26,260
Yeah, and I remember, what was it, Dave Perry with, was it Shiny?

1822
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:32,260
He was in there as well, so, I mean, lots of people that are on board with this thing,

1823
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:33,260
so it has potential.

1824
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:35,260
I'm curious to see what happens with it.

1825
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:39,260
And Perrin Kaplan, who I think was involved with Nintendo for a short while, unfortunately,

1826
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:44,260
I think she was there during that whole Wii Vitality sensor debacle, but, not everything's

1827
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:46,260
a hit, it happens.

1828
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:51,260
So, anyway, Loki, would you mind grabbing this other thing I had, because unfortunately

1829
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:54,260
I'm not able to pull it up on this computer, it's having a problem.

1830
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:55,260
Oh, darn, that Windows XP.

1831
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:59,260
I know, right, but I know it has to do with Capcom's beat-em-up bundle, and it's getting

1832
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:00,260
a new patch that's coming out.

1833
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:06,260
Yeah, it's because their beat-em-up bundle was absolute dog shit on, I think it was PC,

1834
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:08,260
but apparently that's not the issue.

1835
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:12,260
It says they're going to be getting a patch that's coming in November, and it's going

1836
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:16,260
to be adding new screen filters, a new screen size, an option to turn off the ability for

1837
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:18,260
other players to join in-game sessions online.

1838
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:23,260
I guess that has nothing to do with just the absolute lag and bullshit that was in, I think,

1839
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:26,260
the PC version, or maybe in the Switch version.

1840
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:30,260
I just remember watching a video of it where it was stuttering like fucking crazy.

1841
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:32,260
But that's cool that they're supporting their games.

1842
01:29:32,260 --> 01:29:38,260
Hopefully whatever that issue was and whatever version it was that I saw a video of is fixed.

1843
01:29:38,260 --> 01:29:42,260
Alright, and Dark Sakura has a few stories for us before we get to releases around the

1844
01:29:42,260 --> 01:29:43,260
world.

1845
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:44,260
Ah, I do.

1846
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:47,260
Well, if I can make the words come out of my mouth.

1847
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:54,260
The next Splatfest in Japan, or Splatoon 2 Splatfest, I should say, is about Poki, as

1848
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:56,260
in the confection.

1849
01:29:56,260 --> 01:30:03,260
There is regular Poki, and there is Poki Extremely Thins, which are about the girth of a spaghetti

1850
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:04,260
strand.

1851
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:07,260
And some of us, you've probably heard it pronounced Poki.

1852
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:09,260
Some people pronounce it like that.

1853
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:11,260
Yeah, because I think of Poki as in like raw fish.

1854
01:30:11,260 --> 01:30:13,260
I think of the fish thing, yeah.

1855
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:14,260
That's Poki.

1856
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:16,260
I know, I know.

1857
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:17,260
But you know how we-

1858
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:20,260
But I'm a dumb American, so I don't understand the difference.

1859
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:21,260
Y'all need to speak American.

1860
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:25,260
Can I make spaghetti out of the Poki or whatever?

1861
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:30,260
Maybe Sp-Sp-Poki?

1862
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:34,260
So also, Team Sonic Racing has been delayed until next year.

1863
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:39,260
It's been pushed back to May 21st, 2019, and no one curr.

1864
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:45,260
I hope it's only to get the guy that did the theme song for Daytona to do the theme song

1865
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:46,260
for this game.

1866
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:48,260
I hope it's to get Danica Patrick back.

1867
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:50,260
Well, let's see, why not both?

1868
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:53,260
I really, actually, it's funny, have you ever watched that guy sing?

1869
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:54,260
Yeah.

1870
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:58,260
He's absolutely engaging to watch.

1871
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:02,260
Even like studio stuff, he's like, I'm totally into Brew Brew Sky.

1872
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:03,260
That's right.

1873
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:04,260
And he sang Burning Rangers.

1874
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:08,260
He had, didn't he team up for like F-Zero song?

1875
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:09,260
Yes, yes.

1876
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:11,260
I was like, he was just recently, we were talking about that guy.

1877
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:13,260
Yes, everything he touches is magic.

1878
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:14,260
Yeah.

1879
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:18,260
And SSG100Matt in our chat at live.vognetwork.com wants to point out, I care, Sonic All-Star

1880
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:19,260
Racing was great.

1881
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:23,260
I care too, but you know, you want it to be a good game.

1882
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:26,260
Every little thing he sings is magic.

1883
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:27,260
Right.

1884
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:30,260
Let's travel around the world and check out some upcoming releases.

1885
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:33,260
What you'll be buying a little sooner than Team Sonic Racing.

1886
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:34,260
Yes.

1890
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:50,260
Which I still have never played.

1891
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:51,260
Is that weird?

1892
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:53,260
I just haven't gotten around to that.

1893
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:55,260
Especially since you've cosplayed.

1894
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:56,260
I know, right?

1895
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:57,260
You haven't played the game yet.

1896
01:31:57,260 --> 01:31:58,260
Sorry to let you all down.

1897
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:01,260
I'm a fake, fake gamer boy.

1898
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:03,260
Fake gamer boy.

1899
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:05,260

Steven Universe Save the Light on the Switch.

1907
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:32,260
This one should be a little bit up Rob's alley.

1908
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:35,260
Diablo 3 The Eternal collection on the Switch this week.

1909
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:37,260
Yeah, I kind of want to get it.

1910
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:41,260
It's money, it's money, but I'm probably going to end up getting that anyway.

1911
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:43,260
And then for you music game fans,

1912
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:47,260
Taiko no Tatujin Drum and Fun on the Switch.

1913
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:48,260
And if you don't have a Switch,

1914
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:52,260
Taiko no Tatujin Drum Session on PlayStation 4.

1915
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:53,260
That's it.

1916
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:54,260
Nice.

1917
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:56,260
Japan feels a little light this week.

1918
01:32:56,260 --> 01:32:59,260
I'm not seeing huge releases, at least not on PlayStation 4.

1919
01:32:59,260 --> 01:33:02,260
Transference is the only really big release from Ubisoft

1920
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:05,260
on November 1st this week on the PlayStation 4.

1921
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:08,260
Over on the Nintendo Switch,

1922
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:11,260
I don't think I see anything big over there either actually.

1923
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:14,260
Niko Tomo is the only game that I see on the Switch this week.

1924
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:16,260
So it seems to be a quiet week on the Switch,

1925
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:18,260
or excuse me, a quiet week in Japan for whatever reason.

1926
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:20,260
Dark Sakura.

1927
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:22,260
It's busy over in Europe.

1928
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:25,260
So starting with the 30th,

1929
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:27,260
we have Fallout 76 Beta.

1930
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:31,260

8 To Glory Bull Riding.

1934
01:33:42,260 --> 01:33:43,260
Okay.

1935
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:46,260
Gungrave VR Loaded Coffin Edition.

1936
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:48,260
That's on the 31st.

1937
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:54,260
Galmetal World Tour Edition on the 31st on Switch.

1938
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:57,260
It looks like on November 2nd,

1939
01:33:57,260 --> 01:34:02,260
we have Football Manager 2019.

1940
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:05,260
We have Mutant Football League Dynasty Edition.

01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:11,260
Looks like Diablo 3 The Eternal Collection.

1943
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:14,260
Taiko no Tatsujin Drum and Fun.

1944
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:16,260
Jeez, Mushi.

1945
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:18,260
This was all during the show last week,

1946
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:20,260
so you just have to get used to it.

1947
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:23,260
Lego Harry Potter Collection for Xbox and Switch.

1948
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:26,260
Witcher 3 Dark Souls 3 Bundle.

1949
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:27,260
God, there's a bunch on this.

1950
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:28,260
Okay, here's the last one.

1951
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:30,260
And Gem Smashers.

1952
01:34:30,260 --> 01:34:31,260
There you go.

1953
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:33,260
All right.

1954
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:34,260
Well, let's move on.

1955
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:35,260
You know, everything I read about the cat meowing

1956
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:37,260
says you can't acknowledge it,

1957
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:40,260
because then it just teaches them that it works.

1958
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:41,260
It'll make it worse, yeah.

1959
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:42,260
It works, yeah.

1960
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:45,260
So, sucks, huh?

1961
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:47,260
I just feed Midna and she shuts up.

1962
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:49,260
No, I just fed this one.

1963
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:50,260
Anyway.

1964
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:52,260
I don't know, usually I just get Midna in my lap

1965
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:53,260
and she shuts up.

1966
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:56,260
SSG100Matt says Mr. Smoosh wants to do release dates.

1967
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:57,260
Maybe that's what it is.

1968
01:34:57,260 --> 01:34:58,260
Maybe Mr. Smoosh is coming for your...

1969
01:34:58,260 --> 01:35:00,260
He's gonna release his poop.

1970
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:03,260
As long as he does it in the litter box, fine.

1971
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:05,260
SSG100Matt suggests that Mr. Smoosh

1972
01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:08,260
gets Australian release dates.

1973
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:11,260
That might not be a bad idea.

1974
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:12,260
Coming out this week.

1975
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:13,260
Meow.

1976
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:14,260
And meow.

1977
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:15,260
Oh, good.

1978
01:35:15,260 --> 01:35:17,260
Other dad is home and can hopefully take care

1979
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:20,260
of Mr. Smoosh's insensitive meowing.

1980
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:21,260
All right, anyway.

1981
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:22,260
He's singing us the song of his people.

1982
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:23,260
That's right.

1983
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:24,260
All right.

1984
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:25,260
Let's move on to the mailbag,

1985
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:27,260
because every week you guys send us e-mails

1986
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:29,260
to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1987
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:32,260
I'm quite pleased with how clean the mailbox was.

1988
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:33,260
Yes.

1989
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:35,260
I... because I knew you would bellyache

1990
01:35:35,260 --> 01:35:37,260
if I didn't move everything to trash.

1991
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:38,260
Meow.

1992
01:35:38,260 --> 01:35:39,260
Meow.

1993
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:40,260
Exactly.

1994
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:41,260
Meow.

1995
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:42,260
Meow.

1996
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:43,260
See, I speak Smoosh.

1997
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:45,260
Uh, Darce Acro, what is in the mailbag?

1998
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:47,260
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

1999
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:48,260
is the e-mail address.

2000
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:50,260
From our own Raginator.

2001
01:35:50,260 --> 01:35:51,260
Hi, everyone.

2002
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:52,260
As opposed to someone else's.

2003
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:53,260
Someone else's Raginator.

2004
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:54,260
Sorry, Raginator.

2005
01:35:54,260 --> 01:35:55,260
We're giving you to someone else.

2006
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:56,260
You can't be ours anymore.

2007
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:57,260
Kidding.

2008
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:58,260
Hi, everyone.

2009
01:35:58,260 --> 01:36:00,260
Just writing this very last second e-mail

2010
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:02,260
to pose a long-winded question

2011
01:36:02,260 --> 01:36:04,260
that is arising from a shitstorm

2012
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:06,260
that occurred this weekend.

2013
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:08,260
I'm trying to help someone come up with ideas

2014
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:10,260
for a video streaming service.

2015
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:12,260
She does cosplay for cons and photoshoots.

2016
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:13,260
Twitch is out.

2017
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:16,260
Um, skipping, skipping, skipping.

2018
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:19,260
Um, she ruled out YouTube,

2019
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:21,260
saying that their streaming is shit.

2020
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:25,260
Uh, Mixer, from what I've been told, has issues.

2021
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:27,260
That being said, can you think of any alternatives?

2022
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:30,260
If need be, we can discuss this more off-air

2023
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:32,260
if you need more info or details.

2024
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:34,260
Normally, I would just close an e-mail

2025
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:35,260
with my brand of humor,

2026
01:36:35,260 --> 01:36:36,260
but this time, I'll skip the humor

2027
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:37,260
and just say this.

2028
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:39,260
Slash kitty, you have my full support,

2029
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:41,260
and I will do what I can to help.

2030
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:44,260
Um, doesn't Vimeo do, like, streaming, too?

2031
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:45,260
Yes.

2032
01:36:45,260 --> 01:36:48,260
And first off, in response to talking about it off-air,

2033
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:50,260
there's only gonna be, like, two people to get this joke,

2034
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:52,260
but, Raginator, nothing you ask matters

2035
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:54,260
unless that audio is rolling.

2036
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:55,260
You get the joke, Jamie?

2037
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:57,260
All right, anyway, it's a Drag Race reference.

2038
01:36:57,260 --> 01:37:00,260
Anyway, um, I know, Loki, you're not supposed to get it.

2039
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:03,260
All right, anyway, uh, in all seriousness,

2040
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:06,260
uh, yeah, Vimeo, I guess, is one.

2041
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:08,260
I mean, gosh, cutting yourself out of YouTube,

2042
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:10,260
that is a big chunk of it.

2043
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:14,260
Um, here's, I mean,

2044
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:16,260
I'm gonna give you an honest answer,

2045
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:18,260
and I'm not saying this to sound, like, skeezy

2046
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:21,260
or anything like that, but OnlyFans,

2047
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:24,260
and I realize that is a usually thing

2048
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:26,260
associated with pornography.

2049
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:28,260
I'm bringing it up because I'm not gonna shame sex workers.

2050
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:30,260
I don't know if that is anything at all remotely

2051
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:32,260
that the person is interested in,

2052
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:34,260
but it doesn't have to be that.

2053
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:36,260
So, like, I know a podcast I listen to

2054
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:39,260
is kinda half talking about doing something with OnlyFans,

2055
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:41,260
so, I mean, just, I just thrown it out there as an option.

2056
01:37:41,260 --> 01:37:43,260
It is an option.

2057
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:46,260
Um, maybe, doesn't Patreon allow you

2058
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:49,260
to unlock video stuff on there?

2059
01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:51,260
But I don't think it's streaming.

2060
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:54,260
Oh, I thought they had, like, a built-in VOD thing,

2061
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:56,260
but you had to, like, actually pay for the Patreon

2062
01:37:56,260 --> 01:37:57,260
in order to see it.

2063
01:37:57,260 --> 01:37:59,260
I don't know, I'm not gonna really use it.

2064
01:37:59,260 --> 01:38:01,260
Wait, what are we, streaming adult content?

2065
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:03,260
No, no, no, no, no, I, no, just, like,

2066
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:05,260
not necessarily.

2067
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:07,260
My answer kinda got into that

2068
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:09,260
because if that's something somebody wants to do,

2069
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:12,260
then go for it, but I don't think it was specifically that.

2070
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:14,260
I think it was just cosplay, featuring,

2071
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:16,260
and things like that.

2072
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:18,260
I mean, if it were me doing that,

2073
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:21,260
I wouldn't stream cosplay stuff at all.

2074
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:25,260
I would do more of the Instagram route.

2075
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:26,260
I don't know.

2076
01:38:26,260 --> 01:38:28,260
Oh, Instagram's a great idea, actually.

2077
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:29,260
But you can do video,

2078
01:38:29,260 --> 01:38:32,260
and you can do live stuff on Instagram and Facebook.

2079
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:34,260
And they have that new Instagram TV thing, too.

2080
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:35,260
So, there's that.

2081
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:37,260
Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.

2082
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:38,260
Good suggestion.

2083
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:40,260
Um, and then also, uh, D'Artezia suggests

2084
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:42,260
is Ustream still around?

2085
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:44,260
I thought maybe it was, like,

2086
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:46,260
I thought maybe it shut down at some point.

2087
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:48,260
I think they're still there because of, uh,

2088
01:38:48,260 --> 01:38:51,260
the PlayStation will still let you stream there, won't it?

2089
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:52,260
And that would be,

2090
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:55,260
Dailymotion would be, uh, part of that as well.

2091
01:38:55,260 --> 01:38:56,260
So, I think, uh,

2092
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:59,260
the PlayStation 4 officially supports all those, uh, platforms,

2093
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:01,260
even though they're not as common.

2094
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:03,260
And I don't know, like, as far as what,

2095
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:06,260
what type of, like, account, like,

2096
01:39:06,260 --> 01:39:09,260
you know, what offerings you're talking about here,

2097
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:12,260
but, like, I know there's, like, subreddits and stuff

2098
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:14,260
where people offer stuff like that,

2099
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:17,260
and, like, photos and, you know, stuff where they can sell.

2100
01:39:17,260 --> 01:39:19,260
And I don't know what services they use,

2101
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:20,260
but you can always see,

2102
01:39:20,260 --> 01:39:22,260
hey, what are you using for your shit?

2103
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:24,260
And use the same thing.

2104
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:26,260
Yeah, I think Instagram was really the best suggestion

2105
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:28,260
because, um, I know Aria Snark,

2106
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:30,260
who does a lot of cosplay that was hosting

2107
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:32,260
Shaking and Crying with Me for a while.

2108
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:34,260
She's been building and building on Instagram

2109
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:35,260
and doing very well.

2110
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:37,260
There's a few other cosplayers that I follow.

2111
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:39,260
Um, in fact, I'm, you know,

2112
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:41,260
as soon as I get back to learning my DMs,

2113
01:39:41,260 --> 01:39:43,260
learning my damn sewing machine,

2114
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:45,260
my own cosplay is gonna be going up there

2115
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:47,260
under its own account, which, by the way,

2116
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:49,260
you can follow me on Instagram as DarkSakura.

2117
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:51,260
You can follow Midna as Batittles.

2118
01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:53,260
Uh, TigerClaw says Ustream is around,

2119
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:55,260
but it's no longer called Ustream.

2120
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:57,260
It's IBM Cloud Video.

2121
01:39:57,260 --> 01:39:59,260
IBM's buying all this shit, aren't they?

2122
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:01,260
They just bought Red Hat, too.

2123
01:40:01,260 --> 01:40:03,260
There you go. Microsoft just acquired GitHub.

2124
01:40:03,260 --> 01:40:05,260
Everything, everything's been bought.

2125
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:07,260
Did you know that DreamWorks used to do all of their, um,

2126
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:10,260
proprietary rendering software in, um, Red Hat?

2127
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:12,260
I know now.

2128
01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:14,260
I got to speak with somebody who graduated from my college

2129
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:16,260
and went on to work for DreamWorks

2130
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,260
and worked on the Sherman and Peabody movie.

2131
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:20,260
Oh. And I asked them about their rendering software.

2132
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:22,260
He's like, yeah, it all runs in Red Hat, and it's proprietary.

2133
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:24,260
Huh. Cool. How about that?

2134
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:25,260
You learn something every day.

2135
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:26,260
All right, if that's it for emails,

2136
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:28,260
I'll encourage you to send more emails.

2137
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:30,260
Participate at orangelandtrader.com

2138
01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:32,260
is the place to send emails in the future.

2139
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:34,260
In the meantime, we've got some more news stories

2140
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:37,260
for you guys, and we'll get to our Skype line eventually.

2141
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:39,260
Loki, what do you have for us?

2142
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:41,260
Well, VR's canceled.

2143
01:40:41,260 --> 01:40:43,260
No, just kidding.

2144
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:45,260
Um, so apparently the, um,

2145
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:50,260
there is rumors that the Rift 2 is canceled,

2146
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:52,260
and apparently the co-founder of Oculus

2147
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:55,260
has left the company as well.

2148
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:57,260
Now, what this would necessarily mean

2149
01:40:57,260 --> 01:40:59,260
is not necessarily that they're gonna stop

2150
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:01,260
development of the Oculus Rift.

2151
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:04,260
It's just that what was currently the Rift 2

2152
01:41:04,260 --> 01:41:06,260
is now not being worked on,

2153
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:08,260
and I'm probably in part with the fact

2154
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:11,260
that they've done stuff like, so the Oculus, um,

2155
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:12,260
what the hell was the last Oculus

2156
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:14,260
that they put out, the standalone one?

2157
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:15,260
I don't remember what the fuck it's called.

2158
01:41:15,260 --> 01:41:18,260
But, um, they have other Oculus products

2159
01:41:18,260 --> 01:41:20,260
that are gonna be available instead.

2160
01:41:20,260 --> 01:41:23,260
So, um, Michael Abrash basically said that,

2161
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:26,260
you know, these are the good, these are the good old days,

2162
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:30,260
um, when they're talking about, like, you know,

2163
01:41:30,260 --> 01:41:33,260
as far as how VR has come along.

2164
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:36,260
Um, but now, of course, you know, with that,

2165
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:39,260
they're gonna be pushing for new hardware,

2166
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:41,260
maybe going in even a different direction

2167
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:43,260
with stuff like that, you know, um,

2168
01:41:43,260 --> 01:41:46,260
the brand new Oculus headset that they have as standalone.

2169
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:48,260
I'm curious to see, like, what's gonna run on that,

2170
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:49,260
because I know they have, like,

2171
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:51,260
was it the whole Vader thing,

2172
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:54,260
but, like, what else can it do?

2173
01:41:54,260 --> 01:41:57,260
Is it, how is this gonna, like, tie in with Facebook again,

2174
01:41:57,260 --> 01:41:59,260
you know, with, are they gonna be doing, like,

2175
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:01,260
you know, some sort of VR Facebook crap on there?

2176
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:03,260
I don't know if this is directly related,

2177
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:05,260
but I will say one thing that I've been saying

2178
01:42:05,260 --> 01:42:07,260
and the one thing that I've been super into

2179
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:09,260
that I think is neat on Facebook lately,

2180
01:42:09,260 --> 01:42:11,260
and I know Dark Soccer's feeling this too,

2181
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:14,260
is that they just enabled those 3D photos,

2182
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:18,260
and if you have a phone that has basically two lenses,

2183
01:42:18,260 --> 01:42:22,260
so I know any iPhone, uh, past seven will do it,

2184
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:26,260
because if your phone can do the portrait thing on iPhone,

2185
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:27,260
I don't know what the Android equivalent is,

2186
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:29,260
but it's just, like, basically just two,

2187
01:42:29,260 --> 01:42:30,260
it has to have, like, one camera

2188
01:42:30,260 --> 01:42:32,260
and a depth perception lens as well.

2189
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:34,260
It's called the knockoff.

2190
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:35,260
Yeah, well, you know.

2191
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:38,260
Um, but anyway, as long as your phone has that

2192
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:39,260
and that data's in the picture,

2193
01:42:39,260 --> 01:42:42,260
you can post these 3D pictures to Facebook.

2194
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:43,260
They're weird, though.

2195
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:44,260
Yeah, they're kinda trippy.

2196
01:42:44,260 --> 01:42:47,260
But it, did you see the one I did of my, uh, tea mug?

2197
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:48,260
I don't think I saw that one.

2198
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:49,260
Yeah, it kinda got jacked up on that.

2199
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:52,260
Yeah, the, basically, because it's clear glass

2200
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:56,260
and the top part of the mug ended up foreground,

2201
01:42:56,260 --> 01:42:57,260
and then, of the handle,

2202
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:59,260
and then the bottom half that was lighter

2203
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:02,260
ended up as background, so it's, like, it's split apart.

2204
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:03,260
Okay, that's trippy.

2205
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:04,260
Let me really quickly read the whole excerpt

2206
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:06,260
that he put in his Facebook post.

2207
01:43:06,260 --> 01:43:07,260
So, so much has happened since the day

2208
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:10,260
we found out Oculus in 2012, or July 2012.

2209
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:13,260
I never could have imagined how much we would accomplish

2210
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:14,260
and how far we would come,

2211
01:43:14,260 --> 01:43:17,260
and now, after six incredible years, I am moving on.

2212
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:18,260
I am deeply proud and grateful

2213
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:20,260
for all that we have done together.

2214
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:21,260
We have assembled one of the greatest

2215
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:23,260
research and engineering teams in history,

2216
01:43:23,260 --> 01:43:26,260
delivered the first step of true virtual presence

2217
01:43:26,260 --> 01:43:28,260
with Oculus Rift in touch,

2218
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:30,260
and inspired an entirely new industry.

2219
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:33,260
We started a revolution that will change the world

2220
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:35,260
in ways we can only envision.

2221
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:39,260
Yet, as far as we've come, the journey has just begun.

2222
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:43,260
You know, basically talking about the good old days.

2223
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:45,260
And then, now, when we pioneer the foundation

2224
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:48,260
for the next great computing platform and medium,

2225
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:50,260
this is our time to be pushing state-of-the-art

2226
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:51,260
onward and upward.

2227
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:54,260
Every part of AR, VR needs to improve,

2228
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:56,260
especially the hardware and core technology.

2229
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:59,260
So, I think it sounds to me like the frustration

2230
01:43:59,260 --> 01:44:02,260
may have been that, you know, now we have this,

2231
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:04,260
I don't know, maybe the standalone software.

2232
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:05,260
I think he's expecting more.

2233
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:08,260
Maybe we're just not pushing it enough.

2234
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:09,260
But I still think they need to get

2235
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:10,260
the kind of saturation out there first

2236
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:12,260
before we're really pushing the technology,

2237
01:44:12,260 --> 01:44:14,260
but maybe doing both at the same time.

2238
01:44:14,260 --> 01:44:15,260
Yeah.

2239
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:16,260
Because how do you make it affordable

2240
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:18,260
and entry-level for people to get into it,

2241
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:21,260
to get wanting more as far out of the hardware and everything?

2242
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:22,260
Right.

2243
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:23,260
I don't know.

2244
01:44:23,260 --> 01:44:24,260
And, obviously, Facebook acquiring this

2245
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:27,260
was never really about only games.

2246
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:28,260
Although, you know, it's interesting

2247
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:30,260
talking about kind of like other moves

2248
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:33,260
that Facebook makes and how it might relate to this

2249
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:34,260
because, you know, we just talked about

2250
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:36,260
the 3D pictures thing and how, actually,

2251
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:38,260
I find that stuff to be really fascinating.

2252
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:40,260
I mean, it's still got issues,

2253
01:44:40,260 --> 01:44:42,260
like Darcy points out with her tea mug picture,

2254
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:44,260
but, like, the picture I posted of, like,

2255
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:47,260
Mr. Smoosh lying down in 3D got, like, a ton of feedback

2256
01:44:47,260 --> 01:44:49,260
because people were like, that is so cool.

2257
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:51,260
And, like, it was just a normal picture

2258
01:44:51,260 --> 01:44:53,260
I took in portrait mode because you can go back

2259
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:55,260
to any picture in your library that you took in the past

2260
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:57,260
in portrait mode and it'll run its filter on it,

2261
01:44:57,260 --> 01:44:58,260
which is really cool.

2262
01:44:58,260 --> 01:45:02,260
So, anyway, you know, but I noticed one thing,

2263
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:03,260
and this is annoying me about Facebook,

2264
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:05,260
is that now, like, every time I open up

2265
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:07,260
Facebook on my phone, the games thing lights up

2266
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:10,260
with, like, you have one notification in games.

2267
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:11,260
You have this in games.

2268
01:45:11,260 --> 01:45:12,260
It's like, I don't, like, I really wish

2269
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:14,260
I could just, like, get rid of that or uninstall it

2270
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:16,260
because I'm not interested in doing games.

2271
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:20,260
It's going back to the whole, remember when people

2272
01:45:20,260 --> 01:45:22,260
get super fucking annoyed at this on Facebook

2273
01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:25,260
when it's like a friend has sent you something in Farmville.

2274
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:26,260
A friend needs you to get their farm

2275
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:28,260
in Farmville, so you get, like, 20 of those requests.

2276
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:29,260
Yeah, I remember blocking all that shit.

2277
01:45:29,260 --> 01:45:32,260
Like, I feel like Facebook is, like, coming back to that,

2278
01:45:32,260 --> 01:45:34,260
but it's Facebook's own shit where it's like

2279
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:36,260
you have a post in a new gaming community.

2280
01:45:36,260 --> 01:45:37,260
No, I get that all the time and, like,

2281
01:45:37,260 --> 01:45:39,260
I've turned off notifications for most everything.

2282
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:42,260
I don't need to know when someone's posted a picture

2283
01:45:42,260 --> 01:45:43,260
or something like that unless I'm, like,

2284
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:46,260
specifically choosing to be notified by that,

2285
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:48,260
but they keep doing that.

2286
01:45:48,260 --> 01:45:49,260
Like, oh, you have a notification.

2287
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:51,260
It's like, oh, such and such has posted something

2288
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:52,260
on their Instagram feed.

2289
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:54,260
I don't fucking care about Instagram.

2290
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:55,260
I'm on Facebook.

2291
01:45:55,260 --> 01:45:57,260
I don't give a shit about that.

2292
01:45:57,260 --> 01:45:59,260
Or I, this person's posted a photo

2293
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:02,260
or this person's posted a comment or, like, an update.

2294
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:04,260
Who cares?

2295
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:05,260
I don't care.

2296
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:07,260
If I wanted to be notified by that,

2297
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:12,260
I would set my notifications to be like that.

2298
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:14,260
All right, yeah, I just, that's the type of crap

2299
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:16,260
that's gonna just annoy me with Facebook

2300
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:18,260
and make me just uninstall it for my phone again,

2301
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:20,260
but it's like, it's a double-edged sword

2302
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:22,260
because, you know, where else am I gonna show people

2303
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:24,260
the picture of me dressed up as sexy?

2304
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:26,260
Which was my Halloween costume, by the way,

2305
01:46:26,260 --> 01:46:27,260
if you weren't already aware.

2306
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:28,260
So, and then, of course, to go back to...

2307
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:30,260
Where's your Miss Peacock shoes?

2308
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:31,260
They were my Miss Peacock shoes.

2309
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:33,260
If I'm gonna, girl, if I'm gonna spend $40

2310
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:34,260
on a pair of heels,

2311
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:35,260
you know I'm gonna wear them more than once.

2312
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:37,260
So, to go back to the article real quick.

2313
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:39,260
So, the actual reason that he left is,

2314
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:41,260
basically, he had fundamentally different views

2315
01:46:41,260 --> 01:46:44,260
of the future of Oculus that grew deeper over time

2316
01:46:44,260 --> 01:46:47,260
and wasn't interested in the race to the bottom.

2317
01:46:47,260 --> 01:46:49,260
So, it sounds like, you know,

2318
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:52,260
maybe the race to make it cheaper, more affordable.

2319
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:53,260
I don't know.

2320
01:46:53,260 --> 01:46:55,260
He wants to really push the VR hardware,

2321
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:58,260
which, you know, I'm kind of on board with that.

2322
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:00,260
But, at the same time, I understand why they have to

2323
01:47:00,260 --> 01:47:02,260
because you gotta get people interested in it

2324
01:47:02,260 --> 01:47:05,260
in order to push this high-end hardware.

2325
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:06,260
Yeah.

2326
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:07,260
All right.

2327
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:10,260
Well, we'll see what the future is gonna hold for this.

2328
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:13,260
I don't think, necessarily, that, you know,

2329
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:15,260
Facebook is just, like, totally getting out of VR,

2330
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:17,260
but maybe it's not gonna be, like, kind of like,

2331
01:47:17,260 --> 01:47:21,260
it's, like, not necessarily a race to outdo Vive

2332
01:47:21,260 --> 01:47:24,260
and PlayStation VR, which are starting to cement themselves

2333
01:47:24,260 --> 01:47:25,260
as more like the gaming options.

2334
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:27,260
I really wish PlayStation would come out with some new

2335
01:47:27,260 --> 01:47:29,260
goddamn, like, controllers for that shit

2336
01:47:29,260 --> 01:47:31,260
because those move controllers are...

2337
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:34,260
I would assume, and it's the biggest assumption,

2338
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:36,260
but I would assume any of that type of stuff

2339
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:38,260
is being rolled over to PlayStation 5

2340
01:47:38,260 --> 01:47:41,260
and how VR might work with PlayStation 5 at this point.

2341
01:47:41,260 --> 01:47:44,260
So, speaking of PlayStation VR...

2342
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:46,260
I have not played it yet.

2343
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:48,260
Shame on you!

2344
01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:49,260
I just...

2345
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:50,260
Shame!

2346
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:52,260
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

2347
01:47:52,260 --> 01:47:54,260
We're, what, two weeks out from Tetris Effect?

2348
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:55,260
Yes.

2349
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:56,260
So, it's gonna happen.

2350
01:47:56,260 --> 01:47:58,260
So, I am excited.

2351
01:47:58,260 --> 01:48:01,260
I actually was listening to the soundtrack of Tetris Effect

2352
01:48:01,260 --> 01:48:02,260
the other day.

2353
01:48:02,260 --> 01:48:03,260
It's so good.

2354
01:48:03,260 --> 01:48:04,260
Oh, yeah, they have a soundtrack online?

2355
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:06,260
Yeah, because if you pre-order it, you get the soundtrack.

2356
01:48:06,260 --> 01:48:07,260
And somebody put it all on YouTube.

2357
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:08,260
It's great.

2358
01:48:08,260 --> 01:48:09,260
I do need to pre-order and get the soundtrack.

2359
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:10,260
Yeah, it's great.

2360
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:11,260
All right.

2361
01:48:11,260 --> 01:48:13,260
Let's get into some stories on Pokemon Go.

2362
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:15,260
The first story, which I know you guys love it

2363
01:48:15,260 --> 01:48:17,260
when we talk about it, but, you know,

2364
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:19,260
it's kind of a big deal,

2365
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:21,260
and this one was something Loki kind of referenced

2366
01:48:21,260 --> 01:48:25,260
a little bit ago, is that Niantic is going to be

2367
01:48:25,260 --> 01:48:27,260
unveiling an adventure sink.

2368
01:48:27,260 --> 01:48:29,260
They're calling it a Niantic real-world platform

2369
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:31,260
gameplay system that gives players

2370
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:33,260
more reason to go outside.

2371
01:48:33,260 --> 01:48:36,260
So, basically, what you're gonna be doing with this

2372
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:38,260
is that it will kind of tie together

2373
01:48:38,260 --> 01:48:42,260
with the health monitors in your phone, I guess,

2374
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:45,260
to actually give you credit for walking eggs

2375
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:47,260
and things of that sort,

2376
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:51,260
which is something that you get the credit

2377
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:53,260
for the egg walking and all that,

2378
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:55,260
but it's tied into the health apps

2379
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:56,260
that are already on your phone.

2380
01:48:56,260 --> 01:48:58,260
Well, yeah, and I saw that, and I hope that's the case

2381
01:48:58,260 --> 01:49:00,260
because I use those.

2382
01:49:00,260 --> 01:49:01,260
I don't know.

2383
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:05,260
I think it was just a Samsung Fit or the Android Fit.

2384
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:08,260
It's Android Google Fit, and it's iOS Health Kit.

2385
01:49:08,260 --> 01:49:10,260
All of my stuff ties into my health app.

2386
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:11,260
Right, and that's just the watch.

2387
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:13,260
I don't know if I used Android Fit.

2388
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:14,260
I used the Fitbit stuff.

2389
01:49:14,260 --> 01:49:15,260
I think that ties in with Android.

2390
01:49:15,260 --> 01:49:16,260
I'm sure it does.

2391
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:17,260
It should, but I don't know if there are issues.

2392
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:20,260
Now Pokemon goes working again on the Apple Watch.

2393
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:21,260
Oh, does the Apple Watch?

2394
01:49:21,260 --> 01:49:23,260
The Apple Watch thing has never worked for me.

2395
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:25,260
It's been pretty okay.

2396
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:27,260
I don't need it because I have the Gotcha,

2397
01:49:27,260 --> 01:49:29,260
but I do like that the watch...

2398
01:49:29,260 --> 01:49:31,260
But I like this for tracking my walking.

2399
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:32,260
Yeah, the watch tracks your...

2400
01:49:32,260 --> 01:49:35,260
You know what's funny is that before I got the watch,

2401
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:36,260
I was very much like, I don't need an Apple Watch.

2402
01:49:36,260 --> 01:49:37,260
I don't do any of that stuff,

2403
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:39,260
but then the exercise stuff kind of pulled me in,

2404
01:49:39,260 --> 01:49:41,260
and I really do like that it shows me,

2405
01:49:41,260 --> 01:49:43,260
like, oh, this is how much you've moved today.

2406
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:45,260
Get up off your butt and do some walking

2407
01:49:45,260 --> 01:49:46,260
because you haven't really done any.

2408
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:47,260
Mine reminds me to stand up

2409
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:49,260
instead of just getting so locked up in my work.

2410
01:49:49,260 --> 01:49:50,260
Yeah, and...

2411
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:51,260
But now you know why I stand up

2412
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:52,260
like every hour during the show.

2413
01:49:52,260 --> 01:49:53,260
Oh, for sure. No, because I...

2414
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:55,260
Well, I'd already hit my 12 hours before

2415
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:56,260
because I don't...

2416
01:49:56,260 --> 01:49:58,260
My phone stops reminding me after 12 hours.

2417
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:00,260
It doesn't remind me anymore.

2418
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:02,260
Yeah, mine goes from about nine to six.

2419
01:50:02,260 --> 01:50:03,260
It will stop.

2420
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:06,260
But then, you know, the other thing, though,

2421
01:50:06,260 --> 01:50:09,260
is that I'm also doing this mindfulness challenge at work

2422
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:13,260
where I think, like, the goal is to, like, do, like...

2423
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:16,260
What is it? 25 days at minimum?

2424
01:50:16,260 --> 01:50:17,260
Mm-hmm.

2425
01:50:17,260 --> 01:50:20,260
To do the meditation for 10 minutes,

2426
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:21,260
the breathing, the mindful breathing.

2427
01:50:21,260 --> 01:50:22,260
Yeah.

2428
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:24,260
And I've done every day this month.

2429
01:50:24,260 --> 01:50:25,260
That's great.

2430
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:27,260
Now, supposedly, this feature

2431
01:50:27,260 --> 01:50:29,260
is also going to let you have challenges,

2432
01:50:29,260 --> 01:50:31,260
kind of work with friends.

2433
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:33,260
There's going to be more stuff in the game,

2434
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:35,260
so it isn't enabled in the game yet.

2435
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:38,260
So as Joe and Hunter Matt in chat asks,

2436
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:39,260
so in order for this to work,

2437
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:42,260
you need to have background data enabled on Pokemon Go.

2438
01:50:42,260 --> 01:50:43,260
If it's going through other apps,

2439
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:44,260
I wonder if it does anymore.

2440
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:46,260
I don't think it does.

2441
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:47,260
Unfortunately, we're just not going to have

2442
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:49,260
a lot of answers to these questions

2443
01:50:49,260 --> 01:50:50,260
until the feature comes out

2444
01:50:50,260 --> 01:50:53,260
and those people on Silf Road tear it apart

2445
01:50:53,260 --> 01:50:54,260
in five minutes.

2446
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:55,260
I don't think it's going to have background data.

2447
01:50:55,260 --> 01:50:56,260
It's probably going to be just,

2448
01:50:56,260 --> 01:50:58,260
okay, you launch this app,

2449
01:50:58,260 --> 01:51:00,260
or the last time you launched this app was here,

2450
01:51:00,260 --> 01:51:03,260
and how many steps or whatever distance you've covered

2451
01:51:03,260 --> 01:51:04,260
between them.

2452
01:51:04,260 --> 01:51:05,260
And it's going to pull that from the health app.

2453
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:09,260
It's just like, yeah, it's like I use my fitness coach

2454
01:51:09,260 --> 01:51:10,260
for logging my food,

2455
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:12,260
and I use my Fitbit app for everything else,

2456
01:51:12,260 --> 01:51:13,260
for activity-wise.

2457
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:15,260
I kind of separate them that way.

2458
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:16,260
I don't know why.

2459
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:17,260
I just do it that way.

2460
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:20,260
Now, Rama's trying to give you some Android advice,

2461
01:51:20,260 --> 01:51:22,260
because DarkStalker and I can't really help there.

2462
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:24,260
Rama in chat says you have to open the Google Fit app

2463
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:26,260
and have it sync the Fitbit app.

2464
01:51:26,260 --> 01:51:29,260
Yeah, I was just about to download it,

2465
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:31,260
because I don't have it installed on my phone.

2466
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:32,260
Get on that.

2467
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:34,260
Hatch them eggs.

2468
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:37,260
But I have so many fitness trackers.

2469
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:39,260
Niantic will just sell more incubators

2470
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:41,260
so they're all about this, I'm sure.

2471
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:44,260
But I imagine this feature will probably be unlocked

2472
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:45,260
at some point in the next week.

2473
01:51:45,260 --> 01:51:47,260
I don't know if they're going to make us wait

2474
01:51:47,260 --> 01:51:48,260
all the way until the Halloween event is over,

2475
01:51:48,260 --> 01:51:50,260
but we shall see.

2476
01:51:50,260 --> 01:51:53,260
So lots of news around Pokémon GO right now.

2477
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:55,260
Not all of it good, right, DarkStalker?

2478
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:57,260
Fuck that.

2479
01:51:57,260 --> 01:52:00,260
Yeah, so Niantic posted on their Twitter,

2480
01:52:00,260 --> 01:52:04,260
Trainers in Arizona come join the Autism Speaks Walk

2481
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:08,260
on October 28th and raise money for SARRC,

2482
01:52:08,260 --> 01:52:10,260
which provides research, treatment, education,

2483
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:12,260
and community outreach for people with autism.

2484
01:52:12,260 --> 01:52:14,260
First of all, fuck Autism Speaks.

2485
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:16,260
Fuck them, fuck them, fuck them.

2486
01:52:16,260 --> 01:52:19,260
It wasn't until this year that they finally got

2487
01:52:19,260 --> 01:52:21,260
an autistic person on their board.

2488
01:52:21,260 --> 01:52:25,260
They spent decades sharing misinformation

2489
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:27,260
and treating us like we have a disease,

2490
01:52:27,260 --> 01:52:30,260
instead of this just being how our brains are wired.

2491
01:52:30,260 --> 01:52:37,260
They advocate the ADA, which is like this behavioral therapy.

2492
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:38,260
ABA.

2493
01:52:38,260 --> 01:52:39,260
ABA, sorry.

2494
01:52:39,260 --> 01:52:41,260
It's this behavioral therapy that, in some cases,

2495
01:52:41,260 --> 01:52:45,260
have been borderline abusive to kids.

2496
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:48,260
I'm sure there are some places that do it better,

2497
01:52:48,260 --> 01:52:51,260
but a lot of times I will just see, like,

2498
01:52:51,260 --> 01:52:53,260
completely outrageous things that are done against children.

2499
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:55,260
And then they, you know, started putting out

2500
01:52:55,260 --> 01:53:00,260
all of these videos and this propaganda, really,

2501
01:53:00,260 --> 01:53:03,260
that were saying that people with autism

2502
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:06,260
are a danger to their parents and a burden

2503
01:53:06,260 --> 01:53:08,260
and that we need to be, quote, cured.

2504
01:53:08,260 --> 01:53:11,260
Fuck that, fuck that noise, and fuck you Niantic

2505
01:53:11,260 --> 01:53:14,260
for not doing any goddamn research

2506
01:53:14,260 --> 01:53:19,260
and working with a good place like ASAN,

2507
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:21,260
the Autism Self Advocacy Network,

2508
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:24,260
and any of these other places that are not just

2509
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:26,260
this money-grabbing shithole.

2510
01:53:26,260 --> 01:53:28,260
They are on par with the Komen Foundation.

2511
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:30,260
They are just completely terrible.

2512
01:53:30,260 --> 01:53:33,260
Do not give Autism Speaks any of your money,

2513
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:39,260
and if you are in Arizona, please do not support this event.

2514
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:42,260
Give your money to a good service

2515
01:53:42,260 --> 01:53:45,260
that will do good things for people with autism.

2516
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:48,260
Now Niantic did seem to acknowledge some of the feedback,

2517
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:51,260
but I got the sense they kind of had to do it in a way

2518
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:53,260
that they weren't going to pull out of the event,

2519
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:55,260
but they may not be able to.

2520
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:57,260
Honestly, it may be at the point where it's kind of like

2521
01:53:57,260 --> 01:53:59,260
once you commit something, you can't really do it.

2522
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:01,260
You can't really necessarily just yank yourself out,

2523
01:54:01,260 --> 01:54:03,260
especially if the check's already been cashed.

2524
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:05,260
But I remember seeing a tweet from them that kind of said,

2525
01:54:05,260 --> 01:54:07,260
we heard your feedback, and we look forward to working

2526
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:09,260
with other charities in the future.

2527
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:11,260
We want to hear your feedback on what charities

2528
01:54:11,260 --> 01:54:13,260
we should be working with type of thing.

2529
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:15,260
That's kind of what I drew from it.

2530
01:54:15,260 --> 01:54:20,260
But I guess for maybe folks that don't totally like,

2531
01:54:20,260 --> 01:54:23,260
because this is a good comparison in my head

2532
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:27,260
to kind of understand where your anger comes from,

2533
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:32,260
is that this would be if Niantic got an offer on their desk

2534
01:54:32,260 --> 01:54:37,260
that says, we want you to sign up for this charity

2535
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:39,260
that helps gay children.

2536
01:54:39,260 --> 01:54:41,260
This charity helps gay children,

2537
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:43,260
and we want you to be a partner in this

2538
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:46,260
so we can raise money to help gay children.

2539
01:54:46,260 --> 01:54:48,260
And Niantic probably thinks, oh, that sounds like,

2540
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:50,260
you're right, there's so many gay kids out there

2541
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:52,260
that get kicked out of their homes,

2542
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:55,260
and they need a place to go, and we want to help.

2543
01:54:55,260 --> 01:54:57,260
You're right, we should sign off on that,

2544
01:54:57,260 --> 01:54:59,260
because that sounds good, and that's doing good.

2545
01:54:59,260 --> 01:55:02,260
And then it turns out, what did this charity mean

2546
01:55:02,260 --> 01:55:04,260
when they say, help gay children?

2547
01:55:04,260 --> 01:55:06,260
It's conversion therapy.

2548
01:55:06,260 --> 01:55:08,260
It's conversion therapy, electroshock therapy,

2549
01:55:08,260 --> 01:55:10,260
or something like that, right?

2550
01:55:10,260 --> 01:55:12,260
Is that a fair comparison to where your anger comes from

2551
01:55:12,260 --> 01:55:14,260
when you talk about Autism Speaks?

2552
01:55:14,260 --> 01:55:16,260
Is that it's like...

2553
01:55:16,260 --> 01:55:19,260
Probably not in that level of extreme,

2554
01:55:19,260 --> 01:55:24,260
but it's just where the place that they're coming from is.

2555
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:28,260
Is that they treat us like we're a disease.

2556
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:31,260
Like, there's something wrong with us to cure.

2557
01:55:31,260 --> 01:55:34,260
And neurodivergence is not a disease.

2558
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:36,260
It is how your brain is wired.

2559
01:55:36,260 --> 01:55:39,260
And there are a lot of us who function perfectly fine in the world.

2560
01:55:39,260 --> 01:55:41,260
I mean, there's a lot of nonverbal people.

2561
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:44,260
There's a lot of people who just completely cannot function.

2562
01:55:44,260 --> 01:55:47,260
Those people could probably use more assistance.

2563
01:55:47,260 --> 01:55:50,260
But what we need a lot is people to understand

2564
01:55:50,260 --> 01:55:52,260
that not everyone is going to approach things

2565
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:55,260
from the same point of view that you do.

2566
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:59,260
It takes multiple levels of thought

2567
01:55:59,260 --> 01:56:02,260
and thought processes to make the world work.

2568
01:56:02,260 --> 01:56:05,260
If you are finding that you can't communicate with someone with autism,

2569
01:56:05,260 --> 01:56:07,260
maybe you should change how you talk

2570
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:10,260
instead of asking them to rewire themselves.

2571
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:14,260
How does Niantic get themselves out of this hole that they've dug

2572
01:56:14,260 --> 01:56:17,260
with especially the autistic community?

2573
01:56:18,260 --> 01:56:20,260
Short of pulling out.

2574
01:56:20,260 --> 01:56:23,260
Let's say checks been cashed.

2575
01:56:23,260 --> 01:56:25,260
Pulling out at this point is not an option.

2576
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:28,260
So short of that, what can they do to fix this?

2577
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:30,260
Not work with Autism Speaks again.

2578
01:56:30,260 --> 01:56:32,260
I mean, ever again.

2579
01:56:32,260 --> 01:56:35,260
I did find the two posts that they made about that,

2580
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:37,260
so I'll just read them real quick.

2581
01:56:37,260 --> 01:56:41,260
They basically left out all mention of Autism Speaks now.

2582
01:56:41,260 --> 01:56:45,260
We're excited to support the SARRC in their walk,

2583
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:48,260
which is directly benefiting the school,

2584
01:56:48,260 --> 01:56:51,260
and appreciate the response that many of you had about the event.

2585
01:56:51,260 --> 01:56:53,260
If you want to read more about them and their work,

2586
01:56:53,260 --> 01:56:55,260
we encourage you to learn here, autismcenter.org.

2587
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:59,260
So that I think they are separating themselves from Autism Speaks already,

2588
01:56:59,260 --> 01:57:01,260
which is good.

2589
01:57:01,260 --> 01:57:03,260
And then the second thing was the one that you said.

2590
01:57:03,260 --> 01:57:05,260
We hear and appreciate all the feedback

2591
01:57:05,260 --> 01:57:07,260
as well as the other recommendations for autism organizations

2592
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:09,260
that you'd love to see supported.

2593
01:57:09,260 --> 01:57:13,260
So please continue to share some of the organizations you're close to.

2594
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:16,260
So I think that they are realizing

2595
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:19,260
that they did dig themselves into a pile of shit,

2596
01:57:19,260 --> 01:57:25,260
and are really just...

2597
01:57:27,260 --> 01:57:31,260
I will say to Niantic's somewhat credit,

2598
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:33,260
not in this situation certainly,

2599
01:57:33,260 --> 01:57:38,260
but it is nice to see Niantic wanting to use their game to benefit charities.

2600
01:57:38,260 --> 01:57:41,260
It's a worthy... I mean, they've just got to get the right charities.

2601
01:57:42,260 --> 01:57:47,260
One person that posted something in a response

2602
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:50,260
is actually exactly how I feel.

2603
01:57:50,260 --> 01:57:52,260
And the thing is that they're still not acknowledging

2604
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:56,260
that SARRC still has ties to Autism Speaks.

2605
01:57:56,260 --> 01:58:01,260
Rewording it isn't going to completely change this.

2606
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:05,260
Especially the fact that Autism Speaks actually has a background

2607
01:58:05,260 --> 01:58:09,260
in being involved in eugenics programs.

2608
01:58:09,260 --> 01:58:12,260
And has for a while. It's completely disgusting.

2609
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:14,260
But here's the response I like.

2610
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:18,260
This is Shiroko Spooky at Yomacon.

2611
01:58:18,260 --> 01:58:21,260
I'm extremely disturbed to think that you'd financially support

2612
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:24,260
or promote an organization dedicated to erasing people like me

2613
01:58:24,260 --> 01:58:28,260
through quote prevention via keeping autistic babies

2614
01:58:28,260 --> 01:58:30,260
from even being born simply because they're autistic

2615
01:58:30,260 --> 01:58:34,260
and quote treatment via shock therapy and worse.

2616
01:58:34,260 --> 01:58:37,260
So taking Autism Speaks out of it,

2617
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:40,260
and still using another organization that works closely with them,

2618
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:43,260
I don't want any of my money going to this.

2619
01:58:43,260 --> 01:58:48,260
So when the event is over, I will buy stuff again.

2620
01:58:48,260 --> 01:58:52,260
But I'm going to make 100% positive that there has been no association

2621
01:58:52,260 --> 01:58:55,260
if I start giving them money again.

2622
01:58:55,260 --> 01:58:59,260
Because they're not getting a cent from me until this is over.

2623
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:02,260
Getting some comments from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

2624
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:03,260
Rama in chat says,

2625
01:59:03,260 --> 01:59:06,260
I don't think Niantic really knew how bad Autism Speaks really is.

2626
01:59:06,260 --> 01:59:07,260
S2100matt says,

2627
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:09,260
I think Niantic's heart was in the right place,

2628
01:59:09,260 --> 01:59:11,260
but they just didn't do the proper research.

2629
01:59:11,260 --> 01:59:12,260
They've learned their lesson now.

2630
01:59:12,260 --> 01:59:15,260
Well, your brain needs to be in the right place.

2631
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:16,260
Time will see.

2632
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:19,260
So, Dr. C in chat says,

2633
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:21,260
I've heard all the bullshit Autism Speaks has been up to.

2634
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:23,260
I used to follow Hot Wheels on Facebook.

2635
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:25,260
Hey, been a fan of the diecast car since I was little.

2636
01:59:25,260 --> 01:59:28,260
But then I found out they were teaming up with Autism Speaks on something,

2637
01:59:28,260 --> 01:59:29,260
so I was done.

2638
01:59:29,260 --> 01:59:33,260
So, you know, and kind of something I expressed,

2639
01:59:33,260 --> 01:59:35,260
we were texting about this yesterday or the day before,

2640
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:37,260
I was kind of expressing shock.

2641
01:59:37,260 --> 01:59:40,260
I was like, well, I mean, I get that this is bothersome,

2642
01:59:40,260 --> 01:59:44,260
but how does this fucking charity stay afloat?

2643
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:46,260
Like, that's my bigger question.

2644
01:59:46,260 --> 01:59:50,260
Like, how is this charity even still in existence?

2645
01:59:50,260 --> 01:59:53,260
So, I guess education is a big part of that.

2646
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:55,260
Wasn't I saying it has a lot to do with their PR?

2647
01:59:55,260 --> 01:59:56,260
Probably.

2648
01:59:56,260 --> 01:59:57,260
You know, the fact that,

2649
01:59:57,260 --> 02:00:02,260
and I even have an autistic friend who says that she got a lot of assistance from them.

2650
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:08,260
But, you know, and doesn't see where all the bad press is coming from,

2651
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:11,260
but I'm like, how about the rest of us who have been a complete,

2652
02:00:11,260 --> 02:00:14,260
or, you know, there's people in other threads I've seen on there,

2653
02:00:14,260 --> 02:00:18,260
who when they got their diagnosis as an adult reached out for assistance

2654
02:00:18,260 --> 02:00:22,260
and were basically just completely ignored or told to find somebody else.

2655
02:00:22,260 --> 02:00:24,260
Like, in those words.

2656
02:00:24,260 --> 02:00:30,260
You know, it's, and the thing I like about the Autism Self Advocacy Network

2657
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:34,260
is that their motto is nothing for us without us.

2658
02:00:34,260 --> 02:00:39,260
And there's not many things that I will get super heated about.

2659
02:00:39,260 --> 02:00:41,260
There are some things.

2660
02:00:41,260 --> 02:00:44,260
This one I feel very passionately about because…

2661
02:00:44,260 --> 02:00:45,260
Well, sure.

2662
02:00:45,260 --> 02:00:48,260
And that's why I really brought up the scenario about the whole, like,

2663
02:00:48,260 --> 02:00:51,260
conversion therapy thing, like, trying to make an analogy.

2664
02:00:51,260 --> 02:00:55,260
Because if it was that, like, not that I'm not pissed off on your behalf,

2665
02:00:55,260 --> 02:00:59,260
but, like, I would be really pissed off if it was, like, the scenario I described.

2666
02:00:59,260 --> 02:01:02,260
Now that I think about it, actually it is fairly apt because, I mean,

2667
02:01:02,260 --> 02:01:05,260
they are doing shock therapy to autistic kids out there.

2668
02:01:05,260 --> 02:01:07,260
That's what they're thinking, yeah.

2669
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:11,260
And even though he's one of my favorite actors, Jim Beaver,

2670
02:01:11,260 --> 02:01:18,260
who was on Supernatural, I reached out to him to ask about his daughter's treatment

2671
02:01:18,260 --> 02:01:21,260
because his daughter was, I think, non-verbal for a while.

2672
02:01:21,260 --> 02:01:23,260
And he's like, she's not autistic anymore.

2673
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:26,260
I'm like, what the fuck do you mean she's not autistic anymore?

2674
02:01:26,260 --> 02:01:28,260
You never are not autistic.

2675
02:01:28,260 --> 02:01:30,260
It just means she's learned behavioral therapies.

2676
02:01:30,260 --> 02:01:34,260
You cannot cure autism.

2677
02:01:34,260 --> 02:01:36,260
It's not a disease.

2678
02:01:36,260 --> 02:01:38,260
And vaccines don't cause it.

2679
02:01:38,260 --> 02:01:40,260
Autism Speaks used to be on the bandwagon with that too.

2680
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:41,260
I know, I know.

2681
02:01:41,260 --> 02:01:42,260
All right, anyway.

2682
02:01:42,260 --> 02:01:44,260
I'm sure we could do a whole…

2683
02:01:44,260 --> 02:01:46,260
We have a show full of three-hour shows tonight,

2684
02:01:46,260 --> 02:01:48,260
but I do want to move on for now.

2685
02:01:48,260 --> 02:01:51,260
But, hey, if nothing else, the people listening tonight

2686
02:01:51,260 --> 02:01:53,260
maybe learned something tonight, so.

2687
02:01:53,260 --> 02:01:56,260
Won't make the same booboo as Niantic.

2688
02:01:56,260 --> 02:01:59,260
So, anyhow, let's move on with some more news stories.

2689
02:01:59,260 --> 02:02:02,260
Just a couple more, actually, and then we're going to get to the Skype line

2690
02:02:02,260 --> 02:02:04,260
at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2691
02:02:04,260 --> 02:02:06,260
And this may actually be the…

2692
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:08,260
No, I think we'll still have Skype next week

2693
02:02:08,260 --> 02:02:11,260
because I'll probably just use the iPad to work around it.

2694
02:02:11,260 --> 02:02:14,260
But Skype's sadly a daze with our show.

2695
02:02:14,260 --> 02:02:15,260
Maybe a little bit numbered.

2696
02:02:15,260 --> 02:02:16,260
We'll see.

2697
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:17,260
Anyway, for now, for now, for now.

2698
02:02:17,260 --> 02:02:21,260
I'm not saying that we won't have a way to take calls one way or another.

2699
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:23,260
If I have to bring back the 800 number and do that whole thing,

2700
02:02:23,260 --> 02:02:26,260
then we'll do it that way, but we'll work on that.

2701
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:28,260
Anyway, for now, Loki.

2702
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:31,260
So, there's this massive Fallout mod that's been released

2703
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:35,260
called Fallout New Californians, a mod for Fallout New Vegas.

2704
02:02:35,260 --> 02:02:39,260
And it's finished, and you can play it now, so go check it out.

2705
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:44,260
Apparently it's been a project that's been in the works for about six years now.

2706
02:02:44,260 --> 02:02:48,260
They have a ton of content in this.

2707
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:53,260
There's 42 missions in the game, 13 different endings.

2708
02:02:53,260 --> 02:02:56,260
Depending on your play style, it'll take about six to eight hours

2709
02:02:56,260 --> 02:02:59,260
to 15 to 30 hours if you're a completionist.

2710
02:02:59,260 --> 02:03:04,260
The play's almost 17,000 lines of dialogue spoken by…

2711
02:03:04,260 --> 02:03:10,260
They said about 15,000 of those, which are spoken by 60 volunteer voice actors.

2712
02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:13,260
Yeah, so it's awesome.

2713
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:17,260
So if you're interested in checking it out, go to moddb.com slash mods slash

2714
02:03:17,260 --> 02:03:23,260
Fallout Project Brazil, and you'll find Fallout New California.

2715
02:03:23,260 --> 02:03:25,260
I'm thinking about checking this out.

2716
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:26,260
Yeah, it sounds like fun.

2717
02:03:26,260 --> 02:03:30,260
Because I'm not picking up Fallout 76, so maybe.

2718
02:03:30,260 --> 02:03:33,260
A different way to experience Fallout in the next few days, I suppose.

2719
02:03:33,260 --> 02:03:34,260
Yeah.

2720
02:03:34,260 --> 02:03:39,260
Alright, I got one more Twitter fuckup for you guys to close out the news tonight,

2721
02:03:39,260 --> 02:03:41,260
and I'm sure you guys have heard of this one.

2722
02:03:41,260 --> 02:03:45,260
This one's shitty. There's really no way around this one.

2723
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:50,260
It comes from goodoldgames.com, or GOGcom as they're known on Twitter.

2724
02:03:50,260 --> 02:03:53,260
They wrote a tweet earlier this week that said,

2725
02:03:53,260 --> 02:03:57,260
classic PC games hashtag won't be erased on our watch.

2726
02:03:57,260 --> 02:04:00,260
Yeah, how's that for some use of hashtags?

2727
02:04:00,260 --> 02:04:03,260
And they deleted that tweet, and the reason why that was a shitty tweet

2728
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:09,260
is because hashtag won't be erased is a Twitter hashtag that has been used a lot

2729
02:04:09,260 --> 02:04:13,260
by the trans community in response to a lot of the news

2730
02:04:13,260 --> 02:04:18,260
that has come out of our government about how basically the president

2731
02:04:18,260 --> 02:04:23,260
and some advice counselor, I don't know all the legal names of things,

2732
02:04:23,260 --> 02:04:28,260
but in a nutshell, the president and the people around him want to

2733
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:34,260
basically legal define his two genders that are defined by, you know,

2734
02:04:34,260 --> 02:04:37,260
what's in your pants, and it's gross.

2735
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:44,260
And I want any trans folks out there listening to know that I support you.

2736
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:47,260
You're valid. This is bullshit.

2737
02:04:47,260 --> 02:04:50,260
And that's why I think it pissed a lot of people off

2738
02:04:50,260 --> 02:04:54,260
when GOGcom decided to make a joke out of it, you know?

2739
02:04:54,260 --> 02:04:58,260
I mean, the second sentence there, yeah, how's that for some use of hashtags?

2740
02:04:58,260 --> 02:05:04,260
Fuck off. Like, how dare you? Go fucking sell games.

2741
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:09,260
Like, do you think you're fucking edgy like Wendy's or Arby's or something?

2742
02:05:09,260 --> 02:05:12,260
That's not edgy. That is not, like, this is very-

2743
02:05:12,260 --> 02:05:14,260
That's cunty.

2744
02:05:14,260 --> 02:05:18,260
One way. But, I mean, this is a serious issue that, you know,

2745
02:05:18,260 --> 02:05:21,260
this is not the time. Like, if you want to look at, like,

2746
02:05:21,260 --> 02:05:24,260
how to, like, be ruffle feathers or whatever on Twitter,

2747
02:05:24,260 --> 02:05:28,260
go look up Wendy's account or something. Wendy's would not do something stupid like that.

2748
02:05:28,260 --> 02:05:30,260
Well, at least I hope they wouldn't. You know what I mean?

2749
02:05:30,260 --> 02:05:33,260
So, it was just, oh, it was really gross.

2750
02:05:33,260 --> 02:05:39,260
And what makes it worse, like, it would be one thing if this is the first time this has happened.

2751
02:05:39,260 --> 02:05:41,260
But it's not the first time this has happened.

2752
02:05:41,260 --> 02:05:46,260
So, the social media team at Good Old Games and CD Projekt Red,

2753
02:05:46,260 --> 02:05:51,260
which this all kind of runs up to, is they run the Good Old Games.

2754
02:05:51,260 --> 02:05:53,260
And, of course, they're making the Cyberpunk 2077,

2755
02:05:53,260 --> 02:05:56,260
which was where one of the other bad tweets came from, was that account.

2756
02:05:56,260 --> 02:06:02,260
The social management at this team, like, needs, like, a good, hard, scolding, probably firing,

2757
02:06:02,260 --> 02:06:07,260
but, you know, some serious education on how to conduct themselves online

2758
02:06:07,260 --> 02:06:09,260
and what is and what isn't appropriate.

2759
02:06:09,260 --> 02:06:12,260
And there's a lot of people calling for some serious change over there.

2760
02:06:12,260 --> 02:06:18,260
Or they're going to pay for it in other ways, such as the fact that, as a result of this,

2761
02:06:18,260 --> 02:06:24,260
the makers of Journey Quest, Zombie Orpheus, cancelled their contract with Good Old Games.

2762
02:06:24,260 --> 02:06:30,260
They, as soon as, you know, this happened again, they basically said, the CEO Ben Dobbins said,

2763
02:06:30,260 --> 02:06:34,260
quote, the harm that hate speech does to people who are under immense threat from governments,

2764
02:06:34,260 --> 02:06:37,260
private individuals and corporations is incalculable.

2765
02:06:37,260 --> 02:06:41,260
It's downright sociopathic to demean our friends and allies in this way.

2766
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:44,260
There's absolutely nothing funny about any of it.

2767
02:06:44,260 --> 02:06:48,260
And that's the same reason why I won't buy any of the Witcher games or that new Cyberpunk game coming out.

2768
02:06:48,260 --> 02:06:51,260
That company has done the same shit, too.

2769
02:06:51,260 --> 02:06:58,260
Yeah, well, I mean, I would be a little more comfortable buying that stuff because here's the thing.

2770
02:06:58,260 --> 02:07:03,260
Like, the social media team is bonkers crazy with this stuff.

2771
02:07:03,260 --> 02:07:07,260
I don't want that to invalidate necessarily the hard work of all these people that are making the game,

2772
02:07:07,260 --> 02:07:09,260
the hundreds of other people.

2773
02:07:09,260 --> 02:07:14,260
But that social media stuff needs to change and it needs to be communicated to us how it's going to change.

2774
02:07:14,260 --> 02:07:16,260
And if that doesn't happen, then we have no other choice.

2775
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:23,260
But I'm not going to give my money to a company that thinks it's OK to do that.

2776
02:07:23,260 --> 02:07:24,260
And honestly, I...

2777
02:07:24,260 --> 02:07:29,260
Right, and they need to come out in very plain language and not these runaround tweets.

2778
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:34,260
They come out in very plain language and say how it's going to be different, in my opinion.

2779
02:07:34,260 --> 02:07:39,260
I'm not going to support a company that allows that, even for the sake of the employees, I'm sorry.

2780
02:07:39,260 --> 02:07:44,260
Because they're just going to, if we keep doing that, they're going to keep doing that shit.

2781
02:07:44,260 --> 02:07:46,260
You have to vote with your money.

2782
02:07:46,260 --> 02:07:47,260
Fair enough.

2783
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:50,260
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

2784
02:07:50,260 --> 02:07:53,260
SSJ100Matt says, GOG needs to delete their account.

2785
02:07:53,260 --> 02:07:55,260
That would be a good resolution as well.

2786
02:07:55,260 --> 02:07:58,260
Dungeonbuster in chat says, I was pretty shocked when I read this story.

2787
02:07:58,260 --> 02:08:02,260
And dartitsuya says, I remember that one about Cyber 2077 months ago.

2788
02:08:02,260 --> 02:08:04,260
It was probably the same asshole.

2789
02:08:04,260 --> 02:08:06,260
Yeah, so...

2790
02:08:06,260 --> 02:08:10,260
If you're going to do social media, like, remember you are representing a whole company.

2791
02:08:10,260 --> 02:08:15,260
And stop being edgy for clicks.

2792
02:08:15,260 --> 02:08:18,260
And if, like, don't...

2793
02:08:18,260 --> 02:08:23,260
Like, if you're going to be edgy, do it the way Wendy's does it by talking shit about McDonald's.

2794
02:08:23,260 --> 02:08:24,260
That's funny.

2795
02:08:24,260 --> 02:08:26,260
This? Not funny.

2796
02:08:26,260 --> 02:08:28,260
So, anyway.

2797
02:08:28,260 --> 02:08:31,260
What's your favorite Wendy's tweet?

2798
02:08:31,260 --> 02:08:33,260
I don't know.

2799
02:08:34,260 --> 02:08:40,260
Probably, you know, the most famous tweet of all time or the most retweeted was the guy that asked for the chicken nuggets from Wendy's.

2800
02:08:40,260 --> 02:08:43,260
I guess that was as annoying as that whole thing, I think, ended up becoming.

2801
02:08:43,260 --> 02:08:46,260
I think that was a pretty epic thing on Wendy's behalf. I don't know.

2802
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:49,260
What happened with that? Did he get his chicken nuggets?

2803
02:08:49,260 --> 02:08:51,260
I think he did get his chicken nuggets, yeah.

2804
02:08:51,260 --> 02:08:58,260
But he actually tweeted Wendy's and was like, how many for free McNuggets, or not McNuggets, but whatever, just free nuggets for life or whatever.

2805
02:08:58,260 --> 02:09:01,260
And Wendy's said it was, I don't know, 18 million.

2806
02:09:01,260 --> 02:09:02,260
And he got, like, really close.

2807
02:09:02,260 --> 02:09:04,260
And Wendy's, I think, gave him the free nuggets anyway.

2808
02:09:04,260 --> 02:09:09,260
And I'm sure it was all done on the Ellen show, because that's how these things always resolve themselves.

2809
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:13,260
Anyway.

2810
02:09:13,260 --> 02:09:16,260
We are going to open up the Skype line right now.

2811
02:09:16,260 --> 02:09:18,260
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2812
02:09:18,260 --> 02:09:24,260
If you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight, or perhaps something else, while we wait to see if any calls come in.

2813
02:09:24,260 --> 02:09:26,260
I don't know if we have any last minute stories.

2814
02:09:26,260 --> 02:09:41,260
There was some pictures of some prototypes that apparently Microsoft's been working on as far as controllers that would attach to some sort of phone or tablet device to go along with this whole streaming service that they were going to be doing, the Project X cloud.

2815
02:09:41,260 --> 02:09:46,260
So they have some prototypes that show, like, some controller things that look neat.

2816
02:09:46,260 --> 02:09:50,260
I mean, looks like they might be comfy.

2817
02:09:51,260 --> 02:09:54,260
It kind of reminds me a little bit of, like, the Switch dock a little bit.

2818
02:09:54,260 --> 02:10:00,260
Because they have, you know, basically this piece that goes in the middle that you put the two halves into to charge it.

2819
02:10:00,260 --> 02:10:03,260
And they would just clip on the side of your phone or whatever.

2820
02:10:05,260 --> 02:10:07,260
I could see that, I guess.

2821
02:10:07,260 --> 02:10:10,260
So curious where Microsoft's going to go for their next console.

2822
02:10:10,260 --> 02:10:14,260
I wonder if they're really going to try to do something a little more radical with their next console.

2823
02:10:14,260 --> 02:10:18,260
Like, you know, how, like, Nintendo did the whole, you know, take it anywhere you go type of thing.

2824
02:10:18,260 --> 02:10:22,260
Like, what is Microsoft going to try to do something that really sells that ecosystem with PC?

2825
02:10:22,260 --> 02:10:25,260
Or, like, what are they going to do for their next consoles?

2826
02:10:25,260 --> 02:10:30,260
Because I think we all expect that PlayStation 5 is just going to be, like, more PlayStation 4, but, like, more parts.

2827
02:10:30,260 --> 02:10:32,260
You know, that whole type of thing.

2828
02:10:32,260 --> 02:10:35,260
You know, maybe VR integrated a little more or something.

2829
02:10:35,260 --> 02:10:41,260
But, you know, it's interesting to guess where Microsoft's going to go next.

2830
02:10:41,260 --> 02:10:43,260
I'm just curious where everything's going to go.

2831
02:10:43,260 --> 02:10:46,260
Because, I don't know.

2832
02:10:46,260 --> 02:10:50,260
You know, we'll probably have it all figured out by the time we get to episode 1,000.

2833
02:10:50,260 --> 02:10:53,260
Probably will.

2834
02:10:53,260 --> 02:11:00,260
Who would have thought that the MECO is going to take over the market and become the dominating force of everything?

2835
02:11:00,260 --> 02:11:02,260
Who would have thought?

2836
02:11:02,260 --> 02:11:04,260
Who would have thought?

2837
02:11:04,260 --> 02:11:07,260
Do you think this show's going to get to 1,000 episodes?

2838
02:11:07,260 --> 02:11:08,260
Probably.

2839
02:11:08,260 --> 02:11:10,260
How many years is it going to take to do 200?

2840
02:11:10,260 --> 02:11:11,260
That's about five more years of episodes.

2841
02:11:11,260 --> 02:11:13,260
So we've got five more years left in us?

2842
02:11:13,260 --> 02:11:14,260
Yeah.

2843
02:11:14,260 --> 02:11:16,260
What the hell?

2844
02:11:16,260 --> 02:11:20,260
We have to make sure all the kids are old enough to take over the show properly once we're done.

2845
02:11:20,260 --> 02:11:26,260
We have to make sure, like, Julian, whoever else's kids wants to come in, take over the show.

2846
02:11:26,260 --> 02:11:29,260
That they're, like, 18 and they're good to take it over.

2847
02:11:29,260 --> 02:11:31,260
So.

2848
02:11:31,260 --> 02:11:34,260
Fuck if I won't let those kids take over the show.

2849
02:11:34,260 --> 02:11:39,260
Over my dead body!

2850
02:11:39,260 --> 02:11:40,260
Let's see.

2851
02:11:40,260 --> 02:11:45,260
Oh, Mega Man X400 says, I tried calling on Skype and it doesn't seem like it's working.

2852
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:46,260
Uh oh, that's not good.

2853
02:11:46,260 --> 02:11:48,260
We should let Midna and Smoosh do the show.

2854
02:11:48,260 --> 02:11:50,260
Let me.

2855
02:11:50,260 --> 02:11:52,260
I'm going to restart Skype.

2856
02:11:52,260 --> 02:11:54,260
Actually, one thing I always do is I try to call for my phone.

2857
02:11:54,260 --> 02:11:56,260
I'm going to try calling for my phone and see if that works.

2858
02:11:56,260 --> 02:11:59,260
And then if it doesn't, I'll give it a good old trusty reboot.

2859
02:11:59,260 --> 02:12:01,260
This is going to be meh.

2860
02:12:01,260 --> 02:12:02,260
Meh.

2861
02:12:02,260 --> 02:12:07,260
So, in Google Fit news, apparently it's not compatible with the Fitbit.

2862
02:12:07,260 --> 02:12:09,260
So they can fuck right off because.

2863
02:12:09,260 --> 02:12:10,260
Really?

2864
02:12:10,260 --> 02:12:11,260
How the fuck am I going to track?

2865
02:12:11,260 --> 02:12:14,260
You have two apps open to track mileage?

2866
02:12:14,260 --> 02:12:15,260
Fuck that shit.

2867
02:12:15,260 --> 02:12:17,260
Seriously.

2868
02:12:17,260 --> 02:12:20,260
Okay, yeah, I just called the Skype line and it worked fine.

2869
02:12:20,260 --> 02:12:25,260
Just make sure you're using Orange Launch Radio, all one word, on Skype.

2870
02:12:25,260 --> 02:12:27,260
And it should work.

2871
02:12:27,260 --> 02:12:29,260
But we'll see.

2872
02:12:29,260 --> 02:12:32,260
But I did call a test just now and it worked.

2873
02:12:32,260 --> 02:12:34,260
Any other stories you want to get to, Loki?

2874
02:12:35,260 --> 02:12:43,260
There's speculation that the PlayStation 5 will have a built-in VR functionality to let players track their movement without an external device.

2875
02:12:43,260 --> 02:12:44,260
Hmm.

2876
02:12:44,260 --> 02:12:48,260
So, apparently according to some patent information.

2877
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:49,260
Interesting.

2878
02:12:49,260 --> 02:12:51,260
That's neat, I guess.

2879
02:12:51,260 --> 02:12:57,260
There was an exploit in Grand Theft Auto 5 that allowed hackers to kill people in single player.

2880
02:12:58,260 --> 02:13:01,260
If you're connected to Rockstar Social Club.

2881
02:13:01,260 --> 02:13:10,260
Because apparently they were hacking using the admin tools that apparently they had super user powers that could do all sorts of shenanigans.

2882
02:13:10,260 --> 02:13:12,260
And that did get patched out, thankfully.

2883
02:13:12,260 --> 02:13:14,260
But it was a thing.

2884
02:13:14,260 --> 02:13:18,260
Yeah, multiplayer mode is no fun to be fucking around with on that stuff.

2885
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:20,260
But this was single player though, this was not multiplayer mode.

2886
02:13:20,260 --> 02:13:21,260
Oh, I thought it was multiplayer mode.

2887
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:23,260
This was in single player that people were getting hacked.

2888
02:13:23,260 --> 02:13:24,260
Yikes.

2889
02:13:24,260 --> 02:13:25,260
If they were, you know, online.

2890
02:13:25,260 --> 02:13:26,260
Oh dear.

2891
02:13:26,260 --> 02:13:29,260
So, yeah, not fun there either.

2892
02:13:29,260 --> 02:13:31,260
Glad they closed that out.

2893
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:34,260
Yooka-Laylee's getting a 64-bit mode.

2894
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:39,260
It's gonna look like Nintendo 64 or Banjo-Kazooie since, I mean, that is what it's kind of...

2895
02:13:39,260 --> 02:13:41,260
So it's getting a retro filter.

2896
02:13:41,260 --> 02:13:42,260
Inspired by, yeah.

2897
02:13:42,260 --> 02:13:47,260
Retro filter with all of the blurry, low-resolution assets.

2898
02:13:47,260 --> 02:13:48,260
Fantastic.

2899
02:13:48,260 --> 02:13:51,260
So that's kind of neat, I guess.

2900
02:13:52,260 --> 02:13:55,260
Another completely random thought.

2901
02:13:55,260 --> 02:13:57,260
I was looking at release dates coming out.

2902
02:13:57,260 --> 02:14:03,260
And did you know that the same day Smash Brothers comes out on the Switch, Katamari comes out as well.

2903
02:14:03,260 --> 02:14:05,260
Oh no, I didn't realize they shared the same day.

2904
02:14:05,260 --> 02:14:07,260
And it's on PC, so I'm totally picking that bump on PC.

2905
02:14:07,260 --> 02:14:09,260
The Katamari game's on PC.

2906
02:14:09,260 --> 02:14:10,260
It says it's on PC.

2907
02:14:10,260 --> 02:14:11,260
Oh, that's great.

2908
02:14:11,260 --> 02:14:12,260
I'm excited for that.

2909
02:14:12,260 --> 02:14:14,260
Because I'm looking for mods.

2910
02:14:14,260 --> 02:14:15,260
Fuck yeah, new levels.

2911
02:14:15,260 --> 02:14:16,260
Hell yes.

2912
02:14:16,260 --> 02:14:18,260
Yeah, they're gonna mod the shit out of that.

2913
02:14:19,260 --> 02:14:20,260
Other people will fucking support that shit.

2914
02:14:20,260 --> 02:14:22,260
They'll break that shit apart and make it awesome.

2915
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:24,260
Oh, that's really exciting about PC.

2916
02:14:24,260 --> 02:14:26,260
We rolling up giant dicks in no time.

2917
02:14:26,260 --> 02:14:30,260
What to do, mods on PC or portability on Switch?

2918
02:14:30,260 --> 02:14:32,260
It's hard to decide.

2919
02:14:32,260 --> 02:14:37,260
You buy the Switch version, then you wait for the sale on PC because Switch games never fucking go on sale.

2920
02:14:37,260 --> 02:14:38,260
Okay.

2921
02:14:38,260 --> 02:14:39,260
You can just do that and you get both.

2922
02:14:39,260 --> 02:14:40,260
Alright.

2923
02:14:40,260 --> 02:14:41,260
That's some critical thinking.

2924
02:14:41,260 --> 02:14:42,260
I like that.

2925
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:46,260
Dark Sakura, when are we gonna get to see you next here in studio?

2926
02:14:46,260 --> 02:14:47,260
Another fourth Sunday.

2927
02:14:47,260 --> 02:14:48,260
Another fourth Sunday.

2928
02:14:48,260 --> 02:14:49,260
Alright.

2929
02:14:49,260 --> 02:14:50,260
We'll see.

2930
02:14:50,260 --> 02:14:53,260
Well, I think, I don't know if Skype is broken or what.

2931
02:14:53,260 --> 02:14:56,260
Even though I just did a test call, it worked fine.

2932
02:14:56,260 --> 02:14:57,260
Something must be going on.

2933
02:14:57,260 --> 02:15:01,260
So it's nice to see Skype on Windows XP going out with a whimper.

2934
02:15:01,260 --> 02:15:02,260
Oh, and then of course.

2935
02:15:02,260 --> 02:15:03,260
Here on episode 750.

2936
02:15:03,260 --> 02:15:08,260
With us, there was a big ol' 4chan Smash Brothers rumors thing this week.

2937
02:15:08,260 --> 02:15:15,260
You know, allegedly there was artwork, marketing artwork that was leaked,

2938
02:15:15,260 --> 02:15:18,260
showing the full banner with all the characters in there.

2939
02:15:18,260 --> 02:15:21,260
It's crazy the amount of investigation.

2940
02:15:21,260 --> 02:15:25,260
The blurry guesses based on what they saw.

2941
02:15:25,260 --> 02:15:34,260
Shadow, the Hedgehog, Banjo-Kazooie, Isaac, Ken, Mock Rider, Geno, and Chorus Kids.

2942
02:15:34,260 --> 02:15:35,260
We'll see.

2943
02:15:37,260 --> 02:15:38,260
I mean, coming from 4chan.

2944
02:15:38,260 --> 02:15:39,260
Come on.

2945
02:15:39,260 --> 02:15:40,260
Come on.

2946
02:15:41,260 --> 02:15:42,260
We're only a few months away.

2947
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:44,260
Alright.

2948
02:15:44,260 --> 02:15:45,260
We'll just wait and see.

2949
02:15:46,260 --> 02:15:47,260
I know, that's where my head is at.

2950
02:15:47,260 --> 02:15:52,260
Is it like, you know, oh they've got these, you know, leaks and things and all this analysis.

2951
02:15:52,260 --> 02:15:54,260
There's been so many fake leaks anyways.

2952
02:15:54,260 --> 02:15:59,260
Remember the whole Rayman leaked in with the last version of Smash that Rayman was gonna be in the game?

2953
02:15:59,260 --> 02:16:05,260
Is it really going to change your perception on if you're gonna buy the game or not?

2954
02:16:05,260 --> 02:16:09,260
Like, are you really gonna change your mind based on these last character leaks?

2955
02:16:09,260 --> 02:16:10,260
No.

2956
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:12,260
Like, you know, all the people whooping and hollering.

2957
02:16:12,260 --> 02:16:15,260
If Geno isn't in the game, I'm not gonna buy it.

2958
02:16:15,260 --> 02:16:16,260
It's like, yeah right.

2959
02:16:16,260 --> 02:16:17,260
Yeah right.

2960
02:16:18,260 --> 02:16:20,260
Hey, we got a call coming in.

2961
02:16:20,260 --> 02:16:24,260
I'm sure this person is helping us test the line or something, but let's see.

2962
02:16:24,260 --> 02:16:26,260
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2963
02:16:26,260 --> 02:16:27,260
Who's this?

2964
02:16:27,260 --> 02:16:28,260
I think it works.

2965
02:16:28,260 --> 02:16:29,260
It does work.

2966
02:16:29,260 --> 02:16:30,260
I knew it worked.

2967
02:16:30,260 --> 02:16:31,260
I don't know what's going on.

2968
02:16:31,260 --> 02:16:32,260
Hey Bobby, how you doing?

2969
02:16:32,260 --> 02:16:33,260
I'm doing well.

2970
02:16:33,260 --> 02:16:34,260
How are you?

2971
02:16:34,260 --> 02:16:35,260
Good.

2972
02:16:35,260 --> 02:16:37,260
It's the host of the one and only Bobby Blackwell Show here on our show.

2973
02:16:37,260 --> 02:16:38,260
That's right.

2974
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:39,260
That's right.

2975
02:16:39,260 --> 02:16:42,260
We'll let us in at the end of your show, but it's nice to have you here, especially

2976
02:16:42,260 --> 02:16:44,260
on a big episode number like this.

2977
02:16:44,260 --> 02:16:45,260
Yes.

2978
02:16:45,260 --> 02:16:46,260
Yes.

2979
02:16:46,260 --> 02:16:47,260
750.

2980
02:16:47,260 --> 02:16:48,260
This was a momentous episode.

2981
02:16:48,260 --> 02:16:49,260
It was.

2982
02:16:49,260 --> 02:16:50,260
Just because.

2983
02:16:50,260 --> 02:16:51,260
It was.

2984
02:16:51,260 --> 02:16:52,260
They're all momentous episodes.

2985
02:16:52,260 --> 02:16:53,260
Very special.

2986
02:16:53,260 --> 02:16:54,260
We did a lot of special things.

2987
02:16:54,260 --> 02:16:55,260
Yes.

2988
02:16:55,260 --> 02:16:56,260
What's on your mind tonight?

2989
02:16:56,260 --> 02:16:57,260
Nothing.

2990
02:16:57,260 --> 02:17:00,260
I'm actually just trying to get stuff to work on Windows 10.

2991
02:17:00,260 --> 02:17:04,260
Because trying to get a microphone to work with no delay, that's the thing that kills

2992
02:17:04,260 --> 02:17:05,260
me.

2993
02:17:05,260 --> 02:17:06,260
Oh yeah.

2994
02:17:06,260 --> 02:17:08,260
That's the thing that's always made me nervous about the Windows 10 upgrade is the whole

2995
02:17:08,260 --> 02:17:15,260
delay and all that stuff, but there's a whole, but then money and that you're locked into

2996
02:17:15,260 --> 02:17:18,260
one system, but garage band is better.

2997
02:17:18,260 --> 02:17:20,260
I don't know for what we do with live.

2998
02:17:20,260 --> 02:17:21,260
I don't think it is.

2999
02:17:21,260 --> 02:17:22,260
If this were taped.

3000
02:17:22,260 --> 02:17:23,260
Absolutely.

3001
02:17:23,260 --> 02:17:25,260
It would work great for life.

3002
02:17:25,260 --> 02:17:26,260
Yeah.

3003
02:17:26,260 --> 02:17:27,260
Yeah.

3004
02:17:27,260 --> 02:17:29,260
Especially with the, with the, with the Twitch and all that other stuff.

3005
02:17:29,260 --> 02:17:30,260
I don't know.

3006
02:17:30,260 --> 02:17:31,260
It's gonna be the right option.

3007
02:17:31,260 --> 02:17:33,260
I know how to make it all work.

3008
02:17:33,260 --> 02:17:34,260
Come up with a proposal.

3009
02:17:34,260 --> 02:17:35,260
We'll look into it.

3010
02:17:35,260 --> 02:17:36,260
All right.

3011
02:17:36,260 --> 02:17:39,260
Kajudo in chat says, my mic never delayed on Windows 10.

3012
02:17:39,260 --> 02:17:41,260
I, I think it's because this is the onboard one.

3013
02:17:41,260 --> 02:17:44,260
Cause like I'm seeing like other things that are like, well, if you use a different sound

3014
02:17:44,260 --> 02:17:49,260
card, so I may like when I build a new machine, actually put like a special, a different sound

3015
02:17:49,260 --> 02:17:51,260
card in there and that may help.

3016
02:17:51,260 --> 02:17:53,260
Cause that's what I've got in my Windows 7 machine.

3017
02:17:53,260 --> 02:17:54,260
Yeah.

3018
02:17:54,260 --> 02:18:00,260
So, so, and I don't think my work would let me use my Mac laptop for this type of stuff

3019
02:18:00,260 --> 02:18:02,260
because that's the only Mac I have.

3020
02:18:02,260 --> 02:18:03,260
Yeah.

3021
02:18:03,260 --> 02:18:04,260
Yeah.

3022
02:18:04,260 --> 02:18:09,260
Um, and I was going to say, um, Oh, uh, with the, the, with all the windows stuff I was

3023
02:18:09,260 --> 02:18:13,260
looking into, I was going to look at getting a USB sound blaster.

3024
02:18:13,260 --> 02:18:18,260
Cause my last idea was getting a laptop, you know, because they make laptops that are beefier

3025
02:18:18,260 --> 02:18:20,260
than what we run OLR on now.

3026
02:18:20,260 --> 02:18:25,260
So get a laptop, use an, uh, USB, uh, sound blaster card with it.

3027
02:18:25,260 --> 02:18:30,260
Get kind of redo the mixing board to go all digital with it and a little more cause we

3028
02:18:30,260 --> 02:18:31,260
can probably scale it down.

3029
02:18:31,260 --> 02:18:35,260
We have like a full on like music, like mixing board.

3030
02:18:35,260 --> 02:18:37,260
It probably doesn't need to be as good as what we have.

3031
02:18:37,260 --> 02:18:39,260
Kind of scale that back and make it digital.

3032
02:18:39,260 --> 02:18:42,260
And I think it, I think it'll be great for, um, OLR.

3033
02:18:42,260 --> 02:18:43,260
Yeah.

3034
02:18:43,260 --> 02:18:45,260
I'm looking at all this stuff too.

3035
02:18:45,260 --> 02:18:46,260
Yeah.

3036
02:18:46,260 --> 02:18:50,260
So it's going to be, uh, going to be some big changes ahead, but, uh, hopefully we'll

3037
02:18:50,260 --> 02:18:52,260
be able to get that settled in the next month or so.

3038
02:18:52,260 --> 02:18:55,260
Probably it's something I'm going to be looking to do during like the Thanksgiving break.

3039
02:18:55,260 --> 02:18:56,260
So we'll see.

3040
02:18:56,260 --> 02:18:57,260
Yeah.

3041
02:18:57,260 --> 02:18:59,260
And everybody's like, my mic didn't delay in windows 10.

3042
02:18:59,260 --> 02:19:00,260
What's happening?

3043
02:19:00,260 --> 02:19:05,260
What happens is like when I'm listening to it with headphones, cause I like to hear my

3044
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:11,260
own levels, uh, in windows seven, it's, I just hear myself and it's not, it doesn't

3045
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:12,260
mess me up or anything.

3046
02:19:12,260 --> 02:19:17,260
I'm like, I'm just a little louder in my ears, which is great in windows 10 and windows eight

3047
02:19:17,260 --> 02:19:18,260
actually.

3048
02:19:18,260 --> 02:19:22,260
Cause my laptop is windows eight still cause I never upgraded it to 10 cause it couldn't.

3049
02:19:22,260 --> 02:19:24,260
I didn't have hardware drivers for it.

3050
02:19:24,260 --> 02:19:28,260
It would be just, it's like not even a full second off.

3051
02:19:28,260 --> 02:19:30,260
It's like maybe like a fourth of a second.

3052
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:32,260
It's like 200 milliseconds maybe.

3053
02:19:32,260 --> 02:19:36,260
That's when it would come back and it's just enough of an echo to mess with you.

3054
02:19:36,260 --> 02:19:37,260
Yeah.

3055
02:19:37,260 --> 02:19:38,260
Yeah.

3056
02:19:38,260 --> 02:19:40,260
And we have, I mean like here in studio, we don't use headphones.

3057
02:19:40,260 --> 02:19:44,260
We actually have like speakers, but technically our own voices go out through the speakers.

3058
02:19:44,260 --> 02:19:46,260
Thankfully there's no lag.

3059
02:19:46,260 --> 02:19:49,260
So it just kind of sounds like our voices are amplified here in the room a little bit,

3060
02:19:49,260 --> 02:19:53,260
but it's how we hear you guys on Skype and the various onboard noises and those very

3061
02:19:53,260 --> 02:19:57,260
limited places where we do like YouTube's or let's say the intro, I guess the intro

3062
02:19:57,260 --> 02:20:00,260
is something that's every week, you know, or the little music beds that happen over

3063
02:20:00,260 --> 02:20:01,260
classic of the week.

3064
02:20:01,260 --> 02:20:04,260
We can hear all that in studio and that kind of helps us a lot.

3065
02:20:04,260 --> 02:20:05,260
Yeah.

3066
02:20:05,260 --> 02:20:07,260
And Kajudo says, you know, use virtual audio cables.

3067
02:20:07,260 --> 02:20:08,260
You can set the delay.

3068
02:20:08,260 --> 02:20:12,260
The problem is you can't delay it back in time.

3069
02:20:12,260 --> 02:20:16,260
You can delay it forward in time, but not necessarily back in time.

3070
02:20:16,260 --> 02:20:21,260
So if virtual audio cables doesn't get it until a hundred milliseconds after it's

3071
02:20:21,260 --> 02:20:25,260
come out of your mouth, there's nothing it can do to make it go back a hundred milliseconds.

3072
02:20:25,260 --> 02:20:26,260
Right.

3073
02:20:26,260 --> 02:20:29,260
Unless you're the doctor.

3074
02:20:29,260 --> 02:20:31,260
Which may be the only way.

3075
02:20:31,260 --> 02:20:32,260
Yeah.

3076
02:20:32,260 --> 02:20:37,260
So it's a fun, but like music producers have this issue all the time.

3077
02:20:37,260 --> 02:20:41,260
And so they've been talking about this because it's very hard to do karaoke like this.

3078
02:20:41,260 --> 02:20:42,260
Yes.

3079
02:20:42,260 --> 02:20:43,260
For instance.

3080
02:20:43,260 --> 02:20:47,260
And, you know, anybody that tries to like record music has these kind of issues.

3081
02:20:47,260 --> 02:20:51,260
And I know Mac is better on this stuff, but I can't afford a Mac.

3082
02:20:51,260 --> 02:20:55,260
So and I've got a Mac here and I'm sure it would work great, but my work would really

3083
02:20:55,260 --> 02:20:57,260
get upset at me for using my Mac.

3084
02:20:57,260 --> 02:20:59,260
You have to separate work and play.

3085
02:20:59,260 --> 02:21:02,260
I know people though who do all their stuff off Mac minis.

3086
02:21:02,260 --> 02:21:06,260
I'm running Logic Pro X.

3087
02:21:06,260 --> 02:21:10,260
So just, and I already own a copy, so.

3088
02:21:10,260 --> 02:21:11,260
What was it?

3089
02:21:11,260 --> 02:21:14,260
I was looking in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

3090
02:21:14,260 --> 02:21:18,260
Tigerclaw does point out that the virtual audio cable is good for audio, but not for video.

3091
02:21:18,260 --> 02:21:22,260
So, and that's obviously an important direction for the future of what we're doing as well.

3092
02:21:23,260 --> 02:21:26,260
So it's got to be able to do both, which is what we're looking into.

3093
02:21:26,260 --> 02:21:27,260
So.

3094
02:21:27,260 --> 02:21:30,260
I was trying to set something up to stream tonight from that machine.

3095
02:21:30,260 --> 02:21:34,260
And I'm not sure if it's done yet or not, but I finally like, I'm like, okay, I don't

3096
02:21:34,260 --> 02:21:38,260
monitor myself when I'm streaming video, so it'll be fine.

3097
02:21:38,260 --> 02:21:42,260
But I hadn't actually hooked up one of my good mics to this machine yet.

3098
02:21:42,260 --> 02:21:43,260
So I was trying to play around with that.

3099
02:21:43,260 --> 02:21:45,260
I'm like, can I get the delay done?

3100
02:21:45,260 --> 02:21:47,260
Because this is a fast enough computer.

3101
02:21:47,260 --> 02:21:50,260
Why don't you tell us a little bit about the stream after the show tonight, even though

3102
02:21:50,260 --> 02:21:53,260
I know it's a podcast and they'll miss it.

3103
02:21:53,260 --> 02:21:55,260
Please pimp your stream.

3104
02:21:55,260 --> 02:21:59,260
So I was considering if I can get everything set up, and I don't have, because I haven't

3105
02:21:59,260 --> 02:22:03,260
hooked up this camera to it yet, and I finally got that working.

3106
02:22:03,260 --> 02:22:08,260
Yeah, Windows 10 thankfully turns off all the privacy on your microphone and your camera,

3107
02:22:08,260 --> 02:22:10,260
so other apps can't access it.

3108
02:22:10,260 --> 02:22:12,260
It's off by default, or at least it was for me.

3109
02:22:12,260 --> 02:22:16,260
So I'm like, why can't I see my webcam in OBS?

3110
02:22:16,260 --> 02:22:17,260
And that's why.

3111
02:22:17,260 --> 02:22:19,260
So, pro tip if you can't get it working.

3112
02:22:19,260 --> 02:22:24,260
But I just got Forza Horizon 4 on my PC up here.

3113
02:22:24,260 --> 02:22:30,260
So I've been playing it in 4K on the Xbox One, but I've got it on the PC, so I think

3114
02:22:30,260 --> 02:22:35,260
I may be able to stream it tonight, and if anybody wants to Horizon Convoy or something,

3115
02:22:35,260 --> 02:22:40,260
we can meet up in Discord or something and try to do some multiplayer.

3116
02:22:40,260 --> 02:22:42,260
I tried to do some multiplayer.

3117
02:22:42,260 --> 02:22:48,260
I jumped into Brad from PodCulture's game, and he immediately was like, no, I don't play

3118
02:22:48,260 --> 02:22:49,260
online with other people.

3119
02:22:49,260 --> 02:22:52,260
And so I was like, okay.

3120
02:22:52,260 --> 02:22:55,260
Well, you can play however you want to play, that's right.

3121
02:22:55,260 --> 02:22:56,260
Yep.

3122
02:22:56,260 --> 02:22:59,260
He's like, I didn't realize I was online, and he just went offline.

3123
02:22:59,260 --> 02:23:00,260
Yep.

3124
02:23:00,260 --> 02:23:03,260
What was I going to say with all that stuff too?

3125
02:23:03,260 --> 02:23:09,260
Oh, make sure of course you're following Bobby over on Twitch, and I need to level myself

3126
02:23:09,260 --> 02:23:13,260
up on Forza to get all to that stuff, because I've kind of slacked on Forza 4.

3127
02:23:13,260 --> 02:23:14,260
Yeah, I'm still not going there yet either.

3128
02:23:14,260 --> 02:23:19,260
Yeah, so I'll probably need to play some of that this week to at least unlock that stuff.

3129
02:23:19,260 --> 02:23:21,260
We could probably still do an adventure mode thing or something, I don't know.

3130
02:23:21,260 --> 02:23:22,260
Yeah, maybe.

3131
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:23,260
I don't know if I'll be around tonight.

3132
02:23:23,260 --> 02:23:25,260
I think I'm doing an errand after the show, so.

3133
02:23:25,260 --> 02:23:29,260
But, I wish you success with your stream, and of course, you know, thanks.

3134
02:23:29,260 --> 02:23:33,260
I know you haven't been there for all 750 episodes, but honestly, you've been there

3135
02:23:33,260 --> 02:23:37,260
for the majority of them, and it's always fantastic having you around, Bobby.

3136
02:23:37,260 --> 02:23:38,260
Thank you.

3137
02:23:38,260 --> 02:23:39,260
You're welcome.

3138
02:23:39,260 --> 02:23:41,260
Best of luck with your show, and we'll talk to you next week.

3139
02:23:41,260 --> 02:23:42,260
All right.

3140
02:23:42,260 --> 02:23:43,260
Just not on Skype and Windows XP.

3141
02:23:43,260 --> 02:23:44,260
No.

3142
02:23:44,260 --> 02:23:45,260
All right.

3143
02:23:45,260 --> 02:23:46,260
Later.

3144
02:23:46,260 --> 02:23:47,260
Yeah.

3145
02:23:47,260 --> 02:23:48,260
All right.

3146
02:23:48,260 --> 02:23:49,260
Let's see.

3147
02:23:49,260 --> 02:23:51,260
I wanted to get to a question in our chat room, because Mega Man X or Delvin was trying

3148
02:23:51,260 --> 02:23:52,260
to get in.

3149
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:57,260
He couldn't, so he wanted to ask a question kind of like over this, so I'll get to this.

3150
02:23:57,260 --> 02:24:00,260
He says, I guess I will ask my question here to you guys.

3151
02:24:00,260 --> 02:24:07,260
What are your guys' thoughts on the increase in IRL streams on Twitch?

3152
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:11,260
With TwitchCon this weekend, I was able to watch a few people streaming from there, and

3153
02:24:11,260 --> 02:24:12,260
I felt like I...

3154
02:24:12,260 --> 02:24:13,260
Excuse me.

3155
02:24:13,260 --> 02:24:14,260
I felt like I was there.

3156
02:24:14,260 --> 02:24:15,260
LOL.

3157
02:24:15,260 --> 02:24:18,260
I should have watched more streams from TwitchCon.

3158
02:24:18,260 --> 02:24:22,260
I didn't even think to do that, but again, I was really busy yesterday, so I didn't really

3159
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:23,260
have time to do it either.

3160
02:24:23,260 --> 02:24:29,260
What do you guys think about watching IRL streams and how IRL is really growing a presence

3161
02:24:29,260 --> 02:24:31,260
on Twitch?

3162
02:24:31,260 --> 02:24:33,260
I don't know quite what you mean by IRL.

3163
02:24:33,260 --> 02:24:34,260
Like real life stuff?

3164
02:24:34,260 --> 02:24:35,260
Yeah.

3165
02:24:35,260 --> 02:24:36,260
Non-gaming.

3166
02:24:36,260 --> 02:24:37,260
Yeah.

3167
02:24:37,260 --> 02:24:38,260
Non-gaming.

3168
02:24:38,260 --> 02:24:39,260
Like people...

3169
02:24:39,260 --> 02:24:40,260
ASMR is really growing.

3170
02:24:41,260 --> 02:24:43,260
So here's the funny thing.

3171
02:24:43,260 --> 02:24:46,260
When I first did my experimental stream, I was like, okay, I'm going to stream myself

3172
02:24:46,260 --> 02:24:49,260
playing DDR, so I did it with my phone using the Twitch app.

3173
02:24:49,260 --> 02:24:50,260
Guess what?

3174
02:24:50,260 --> 02:24:52,260
You can only do IRL crap in there.

3175
02:24:52,260 --> 02:24:55,260
You can't categorize the stream as gaming, so I had to do...

3176
02:24:55,260 --> 02:25:01,260
I think I did like dancing or something, because there was no way for me to say, I'm playing

3177
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:03,260
a fucking game, you asshole.

3178
02:25:03,260 --> 02:25:05,260
Like put game on here.

3179
02:25:05,260 --> 02:25:09,260
But yeah, you can only do IRL stuff on there, so I don't know.

3180
02:25:09,260 --> 02:25:14,260
I don't watch any of this stuff, but neat, I guess.

3181
02:25:14,260 --> 02:25:16,260
I mean, I could see myself like...

3182
02:25:16,260 --> 02:25:21,260
Eventually when I get set up, it'd be fun to build Legos and shit on stream, and I know

3183
02:25:21,260 --> 02:25:22,260
people do that.

3184
02:25:22,260 --> 02:25:24,260
They'll put together sets and stuff, and that would be fun.

3185
02:25:24,260 --> 02:25:25,260
I'd be down for that.

3186
02:25:25,260 --> 02:25:28,260
I used to draw on livestream.

3187
02:25:28,260 --> 02:25:33,260
I'm not the biggest fan of like a talking head just sitting there reading their chat

3188
02:25:33,260 --> 02:25:34,260
and answering questions.

3189
02:25:34,260 --> 02:25:35,260
I don't like...

3190
02:25:35,260 --> 02:25:38,260
I don't think that content is particularly compelling for me.

3191
02:25:38,260 --> 02:25:41,260
I know there's a lot of feeds that do that, and if you're having success with that, good

3192
02:25:41,260 --> 02:25:42,260
for you.

3193
02:25:42,260 --> 02:25:44,260
It's just not compelling for me.

3194
02:25:44,260 --> 02:25:47,260
But I am loving the game show stuff, right?

3195
02:25:47,260 --> 02:25:51,260
I mentioned a few weeks ago we had Buzzer is really growing over on Twitch.

3196
02:25:51,260 --> 02:25:55,260
That's something I really like to watch, so I like the TV stuff that's growing more and

3197
02:25:55,260 --> 02:25:56,260
more.

3198
02:25:56,260 --> 02:25:58,260
We do have another call coming in, so I do want to get to it.

3199
02:25:58,260 --> 02:25:59,260
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3200
02:25:59,260 --> 02:26:00,260
Who's this?

3201
02:26:00,260 --> 02:26:01,260
Hey, what's going on, everyone?

3202
02:26:01,260 --> 02:26:02,260
It is Ranma.

3203
02:26:02,260 --> 02:26:03,260
Hey, Ranma.

3204
02:26:03,260 --> 02:26:04,260
It's good to hear from you.

3205
02:26:04,260 --> 02:26:05,260
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

3206
02:26:05,260 --> 02:26:06,260
It's good to hear from Oli.

3207
02:26:06,260 --> 02:26:09,260
We have an entire squad back together, you know?

3208
02:26:09,260 --> 02:26:12,260
Like, live concert, one-night-only type, you know?

3209
02:26:12,260 --> 02:26:13,260
I like my laser discs.

3210
02:26:13,260 --> 02:26:14,260
Thank you.

3211
02:26:14,260 --> 02:26:15,260
You're welcome.

3212
02:26:15,260 --> 02:26:16,260
It is.

3213
02:26:16,260 --> 02:26:20,260
It's a bummer we can't do this every week, but I mean, life sucks sometimes.

3214
02:26:20,260 --> 02:26:21,260
It is what it is.

3215
02:26:21,260 --> 02:26:23,260
We work around the challenges life gives us.

3216
02:26:23,260 --> 02:26:24,260
I know.

3217
02:26:24,260 --> 02:26:29,260
I mean, I've been doing my show via Skype for like the last five years, and we do have

3218
02:26:29,260 --> 02:26:32,260
to rotate people out here and there, so you know.

3219
02:26:32,260 --> 02:26:33,260
We just roll with it.

3220
02:26:33,260 --> 02:26:35,260
Yep, you gotta roll with it.

3221
02:26:35,260 --> 02:26:36,260
A couple of things.

3222
02:26:36,260 --> 02:26:37,260
I'll be on my merry little way.

3223
02:26:37,260 --> 02:26:41,260
Number one, I'm a former band geek.

3224
02:26:41,260 --> 02:26:42,260
Nice.

3225
02:26:42,260 --> 02:26:44,260
You're in good company.

3226
02:26:44,260 --> 02:26:49,260
I played the trombone from grade four to seven.

3227
02:26:49,260 --> 02:26:50,260
Okay, good call.

3228
02:26:50,260 --> 02:26:54,260
That's around, I played the clarinet from around six to twelve.

3229
02:26:54,260 --> 02:26:58,260
Good lord, you don't want to know how long I was doing band.

3230
02:26:58,260 --> 02:26:59,260
Your whole life.

3231
02:26:59,260 --> 02:27:03,260
I started on alto sax in sixth grade.

3232
02:27:03,260 --> 02:27:07,260
Moved on to contra alto clarinet in seventh grade.

3233
02:27:07,260 --> 02:27:10,260
Played tenor sax, alto clarinet, contra alto clarinet.

3234
02:27:10,260 --> 02:27:15,260
Went into jazz band in college and played in symphony for three years.

3235
02:27:15,260 --> 02:27:17,260
I was at the University of South Alabama.

3236
02:27:17,260 --> 02:27:18,260
Nerd.

3237
02:27:18,260 --> 02:27:21,260
And then I moved right here, and my saxophone got destroyed in Hurricane Katrina.

3238
02:27:21,260 --> 02:27:22,260
Oh, that's depressing.

3239
02:27:22,260 --> 02:27:28,260
Yeah, I loaned it to somebody who was a wind major.

3240
02:27:28,260 --> 02:27:29,260
Bastards.

3241
02:27:29,260 --> 02:27:31,260
How dare they?

3242
02:27:31,260 --> 02:27:37,260
Well, I mean, you know, it's not much you can do about the hurricane, but my clarinet is long gone.

3243
02:27:37,260 --> 02:27:40,260
I think it ended up going to one of my nieces who doesn't even talk to me, so whatever.

3244
02:27:40,260 --> 02:27:43,260
Whatever is what it is.

3245
02:27:43,260 --> 02:27:48,260
I was about to say the same thing, but moving right along with the whole Skype thing.

3246
02:27:48,260 --> 02:27:53,260
Oh, good lord almighty.

3247
02:27:53,260 --> 02:27:55,260
What? What are you having a laugh about?

3248
02:27:55,260 --> 02:27:59,260
Just laughing from what you're stressing with.

3249
02:27:59,260 --> 02:28:02,260
I lived it, and it was not fun.

3250
02:28:02,260 --> 02:28:08,260
When Microsoft said Skype 7 was being discontinued, I'm like, okay.

3251
02:28:08,260 --> 02:28:13,260
I had to find out all of my stuff, which version of Windows everybody's running, and figure shit out.

3252
02:28:13,260 --> 02:28:19,260
And I'm like, let's try doing this show on Discord.

3253
02:28:19,260 --> 02:28:25,260
Within the first ten minutes of it live, the lag was just atrocious.

3254
02:28:25,260 --> 02:28:30,260
During the musical break, we jumped back onto Skype and just rolled with it.

3255
02:28:30,260 --> 02:28:37,260
Because at that time, they were still trying to make Skype 8 a little bit nicer, a little bit better.

3256
02:28:37,260 --> 02:28:40,260
But now it's good.

3257
02:28:40,260 --> 02:28:46,260
The only thing is that it automatically adjusts your volume when you're talking.

3258
02:28:46,260 --> 02:28:50,260
And I keep disabling that, but it turns itself back off.

3259
02:28:50,260 --> 02:28:54,260
I hate that. Why do things turn themselves back on?

3260
02:28:55,260 --> 02:29:02,260
I will say this. When I play back the episode in the edits, it's solid going across, so I can't complain.

3261
02:29:02,260 --> 02:29:09,260
I know some podcasters are going to Discord, and Discord actually has a robot out there that you can download.

3262
02:29:09,260 --> 02:29:14,260
It's not an official Discord thing, but it'll actually help you record podcasts, which is interesting.

3263
02:29:14,260 --> 02:29:18,260
It's not great for live, but for the recorded stuff, it's another option.

3264
02:29:18,260 --> 02:29:21,260
Had. My other podcast, we used that.

3265
02:29:21,260 --> 02:29:26,260
Come to find out, I wasn't getting links to the episodes that they were recording.

3266
02:29:26,260 --> 02:29:29,260
Come to find out, the people running that bot shut it down.

3267
02:29:29,260 --> 02:29:31,260
Oh no.

3268
02:29:31,260 --> 02:29:39,260
Yeah, so now if I can't record the show, whoever's on it has to either fire up Audition or Audacity to record it.

3269
02:29:39,260 --> 02:29:44,260
Dump it to me in OneDrive or Dropbox, and I do the edits and upload.

3270
02:29:44,260 --> 02:29:56,260
But I will say this. When you're going to Windows 10 and Skype, you may have to definitely switch to a USB mixer or a USB sound card.

3271
02:29:56,260 --> 02:30:03,260
Because I notice with a lot of regular sound cards, when recording, it doesn't pick up both sides of the conversation.

3272
02:30:05,260 --> 02:30:07,260
I mean, but it's not that bad.

3273
02:30:07,260 --> 02:30:13,260
I know, but do you see why I've been stuck on Windows XP this whole time? Because it works. It works for what I need it for.

3274
02:30:13,260 --> 02:30:22,260
I know, but when you're not trying to shill, not trying to shill, when you step into 10, you're going to be like, why haven't I not done this before?

3275
02:30:22,260 --> 02:30:30,260
Uh, maybe. I'll be more like, everything is different in herp derp technology.

3276
02:30:30,260 --> 02:30:36,260
Well, you have my number. You know you can message me or call me anytime and I'll give you that text support.

3277
02:30:36,260 --> 02:30:38,260
I know. Anytime about anything?

3278
02:30:38,260 --> 02:30:40,260
Oh, you know it, baby.

3279
02:30:41,260 --> 02:30:43,260
Uh, Rob, anything else in your mind tonight?

3280
02:30:43,260 --> 02:30:52,260
Uh, no, that's it. No, that's basically it. I'm just getting ready for the work week and how we do, you know.

3281
02:30:52,260 --> 02:30:56,260
Alright, well best of luck. At least you got Halloween this week, so something to mix it up a little.

3282
02:30:56,260 --> 02:30:59,260
Halloween and three bottles of booze in the freezer.

3283
02:30:59,260 --> 02:31:02,260
Sounds good. Alright, take care my friend. I'm going to let you go.

3284
02:31:02,260 --> 02:31:04,260
You too. And Rob, stay fabulous.

3285
02:31:04,260 --> 02:31:06,260
I always do.

3286
02:31:06,260 --> 02:31:08,260
That's what I'm talking about, honey.

3287
02:31:08,260 --> 02:31:10,260
Bye.

3288
02:31:10,260 --> 02:31:15,260
Alright, I think that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight and we're going to wrap up the show tonight.

3289
02:31:15,260 --> 02:31:20,260
As we always say though at the end of OLR, if you enjoyed what you heard, please tell a friend or two about the show.

3290
02:31:20,260 --> 02:31:27,260
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if the voices are here to air out there and spread around the world.

3291
02:31:27,260 --> 02:31:32,260
So, please help us spread the word of Orange D'Andrea because clearly we're not going away anytime soon.

3292
02:31:33,260 --> 02:31:40,260
Thank you as always again for listening and participating with the show tonight, whether it was live here at the Voice Gees Network or via our podcast feed.

3293
02:31:40,260 --> 02:31:45,260
A nice five star review wherever you found this show at a place like iTunes or wherever you're listening to this show.

3294
02:31:45,260 --> 02:31:51,260
Those go a very long way, so please help us out. We would really appreciate it with some good reviews for OLR.

3295
02:31:52,260 --> 02:32:00,260
Dark Sakura, thank you for being here tonight. Missed having you live in studio, although many people don't realize you're actually in studio.

3296
02:32:00,260 --> 02:32:08,260
You're just not here Sunday nights. You're usually here on Friday or something, making some magic with the radio.

3297
02:32:08,260 --> 02:32:11,260
It was nice to have you here on a Sunday night.

3298
02:32:11,260 --> 02:32:17,260
It's good to be back. I'm just really kind of tired of how my schedule is working.

3299
02:32:17,260 --> 02:32:18,260
Yeah, I understand.

3300
02:32:18,260 --> 02:32:19,260
We'll see what happens.

3301
02:32:19,260 --> 02:32:23,260
But look at you. You're a career girl and things are moving in the direction you want to.

3302
02:32:23,260 --> 02:32:25,260
February is when our next change is, so we'll see what happens.

3303
02:32:25,260 --> 02:32:28,260
Fingers and toes crossed. Well, any final thoughts for our listeners in the meantime?

3304
02:32:28,260 --> 02:32:31,260
Um, your cat's loud.

3305
02:32:31,260 --> 02:32:34,260
I know. Did you just hear Alan yelling?

3306
02:32:34,260 --> 02:32:35,260
Shut up.

3307
02:32:35,260 --> 02:32:37,260
That's good.

3308
02:32:37,260 --> 02:32:41,260
I gotta go to the grocery store too to get butter for more cookies.

3309
02:32:42,260 --> 02:32:49,260
More cookies. My final thought tonight is thank you, Dark Sakura, for the Girl Scout Cookie Thin Mint Coffee.

3310
02:32:49,260 --> 02:32:52,260
Yes, the moment I saw that, I was like, heck yeah.

3311
02:32:52,260 --> 02:32:54,260
Fantastic. And just what I needed this evening.

3312
02:32:54,260 --> 02:32:55,260
Awesome.

3313
02:32:55,260 --> 02:32:57,260
Last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?

3314
02:32:57,260 --> 02:33:03,260
My final thought is, I guess I'm going to try to figure out how to install Fourth Mix Plus on my machine this week.

3315
02:33:03,260 --> 02:33:10,260
And I'm going to work on my step mania setup to also get that installed at some point.

3316
02:33:10,260 --> 02:33:19,260
And then, um, follow me on Twitch. Twitch.tv slash Loki O-L-R.

3317
02:33:19,260 --> 02:33:20,260
Alright.

3318
02:33:20,260 --> 02:33:23,260
So we can get that affiliate status for some reason.

3319
02:33:23,260 --> 02:33:24,260
For biddies.

3320
02:33:24,260 --> 02:33:25,260
For biddies, I guess.

3321
02:33:25,260 --> 02:33:27,260
They just gave it to me for no reason.

3322
02:33:27,260 --> 02:33:28,260
Because you're special.

3323
02:33:28,260 --> 02:33:32,260
But I'll be streaming tomorrow, hopefully. Yeah, I've been trying to stream every day.

3324
02:33:32,260 --> 02:33:38,260
Like, Friday, this is my, I guess I'm just not used to, because I've been playing more difficult songs.

3325
02:33:38,260 --> 02:33:43,260
I've been playing heavy songs, which I may cut back on that a little bit, because I've been failing a lot of that shit.

3326
02:33:43,260 --> 02:33:50,260
Because especially doing, like, I'm not used to playing for like an hour straight playing, you know, heavy non-stop songs.

3327
02:33:50,260 --> 02:33:52,260
Because it's four songs in a row, just non-stop.

3328
02:33:52,260 --> 02:34:00,260
Like in the other day, I had like, hey, it's Paranoid Evolution, followed by somewhat of an easier song, followed by, you know, um.

3329
02:34:00,260 --> 02:34:02,260
Oh god, what the fuck was it?

3330
02:34:02,260 --> 02:34:07,260
It was, um, some other fucking hard Fifth Mix song.

3331
02:34:07,260 --> 02:34:14,260
Um, so I was just like, okay, I can't, like, I literally feel like my heart's gonna explode at some point.

3332
02:34:14,260 --> 02:34:18,260
So not to die on stream, I have to stop what I'm doing.

3333
02:34:18,260 --> 02:34:19,260
Good call.

3334
02:34:19,260 --> 02:34:20,260
You know.

3335
02:34:20,260 --> 02:34:22,260
But, so, let me kick it back a little bit easier.

3336
02:34:22,260 --> 02:34:25,260
But, Fourth Mix, you know, there's gonna be plenty to go through.

3337
02:34:25,260 --> 02:34:30,260
Um, I don't know if I'll have it installed tomorrow, but, um, I'll read up on it.

3338
02:34:30,260 --> 02:34:32,260
I still have to burn the disc for it, so.

3339
02:34:32,260 --> 02:34:42,260
Well, actually, I technically have Fourth Mix, I think I actually have a legit Fourth Mix, plus I have almost all the mixes in a box next to the machine that you can't see off-screen.

3340
02:34:42,260 --> 02:34:46,260
But, um, I could probably reinstall those, but.

3341
02:34:46,260 --> 02:34:47,260
Alright.

3342
02:34:47,260 --> 02:34:48,260
Superdisc.

3343
02:34:48,260 --> 02:34:49,260
Alright, uh, that's it.

3344
02:34:49,260 --> 02:34:53,260
We're gonna see you in seven days, and we'll do this all over again with another episode of OLR.

3345
02:34:53,260 --> 02:34:57,260
Until then, happy gaming, have a safe week, and don't be a dick to people online.

3346
02:34:57,260 --> 02:34:58,260
Bye.
