Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Strike one down and another two pop up in its place

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
That's the story of how PUBG has banned 13 million accounts and counting

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
Cheaters and scammers know no bounds, but we've got better news of new content coming soon

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Stay tuned for this and plenty more starting right now on the show, wherever Gamer has a voice

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
Live tonight, episode number 747 for this, October the 7th, 2018

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here in Sacramento, California

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Studio N7, where our show is based

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
Live for the next few hours, talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
With you guys in our live chat, as well as my co-hosts here in studio, say hello to Loki

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Hello

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
How are you, Loki?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I'm good

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Good, you're eating Korean BBQ on the show tonight

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Yes

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
Yes, which is not something you usually get, because I thought Korean BBQ was very expensive

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
It is

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
There must be something very specific you were craving tonight

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
It's the bulgogi beef, but the problem is though, the bulgogi that you get with Takeout

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
Is not the same as the bulgogi that you cook at a Korean BBQ

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
It's like, it's thicker, it's covered with tons of barbecue teriyaki sauce

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
This was dry

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
Thankfully I ordered an extra side of teriyaki sauce

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Thank gosh, thank gosh

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
So

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
That's funny because you had Korean BBQ, I had bulgogi BBQ

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
So it's like BBQ city tonight

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
And then a couple nights ago, I had Lucille's BBQ, the more southern BBQ type of stuff

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Mmm

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
BBQ

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
We've just seen a BBQ fusion restaurant

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
That's right, there's BBQ with some orange entrees tonight

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
All of the BBQ

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
All of the BBQ, anyway

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Dark Sakura, she is still out on leave

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
She'll be joining us a little later in the show for the Classic Game of the Week

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
But we do have someone else here in studio with us tonight

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
To help us along with Dark Sakura's absence

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
I'm very happy to welcome him to the show because I know he's been listening for a while

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
And he has a show of his own which is fantastic

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
And he came a very long way to be here

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
So all the way from Toronto, say hello everybody to Delvin

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Hello

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
How are you?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
I'm really good

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
So you have a show called Video Game Realness

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
That is correct

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Well it's not your show, you're your friends

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Yeah, it's a group of friends

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
It's a group of friends that all do it together

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Tell us a little bit about Video Game Realness

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
So we started about 5 years ago I want to say now

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
You see a boat

02:40.000 --> 02:50.000
And so, yeah, 5 years ago it's me, one of my old roommates Cameron and my two friends James and Michael

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
We just shoot the shit talking about video games because we used to do it all the time

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Going to dinner and stuff

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
One day we just decided let's just put this on tape and record it

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
This sounds so familiar

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Doesn't this sound familiar, Loki?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Yeah

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
So yeah, we

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
No, I love it

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
We just get together, talk about video games

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
It's usually quite random and quite stupid and silly but that's just how we are

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
Yeah, actually I loved, you know, again I would encourage folks to go listen to Video Game Realness

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Although I notice your episodes are kind of sporadic

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Yes

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
You just kind of do them when you feel like it

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
Yeah, we're on a regular schedule but, you know, life gets in the way and now we just do it when there's something to talk about

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
I respect that, I respect that but I will say, not to give away all your jokes

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
But on the most recent episode, something that had me rolling, you already know this

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
Was you guys were talking about the new Switch game that's coming out, Starlink

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Yes

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Which is Ubisoft's game

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Yes

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
But we keep seeing all these in the trailers and in the Nintendo Directs

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
They're like, Star Fox is in Starlink

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Yeah

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
So finish this joke here

03:56.000 --> 04:03.000
So basically, every time Nintendo talks about the game, they pretty much promote it as a Star Fox game

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Right

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
And I don't know what the game's about

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
I mean, they might kind of say it by Ubisoft, you know, they just kind of like skim over the details

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Yeah

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
Yeah, so there's this comic out there, James had shared it with our group

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
I don't know the origin of the comic but basically it's like in three parts or whatever

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
Where someone had basically, was handing something to someone saying, I made this, right?

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
And then, but the person takes it and then says, no, I made this

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
So basically we considered this the same situation with Starlink

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Right

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
Where Ubisoft has made the game and Nintendo has now just taken it and said, no, I made this

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
You made this? I made this

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Yeah, yeah, just slapped Star Fox in there and now it's just Star Fox

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
That's right

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Like, who knows what the game's about

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
The question is, is the game any good?

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Who knows, who cares, it's a Star Fox game

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
It's a Star Fox game now

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
How dare you, don't ask these questions

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
Because all of the Nintendo tie-ins have been successful, you know, just like they did with what, the last Skylanders game

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Did you buy it because it had Nintendo tie-ins in it?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
No

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
No, no, I didn't

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Because no one gives a shit about that

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
I sure did

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
And this is another choice of life game with a Nintendo tie-in that

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
You know what else I didn't buy was the one with Gamelan on Philips CD-i

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
So not every Nintendo crossover is successful, but some are kind of cool, so you never know

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
We'll see where this one goes, but I think it's pretty much a Star Fox game

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
With some other characters

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
I made this

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
You don't know

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
I'll let video game realness hold the joke, I'll stop stealing it

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
They could have one of Gamelan, Link as a, you know, echo fighter in the next Smash Brothers game

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
I just, I think there's like a sense of pride that would never be violated by doing that in Smash Brothers

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
I really think so, I think Nintendo would really rather forget that ever happened

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Or Linkette

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Stop it right now

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Alright, anyway

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
Because like I said earlier, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
vognetwork.com

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
And going into our chat room, Tigerclaw says

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Starling on the Switch is basically a new Star Fox game

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
That's exactly what Nintendo wants you to think

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
It's not

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Please, stop making excuses for them

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
They need to make their own Star Fox game

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
I made this, I made this

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
However though, I'm completely fine with them not making their own F-Zero game

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Because when it was Nintendo and Namco, that turned out just fine

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
Oh, that was the Triforce, that was Sega as well, wasn't that too

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
Yes, because Sega and Namco both know racing games, Nintendo, they have F-Zero

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Nintendo makes great characters, alright anyway

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
Tigerclaw says what's interesting though, in the cutscenes that show Star Fox, or excuse me, Fox with a human

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
Fox is pretty short, he looks to be about 4 feet tall next to a human

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
And S.J. 100 Matt is calling out a few minutes in and Loki is already going after Nintendo

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
And which I oppose is sorry I'm late

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Anyway, Delvin, I don't mean to take the spotlight off of you and video game realness

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
So you've been listening, I know, to OLR for a little while, which you know, thank you very much

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
But we got connected back when GamerX was kind of like coming up

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Correct

07:06.000 --> 07:13.000
Because we were trying to find other LGBTQIA plus, you know, all the colors of the rainbow

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
We were trying to find people to kind of connect with to propose a podcasting panel at GamerX

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
Which we did end up doing, but sadly you guys didn't make it to GamerX

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Yeah, we couldn't make it out to the

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
But at least we still got connected, so that was the important part

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
That was the win in that situation, which was really cool

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Yeah, so that was a while ago now

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Because they did four years of GamerX and the last GamerX was like two years ago

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
So that was like six years ago

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Crazy! So awesome

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Tell me a little bit about why you're a gaming fan

07:43.000 --> 07:50.000
What do you remember early on that like a gaming memory that made you a gaming fan?

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
Well, I got into gaming from a very young age

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I think I was five or six

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I got the NES for Christmas

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
And my sister and I, we didn't really know like what a Nintendo was

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
We'd kind of seen it in commercials or whatever

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
And then we got it for Christmas one year

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
And so my parents had this one box that we couldn't open

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
And so they left it there, and then they gave us this one box to open

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
If you open that box, Santa's gonna burn down the house

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah, kinda

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
So they gave us this one box to open and it was a joystick

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
And so we were like, well, why are you giving us a joystick?

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
And then we looked at the box and we just started clawing at it

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
And we were screaming and going crazy

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
And so that was like the moment when gaming started for me essentially

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
And they're like, no, I told you not to open it, now you don't get it

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
And it turns out the joystick was for a lawnmower that was in the box

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Now go do the chores

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
No, it was a Nintendo in there

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
So at that time it was just NES games

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
We only had Mario

08:52.000 --> 08:59.000
But my aunt, who lived in Texas at the time, had sent us a bunch of games from the US

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Because they were a lot cheaper here in the US than it was in Canada

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
And one of those games that she sent was Mega Man 2

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
Which is my most favorite game of all time

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
I was gonna ask that because I know you're a big Mega Man fan

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
Like so much that Mega Man appears in your online presence

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Correct, my gamertag, Mega Man X400

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
So tell us a little bit about this Mega Man love

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Where does that come from?

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
It really just started from Mega Man 2

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
And I've always enjoyed the Mega Man series

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
It took me forever to actually beat Mega Man 2 as a kid

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
And then when I finally got it, it just clicked with me

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
And then that evolved into liking the X series

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Which is my favorite of the Mega Man games

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Which I've played through all of them

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
And they're just really fun

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
And they have great replayability and great challenge

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
You can play it in any which way you like

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
To make it more difficult if you want

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
You can try to speedrun it if you want or just play it for shits and giggles

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
I gotta ask you your thoughts on Mega Man 11

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Although you probably haven't really had to play it yet

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Because you've been out here, right?

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Well I did play the demo

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
I played the demo at Fan Expo

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Which is a big convention in Toronto

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
And so that was a lot of fun playing it there

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
I did get to play some of it on the plane right here

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
And it's great

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Honestly, I think they did a really good job of this game

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
It was long overdue

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Long, long overdue

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
I'm glad that they didn't go in the direction they did with Mega Man 9 and 10

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
With going back to the old retro design

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
They seem to have found a nice hybrid

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Maybe it's not retro, but it looks like the old game

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
They didn't try to make it ultra fancy or force 3D in it

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
No, it has a good style to it

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
It's still in the original Mega Man series

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
But it is not the old Mega Man 2, 3, 4 style

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
With the NES 8-bit style

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
That they did with 9 and 10

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Which I didn't quite like

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
It now has 4 different difficulty levels

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Which I think is really good

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
It has super beginner, casual, normal, and then hardcore

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
Wait a minute, so you got hardcore for ultra

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Is that going to be your mode at some point?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
No, I'm just normal

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
So then you have slightly irritating

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Which is normal

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
That would be your mode

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
So then you have casual

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
And so then we even have below that Bobby Black Wolf mode

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Beginner

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
No, it's ok, he's in on the joke

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
It's fine, it's fine

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
The most basic of basic levels was made for Bobby Black Wolf

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
And it's fine

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
So basically what happens in beginner mode is

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
You almost take no damage

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
And if you fall, a little bird comes and picks you up

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
And puts you onto the next platform

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
So you can just get through the level

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Oh my god, I love it

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
It's super easy

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Ok, that's awesome

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
I know one place maybe some of the OLR listeners may have seen you before

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
If they don't participate with video game realness right now

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
They may be familiar with your Twitch

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Because I know you and I have done co-streams

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
We've done Mario Kart

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
We did Mario Kart and we played 20XX

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Which is not Mega Man

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
I remember when I streamed that game for the first time

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
You came into the chat and you were like

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
What is this?

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
I had no idea about the game until I saw you play it

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
And I purchased it immediately

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
And it is a really good game

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
And I generally don't like the

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Roguelike style of gaming

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Where you have to start all over again

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
But they do this one in a really good way

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
That incorporates the Mega Man style of playing

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
In with a roguelike

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Which is really good

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
So tell us a little more about your Twitch

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
You're streaming right?

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
So I do stream rather passively right now

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Because there hasn't been very much games to stream

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
But there's a whole slew of games coming out

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Between now and when Smash Brothers comes out

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
So you'll be seeing me stream a lot more

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
On twitch.tv slash vgrealness

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Nice! Love it

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
And by the way Bobby is speaking up in chat

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
He wants us to know

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
I didn't even beat beginner frown

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
There was this one platforming section

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
That was an autoscroller and I could never get through it

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
It was the one with destructible blocks

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Oh yeah I had that trouble too

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Because our Switch controllers

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
My kids busted them

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Well they're not busted

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
But they occasionally drift

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
For no reason

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
No it's not even

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
I don't even think it's the kids that did it

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I think it's just their controllers are pieces of shit

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Is what it is

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
I've actually seen a lot on Twitter about like

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Cleaning those controllers

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
How does dust get in there

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
In a way that affects analogies

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
Because I don't have this problem on any other controller

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Oh and then the other thing that was fun

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Is my kids wanted to play

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Super Mario Party

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
And so you know I thought

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
They had some nice little additional pieces

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
That they have for the joy cons

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
To make them add the little wrist strap

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
And stuff like that

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Those fuckers are nearly impossible to put on

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
And take off

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
I don't use them for that reason

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
What poor fucking design is this shit

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Even when you put them on correctly

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
It's just impossible to take them off

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
They're pretty tight

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Alright anyway what else I want to ask you about

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
New games that you're into

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
So we know about Mega Man

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
What else, I mean I'll get into your gaming week

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
So we can talk about specifics because you know we do that here

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
But like in a general sense what are some of the

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Recent games you've really enjoyed

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
The one that I've

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Played through the most recently was

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Octopath Traveler

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Which I know a lot of people

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
It's kind of a love hate game

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Where you either really got into it because you like that style

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Of game

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
But it is lacking in terms of a continuous story

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
And character development

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
I think it really did

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Have the design sense

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Where it was going to be

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Made for a mobile game

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
That you would purchase in packages

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Based on the characters that you purchased

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I think, was that your show that got into a discussion

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
On that because I think you guys are apps

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I heard that on a podcast somewhere about this game was very

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Clearly designed for mobile

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
And I think that is like on the money

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I think it was on the money

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
And they made efforts to kind of

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Make character development later on

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
But it was very tapped on

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
But that being said, I do love the battle system

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
That is where the heart of the game is

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
And how you can

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Do the battles and customize your

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Jobs

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
And you get like advanced jobs later

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Which just make it even like super easier

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
And just even talking with friends and like

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Finding out how they beep certain bosses

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Versus how I did it and just

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
There's so many different ways in which you can skin the cat

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Basically

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Well don't do that

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
But it's really great

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
And I'm pretty sure Square Enix will make

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
A Octopath Battle 2

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
It ended up selling like

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
It was the best seller that month in the US

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
So I'm sure that game really

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Exceeded expectations in the US

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Specifically

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
So there's gonna be like a Deca path

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
I mean I know Deca is 10

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
But I think we got into this in a previous episode

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
But there's going to be a sequel

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
And that will be good because it will give them a chance to really perfect

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Now this formula I think

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
And the only thing they need to do to make a second game

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Good is just a story that continues

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
And keep everything about the battle system

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
The same because it's

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
That we know is not going to be piecemeal like in the story

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Correct

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Make it a joining story and not just eight

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Individual stories about people that

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Don't connect

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Makes sense

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Awesome

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Please chime in throughout the night

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Tell us what you think about the news

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
And we're just really happy to have you here

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Any social media shout outs to give while you're here?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
You can follow us on our Twitter channel

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Which is at VG Realness and of course I mentioned

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Our Twitch channel

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Twitch.tv slash VG Realness

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
We do have a YouTube channel as well

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Which has like some of our old playthroughs

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Because sometimes we would play games

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Together as all four of us

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Or together

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Sometimes me and James would be playing

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Final Fantasy 14 so all of our old

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Video clips and stuff are on our YouTube

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Channel as well which you can just search

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Video game realness and it's on there

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
They are

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I like to think so

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
I'm curious though

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Am I the first guest you've had

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
From Canada?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
In studio

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Yes

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
I'm pretty sure we've had a Skype guest

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
From Canada

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
But in studio

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I think we had guys from Vancouver

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
But as far as in studio

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Yes

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
I'm pretty confident in saying yeah you're the first one from Canada

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
If I'm wrong

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Dark Tetsuya will correct me shortly

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Because he knows this show better than I do

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Which is fine

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
That's why we have a wiki

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Alright I appreciate that

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
What is the number one thing

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
People in the US should know about Canada

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
We don't all say A in a boot

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
You kind of did though a little bit

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
You definitely said A

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Ok not all of us though

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Maybe I did

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
But not all of us

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
You know what though good point

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Now that I'm thinking about this

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
I have interviewed people at conventions randomly

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
And some of them may have been from Canada

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
But actually sitting in on the show

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
You've got to be the first

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
So SJ100Matt says Canada is great

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
I'm going up to Toronto later this month

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
And says poutine is the one thing we should know

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
I'm actually very thankful

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
That you actually brought with you

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Ketchup chips

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Oh yeah that's right

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
No no no

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Why not they make sense

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
You put ketchup on french fries and hash browns

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
And other potatoes why not put them on chips

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I get it

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
But you know what's funny

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I was explaining this to you last night

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
We just had this hilarious

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
All these stupid differences between the countries

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
But right now for some reason

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
They're selling all dressed chips

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Which we don't usually have in the US

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
But Ruffles or whatever is doing this

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Random ass promotion

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I should have also brought you Smarties

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
The chocolate candy

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Not the little tart things

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
That we associate with

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
So we have Smarties as something different

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Completely in Canada

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
And then I think the things

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
That you call Smarties we call pop rockets

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Or something I can't quite recall

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Because I'm not that candy person

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Alright good to know

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
D'artizia in chat is confirming

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I'm pretty sure he's the first Canadian we know

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
That's actually on the show

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
The ambassador to Canada

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Delvin is here with us tonight

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Yes queen

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Alright let's get into our kickoff topic tonight

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Which has to do with movies movies movies

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Like this week it just seems like

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
All these video games suddenly

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Want to turn into movies

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Loki you want to tell us a little more about

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
What's going on this week with Hollywood's recent

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Obsession with adapting more video games

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
When, correct me if I'm wrong

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Video game adaptations

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Like some have done okay

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
You know like Resident Evil

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
They've made how many of those movies

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Because I think they do very well on Blu Ray

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
And home video and you know cult type of things

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
You know with the horror crowd

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I know there's definitely a huge fandom of Resident Evil

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
And so forth so I think those movies have done

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Okay but like I'm not thinking of like

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
You know how like when there's a big

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Big movie like let's say Titanic

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Right then suddenly Hollywood is like

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
What are all the other disasters in

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
History we need to suddenly make

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
A movie or or um

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Titanic did well well then we need to remake

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
The Poseidon adventure right away

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Right like Hollywood has this

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Obsession with if one thing is big

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
So I'm trying to like

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
They have this obsession with we run out of ideas

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
And so now let's

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Yeah we gotta remake everything

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Scrape that barrel until there's no barrel left

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Although I'm gonna get this off my chest

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Right now because while many of you were

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Seeing Venom in the theaters this weekend

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
My ass was there opening night to see

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
A Star is Born with Lady Gaga

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
The fourth remake of that movie

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
And all I'm gonna say is

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Yes queen

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Well all I'm saying is yes I am

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Seeing Venom next week

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
No I don't really care to see it but it's a

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Free movie my dad wants to hang out so

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Sure

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
There's nothing else playing he's like

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
So you don't wanna go see A Star is Born like no

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
It's so good

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
I cried so much

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
She's queening out

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Anyway no but my point is

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Not every remake

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
But the thing about

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Not to get too far this is a video game show but the thing about

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Star is Born is that

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
The one in the 50's is about

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Hollywood acting this one is very much about

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Music making because obviously that's what Gaga

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Does so it's like Grammys

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
But anyway

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
I can save that for another podcast

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Let's talk about my point with this whole thing

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Was why is Hollywood suddenly obsessed

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
With we've gotta make a video game

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Movie because we have so many of them just coming out

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
I think because they're doing like well this

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Is kind of Konami a little bit you know they're

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Doing I think they have had some

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Success with Castlevania as a series

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
And so now they're like yeah sure

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
You can make our properties into

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Things so like first off we've got Dance Dance

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Revolution being adapted

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
To something

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
What is there to adapt? Look

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Well here's what they're saying and this

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
This is gonna be like

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Real quick real quick cause I wanna address the

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
First question before we move on about like what is

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Hollywood's obsession right now with this

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Tigerclaw says movies based on video games are

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Usually a hit or miss it depends on the source

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Material some video game movies are better than

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Others because they're closer to the source material

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Than others Tomb Raider for example

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
That was a good video game movie I forgot

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
That was pretty recent but I didn't think that

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
One made I mean I didn't see the movie

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
I heard it was actually like decent

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
It was like it didn't it didn't like

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Make a tragedy of the game or anything like it was

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
A good adaptation but I don't think it made

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Shit tons of money

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Like I don't even know if it made its budget back

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
But anyway like that's

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Like a kind of a recent thing that

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Came up so anyway sorry so

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
DDR where are we going with this

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
No we're good

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Unfortunately so basically

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Here is how

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
They summarize it

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
The project will explore a world

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
On the brink of destruction where only

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
The only hope is to unite

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Through the universal language

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Of dance

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Fucking stupid

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Um and since I know

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
A lot of people playing the home game are probably

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Shouting various other movies that

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Have been about DDR in the past

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
We have things like DDR the movie so we have

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
The FP La Machina

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
De Bailar a failed

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
DDR movie script floating around for the 2000s

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
That's what Rama says in chat at live.vognetwork.com

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Um so this isn't necessarily

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
The first movie about DDR

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
But I mean here's the thing like

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
I I'm gonna say something y'all might

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Not like but those movies even though

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
They're DDR inspired they're not

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Dance Dance Revolution the movie

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
They're more about you know

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Community DDR is kind of a plot device

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
So to speak

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
And I'm fine with it being a plot device

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
And honestly this sounds more like something

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
That would you know lend itself better to like

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
An animation or something like some

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Some kid wants a

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
You know make it to like the

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Grand chan- who cares make the stakes

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Lower and just like you know

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Talk about like the community

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Or something but like instead they're going with

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Fucking apocalypse it's always a

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Fucking apocalypse of some sort and

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
This doesn't it doesn't lend

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Itself you can't have like

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Hey guys you know what

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
The step up series is doing fucking great

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Let's make a movie where we

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Save the world from an apocalypse with

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
It's fucking stupid it sounds

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Stupid with an established franchise like that

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
And now we're gonna do something different

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
The only way

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
That Emmy could save the world

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Was to get a triple A on

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Brilliant to You

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
This is what I'm gonna

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Say there's no fucking story in

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
DDR so I don't understand like why they're

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Gonna do movies so in my opinion

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
And that's my opinion is that

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
If they're gonna do a DDR movie

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
It needs to have two things

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
It needs to have some scene where

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Arrows go up the screen if arrows do not

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Go up the screen at some point in the movie

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Fail. Number two that

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Soundtrack better be the

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Cheesiest fucking 90s euro dance

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
I have heard in my entire

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Life because if skill

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Rex is on that album throw it in

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
The garbage

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
My guess is that with

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
The uniting of the world

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
With dance is that it's gonna

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Incorporate different types

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Of music and dance and then the arrows

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Will be the language in which they speak

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
So there will be arrows

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
On the screen but they'll

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
That will be their way of communicating

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Will the arrows make a heart at some point?

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Yes and a giant heart

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
And then it will save the world

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Sailor Moon style

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Like the only way that this is like

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Sounds any like a plausible

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Thing like to use like music to

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Save the world type thing it sounds like

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Matt Cross 7

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Or 2 or I don't remember which

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Matt Cross series they had where I think it was

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
7 where they had like the rock band and

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
They were fighting actually with music and stuff

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Matt Cross 2 I didn't watch any of those I just

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Remember the figures for them

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
So that's the only way I could

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
See that something like that if you want to fight

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
With like music or something but other than that I just don't

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
See how this could be a thing

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
It's gonna be garbage

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
It's a movie called Dance Dance Revolution

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
That might have like

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
One throw it like do you remember

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
When they made a battleship movie?

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
With Rihanna in it

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
I've talked about this on a show before

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
I know I have it was fucking terrible yeah

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
That's the thing I said if that movie

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Did not have a scene with Liam Neeson

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Going you suck my battleship

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Then it's not a battleship game

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
And they have the pegs they have the pegs in there too

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
And that was great I saw it in the trailer

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
I'm like this is stupid but that's the thing

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
You know it's stupid and that's what you

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Go to see is stupid and guess what they're

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Delivering stupid so

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
I will say

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Dance is kind of big right now like

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
That World of Dance show on NBC

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Have you like seen some of that like

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Like I gotta say like some of the

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Like cause you know I love

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Emotional porn on Facebook right

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Like I will watch those auditions

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
With like the little girl that like

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Breaks this on and then all the judges start crying

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
And then I'm crying and we're all crying

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
And it's like 1 am and I'm not in bed yet

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
It's not gonna be that

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
But I'm saying dance is big right now cause that World of Dance show

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Is actually has a lot of that

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
And then what just tonight

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
They've got Dancing with the Stars with

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Little kids for some reason

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
I don't know with Honey Boo Boo

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Dancing with the Stars is tonight

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Oh wait is she actually on it?

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Yeah Honey Boo Boo is on it

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
She must be much older now

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Like what is she grown up all the way

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Yeah but you know gotta get those paychecks

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Still rolling in like you know

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
That show went off the air how many years ago

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
So gotta pay for college

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
That kid will go to any college she wants

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
So anyway

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Dance is big right now so why not

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
I just don't have high expectations

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Whatever the hell they put in the theater so I don't really care

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Sorry I gotta say Bobby Blackwoven

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Chat after I talked about Honey Boo Boo

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Bobby Blackwoven chats like

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Delvin's like well OLR was fun but you

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Got a TV right

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
I love it

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
I love it alright so enough

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Enough Dance Dance Revolution so

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
That may be a thing we'll see

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
I think if it's gonna suck this

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Especially since what? It's like

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
It's not necessarily like

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
This would have been like something to do

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
A decade or so ago

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Like when it was like super popular

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Now it's not super popular

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
You've missed your boat

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Here's the thing and I want you all to know

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
I love dance you might think I'm excited

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
About a DDR movie I'm not

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
I love Dance Dance Revolution

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
This show wouldn't exist if it wasn't for

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
DDR in the community but when I heard

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
The movie the news about the movie and this

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Whole plot and everything I'm that lady

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
In the matrix and you've all seen this

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Youtuber gif I don't remember her name

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
But you see her and she's looking and she knows

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
About to get unplugged she's gonna die she's going

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Not like this not like this

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
And that's how I'm looking

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
At this DDR movie not like

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
This is not where I would not like this

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Anyway

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
What else is gonna get ruined?

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Well let's see the next

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Step on the list is

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Monster Hunter the movie

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Alright Monster Hunter that's a popular

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Series let's see how we're

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Gonna fuck this one up

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Well the movie plot centers

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
On the leader of a UN military

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Team named Artemis played

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Oh but it's got Milaj

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Um Jovanovich so

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Milajovic Jovanovich yeah whatever

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
You know why she's in it

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Because it's just gonna be garbage

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Better than that who's directing it

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Oh her husband

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Yeah so

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Whatever you know what it's fine I can see

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
This being like a schlocky

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
It's a great Hollywood love story

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
If we're gonna flop we're gonna flop together

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
So it's alright

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
It's transported into another realm populated by

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Monsters where she meets a hunter

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Jai

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
With two team

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Or two of them teaming up to close the portal

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
To prevent monsters from attacking Earth

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Doesn't sound like Monster Hunter

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
But you know what though

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Yeah Darkest Season chat says are we sure this is a Monster Hunter movie

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
It's what it is

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
It does have the video game director

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Doing it and it's got the name

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
So

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
I mean there's monsters in it and there might be

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Four people trying to take down the monster

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Honestly though but here's why

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Like think about it this is why that they're gonna

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Let them do this

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Look at how much money Capcom probably made

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
From the Resident Evil movie franchise

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
And let's be honest the Resident Evil movies

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
They're not high caliber

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
They were just

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
They're entertaining popcorn films

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
That's what I see this as

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
That's what I see this as

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Instead of it being zombies

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
It's just gonna be fucking monsters now

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
And it's the same shit

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Because she's a

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
UN military person so it's basically

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Her fucking character from

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
The Resident Evil movies

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Just thrown into a whole other fucking universe

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
With CGI monsters that says

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
CGI zombies

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
I will say out of the movies

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
The games becoming movies Monster Hunter is the one that

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Kinda makes the most sense

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Honestly like if you're gonna make

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
It become a movie like Monster Hunter I'm like

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Okay well that's not like DDR

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
You know that has at least a plot

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Or like some sort of a story

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Monsters being hunted okay

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
I'm with you

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
It's basic but I got it

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Godzilla was a monster being hunted

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Oh good point good point

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Well Hollywood loves a monster movie

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
And of course since

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Capcom's sense is hmm there's

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Money to be made from our franchises

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
We tried Street Fighter that didn't work

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Out so well a few times

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
We are trying uh we tried

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Resident Evil that worked out let's go with that

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Monster Hunter? Possibly

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
How about we fuck over Mega Man

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Again he's not quite dead

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Yet with the animated series

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
No because I'm counting the animated series

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
With that have you watched the animated series?

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Absolutely not it's pretty garbage

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
It's not that bad

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Our Resident Mega Man fan says

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
It's not that bad

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
But it's not that good either

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
That saw that there's a tiny Mega Man

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
That's living inside of Mega Man's head

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Yes I'm sorry that's it's terrible

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
It's fucking garbage

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
It's fucking garbage and like

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
They should do it in a way they're gonna do

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
An animated series of Mega Man and they wanna

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Be silly like that then do it like the

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Fucking Teen Titans series

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
I mean Teen Titans Go just do it like that

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Where it's self

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Referential and just silly

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Oh wait were you talking about the new Mega Man

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
The new one okay sorry no

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
I was referring to the old one

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Oh no no the old one

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
That's fine that was a long time ago we made

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Our mistakes back then

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Yeah I was referring to the old one

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
No I'm talking about the new Mega Man

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
No no no no

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
No new Mega Man series yeah

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
So they're thinking

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
About doing and not necessarily

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
An animated Mega Man series

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
A live action Mega Man

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Film

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
That makes me very nervous

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Based on the influential and globally

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Beloved Mega Man franchise

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Capcom aims to appeal

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
To a diverse audience

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Including not only game players

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
But action movie fans

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
As well you know this

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Is how we get this right here

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Is how we get that prototype of Mega Man

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
That fucking was scrapped and you know the one that looked like

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Bomberman Act Zero that bullshit

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Oh yeah that's how we get this shit

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Yeah I was still

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Watch it though

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Every day I hear about the Sonic the Hedgehog movie

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
I'm just like going

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
I will watch that because Jim Carrey's in it

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
And that's the only reason why

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Is going to be a mess

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Is going to be a mess

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
I'm a little worried when they say live action

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Because immediately I get the picture

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
The cover art of Mega Man 2

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
In my head

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
With the human Mega Man

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
And that just terrifies me to see that

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
But what if that human Mega Man is played by none other than

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Nathan Fillion

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Who's going to play Mega Man?

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Oh I imagine if Mega Man is a boy

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
They're going to get a child actor to play Mega Man

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
And they'll probably humanize

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Like I don't think Mega Man will look so

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Roboty but Mega Man will look like

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
A little kid but maybe with like

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
An arm that shoots lasers

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
We'll get none other than child actor

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Macaulay Culkin

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
He's in his 30s I mean like

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
He was a child actor at one time

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
That's still

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
That's like the whole thing where I'm like wait a minute

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
I'm still voicing Sora

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Okay that's going to be interesting

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Because Sora's going to be very much an adult now

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Because Haley Joel Osment's

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
I don't know if y'all know

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
But since Kingdom Hearts

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
The last game was like 15 years ago

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Haley Joel Osment is not a kid anymore

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
I don't know if y'all know

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
He a very grown man now

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
I don't know if y'all have heard

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
But a lot of those kid actors have grown up

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Like that kid who played Anakin

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
In the first Star Wars movie

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
And he also was like you know what

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Acting is not for me because people are fucking me

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Because you know people were really fucking rude to him

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Because they blamed

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
The failures of episode one on

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
What a seven year old boy

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Because that's a rational thing to do

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Anyway

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Who knows it's George Lucas come on

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Let's see

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Looking in chat over at

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Live.vog at Network.com

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Dungeon Buster says I've seen artists try to make Mega Man

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Look realistic

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
One box art did not turn out well

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
The only positive

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
I think there's a way to make Mega Man not look

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
He just won't look like the robot

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Except maybe in like one scene

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
The only positive I have here

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Because I'm a fan of his as well

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Is that it's being produced

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
I guess

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Along with Masaoka

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Which was the guy from Heroes

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
That was the guy in Heroes

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
He's like kind of helping shape this

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Okay you have my attention

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
He's kind of a geeky guy that I feel

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Has probably actually played Mega Man

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
I played Mega Man

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
So I'm hopeful

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Okay

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Once again though

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
We'll put that in column A

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
I will see it no matter how garbage it is

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Just so I can complain about it

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
I think it has potential

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
To be really good if they

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Went the X series route

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
As opposed to the original Mega Man

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
But it would be weird for them to jump

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
To the X series

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
And not start at the beginning for people who've never

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Played Mega Man before

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
So it's

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Either here or there

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
I think it would actually be

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Like you guys are going to disagree with me

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
But I think it would be very smart of them

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Like if they want to make a good movie

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
They're going to really keep the references to the games

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Very light

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Like there will be a Mega Man

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
There will be a Dr. Light

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
And a Dr. Wily

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
But maybe it's not like

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
You just described the game

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
I know but like it's not like

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Levels

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
It's just going to be like

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Maybe it's like Scott Pilgrim

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
I would be fine with Scott Pilgrim

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Type of movie

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
He's got to find these other kids that are actually

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
The creations of Dr. Wily

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Yeah exactly

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Now that I'd be okay with

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Going to chat at

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Live.vognetwork.com

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
And SS200Matt says at the end they will say

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
He is a Mega Man

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Cause you know we all

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Y'all love it when somebody in the movie

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Says the title of the movie

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Roll credits

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Yeah got it

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
There you go

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Three video game movies

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Coming soon

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Maybe not that soon

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Eventually

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Let's move on into some

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
How was your gaming week and the types of video games

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
That you've been playing this week

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Loki we'll start with you

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
I played Forza Horizon 4

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
So I played through a little bit of that

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
I

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Don't know what I'm

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
I'm probably training my

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Dryvatars badly

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Because I'm not on the roads most of the time

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
I'm just going everywhere else

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
But

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Yeah it's a very pretty game

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
It runs really nice on my laptop

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
So I'm happy about that

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Um

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Then I did play a little bit of

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
DDR

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Ace

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
I went to the arcades actually

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
I've been meaning to go over there and play for like a long time

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
But the problem is it's like so packed over there

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Dave and Busters

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
That can never really get on the machine

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Especially since there's fuckers that like to

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Camp on the machine all day long

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
It's like don't you have school or something?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
I mean like shouldn't you be

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
In a job? I don't know

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
But so I did that

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
And then you know other arcade games with the Golf Land

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Because I had to keep my son

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Away from my other son

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Because my other son was sick

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
And so that means I had to take him out of the house the entire day

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
So that was pretty much

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Saturday all arcade day

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
So we were playing different arcade games

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
I got to play the giant

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Space Invaders game

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Which meh

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Mario Kart was pretty fun

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Played a little bit of that

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
And very sad

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
That I saw the

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
DDR Max 2 machine

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
That's at

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Roosevelt Golf Land

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
And it is a sad, it's off

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
And it's a very sad sight

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
I didn't take Delvin to Golf Land while he's here

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
For a reason, I was just like you know it's skippable

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
It's um

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
The golf course is nice

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
We went and played mini golf, they have it all decorated for Halloween

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
So that's kind of cool

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
The only way to fixing their machines up is

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
They don't give a shit

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
As long as the ticket spitters are working

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Then they don't give a shit about anything else

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
But it was a sad sight

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Do you have mini golf in Canada?

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
We do

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Well then yeah, there's no point

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
And then what else?

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
So

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Pokemon Go

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
And

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Just

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Yeah, that's pretty much it

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
I didn't get the chance to play Super Mario Party

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Because my kids basically have been

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
You know, monopolizing the Switch

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
And

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
I didn't bother to purchase Spiderman

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Because my wife's monopolizing the TV

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
To watch a stupid baking show that she could watch

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Oh, the Great British Bake Off?

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Oh good times, love that show

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
It's a great show, but I wish I could have the TV once in a while

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Has she watched Nailed It?

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Because that's another great one

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
You know what, I set up a TV in our bedroom

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
She's like, I want to watch Netflix in bed

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Okay, cool, set up the old TV in the bedroom

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
With the Netflix box

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Watch your fucking baking show in here

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Then I can play on the 4K TV

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
That we bought with my nice 4K system

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
To play some 4K games

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Nope!

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Gotta fucking watch the goddamn baking show in 4K instead

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
It's like, ugh

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
We need to see every detail on those cakes

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
And they are fucking delicious looking

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
No fault of that show

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
It's just, it's

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
It's everything

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Uh, Delvin, I'll let you go next

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Because I know we have a little bit of overlap

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
So I'll let you, you know, I can always just talk about 4

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
How was your gaming week, Delvin?

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Um, so

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
For the past week and a bit

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Uh, I just recently got back

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Into playing World of Warcraft

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
I'm back on my bullshit again

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Of playing World of Warcraft

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Uh, so

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Any fans listening from

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Video gaming will just know that I

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Swore that I was not going to play

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Uh

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
I'm right there with you

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
I swore, I'm like, nope, not going to play this expansion

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
I'm done, I'm not playing World of Warcraft anymore

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
And then

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
I blame Cameron

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Because he started playing

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
And we're basically, we enable each other

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
One of us will start playing

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
And then enable the other person

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
To start playing

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
It's kind of like the friendship Shane and I have

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
And so

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Not totally his fault, but then another friend

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Was playing too, and I was like, okay, well, fuck

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
The band's getting back together again

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
So I don't want to be the one left out

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Uh, so I got back

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Playing about a week and a half ago

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
And power leveled all the way

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
To 120, and then started

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Grinding through dungeons, mythic bluses

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Raiding, and

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
I'm such a

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Nerd that, you know, the raid

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Resets are on the Tuesday

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Right. So

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Tuesday night, uh

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
I did all my raiding for one week

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Because I was leaving

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Yeah. Wednesday

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
So Tuesday I did

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
All of normal raid

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
And I did a bit of heroic with

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
My guild

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
And did some, like I did everything that I needed to do

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
For the week, I did the mythic plus, so I would get something

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
In my box for the week

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
And all of it

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
And so that was my gaming week mostly

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Um, I also, like I did mention

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Bonds006 says you did not want to be the diva

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Holding out to get the band

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Get together. Exactly. You did not want to be

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Posh Spice. No. You did not want to be the hold out

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Exactly. So I was like

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Whatever. I've been playing for

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Ten years, what's, what's another

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Year? Right? So who cares?

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Um, and uh

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
I did play some Mega Man

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Um, and that, and of course Pokemon Go

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
A lot, uh, we've been playing over

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
The weekend. Yeah, we were hanging with Dark

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Sakura yesterday actually, since obviously

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
She's not available on Sundays, so we kind of spent yesterday

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
With her so you could meet her. Um, and then we

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Ended up, she did not have Mewtwo yet

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
And it was like, me, you, her

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
And Allen like all play, so I was like

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Okay, we have four people together, where's the Mewtwo

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
At? And we're like, maybe somebody will be

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
There if we get there right at Hatch, and sure enough

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
We, and there was this couple, walked

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Right up when we did, and it was like, oh good

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
We were hoping other people would be here, so like between the six

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Of us, actually no, there was a seventh account

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
A mysterious seventh

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Player. Possible Spoofer

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
But thank you Spoofer

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Yeah, cause we took that one down, and then we did the other one

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
At the bridge. Yes. Which, like

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
The same thing happened. We're like, where are they?

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
And I looked over and I'm like, that dude's on his phone over there

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Yeah. That's the other guy

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
So I, it's, so, it's funny

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
We're talking about the Mewtwo

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
I have done, probably about

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Eight Mewtwo raids

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Uh, between here and back in Toronto

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
And, not for the life of me could I catch

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
More than one god damn Mewtwo

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
So I did catch one here, and

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
So now I have two, but that's it

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Yeah. And it's hard now to get

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
To find Mewtwo raids back

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
In Toronto because it seems like

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Once the initial rush of

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Mewtwo coming out was done

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Nobody's doing raids anymore

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
I find that people still want to do them

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
I mean, it might be harder, especially in like

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Less trafficked areas to find the people

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
But people still generally want to do them

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Because they're really good experience

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
And it's the only way you can get rare candy and items

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
So you might as well use your free pass

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
For the day if you can get a group

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
You might as well do it, there's no harm in doing it

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
I did, I did join, uh

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
There's a discord group, uh, for the Toronto

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Area for Pokemon Go

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
So, I'm gonna utilize that a bit more

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Now that we're starting to get into the colder

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Months in Toronto

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
It's a lot harder to get people to do raids

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Unless you actually coordinate

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Well plus, load up on Trashymon here

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
In California, and then when you go back

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
You could just be like, does anyone want to do distance trading

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Cause it's, it's like 3000 kilometers

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Cause like, when I open my Alolan

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Eggs, I'm very particular

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
I will tend to, so like

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
This is why if you're on my friends list

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
And you're somewhere on the east coast, like I've been opening

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Your presence a lot more lately

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Like, if you're like Atlanta

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Toronto, or I've got a little group

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
There's like some New York, some New Jersey, I'm like kinda

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Figuring out who's where, I'm opening those gifts

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
When I have the holes in my inventory for Alolan eggs

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Because if nothing else, if I get another fucking

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Sandshrew or Grimer or something

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
I can trade it for a hella distance

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
And I think they're doing the same thing with my eggs

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Because then the eggs in the west coast

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
You can at least trade for distance

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
And get that medal, which you know

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
The medal doesn't really mean anything, it's just EP

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
No, but for the people that are in those

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Type of Discord groups, they want

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
They're full completionists, you know

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
They're checking their IVs, they're doing badges and medals

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
And things like that, so, it helps

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Yeah, so, cool

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Um, and then I think it's also fun to have

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Pokemon from like, other places

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Like, so now you have a Mewtwo from Sacramento

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
That will like, kinda remind you of that day

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Oh yes, absolutely

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Just like, my one and only Regirock

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Is from Atlanta

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
So during Dragon Con, that was the only time I was actually able to

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Capture Regirock, but then I also go

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
That was the time I got Bobby Blackwolf to actually

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Do a Pokemon raid, so that's like

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
You know, like, woo, we got a little memory there

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
And then we traded Unknown today

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
And it became Lucky

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Yeah, Lucky you

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Yeah, he got the Lucky D

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Because I gave him one of the Unknown, I got a Dragon Con

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Because I saved like, you know, I basically

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Don't have an Unknown yet here, here you go

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
You don't have one yet

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Oh, really?

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Remind me next episode, I'll get you one

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
So, then what left, you got the Lucky Unknown

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
But because you were like, what do you want

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
I'm like, my Contodex is done

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
There's like, literally nothing, just give me trash

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
So you gave me a Pidgey

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
I got a Lucky Pidgey

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
It's because you haven't gotten enough Lucky

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Stuff yet

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
The first few trades you do

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Like, first 10 trades are gonna be Lucky

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
So whatever I get from you is gonna be Lucky

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
So, yeah

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Anyway, so that was, that was a little irritating

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
But anyway

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Well, max out that Pidgey then

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Yeah, you know what, actually because

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
When they're Lucky, they get good stats

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
And this guy is a 15 Attack

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
15 Defense

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
So I'm like, well, if nothing else, he might just

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Be a funny Gym Defender

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
If nothing else, like,

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Why not?

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
He'll be half price to level him up to

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Level him up a little bit and throw him in a gym somewhere

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Anyway, my game of the week, so I've been playing

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Not just World of Warcraft

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
I'm not on the raiding thing

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
And I don't think I will be

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
But I just enjoy, like, the

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
World quests, just the leveling up

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Experience, I started a new

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Monk, just because I wanted to

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Level up again, it seems like they fixed

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
A lot of the level sinking dungeons thing

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Because when that patch first went in, I was pissed

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
I was not having a good time

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
But now it seems it's fine now

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
I did, okay, so the day that

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Patch went in that rescaled

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
The old world where all the dungeons were 1-60

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
I went in and I got

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Dire Maul or something, and it was

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
It was a shit show, because

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
People were not used to it the new way

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
And it was impossible to heal

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
So you could get

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Dungeons that were

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
For level 60 at level 20?

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
No, they would still unlock later

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
My panda shaman

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Was level 50, but we got that

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
But other people that were higher

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Would get sinked down, like for example

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
I'm level 27, and I just queued for

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Dungeon, I got Wailing Caverns at

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
27, but I was scaled down

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
To what a player in Wailing Caverns would be

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Which is kind of like the 14 system

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
A little bit, it's this weird

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Weird iteration of it, whereas like

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
14 just straight up level sinks you

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
It's a little different in a while

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
But anyway, I've been playing a lot of

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Forza Horizon 4, I did a stream of that earlier

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
This week, and that game is fun

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Forza is so extra

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
That's the greatest thing about it, and I love that

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
My character is named Potato

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
And they actually say, okay Potato

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Do you want to go get some new influence?

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Okay Potato, it's great to meet you Potato

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Potato, we're gonna need you in a movie

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
So I just love that they call me Potato

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Why do they call you Potato?

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Because I ask them to

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Because the game has

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
All these names loaded into it

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
They always call me Matt

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Okay, here's the funny thing

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
I think it reads your Xbox profile

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Because when I started the full game

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
They were like, do you want us to call you Rob?

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
And I was like

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Let me see what the other names are

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
And the first page is all like

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Quote unquote normal names

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
And they have a pretty impressive list

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Of like 300 names

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Sadly, not everybody's name is gonna be in there

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Yeah, Delvin's not gonna be in there

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
If you have a unique name, it's not gonna be in there

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Sorry, but if your name isn't in there

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Then you go to page 2, which is

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Nicknames

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
And there's all these different nicknames that they'll call you

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
So you can pick one

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
I don't know if they'll call you Mega Ma'am

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
I bet Mega is one of the names that they'll call you

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
And one of the names that was in there was Potato

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
So I was doing the stream

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
I was like

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Perfect, that's a perfect name for me, Potato

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Can I change that?

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
You can change it

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
You go into the menu and it's

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Right where you pick your car

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Wherever you customize your character

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
It's in the menu, it's not hard to miss

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
And you change it at any time

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
So if I feel like I don't want them to call me Potato anymore

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
But it's all voice acted

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Like when I say they call me Potato

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
The voice acting says it

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
It's not just the text in the game

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Naming your character in an RPG

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Like butts, so that you make all the characters say

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Get over here, butts

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
And all that stuff, right?

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Anyway

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
But Fours is fun

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
I'm not quite in the open world yet

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
I don't really give my full thoughts because

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
I'm still making my way through the season

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
I didn't realize I'm not in the open world

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
I thought I was

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
There's like a pre-open world

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
So like you're still seeing everything

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Like the other people and stuff

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
But I noticed today there were way less

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
People in there than there were when

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
The day the game came out

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Because more people have gotten through it

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
So they're in the real open world now

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
I guess I should play through the game then

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
The seasons are on a fixed schedule

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
The schedule will change when you start

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
So it basically forces you to go

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
So the very first thing in the game

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
You play all the seasons in rapid succession

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
That's just to get you a taste, right?

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
But then when you start the game it's like, okay

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
It's autumn, go do this race, this race, and this race

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
And then it's gonna be winter

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
And then get this many fans

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
And it will be, you know, I'm assuming spring

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
And then summer

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Once you get through all four seasons

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Then you'll go into the real game mode

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Where the seasons rotate like once a week

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Like a real game week

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
So I think they had winter last week

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
So I would imagine it's spring in game right now

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Or it's gonna turn to spring on Friday

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
And then that's when you're like racing

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
With other people and doing those events

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Everybody's kind of on the same clock, so to speak

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
So, there's that

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Yeah, gosh, I don't know what else to say

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
About Forza

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
If you think you might enjoy a new

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Type of racing game, I urge you to check out the demo

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
I think Forza is one of the must-own

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Titles on Xbox One

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
It honestly, in my opinion, is Microsoft's

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Best exclusive right now

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
And yes, I'm including Halo

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Fight me

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
So, Forza Horizon

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Is Microsoft's best exclusive right now

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
And maybe I'll change my mind on that later

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
But these are must-have games if you own

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
An Xbox One

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
And even if you don't own an Xbox One, the great thing is

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
They're on PC

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
That's where I got mine, I don't need an Xbox One

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
That's the reason I got rid of my Xbox One

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
All the Xbox One games I wanted to play

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Were all on PC, so I was like

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Okay, well, time to get a PS4, and I traded it in

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Yeah, so, I mean

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Yeah, and I bought it

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Digitally, so you get the whole like

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
I have it on PC, and if I want to

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Play it on my Xbox One, I can't, which I did today

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
So you could watch a little bit, and see the game

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
You know, because my office is a little cramped

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
It's harder to watch me play on PC, so we

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
You know, did that a little bit, so

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
It's nice to- And your TV's bigger

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Yeah, TV is a lot bigger, yeah, it's nicer, so

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Anyway, um

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Bonds006 says I want all Forza games on PC

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Well, they probably will be in the future

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Forza Horizon 3 was on PC, too

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
I don't know about Motorsport, because I don't follow

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
That series as closely, because I-

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Seven is, I think

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
I prefer the arcade racers to the

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Simulation racers, that's why you don't hear me talk

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Like this about Gran Turismo

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
But I fucking love Mario Kart

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
And F-Zero, because those are arcade racers

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
There's a big difference

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Burnout, I love that game, that's an arcade racer

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
I stand blur

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Really hard, and I'm really sad that that franchise

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Is gone, because that was more of an arcade racer, too

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Um, so, that's

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
That's my thought

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Let's see, what else, so we went to round one

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
I should quickly say, you got to have

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Your first experience at round one

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Yeah, I forgot to mention that in my, I guess as part

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Of my gaming week

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Oh, real quick, I just want to go back to Pokemon Go

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Now, did you make sure to get one

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Of those Pikachus with a hat, because they're

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Very hard to find

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
No, they went away today

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
I'm glad you asked, Loki

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
I lucked out, I tapped the one on my house

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Yesterday morning, not only was it a Pikachu

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
And a hat, it was a shiny Pikachu and a hat

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
So knowing that those, I mean, as annoying

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Those little guys were, because they were everywhere

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
For like two days

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Like, that makes that shiny

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Really rare

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
So like, my Pokemon E-peen

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Is really big right now, because not only

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Did I get the shiny hat Pikachu, but I got

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
A shiny Drowzee today

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
My shiny E-peen is like

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Real shiny right now

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Real shiny

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
I bathed for you, anyway

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Where were we? Oh yes, round one

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Round one, speaking of shiny

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
In new places

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
So yeah, round one was amazing

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
It's huge, there's tons

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Of arcade games in there

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
We don't really have

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Very many arcades anymore

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
In the Toronto area

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
There was a place that opened up recently

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Right near the CN Tower

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
And Skydome area

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
That has arcade in it

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
But it is a fraction

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Of what is in round one

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
In terms of both ticket spinners

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
And arcade games

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Like, round one

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Just had a huge, a mass amount

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Of games, so I was there

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
With you playing

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
I got to play some old fighting games

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
That I really enjoyed, they had Tatsunoko

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Versus Capcom

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Which I had never played, I had only played it on Wii

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
So it was fun to play that

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
I was playing some King of Fighters, I was playing some Street Fighter

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
And they had

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Mario and Sonic

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
At the Rio Olympics

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Which I didn't even know was an arcade game

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
And also Luigi's Mansion

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
I had no idea that

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Yeah, they had one of those at Dave and Buster's

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
That was broken, aww

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Yeah, I had no idea that these things

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Were ever made as arcade games

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
And I'm kind of wondering why they're not more

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Available

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
And rampant, but I guess it's just

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Arcades probably aren't

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
As big money makers, why they have those

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Stupid ticket spinners

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Yeah, I got to play

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
The new BB&E 2DX

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
The Cannonball Rush, I think it's called

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Which is a racing theme, I didn't realize that

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
But that's what they call it

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
And I actually played some of the new songs

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Like, usually I'm really bad

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Just ask JD, who goes to round one with me a lot

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Like, when I go play 2DX, I'm really bad about

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
What's in 4 style that I can go back and play

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
So I, like, never play the new songs

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
But this time I really did play some of the new songs

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
There was some good stuff in there, it's just hard to hear in there

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Yes, I was just gonna say

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
I was trying to do a rhythm game

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
I can't remember which one I was playing

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
To be honest

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
But it was very hard to play because I

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Couldn't keep, I did not

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Hear the music at all, period

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
I should have thought to tell you to bring headphones

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
And I didn't remember this myself, because a lot of people

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
You can put headphones in a lot of these jeans

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Which is a great idea, because

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Without it, you can't fucking hear shit in there

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
So, um, yeah

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
And I got to see Dance Rush, I didn't play it

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Because the dance area was a little crowded

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
And I was, like, I'm gonna just keep it real

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
We had just had Lucille's BBQ

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
And so I was feeling very puffy

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
And I was not

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
I was not gonna get on

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
That was not the moment

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
And JD's like, come on, play, dance, dance

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
I'm like, you don't understand

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
If I get on that machine, it's gonna turn into

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Dance, dance, fart

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
And none of y'all want that right now

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Nobody deserves that kind of treatment

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
You don't deserve that type of treatment

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
The strangers don't deserve that type of treatment

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
It's not gonna happen

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
I am perfectly fine just watching

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Although, there were people there who were doing

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Their gym workouts there

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Right?

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
There was a little bit of funk going on

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
They had their shorts and their little gym towels

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Bottled water, like, they were full on

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
But then I think back

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
That's just how I played DDR though

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
I need those things in order to

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Not be in your garage

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
I totally get it

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Because if I don't have the towel

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
It's gonna be dripping all over the place

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
And then no one wants to slip in that

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
So, anyway

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
So I watched, and JD played

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
DDR, and he did go into

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
The retro mode, and he played

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
D2R, so I could see

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
The full background and how it emulates

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
DDR Extreme and all that, and it was silly

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
But in a good way

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
I appreciated the throwback

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
That was pretty cool that I got to see that

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Anyway, very long

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Winded answer to gaming week, but it was pretty busy

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Because when you're here, I'm gonna take you to all the

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Fun spots to play games. We never did make it

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
To coin-op, I was gonna take you there, but then I read

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
They didn't have a Killer Instinct machine

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Which I wanted

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Delvin needs to play Killer Instinct in the arcade

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
And I can't remember where around here has one

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Maybe at that

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Old arcade that's in Sutter

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Street might have one

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Oh, I always forget that place is there

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Dang

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Well, you know we might luck out

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Because we're gonna go to Reno tomorrow

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Which, that's a whole other story about why we're gonna go to Reno

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
But we are

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
And they have arcades there that time forgot

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
You might luck out and find it

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Yeah, we'll go check them out

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Oh, Pepper Mill

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Has like that retro arcade

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
So, remind me

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Go to Pepper Mill

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Sounds like a plan

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Alright, let's move on to some actual gaming news

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
And not casino talk

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
So, let's get into some gaming news with Loki

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Starting us off tonight

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
So, since we're not gonna be talking about movies anymore

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Yes, I know that you guys are disappointed

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Let's talk about something else

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
That's coming soon

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Rumored to be coming soon

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
A new model of the Nintendo Switch

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
According to the Wall Street Journal

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Nintendo is gonna be introducing

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
A new version of the Switch

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Next year

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
No word on what it is

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Other than it will probably share some features

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
With the current version

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
And be compatible with existing Switch software

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Well, you don't say

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
That's just a safe guess

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Wall Street Journal

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Nintendo is apparently

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
They're debating on what new hardware

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
And software features

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
To include in the upgrade

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Here's an idea

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
If you don't know what to put in the upgrade

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Don't fucking upgrade your system

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Unless you have a plan

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
You don't need to upgrade it

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
If you have nothing to upgrade it with

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
And what do we really need to upgrade it with

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I mean, the only thing I could see

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
That they could do

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
To add to the system

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Really, is more storage

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Cause 32GB onboard storage

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Is fucking stupid nowadays

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I'm imagining

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
This is gonna sound ridiculous Loki

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
But I think if they do

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Like a 2019

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
My hope is that they would not segregate

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Like they did with new 3DS and 3DS

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Where you're gonna have shit like Xenoblade Chronicles

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
That only plays on new Switch

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
I would really hate to see that happen

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
This early in the game

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Not that it's an impossibility

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Because there is a potential that Nintendo might just go in there

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
And zhuzh it up a little bit

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Zhuzh it up, meaning

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Just a little more memory

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
A fancier screen

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
We're just gonna come in here and do a little makeover

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Get the guys from Queer Eye to come

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Get a little makeover

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Just make sure Jonathan Van Ness

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
We're gonna patch out that taker chip

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
So you can't run that homebrew

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Cause that's really what's got our knickers in a bunch

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Make sure Jonathan Van Ness comes out and says gorgeous

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
This is a gorgeous screen, it's very gorgeous

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
We're gonna have a very gorgeous looking system here

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
So one of my theories

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
That we've talked about before

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Is that

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Pokemon is the big game that's obviously coming next year

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Yes

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
And that still is a game that is geared towards kids

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
So

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
My theory

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
And thoughts is that

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Whatever remake or redesign

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Or upgrade that they're coming out with

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Could potentially be

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
A portable only version

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Of the Switch

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
That'll be a bit smaller for kids to use

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
And it'll be a bit cheaper

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
So that you're not giving your kid a

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
$300 handheld system that they'll

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Throw around inevitably and throw on the ground

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
And whatever

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
So that might be the angle they're going

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
And then that will just be for people who only

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Want to play the Switch on the go

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
They'll have like a better screen

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Like a smartphone type screen

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
So for better battery life

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Because we know that the Switch as it is now

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Has poor battery life on the go

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
So I think that might

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
And it won't segregate the market that way

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
That's

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
An answer I'm comfortable with

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
That's a good answer

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
The Neon Family Feud, good answer

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Here comes Loki

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Here's why it's not gonna happen

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
The reason why it's only a 720p

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Screen in the first place

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Is because it can't run anything

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Higher than that in portable mode

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
That's why it has to be plugged in because they're

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Underclocking the CPU in that

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
GPU to be able to run what's on there

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
So

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
For them to put like a 1080p

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Screen in there, it's just not gonna happen

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Because they can't

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Do it, so if anything

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
I don't

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Really know, it's just an excuse

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Really just to upgrade that chip so that

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
They can't have homebrew in there is really all

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
It is. I just hope if they do this

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
They take the 3DS out back

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
And shoot it

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
That also is kind of

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
My opinion segregating the portable market

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Is that they still have these games like WarioWare

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
That are coming out on the 3DS

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
That we're not getting on the Switch now

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Yes, I understand the WarioWare has like the

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Blowing mechanics and some things that don't really

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
That don't really exist on the Switch

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Right, like the microphone and everything

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
So I get it. There's a microphone on the Switch

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Is there?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
I think so. I don't think so

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
I think that's why everything had to go through a smartphone

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Or you plug in a headphone or that whole thing

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Because I don't think there's one built into it

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
There's no camera either like there is on the 3DS

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
So there's some things

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
So I understand why it can't be one for one

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
But like that Luigi's Mansion remake

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
That should be on the Switch

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
That should have been a Switch game

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
So I do hope if they're going to

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Ask us to get this newer Switch

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
They really need to take the 3DS out back

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
And shoot it

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
They really need to have some pretty

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Kick ass features that they're adding

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
To it to get people to want it

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Because just look at all the

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Refreshes that they've done with the 3DS

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
You know

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Made it bigger

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Added a little nub that no one wanted

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
I see where Delvin's going

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Make a newer Switch that doesn't have

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Detachable controllers

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Doesn't have HDMI out or any of that type of stuff

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
They can remove components which will make the system

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Overall cheaper

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Not having detachable controllers is going to be a big mistake

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Because here's one problem

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
First off you got games like Super Mario Party

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Oh hey you want to play that game?

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Well you got to detach the fucking controllers to play that game

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Because we don't work in handheld mode

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Well but that's because of the whole laying the screens next to each other

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Thing which is kind of magic

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
I will say yeah

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
It's stupid

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
It's dumb though that you need to have it just to do the motion controls and stuff

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
But I feel like that whole laying the screens

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Next to each other sort of thing

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
There's more to that

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
We're going to see in a later game

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I think that might just be one mode of the game

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
No no but I mean that

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Technology, that concept

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
We're going to see it again

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
And what better way to perhaps do that

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
If more people have more of the portable

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
To go version of Switch

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Potentially

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Alright well I mean we'll see where we go with it

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
I mean technically it is a rumor

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
They may not do anything but

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I wouldn't

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I wouldn't put it past Nintendo to do it

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Because honestly

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
I don't know

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Why redesign it now?

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Unless you fix your stupid

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Online support

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
With the whole app

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Why do a PS4 mini

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Two years after PS4 launches

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I don't get that either

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Or PS4 Pro

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
It makes sense because it has

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
You can push better graphics with it

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
It has stronger processing power

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
But it's

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Not segregating the marketplace

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Because it still runs

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
All the same games and everything

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
I don't see what

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
We may also be overthinking it to be fair

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Because then my mind also goes

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
They did do a new Xbox One

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Like just a year and it was a gig

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Instead of

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
They did a different color or something too

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
It's not that big a deal

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
So maybe this whole thing

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Is not going to be that big a deal

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Like you said in the very beginning

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
More on board storage memory to start

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
And then maybe some different colors

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I think it makes sense because

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Having these installs with different games

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
People are buying stuff

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
More digitally

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
The indie game marketplace is seriously driving

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I think a lot of sales for the system

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Because there's not a ton of games coming out

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Especially mainline

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Switch games

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Yes and no

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Because I think at this point the Switch has the backlog

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Where when somebody comes to me and says

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
If I buy a Switch what game should I buy

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
I'm sitting there going

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Did you have a Wii U

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
And at the end of the time the answer is no

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
So I'm like alright

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
You need to get Breath of the Wild

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
You need to get Mario Odyssey

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
You need to get Mario Party 8

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Do you like Skyrim?

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
You might need to get Skyrim

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
There's a growing library of Switch games

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Bayonetta

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I always recommend Bayonetta 1 and 2

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
There's a growing library of games now

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I feel like the Switch doesn't need to justify

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
We don't have enough games to play on the Switch

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
You're thinking

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
TL Shade

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
That was Microsoft's problem

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
They didn't have enough exclusives

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
You can play Rise Son of Rome

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
But everything else

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Microsoft was offering

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
At that time was on

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
PlayStation 4

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Which is why

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
I'm bringing this up again because you and I were just talking about this last night

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
We were having a little nerd out

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Nervous Lumber Party

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
I said how quickly we forget

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Never forget

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
The biggest news

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Out of E3 2018

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Is that Microsoft acquired

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
A bunch of fucking studios

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
They are laying this

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
They are laying out this path

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
To get them back

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
In the front of the pack

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
And that is going to be

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
When they unleash whatever their next system is

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
They're going to have all these games

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Only playable on Xbox

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
It's just the question is going to be

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Are you going to put out Forza Horizon

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Crackdown type games

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
As exclusives

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Or are you going to put out Rise Son of Rome

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Because one of them

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Will make Microsoft in the lead

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
At least in the US

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
One of them? Pack it up

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
You all know what I mean

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Alright

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
But anyway

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
In Nintendo's case

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
We've always known this is Nintendo's

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Thing that is going to always put them

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
In a league of their own

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Nintendo is the

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
The underscore bolded

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
The best

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Game maker

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Making video games

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
True story

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I don't know if that's the case anymore

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Honestly

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
I don't

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
There's a long pause because I'm looking

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I gave him that look

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
I get it

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Super Mario Odyssey was a great game

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
But I mean

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Other companies make great games too

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Sure

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
I'm just saying Nintendo's the best

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
I think we're giving them too much

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
We're giving them too much

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Well it's fine that you're doing this bullshit

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Because you made Super Mario Odyssey

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
It's fine that you're doing this bullshit

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Because you made Breath of the Wild

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
I don't know

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Bobby Blackwolf is trying to summarize

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
What you're saying

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
In quotes here

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
I get it Nintendo makes great games

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
It sucks

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Yeah they suck at everything else

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
And you know what

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
I understand that you think it doesn't matter

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
They make great games

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
But if you're running it on hardware that doesn't make any fucking sense

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Or they have shit that gets in the way

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Then that's going to be the problem

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
I get it when people are like

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Why won't Nintendo just put their games out on the

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
PlayStation 4 that would fix everything

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
I get it

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Exactly

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Wow that would be fucking awesome

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
That would be like gaming would never be better

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Than if like

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
If Nintendo made games

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
For the Sony PlayStation 4

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
And Microsoft did all of the online component

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Like that would be the perfect thing

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Oh that would be perfect

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Not going to ever fucking happen

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
But I might masturbate to that later

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Great theory

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Great idea

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Never going to happen

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Well let's see

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
I have to wait and see what the system is going to be

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
I might like

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
With everything with Nintendo my expectations are low

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Alright let's move on

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Let's talk about Fortnite

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
You want to talk about what's fucking huge in gaming right now

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
It doesn't matter what system you own

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Because now we got the cross play problem solved

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
So this game is literally

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Everywhere

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Fortnite

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
It's on the phones, it's on the Switch, on the PS4

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
It's on the PC, it's on Macs

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
It's everywhere

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Everybody's playing it during the Emmys

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Yes as we learned on RuPaul's podcast

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
This last week

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Carson Daly was playing Fortnite during the Emmys

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Apparently

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
So anyway, Fortnite is still going

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
And now there's going to be more encouragement

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
To try to kind of keep that Fortnite

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Train going

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Because you know one place where

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
PUBG is probably

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
PUBG lost a lot of steam

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
They were the number one, number two game on Twitch

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
For a long time

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
And it seemed like PUBG news

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Was getting really light

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
And they started to kind of fall behind a little bit

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
And I'm not totally shading PUBG

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
But that's just

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Facts are facts

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Go look at the Twitch standings

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
PUBG is not number one anymore

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Facts are facts America

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Epic wants to keep Fortnite out in the lead

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
So here's an idea

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Why not pay content creators

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
And this is

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
This is like

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Interesting because I can't think of a lot of

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Game makers

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Because you know some game makers

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Want to stop content creators

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Maybe that's not

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Completely fair but you know what I mean

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Sometimes they hold them back a little bit

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
But Epic is launching a

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Support a creator event

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
That will send real money

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
To folks on Twitch and YouTube

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
When gamers make purchases with

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
V-Bucks

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
So starting October 8th until the end of

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
18 if you put in the name

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Of a creator in Fortnite's

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Shop to reward them

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
When you buy a costume or glider

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
So you know

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Guess what you're gonna start hearing on every

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Podcast who knows maybe this one I don't know

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
It's gonna be use offer code

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
O-L-R at checkout

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
That's offer code O-L-R

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Yeah that's right it's offer code

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
O-L-R

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
At checkout

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Watch watch these content

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Creators of Fortnite wait for it

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
And let's find our best content creators

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Plugging their offer codes

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
That they're gonna put in at checkout

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
This is standard business nowadays because you know

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
You're not getting paid by YouTube

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Or Twitch that much

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
I mean so you gotta make your money

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Somewhere but this is interesting because

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
The only like

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Qualifications for this you have to

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Produce Fortnite related material in the

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Past 30 days have at

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Least 1,000 social

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Media followers which sounds high

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
But social media like I have

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
That on Twitter like not to be that

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Guy but like you know if you have

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Been on social media and working

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
All that long enough and frequent enough you're

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Probably gaining a lot of followers

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
So um and I

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Didn't see if that is a thousand YouTube

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
A thousand Twitch I don't know but you have to

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Have a thousand followers and you have to

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Avoid illegal or toxic

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Behavior so you can't be a jerk

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Fair enough

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
It's not gonna be it's not gonna pay your mortgage

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
50,000 V-Bucks

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
That's about $500

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
The creator will get $25

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
So that's like 5%

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Which I mean

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
It's not a bad

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
It's right it's better than nothing

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Somebody like Ninja

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Oh he's gonna be raking it in

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Oh it is he's gonna be he's gonna fill a bathtub

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Full of money it's gonna be like that scene with Demi

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Morin in Decent Proposal where she's laughing on the

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Bedroll that's gonna be Ninja

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Okay it already is Ninja

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Anyway

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
So yeah it's gonna incentivize

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Content creators to move

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
And Loki yes in some ways

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Like you know there's

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Other ways that content creators can make money

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Through like biddies on Twitch and subscriptions

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
And all that but you know what

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Knowing that wow if I keep playing

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Fortnite I can make a little more

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Money is gonna keep people

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Playing Fortnite it's smart

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
It even makes me wanna go

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
I have a thousand social media followers

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Maybe I need to play Fortnite some night

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
I'm not gonna but I hope some other companies

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
It would be pretty cool if they follow up on this

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
It would be pretty rad

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
And then it's kind of a

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Another way to keep

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Fortnite popular cause

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
If Fortnite just stays on Twitch

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Or YouTube as the number one most

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Watched game

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
It just keeps it in people's face

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
It does it does

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Here's the new mode here's the new stuff here's all the new

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Crap you can buy on the online marketplace

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
For sure for sure anyway well let's move

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
On Loki

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Alright

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
So apparently

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
For the longest time we've been asking

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
For the ability to be able to change our

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
PlayStation Network

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
User names

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
And Sony's always said

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Oh yeah don't worry we'll have something worked out

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Soon you know we're working on it we're looking into

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
It blah blah blah

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Well that might actually be getting closer because

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Apparently

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
There's been some game studios

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
That have been speaking anonymously

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
To different social

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Media outlets and letting them

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Know that hey

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
That they've been

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Participating in bug fixing

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
And tweaking settings and stuff like that

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
To make sure that it's gonna be compatible

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Their games are compatible with these

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
PlayStation Network name profile

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Changes or user names

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
So they have like the option

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
To edit user name

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
They have like a guide

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
That they've been going off of to kind of

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Work on it so it is something that is coming up

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Um

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
We don't know when yet

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I remember that they were originally talking that

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
They're gonna make the announcement at PSX

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
But that's not gonna happen this year so maybe

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Around that time maybe the end

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Of this year I don't know there's nothing to stop them

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
From just doing an internet press release I mean

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
That's the way you can do things now

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
So they've got that PlayStation blog

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
They've got a Twitter account

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
They dump a bombshell like that

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
And it's gonna run around the internet real quick

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
So that's something people have been asking

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
For it does seem ridiculous

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
That now it's like 2018 and we're still

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Oh my god Sony might allow you the

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Ability to change your name real soon y'all

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
I wonder what the reason behind that is

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
It's gotta do something with the infrastructure

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
There's gotta be something rooted in

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Yeah I think it was their infrastructure where they had the

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
User names like the accounts were tied

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
To the user name it wasn't tied to like some

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Number that the user name was like

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
You know tied to the account

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Yeah so now they have to

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Go back and rework all that shit so that

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
It's now tied to this universal number

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
That your user name is then tied to that

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Account so you can change it

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Or whatever it just it just seems weird

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
That it would have taken this long to get here

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Because I mean and then again

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
I don't know as much about networking

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
And infrastructure so I will be the first to admit

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Maybe I'm just ignorant to how

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Hard this really is

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
But why wouldn't they have just

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
At some point

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Taken Playstation Network down for a day

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
To say we're gonna run this thing

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
That's gonna change all your

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
User names behind the scenes into a number

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
And then that number is now you

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
But you won't see it because now you have your name

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
And then now if you wanna change your name it's fine

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Cause we put in those numbers behind the scene

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
That's why we took Playstation Network down for a day

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Like

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Am I crazy?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Whenever there's a database

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
And someone's

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Information is in there

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
That information is tied to an

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
ID and that could be a number

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
It could be a name it's just something that's

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
A unique identifier and they probably

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Chose the user name to be that unique identifier

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Which was a poor choice

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Now that I know in Microsoft Access you always

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Have your key field

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
So they

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Basically chose the user name to be the unique

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Identifier instead of it being

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Some other number behind the

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Scene usually a key that's like numbers

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
And letters and now

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
So if you change it it almost

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Fucks up the account and then maybe

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
This would've prevented the hack because we would've

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Never well no because I was like maybe

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
They would've only seen that random numbers of letters

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
And numbers and not you know the user names but

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Actually no they would've still pulled

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
The other yeah yeah anyway

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Alright anyway let's move on I wanna talk about

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
This because I think I don't know if this is gonna be

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
So much a game but it's like VR

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
It's gonna be Oculus

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
And HTC Vive

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
And I don't know about you guys but I'm

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Super into it and this is

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
A new VR experience

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
I don't know if it's like a game

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
But knowing what it is

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
It's probably gonna be like

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Like what is it anyway

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
It's Twin Peaks is what it is so Twin Peaks

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Y'all know it was a show

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Back in the 90's on ABC but then they

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Brought it back recently on Showtime

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
And I was a fan of the old

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Series and I loved the new one too

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Even though there was a lot of like

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Especially like

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Here's the thing with Twin Peaks

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
The next to last episode like if they had

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Ended it with that it would've been like

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
They kinda answered a lot of the questions

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
They kept some things open I love the way that

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Next to last episode ended but then

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
In true David Lynch form there's a

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Full another episode after that that keeps

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Going that the entire thing

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Is just what the

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Fuck and that's

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
How it ends but that's

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
But you go to see a David

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Lynch anything you need to be prepared

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
To be walking out of that theater going

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
What the actual

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Fuck was that

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
And that was what happened when I saw Lost Highway

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Years ago in the theater as I left out

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
What the fuck

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Keske fuck

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Anyway

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
So maybe that's gonna be the same thing

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
When you do Twin Peaks VR is that you're gonna be

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Putting that going into that and then like what the fuck

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
I have never watched Twin Peaks ever

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Really you should

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Here's the thing in my

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Personal opinion the first

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Season that was on ABC that's

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Only like 7 episodes or something like that

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Is like a must watch

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
It is really fucking good and like

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
You see things

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
There that they weren't doing in TV

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
In the 90's that people are doing

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Now the second

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Season of the show like

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
If you like the first season and you

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Want to get more of the story you should watch the

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Second season only because it

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Kind of continues it but it does get

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Weaker throughout the second season

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Because David Lynch didn't do all of it

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
The network put a lot

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Of pressure to reveal Laura Palmer's

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Killer before they really wanted to do it

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
And it kind of went downhill after they revealed a killer

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
But there are elements

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
In that that then come back

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
In Twin Peaks

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
The Return so if you're not gonna

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Watch the second season at least read

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
The cliff notes read the spoilers read through it

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
And then watch The Return because

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
In my opinion The Return like

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Is like there

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
It's crazy because like I said the 90's

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Version of Twin Peaks there was nothing like it

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
On TV then The Return

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
There's nothing like it on TV

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Now like there was a

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Particular episode of that show

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
And any of you that watch it will know that I was talking

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
About that was like

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
40 minutes of just

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Pure

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
What the

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Fuck am I watching

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
But like you sit there at the end of it

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
And going I think

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
I understood a third

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Of that

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
But it was really fucking brilliant

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
That that was art

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
I don't know what it was

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
But it was art

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
And any of you that have watched the revival series

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Know exactly which episode I'm talking about

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Anyway

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
I'm sorry I'm finally looking at chat over

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
At live.vognetwork.com

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
As Joe and Hunter Matt said I stopped trying to make sense

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Of David Lynch after the 90's if you try to

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
You're just gonna hurt your brain yep pretty much

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Anyway

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
So Twin Peaks VR

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Where this whole thing was supposed to be started

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
So Twin Peaks VR is gonna put you in the Red

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Room which is a very important place

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
In Twin Peaks mythology

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
This could be considered a minor

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Spoiler but the Red Room

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Is basically like you could think of it as like

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
A gateway to hell that's kind of like what I

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Sort of look at it as is that the Red Room is like

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
A gateway to hell

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
So anyway

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Twin Peaks also gets into this whole mythology

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
About that there could be doppelgangers

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
In the world that you may have

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Somebody that looks exactly like you but they are

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
From this bad place type of thing

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Do they have a goatee?

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Um

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Not necessarily

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
But I'll leave it at that

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Anyway so

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Twin Peaks VR is gonna take you in this Red Room

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
And you'll be in there

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
And you're gonna they say in the game

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
You wind up in the Red Room and

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Fans of the series will follow in the footsteps of

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Dale Cooper to try to make their way back

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Into the life that they left behind

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
So there will be places and dialogues

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
From the original series and the sequel

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
It's gonna be made for the HTC Vive

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
And the Rift it's only gonna be available

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
On Steam we don't know when it's gonna come

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Out but they are showing it next

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Weekend at the Festival of

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Disruption in Los Angeles

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Which I believe is a David Lynch or at least

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
David Lynch has a large part of this

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Festival thing going on cause you know

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Katya is actually gonna be performing at it too

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Random?

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Well because no Katya fucking loves Twin Peaks

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Like her thing

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
At DragCon New York City where you took a

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Picture of her she fucking her set

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Was the Red Room from Twin Peaks

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
And she's actually made outfits

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Inspired by Twin Peaks like she's

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
She's a stan She's very into it

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
And that's why I love her cause she loves

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
That weird shit so anyway

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Sadly

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
No word if it's gonna be on PlayStation

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
VR

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Cause you know that would be a nice thing

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
So anyway

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Do you get pie though?

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
No word if there will be a damn fine cup of coffee

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Involved no word on that yet

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Or if there will be random dancing to songs

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Playing on the jukebox who knows

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Anyway I think we should move on to other

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Other weird television shows

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
And things that have spawned from them right Loki?

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Yes like The Walking Dead

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Unfortunately like The Walking Dead

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
We might also kind of compare The Walking Dead

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
To Telltale

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Which is kind of Walking Dead

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Of it's own

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Being that they've laid off 90%

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Of their staff

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
But that's not all because they're continuing

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
To lay off people as well

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
So

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
They had a skeleton crew

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
That was you know left behind to kind of

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Finish up some of the stuff on The Walking Dead

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
And also

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
The interactive Minecraft

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Series that's supposed to be on

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Netflix well

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Now of course with that

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
They're going to be letting

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Some of those people go as well

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Because now they have another

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Team that's gonna be working on

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
The

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Walking Dead series

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
So they said everyone involved is trying to make sure

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Clementines story is told

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
I'm not concerned at the moment with

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Telling that story

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
In the comics

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
They said that

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
As odd as it may sound 25 of us will continue

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Foreseeable

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
I'll make further comment

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
In the coming weeks after today's events

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
It's not clear of

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
How many of those 25 will

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Remain because they're not trying

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
To necessarily

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Keep them around I guess since they have

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Another studio going to be working on it

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
And so yeah with that there is gonna be

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
The series will be finished by

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Another company so they've got

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Skybound Games is gonna be

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Completing season 4

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Of The Walking Dead

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
And of course they made an announcement on

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Twitter saying we're so happy to

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Announce that we've reached a deal with Telltale Games

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
That will allow Skybound

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
To continue The Walking Dead final

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Season more details

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
To come I want to say that they were

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Trying to

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
They're working with the original Telltale team

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
To finish the story

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
The way that the fans deserve

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Um

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Still disappointing to see that they're

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
You know letting go all those people

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Without severance and now they have another team

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Working on the game that doesn't make any sense but

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
That's what they're doing

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
I don't know

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
I don't really

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Follow the walking dead

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Games I know that they're pretty good but

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
It kinda sucks cause you know

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
The quality is gonna be quite

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
I don't know if it's gonna be up there with the other

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Games

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Yeah this is really unexplored territory too

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
With the studio closing and a lot of people

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Have very strong feelings about how Telltale

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Has treated those employees

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
But yet at the same time

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Telltale has created these obligations

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
To customers out there that they are

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Also not gonna be able to follow up on

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
You know now they've got this whole exchange

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
But there's this whole like

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Duality now where it's like okay

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Well who is more important in this scenario

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
The obligation to the customer

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Or the obligation to the employees

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Because this is gonna be

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Great in I guess fulfilling

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
That obligation to the customer even though

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
The quality may be who knows what

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
I suppose it depends on how many of those Telltale

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Employees they get but it's not

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Gonna really address the concern of how

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
To Telltale treat the employees

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Sure some of them may be able to come

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
On but we know it's not gonna be all of them

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Some of those folks have probably already

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Moved on to new jobs

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
I don't know if like honestly if it were

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Me you know unless you're really really

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Passionate about like your job and stuff

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Like I can't imagine like oh I

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Got fired without severance yeah

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
And now you want me to work on that game again

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
That's very true and those

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Employees have every right like even if they extend

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
This offer and say would you like to come finish the game

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
These employees have every right to say go take a hike

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Like just I'm not interested

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Because I have bad memories

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
With that are they being asked to come back

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
With pay or like just make it

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
The game well I would assume I would

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Assume with pay if it's a new company that's

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Taking on the obligation to finish it

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
The company this new company would hire

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Them and do what they need to do

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
We'll give you some exposure yeah

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Anyway

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
D'artitsuya in chat says

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
The Telltale news for sure sucks but at the very

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Least the story gets to be completed

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Not that I'm letting them off the hook and I guess

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
That's where my mind is at

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Is I'm like okay this

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Is going to help with half the problem

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
The obligation to the customers

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Will get filled

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Even though the quality is still

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
TBD we'll give them the benefit

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Of the doubt and hope it's going to be a great

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Maybe is that going to give them more money to

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Pay these severances or are they just

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Pocketing that that would be fabulous

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
And then maybe address some of the concern

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
About what happened to the other half

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
But unfortunately the realist

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
In me is like this new

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Company has

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
No need

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
I mean has no obligation to pay

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Another company's

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Severance you know what I mean

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
And please please do not misinterpret

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
What I'm saying those people deserve to be treated

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Better but that's not this

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Company that's trying to come in and fix some of the

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Problems it's not their problem

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
They're selling the rights to this company

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
To like make the game because

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
It's their series but maybe they're

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Getting like a portion of that

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
You know those profits

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Going back to their original telltale company

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Because it's their game

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Well and then I hope that money gets redistributed to the

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Employees because the management

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
And the board don't deserve a fucking dime

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
But aren't they just finishing the

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Stories for what people have

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Already paid for yes so that

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Means there's no new money coming in

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
These people have already paid for this

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Game and what money they

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Made already wasn't enough to pay severance

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
So there isn't any new money coming in

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
To finish whatever chapters are left

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Correct so

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Yeah no it sucks so this new company that's

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Doing it isn't gonna get a dime

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Really because people have already paid for the

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Content unless new people come on

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Later and buy

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
The whole thing but

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
For the most part they're just fulfilling back orders

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Right yeah and that's why I'm like

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
The new company like even

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Though I have a hard time saying yay

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Everything is better okay I'm

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Gonna get this new company is doing a good thing

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
I think it's good intentioned and they're trying

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
To fix some of the problem what

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
They can do fixing

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
This problem with the severance and everything I don't

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Think this new company can do at least not

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Now not unless a ton of people buy

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
This game and they made buku bucks but

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
At that point I mean how long

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Before these games come out and turn a profit it's

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Probably gonna take some time you know and

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Even then these other folks hopefully will

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Have moved on but likely add to new

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Jobs it's just it's a shitty

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Situation and it's telltale management's

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Fault and it's unfortunate

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
I hope the industry

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
As a whole is kind of watching

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
What's happening to this and

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Especially how pissed off a lot of people

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Are getting about it and especially how

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
It's moving more and more game

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Makers to kind of go you know

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Maybe we do need to unionize

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
And it could be very interesting if this

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Is gonna be the the straw that

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Start or the what was

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
An analogy I can use here the rock that starts

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
The avalanche so to speak with that whole thing

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
So all right

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Let's move on one more thing here before we get to the classic

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Game of the week I want to talk about a beloved

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Game from the past I don't know about you guys but I

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Always love this game did you guys ever play a game called

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Descent on PC?

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Yeah it was pretty cool because it kind of came out

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
In that first person era when

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Doom and Wolfenstein really started

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Taking off but Descent was really

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
The first game that had the full

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
360 degrees of movement

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Cause like in Doom you move forward

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Back side side but in Descent

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
You were a ship and you flew

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Around rooms and you really had

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
360 degrees of movement so they

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Made a few Descent games within the series

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Kind of went kaput well

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Apparently a new Descent

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Game is coming out next year

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
On PC and consoles

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
So it was announced by

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Little Orbit who is a independent

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Video game publisher and Descendant

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Studios they are making

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
A reimagining of

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Descent you will be going through

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Twisting tunnels and caverns

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Where again like the originals up and

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Down is you know you're gonna

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Move all over the place you have to be able to think

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
In 360 degrees

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
So anyway they say

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
This is actually a Kickstarter project from a long

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Time ago so it took about 3 years

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
To get here but the retail and digital release

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
For PC, Xbox One, and Playstation 4

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Is early 2019 the

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Switch is now included in this so you can

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Play Descent if you wanna you know throw up on the

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Go by spinning in all those different directions

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
You can do that if you

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Pre-order now you will get access

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
To a PC beta starting later

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
This year a custom version of the

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Generation 3 Voila ship

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
With a new paint job

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
PC beta challenges

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Multi-pass upgrade for multiplayer

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Secret missions DLC

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
You know all the extra crap they tack on to games

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
These days so anyway kind of

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Neat the Descent is coming back and

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Always nice to see a Kickstarter come full

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Circle and actually get its release

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
And be fully realized which sadly

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Doesn't happen 100% of the time

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
But we're getting there

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Would anyone want to check out the new Descent game

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
I'm curious about it

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I love the old one

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Sorry I was texting with my wife apparently they launched

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
A Falcon 9 rocket near by

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
You can actually see it outside

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Really? Yeah

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Yeah pretty close like

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
She sent me pictures she's like what the hell is that

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Why are they launching rockets

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Fuck if I know

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Random

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Delvin I hope your trip

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
To the US doesn't end in tragedy

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Why are they launching no I'm

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
I'm obviously kidding but

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
It's neat that they bring back I remember we were talking about that

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
When they first announced that they were doing that

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
I mean I

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
I never really liked the original Descent

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
I had like the demo for it it came out like one of those PC gamer

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Discs or something like that

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Back when they used to do that I don't know if they still

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Do those but

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
I don't know I just never really got

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
It was hard enough for me to control like

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
First person shooters let alone a

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
360 first person shooter

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
But

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
I never played the original

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
I never heard of the game so

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
I mean if there's a demo I'll

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Check it out but other than that

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Probably not cause is it kinda like a

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Like a Star Fox type

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
I wouldn't really call it Star Fox like imagine if

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Star Fox was Doom

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Kinda a little more like that it's a little more realistic

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
I suppose than talking animals

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Well no I'm not I just mean in terms of like

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
It's a flying shooting game

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Yeah but you move like you might wanna go to a room

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
That's above you so you actually fly up

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Where as like Star Fox was still kinda

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Like on rails a bit

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
You know what I mean like this gives you the full

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
360 degrees of motion

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
So I mean it'll probably be like a very kinda

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Competent space shooter game

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Multiplayer was a lot of fun though I will say that

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Because that was also the day when you know

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Modems and BBS's you'd hook up through that

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
And you could play like 4 player Doom online

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Or Duke Nukem

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
And that was a lot of fun too because you could

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Hide above somebody

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
In a game like Descent so it might be neat

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
We'll see anyway uh

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Let's move on to the classic game of the week you know

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
One of these weeks we'll have to do Descent

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
As the classic game of the week but I don't think

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
That is what Dark Soccer has in store

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
For us this week let's go ask

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Jamie Summers what the classic game of the week this week

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Will be

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
So we take a

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Step back in time

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Figuratively and literally

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
In the classic game of the week

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Where Dark Soccer is here

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
It's magic you just appeared

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Delvin disappeared and you appeared

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Oh my god where did Delvin go

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Well through the magic of space and time

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
He's actually not here yet

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Right he gets to see me

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
As a nun but yet he's there I know

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
It's going to be a very exciting weekend anyway

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Let's continue this exciting weekend

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
By talking about actually it's going to be way more exciting

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
For us because we're going to Reno

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
That's where the nuns go I saw that Whoopi

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Goldberg movie Sister Act

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Reno and Gamora

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Nuns in Reno are nuns

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Alright anyway

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Girl

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
It's the classic game of the week Dark Soccer

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Is going to take a trip back and walk into the vault

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
And find a game that she thinks hey

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
You should get to church

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Or play this game

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Or cry like the poor Oppa Oppa

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Or I will slap you with a ruler like nuns do

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Alright it's the classic game of the week

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Dark Soccer what did you pick for us

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Actually did you know you want a fun fact

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Before we get into tonight's classic game of the week

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Fun fact for the listeners

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
So we were having dinner earlier this evening

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
As people do sometimes

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Dark Soccer and I went on a date

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
So Delvin was there too so it was a triad date

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
But anyway we were eating and we were

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Talking about this segment the classic game of the week

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
And we were wondering how long is it

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Until the classic game of the week

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Can be the classic game of the week

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Like is this segment so thanks to the

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Wonderful people that maintain the wiki

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I went back to the wiki and found out

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
This week October 7th

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
2007

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Was the first classic game of the week

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
So it's actually 11 years old

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
This week

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
So I'm doing the classic game of the week as the classic game of the week

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
I'm kidding I'm not

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Do you know what the very first classic game of the week ever was that we did

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
I believe it was Fantasy Zone

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
It was Fantasy Zone

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
So tonight for our 11th anniversary spectacular

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
We're doing a sequel

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
That's Fantasy Zone 1-1

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
We're doing Fantasy Zone 2

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
The Tears of Oppa Oppa

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Oh it's not Electric Boogaloo?

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Or as it was called Oppa Oppa

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Non Amida

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Which basically means Oppa Oppa Tears

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
And I'm actually kind of doing 2 and 1

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Because I wanted to do the System 16 remake

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
But to do that I have to talk

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
About the Sega Master System

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Which this is one of the few

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Times where the game has come out at home

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
And then years later they remade it

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
For the arcade

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
There's a lot of situations where that's happened

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
I mean maybe things like Street Fighter V

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Question mark

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Maybe

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
In modern times that really doesn't happen

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Well at any rate

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
This was a Sega Master System game

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
That came out in 1987

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Of course it was a Sega game

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
It was ported to the arcade

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Ported to the arcade

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Famicom and MSX

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
And then there was a remake

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
For System 16 hardware

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
population in 2008

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
It had virtual console releases

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
But we're going to

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Go a little bit more

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Into what this game is like

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
So Fantasy Zone 2 does play

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Like the first Fantasy Zone

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Where it's defender style

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
You have a continuously scrolling screen

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
You can go back and forth

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
And shoot down little bases

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
And it does qualify as a shooter

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Not really fond of that term

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
But anyway

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Now this game has such a fucking

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Convoluted storyline

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Oh my god Rob it has like three endings

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
People play this game for the story?

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
One of the endings

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Spoiler

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
I play it because it's a cute shooter

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Oh my god you're going to spoil a 30 year old game

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Opa Opa turns evil

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
And kills the space Harrier

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Opa Opa loses to his evil self

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Evil self takes over

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
And the space Harrier

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Which you know is set in the same universe right?

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Opa Opa tries to go to knock his ass out

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
And Opa Opa kills him

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Funny enough that was also the ending

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
I'm sorry to spoil this guys

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
But that's also the ending to A Star is Born

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Is that Gaga turns evil

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
And turns into the evil leader of the planet

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
And makes everybody bow down and say

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Yes Gaga yes

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
That's basically what it is

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
And then she interrupts my Fantasy Zone music

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
And then Changela comes out of the box

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Yes Hallelu

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Anyway

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
So basically the story of this

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Is in the year 1432

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Space year 1432

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Ten years after

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Ten years after

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Fantasy Zone

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Opa Opa has to go in

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
And save the Fantasy Zone again

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
So the mastermind of this

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Is an evil version of himself

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
And then after winning

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
God Smooshy what?

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Can we hear him?

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
I don't think he picks up on the mic

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Mr. Smoosh is throwing a fit

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
He's screaming

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Anyway Opa Opa's father comes out to

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Comfort him

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
And Opa Opa cries

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
And so the evil Opa Opa vanishes

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Mr. Smoosh is just playing along

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
And he's singing along

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
But you get to see Opa Opa's daddy

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Which is a big ginormous Opa Opa

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Alright well Mr. Smoosh's daddy is going to go over there and tell him to shut the fuck up

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
I'll be back

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
So anyway as I said

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
You play kind of Defender Style

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Indefinitely

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
And you can travel freely

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
You've got different bases that you have to knock down

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
And you pick up coins

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
And you can go into secret shops to buy stuff

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
But now what's new in this one

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Is that you get different warps that are hidden behind

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Certain bases that let you travel to different zones

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
So you have three different zones

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
And when all of the bases have

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
disappeared and all three of the zones

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Are available

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Then you can go through a warp to get to the boss

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Now the boss fights are just simply

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Like the way that they were in fantasy zones

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Where you have to kind of be

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Sort of bullet hellish

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
You know shooting at big bossy things

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
And then

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
They are super huge and they change color

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
And then your last stage is a boss rush

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Which is kind of a pain in the ass

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
So you get different types of attacks

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
You have a fire and you have a bomb

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
The bomb kind of drops

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Like in an arc

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
But it is more powerful and has a shorter range

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
You get the shops like I said

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
You can get different weapons

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Bombs, speeds, extra lives

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
You get the large wing

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
And the jet engine

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
The large one is probably one of my favorite ones

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
So the ones that upgrade

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Over open speed are permanent

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
As long as you do not die

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Weapon upgrades are time limited

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
And the bombs have a limited number

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
So here's where we get to the fun part

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
All the ports

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
So it passes into our cave

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
The first one is based on system A

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
So it is almost identical to master system version

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
It does have the radar that shows

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
The base of the destroyer pod

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
And of course

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
It has a timer because

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Pretty much kind of like

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Like those play choice games I guess

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
The internet

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
The Famicom version

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
That came out actually has

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
A kind of different name

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
It's called the teardrop of Oppa Oppa

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
So now we have the big one

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Which really is the one that I wanted to talk about

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
So now keep in mind

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
The first one came out

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
In what did I say

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
2000 not 2000

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
1987 right

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
So in 2008

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
So 10 years ago

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
They

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Re-released the game

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
They did it in the system 16

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Which is

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Basically the

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Same original hardware

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
It was

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
It was developed by M2

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
And it's not really

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
They didn't want to modernize the older one

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
They wanted to do a hypothetical interpretation

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Of what the game would have been like

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Had it been developed for

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
System 16 arcade hardware

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
By the original staff

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
That's kind of neat though

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
It is

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
So instead of using the Sega console

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
R&D system

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
And system E board for the system 16

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
It was called a what if remake

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
And basically it adhered

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Strictly to the limitations

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
From the time that fantasy M2

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Was originally released

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
But with the arcade hardware

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
At that point

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
So M2 developed it on a real

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
System 16 hardware

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Except that it had expanded memory

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
256 kilobytes

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
So it was called

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
They dubbed it system 16c

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Well I mean that was pretty hot shit for

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
No yeah for that time

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Now it's just funny like 256 kilobytes

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
It's like I have word documents

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
That are far bigger than that you know

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
It's crazy

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
On top of that it actually can be played

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Via emulation

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
And on top of that it shows a 1987

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Sega copyright and makes no mention

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Of M2

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
So it really

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
And I played the system 16 arcade remake

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
I played it at

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
California extreme

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
I played the shit out of it at California

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Extreme cause I fucking love some Fantasy Zone

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
And when I first looked at it

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
If I hadn't seen it say the tears of

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Oppa Oppa I would have thought I was

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
About to play the real Fantasy Zone

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
And I was like oh wait shit this is

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
That one

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
So it's been nicknamed by fans

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Fantasy Zone 2DX

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Nice

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
So it follows the original one

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Kinda loosely it has the enemies

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Music locations and gameplay from

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Master System game that has

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
New content and elements that went

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
With the original Fantasy Zone it's actually kinda why I like

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
This one better cause it's more like the original Fantasy Zone

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
So level structure is the

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Same so instead of distinct zones that you

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Have to beat you actually have portals

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
That take you into parallel dimensions

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
You have the bright side and the dark side

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
And they're comparable to the levels

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Of the first Fantasy Zone

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
So you can destroy them in each dimension

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Jeez okay

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
So bases

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
That are destroyed in one dimension will be destroyed in the other

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
So you can clear entirely on one level

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Of the other but the dark side is more

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Difficult but you get greater rewards

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
And points and money

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
The bosses are the same on either side

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
But they have a more difficult

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Attack pattern on the dark side

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
It also has three endings

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Based on which

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
On both whether the dark side levels

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Were cleared and whether certain specific

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Items were purchased so that's where

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
You get like the you know daddy comes

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
And helps Oppa Oppa

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
And then evil Oppa Oppa

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Takes over and there's like one more

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
The music was done by

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Manabu Namiki

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Sorry Manabu Namiki

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
That uses

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Some of the songs from

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
The original Fantasy Zone 2 soundtrack

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
But rearranged to fit more

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Like Kawaguchi Hiroshi's

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
First Fantasy Zone style so

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
And there's a few original tracks

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
That were made for it

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
It's based off of some of the same

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Games

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
The

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Bosses there are some new ones for here

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
It's just sort of like again a loose interpretation

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
It's kind of like arena

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
So it has been bootlegged and re-released

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
To the arcades

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
As FZ-2006-2

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
By a Taiwanese manufacturer

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Called ISG

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
As a 2006 copyright date

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
But it's directly

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Derived from the Playstation 2 release

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
It also has the ROM data

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
From the PS2 version

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Sega did

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Actually produce

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Real arcade units running the System 16

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Hardware as part of the promotion

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
So there's a Nintendo 3DS

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Port of this version

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
16-bit version that came out in Japan

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
In 2014 and internationally

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
In 2015 and it's called 3D Fantasy

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Zone 2W

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
You also have

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Another game mode in this one

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
It's called Loop Land

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Where it's an endless survival mode

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Starring Oppa Oppa's brother Oppa Oppa

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Oppa Oppa and Oppa Oppa

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Oppa Oppa and Oppa Oppa

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Oppa Oppa

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
I just always laugh at Oppa Oppa

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Because I don't know if his name is supposed to be a ton on boobs

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Oppai

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Or if it's like Oppa

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
You know the Greek cheer

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
I think it's also a Korean word for brother

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Because I used to have a friend in high school

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Random question

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
So there you go

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
It is one of the best games

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Ever made Fantasy Zone 2

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
And as much

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
As much as I

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
I have a lot of fucking love for this game

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
And if someone wants to find me

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
The Sega Ages Fantasy Zone box

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Will work something out

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Alright

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
She'll go Oppa Oppa for it

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Also

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
I'm mad because Dan guessed

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
One of the games I got him

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
And I can't lie

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
He guessed that I got him the treasure box

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
So when is his birthday?

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
It's November 29th

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Oh gosh so are you making him wait?

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
I'm making him wait

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
That's what he gets

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Guess what he got though for us?

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
On the 27th he got us tickets to see the

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
40th anniversary

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Theater showing a superman

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
That's kind of cool

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Very cool

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Last game of the week Fantasy Zone 2

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
The Tears of Oppa Oppa

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Poor Oppa Oppa don't cry

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
We're running long so we gotta wrap up

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
So any last words for the week Dark Sakura?

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
I like big butts

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
And I cannot lie

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
You other brothers can't deny

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
I'm kidding

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
I don't like big butts

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Unless they're like rump roasts

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
I'm done

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
And we're back in the present

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Where sadly Dark Sakura did not

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
end up coming out as a nun

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Delvin didn't get to see that because unfortunately

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
I think she got a little sick before

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
we went out last night

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
I was taking Delvin around

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
I'm trying to think of how to give Delvin this Sacramento

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
experience because we don't exactly have

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
a lot. It's not like Disneyland

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
is in this part of California

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Disneyland is like six hours

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
from here. It's a long way away

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
It's pretty far

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
So I was like well we'll go to Old Town

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
That'll be fun

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
We'll go to the Capitol

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
I actually taught Delvin a little bit about

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
American government today

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Which is very confusing by the way

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Especially if you've watched the news this past week

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
You're especially looking at it going

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
How did any of this happen?

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
It's so confusing

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
US politics is just very confusing

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Canadian politics which I feel is a little bit more

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
simplistic in its design

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
But ask any of us to explain

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Canadian politics and we couldn't do it

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
I doubt I barely could

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
I would bet there would be so many Americans that would be like

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Justin Trudeau is the president of Canada, right?

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Probably

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Well, no

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Prime Minister, but close

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Close, as far as

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
delegations

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
It's got to be equivalent, but it's not the same

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Anyway

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
To register participation for this

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
vognetwork.com, use the passphrase

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Family

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Speaking of like adventures and

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
being here in Sacramento

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
So you've listened to OLR sometimes

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
And now you're here, what should people at home

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
know about what

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
OLR is really like in person?

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
It's just what it sounds like

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
That's good

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
I guess that's good, that means we're authentic

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
That's good, alright, it's an authentic product

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
I appreciate that

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Good, alright

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
And you're even getting to sit in Jamie's chair

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
I feel very special

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
It's the nicest chair in the room, isn't it?

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
That's why I picked it

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Nothing but the finest for our out of town guests

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Alright, looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
SSG100Matt says

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
I thought the Sacramento experience was watching

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Lady Bird

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
You know, as

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
somebody who's lived here his entire life

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
I did watch that movie and I was

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
obviously I nitpicked some of the

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
little things, but I was like, yeah

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
honestly, they got it

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
They

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
really got it, and like the whole story

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
of her really spoke to me

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
because I too applied to go to college

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
back east, it's just

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
I didn't get in

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Aww

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
My life turned out okay, it's all good

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
I also learned in college that college

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
wasn't for me, and that's what happens

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
sometimes, college isn't for everybody, so

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Sometimes I just don't think people should go

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
college right after high school

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
I think that is, well that's a

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
big reason why community college is a thing

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
because, and some people have joked and called

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
community college 13th grade, but

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
actually I think it really is like a good

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
transition type of thing, so I think

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
community college is really underrated in

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
many ways, but anyway, it is not that kind of

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
show, although I

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
do associate, you know what I associate community college

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
with? The altered beast machine

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
that was at the cafeteria at the community college

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
I went to and took like one or two

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
classes at during the summer, they

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
had an altered beast machine, it was awesome

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
There you go

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
What? What?

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
I guess I live a primitive life up in Canada

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Apparently, my god, you

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
really do all live in igloos with no power

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
don't you

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Alright

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Alright, let's move on, let's get into some

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
rapid fire news, Loki

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
So there's more rumors regarding

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Microsoft releasing

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
a streaming platform

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
as a new console possibly

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
next year, they're

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
saying that

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
the rumors are that this

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
console quality game

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
streaming platform for phones and other

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
devices will be released

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
sometime as early as

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
quarter one of, or quarter two

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
of next year, and

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
they're saying that there's possibly going to be an

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
announcement at EXO

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
2018 in November

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
So I guess we'll have to

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
wait and see if that actually

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
ends up being a thing

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
They don't really have a streaming

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
platform

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
I feel like it's not a void they really need to

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
fill, because they have game pass

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
which is pretty rad, but

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
okay, I mean if they

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
But what if you could do game pass on devices that

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
if you don't have an Xbox

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Yeah, I think that's the direction

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Microsoft, and we've heard this rumor before

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
that the next Xbox

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
is there's going to be one super

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Xbox, but then there's going to be a baby

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Xbox that just basically does the online

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Yeah, so I

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
one of the things that I think the direction

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Microsoft is going, and probably

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
all consoles will be going in the future

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
is no longer having us

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
like a new generation

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
and then creating a segmented

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
user base, so

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
I think that they're planning to have

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
whatever next console Microsoft

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
comes out with the more powerful

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
and whatever the case may be, but those games

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
that come out for it will work on your

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
original Xbox, but will scale

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
in the same way that you

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
buy a PC game, and even if you

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
are playing it on your laptop with

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
no video card, it will still work

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
or just like

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
you have Pokemon Go

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
on your iPhone, and it will work

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
on your iPhone 5, 6

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
7, 8, it doesn't matter

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
it just scales correctly, so

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
this streaming method

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
might be one of the ways in which they

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
allow those more powerful games to

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
run on the older systems, you just

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
stream it. Well you know a story that didn't

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
make our show roll tonight has to do with the fact that

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
the Switch is exploiting, like Capcom's

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
looking at doing something like

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Resident Evil 7 with maybe

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
more of their games, because you may or may not

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
know, but in Japan, there's more of these

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
streaming games on the Switch, and that's how

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
they've put Resident Evil 7 on it

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
and Assassin's Creed Odyssey came out

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
on the Switch in Japan. And Phantasy Star Online

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
2. Oh that's right!

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Is a streaming

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
stream game. God that pisses me off.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
That's not open, that can of worms.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
I want to play that game so bad,

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
and they just refuse to release it in the US.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Sega, what's your fucking problem?

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Like seriously.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
I have so much fond memories of that

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
game, but I just want to play the second one

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
so bad. Same.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Anyway, sorry Logi.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
So, I think

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
it's a neat idea on paper, but

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
like, you know, are

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
the United, you know,

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
North American

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
internet infrastructures

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
going to be able to handle something like this?

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
I don't, I'm

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
kind of concerned that, no,

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
they can't. I

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
would, well, okay, but remember

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
we live in Sacramento, and

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
one of the things that we're getting here, that

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
very few cities in America are getting because we're in

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
a test program, they just rolled out 5G here.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Now sadly, not where OLR Studios

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
is located, because this is in the downtown

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
part, and I'm not going to give out my address on

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
air, but I don't live downtown.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
So, the downtown area is really

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
where a lot of this is going in, because they put all the

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
boxes on phone poles. So, I mean, 5G

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
is going to give you wirelessly

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
like what cable internet gives

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
you. So,

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
here's the thing, in five years from now,

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Logi, the internet like that is only

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
going to get better, and 5G is going to roll out more

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
and more places. Will places like

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
rural Alaska

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
have that type of internet? Probably

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
not, but you know what?

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
I mean, they

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
were probably still on dial-up

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
up to a few years ago, but it's progressed.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
It's not so much the speeds. I mean,

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
speeds definitely, we need improvements

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
there, but it's also bandwidth caps

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
for no fucking reason.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Well, I kind of think

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
that argument is going to have to

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
give a little bit as more and

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
more people start getting too close to

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
that cap, but cable is really

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
probably assessing the situation right now. Like, a

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
company like Comcast is

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
definitely going. Like, the days

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
of cable as a television

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
delivery service are limited. Like,

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
that is dying. You know,

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
again, maybe in rural parts

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
where there isn't as fast of internet and so forth,

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
maybe there's still a need there, but

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
again, a lot of those people have had satellite

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
for the longest time. But, you know, people,

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
more and more people are ditching cable

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
channels to watch their shows on

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Netflix, or this is why

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
as much as people hate on CBS

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
All Access, it exists

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
because CBS saw this coming a long

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
time ago. So, they were trying to

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
future-proof against, you know what?

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
People aren't going to be getting CBS on cable.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
They're not going to be getting it over the air.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
So, we need to, you know, adopt

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
this Netflix-style thing, like, fast

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
because that is where it's going.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
So, one of the things I

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
have noticed recently

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
in terms of infrastructure

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
and internet and TV and all that sort of thing,

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
all the,

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
in Canada, the providers now,

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
all the internet plans don't

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
have, most of them don't have caps anymore.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
They're all just unlimited.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
They just limit the speed at which you get

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
the internet now. Oh, hooray. Another reason

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
why Canada is better than the United States.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Like, as if everything.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Why can't we just live in Canada? I mean,

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
seriously. You can if you want to.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
It's a bit of a process. Actually, do you know, I was like,

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
do you know how hard it is for an American to be going to Canada?

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Because, you know, there's a lot of people this week

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
that are like, I'm going to move to Canada because fuck

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
this place. And, you know what?

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
I completely understand

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
that as a reaction. But when you

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
sit down and you really start to plot

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
it out, you're like, oh shit, that's really hard

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
to do. It's complicated. And

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
it's also one of those things, and I

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
don't want to get political, but it's also one of those where I also

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
kind of feel like, no, this is my fucking

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
country too. And we are going

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
to fucking fix this problem.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
So that's also my kind of perspective, but that's my

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
I will get on that high horse at a later time.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
So anyway. But anyway, so

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
the, uh, most of the plans are

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
trending towards no cap. So that's

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
one issue for this streaming service gone

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
out the window. Um,

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
the major issue will be the

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
cap, or so not the cap, the

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
bandwidth or rate at which you can

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
download it and upload. Because

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
if you don't have good up download, then you're screwed for the

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
streaming service. But I think it's more something

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
that is going to be as a premium service. So it's not

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
meant to be for,

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
you know, Tom in Alaska, who's,

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
you know, he needs to actually

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
purchase the game in order to play it.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
He can't stream it. Which could easily be said

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
to for people north of you in Canada,

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
because there's a lot of, a lot of place

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
in Canada that probably don't have these fast Internet's.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Yeah, very, very true. Um, and

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
one of the things like you mentioned with the TV,

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
um, so one of the, uh,

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
television, major television providers,

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
CTV, uh, in

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Canada did their promos

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
in all the subway stations for,

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
you know, the fall lineup and stuff.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Normally they'll say, oh, this

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
show is airing, uh,

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
you know, Thursdays at nine.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Uh, one of the key

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
things I noticed that they did, uh,

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
in their advertising is they said it is

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
now streaming at

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
such and such a time. Yeah.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
They, they emphasize that

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
it's not something

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
that's live. It's available for

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
streaming at this time and this

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
date. Yeah. So again, trending in

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
the direction of you just now are just going to

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
get everything on the Internet. Yeah.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
No, it's interesting stuff. It's

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
going to be really interesting to see where we are in the future.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
I mean, to put it in perspective,

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
one other little tidbit that I think you guys, some of you

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
are going to find funny. When OLR

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
first started in 2002,

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
this was before VOG Network

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
was a thing. This was before All Games Radio

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
where we were at previously was a thing.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
When OLR was a

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
station where this show was

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
the kind of centerpiece of the station,

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
that's what it was originally intended.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
One of the pitches of our station

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
because we were kind of, and I'm using my quoting fingers,

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
competing with DDR

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Freak Radio, but we really weren't.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Like we were two peas in a pod, right?

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
But our thing was

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
where as DDR Freak Radio was all high

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
speed, we were dial-up friendly

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
radio when we started.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
So something to think about. When this show started,

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
there was still enough need out there

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
for there to be dial-up friendly streams

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
that you could listen to. And

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
there's a reason why I'm called Potato

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
because this show sounded like a Potato

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
if you go back to episode one, because it's saved

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
in that dial-up quality. But that's the

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
reality, is that the internet has progressed

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
that much, even since then.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
And it will continue to progress even

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
faster, even in the next five years.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
As far as this show is concerned,

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
even in the next three months, because

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
whereas we upgraded from

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
24 kbps,

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
the dial-up standard or whatever it was,

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
to 96, which we're using on VoG,

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
now we're going to be going to Twitch.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
As more and more people now

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
can just watch video on their phones.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
This is not something we could have considered doing

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
a few years ago, even.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
You know what I mean?

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
So, again, with this streaming service, it's kind of

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
just, I guess, them setting the groundwork

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
and infrastructure for something that

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
will be more readily

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
available in five years.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Anyway, rapid-fire news, and we just spent

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
probably the longest on that topic, but that's alright.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
It was good talk.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
I love how you say sorry.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
So, PUBG over the last

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
14 months has banned 13 million

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
users.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
That's one way to get your

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
subscription numbers out. Well, most of

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
the people that were kicked off the service

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
were using cheat tools.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
And then

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
apparently that's a common problem.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Well, I would assume so, if you've kicked off

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
13 million people.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
They've, of course, been

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
patching the game to fight against these

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
tools, but then there's also

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
aimbots and whatnot.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
But these were the numbers

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
that were coming out from Bluehole

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
and the Korean

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
PUBG Cafe board.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
That's an

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
interesting statistic.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Yeah.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Maybe the rampant

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
cheating is one of the reasons why PUBG

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
has fallen in the rankings. I don't know.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
But I don't play the game or Fortnite

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
enough to really get into that stan war.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
So, but it's just, it's interesting

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
they've had to ban that many accounts, and is that really gonna

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
stop them? As Jason said in the intro,

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
one goes down, two more

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
come up, you know? Well, I think one of the things

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
that killed the PUBG

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
userbase was the amount of

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
people that they were banning

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
for stream sniping,

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
quote unquote, but weren't

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
actually stream sniping. Oh.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Remember that whole thing? Yeah, I do.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
That really killed that community. Yeah, that was...

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
And that was right when Fortnite came out.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
So, people were getting pissed off from one

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
and jumping right to the other. Well, but then the

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
other big thing was that Fortnite's Battle Royale

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
was free, and PUBG cost money.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
And I think, honestly, it's really not much

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
more difficult than that.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
I think for a lot, but you're right, that other

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
situation certainly didn't help. And the quality of

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
the game, it looks like too, like PUBG

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
it's not really as flat.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
It's kind of like comparing, I guess,

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
like, you know, it's not Overwatch

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
where Overwatch, you know, has

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
this like really flashy

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
art style and everything that, you know,

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Fortnite has, whereas PUBG's kind of

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
meh. It's

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
serves its purpose. It's trying to go a little more

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
for the realistic angle. Yeah, but...

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
To make success. Yeah, no, I get it.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
I get it. Alright. Anyhow,

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
let's move on to some other rapid fire news

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
including a game that's several years old

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
at this point, which is interesting because

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
it's a remake of a game that's many years old.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
But it's one of my favorite classics.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
The game Shadowgate from the

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Nintendo Entertainment System. Did you ever play Shadowgate, Delvin?

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Never heard of it. Oh, and the music is really

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
good. It was like a PC game

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
they kind of put out on the NES.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Where, like, you use the

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
controller as a mouse, basically.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
And, yeah, it's kind of neat. Anyway, they

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
remade it a few years ago and

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
I actually was a Kickstarter backer. It's one of the

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
very few Kickstarters I ever did.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
But I was like, somebody wants to make a

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
new Shadowgate game? Fuck yes, take my money.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
Because this was before we really started

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
learning about all the issues with Kickstarter.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
And, you know what, to be fair, these guys

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
they did the game. They delivered on what

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
they promised. It's out there.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
So, uh, and they're going to keep it going

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
because this new Shadowgate

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
version is going to be coming to the Nintendo Switch

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
this autumn. So they're putting out

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
the new Shadowgate on the Switch.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
It is based on the newer PC version

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
that came out a couple years ago, but they're going to enhance it

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
with a new user interface and

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
a wheel-based command system, some other

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
new features and elements as well. So

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
that is pretty cool.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Also, speaking of the Nintendo stuff,

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
remember the Switch Online

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Classic Nintendo library?

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
We knew we were going to be getting more games

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
in October, but we didn't quite know when.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Well, now we know. Those new games

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
will be arriving on October 10th.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
So Super Dodgeball,

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
NES Open Tournament Golf, and

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Sullivan's Key will be arriving on

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
October 10th. And if I were to rank

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
those, I would say probably Super

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Dodgeball is going to be the best, especially with the

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
online play. That was a really,

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
uh, it's kind of the art style

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
of River City Ransom, and it has a very

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
particular name in Japan, and somebody

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
in chat will beat me to it. But, um...

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
You needed a multi-tap to play

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
that, because it's four players, wasn't it?

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
I don't think so. You could play two-player.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
It might have supported the four-player

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
thing, but it was two-player. I think it did.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
But it was like, imagine the River City Ransom guys are playing

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Dodgeball, and it was really well done.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
The definitive version is on the Neo Geo,

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
honestly, but the NES version

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
is not bad. Because they were playing,

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
thinking way back, they were playing

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
this on

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
stage when they were doing the

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Nintendo World Championships

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
in the Oakland Coliseum.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
They were playing the four-player version of

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Dodgeball.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
I remember when I was trying to do the

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
preliminary

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
trial thing, where you had to play the three games.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
And then I would rank

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
number two as Solomon's Key.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
Some people would probably put that in first place,

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
but I think that was a pretty competent puzzler game

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
that was on the NES. And number three,

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
of course, the golf game. Trash.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Sorry, just my opinion.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
It is. It is.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Does Nintendo have Nintendo Golf on there already?

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
Uh, the actual NES Golf?

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
No, it is not there.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
So this is what you're getting instead.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Oh, on the NES Classic

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
service, but there wasn't that

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
golf thing that they did, someone

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Oh, it was, uh, that was

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
the hidden game. The hidden game was golf.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
That was the Iwata thing that somebody

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
found in there was the original 8-bit

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
NES Golf. That's what you're thinking about.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
That actually, for some reason, was not

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
put on the Nintendo Classic service, and they're

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
doing this instead, so I don't know.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
This is a golf game from much later in the NES's life.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Oh, it's not that golf game.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
No, it is not. It's a Mario golf game.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
It's basically that, but insert Mario.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Which, to think about it, if I seem to remember

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
the original guy kind of looked like Mario,

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
but it wasn't officially him.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
But there's a very different look to this game.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
So, uh, anyway.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
D'Artesia said, I assume that we won't

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
get original NES Golf.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
I don't know. They may still do that at some point.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
And D'Artesia says, I do

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
remember having Solomon's Key back in the day.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
Actually, I owned it too, believe it or not.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
So they're not gonna do the original golf because it's

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
gonna take so much programming stuff

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
for them to get to work. They can't just, like,

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
dump in a ROM or anything like that?

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
We're not doing this again.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
I'm just checking, because it seems like

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
it's an awful lot of work for Nintendo.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Not today, Satan. Delvin is here,

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
and we are going to have

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
a good time, dammit!

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Alright.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Let's move on and talk about what's coming

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
out in stores this week. Loki,

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
what will we be playing a little sooner than

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
NES Golf on the Switch?

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
And then the World Ends With You final

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
remix. Is it really the final remix?

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Is it really the final one?

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
The final for now. Final for now.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
Nintendo Switch. It's final, like, as in the

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Final Fantasy for the

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Nintendo Switch. And that

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
is what we're getting.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Alright, let's travel to Japan. And over

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
in Japan, they're gonna be getting a game called

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Varnir of the Dragon Star,

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Exodus of the Dragon

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
that comes out in a regular and limited edition.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Middle Earth Shadow of War

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
that's a price reduction in Japan this week as it

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
moves into the definitive edition.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Tactical Assault Commander

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
comes out as well, with a variety

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
of different little controllers and things like that.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
And believe it or not, Call of Duty

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Black Ops 4, you know, they're going pretty

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
hard in Japan with that as well, so they

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
get a release the same day we do,

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
as well as Europe, so that's all on the same

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
day. So Japan won't miss out on that.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
But they're actually also getting a blue

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
camouflage dual-shot

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
controller as well. And then

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
there are new PlayStation 4 pros

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
in Glacier White and Jet Black.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
I don't think these are Call of Duty themed, I think they just

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
happen to be the same day. But there's Glacier White

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
and Jet Black pros with a one terabyte

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
hard drive also coming out that day.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
And there is also a brand new

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
PlayStation VR bundle in

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Japan, so kind of

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
setting the stage for end-of-the-year

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
releases. Not really holiday releases in Japan

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
because Christmas isn't quite the same thing

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
that it is here, but I would say

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
end-of-the-year kind of positioning.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
That is Japan. Dark Soccer

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
is not here for the UK, but maybe you can help out

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Logie? Sure.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
So this week we're getting Space Hulk

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Tactics on PlayStation 4 and

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Xbox One, WWE 2K19

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
on PC, PlayStation 4

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
and Xbox One. Goosebumps

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
the game on the Switch.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
They're getting a bridge

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
constructor compilation

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
that's both the bridge

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
constructor portal and the original

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
bridge constructor that's on PlayStation 4.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
A game called My

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Riding Stables Life with Horses

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
on PlayStation 4 and the Switch.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Call of Duty

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
Black Ops 4 on PlayStation 4

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Xbox One and PC.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
And last but not least

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
The World Ends with You final remix on the

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Switch. Okie dokie.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Well before we get back into some news

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
we're going to take some time out to read

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
some of your emails.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Every

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
week you guys email us. Participate at

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com and we read some

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
of those emails live here on the air.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Actually we're pretty good about reading them all

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
unless they're just way way

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
way too long or off topic or something like

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
that, but we read them all.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
You get to be here for a mail bag segment, Delman.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Isn't that exciting? Yes. And we actually have some

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
emails tonight. You ready for it? Alright.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
I should have made you read them. That would have been fun. Alright.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Anyway, the first email tonight

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
is from DJ Rama S.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
I've never heard of this guy. He must be

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
a new listener.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Long time listener. First time caller.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
How about that? Alright. Obviously I'm teasing.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
We love Rama. So the email

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
goes like this. Evening everyone.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
I hope all is good. Two weeks ago

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
I tried to call into the show, but I just missed

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
the Skyplinas. I just got off the train.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
So if you bear with me, I have a few things to say.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Number one. Telltale Games.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
First of all, I feel really bad about

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
the employees losing their jobs like that.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
It sucks that this seems to be the norm in

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
the industry when it shouldn't be. What

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
bothers me is how upper management surprised

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
everyone about it. How do you go from

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
hiring people to firing people in a week?

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
I really think that upper management

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
has been finageling

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
the books. But hey,

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
what do I know? I have

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
this really weird feeling.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Give it about like six months

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
and there's going to be a lot of those employees

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
who are going to squawk. And we're going to

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
like there's going to be books written about

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
the fucking ups and fucking

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
downs of Telltale Games.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Because, seriously, open Twitter.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
And they're already

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
like there's just a lot. I got something

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
to say. And you know what?

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
And I'm not making fun of it. Like

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
I bet there's a lot

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
of things that have built up that people

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
have wanted to say. So I'm very let

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
it out. Let it out y'all. Someone

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
needs to make a docu-series about

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
the gaming industry in general of

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
like past employees. And

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
one of them that I want to hear from, of course,

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
is Kojima. You know,

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
I would love

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
to see some type of documentary

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
that's very real about the game.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
I'm sure there's been some, you know, if

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
you can think of it, it's been done, I'm sure.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
So I'm sure there's documentaries on YouTube

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
and things like that about the gaming industry. But I would

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
like somebody who's like really a renowned

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
like documentary filmmaker. And I'm not thinking

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
about like Michael Moore because he's a bit partisan.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
But he's very well known for his documentaries.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
But I'm thinking maybe a little more like how

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
do you remember when you saw Super Size Me?

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
I don't know if you ever saw that movie. What was that guy's name?

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Spurlock made that movie.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
And it really opened people's eyes

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
to like, wow,

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
this is why I'm fat.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
And just how McDonald's was really

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
pushing a lot of this stuff and the industry

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
in general, you know, not to pick on McDonald's, but maybe

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
a little bit. And it even made McDonald's change

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
some of their policies that they no longer

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
would ask, you know, you want to super size

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
it. And I think eventually they got rid of that and that

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
whole thing. And you've even commented on this before

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
about how like a medium drink here is like a large.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Yeah, it's crazy, right?

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
So anyway, the reason why I say that is that I would like a documentary

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
like that, but about

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
what really happens in the gaming industry.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
How a game is really made from start to finish.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Yes. And I want it to be

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
something that I could be comfortable saying.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
I 100%

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
support anybody starting

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
a gaming podcast. I want

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
voices to be out there. I want everybody to be

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
heard, but you need to

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
watch this documentary first

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
before you just start blindly saying this game

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
sucks. These people suck. All this

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
sucks. Like I want a documentary

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
that I'm going to feel comfortable saying

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
I support you doing this, but

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
first, you need to put your shoes

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
in, or you need to put yourself in the shoes of

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
somebody who's really in this. You know what I mean?

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
So anyway. Give some perspective to the gaming

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
internet. Yeah, for real.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Anyway, actdeft in chat says

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
granted super size me was kind of a hoax.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Okay, look, I realize there's always going to be

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
controversy with documentaries. There's always going to be

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
is it part, is it, was this lean one way or the other?

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
I think you all see the real point I'm

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
getting. I'm not saying make a copy of that, but I'm just

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
saying that movie love

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
it or hate it had a social impact

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
and I want to see something that

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
powerful about how we're treating people

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
that work in the game industry. Does that make sense?

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Anyway,

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
um, number two, the PlayStation classic

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
in Rama's email. I too

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
had wondered why the PlayStation classic isn't coming

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
with dual shot controllers. They're going with the

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
generation of games that didn't need them. From

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
the reactions I saw, it seems that a lot of people

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
forgot that the PlayStation originally had

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
standard controllers. I also understand

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
why people were taken aback at the price tag of

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
$99. 20 games,

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
each disk about 650 megabytes.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
All of the games are going to need at least

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
13 gigs of space at minimum,

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
at least 32 gigs tops.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Even at that price, I don't see

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
myself investing in one.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
PlayStation emulation

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
seems to be pretty well,

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
so I should be able to play them on my laptop or

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Surface 3 with minimal issues.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
Also, if you notice, the controller ports aren't

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
even USB. To be quite

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
honest, I feel that Atari has the

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
right idea with their retro console.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
USB, you can make your own games,

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
add your own extra storage.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
To be quite honest, I'm seriously considering

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
to build my own mini retro box.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
We'll see.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
So, there you go. Uh, lastly,

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
oh, I'm sorry, no, there's a few more here. Skype

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
versus Discord. Uh, because I've said

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
on the show,

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
openly, I'm considering switching to Discord.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
Uh, honestly, stay with Skype.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
A few episodes back, we tried

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
to do our show on Discord because of Skype 7

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
being discontinued, and Skype 8

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
was buggy as fuck. Honestly, it did not

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
work. There were too many audio dropout and

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
lagging, so we switched back to Skype 8,

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
and we haven't had any issues since.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
But what's interesting is that my other podcast I do

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
over Discord is fine. I think because

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
we're also streaming audio out, that could be the

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
issue, and I look forward to hearing updates on

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
the new studio streaming PC. Also,

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
I've used my Surface 3 to record my

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
podcast at conventions, so it's a great

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
little device. I

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
have considered the Surface as

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
an option. It's a good choice.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
I've considered it. Is that what you use?

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
No. No. You have a different thing.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Um, I just need to make sure it can do

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Twitch and everything. I have a Surface

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
3 Pro. I might want to bring it over.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
I might want to check it out a little. If you don't mind me poking

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
at it a little bit. You can get them cheap.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Mine was only, like, 400

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
used, and it came with everything.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Anyway, anyway, I'll get in that later.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Anyway, for what you want to do, I highly

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
recommend a Surface Pro 5 or 6.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
We can talk offline for more details on that.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Might as well just get a laptop for that price.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
And then lastly, you know

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
Rama's got something to say about Bowsette.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
I know you're

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
tired of the meme, and I know this has crossed

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
deep into your neck of the woods. For what it's

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
worth, it's gone deep into the anime

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
and cosplay fandom. I'm seeing

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
some great cosplays from this, with cosplayers

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
doing many variants, and I love it.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
I know I busted your chops about it,

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
but it's all fun and games. Just

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
let us, the anime fans, enjoy

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
this. Here's the thing.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
I'm not going to tell anyone what they can or can't

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
do for fun, as long as they're not hurting anybody.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
I might argue that this

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
is hurting my eyes.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
But jokes aside,

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
y'all can have your fun, but I

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
am going to sit there in my rocking chair,

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
and the minute someone in a Bowsette cosplay

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
comes up, I'm going to say, get the hell

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
off my lawn.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Give me that, alright?

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
Love and hearts

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
and XOs, I mean it. Alright, anyway,

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
back to the email. That's all that's been

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
on my mind. Enjoying the show. Thankful for

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
the podcast. Keep it fabulous.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
From the East Coast, the York of New

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Rama. There you go. Thank you

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
for the emails. Great email.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Alright, going to

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
another email from YYR,

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
who says, hello LR.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Don't worry, I don't have a laundry list

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
of complaints this week, but I did have

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
a question for Loki.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
This is for you, sir. I'm listening.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
Week after week, you mentioned that you've

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
been playing on your DDR Extreme cabinet,

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
but as a long time DDR player,

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
I'm personally interested in hearing

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
about your progression. What level

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
are you up to now? What songs have

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
you been working on lately? Now that you're

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
playing constantly, at what rate

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
have you been improving? Are you playing

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
double, or just focusing on singles

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
for now? You know, here's the funny part,

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
is I'm not improving.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
That's the weirdest thing. I

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
always play doubles, unless

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
my, you know, kids

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
or something want me to play singles, and actually

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
it's weird. Playing doubles,

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
like, I could be used to that,

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
and I can play it for a while, and then I go and play

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
singles, and it actually really hurts my feet

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
to play singles. Like, it's just different.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
I don't know. It's...

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
But, no, and sadly, I'm not really getting

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
much better at

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
it. I have been noticing

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
lately, though, that the machine needs to be tuned up

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
again, because I'm starting

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
to get some misses on my upper arrow on the

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
left side, but that's probably because

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
it just needs to be cleaned out again. I never did clean

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
the right side of the stage, either,

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
so I probably should do that at some point,

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
but, yeah, sadly,

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
I haven't really been progressing too much further.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
I've tried to play harder songs.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
I guess that's not necessarily

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
true, because when I started playing, I couldn't really play a whole

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
lot of hard stuff.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
I've been kind of hanging around,

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
like, I

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
always do, like, the random Caprice stuff,

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
because it's just, you know,

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
random songs, and they usually would just play them on the

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
standard difficulty, but then I've been

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
lately been mixing it up when, you know,

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
DDR tends to be nice,

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
and throws in, you know,

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
hey, let's do a Legend of Max, and then followed

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
by, you know, Paranormal Survivor Max

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
on a random Caprice. I'm like, fuck

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
that, and I go and play something else.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
So, I've been trying to play, like,

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
around, like, six to eight,

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
but I find, like, the eight-footer song, especially in doubles,

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
can get really tiring,

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
and also the hard thing, too,

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
is, like, after I come home and play DDR,

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
it's after I've walked for, like, three to

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
five miles that day already,

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
and so I can tell when I'm getting tired

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
because I start missing stuff more,

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
so I don't really care about as far as, like,

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
perfect attacking anything. If I pass the song, cool.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
That's it.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
But, yeah, I haven't really noticed that I'm, like,

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
can, like, all of a sudden play Max or something

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
now. I don't, I don't think I'm as

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
good as I was before.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Do you notice your stamina improving at all, though, that, like,

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
you know, that you were really winded in the

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
beginning? Because I would think that if I were to get back into

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
DDR every day, which I really, like, I just

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
really wish I could. I wish I had a

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
situation where I could have a DDR machine in this house.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
It's just not financially

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
the thing to do, and we don't own this house,

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
so it's just not, you know, something I really want to keep here.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
And even to go out and play at an

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
arcade, like, A,

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
it, I hate to say it, it's a little weird that I'm

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
40 years old when we have these, you know,

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
you know, younger kids that are playing the game. It's gonna look a little

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
weird. Like, am I a predator? Honestly, no, because

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
after, like, watching the people play

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
Ace, they're, like, fucking hugging the bar

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
on standard difficulty shit. I'm like,

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
I'm not judging, but I'm

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
judging. Well, that's a whole

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
nother thing you're gonna get into. But anyway,

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
my point is, really, though, all

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
that aside, I mean, you guys could tell me it doesn't matter

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
all you want, but the reality is, there just isn't

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
a machine conveniently near here.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Yes, we have machines in Sacramento, but we

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
have this thing called rush hour traffic,

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
and it's gonna change your mind about a lot of things,

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
too, about what's convenient to get to an amount

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
of time. And just the area, town

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
I live in, just, there's nothing convenient.

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Like, sure, if there was, like, a DDR machine in

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
an arcade, like, right up the street, I'd probably go there

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
all the time. But anyway.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
Alright, and then, I want to

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
continue with YYR's email. I can't

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
speak for everyone, but since a significant portion

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
of OLR's audience came out of the DDR

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
community, I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
interested in learning more about your progress.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
So I hope you'll give us regular updates as you

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
pursue your personal goals.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Well, funny enough, I've been thinking, actually, the last

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
few times I've been playing, of setting up a Twitch stream

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
setup. I think you should.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
I've been looking into it, but, like, it's gonna

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
be complicated to do something like that.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
Um, because I want to do, like, a

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
multi-camera setup type thing, but...

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Well, here's my suggestion.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Start basic. Like, I know

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
you want to reach for the stars, and you know you want it

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
to be fucking primo on day one, but I'm

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
gonna also keep it real. OLR's

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
gonna convert to Twitch soon. Don't expect

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
it to be what we really want it to be

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
day one. Day one is going to be camera

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
pointed at us as we do this show,

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
like it used to be on Justin TV

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
all those years ago. Then, we might

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
start to grow more and more, but again,

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
I want to make, and I'm stressing this,

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
especially for my podcast people out there, because I know

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
there's a lot of you. I don't want to change

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
it into a video show for those of you that

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
are listening on audio. It's still Orange Lounge Radio,

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
it's just that you can watch

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
us do it on Twitch if you want, but, you know,

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
that's all gonna grow with time, and so forth.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
So anyway, my point is, that's

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
great you want a multi-camera setup. You don't need

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
it day one. Right, I know that.

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
And it's just, um,

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
and not necessarily

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
multi-camera, like, I would just want, like,

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
you know, a camera and a

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
screen capture type thing, you know,

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
just so you can see that, but, like,

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
I don't know who would want to watch, like, me,

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
like, you're fucking tired,

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
you know, oh shit, look

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
at me, I barely passed the seven-footer,

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
ooh, you know, it's like,

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
yeah, but, you know,

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
I'm fucking tired, because I've been

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
exercising all day. Okay.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
So, here's the thing,

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
here's the thing.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
I streamed Forza Horizon 4 this week.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
Number one, I'm terrible at Forza Horizon 2.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Forza Horizon. Number two,

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
I still love it. Number three,

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
Travis Donovan decided to crash my game,

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
because that's what Travis Donovan does, and as

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
I was driving off a cliff, he fucking pushed

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
me off of it, live on stream, he drove

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
his car into mine and pushed me off the cliff.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
Now, as much as, so, it was

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
honestly, it was terrible. We weren't progressing in the

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
game at all, it was just, but,

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
damn it, Loki, it was the funniest

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
fucking thing. Like, even I had to look

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
at it and go, okay, this is funny, because, like, I can't

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
get up the hill, and then Travis comes and pushes me off the

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
fucking cliff, and it's funny.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
So, you know what, you don't always have to be good at the games.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
So, so, honestly,

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
Loki, just title your stream

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
Old Dude Getting Back into

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
DDR, and, like, people aren't gonna give

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
a fuck. Well, it's like, was it the one dude that, I don't even

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
remember the guy's name, but, like, he was in the Kotaku

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
article just this week, or something, about,

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
like, how he lost 125 pounds

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
playing DDR. It's, like, pretty much

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
just what I'm doing, except he's been

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
doing it slightly longer, like, he bought a

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
DDR machine, he's losing weight,

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
he's also eating dieting, he's lost

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
weight, and it's like, god damn it,

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
that's just the shit I'm doing, you know, so.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Document it all.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
And then, make a YouTube channel, and

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
now you have a sponsor, and so on and

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
so forth, you never know. Let's not get crazy.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Alright, um, S2100Matt also

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
points out, you're doing something that he doesn't

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
see on Twitch, you're playing doubles,

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
most DDR people do singles.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
And most people perfect attack, and I

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
am not gonna be perfect attacking on my machine.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
It's okay, you don't have to be the best.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Because that machine

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
ain't capable of perfect attacking,

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
I think. This is going to sound

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
shady, but I know he would

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
support me 100% in this statement,

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
so hopefully he's out there listening still.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
If Bobby Blackwolf can stream,

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
you can stream.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
I'll consider it.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
I would not have said that in a bitchy

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
way if I know he didn't 100% support me.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
I have been thinking about it, and I've been like

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
looking at my garage, and like, how would I set this

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
up? I need to replace some lights and stuff

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
because it's really dark, but

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
I have been considering it. I may do it.

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
And it would

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
like, get me to

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
play even more.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
But I mean, I just shit, like, fucking

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
the other day I walked five

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
miles, and then I come home and I play

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
DDR for like, 30 minutes.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
And the problem is, like, you know, after you've walked that long,

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
you know, during the day, it's like

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
hard to play for an hour.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
So.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
You can get your kids involved, too. That could be fun, too.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
That could be fun.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Yeah, I guess, yeah.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
But there's also weirdness about putting your kids on video like that.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
They don't really know how to play.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
I mean, my one son's sorted.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
That's the entertaining part.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Beginner mode, but then they get bored with it

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
pretty fast.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Alright. Anyway, and ActEftInChat

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
says, I think Blackwolf acknowledges his lack

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
of skills when playing most games. He probably doesn't

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
mind as long as he's out of fun.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Exactly. I do need to get into it. I just need to

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
buy all new gear because I don't have

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
anything. Exactly. And that's why,

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
and honestly, he's not as bad

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
as games as he thinks he is. Especially when it comes to

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
using games and stuff. Well, the other thing I've been looking to is, I've

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
been seriously considering

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
changing that over into a set medium machine

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
because, um,

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
I don't know. Because

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
I'm just getting kind of

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
bored with this all of a sudden.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Hold on. I just realized something because

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
what I really think you need to do

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
is you need to talk to

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
NameRedacted, but I'm gonna show

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
you this text message here. You need

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
to talk to NameRedacted

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
about

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
this on your machine.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
And I bet that's something

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
you could do. Oh, I already know how to do that.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
Oh, okay. Yeah, that I can do.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
I just have to buy a new drive for that.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Alright. Yeah, and that's, and I

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
have, I already have that image to burn

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
that, but it's just, and I

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
thought about doing that. Alright.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
But maybe, I don't know. Anyhow,

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
YYR concludes, that's it for me this time.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Not every email I write has to be a novel.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Well, every discussion

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
has to be, apparently, though. We spent like

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
five minutes on the email. That's alright, no.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Just almost every email.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Enjoy your week and happy gaming.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Love, YYR. I inserted the

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
love in there, but, you know, he'd probably

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
be okay with that.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
Alright, let's move on. We got some

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
more news to get into, and then we're gonna

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
get to your calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
word on Skype. Loki.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Alright. Um, so this is

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
kind of interesting that

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
it's a thing, but

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
um, I'm glad it's a thing, actually.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
So, what's happening, Seattle Police

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
are launching a new anti-swatting

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
program, because, you know, swatting

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
is fucking terrible, and

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
people have been killed because of it,

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
and it's, it's really not

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
a great thing. So what they've done now

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
is they have this registry that you can basically go

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
and sign up on

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
it, and letting them know that you have

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
swatting concerns. Um,

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
then that way that they will get that

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
when there is

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
you know, a call into

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
the swat or whatever, saying, oh yeah,

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
this person's got a thing, that message

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
will pop up, and they're like, oh, okay,

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
well maybe this is, you know, a

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
streamer or something, and they'll proceed with, you

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
know, a little bit differently than they would if

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
they didn't have that sort of message.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
So, you know,

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
what they need to do, I guess,

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
if you're in the Seattle area, there's a website

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
you can go to to actually do

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
that. They have an official swatting

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
resource site, and

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
you create your

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
profile, and then flag yourself as having

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
swatting concerns, and then what'll happen

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
is they say a 911 call taker

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
receives a report of a critical

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
incident, while ensuring

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
the first responders are dispatched to

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
that call for service as quickly as possible,

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
the caller, uh, call taker will

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
simultaneously check for whether

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
or not swatting concerns have been registered

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
at that address. If swatting concerns

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
have been registered, this information can be

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
shared with the responding officers, who will

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
still proceed to the call.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
So that at least gives them kind of, like,

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
you know,

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
this is the situation I may be walking into.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
It's, um, it's

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
an interesting solution. I'm not sure

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
it's a perfect solution, but

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
I mean, better than no solution. Exactly.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Like, at least we're trying

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
something to fix this problem,

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
so I'm like, alright, let's see, it's one

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
city, let's see how it goes, because if

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
it ends up doing well, maybe, and you know,

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Seattle is a pretty big tech town,

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
home of Amazon, home of Microsoft,

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Nintendo, right, they're all in Seattle

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
area, so, you know, if this does well there,

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
you know, maybe other, uh,

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
cities will take notice, and maybe this can be something

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
that helps, um, you know, because we know

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
somebody got fucking shot, that

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
shouldn't have been shot. Yeah, they're completely

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
wrong housekeeping, so, yeah.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Yeah, uh, Pooba, that wouldn't have, this

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
wouldn't have prevented that, unfortunately, because

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
No, but, at least

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
again, it's something, we're trying to move somewhere.

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Uh, Pooba in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
says, damn, why don't we think of this sooner, smart

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
on the PD for this. Yeah.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
It's about time, right? Yeah.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Alright, um,

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
moving on, let's talk about Amazon, actually,

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
because Amazon is having to put up

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
with a, uh, leaked, uh, YouTube,

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
or, excuse me, not YouTube, actually, it's very much

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
not YouTube, but a leaked video that went up

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
of their new MMO. It was

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
2 hours and 11 minutes

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
of streamed footage of their project

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
called New World.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Now, we know New World exists,

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
they've talked about this project before,

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
but what's interesting about it is that, uh,

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
it was, uh, originally put out

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
there as a Google Drive file.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
The video then went to Pornhub

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
as backup in case

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
of removal, because you know how, like,

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
interesting things end up on Pornhub

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
sometimes, right? Like,

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
not just the obvious,

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
but you know how sometimes people will

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
put, like, legit video on there,

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
and some have even joked that,

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
like, the company that could take on

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
YouTube is Pornhub. 100%.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
I wholeheartedly agree,

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
because they own, like, a lot of the

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
streaming services, like the different

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
porn streaming services,

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
so they, they own

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
a lot of them, and, I mean, all they have to do

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
is put out one that's not a porn service

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
and, boom, they've got the infrastructure

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
for it. Yeah.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
Anyhow, the footage did get taken down

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
from Pornhub, aw, but, uh,

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
3800 people viewed it, and

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
you know, of course, now

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
it's spreading throughout the internet. Now it is on YouTube,

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
and, or, excuse me, there's, like,

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
an edited version on YouTube. Some

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
YouTube users took the footage and kind of, like,

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
compressed it down to, like, 11 minutes,

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
and have done their own, uh, thing.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
So, anyway, what we learned about New World from the leak,

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
it's a third-person survival MMO.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
There's resource gathering, crafting, action,

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
combat. Uh, the concept behind

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
it is that you are settling a new world, and you

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
join forces with other players, uh,

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
to form companies. You could be mercs,

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
prospectors, craft people, architects.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
You claim territory and fight against

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
raiders. So, it's kind of like

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
a civilization-esque type of game,

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
but mixed with, like, I don't know,

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
DayZ or something?

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
I don't know, like, a survival type of thing.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
Anyway, um, Rust.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Also, what should be noted,

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
speaking of PornHub and the fact that

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
interesting videos go up there, in 2015,

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
there was leaked Fallout 4

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
footage that made there.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Um, because, I guess, it, uh,

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
it takes a little longer for copyright

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
strikes to hit on PornHub.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
They're a little slower to act, because they don't usually

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
get this type of stuff, whereas, like, YouTube, you know,

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
tends to put stuff down,

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
even if they maybe don't necessarily need to.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
So, anyway,

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
kind of interesting. I don't know if we, I don't think

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
we have a date for New World. I think it's something that's

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
still being worked on. Um, it is

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
being made, um,

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
um, who is making this game?

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
I thought that Amazon had

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
a studio, but all I see is Amazon's

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
game. Anyway,

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
alright, well, let's

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
move on. Loki, uh, let's talk

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
about the next story. Yes, so, the Switch,

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
of course, you know, has been hacked, and

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
with that, RetroArch

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
has been added

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
to the system, so, they've got,

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
um, development now of it, I

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
guess, has been going on

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
for a while. Now, they have the

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
latest version that runs on the Switch,

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
and, of course, for those not familiar, RetroArch

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
is a multi-system

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
emulator, and

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
so, you can do all sorts of things, like, they have

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
the PSP, you know,

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
you can do, um, Super

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Nintendo, Nintendo. In fact, actually, I run

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
RetroArch, um, my, um,

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
SNES Mini.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
So, but,

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
it's interesting to see, though, that they have

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
all sorts of things running on there. Legend of Zelda,

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
Okuri, and Tine, they have the screenshot of that.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
Um,

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
Ridge Racer, they're saying, you know, you can

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
even do split-screen Ridge Racer

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
on that, each person has a controller.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
Um,

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
lots of cool stuff, but,

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
I don't know. I mean,

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
I'm not surprised that they have emulators

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
running on a system.

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
I mean, it's capable of it, which is, you know,

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
makes sense.

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
The real question is how long before Nintendo

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
shuts it down, but I guess they can't, right?

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
It's like a permanent, which might

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
also be the reason why they're putting out a new thing in 2019.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
Exactly. Yeah.

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Um, here's another reason that they might want to do that

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
as well, because not only are you going to be

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
able to run your emulators,

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
but you can also run mods in

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Skyrim. That's right.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
So, they have a tool called the Skyrim

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
NX Toolkit that allows people

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
to port over mods that were made

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
for other versions of the game

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
for the Switch now.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
And, of course, the more popular mods

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
that are working with that,

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
are body mods!

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
So, the big-breasted naked chicks.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
Hooray.

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Going into Skyrim,

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
because that's...

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
Everybody wants sexy Skyrim.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Well, not everybody.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Oh, sexy Skyrim! Okay, yes.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Well, they also said,

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
the sexy mods have triple or more

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
downloads than everything else.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
The other thing that they have is the intro skip mod

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
that they uploaded about 37 times.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Oh, a practical, useful thing.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
Yeah. But nobody cares.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
Sexy armor, and

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
all sorts of other skeleton mods.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
And speaking of Skyrim,

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
and then previously Pornhub, I'm surprised

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
the amount of Skyrim porn that exists

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
out there. I did not know that was a thing.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
There's a lot of, like, everything

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
porn out there. Like, there's, like, Zelda

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
Breath of the Wild porn. There's, like, you...

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
I mean, again, you think... No, but I can, like,

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
made in the Skyrim engine.

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Oh, that they actually made it in... I think I've seen

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
Skyrim. Like, they made porn.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
They do a lot, yeah.

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
In the engine, that doesn't really

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
lend itself well to the engine,

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
but they do have mods with sex

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
in them, and then they also have,

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
I'm sure,

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
I don't know, a lot of people use, actually, funny enough,

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Source Filmmaker for

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
porn stuff.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
Like, they'll use that to make stuff.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
You know what? As soon as Super Smash Brothers

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
Ultimate comes out, within, like, two days, we're gonna have

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
Super Gangbang Ultimate. Like, it's just

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
a matter of time. Just wait for it.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
And then, within three days,

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
Bowsette will be there, even though she's not in the game.

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Yeah. Speaking of which, I saw there was a version

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
of Mario 64 that someone

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
modded Bowsette into, and you can play as her.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
Granted, she looks

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
a little bit more, um, Bowser

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
than Bowsette, but, you know.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
Moving on, let's talk about Castlevania.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Uh, there's a new Castlevania

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
portal. That's right, Konami,

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
not the portal game, sorry, meaning, like, a web

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
portal. Konami did launch a

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
Castlevania, like, website, basically.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Um, because if you go to this Castlevania

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
portal, you get to see a whole, like, timeline

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
of the series.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
Uh, there's a big gap between 2014

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
and 2018, which is, you know, sad,

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
but that's the way it is. Uh, we do see

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
the rebirth of

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
Castlevania with the new, uh, you know,

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
Requiem that's coming out on PlayStation 4.

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
Um, but anyhow,

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
thanks to the new Castlevania series

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
on Netflix, thanks to Simon being

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, uh,

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
more people are getting, you know, re-interested

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
in Castlevania, I think. So,

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
Konami's created this website to, kind of, educate

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
people a little bit on Castlevania,

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
but there is a section called

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
New Product.

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
Hmm. Oh, boy. I, I,

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
I can't wait for the new Batista

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
lot machine. Oh, God.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
Of course, of course. So, uh,

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
who knows, maybe there'll be a Castlevania

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
new game in the works,

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
and hopefully it's as good as,

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
like, maybe when they redid Bomberman,

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
because I know when we think of Konami

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
lately, we don't have a lot of positive feelings,

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
but, to be fair, the Bomberman

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
game was a'ight, so

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
we'll see if the Castlevania thing

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
is good, too, hopefully.

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
That's more Hudson, though, but, you know.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
Yeah, well, maybe, maybe they contracted with another

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
studio to do it. Who knows? We'll see,

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
I guess. Well, Castlevania

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
Requiem is not going to use the

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
original localization for

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Symphony of the Night, so be warned.

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
If you were looking forward to some of the

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
infamous voice acting, it's not

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
quite the same, because, uh,

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
the PSP, uh,

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
English version is the one that's going to be

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
in there again. So, if you were waiting

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
for the What is a Man? Nope.

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
You're gonna get the redone voice lines

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
from PSP's Dracula X Chronicles.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
That is also the

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
same for Rondo of

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Blood. So,

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
um, well, that's too bad.

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
But, um, not surprising either,

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
especially after the Silent Hill remake, so

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
there's clearly something going on with the voice actor

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
rules and all that stuff, so.

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
Alright, a few more stories for you guys, then we're gonna

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
get to the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
all one word on Skype. But first, Loki.

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Yes, but first we have to talk about the

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
final conclusion of what,

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
you know, fighting games are going

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
towards. So, you may notice

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
that with each fighting game that comes out,

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
we're pushing the boundaries of

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
outfits and

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
what scantily clad,

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
you know, outfits

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
the characters have and the boob

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
physics and stuff like that.

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
Well, it's only a matter of

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
time, and the time is now,

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
that a game should

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
exist called Naked Fighter 3D.

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
And it is a one-man project.

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
A one-man indie project, you may

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
will. It's a turn-based

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
fighting game where you

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
fight naked people

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
against naked people.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
That's right. You can

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
fight women against men, against

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
transsexuals, whatever you

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
want. With a custom

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
character creator,

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
I don't know. It's a unity

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
thing, I guess, now, but

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
if you want to check it out, they've got a demo.

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
And they have, like, skill trees

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
and stuff, and there's- Boy, I can't wait.

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
It's just-

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
Is there a dong slider? There is a

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
dong slider for both male and female.

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Okay.

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
I'm just gonna let the internet

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
have its thing. It can just, the internet

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
just, it can exist.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
Well, they'll make, inevitably,

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
Naked Bowsette.

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
I'm curious, like, how a turn-based

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
fighting game works, though. Like, how's

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
that, you mean?

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
I'd be curious to see how that plays.

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
But this is weird.

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
I guess it's like a Final Fantasy type,

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
you know, fight, select

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
option, slap,

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
kick. But if you're

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
interested, they have a Patreon.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
So Patreon.com slash Naked Fighter

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
3D. For more information,

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
you can go download that demo, and

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
go check it out.

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
Bobby Blackwolf asked, why didn't you download the demo,

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
Logie? Um, I did.

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
I haven't played it, though. Hey,

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
I got to. I gotta try it.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
For research purposes only.

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
Gotta see what it is.

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
I'm curious, like, how a turn-based fighting,

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
like, how- I mean, I'm curious, too.

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
How do you make a turn-based fighting game?

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
We're all a little curious.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
I mean,

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
I've already seen the videos. The videos are

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
goddamn ridiculous, you know, with the sliders

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
and everything, but, um,

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
yeah.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
It's a thing.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Alright, uh,

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
anyhow, one more story for you guys before we

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
open up the Skype line, and this has to do with

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
Steam, uh, and the removal

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
of minigames. Speaking of, like, porny games,

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
Steam has recently removed

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
179 games,

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
uh, and this is probably from

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
the whole, like, if you're trying to troll purposely,

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
it's nice to see they've finally

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
maybe gone back a little bit on the whole, like,

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
well, things on Steam should offend you

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
and that whole bullshit thing that they were-

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
their line was recently.

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
But anyhow, uh, apparently,

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
about 179 games have been removed in the past

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
few weeks, including such titles

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
as Make Border Great Again,

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
Big Dick,

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
Milf, Hentai Sisters,

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
Putin, Boobs,

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
and Trump. I mean, I was looking forward to

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
that one myself. Uh,

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Logan versus KSI,

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
which is, I don't know what that means,

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
and my life is probably better for it.

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
Um, Logan Paul and KSI, they

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
did a boxing match. No, okay, I got it.

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
They're two YouTubers.

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
Uh, 31 different games that have some

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
variation on the title Achievement Hunter.

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
So, anyhow, now we have an

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
idea what Steam means when they

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
say trolling,

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
basically. So, I guess

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
that's nice. Anyway,

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
ugh.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
Yep, Steam is kind of a garbage

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
dump, uh, of games sometimes,

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
and, uh, yeah, I-

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
I think they might need to curate their

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
stuff a little better, but at least they're making some

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
attempts at it by, uh, scraping a lot of this

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
bottom-of-the-barrel stuff out of the store.

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
So, there you go.

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
Siya Tabiri in our chat suggests,

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Professor Layaton and the Mystery

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
Box. No, that's-

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
I might actually play that.

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
That sounds like a porny title, like, you know how, like,

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
they might do, like, a porn

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
take on a big, like,

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
like, Lord of the Cockring or something, like,

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
it would be- Saving Ryan's Privates.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
Yeah, Shaving Ryan's Privates, yeah.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
Yeah, exactly. Anyway,

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
let's get to the

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
all one word on

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
Skype. Um,

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
I'm trying to think, um, cause you know I run-

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
and the Skype line is open.

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Uh, since we're talking about funny porn titles,

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
you know, I run with the Rocky Horror Crowd

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
and they know some weird shit, so I think the funniest

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
porn thing I ever saw was

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
Beaver and Buttface,

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
which was Beavis and Butthead, and I

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
swear to God, one of the actors goes,

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
huh, huh, I think I'm gonna cum or something.

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
It was ridiculous.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
Anyway, Skype line is lit up,

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
let's get to it. Uh, and then

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
wow, those calls I was trying to take

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
just straight up disappeared.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
So,

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
so, the chatters are yelling at

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
me, Poopa says, Rob, no, I'm

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
sorry, but if I had to see this

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
and had it seared into my brain for all eternity,

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
guess what, so do you.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
And Dartasuya says, I'm pretty

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
sure Bowsette already has a porn

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
parody. She does. Yes, unfortunately,

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
that crossed my desk this week

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
and went

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
immediately into the trash

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
receptacle. Alright,

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
I'm trying to get some calls, dang it, Skype

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
cooperate, here we go. Hi, you're on Orange

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio,

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
who's this?

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
Perhaps we have a connection

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
on Orange Lounge Radio. Oh, sorry, I don't know

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
why my headset was muted, but it

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
was. That's alright. Hi, who's this?

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
This is Eric RPG. Hey, Eric RPG,

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
Um, just wanna talk about, uh,

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
two open world games I've been playing and

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
they're polar opposites of each other.

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
Okay, what's the first one? The first one's

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
Oh, yeah, I was curious about

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
this game, but I was- I hate

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
this thing. Really, because

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
I, it looked really interesting, but

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
I was really turned off

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
when I heard that they were selling in the

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
store this $10 thing for double

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
XP and just, and that, like,

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
double XP was kinda like what you needed

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
to really progress through the game.

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
There's a part of me that's like, just

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
tack $10 on to the

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
price of your game, stop being a coward,

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
this is what you wanna do,

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
just do it. Like, charge what

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
you're really trying to charge for the game and stop

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
all this other bullshit. But anyway, what are

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
your thoughts? The experience that you get for doing quests

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
is not as much as

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
you could get in Origins, and even

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
Origins kinda felt grindy,

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
but, like, it wasn't nearly as

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
bad as this game. That's unfortunate.

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
Because I didn't mind doing the quests then.

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
But, um, I don't have the kind of time

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
the game demands for me, and it

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
is sorta like, like, like a pay-to-win

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
game where you, where they basically

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
are cajoling you into paying

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
for the experience booster.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
Which was, which

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
is something that didn't exist in a previous game.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
But, um, that

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
along with the fact that the game is very

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
repetitious to begin with,

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
like, sure, there are some unique

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
quests that you can do that, like,

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
give you decent rewards, but most of

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
them are pretty much, go

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
here and kill a lot of dudes.

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Or

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
steal something, but you end up

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
killing a lot of dudes anyways, because they're in your way.

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
Well, that's unfortunate.

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
I haven't heard quite as negative

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
of a reception of the game as a whole,

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
except for the microtransactions part,

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
but I gotta admit that- That ruins it, though.

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
Yeah, no, I hear ya.

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
In the, everything else I just

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
mentioned.

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
It wouldn't feel so grindy if you

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
just got double XP out the gate.

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
And then there's

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
a game like Spider-Man, which I also

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
played. It's like, I ran in

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
the other game from Redbox

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
because no other Redbox had Spider-Man.

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
It's like, I'll do this over the weekend, because

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
I'm taking Monday off.

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
And, um,

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
I tried playing it for

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
most of Saturday, and then I just returned

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
it on Sunday against Spider-Man today.

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
And how's Spider-Man?

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
Spider-Man is everything

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
that an open world game should be doing.

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
I mean, it still

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
has a lot of that, like, stupid

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
fetch quest stuff that's more

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
busywork and doesn't have any real

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
significant story content.

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
And there's a lot of collectible

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
junk, but, um,

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
it's a lot more fun game,

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
tight controls, and,

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
like, even on my

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
base PS4, I mean, I did experience

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
some issues, but I think that has more

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
to do with the fact that I probably need to, like,

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
defrag the hard drive.

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
Because that happens after a while,

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
after you've downloaded a lot.

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
That's very true. It's something, uh, sometimes

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
I even forget to do. But you can't defrag

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
a solid state drive.

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
Yeah, I'm just using

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
a standard drive. Yeah, I hear you.

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
But I probably should just

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
get an external.

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
So, you mentioned you rented

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
Spider-Man. Do you think you're gonna end up

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
purchasing it, because you like it so much?

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
Um,

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
I'm probably gonna beat it to completion,

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
but I might just decide to

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
not do that and return it tomorrow, because

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
I can get it later, hopefully on a

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
Black Friday sale.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
Because I'll probably be playing it even after I

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
beat the main game. Yeah.

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
Alright, well, I'm very curious

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
to check out Spider-Man as well, and I'm happy to

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
hear you don't have the same microtransaction stuff, but

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
I don't get quite as into the Marvel

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
stuff as other people do, but,

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
like, or DC, really,

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
but I did, I mean, even, I say that,

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
but I did buy, like, Arkham

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
City or whatever, what was the one, the

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
open, big open world one, and it was

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
really good. Arkham

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
Knight? Yeah, that might have been it. Um, and it was,

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
it was good, so I hear a lot of

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
the, it's basically that with Spider-Man,

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
and I'm like, okay, I'm into it.

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
Yeah, um,

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
I didn't like Arkham Knight as much as

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
Arkham Asylum or Arkham City,

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
because, uh, they put it in the

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
tank sections, and I was like, this is

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
not a Batman game anymore, why is this here?

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
Maybe it was Arkham Asylum,

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
I thought that was the first game, but anyway,

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
but yeah, that's, uh, that game

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
was really good, and then I hear a lot about the Spider-Mans

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
really good too, and I see all these screenshots

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
that look great, like, the game just looks like it's really

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
pretty, so.

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
But other than that, I've been playing

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
Mega Man 11, which I think is

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
probably,

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
I'm gonna put it above 9,

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
just a little bit. Okay.

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
As, like, one of my favorite Mega Man games,

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
my favorite being the third,

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
and then 9 being

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
number 2, that would be,

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
this would be a number 3.

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
How many games are in this series?

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
Um,

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
11, plus the side games,

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
like, uh, the spin-offs

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
like, uh, X and

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
all that stuff.

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
But, um,

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
so those are my top 3, and

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
um, I do think

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
that, uh, the game has

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
a little bit of, uh,

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
it's kind of, it's kind of like

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
barebones, but, um,

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
I guess that

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
Capcom did essentially

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
what they needed to do, and

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
didn't try to overreach, just to

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
prevent themselves from screwing it up too much.

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
But I could

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
yell at Capcom for also doing the same thing that

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
Ubisoft did with

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
Assassin's Creed Odyssey that they're going to be doing

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
with Devil May Cry 5.

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
Basically the same thing.

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
Where they'll charge you money

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
to pay for extra boost,

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
experience boost, so you can get more red orbs.

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
Yeah, I just wish, if game

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
companies want to do this, they just

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
make the game $70 already,

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
and just give us the right proper

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
balancing in the game, because this is

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
just, it's just getting ridiculous.

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
And it's just, it's, I realize

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
games are expensive to develop, and they need to

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
make their money back, but,

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
like, you're shooting yourself in the foot

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
by making the money back in this manner.

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
Yeah.

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
One thing I will comment on in regards to

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
that, at least Capcom did well

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
in terms of Mega Man, is that

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
it is not priced as a full pop

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
game, so even though, yes, it is simplistic

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
in its offerings, it is

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
not charged at, you know, a full

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
$59.99, so I believe it was,

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
I don't know what the Canadian, the Canadian

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
or US price equivalent is,

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
but it was a $39.99 in Canada,

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
so I think it's probably $29.99 for you guys.

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
Probably, yeah. So, there's that

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
at least. Yeah, there is that.

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
Alright. Well, Eric RPG,

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
I'm going to let you go so I can get some more calls,

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
but thank you for your thoughts.

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
Yeah, and maybe you could tune

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
into RP Grinders'

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
podcast, where me and

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
Breakman have been doing

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.000
Mega Man Retrospective, but

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
we'll have a final episode soon

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
and we'll probably have our reviews

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
of Mega Man 11 up then.

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
Alright. And we tend to go

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
live around Wednesdays

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
at 7,

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
no, 8,

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
yeah, 8 PM Eastern.

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
Alright.

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
Check that out, RP Grinders. Alright.

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
See you later. Take care. Bye.

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
on Skype if you want to get in.

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
You can try to get in right now.

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
Meanwhile, while we're

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
waiting for, what?

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
As fast as I talk, it lights right back up.

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
Let's get to another call. Hi, OrangeLoungeRadio,

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
who's this? Hey, what's going on, everyone?

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.000
It's Rama. Hey, Rama. An email

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
and a call tonight. Two for one

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
special. Alright, what's up, buddy?

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
Okay, in response to that

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000
naked fighting game, I just

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
have one thing to say about that. What's that?

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
Excuse me

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
while I whip this out. Oh,

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
please don't.

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
No, thank you.

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000
Hard pass.

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
They have groin kicks in the game.

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
They have what? Groin kicks.

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:06.000
Well, that seems appropriate. Oh, boy.

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:08.000
Is that what you wanted to talk about, was

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:10.000
naked fighting, Rama? No, I

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.000
did that two weeks ago, but that's the story for another

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000
time, another show, and so on and so forth,

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.000
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.000
Oh, righty then.

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
Oh, okay.

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.000
You're the one that brought up Folsom

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000
Street fair. Hold on, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.000
Delvin, could you go get me the

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:28.000
brain bleach? It's in the other room.

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:32.000
Because

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.000
my brain hurts right now.

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000
It was too much.

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
It was just too much. No, I'm kidding. Alright,

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
what's really up?

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
I gotta throw my two cents in about this

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
DDR movie. I mean,

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
I'm picturing

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
the final stage,

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
the final part of the movie,

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.000
since you brought up Scott Pilgrim. They're in his

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000
warehouse. The bad boss is on the

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:56.000
left side. Our hero

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.000
is in the

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
bathroom, just getting

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000
motivated, and it's like that whole scene from

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.000
8 Mile, and you see him come out in

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
the hoodie, and they just do

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000
max 300,

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
1.5, skip.

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
That's not gonna

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000
make a fun movie.

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.000
That's not gonna be a good

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000
movie. It might.

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:20.000
I'm just, in reference to earlier

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:22.000
chat, me and Bob Coffey were talking about, they have

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:24.000
been animes with similar

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:26.000
plotlines,

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:28.000
and it worked. I mean,

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
fuck, if you've

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000
played, um,

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
Elite Beat Agents is basically the same thing.

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000
I just feel like the

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000
DDR movie is gonna be You've Got

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.000
Served, too. I really just feel

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
like that's what it's gonna be.

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:44.000
I mean, well,

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.000
if it's anything like La Machina de Baja,

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000
I will be in the front row watching it.

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
I guess I need to give it a chance

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
and see what they turn, but I just, you know, again,

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
DDR doesn't have a

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
story. Like, at least Monster

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
Hunter and Mega Man kind of, like, have

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000
stories, but DDR just, like,

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000
doesn't have a story, and that's okay.

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
It doesn't, like, it's

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000
a great game. It doesn't need

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000
a story. Well, there

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000
was a DDR manga that

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
came out sometime back.

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000
It was not an official one.

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.000
It was a fan. A friend of mine did

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
call the 10K Millennium.

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000
It was, it was really cool. It was basically

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
a DDR tournament. It was

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
a cash cow.

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000
Hahahaha.

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
But I tell you what,

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
this current idea for a DDR

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
film is a hell of a lot better than the

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
supposed one that floated around back in

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
2000. I never saw that one.

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000
What was that supposed to be?

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000
Well, according

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
to what was supposed to be with that

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000
script, it was about

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000
a boy teaching a girl

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:48.000
English through DDR.

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
Are we sure

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000
this wasn't, like, DDR Freak fanfic?

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000
No. Alright, are we

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
sure? I'm positive.

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000
Alright, just making sure. Are we very sure? Hahahaha.

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000
I'm very, very sure. I remember

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000
if I could've sworn this was

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000
discussed on a show back in

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000
the day. No, it probably was

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
and there's a really good reason I've forgotten

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
over the years.

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
What's funny is that

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000
I may not remember certain things

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000
at work, but I sure as fuck remember shit like

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.000
this. I know. I know.

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.000
Whereas I can't remember what happened on this show

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000
last week, but that's why you guys are all great.

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000
Like, some of the, I swear to God, some of the,

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
some days I feel like RuPaul around here.

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000
And I say that joke because, and Delvin understands

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.000
this, and some of you out there too, if you ever

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
listen to, like, RuPaul's podcast and stuff, like,

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000
you learn, like, just, like, he is

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000
such an old man.

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000
Like, he does not, like, he, like, seriously,

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000
Michelle's like, yeah, Carson's been playing Fortnite

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000
and Ru's like, what's a Fortnite?

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000
No, no, Rob, I

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000
can tell you exactly what happened on last

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
week's show. You had a mimosa

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.000
and you went total B-Arthur on everyone.

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000
I had a mimosa last week.

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.000
I don't remember that.

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000
We do.

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000
No, seriously, I didn't have a mimosa.

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.000
I'd remember that. Now,

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.000
last night,

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
well, I had a lot to drink.

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000
That's a different story.

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
But we're not that, what had happened was,

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
no, we're not gonna talk about it on this show.

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000
Alright.

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000
Anyway, I'm gonna let you go, my friend.

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.000
But thank you for the call, except for that one

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:18.000
part that I will have seared in my brain

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000
for all time. But,

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000
you brought it up, I'm sorry.

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.000
Bye.

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.000
Bye.

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000
Alright. That's gonna do it for the

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000
Skype line tonight. Thank you guys

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000
who were able to get through. If you didn't get through, though,

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
please feel free to send us an email.

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
Participate at OrangelaungeRadio.com

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000
is the place where you, too, can send an email

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000
and have it read on a future episode.

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:42.000
But, for now, we're gonna

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.000
proceed to wrap up the show.

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
As I always say at the end of the show, if you

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:48.000
enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000
a friend or five about the show. Help us spread

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000
the word, because we are the show where every gamer has

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.000
a voice, but if the voices aren't here,

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.000
then how can we air them?

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000
So, tell a friend or two.

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000
A nice five star review in a place like iTunes

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000
goes an awful long way, and we

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.000
excuse me, we would really appreciate

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.000
those. Delvin,

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000
all the way from Toronto, Canada,

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000
thank you so much for being here tonight.

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000
Thank you for having me. I am so

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:14.000
happy you finally got to actually be on

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:16.000
the show. You came all the way to Sacramento,

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:18.000
just to be on OLR.

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:20.000
There wasn't, like, work involved in San

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000
Francisco or anything. You came all the way

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:24.000
out here just to be on OLR.

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000
Oh, and just to see you and Alan, of course.

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
No, I love it, I love it.

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
Come back any time.

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:32.000
It might be a while,

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
but yeah. And hopefully when I come

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000
to Toronto, you can actually do

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000
an episode of Video Game Realness and I can be there.

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
Oh yeah, absolutely. Okay, work. That sounds awesome.

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
Anyway, give us the social media plugs one more

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.000
time. Where can people follow you if they want to see more of

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.000
Delvin and company?

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000
So you can see the pod, or listen

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:50.000
to the podcast at videogamerealness.com

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:52.000
You can follow us on Twitter

and we're also on Twitch, twitch.tv

slash vgrealness.

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:02.000
Please send all our best to your

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:04.000
co-hosts over on Video Game Realness. I know there's

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:06.000
really four of you there. It's not just you, but you know.

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.000
Absolutely. I appreciate you representing

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:10.000
the show tonight. I'm here.

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:12.000
All right. Where are they

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:14.000
though? Where is she though?

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000
Where is she though?

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.000
All right. Oh, and we always ask

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.000
at the end of the show, of course, if you have any final thoughts.

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000
So do you have any final thoughts you'd like to leave

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.000
our listeners with tonight?

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.000
Eh?

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:28.000
Perfect.

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:30.000
Thank you. Oh, I love

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.000
that song. It's my favorite DDR song. Okay, anyway.

02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:34.000
Uh, Loki, how about you?

02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:36.000
Your final thought tonight?

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:38.000
My final thought is we didn't do

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.000
last minute stories, but I

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000
had one thing real quick I want to talk about.

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:44.000
Okay, fair enough. Toys R Us.

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:46.000
Should we talk about Toys

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:48.000
R Us? I mean, we can,

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:50.000
but I can't believe that they're

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:52.000
now thinking about coming back?

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:54.000
After they've fired all those people, sure.

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:56.000
Well, technically, I think it's a company that's

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:58.000
selling the brand as Toys R Us.

02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:00.000
So it's not really Toys R

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:02.000
Us. It's somebody who cut up

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:04.000
Toys R Us and is now wearing them as a dress.

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:06.000
That's a Toys

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:08.000
R Us skin suit.

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:10.000
That is what is happening, yes.

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:12.000
Okay. All right.

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:14.000
My final thought is

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:16.000
I'm still trying to work on

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:18.000
game development stuff.

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.000
This hasn't helped that I've been tired

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:22.000
or had a headache for two days, you know.

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.000
But I've been

03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:26.000
working. The thing, the problem I have is

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:28.000
that I keep starting stuff and then

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:30.000
running the roadblocks of what I can and

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:32.000
cannot do by myself with my

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.000
current knowledge, and so that's kind of

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:36.000
why I keep jumping between projects, because

03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:38.000
it's just like, I get into this thing where I

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:40.000
have to, like, research a bunch of stuff, and it's like,

03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:42.000
I want to make progress now, and I'm

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:44.000
impatient with that.

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:46.000
All right. Figure it out.

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000
My final thought is I need my

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000
Pokémon storage increased to 2,000.

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000
I need it. I need it. No,

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:54.000
I don't have a problem keeping three of every

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:56.000
type of Pokémon. You have a problem.

03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.000
I was just going to say, I was like, maybe you should keep

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.000
three of every goddamn Pokémon.

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:02.000
I don't have a problem. You have a problem.

03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:04.000
You have a problem. Good night, everybody.

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.000
You've been listening to

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:08.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.000

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:12.000

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:32.000
they were all still true.
