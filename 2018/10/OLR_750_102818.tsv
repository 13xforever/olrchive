0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	22000	750 episodes, 750, that's a significant number and a heck of a lot of content from this music game turned all things gaming show.
22000	27000	From us in NorCal straight to your ears, this is still the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back, it's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	42000	This is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, episode number 750.
42000	44000	750, just like Jason said in the intro there.
44000	47000	For this, October the 28th of 2018.
47000	52000	Happy Halloween y'all out there, since I know many folks are celebrating, you know, this weekend.
52000	61000	Because Halloween's not really a lot of fun on a Wednesday, but maybe some of you guys will be trick-or-treating or maybe playing some scary games over the week, we'll see.
61000	65000	Anyway, say hello to our co-hosts, welcome back to Studio Tonight.
65000	72000	I know she's been on the show thanks to Radio Magic, but it's so nice to have her here in person during this work period.
72000	74000	Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
74000	76000	Why do we call cookies cookies when you bake them?
76000	78000	Aren't they bakies?
78000	79000	Little bakies?
79000	80000	Bakies.
80000	81000	I don't know.
81000	82000	Biscuits.
82000	84000	And then it could be get baked off bakies.
84000	85000	Not these.
85000	91000	By the way, this is a really funny story actually, I don't know, maybe it's not funny, but before we were on air tonight.
91000	93000	So DarkSakura made cookies to bring to the show.
93000	94000	Anzac biscuits.
94000	96000	Which was very kind of you to do.
96000	97000	Bakies.
97000	104000	And then she said when she was explaining them to Loki, because Loki doesn't always eat every food you put in front of him.
104000	106000	I might as well just say hi to Tag Master Loki.
106000	107000	Hi, Loki.
107000	108000	Hi.
108000	109000	So Loki doesn't always eat everything you put in front of him.
109000	111000	He's what you call a picky eater, which is fine.
111000	113000	I'm not picky, I just have a diet that I have.
113000	115000	And cookies are a lot of calories.
115000	116000	That's a convenient excuse.
116000	118000	So anyway.
118000	120000	I ate cookies yesterday, it's just, you know.
120000	121000	Alright, anyway, fine.
121000	122000	They were soy cookies.
122000	127000	Anyway, so DarkSakura, in explaining them to Loki, said they were special cookies.
127000	129000	And I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
129000	131000	You put weed in these cookies?
131000	133000	And DarkSakura goes, yeah.
133000	135000	Like totally without skipping a beat.
135000	139000	And I'm like, Jamie, you're supposed to, like, you can't do that to your friends.
139000	141000	I thought you said wheat.
141000	143000	Yeah, they're cookies.
143000	145000	She thought I said wheat.
145000	147000	Like, yeah, they're cookies.
147000	148000	They're made with flour.
148000	150000	I was like, why would you give me wheat cookies?
150000	153000	And not tell me, like, before the show.
153000	156000	Because that's an awesome thing to do for episode 750.
156000	158000	No, that's a horrible prank to play on your friends.
158000	159000	Don't do that.
159000	160000	That's not nice.
160000	162000	So I don't care if it's legal in California now.
162000	164000	Some people have issues.
165000	167000	Who could use a good stoning?
167000	169000	Anyway.
169000	172000	Jamie, how has the last month or so been treating you?
172000	175000	Yeah, same TBH.
175000	177000	Same.
177000	178000	Anyway.
178000	181000	It was a lot of pinball.
181000	182000	Really.
182000	183000	Yeah.
183000	185000	I've been trying to play my theater of magic and get better at it.
185000	188000	Dan's like, cool, I could just show you everything.
188000	189000	No, I want to learn it for myself.
189000	191000	And finally I broke down and read the rule sheet.
191000	192000	I keep forgetting.
192000	196000	They do make, like, official rules for pinball, even though, like, very few of us have probably
196000	199000	ever seen them because they don't really exactly put them in arcades easily.
199000	202000	Well, they might, like, hang them on the wall or something, but most people don't think
202000	203000	to look for them.
203000	206000	You can get them now from the, like, the pinball internet database or something.
206000	207000	The internet?
207000	208000	The interwebs.
208000	209000	Anything is possible.
209000	215000	And then Dan and I were watching the mini Games Done Quick from TwitchCon.
215000	216000	Yeah.
216000	217000	That was pretty good.
217000	219000	We watched the blindfold Symphony of the Night run.
219000	220000	Oh, that's fun.
220000	224000	And just listening to the cues, though, I was like, I see how he's doing it.
224000	227000	But you still have to have a good bit of memorization in on that one.
227000	230000	Have you picked up the Castlevania, like, combo pack?
230000	232000	I forget the Requiem or whatever they called it.
232000	233000	Not yet.
233000	234000	It's on the PS4.
234000	235000	Not yet.
235000	238000	How do you feel about the fact that they use the newer voice acting as opposed to the classic?
238000	239000	I don't mind.
239000	240000	Yeah?
240000	241000	All right.
241000	243000	I mean, the old one was cheeseball and great in its own light, but, you know, I really
243000	244000	don't mind.
244000	245000	Well, fair enough.
246000	251000	I just wish that they would, like, do an HD version of the Saturn one.
251000	255000	Yeah, that would be nice to use kind of like that as the base, even though it makes sense
255000	259000	because, you know, this PlayStation 4 that this back came out on, it makes sense.
259000	261000	But yeah, I'd like to see the same one.
261000	265000	I want to play through it as Richter or Maria.
265000	268000	I've never gotten to play the game as Maria, so I would love to check that out.
268000	272000	Actually, we'll have to have you over to do a Saturn stream.
272000	273000	That'll be fun.
273000	277000	Of Nocturne in the Moonlight, which I still think is a better name than Symphony of the
277000	278000	Night.
278000	279000	Yes, it would be a good time.
279000	282000	Because it's the same as, you know, Rondo and Nocturne.
282000	286000	They're the same type of thing instead of just a symphony.
286000	292000	Go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night
292000	295000	at the VoiceGeeks network, vognetwork.com.
295000	296000	Let's see.
296000	300000	Fifth Dream says, I make cookies with coconuts, not wheat.
300000	301000	But your-
301000	302000	These also have coconuts in them.
302000	303000	They also say they have both.
303000	309000	Actually, my dear friend JJ, who has been in the chat a few times, gave me this recipe
309000	315000	for Anzac cookies or biscuits that were, I think for World War II, that were made to
315000	320000	send off because they didn't need a lot of preservative or something.
320000	321000	Right.
321000	324000	I'll have to find the official story again, but they're really delicious.
324000	331000	They're made with coconut and rolled oats and golden syrup and baking soda.
332000	334000	Cooking with Sakura.
334000	338000	Anyway, just to make sure I get the full plug in there so that Bobby gets his free plug.
338000	341000	We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,
341000	346000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the VoiceGeeks network, vognetwork.com,
346000	347000	that's vognetwork.com.
347000	349000	Some other comments in chat.
349000	355000	MegamanX400, our pal Delvin, who was here about three weeks ago, says, come on, episode 750.
355000	357000	Woo, death drop.
357000	359000	You missed a fun episode, not being able to be here when Delvin was here.
359000	360000	It was a fun episode.
360000	361000	It was very sad.
361000	364000	I was also really sad that I was so sick the day before.
364000	365000	Oh, yeah.
365000	366000	After brunch.
366000	367000	Oh, yeah.
367000	368000	But we got to go.
368000	369000	At least you got to meet him.
369000	370000	We got to all go hang out and that was fun.
370000	371000	Yeah.
371000	372000	It was good times.
372000	374000	Anyway, let's get into our video game kickoff topic.
374000	376000	We actually have like a couple of smaller topics tonight.
376000	381000	Well, first, I really actually, even before the kickoff topic, the pre-kickoff topic,
381000	384000	the singing of the national anthem part.
384000	388000	Let's talk about the fact that we are episode 750.
388000	390000	I mean, it's kind of a landmark number.
390000	394000	There's not a lot of gaming podcasts that have gotten this high in number.
394000	396000	Or have gotten this high in general.
396000	401000	Well, here's the, if you want to get technical, if they're only weekly, I mean, we've been
401000	406000	running the longest since 2002, just about every week.
406000	410000	I would say we miss one out of every eight shows or so just because, you know, sickness,
410000	412000	holiday, whatever else comes up.
412000	415000	But as far as pretty regularly weekly, we're the longest running.
415000	416000	We know that.
416000	421000	But there are other shows that maybe are twice a week, three times a week, or shows
421000	426000	that will do like a bunch of shows during E3 or PAX, like if they load up on interviews.
426000	429000	So, you know, it kind of depends on how you're counting.
429000	433000	So I would say there's a handful of gaming shows that have probably hit around 750 just
433000	436000	because they might do the multiple show thing, whether it's that they're multiple times a
436000	437000	week or what have you.
437000	442000	But regardless, I mean, we've been doing this for 750 weeks off and on.
442000	445000	So, I mean, what do you guys think?
445000	453000	Like, how do things look now for gaming as opposed to when we first started?
453000	457000	Like, did you ever kind of think we'd be doing some of the stuff now with games?
457000	460000	Did you ever think you'd be playing something like the games you're playing today, like
460000	465000	a DDR machine in your garage, Loki, when we first started our show way back on episode
465000	466000	one?
466000	469000	I didn't know if I'd...
469000	470000	Yeah, sure.
470000	474000	I thought I would have one by then.
474000	475000	Let's see.
475000	478000	Dark Sakura, did you ever think your pinball collection would be so big?
478000	479000	Kind of, yeah.
479000	483000	Because I mean, keep in mind, it wasn't too long after we started the show that Dan started
483000	485000	collecting the pinball.
485000	486000	I appreciate this here.
486000	490000	Tabiri in chat says, you guys don't look a day over 500 episodes.
490000	491000	That is so true.
491000	493000	It really is.
493000	496000	Kind of taking a look down memory lane for a minute here, because I always think this
496000	499000	is kind of fun to see, like, well, what were we talking about back in the day?
499000	503000	And thankfully, we have a wiki that kind of like helps us out and we can go way back.
503000	509000	Now, unfortunately, like some episodes are so old that they haven't been like chronicled
509000	510000	in the wiki yet.
510000	517000	But if I went back to say, if I went back to the to-go era, I think we did do an episode
517000	518000	50 in the to-go era.
518000	519000	Okay, here we go.
519000	526000	So episode 50 of our to-go podcast was on December 12th of 2005, and it covered the
526000	529000	Xbox 360 Japanese launch.
530000	535000	Well, how do you how do you guys all think that went?
535000	537000	Space poncherific.
537000	538000	Well, well, you know what?
538000	539000	They tried.
539000	543000	They tried to Japan, probably more so than they did with the one, because they were trying
543000	545000	to, you know, team up with certain key players.
545000	550000	That fact that they had Mistwalker with Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon was a thing, you know,
550000	552000	they kind of tried.
552000	557000	But I guess it just wasn't enough to really, you know, the Xbox 360 and Microsoft in general
557000	559000	just never really caught on in Japan.
559000	561000	I think it's like kind of more of a niche thing.
561000	562000	It still hasn't.
562000	563000	No, and it still hasn't.
563000	564000	You're right.
564000	565000	It really hasn't.
565000	566000	Let's see.
566000	569000	And yeah, Dartusuya says, those are the old shows.
569000	571000	I know many of the earlier episodes weren't archived.
571000	573000	I probably have MP3s of almost all of them.
573000	578000	I mean, there's there's some that are probably lost forever, but I have a good, good many
578000	579000	of them.
579000	580000	Let's see.
580000	582000	Going back to other nice big round numbers.
582000	588000	How about episode number 200 on September 17th of 2006?
588000	591000	We did Wii release date and price.
591000	595000	So that's when we finally heard the when the Wii was coming out.
595000	601000	Did you see that story this week, by the way, of the I guess they found a GameCube version
601000	603000	of the Wii controller.
603000	604000	Did you see that?
604000	608000	Like a prototype that so so when people were really developing for the Wii, it really was
608000	613000	a GameCube just duct taped to another GameCube in theory.
613000	615000	Let's see what else was on that episode.
615000	616000	DDR power previews.
616000	618000	I don't remember what that was.
618000	622000	And then we did like we did an extra long episode that night because 200 was a big deal.
622000	623000	Let's see.
623000	624000	Let's go back to 250.
624000	625000	I won't do every multiple 50.
625000	627000	We'll cut a wrap here.
627000	629000	Episode 250.
629000	631000	We not too big of a celebration.
631000	634000	The wiki notes.
634000	636000	But we hit the 250 episode mark.
636000	639000	Stories included Halo DS.
639000	641000	That was Halo DS was a thing.
641000	645000	Yeah, there was a fan like indie fan game.
645000	646000	I don't even remember that.
646000	648000	OK, it was an indie fan game.
648000	649000	OK, got it.
649000	650000	Well, actually, I don't know.
650000	652000	It may have been something they were considering of developing.
652000	658000	I remember I remember it vaguely, but like I don't remember if it was something like
658000	664000	Microsoft was thinking about publishing this on the DS because they didn't have a platform
664000	667000	that was portable or if it was like, well, I remember they did something.
667000	670000	Some of the Viva Pinata stuff ended up on DS.
670000	675000	So, yeah, so I think that may have been I remember there's like video of it and stuff.
675000	676000	I don't know.
676000	677000	Let's see.
677000	678000	And let's see.
678000	684000	Eight bit the movie and episode number 250 was also the debut of Dark Sakura's classic
684000	685000	game of the week.
685000	687000	Before that, we hadn't done that before.
687000	688000	You used to have other segments.
688000	690000	You had like what was it?
690000	691000	Website of the week.
691000	694000	And you had some advice column thing that you like.
694000	695000	Don't set yourself on fire.
695000	696000	I don't remember what it was.
696000	699000	It's like we should do an advice advice column again.
699000	701000	You want to bring that back?
701000	705000	Yeah, maybe I should do like a Dear Abby thing on our website.
705000	707000	It's called like Ask Dark Sakura.
707000	708000	There you go.
708000	711000	Now, that's good content to bring people to our website.
711000	712000	You should you should think about that.
712000	714000	Ask Dark Sakura some shit.
714000	715000	All right.
715000	716000	I love it.
716000	717000	Don't be an asshole.
717000	718000	Let's see.
718000	719000	Let's see.
719000	720000	I'll do one more hand in chat.
720000	721000	If you want me to do that.
721000	722000	I'll do one more.
722000	723000	Let's see.
723000	724000	Going.
724000	728640	Oh, you know, what's funny is it just if my screen froze for a minute on episode 285,
728640	730880	that was the Tommy Tallarico week.
730880	731880	That was when he came on.
731880	734280	I bring that up because we had the television news last week.
734280	735280	Forgot all about that.
735280	736280	Yeah.
736280	737280	Right.
737280	738280	And I sort of remember that.
738280	739280	But you don't remember when he came on the show.
739280	740960	I sort of remember that six hour long show.
740960	745920	You think the show is long usually that episode went all night.
745920	746920	That man can talk.
746920	747920	He can.
747920	748920	He's great.
748920	749920	He's just he loves what he does.
749920	750920	What can you say?
750920	751920	It's not a bad thing.
751920	752920	Bring him on again.
752920	755840	I will definitely send him an email as an invite, although it'll probably be better
755840	759760	to get a little closer to when, you know, the Amico has a little more show.
759760	760760	Sorry.
760760	765080	When the show's over, Amico be out.
765080	766080	Let's see.
766080	769720	My my screen is freezing up over here, but let me see if I get because I'm on this ancient
769720	774680	computer, which by the powers of Windows XP, I should say this, too.
774680	778180	We're not going to be able to use Skype on this machine after next week.
778180	783460	So tonight may be the last night you can use Skype to call into the show.
783460	784460	I don't know yet.
784460	785460	Or at least for a little bit.
785460	787280	We have to just take a break from Skype.
787280	791720	We have to see some other people for a little bit until we get the new computer and all
791720	793480	that set up for the new studio.
793480	794480	We'll see.
794480	795480	All right.
795480	802620	On the 500th episode of O.L.R., our Wiki says some features, some features of the original
802620	805540	Wii are going offline.
805540	808840	So episode 250 was the Wii is coming out.
808840	813020	Episode 500 was the Wii is going offline.
813020	815940	I don't know why that's so funny, but it is.
815940	820940	And then Tomb Raider got a Japanese language pack for $30.
820940	824740	So you could you could play the game in Japanese for a price.
824740	827940	And I think that was a pretty big controversy that was going on at the time.
827940	830180	And we did match game on episode 500.
830180	832740	We haven't played one of our little games in quite some time.
832740	833980	We used to be really known for those.
833980	834980	We just kind of.
834980	838320	I mean, without dark soccer being here regularly, we haven't really been able to do listless
838320	839320	as much.
839320	842900	And, you know, we used to do more of those games when our studio would really be full
842900	846100	of people, because in the early days of O.L.R., especially like those years that you and I
846100	849340	lived in that apartment, like I felt like we had like seven people on the show every
849340	850340	week.
850340	851340	It was nuts.
851340	852340	So, yeah.
852340	855860	So the games that Webcam with the one frame every ten seconds.
855860	856860	Yeah.
856860	857860	Now we're talking about moving back to Twitch.
857860	861820	Y'all, for a while, you used to go you used to go to our Web site or it's not really a
861820	862820	com.
862820	869700	And we had a Webcam picture that would refresh once every like 15 seconds.
869700	870700	Powers of the Internet.
870700	871700	I know.
871700	872700	Right.
872700	874300	And now it's like, well, we're going back to it.
874300	875300	What?
875300	877260	The stream is only 30 frames per second.
877260	879780	That's just terrible.
879780	880780	I love it.
880780	881780	All right.
881780	886580	Anyhow, let's get into some kickoff topics for tonight.
886580	889820	Let's talk about Nintendo Labo in schools.
889820	895920	So Nintendo Labo is apparently going to be a part of some curriculums.
895920	900260	They're saying Labo is going to be integrated in 100 U.S. classrooms throughout the current
900260	901260	school year.
901260	907100	This according to a Nintendo announcement with the nonprofit Institute of Play.
907100	911800	Students in grades two through four are going to be able to build Labo projects focusing
911800	917360	on the basic concept of STEAM, communication, creativity, critical thinking and problem
917360	918640	solving.
918640	920120	You can apply to join the program.
920120	923200	If you happen to be a teacher, I know we actually have gamer teachers listen to the show.
923200	926680	You go to the Institute of Play's Web site and you can be a part of this program.
926680	930160	If you're selected, you get guidance from Nintendo and the Institute, a companion teacher
930160	935040	guide that has a whole curriculum in it and the whole other like I guess the actual guide
935040	937840	will be made available to free for anyone later in the year.
937840	938840	So that's kind of cool.
938840	943240	The Institute of Play does want to do a diverse group of schools around the U.S. urban, suburban,
943240	945540	rural areas and so forth.
945540	949400	So what do you guys think about Labo being used in the classroom?
949400	953840	You know, I remember when Nintendo first announced Labo, it was kind of like, it kind of got
953840	956480	some mixed reaction, I think, from the gamer fans.
956480	960120	But I think there were definitely those of us that looked at that and said, well, it's
960120	962840	not really meant to be a game.
962840	967340	This is Nintendo's way to kind of find another niche in the toy market.
967340	969920	This is kind of like the reverse of toys to games.
969920	971380	It's games to toys.
971380	972380	It's neat.
972380	977580	It's like it reminds me of like those Lego, the robotic sets that they have, you know,
977580	982820	where they do a lot of I've seen like different classes through, you know, could be schools
982820	987220	or could be just like the most random one I've seen is they have this place called Bounce
987220	991540	You, which is like one of those bounce house places that you go and jump on bounce houses
991540	993620	for like an hour.
993620	998420	But then they also do like this, like robotics camp or like night out thing where it's like
998420	1003180	you can drop your kids off and they build robots for using the Lego Mindstorm stuff.
1003180	1006820	It's kind of like that, except it's Labo.
1006820	1007820	And I don't know.
1007820	1014660	I mean, granted, the software is pretty good, but I don't know how easy it is to create
1014660	1018340	these new things versus like putting bricks together.
1018340	1019340	Yeah.
1019340	1020340	Yeah.
1020340	1026660	So you've got a young kid, but like your kid is not quite at the age where they're doing
1026660	1030620	this type of like educational gaming in the classroom yet, right?
1030620	1031620	He plays.
1031620	1032620	He has his own.
1032620	1037060	Well, usually he would have his own Chromebook in the class.
1037060	1038060	Oh, wow.
1038060	1040900	So they do like something on that.
1040900	1046520	I don't know what he does exactly on that, but like they do like typing and they earn
1046520	1052000	credits doing things on there to play like educational games, I guess.
1052000	1053000	Like so long.
1053000	1061040	So they can like he tends to save all of his credits, like play an hour of games at a time.
1061040	1063040	OK, that's I guess that's good.
1063040	1064600	He's learning investment early on.
1064600	1065600	That's good.
1065600	1066600	That's a good thing.
1066600	1068440	So they have like Chromebooks and stuff in classes.
1068440	1069440	OK.
1069440	1073400	Because I just I remember, you know, back in my day when I was a kid, it was all about,
1073400	1076040	you know, when we were in what, like the fourth grade?
1076080	1077600	I think it wasn't until like the fourth grade.
1077600	1084160	I remember going to the computer lab to play the Oregon Trail and number munchers.
1084160	1086160	And I remember taking like a logo.
1086160	1087480	I remember taking a nighttime class.
1087480	1090520	It was about logo and that stuff was like an enrichment thing.
1090520	1094440	I remember my dad went with me to something like that was like a turtle.
1094440	1095440	Yeah.
1095440	1096440	Logo was the turtle.
1096440	1097440	It's like learning how to program.
1097440	1100640	And so that way you think about flow charts and design and things like that.
1100640	1103920	It's actually I don't think we ever got that far as more of like, OK, put these commands
1103920	1104920	in.
1104920	1105920	And what do you get?
1105920	1111120	You know, it's like, OK, I go to our chat over at live dot vog network dot com.
1111120	1112120	Let's see.
1112120	1116200	Guys, you don't chat says the only way Labo is a good idea is if they give it to the school
1116200	1117880	without making the teachers buy it.
1117880	1122720	Well, I would assume if Nintendo is in on this, it's not something you have to buy it.
1122720	1124880	I'm curious to see what it is like.
1124880	1128200	The idea doesn't sound terrible, but it's just.
1128200	1133800	I don't know, like if if it's just a software like some specific kits like, OK, here you
1133800	1135200	can make this thing out of it.
1135200	1136200	That's fine.
1136200	1137400	That's kind of you can be creative and stuff with.
1137400	1143360	But at the same time, like I think like it would be more intuitive, like for like Arduino
1143360	1148860	or something like that, like, for example, someone we know, Mr. Punk Knight, you know,
1148860	1155540	he is a teacher in middle school and he teaches computer science and stuff.
1155540	1161120	And so he actually does like Arduino and robotics and 3D printing stuff in his class.
1161120	1162120	Wow.
1163120	1171560	You know, like that, if that was in like an elective when I was back in junior high, I
1171560	1172560	would have taken that shit.
1172560	1177440	I took the best I could do was American Technologies, which was like an engineering class and mechanical
1177440	1179720	drawing, which, you know, is like drafting.
1179720	1184080	So we didn't have any sort of my elective, like all throughout high school was banned,
1184080	1185640	which I mean, I don't regret.
1185640	1186640	Yeah.
1186640	1190520	You're a fellow band geek to Bobby Blackwell's, a fellow band geek, like, you know, us band
1190520	1191800	geeks turned out OK.
1191800	1197600	And I think still kind of have a lot of a lot of overlap with gaming and all that stuff.
1197600	1201360	Remember, it ain't a party until the contract contract to a clarinet player shows up.
1201360	1205480	Well, I mean, there's a reason that there was that running joke in that movie American
1205480	1212440	Pie where at this one time at band camp, because it's all true, you know, nerds were freaks.
1212440	1215880	We didn't have like a camp that you went to like that.
1215880	1220080	We had a swamp in the backfield at school that we would just march in.
1220080	1221080	Oh, we had band camp.
1221080	1224040	But it wasn't like it wasn't like you went away for three days.
1224040	1225040	It was band camp.
1225040	1229640	Well, my quote fingers was that three days, like a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday before
1229640	1233340	the school semester started, you only three days.
1233340	1235280	I think it was only three days or two weeks.
1235280	1236280	Wow.
1236280	1239720	That's well, we did the three days and then we also did like one night a week through
1239720	1242640	the rest of the year, like an extra like field practices.
1242640	1246900	That's how we learned the field shows, basically, you know, which the field show and band is
1246900	1249200	when they do all those little patterns out on the football field.
1249200	1250200	You guys have all seen that before.
1250320	1251680	Yeah, no, we did.
1251680	1253320	We did two weeks.
1253320	1258200	There was like marching fundamentals and then we would learn the show and memorize a lot
1258200	1263880	of our music, which I mean, it's well, this show did start as a music gaming show.
1263880	1268100	And I think like music games in some ways, I don't want to say it was really like the
1268100	1271640	gateway that got me into games because I was playing games before music games like still
1271640	1274120	waiting for sex maniacs.
1274120	1276920	Music games really made me love video games in a whole nother way.
1276920	1278640	I don't know if that makes sense.
1279080	1284040	Kind of made me finally make sitar hero and actually there wasn't like a real game.
1284040	1288480	It was a flash game on the love guru website for that terrible movie.
1288480	1289600	I know, but it was still funny.
1289600	1290720	Yeah, sitar hero.
1290720	1291240	Exactly.
1291240	1292240	How long do we joke about it?
1294040	1298680	So, I mean, what would you guys like to what do you guys think gaming could do?
1298680	1301160	And I open this up to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1301160	1306120	It doesn't just have to be Labo, but what types of games do you think could help people
1306120	1306640	learn?
1306760	1312120	What do you think are some good like learning types of games that kids could be playing?
1312120	1315920	You know, when I was in junior high school, we used to just kind of on our lunch, we used
1315920	1318720	to play, um, scorched earth.
1318720	1320200	I was thinking the same thing.
1320200	1321200	Yes.
1321200	1322200	Right.
1322200	1323200	Do you remember that scorcher?
1323200	1325560	And that's when you would learn about angles and velocity.
1325560	1327640	So everybody's played a game like scorched earth.
1327640	1331080	I'm sure like years ago there was another, it was a tank wars was the other big one that
1331080	1335760	used to, which is basically all of these games, worms, like, right.
1335760	1340360	Worms is kind of like, but worms now you could like move the worms and you wouldn't really
1340360	1341360	do that.
1341360	1342360	And scorched earth.
1342360	1343360	I guess that's right.
1343360	1345160	You get like little developments for the tanks and you can move them.
1345160	1346160	Right.
1346160	1350360	So anyway, those like scorched earth was all about being able to like shoot the nuke over
1350360	1353720	the hill and you got to get the right velocity and angle.
1353720	1354720	And it was actually kind of fun.
1354720	1355720	Like, I don't know.
1355720	1359520	Like, I feel like we learned a lot playing that game, but like our science teacher used
1359520	1362920	to love to let us come in and use the computers to play scorched earth on lunch.
1362920	1363920	He thought it was hilarious.
1363920	1364920	So, yeah.
1364920	1365920	Yeah.
1365920	1368800	I mean, I don't know what they could play.
1368800	1373320	I mean, I know that Minecraft has its own, like they have a whole programming thing that
1373320	1377880	you can do with Minecraft as well, cause they're all redstone stuff.
1377880	1382560	So they actually have like a coding Minecraft thing.
1382560	1383560	I mean, I don't know.
1383560	1388880	I think like there could be other tools that they could make that be able to do like something
1389200	1393640	I don't really know what we're trying to teach our children is what I'm thinking.
1393640	1396360	You know, a lot of it's just like, depends on the age.
1396360	1402120	Like right now, you know, it's more of like typing skills, you know, maybe like a second
1402120	1403120	language.
1403120	1406960	Do they teach your kids how to write as much as they teach them how to type?
1406960	1409640	They teach them how to write more than typing.
1409640	1414600	Typing's more of like, here, here's your login to this, you know, typing site.
1414600	1417440	Cause I would swear that cursive is going to become a lost art.
1417440	1420400	I would like being able to write cursive, like that seems like the type of thing that
1420400	1423680	like in like 30 years, I don't know.
1423680	1426840	Maybe I'm, maybe I'm just being crazy, but like, is it just me, but it seemed like cursive
1426840	1427840	is one of those things.
1427840	1429240	How often do you write in cursive?
1429240	1431000	When I sign my name.
1431000	1432000	Yeah.
1432000	1433000	When I sign my name, that's it.
1433000	1434420	When I sign my name, I write in cursive.
1434420	1435880	Do you ever write in cursive, Darksira?
1435880	1436880	All the time actually.
1436880	1438200	Of course she does.
1438200	1439200	Of course.
1439200	1440200	Of course she does.
1440200	1441200	It's always Jamie when there's something.
1441200	1445680	I was writing cursive before it was popular.
1445700	1447800	She used her hammer and chisel to do it.
1447800	1453560	Well, no, but I'm also going back and trying to learn proper calligraphy because I mean,
1453560	1457040	to me it's, it is kind of an art form.
1457040	1458660	I could see it as like an art.
1458660	1461520	If you have an artistic interest in absolutely like cursive and calligraphy.
1461520	1465260	I'm not trying to like slam cursive, but I'm just saying like in the real world, how often
1465260	1466920	do you use cursive outside of signing your name?
1466920	1467920	Because now it's typing.
1467920	1469180	You got to know how to type.
1469180	1470180	You have to know how to type.
1470180	1474640	Well, when I, when I hand take notes, it's actually kind of funny because sometimes I
1474640	1480680	will switch in between using cursive and script in the middle of my notes or writing
1480680	1485860	letters or I'll combine the letters cause they're easier to hand write in cursive than
1485860	1489760	they are in print, especially after, you know, having three hand surgeries.
1489760	1494840	Although I also will sometimes find that I've started writing my notes backwards.
1494840	1499120	I mean complete backwards mirror image cause I can do that and it happens sometimes.
1499120	1500120	Okay.
1500120	1501680	Hey word.
1502000	1507480	Bob coffee and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says educational games should also teach critical
1507480	1511000	thinking because a lot of today's kids are fucking morons.
1511000	1515760	Well, that seems to be a very broad stroke, but yes, they do need to teach critical thinking.
1515760	1519380	I mean, I was just thinking the other day about like, are we teaching our kids in schools
1519380	1524120	how to spot fake shit on social media and how to like, like, like seriously, like I
1524120	1527160	don't mean to get all like political, but like I would think in this day and age you
1527160	1531280	want to teach people at a young age how to spot fake shit online because there's a lot
1531280	1532280	of it.
1532280	1537000	I think that they should go back instead of making like debate part of, you know, like
1537000	1540800	an extracurricular thing or making it part of like a particular class.
1540800	1542560	They should teach rhetoric.
1542560	1549000	Now, the communication class that I was in was like a group debate class in college,
1549000	1555940	but he, my, my, uh, my professors actually had his masters in rhetoric and part of what
1555940	1560640	rhetoric teaches is how to decide what is a fallacious argument.
1560640	1566800	You know, how to point out when you're heading into a fallacy like slippery slope argument,
1566800	1571100	straw man arguments, you know, let me, let me steer us back on course a little bit because
1571100	1573480	even though this is a good conversation, it is games.
1573480	1575280	Something that should be taught.
1575280	1577720	Is there a way we could use games to do that?
1577720	1578800	There could be games for that.
1578800	1580640	There could be, you know, spot the fallacy.
1580640	1585900	I mean, I would play a game like that because I do that all the time anyway on Facebook.
1585900	1586900	You do it for free.
1586900	1587900	I do it for free.
1587900	1588900	Why not make a game out of it?
1588900	1591240	That's like a high score for pointing out idiocy.
1591240	1598940	I remember playing a game on my Commodore 64 that was about running for president and
1598940	1602980	the things you had to do in different states to get electoral votes.
1602980	1606140	And it taught you like by playing this game, it taught you about like how the electoral
1606140	1607380	college worked and all that.
1607380	1611360	And look, I know that's a controversial thing, but it's the, it's the way it is.
1611360	1612400	So you should learn about it.
1612400	1615700	You should learn how your government works, whether you agree with it or not, right?
1615700	1618460	So like this game on the Commodore, like taught me about all that.
1618460	1621500	And I think, you know, those, those are the types of things that I think are really cool
1621500	1626020	when a game sort of helps you, like a video game helps you learn some of these more like
1626020	1631620	complex things like, like in history and all that, um, especially, uh, where in the world
1631620	1632620	is Carmen Sandiego?
1632620	1635780	Well, especially the further down the road you went with those games was great.
1635780	1636780	Yeah.
1636780	1638640	Where in time you started to really learn historical things.
1638640	1642980	Same thing with, um, where in, uh, I think there was where in the USA, where in the world
1642980	1646100	and there was another one, I don't remember what it was like.
1646100	1651020	I felt like the more they went, the more, I guess it was, there was more you would actually
1651020	1654860	learn about like history and the earth, but now it's kind of hard to go back and play
1654860	1659940	this because I actually tried like to pick up, you know, where in the world and it was
1659940	1664260	because our geography has changed so much and you know, some of those countries don't
1664260	1666260	even exist anymore.
1666260	1670300	It's something that you absolutely update and keep that series fresh.
1670300	1672300	Our chat rooms lighting up with some great comments.
1672300	1674940	I can't read these all, but you guys are having a good discussion in there.
1674940	1675940	Thank you.
1675980	1679660	And looking at chat at live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwell started off mentioning the
1679660	1684180	Assassin's Creed origins had the educational version where you'd learn about Egyptian mythology.
1684180	1686980	That was kind of a recent thing and I thought that was, Oh yeah, that was kind of like a
1686980	1688740	neat little side thing you could do.
1688740	1694060	I did actually bring this up when Assassin's Creed two was out that my art history teacher
1694060	1700460	used screenshots from Assassin's Creed two to talk about Renaissance Italy because it
1700460	1706300	actually had a very, as she put it, a very accurate layout of what, uh, you know, the
1706300	1709780	Vatican was supposed to be like then or however it was and where all these buildings were
1709780	1710780	laid out.
1710780	1711780	Right.
1711780	1712780	Yeah.
1712780	1715260	I would imagine Assassin's Creed has a lot of value in teaching art history, you know,
1715260	1718500	because when the designers make this game, they immerse themselves in it.
1718500	1720780	They have to teach themselves about all of this.
1720780	1725680	So I just remember reading about how, um, for whatever this last one that came out was
1725680	1730960	where they were actually having to go in and study like Spartan and Greek, uh, Odyssey
1730960	1736280	the Greek Odyssey is the Greek one, the, um, lifestyles so that they could accurately do
1736280	1737280	costumes.
1737280	1741600	Now, some of them they had to tweak, you know, to make them work, but where they were going
1741600	1745880	in and trying to make them as historically accurate as they could possibly be.
1745880	1747960	And they were consulting with historians.
1747960	1750200	And I think that we need more of that.
1750200	1754020	I want to read one more comment in chat because I think this is important and then we'll go
1754020	1757220	on to another kickoff topic we have, cause this was supposed to be a short one, but it's
1757220	1758220	a good discussion.
1758220	1762000	Uh, SG100 Matt says, my girlfriend is a school teacher and her feeling is that it's hard
1762000	1765600	to make a game for kids that will get them engaged in it.
1765600	1768980	Part of the reason is that kids are smart and know when they're trying to be catered
1768980	1770180	to.
1770180	1773700	Games that are overly educational seem lame to a lot of kids.
1773700	1778260	It's all about hitting those things that kids like about games and helping them to retain
1778260	1780700	the knowledge they learn from a game.
1780700	1782480	How I, and that brings up a good point.
1782480	1785660	How do you make educational games not lame?
1785660	1790240	What was it about things like number munchers and Oregon Trail from our era?
1790240	1793520	What made those games cool to play that didn't feel lame?
1793520	1794520	I'll say this.
1794520	1799160	I think in Oregon Trail, what made that game like not lame was that you had that whole
1799160	1800360	little side thing.
1800360	1803520	Well, not only cause your friends die of dysentery, that was huge, right?
1803520	1805760	You would put in like your friends and your frenemies.
1805760	1810480	So like you put in like dark Sakura and then like somewhere along the line, like dark Sakura,
1810480	1814040	you know, and you try to Ford the river and dark Sakura drowns and you laugh cause your
1814040	1815040	friend drowned.
1815040	1816040	Even though it's kind of morbid.
1816040	1817040	Sorry, dark Sakura.
1817040	1818960	But she's done it to me, I'm sure.
1818960	1823700	So anyway, but there's also those sequences where like you would go hunting for the Buffalo.
1823700	1825760	And so that was like the arcade part of the games.
1825760	1830480	It was like they made a little like, like arcade ish, which, you know, not that the
1830480	1834280	shooting game was that complicated, but it was reminiscent of Atari.
1834280	1837380	Number munchers was kind of like that number of munchers really felt like you were playing
1837380	1838380	an arcade game.
1838380	1839380	Yeah.
1839380	1843840	It was like the arcade and back then, yeah, the quality was like, this is basically just
1843840	1847360	a game, but you know, it's education based type.
1847360	1850920	And so maybe, you know, kind of piggybacking on what dark Sakura said a minute ago about,
1850920	1853280	you know, the assassin's creed and all that.
1853280	1856520	And somebody in chat brought up the fact that there's actually historical notes that you
1856520	1858600	can look at as you're playing assassin's creed.
1858600	1864160	Maybe that's one way to do it is to kind of put a little more education in the games that
1864160	1865160	we already enjoy.
1865160	1867160	I don't know.
1867940	1871340	I, I really want to see more things like that happen.
1871340	1876340	And on top of that too, now, and there's people who are going to argue against this, but I'd
1876340	1883860	like to see a lot more social commentary in games as in, you know, illustrate what terrible
1883860	1890580	things happened in the past, you know, basic game around, you know, tragic events, you
1890580	1895500	know, not necessarily to make light of those events, but to bring light to those events.
1895840	1899520	Because, I mean, you've got a lot of people who are now trying to deny certain things
1899520	1904680	in history happened and doing revisionist history, when the phrase still stands, those
1904680	1906600	who forget history are doomed to repeat it.
1906600	1908800	Hello world right now.
1908800	1913360	You know, I think that we really should have a lot more historical commentary in light
1913360	1914600	of what goes on today.
1914600	1915600	You know what?
1915600	1919200	That's one thing I always really liked about Gamer X, you know, the years that that was
1919200	1920200	around.
1920220	1926820	It wasn't just necessarily like LGBTQ plus type games, but I felt like there were a lot
1926820	1929340	of games that had something to say with social commentary with them.
1929340	1934100	I feel like that era, like when we were attending, you know, that show, we saw a lot of games
1934100	1937940	that were coming out that were not just, you know, games from a perspective, like the,
1937940	1941700	the fragments of him or something, which allows you to experience, you know, a story, you
1941700	1944900	know, from a different perspective that might not be yours.
1944900	1948140	But I remember playing this game that was like a puzzle game and it was about trying
1948160	1954560	to arrange three people sleeping on a bed because it was kind of a social commentary.
1954560	1958080	And I'm not saying it's a social, you have to agree with it or you don't agree with it.
1958080	1961840	It's a reflection of a social commentary on triad relationships.
1961840	1966240	You know, whether you get it or not, this is some people's lives, right?
1966240	1967240	Absolutely.
1967240	1972040	Um, you know, and things like, and I know, I know this game carries a lot of other weight
1972040	1976920	out there, but if you look at the game isolated by itself, a game like Depression Quest, why
1976920	1981300	did that game have the social impact that it did?
1981300	1985800	And ultimately this whole other, whoo, they came up as a result, right?
1985800	1990100	But I mean, if you go back to just the game itself, which was a text adventure game, it
1990100	1995880	was a social commentary on this thing that not everybody is necessarily experienced.
1995880	1999460	And it was a way for you to kind of like put yourself in the shoes.
1999460	2003920	And I think a lot of our problems in the world would be solved if we could just walk in somebody
2003920	2005540	else's shoes for a little bit.
2006440	2007440	Not all of them.
2007440	2012760	Basic empathy is something that a lot of people lack and it's not encouraged for people to
2012760	2014400	have on top of that.
2014400	2019920	If we had a little bit more focus on being able to relate and being empathetic to other
2019920	2025660	people, I'm positive we wouldn't have, well, actually I'm even going to go another layer
2025660	2026660	beyond that.
2026660	2031960	If history were accurately taught, you know, I was lucky enough that I had teachers who
2031960	2035500	would say, okay, this in your history book, it's wrong, here's what happened.
2035500	2041240	If you had more people who were willing to step away from a curriculum and actually teach
2041240	2044520	real things, yes, this is what really happened.
2044520	2048780	Yeah, your book says this, but really these people came in and killed all these people
2048780	2049780	or this happened.
2049780	2054280	It wasn't just, you know, friendly handshake and everyone was, you know, suddenly pals,
2054280	2055280	you know.
2055280	2060680	I think that those things need to be taught younger and younger and then teach about,
2060680	2065660	you know, where empathy comes in, the good that comes from being a compassionate human
2065660	2071300	being so that it can hopefully, well, and on top of that to teach proper sexual education
2071300	2076360	so that we don't have a bunch of asshole rapists who don't know where babies come from.
2076360	2081040	You know, it's, it's just this cult of stupidity that people are fostering.
2081040	2087200	And I honestly think that our video games could play such a role in combating that.
2087200	2089940	Really make them, make them fun, but put the lesson in.
2089940	2093860	If you've got to be sneaky about it, fucking be sneaky, but put it in there.
2093860	2094860	All right.
2094860	2098180	A good note to end on with that topic, but we can probably spend three hours talking
2098180	2101060	about this topic alone, but great discussion and thanks everybody in our chat.
2101060	2103900	I have another kickoff topic before we get to our gaming week because there's two things
2103900	2104900	I wanted to bring.
2104900	2105900	I thought that would be a short one.
2105900	2107620	I didn't think we'd have a lot to say, but who knew?
2107620	2111820	I want to also talk about TwitchCon because TwitchCon happened this past weekend.
2111820	2115460	I'm really heartbroken I couldn't go because it was just two hours away, but there was
2115460	2119900	so much going on this weekend that was just, it was quite frankly, with all due respect,
2119900	2122060	more important than TwitchCon.
2122060	2127460	For example, yesterday was Captain Spike from gameboo.org got married.
2127460	2133640	So congratulations and all that to him and his new husband and wish them all the best.
2133640	2139060	But also I hosted Rocky Horror last night, which is why my voice is a little bit eh today,
2139060	2141160	because there was all that going on.
2141160	2144020	So unfortunately I couldn't get to TwitchCon just because I had these other things going
2144020	2148180	on, but I was certainly watching from home and I was looking at all the pictures and
2148180	2152340	experiencing big time missing out syndrome, but it happens.
2152340	2155200	But then I also was listening about some of the announcements.
2155200	2159020	And I know as somebody who has done some streaming on Twitch and hopes to do more with this show
2159020	2162820	on Twitch in the future, I was very curious what they had to say with some of the announcements.
2162820	2165540	One of the biggest announcements they made at the Twitch keynote was that there will
2165540	2168220	be a squad stream feature.
2168220	2173420	In a nutshell, it's Mixer's co-stream feature finally making its way over to Twitch.
2173420	2175020	The Minute Mixer unleashed that.
2175020	2178580	We were kind of wondering how long before Twitch does something like that.
2178580	2179580	Here we are.
2179580	2184820	So you'll be able to stream with up to four people in a single view, which when you go
2184820	2188100	to any of the channels, you will see basically the quad view.
2188100	2190820	The chat is all linked, which I think is pretty cool.
2190820	2191820	Oh no, I'm sorry.
2191820	2193820	Chat is linked to whatever channel is your main view.
2193820	2198640	So you can kind of go to, you know, camera one, camera two, whatever you want to do.
2198640	2199640	Select streamers.
2199640	2201500	They say, well, we get to test this out later this year.
2201500	2203100	They're doing changes to the highlight editor.
2203420	2207580	So you could do like multiple moments in one highlight as opposed to just like everything
2207580	2208780	having to happen all in a row.
2208780	2211100	It just sounds like you kind of like string your clips together.
2211100	2213700	It just kind of sounds like an improvement there.
2213700	2217020	This sounds really exciting for discoverability for those of us that are a little more up
2217020	2218020	and coming.
2218020	2224940	The Twitch homepage plans to feature new partners and affiliates, streamers local to the viewer,
2224940	2230100	which is kind of interesting, up and coming streamers, which again was something Mixer
2230100	2232500	did that I always kind of liked.
2232500	2237340	Understanding how this competition is now kind of causing some developments.
2237340	2239300	That's kind of cool.
2239300	2242780	And then they're also talking about VIP badges is going to be something new so you can actually
2242780	2245480	make somebody a VIP member of your community.
2245480	2249700	So like if somebody maybe doesn't have the dollars to be able to subscribe, you can make
2249700	2254060	them, depending on how much you stream, you can make so many VIP members and they get
2254060	2255060	a special acknowledgement.
2255060	2257260	They get a special badge just for being there.
2257260	2260760	It's like a, you know, a VIP, somebody that is always there and supporting you.
2260760	2264240	And I know there's a few people I would definitely like want to give this to.
2264240	2265760	Some good moderator tools.
2265760	2269480	This is more for the big channels that are consistently having to timeout, kick, ban
2269480	2270480	people.
2270480	2271480	This will allow them to keep that.
2271480	2273120	Like it's basically like we can keep notes.
2273120	2277520	So like, you know, let's say, you know, we can make a note on Bobby Black Wolf's file
2277520	2282680	that like he was starting an argument about Chrono Trigger versus Super Metroid.
2282680	2284760	And I had to give him a timeout for five minutes.
2284760	2287120	I can make a note in the file there.
2287120	2290720	So that way, like going in your permanent record, I'm putting this in your record,
2290720	2291680	Bobby.
2291680	2294760	And then that way, if somebody saw that later on, like, oh, he's doing it again.
2294760	2297680	That's strike two, you know, or whatever we could, we could make notes on that.
2297680	2301760	So I don't even have IRC open at the moment as I'm reading.
2301760	2306640	I don't even want to see what Bobby's screaming in chat in response to that.
2306640	2307640	Let's see.
2307640	2312040	Uh, also for subscribers, you get to see exactly how long, uh, without it necessarily being
2312040	2313240	consecutive months.
2313240	2317120	And then I think the other big thing is with extensions, they're partnering with Snapchat
2317120	2318120	and the snap camera.
2318640	2323120	So you can do Snapchat filters on your Twitch stream, which sounds a little silly.
2323120	2327720	Like I have no need for those types of things, but I guess if maybe you're more of a social
2327720	2333520	ask me anything fun channel or whatever, then maybe you have a little more use for these.
2333520	2338260	But I think it's a little bit silly myself, but Loki, would you use some Snapchat filters
2338260	2339520	as you play DDR?
2339520	2340760	I don't think that would work well.
2340760	2343800	Make yourself a little puppy dog face as you're dancing.
2343800	2347800	I think that would be all sorts of broken, but yeah, sure.
2347800	2351960	One last thing, uh, the bounty board is going to be expanding.
2351960	2356800	So certain affiliates and partners get to use the bounty board to earn more money.
2356800	2361140	And I think this really, it really sounds like game companies that are willing to give
2361140	2365880	you like a copy of the game and even maybe some kit back, some ad dollars basically for
2365880	2368920	playing the game, not being negative on it.
2368920	2373920	Like the, the little screenshot example that they show says Assassin's Creed Odyssey brought
2373960	2378800	to you by Ubisoft game key included with bounty activation.
2378800	2382440	And then basically, uh, you have to stream it for an hour straight with an average of
2382440	2383820	a certain amount of viewers.
2383820	2386720	If you don't hit the average, you get a proportional percentage of the payout.
2386720	2388260	So that's kind of interesting.
2388260	2391420	It says no needless bad mouthing of the content.
2391420	2394000	Be sure to engage with the content in your community.
2394000	2398700	And then you have a bounties widget and you have to turn on the past broadcasts and so
2398700	2399700	on and so on.
2399700	2403440	So like they're not telling you what to say, but they, you know, it makes sense if the
2403440	2407760	company's going to be sponsoring you, you can't just sit there and bag on what a terrible
2407760	2412960	game and necessarily, yeah, it has to be criticism with purpose basically, but I would think
2412960	2417960	if you're doing one of these, you do have a responsibility to disclose, Hey guys, uh,
2417960	2421840	we're checking out a bounty provided to us by Assassin's Creed and Ubisoft today.
2421840	2423960	So I wanted to check this game out with y'all.
2423960	2424960	Let's take a look.
2424960	2429520	You know, you want to disclose, it's an ad basically hashtag ad, right?
2429520	2430520	I do it.
2430520	2431520	Yeah.
2431520	2432520	I think that sounds kind of exciting.
2432600	2438760	It'll be, it'll be interesting to see, um, uh, what levels they kind of let people participate
2438760	2439760	that with.
2439760	2443960	So, um, Bobby Black Wolf in chat is actually mentioning on a serious note.
2443960	2447200	I mean, he's, he's poking fun at the chrono trigger thing, but on a serious note says
2447200	2451160	I had total FOMO fear of missing out on not going to TwitchCon.
2451160	2455360	When do we squad stream Forza Horizon 4, uh, day one that it's out.
2455360	2460160	The only problem is you're going to be competing with Delvin and I streaming Mario Kart 8.
2460160	2462400	So that's going to be a big week.
2463280	2464280	Yeah.
2464280	2465280	That'd be five.
2465280	2466280	I'm just gonna make it a point to stream.
2466280	2467280	Nothing new.
2467280	2469080	Well, there's nothing wrong with playing retro titles.
2469080	2470080	It's old.
2470080	2471080	Why not?
2471080	2472280	I want like, not like old, old.
2472280	2475200	I want like PS one era.
2475200	2476200	Go for it.
2476200	2478000	I think there's people that will watch it.
2478000	2481720	I have been thinking about switching up to fourth plus on my machine and I was like,
2481720	2484160	you know, once I do that, I've got invite Rob over.
2484160	2485160	Yeah.
2485160	2486160	Heck yeah.
2486160	2487160	Heck yeah.
2487160	2488160	I want to play some fourth plus.
2488160	2489160	Yeah.
2489160	2490160	We need to do it.
2490160	2491160	We may.
2491160	2492160	We need to do like an OLR midweek stream.
2492920	2493920	I want to do like, I'm so disappointed.
2493920	2498040	Like, cause I always have to carry the brunt of the kids, but next week they're doing the
2498040	2501920	whole extra life stuff on Saturday.
2501920	2505760	So I was like, man, it'd be awesome to be able to just like play DDR all day and stream
2505760	2506760	it.
2506760	2508920	But that's a lot of DDR.
2508920	2512680	Well, I wouldn't be doing like doubles non-stops constantly.
2512680	2514960	I mean, that's the thing.
2514960	2515960	Yeah.
2515960	2517600	Well, um, let's figure that out.
2517600	2520440	I mean, this week might be a little crazy cause of Halloween, but maybe in two weeks,
2520440	2525320	why don't I come over and we'll do, um, like a strong, I'll come guest on your stream or
2525320	2526320	something.
2526320	2527320	Sure.
2527320	2528320	And you get me a fourth mix plus.
2528320	2532040	Oh, I have, I have the image in the seat, the drive, I just have to install it.
2532040	2533040	All right.
2533040	2534040	We'll make that happen.
2534040	2535720	So anyway, exciting things happening with Twitch.
2535720	2539040	Thanks to TwitchCon and hope everybody that went had a great time.
2539040	2541880	I know Jason who does all the voiceovers here.
2541880	2546560	If you noticed tonight, tonight's voiceover was very good, but he, you'll notice he kind
2546560	2547920	of didn't address the news.
2547920	2552020	He just said, hooray, they made it cause he did that in advance cause he's at TwitchCon.
2552020	2553800	So he knew he'd be there this weekend.
2553800	2555440	So he kind of gave us something we could use tonight.
2555440	2558840	It's a little, little more generic and not targeted at the news this week since he wouldn't
2558840	2560360	know what was going to come up in the news.
2560360	2562960	So, uh, I know Jason's there and having a good time.
2562960	2565520	So maybe we'll hear from him a little more about what it was like on the ground.
2565520	2571040	And I know some streamers that I, I watch, um, and interact with went, so, um, hopefully
2571040	2572400	we'll get to go next year.
2572400	2573760	Uh, just wasn't in the cards this year.
2573760	2576240	I really, please don't pick Halloween weekend next year.
2576240	2579240	You guys, please don't pick Halloween weekend.
2579240	2582600	And it's, you know what else is terrible about Halloween weekend?
2582600	2585000	Next week is BlizzCon.
2585000	2588880	And then the week after that, or two weeks after that is Final Fantasy Fan Fest, which
2588880	2591880	I'm, which I realize not as many people are into, but I am.
2591880	2594100	So it's like, Oh, back to back to back stuff.
2594100	2595100	So crazy.
2595100	2596100	Crazy.
2596100	2597100	Anyway.
2597100	2598100	Uh, let's get into our gaming weeks.
2598100	2601480	Let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week, dark
2601480	2602480	soccer.
2602480	2603480	How was your gaming month?
2603480	2607320	Um, I've been playing a lot of Pokemon go.
2607320	2610280	Um, I'm still playing idle pouring.
2610280	2616320	I've gotten back into playing a lot of bejeweled because this is going to sound stupid, but
2616320	2619200	it really helps me relax right before bed.
2619200	2626120	Um, and I'm also, um, I've got my wow subscription, but I haven't played in a while, which I really
2626120	2630480	should now that people I know are playing and I kind of want to move my demon hunter
2630480	2632240	over to proud more.
2632240	2634440	I just need, you know, a guild to be in.
2634440	2635440	I'm proud more.
2635440	2642420	Um, other than the one I have, I need a, I need an Alliance Guild.
2642420	2645000	Talk to Delvin cause he's the one that hooked me up.
2645000	2646000	Yeah.
2646000	2649000	We also, you know, there's also communities, there's not just guild, but communities.
2649000	2650000	Yeah.
2650000	2651000	But I want to be in a guild.
2651000	2655820	But well I know, but also I was thinking anyway, just set up a community and somebody had the
2655820	2656820	brilliant idea.
2656820	2657820	I think that was me.
2657820	2658820	Was it you?
2658820	2659820	That conversation.
2659820	2660820	Yes.
2660820	2661820	You said call it death cake.
2662400	2664500	After the, our old final fantasy 11 guild that we all used to play in.
2664500	2667660	So other than that, I wanted to call it link shell.
2667660	2668660	Yeah.
2668660	2669660	I like that.
2669660	2670660	That would have been funny.
2670660	2671660	That's good.
2671660	2676580	Um, but I've been playing a lot of, um, uh, theater of magic because I fucking love theater
2676580	2682100	of magic and um, we may be selling a couple of our tables.
2682100	2684380	Local people hit us up.
2684380	2691480	Um, and then I'm consider, I'm trying to consider what I want to stream from PS one or Saturn
2691480	2695460	era and I'm leaning towards symphony of the night for Saturn.
2695460	2698280	For Maria, do the Maria stuff cause I've never really seen that.
2698280	2699520	I'd be into that.
2699520	2700520	Maria.
2700520	2705060	Maria can steamroll through the game cause all she needs, well actually one of her spells
2705060	2709160	is super hard to control and that's the Sadie one.
2709160	2710160	Okay.
2710160	2714080	So you know in Rondo how she has her little animal friend attacks Rob.
2714080	2715080	Yeah.
2715080	2716080	Okay.
2716080	2722280	So well in, in symphony, um, she has like, they all are like magic attacks and she can
2722280	2727800	summon like a big dragon that you can control over the screen.
2727800	2728800	It is insane.
2728800	2729800	Yeah.
2729800	2734240	Or like, you know, a firebird instead of her little sparrows, it's, it's pretty intense.
2734240	2738240	Except, you know, it's just not, not as pretty honestly enough as the PlayStation one, which
2738240	2741960	is really stupid given that Saturn had a better 2d processor.
2741960	2744480	Um, but I'm still trying to decide.
2744480	2747760	I'm also kind of thinking of getting out, you know, a translation guide and played through
2747760	2748760	blue seed RPG.
2748760	2749760	I don't know.
2749760	2750760	So.
2750760	2751760	All right.
2751760	2752760	We'll see.
2752760	2753760	All right.
2753760	2754760	Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
2754760	2759000	Um, my week was mainly just, uh, well a lot of dance has revolution.
2759000	2765800	So I was streaming most of this week, um, after work doing my, like I ended up being
2765800	2769000	in about like 45 minutes to 50 minutes a day.
2769000	2778560	So I catch that twitch.tv slash logy O R and then, um, beyond that, uh, Pokemon go and
2778560	2781040	then playing a bit of that.
2781040	2786760	And then also, um, a little bit of redhead redemption too, which is an excellent game.
2786760	2790560	Um, so I've been hopefully going to get into more of that.
2790560	2796140	Um, it was funny that I actually realized that like when I was downloading that, making
2796140	2799700	sure, well, of course I had enough hardware space cause I have a pro with a one terabyte
2799700	2802100	on there and only had 500.
2802100	2803100	I have a pro too.
2803100	2804160	And it's already full.
2804160	2808140	So yeah, well I haven't, I haven't been downloading a ton of stuff lately, but I noticed that
2808140	2811980	a lot of my VR stuff on there, I was like, Oh crap, I should read, don't download this
2811980	2812980	crap.
2812980	2813980	So I did that.
2813980	2820460	And then, um, I meant to play some PlayStation VR as well, but I didn't get around to that.
2820460	2821460	Unfortunately.
2821460	2825960	Uh, yeah, lots of, lots of stuff I need to get around to, but I just haven't bothered
2825960	2826960	yet.
2826960	2829960	And on the DER side, of course, it sounds like I'm going to be putting fourth mix plus
2829960	2830960	on my machine now.
2830960	2836760	Uh, which is fine cause I've been like kinda getting, it's a little stale with extreme
2836760	2837760	all the time.
2837760	2839800	Um, be nice to go back and play some of the older stuff.
2839800	2846980	I do miss not having my 1.5 speed and I have to remember now with the vivid, um, or no
2846980	2849000	vivid was, what was it?
2849000	2850000	The solo air.
2850000	2853920	I don't even know what I had to, I had to came up after was third mix.
2853920	2854920	Right.
2854920	2859760	I remember that vivid was a third mix, but I'm trying to think of like what mods I used
2859760	2863600	to put on there when I was playing, um, normally.
2863600	2868160	And I remember, I remember at the pocket station do custom nonstop.
2868160	2873520	So I'm actually, I don't have a memory card slot in my machine, uh, which is unfortunate.
2873520	2876200	And I had the opportunity to purchase one for like 150 bucks.
2876200	2878000	I passed up on that.
2878000	2882540	Now the only cheapest one I could find out $350, which I'm not buying, especially since
2882540	2887400	I'm planning on switching my machine over to a step mania machine at some point.
2887400	2892420	So I've actually been starting the prep work for that and the software side, picking out
2892420	2895040	what I want and theme wise and everything.
2895040	2898620	So that'll be coming some point soon, hopefully.
2898620	2901660	And then, um, yeah, more red dead.
2901660	2906140	I want to stream actual red dead and stuff and find a place to do like, you know, console
2906140	2911020	and PC streaming in my garage, but I don't have a lot of room in there and it's kind
2911020	2916180	of full of garbage right now and I need to like, you could get rid of the garbage.
2916180	2920780	You know, you think that would be easy, but a lot of it is like a lot of it is my stuff.
2920780	2926020	You know, like our garages, like houses disaster, like all my rock band stuff just sitting on
2926020	2927020	the side.
2927020	2928020	Did you play rock band?
2928020	2929020	Yeah.
2929020	2933860	But, um, I, yeah, it's, I have my 3d printing stuff out of the way and probably have some
2933860	2934860	room there.
2934860	2940260	Plus, there's no heat in the winter, so that'll be not as great, but better than the summer.
2940500	2942020	I'll take cold, liver, hot.
2942020	2943020	Yeah.
2943020	2945840	You know, as where, where layers, all right.
2945840	2950340	My gaming week, honestly, um, because again, I haven't been buying a lot of new games lately,
2950340	2954620	uh, just because, uh, I've been trying to watch the finances, uh, just because of some
2954620	2955620	personal stuff.
2955620	2960220	Um, but, uh, I would say I've been playing more world, world of Warcraft, uh, which I
2960220	2964100	never thought I would like be playing it this much, but, uh, I've just kind of been into
2964100	2967740	it and I finally kind of hit a point where I was kind of, I got my brew master monk up
2967740	2972180	to about level 60 and then I was like, I want to, I need to get back to trying to do
2972180	2973180	the end game stuff.
2973180	2975740	So I finally used my boost on a warlock.
2975740	2980300	And so I started playing warlock just the other night and, uh, I'm, I'm loving how fast
2980300	2981300	things melt.
2981300	2986180	Like I forgot how much easier it is to quest as DPS as it is a tank or a healer.
2986180	2989740	Uh, so that's, that's been really great and I'm liking warlock so far.
2989740	2996140	So, uh, I hit level 111 earlier this weekend, so I'm making my way up slowly to 120, which
2996140	2997860	I'll hopefully hit, uh, before too long.
2997860	2999180	So that would be very nice.
2999180	3002260	Um, otherwise, uh, I'm also still playing Pokemon go.
3002260	3005420	I just got my little reward, the spirit tomb.
3005420	3008660	I just got that from the, uh, the quest that they gave you for Halloween.
3008660	3013340	So I just got that today cause I finally, you know how you have to do 108 Pokemon with
3013340	3014340	berries, right?
3014340	3017380	Well, if you weren't already aware, did you already finish it?
3017380	3018380	Because guess what?
3018380	3019860	After you do that, you get to do 108 more.
3019860	3020860	I did that.
3020860	3021860	Oh good.
3021860	3022860	Oh, so you got your spirit too.
3022860	3024380	My poofy weird looking thing.
3024380	3025380	Nice.
3025620	3029580	You know, what's funny is I have that, but I still am stuck on that quest that is visit
3029580	3032540	eight pokey stops you haven't visited before.
3032540	3033860	Did that finish it today?
3033860	3035100	Oh nice.
3035100	3036100	Because I guess what?
3036100	3041140	I got seven yesterday at the wedding and I need one more.
3041140	3046700	I got, I got one in, um, uh, on flooring.
3046700	3050900	I got six in, um, old town, Elk Grove.
3050900	3051900	Oh yeah.
3051900	3052900	There's a bunch of stuff down there.
3052900	3053900	I never went down there before.
3054420	3057900	And then I got the last one downtown around the corner from the LGBT center.
3057900	3058900	Yeah.
3058900	3059900	There's a button.
3059900	3060900	I mean, obviously there's a bunch of stuff downtown.
3060900	3062260	I can find one easy.
3062260	3065980	It's just a matter of like being, you know, honestly, I don't think I've been over to
3065980	3068860	like the park in Rancho, the big park in Rancho Cordova.
3068860	3071680	I don't think I've spun the stops over there since the game started tracking it.
3071680	3072680	So you know what?
3072680	3073680	I can probably just go over there.
3073680	3074680	It's not a big deal.
3074680	3079120	It's just taking the effort when, what do you have to, I'm sorry, you have to spend
3079120	3080120	new stops.
3080120	3083500	You have to do, well, the weird thing is you get the spirit tomb from when you catch the
3083500	3087780	108 Pokemon, but part of the quest chain is still, you have another quest where you
3087780	3090460	have to spin eight pokestops you haven't spun before.
3090460	3096980	Oh, see that would have been nice when I just went to Santa Clara where it was all new stuff
3096980	3097980	anyway.
3097980	3099580	I mean, there's still places I haven't been.
3099580	3100580	Yeah.
3100580	3104660	Well, and I'm, I'm going to Vegas in a couple of weeks and I'll get a billion pokestops
3104660	3108260	I haven't got before there, but that, but then that quest will be kind of gone.
3108260	3109580	I'm sure I'll get one more stop.
3109580	3111300	I haven't been to yet at some point.
3111300	3112780	I'm sure that's inevitable.
3113060	3119260	I still need the trade of Pokemon for one of the ones I have now because I'm on the
3119260	3120260	six or whatever.
3120260	3122540	I can trade you a garbage Pokemon if that's all you need.
3122540	3125940	Well, I think I need the trade like, yeah, yeah, we can, yeah, whatever.
3125940	3128540	Just trade, catch something on the house and trade it to me.
3128540	3129540	It's easy.
3129540	3130540	Oh, I've got plenty of stuff.
3130540	3131540	There you go.
3131540	3132540	There you go.
3132540	3133540	I had a dust skull that, well, I think I threw it away.
3133540	3137700	I had a shiny dust skull, but I gave you unknown from dragon con, right?
3137700	3138700	No.
3138700	3139700	Okay, done.
3139700	3140700	I'll give you an unknown from dragon con.
3140700	3141700	All right.
3141700	3142700	Woo.
3143620	3144620	I have so many of those.
3144620	3145620	I have so many of them in my inventory.
3145620	3146620	All right.
3146620	3147620	Anyway.
3147620	3148620	It's like another.
3148620	3149620	Well, yeah, I was like, I gave you one.
3149620	3150620	You gave me the D.
3150620	3151620	Okay.
3151620	3152620	Yes, right.
3152620	3154180	I gave you the D. It's the only time in my life I've ever given Jamie the D.
3154180	3160500	It's the only time in my life I've ever wanted the D. Also, it was kind of cute.
3160500	3162500	Oh, thank you.
3162500	3165420	She thought his D was cute.
3165420	3168580	We are talking about unknowns that were caught at dragon con.
3168580	3170020	Thank you very much.
3170020	3172300	Anyway, uh, I guess that's it for my gaming week.
3172300	3174300	Let's get into some gaming news.
3174300	3177180	Some announcements real quick, actually, before we do news.
3177180	3181380	We will not be here on November 18th.
3181380	3182660	So that is a few weeks away.
3182660	3185140	That is right before Thanksgiving.
3185140	3189260	Uh, I will be at the final fantasy fan fest in Vegas, and that is the day we're coming
3189260	3190260	back.
3190260	3191860	So I won't get back in time for the show, sadly.
3191860	3194060	So, uh, no show that week.
3194060	3195060	Okay.
3195060	3197180	Um, let's get into some gaming news, Loki.
3197180	3201300	So this is kind of funny that I just read that they're doing this because I thought
3201300	3203340	it already was on PC.
3203340	3208820	In fact, I almost bought the game pass, um, when I got Forza.
3208820	3212520	Um, but apparently this is a new thing.
3212520	3218040	So Microsoft is considering, or they're, they're intending on expanding the Xbox game pass
3218040	3220460	program to PC as well.
3220460	3227260	Apparently they said that with the increased growth of gaming, um, rising or the revenue
3227260	3233220	rising 44% that they are, um, and their service earnings increased by 36%.
3233220	3238820	This is coming out of their, uh, financial year 2019 quarter one earnings report, um,
3238820	3245500	that they're going to, um, this, I guess this rise in, um, earnings led them to discuss,
3245500	3249560	Hey, maybe we should ask, should we expand this, you know, cross-platform like we are
3249560	3251300	doing with their other games?
3251300	3256220	Um, and so with that, you know, they said that it would fall under the titles.
3256220	3258680	That would be the Xbox play anywhere label.
3258680	3262620	And so with that, you would get, you know, like fours of the horizon, three, four gears
3262620	3269660	of war for, um, so that's going to be included with the $10 monthly subscription.
3269660	3275740	So yeah, I'm surprised, like, I swear, I thought that was already a thing that they had game
3275740	3277860	pass that it would apply.
3277860	3281600	Basically there would be any of the game anywhere titles because you're getting access to this
3281600	3282820	library on the Xbox.
3282820	3286540	And so just because you have it on PC, you can get access to those.
3286540	3291340	Um, I'm not sure windows 10 was set up necessarily to support that, but I imagine the recent
3291340	3295020	updates they've been doing, but I can purchase it through the windows 10 store though.
3295020	3296020	Right.
3296020	3298740	That's where it like, cause I even when I was going with game pass, we're using game
3298740	3299740	pass.
3299740	3303140	No, I wasn't like at the point I was like, I was planning on purchasing Forza and it's
3303140	3307400	like, do you want to purchase Forza or you can get it free with game pass and like this
3307400	3309060	is on the windows 10 store.
3309060	3310060	Oh, interesting.
3310060	3312020	So that's why I thought this was already a thing.
3312020	3314180	I was like, Oh, well they already have it.
3314180	3319140	It's just, it's not that great on PC because it's only the play anywhere titles.
3319140	3321860	Like I can't go play red dead redemption all of a sudden on PC.
3321860	3324820	Well, I imagine it will be expanding significantly too.
3324820	3327660	I think Microsoft's really kind of shifted focus a little bit down.
3327660	3333620	I mean that's, that's not bad, but, um, yeah, I guess we'll have to wait and see when that
3333620	3334900	that comes out.
3334900	3338340	Uh, yeah, the more and more like game pass keeps expanding and stuff.
3338340	3340260	I gotta say I'm really tempted with it.
3340260	3344420	I really, really, as if I don't have enough of a backlog, like, but game pass got a lot
3344420	3345420	of good stuff.
3345420	3346820	Um, so yeah, that's the thing.
3346820	3350500	Like if they have a lot of like first party tiles, it'd be nice to go back and play some
3350500	3351500	of the stuff I haven't played.
3351500	3356900	But honestly, on PC it's mainly like Forza, it's like Forza, Forza, Forza, Forza and
3356900	3357900	Gears of War.
3357900	3361700	And I guess, you know, when the Halo stuff comes out, you know, that might be a little
3361700	3362700	worth it too.
3362700	3363700	But yeah.
3363700	3364700	All right.
3364700	3369100	Well, uh, moving on to another story about Pokemon go clones.
3369100	3371780	I don't know if you've tried some of the various Pokemon go clones out there.
3371780	3372780	I have not.
3372780	3375540	My sister plays the Jurassic Park one all the time.
3375540	3377500	I was going to say some of them are pretty good.
3377500	3383280	I hear the Jurassic Park one's pretty well received the, uh, walking, walking dead, which
3383280	3387980	I haven't played yet, but I hear there's people into that one too, uh, that that one is pretty
3387980	3389020	fun as well.
3389020	3390820	And then there's some pretty crappy ones too.
3390820	3395500	Like Garfield go is, is like, LOL stupid, really dog shit.
3395500	3396500	Yeah.
3396500	3400620	Well, I dare you to talk bad about this Pokemon go clone because you might go to hell for
3400620	3402300	making fun of this one.
3402300	3405000	It is JC go.
3405000	3408220	It was designed by a Catholic evangelical group.
3408220	3413040	They don't say Pope Francis as apparently blessed JC go.
3413040	3415780	I'll let you guess what JC stands for.
3415780	3421360	Uh, apparently, uh, this was a game that was made in preparation for world youth day 2019.
3421360	3426680	That is a Catholic youth event that will be happening in Panama up in January.
3426680	3432020	Um, obviously you would not be throwing little balls at saints and Catholics and stuff to
3432020	3435640	capture them, uh, to enslave them in the ball to do your bidding.
3435640	3436640	So it's a little bit different.
3436640	3441680	So what happens is that they join your evangelization team.
3441680	3445760	If you can answer questions about the Bible, that's right.
3445760	3447880	It's a Bible quiz game.
3447880	3452080	So talk about edutainment games.
3452080	3454120	I remember the years.
3454120	3457640	People don't know this, but I went to church for several years and I used to be pretty
3457640	3458640	good at them.
3458640	3459640	Bible quizzes.
3459640	3460640	I used to be able to recite the books.
3460640	3461640	You know what?
3461640	3462640	What?
3462640	3463640	I did Bible drill.
3463640	3468960	Did you, what's Bible drill where like you have to memorize whole passages and Oh wow.
3468960	3473680	Find anything in the Bible and you know, be able to do, you know, they give you one book
3473680	3478320	you have to see what's before and what's after and it was stupid.
3478320	3482600	I gotta be honest, like, but I won like third place in one.
3482600	3487000	Like anytime I hear about these, like, you know, and maybe just because I'm not religious,
3487000	3489280	but like it just seems so forced.
3489280	3492320	You mean, and it's always like a knockoff of something.
3492320	3497640	It's like, I don't have a problem with you creating like edutainment.
3497640	3500120	That's you know, original.
3500120	3503240	That's you know, religious based, but like stop knocking shit off.
3503240	3507520	Like I remember when I was dating someone that was going to tell that to the Pope.
3507520	3508520	Stop knocking shit off.
3508520	3509520	Yes.
3509520	3511760	I am going to tell them to tell them, it's like, dude, fucking come up with your own
3511760	3512760	original shit.
3512760	3513760	You know what?
3513760	3514760	Seriously.
3514760	3520200	Um, no, I, I used to like date someone that was like really, really just stop touching
3520200	3521200	little boys.
3521200	3526160	And, and I remember going to her church group and they would like, they would quote unquote
3526160	3527160	jam and shit.
3527160	3530840	And they would just like come up with like these religious lyrics to fucking just like
3530840	3532640	normal songs.
3532640	3534680	Like, you know, like they were being alternate.
3534680	3535680	Yeah.
3535680	3539720	Basically like the, you know, they were doing alternative lyrics to, you know, um, my name
3539720	3544920	is, you know, like, you know, they were, you know, my name is Jesus.
3544920	3545920	Yeah, I know.
3545920	3546920	I don't.
3546920	3547920	Yeah.
3547920	3550240	It's just like, I'm like, it's so cringy.
3550240	3551240	It's just cringy.
3551240	3552240	Awful.
3552240	3555840	It makes me think of that comment that was said earlier about the edutainment games that
3555840	3557720	there's a lot of kids that kind of see right through it.
3557720	3558720	You know?
3559040	3562660	Just don't like, I get it.
3562660	3564560	It's popular, but you know what?
3564560	3568080	Come up with something original and not just like fucking knock it off.
3568080	3572520	Like come up with something that is unique.
3572520	3576700	So you, what you would like, what, what if, what if they were to rip off like street fighter?
3576700	3582320	What if there was like, you know, seen that though, I really, they had a Jesus game that
3582320	3588160	is street fighter like types of, it's all these different religious deities.
3588160	3589480	The Pope didn't like that one.
3589480	3594120	And Santa Claus is in there too, because of course, but it is all these religious deities
3594120	3595120	fighting each other.
3595120	3598960	So they do have that already, but I mean, that's not supposed to be taken seriously
3598960	3599960	at all.
3599960	3601520	It's just, it's silly, but.
3601520	3603640	And I don't think the Pope is a fan of that one.
3603640	3611280	I just, I'm sorry, just, it seems very, out of all the religions that I've had contact
3611280	3616000	with in, in my lifetime, I feel that like Christianity, and maybe it's not Christianity,
3616000	3619240	I'm just bundling all of like those religions as Christianity.
3619240	3621600	So I'm not going to like Lutheran.
3621600	3625920	I fucking don't know Catholic, it's all fucking Christianity to me.
3625920	3626920	Dominations thereof.
3626920	3627920	Yes, whatever.
3627920	3629960	I am ignorant.
3629960	3630960	That is it.
3630960	3631960	I am ignorant.
3631960	3633280	Can someone just clip that?
3633280	3634280	I am ignorant.
3634280	3635280	Can someone just clip that?
3635280	3636280	I am ignorant to your religions.
3636280	3638080	Can I play that on a future show?
3638080	3643560	Out of all of the religions that I have had exposure to, Christianity is the only one
3643560	3647280	that's trying to like actively recruit you into, it's like trying to fucking save you
3647280	3650380	and it's irritating as shit to me.
3650380	3653400	Like get it, you're happy with your religion, cool.
3653400	3654400	It's funny.
3654400	3655400	You know, it's funny.
3655400	3657680	And I don't want to get into the religion debate too far, we've already gone far enough.
3657680	3658680	Not all religions do that.
3658680	3663840	I know, I know of at least one that you have to ask several times to be a part of it.
3663840	3668040	So like, I'm, I'm cool with, if you're happy with it, cool.
3668040	3670240	That that's your cup of tea, not my cup of tea.
3670240	3675640	I'm not hating you for, but dude, it's just, it seems so forced and this is just seems
3675640	3676640	kind of forced as well.
3676640	3678960	It's like, come up with something different.
3678960	3683840	If you can make a fun game and also teach religion at the same time, more power to you.
3683840	3684840	Same thing.
3684840	3688400	Like if you can make a game that's fun, that teaches you about fucking Oregon Trail, like
3688400	3694560	if that, that game wasn't out, we probably know shit about, you know, there was, okay.
3694560	3698800	You know, I will say there was a game I used to play at the mine shaft, the arcade years
3698800	3699800	ago.
3699800	3703760	And they had, because you know, that place was like secretly like a Mormon stronghold,
3703760	3705280	you know, the, the mine shaft.
3705280	3708720	So they actually had upstairs, they had a couple of games and one of them was Noah's
3708720	3713960	Ark and in this Noah's Ark game, you were trying to pair up animals and take them on
3713960	3714960	the Ark.
3714960	3716880	And I actually played this game cause I thought it was fun.
3716880	3717880	It was a fun game.
3717880	3718880	Exactly.
3718880	3721120	That's how you get people interested in stuff.
3721120	3723440	Not just like, whatever, you know what?
3723440	3724440	It's fine.
3724440	3725440	It's not for me.
3725440	3728520	I, why am I complaining about a game that's not for me?
3728520	3729520	As you always do.
3729520	3731040	It's like me complaining about sports games.
3731040	3735200	I mean, anybody that's getting a little nerve to buy some of your religious discussion,
3735200	3738760	you would, you would treat any game like this really.
3738760	3740000	I don't get it.
3740000	3741000	It's fine.
3741000	3743280	I just, and this is any game that's like trying this shit.
3743280	3744280	That's any game.
3744280	3748240	Like even like the Jurassic parks, I was like, really, really lost world, really, really
3748240	3749240	Ghostbusters.
3749240	3752740	You fucking need to make a goddamn, you know, Pokemon go clone.
3752740	3757900	Just fucking come up with some of the original, Ingress is different than Pokemon go.
3757900	3761300	They're both AR games, but they're played completely fucking different.
3761300	3766460	But everybody, because Pokemon goes popular, everything's gotta be catching some bullshit
3766460	3769380	and like training it and trading and bull.
3769380	3773720	It's just fucking Pokemon go make a different AR game.
3773720	3777300	And that's why I'm kind of excited for Harry Potter, because since Niantic's involved there
3777300	3783160	too, it's going to likely be a different game than Ingress prime, which we have to kind
3783160	3785900	of say Ingress prime now, because that's starting to roll out.
3785900	3790940	A lot of my friends are playing Ingress prime now, uh, that's because that's the scanner
3790940	3792780	that's going to replace Ingress in November.
3792780	3797260	But anyway, uh, Ingress prime and, um, uh, Pokemon go, Harry Potter is sure to be different.
3797260	3798540	I'm really excited about it.
3798540	3800740	So yeah, that'll be neat.
3800740	3806740	That'll try because I, you know, I like their track record, buggish fucking shit.
3806740	3807740	Oh yeah.
3807740	3808740	Speaking of Niantic.
3808740	3809740	Oh boy.
3809740	3814980	You know, so I saw that they have that update now where it's going to be tracking your,
3814980	3818940	you know, basically doing what it's supposed to be doing, which is coming up later in the
3818940	3819940	show.
3819940	3820940	So watch what you say.
3820940	3826020	But like to that I had to laugh because like I use, you know, a gotcha or whatever and
3826020	3830260	I keep the app, I just keep my phone like asleep as I'm doing that.
3830260	3833660	And that app crashes so fucking often in my pocket.
3833660	3835420	It's just like, really?
3835420	3838360	You're going to, you're going to be tracking this in the background because fucking your
3838360	3841940	app cannot stay open for like more than five minutes anyways.
3841940	3844220	Well, I think there's a way it may still work.
3844220	3847300	We'll talk a little more about that later in the show when we get to that.
3847300	3848300	So all right.
3848300	3851020	But for now, let's go to another story from Dark Sakura.
3851020	3852540	Yeah.
3852540	3862320	So at any rate, there is a few actually interesting things going on in the print world.
3862320	3866060	First of all, we all know what Raspberry Pi is, right?
3866060	3867060	Delicious.
3867060	3868060	Yes.
3868060	3871980	A delicious tiny little thing for your TV that's basically a computer.
3871980	3872980	Yeah.
3872980	3876740	That is a tiny computer to make it easier to get into computing.
3876740	3883100	Well, they are doing a magazine dedicated to video game development and video gaming
3883100	3885260	called Wireframe.
3885260	3890700	And even better, they're giving away 10,000 free copies of the first edition if you register
3890700	3892540	on their website.
3892540	3899580	I put in for it, by the way, it's two pound shipping to the U.S. from the U.K.
3899580	3906940	But it's also going to be, you know, money that's used to buy the print version will
3906940	3912780	go back in to keep the Raspberry Pi foundation going so that they can keep making low cost
3912780	3914760	computers for people.
3914760	3919740	They also own other publications, including the Mag Pi and Hack Space magazine, which
3919740	3923940	is under Raspberry Pi Press.
3923940	3926740	But Wireframe itself is going to be more indie focused.
3926740	3928340	So that will be really good.
3928340	3934640	They actually have things like mods, early access games, development tools, all kinds
3934640	3935640	of neat stuff.
3935640	3941900	So I did actually decide it would be worth it to get in a little bit on this and ordered
3941900	3946860	the first issue, which will go on sale officially on November 8th, 2018.
3946860	3952300	And we'll have an interview with the creative director for Assassin's Creed 3 and Far Cry
3952300	3953820	4, Alex Hutchinson.
3953820	3955500	So we'll see.
3955500	3956500	Nice.
3956500	3962300	I need to get me one of these things and, you know, for science, for science, absolutely.
3962300	3965380	I bet a Raspberry Pi would probably be more powerful than the computer we're using now
3965380	3966380	to do O.L.R.
3966380	3967380	You want to know what?
3967380	3969540	Can a Raspberry Pi run Windows 10?
3969540	3972020	That's probably true.
3972020	3973760	You and I need to talk.
3973760	3974760	Do we?
3974760	3977860	But we always talk.
3977860	3980220	We need to repeat a conversation that we've had.
3980220	3981220	All right.
3981220	3982220	Let's move on.
3982220	3984420	A few more stories where we get to the classic game of the week.
3984420	3985420	Loki.
3985420	3992560	Apparently, with the release of Soul Calibur 6, there's been, you know, some shenanigans
3992560	3995300	being done with the create a character mode.
3995300	4001180	So apparently, I really I guess you can take these creative characters, the custom characters
4001180	4005020	online and actually play ranked matches with them, which is a little weird.
4005020	4007220	Yeah, I think I think that is the thing you can do.
4007220	4009340	And so you imagine it.
4009340	4014140	Someone's done it, you know, took like five seconds for someone to do Bowsette in Soul
4014140	4015140	Calibur 6.
4015140	4019340	So now there's these troll characters that appear online because what they're doing is
4019340	4023260	they're using the create a character mode on PC and, of course, using a cheat engine
4023260	4029980	or something like that to be able to go beyond the bounds of what is available on those sliders,
4029980	4033180	which I'm glad that they have no anti-sanity check.
4033180	4036460	Thanks a lot, Namco Bandai.
4036460	4042520	But so now you have things like this dude that's in a giant cube or basically the cube
4042520	4043520	that they're fighting.
4043520	4045400	You can't see the person in the cube.
4045400	4046400	You see this giant cube.
4046400	4049280	So it's hard to judge where the person is to play that.
4049280	4052240	So they've done that.
4052240	4057960	And also, I guess the guy that was behind it, Abok, he was also showing off how you
4057960	4058960	can do this yourself.
4058960	4061800	So he made a giant apple as well.
4061800	4065360	And then there's a nice little picture that I saw with someone that made a giant dick
4065360	4069080	because the TTP in anything is immediately.
4069080	4070080	Yes.
4070600	4073840	And Red Dead Redemption also saw a picture because of the wonderful snow physics that
4073840	4075960	they have that you can walk and you can see the trail.
4075960	4077880	Someone also walked in the shape of a penis.
4077880	4078880	You don't say.
4078880	4079880	Yes.
4079880	4080880	You don't say.
4080880	4084760	Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Bob Coffey says lizard dongs are a big problem
4084760	4085920	in Soul Calibur 6.
4085920	4088040	I don't even know if that's a joke or a true statement.
4088040	4091360	It's got to be a true statement.
4091360	4096840	But yeah, so it's kind of weird, though, that I'm assuming this is going to get patched
4096840	4097840	out.
4097840	4099240	They've got to put some sort of sanity checks in there.
4099240	4103000	You know, hey, you know, is this between this and this value?
4103000	4105880	If not, you know, flag this or whatever.
4105880	4107720	I'm surprised that that's not a thing.
4107720	4113760	But that's as I like to call it at work, MVP, Minimal Viable Product.
4113760	4116600	All right.
4116600	4120340	Let's talk about something else that is probably like the minimum of what they can offer because
4120340	4123640	there's going to be a lot of problems with this, I think, and that is the PlayStation
4123640	4125800	name change feature.
4125800	4129320	As we have already discussed, the name change feature probably isn't going to work with
4129320	4132940	a lot of old PlayStation games because it's only going to be guaranteed to work with games
4132940	4135200	after a certain date or beyond.
4135200	4139200	And even then, apparently, some of the beta testers are learning that name changes may
4139200	4144440	actually make you lose access to content like paid DLC for your games.
4144440	4147960	Things like leaderboard data, progress towards trophies.
4147960	4148960	Not all the time.
4148960	4150760	I want to stress, not all the time.
4150760	4154040	But in some cases, this is getting messed up.
4154080	4158520	Why are we implementing a feature that breaks things like I don't want it?
4158520	4159520	It is a beta.
4159520	4160520	Let's be fair.
4160520	4161520	Betas.
4161520	4166480	When we test these things that come to light in the hopes that Sony will fix them.
4166480	4168680	But it's not looking good so far.
4168680	4173300	Like honestly, y'all just probably want to keep the names you've got right now.
4173300	4177200	Maybe wait for PlayStation five before you start making some big change.
4177200	4179560	I got to say, honestly, like fuck that.
4179560	4183680	I mean, like, I'll just wait for the next fucking Microsoft console to be honest.
4183680	4184880	This is ridiculous.
4184880	4189600	Bobby Blackwolf in chat suggests, even if it's broken, just give me the option.
4189600	4192920	Some people want to change their name that badly.
4192920	4195800	Even if it's broken, give me the option.
4195800	4197760	I'm not changing my name, so I'm good.
4197760	4198760	Yeah, I know.
4198760	4199760	I'm in a weird place.
4199760	4201600	It's like, I'm not really interested in changing my name.
4201600	4204480	Like I'm not like Rob Roberts on PlayStation, but that's what I'm like.
4204480	4205480	I'm okay with that.
4205480	4206480	It's fine.
4206480	4212880	Plus PlayStation allows you to link to Facebook and like, you know, if we're going to be PlayStation
4212880	4215360	friends, we're probably Facebook friends.
4215360	4217080	And that's a really good way to find people.
4217080	4223680	So like I kind of the names don't really matter when you have that sort of integration, but
4223680	4227680	that's just at least my, I don't know, my thing.
4227680	4228920	All right.
4228920	4229920	Interesting.
4229920	4234840	We have a user in our chat at live.vognetwork.com named Protect the Second who says, it's so
4234840	4239640	funny because I made my PlayStation network the same I have on this IRC and they made
4239640	4240640	me change it.
4240640	4242020	It changed no problem.
4242020	4244940	So weird that this has taken so long to make a feature.
4244940	4247180	So if they don't like your name, you can change it easily.
4247180	4252220	Well, that is an interesting counterpoint is that if they force you to do a name change
4252220	4258200	because you know, you have something in your name that either you, you get a name clash
4258200	4261060	with a famous person that wants like, you can't name yourself Lady Gaga.
4261060	4265460	So if Lady Gaga wants that name, she gets it, uh, whether you like it or not, uh, or
4265460	4269020	something that is quote unquote offensive.
4269020	4274500	I'm not, oh, cause her name is really Stephanie.
4274500	4275500	I see what she did there.
4275500	4280660	I go, she's so I'd be pissed if that was the case, honestly, like, you know, Oh, well,
4280660	4281660	I'm sorry.
4281660	4282660	I want this thing.
4282660	4284940	Well, no, no, but it's weird that they could force you to change it.
4284940	4285940	It doesn't have any problems.
4285940	4291660	If I was Lady Gaga, like back when, you know, the PS3 came out or whatever like that.
4291660	4295060	And then for whatever reason, she decided to get in the game and wanted to be called
4295060	4296060	Lady Gaga.
4296060	4297060	They would just, okay.
4297100	4299940	I know this is a hypothetical situation, but like, I'd be fucking pissed.
4299940	4301780	Let's say you have like an offensive name.
4301780	4306140	Like let's say you took your hatred of JC go too far and you made a handle on PlayStation
4306140	4307140	network.
4307140	4308140	JC go to hell.
4308140	4309140	Yeah.
4309140	4310140	Okay.
4310140	4311140	You made it.
4311140	4312280	You made JC go to hell and somebody's going to say, you know what?
4312280	4317400	Go to hell is not a nice thing to say on PlayStation network when kids could be on it playing Minecraft.
4317400	4321840	So they're going to force you to change your name away from JC go to hell so they can force
4321840	4324720	you to change your name and it works fine apparently.
4324720	4327320	So why doesn't it work in this case?
4327320	4328320	It's weird.
4328320	4329320	It's very strange.
4329320	4334820	Anyway, uh, Bobby Black Wolf suggests they probably have a complicated manual system
4334820	4338920	that they can do behind the scenes to allow the forced name change, which is not something
4338920	4342920	they can replicate in an automatic way that is consumer facing.
4342920	4346320	It all goes back to the whole, they made a bad design.
4346320	4349600	So all right.
4349600	4354280	D'artistsuya in chat says along those lines to what Rob was saying over on Nintendo, I
4354320	4357720	found a Miss Vangie on Splatoon 2.
4357720	4358720	She even added me.
4358720	4363920	Though I don't know if it's just a fan or what, uh, video games, drag queen, likely
4363920	4364920	OLR listener.
4364920	4365920	Yes.
4365920	4368920	I don't know.
4368920	4370880	Dark Sakura is your, is your Nintendo name?
4370880	4371880	Miss Vangie?
4371880	4372880	No.
4372880	4375480	I don't think it's just Dark Sakura.
4375480	4376880	All right.
4376880	4378720	Anyway, uh, let's move on.
4378720	4381200	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us next in the news?
4381200	4382960	The library of Congress.
4382960	4385360	Oh, the library is open.
4385360	4386360	Yeah.
4386360	4388440	I'll read something about the government.
4388440	4389440	No.
4389440	4395040	Um, anyway, uh, the library of Congress in the US Copyright Office revised its list of
4395040	4400240	specific exceptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the DMCA.
4400240	4408560	Um, it now has expanded, um, the ability to revive and protect older games as well as
4408560	4416560	DIY repairs to systems to break DRM to fix the hardware.
4416560	4422160	Basically, um, it's, it's all in the name of preserving old games.
4422160	4428120	In fact, um, they gave libraries and archives as well as museums their right to circumvent
4428120	4432720	DRM so that video games can be preserved in playable condition.
4432720	4437200	And so this year's list actually reaffirmed and expanded that a little bit.
4437240	4443080	So, um, an additional section there actually calls out instances where online authentication
4443080	4445440	is required in order to play games.
4445440	4450200	Um, once a copyright holder shuts down authentication services, consumers now have the right to
4450200	4453320	break DRM in order to play games.
4453320	4458640	So yes, you can copy that floppy in order to play a game that can no longer validate
4458640	4460440	you online.
4460440	4463760	And I know this was a big, um, kind of back and forth in the gaming industry.
4463760	4465160	Uh, just not that long ago.
4465160	4467320	So we were talking about, you know, servers coming down and so forth.
4467320	4468720	So this is a pretty big deal.
4468720	4473000	Well, it goes into effect as of today.
4473000	4477000	So huzzah, I'm sure there are going to be some court challenges coming up.
4477000	4482720	I'd really like to see how it pans out, but for right now, do the thing.
4482720	4487160	You can copy that floppy all you want in this context and this context only.
4487160	4489280	Break that DRM for preservation.
4489280	4490280	Not the new stuff.
4490280	4491280	So, all right.
4491280	4494440	Only when the servers get taken offline, which, um,
4494440	4495440	Final Fantasy 11.
4495440	4496440	Woo!
4496440	4497440	Yeah.
4497440	4498440	Right.
4498440	4499440	And some other games too, right?
4499440	4500440	Logie?
4500440	4501440	Yes.
4501440	4502440	Other games like Warhawk on PS3.
4502440	4507560	Apparently there's a couple of people that are up in arms about the fact that it was
4507560	4512200	announced that they would be shutting down their servers on October 25th as opposed to
4512200	4516680	the 90 day window that they're supposed to give us according to the back of the box.
4516680	4522680	Um, previous games that they did shut down like recently at, well, not so recent, SOCOM,
4522680	4527600	they shut down their servers August 31st, 2012, and they did announce that 90 days
4527600	4529160	in advance, but Warhawk, not so much.
4529160	4535240	I got to wonder how many people are actually playing Warhawk, so, uh, but another one bites
4535240	4539800	the dust, but I'm guessing that there was really no one playing that game.
4539800	4542560	Maybe that's why I didn't do notice.
4542560	4547960	Yeah, I'm guessing a lot of these games probably aren't super trafficked anyway, but you never
4547960	4548960	know.
4548960	4549960	Yeah.
4549960	4552600	I'm sure it made somebody angry enough to write an article about it.
4552600	4558000	Uh, Destiny 100 Matt, uh, eulogizing a bit, says Warhawk was a fun game at its time.
4558000	4562880	Well, hey, you know, thanks to this Library of Congress decision, you can bring it back.
4562880	4566720	Well, I mean, this is, you know, it's funny though with the Warhawk thing is like, they
4566720	4567720	could bring it back.
4567720	4571280	They just put it as part of like a PlayStation Now thing and then you can play it online
4571280	4572280	still.
4572280	4574480	I guess they probably just don't make enough money to run those servers.
4574480	4576520	It's not beneficial for them.
4576520	4577520	All right.
4577520	4581840	Uh, let's see, let's talk about Dreamcast games coming to the Switch.
4581840	4582840	Yep, that's right.
4582840	4586520	You might get to relive your favorite Dreamcast classics all over again.
4586520	4592240	This coming from a recent, uh, talk with Famitsu where Naoki Horii from Sega talked about how
4592240	4598160	the Switch was getting very close to successfully running the Dreamcast titles, uh, via emulation,
4598160	4599160	which would not be surprising.
4599160	4600160	They were doing it on PC.
4600160	4601880	They invented it on other consoles.
4601880	4603360	So why not the Switch as well?
4603360	4607340	So they could theoretically remake or port certain Dreamcast games.
4607340	4608340	So sure.
4608340	4609340	Why not?
4609340	4610640	Space Channel Five all over again.
4610640	4611700	Crazy Taxi.
4611700	4612700	Why not?
4612700	4613700	But you know what?
4613700	4616640	Where's the, I mean, I know it's not a Sega game, but like when I think of Dreamcast,
4616640	4617640	I think of Power Stone.
4617640	4622320	I was just going to say like, it's not a Dreamcast game, but like Power Stone, please.
4622320	4625480	The best we got was PSP I think had a Power Stone.
4625480	4631240	It was PSP or Vida got a Power Stone collection of one and two, I believe.
4631240	4632240	I think it was PS.
4632240	4635160	No, it must have been Vida.
4635160	4640640	I don't think PSP would have had Power Stone, but it was one of the Sony portable systems
4640640	4642240	that got that.
4642240	4646200	Um, but yeah, I, I would love a new Power Stone game.
4646200	4647920	It would be awesome.
4647920	4651000	Or even some of those characters coming over to like a Street Fighter game or something
4651000	4652000	like that.
4652000	4653000	Yeah.
4653000	4656000	At least, uh, at least it would be nice if somebody would like take the concept, but
4656000	4659720	I guess, um, they are, uh, it was PSP.
4659720	4660720	Okay.
4660720	4664080	I guess Capcom is talking about bringing some of their old stuff back, kind of.
4664080	4666160	They had a tweet about it this week.
4666160	4672040	Uh, Bobby Blackwolf suggests Seaman HD, a popular Dreamcast game that always comes up
4672040	4673040	on OLR.
4673040	4674040	That is supposed to be coming.
4674040	4675040	There's supposed to be a new Seaman coming.
4675040	4678200	I thought there would, they're working on a new Seaman.
4678200	4683400	So whenever that happens, didn't they, was it like a Kickstarter or something?
4683400	4684920	I thought that they were doing that.
4684920	4685920	Yeah.
4685920	4688020	I thought I remember that being a thing that we talked about earlier too.
4688020	4694180	So orange right suggests considering that Parappa port essentially ran on a PSP emulator
4694180	4696580	and apparently Castlevania might be a similar situation.
4696580	4699620	I can see Capcom releasing Power Stone on PlayStation four.
4699620	4701500	You just, you just need to scream.
4701500	4704260	You need to passively, aggressively tweet Capcom enough.
4704260	4705260	No, I'm just kidding.
4705260	4708740	Be respectful, but you know, let them know, let them know the demand is out there.
4708740	4709960	So all right.
4709960	4713640	And yeah, dark to see you confirming what I saw on Twitter, uh, Capcom's confirmed that
4713640	4717380	they're putting Resident Evil zero, Resident Evil four on switch.
4717420	4721300	So you get to buy Resident Evil four again, but I mean, it was a really good, like it's
4721300	4722940	probably like the best Resident Evil game.
4722940	4723940	So Power Stone instead.
4723940	4724940	Yeah.
4724940	4725940	I'd like to see some Power Stone.
4725940	4729660	I'd even like take Tatsunoko versus Capcom, but I don't think that's going to happen.
4729660	4730660	Oh man.
4730660	4733180	I would love them to bring that out on, on the switch.
4733180	4735660	Now I'd imagine the licensing issues are gonna make that a challenge.
4735660	4738340	So I don't know about that, but you can still play that in some arcades.
4738340	4740660	I know round one in a Concord has it.
4740660	4742900	So I almost stopped at round one in San Jose.
4743100	4748300	I was so tempted, but I was like, I can't stand being in this car any longer than half
4748300	4749300	there.
4749300	4750300	And the kids have whined.
4750300	4751300	Yeah.
4751300	4752300	I play ticket games.
4752300	4753300	Yeah.
4753300	4754300	I'll play the crane.
4754300	4755300	I'll play dancer.
4755300	4757300	She doesn't want to play a game with the answer.
4757300	4758300	No ticket games.
4758300	4765860	It was like, uh, all right, uh, let's take a trip down memory lane to the classic game
4765860	4767260	of the week.
4767260	4770580	Not Power Stone tonight, but another goodie because every week dark soccer gets into the
4770580	4774340	gaming vault and usually we have to rely on radio magic to make it happen.
4774340	4779460	But she's here in person for this very special 750th episode of orange launch radio to pick
4779460	4784660	a game that she thinks, Hey, brats, you should be respecting this game.
4784660	4787420	And honestly though, this is a game everybody already respects.
4787420	4794100	I think like, I don't know people that don't not like this game unless they just dislike
4794100	4795100	this genre.
4795100	4797900	If they dislike this genre, then they probably don't care for this game.
4797900	4799740	But if you're into this genre, you like this game.
4799740	4801140	Anyway, I'll stop yapping.
4801140	4805840	What is the classic game of the week dark saga versus street fighter, which, no, I haven't
4805840	4806840	done it before.
4806840	4807840	I checked the Wiki.
4807840	4812940	So X-Men versus street fighter, um, it is a fighting game.
4812940	4821820	It is the big one that started the versus saga that came out in Japan in September 1996.
4821820	4828860	And um, it had several different home releases, the best of course being on the sake of Saturn.
4828860	4835500	Um, it basically had, it was actually, I kind of look at it as a direct result of X-Men
4835500	4837020	children of the Adam.
4837020	4841540	So it had the characters from X-Men battling street fighter characters.
4841540	4848860	Um, it was, uh, honestly a very unique game cause I mean you had, what else was the only
4848860	4851860	thing out like it at the time was king of fighters.
4851860	4857340	And, but this one was definitely like a combining of, of different genres.
4857340	4859340	It was pretty cool.
4859340	4865500	Um, it was pretty positively received and it also gave way to the sequel Marvel superheroes
4865500	4868460	versus street fighter that came out the next year.
4868460	4871660	So with this one, it is a 2D fighting game.
4871660	4873960	You have all kinds of different characters.
4873960	4879900	It is the first formal installment of the Marvel versus Capcom series.
4879900	4882380	So this, this isn't started the whole thing.
4882380	4886780	Um, you start off with, you know, each character has their own life gauge and you switch between
4886780	4891220	each character so that you can have some people refill their life bar in the back end.
4891220	4898060	Um, you know, you had assist moves and hyper combos and variable counters and fun stuff
4898060	4899620	like that.
4899620	4905900	Um, you also had, um, your arcade mode where you do a story against an AI and you have
4905900	4906900	your versus mode.
4906900	4913460	Um, if you do the story mode, then after you beat apocalypse, you actually fight your partner.
4913460	4915740	You're left with whoever you beat the boss with.
4915740	4920140	Um, and then you get an ending for that one.
4920140	4927740	So the characters that were in this one, um, were, uh, Cyclops, Gambit, Juggernaut, Magneto,
4927740	4930780	Rogue, Sabretooth, Storm and Wolverine.
4930780	4938100	And then for the, uh, street fighter characters, Akuma or Golki as he was in Japan, Kami, Charlie,
4938100	4946780	um, Chun-Li, Dalsim, Ken, Bison, oh well, or Balrog I guess as he was, uh, not Balrog.
4946780	4949780	Who was it?
4949780	4950780	Vega, that was it.
4950780	4951780	Vega.
4951780	4952780	They were all so many bad people.
4952780	4963020	Uh, Ryu and Zangief, so, um, the game was, uh, released on, uh, for CPS2 arcade board
4963020	4971260	and, um, it had a direct port to Sega Saturn that was, uh, released with the 4MB RAM cart.
4971260	4975060	This did not come out in the U.S. because they didn't know shit about marketing Saturn
4975060	4981300	in the U.S., um, but they were selling it at EB in the U.S.
4981300	4985420	Um, Sega had plans to release it in Europe, um, that had it bundled with the expansion
4985420	4989620	cartridges, but they eventually put that to the side.
4990220	4997300	I said, um, that it was going to be exclusive to the Saturn and then, um, because, uh, Capcom
4997300	5001300	was accused of favoritism to the Saturn, but even though the Saturn versions of Street
5001300	5008700	Fighter Alpha 2 were better and the home version of, uh, Night Warriors was a Saturn exclusive
5008700	5013460	as well, Capcom pulled back on that and said that they would do a PlayStation version,
5013460	5017540	which was, of course, nowhere near arcade perfect.
5017540	5021860	Um, it was pretty terrible, actually.
5021860	5027100	It was missing animation, it had no versus mode, um, you know, because of the memory
5027100	5034740	limitations of the, um, the PlayStation, of course, there was no real, like, supported
5034740	5037460	RAM, uh, cart, you know.
5037460	5041020	I was assuming that they would have something that would have fit into that I.O. port in
5041020	5046100	the back, but that never happened and, of course, you know that, um, later models never
5046140	5049140	had, they removed all those extra ports in the back.
5049140	5053140	Which, by the way, I found the first gen PlayStation at a first gen the other day.
5053140	5057140	I didn't get it because I already have, like, three of them.
5057140	5065020	Um, but the game was positively received, um, it was really fun except, of course, the
5065020	5071260	PlayStation 1 was pretty much, you know, kicked in the ass for being terrible, um, and then,
5071260	5075260	of course, it led to the sequel, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, which then led
5075260	5083260	to, you know, Marvel vs. Capcom series, Marvel vs. SNK, Capcom vs. SNK, Tatsu no Ko vs. Capcom.
5083260	5088940	We have more and more of these versus series, uh, coming out that just took everything we
5088940	5091460	loved and made it awesome.
5091460	5095260	Except for what the fuck is up with putting that comedian in Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street
5095260	5097260	Fighter, that's stupid.
5097260	5098260	Norimaru.
5098260	5099260	I'm done.
5100260	5105260	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, a classic fighter for sure.
5105260	5108260	X-Men vs. Street Fighter.
5108260	5112260	Good pick for a landmark episode of Orange Lounge Radio, good, uh, fighting game selection.
5112260	5113260	Yes.
5113260	5117260	Alright, we're gonna take a quick break, but when we come back, there is plenty more Orange
5117260	5120260	Lounge Radio to come, including more rapid fire news.
5120260	5124260	We're gonna get to, uh, your emails, or emails as the case may be, and we'll get to your
5124260	5127260	calls, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
5127260	5131260	When we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5137260	5141260	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight with episode number 750
5141260	5143260	of our show already in progress.
5143260	5147260	Um, I know you guys love all the Pokémon GO updates, but I do have to say, so during
5147260	5153260	the break, uh, I traded that unknown to Loki, and, uh, I said, just give me anything that
5153260	5156260	I won't be upset if it went lucky, and he gave me a Magikarp.
5156260	5157260	Guess what happened?
5157260	5158260	Lucky trade.
5158260	5159260	Of course, yeah.
5159260	5163260	So now I have a lucky Magikarp, which obviously will become a Gyarados when I have the candy,
5163260	5164260	and, um...
5164260	5166260	Apparently, Gastly's turned into Diddos now.
5166260	5167260	Oh, do, oh, can they?
5167260	5168260	Oh, is the one on my house a Ditto?
5168260	5169260	Yeah, the one is a Ditto, yeah.
5169260	5170260	Oh, funny.
5170260	5173260	And then, uh, but you got a lucky unknown, which not a lot of people have, so there you
5173260	5174260	go.
5174260	5175260	Yep.
5175260	5176260	That's fun.
5176260	5177260	Alright.
5177260	5180260	Anyway, uh, let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about, uh, some other quick
5180260	5184260	things that have been happening this week while Mr. Smoosh is screaming in the other
5184260	5189260	room, so I'm gonna see if some kibble will satiate his fat ass for a little while.
5189260	5190260	Loki.
5190260	5191260	Alright.
5191260	5192260	Just bring him to me.
5192260	5194260	I will comfort him.
5194260	5195260	Alright.
5195260	5202260	So, uh, Jade Raymond has left Electronic Arts, and she was, of course, the producer of the
5202260	5210260	Assassin's Creed series before moving to EA's Motive Studio, uh, about three years ago,
5210260	5217260	and, uh, she was originally gonna be overseeing a, I think it was that, uh, Star Wars, uh,
5217260	5222260	the single-player game, the kind of, uh, action-adventure game, but apparently they canceled that, so
5222260	5230260	now, um, Motive is working on a new IP in Star Wars, um, project, but she is no longer
5230260	5235260	gonna be working on that, because she has left the studio onto bigger and better things
5235260	5240260	than whatever EA can churn out for a Star Wars game.
5240260	5246260	Um, and then, of course, for you, Soul Calibur 6 players, they'd be happy to know that Nier
5246260	5254260	Automata's 2B is gonna be coming to Soul Calibur 6 as a, um, DLC character.
5254260	5256260	So, that's pretty awesome.
5256260	5257260	Alright.
5257260	5262260	Uh, last week on the show, we spent some time talking about the Intellivision Amico, and
5262260	5266260	we had mentioned that more information would be coming out on the Monday following our
5266260	5267260	show, and that did happen.
5267260	5270260	They did end up having a trailer, uh, that came out.
5270260	5274260	Um, most of the trailer kind of recap things we already had known about, uh, although you
5274260	5278260	did get to see some of the personalities that would be involved with the Intellivision.
5278260	5279260	A lot of people.
5279260	5280260	I didn't realize how many.
5280260	5283260	Yeah, which the one that struck me as funny, which obviously, you know, going back way
5283260	5289260	back throwback to our DDR days, but the guy that was, like, big with DDR's relations,
5289260	5293260	I think it was, like, PR relations, and I don't remember what his official title was,
5293260	5296260	but Jason Enos was kind of, out of Konami, he was, like, kind of like the face of DDR
5296260	5300260	a little bit for a while, and he's going to be, it sounds like, what, like second in command
5300260	5302260	on this Intellivision thing, isn't he?
5302260	5306260	Yeah, and I remember, what was it, Dave Perry with, was it Shiny?
5306260	5312260	He was in there as well, so, I mean, lots of people that are on board with this thing,
5312260	5313260	so it has potential.
5313260	5315260	I'm curious to see what happens with it.
5315260	5319260	And Perrin Kaplan, who I think was involved with Nintendo for a short while, unfortunately,
5319260	5324260	I think she was there during that whole Wii Vitality sensor debacle, but, not everything's
5324260	5326260	a hit, it happens.
5326260	5331260	So, anyway, Loki, would you mind grabbing this other thing I had, because unfortunately
5331260	5334260	I'm not able to pull it up on this computer, it's having a problem.
5334260	5335260	Oh, darn, that Windows XP.
5335260	5339260	I know, right, but I know it has to do with Capcom's beat-em-up bundle, and it's getting
5339260	5340260	a new patch that's coming out.
5340260	5346260	Yeah, it's because their beat-em-up bundle was absolute dog shit on, I think it was PC,
5346260	5348260	but apparently that's not the issue.
5348260	5352260	It says they're going to be getting a patch that's coming in November, and it's going
5352260	5356260	to be adding new screen filters, a new screen size, an option to turn off the ability for
5356260	5358260	other players to join in-game sessions online.
5358260	5363260	I guess that has nothing to do with just the absolute lag and bullshit that was in, I think,
5363260	5366260	the PC version, or maybe in the Switch version.
5366260	5370260	I just remember watching a video of it where it was stuttering like fucking crazy.
5370260	5372260	But that's cool that they're supporting their games.
5372260	5378260	Hopefully whatever that issue was and whatever version it was that I saw a video of is fixed.
5378260	5382260	Alright, and Dark Sakura has a few stories for us before we get to releases around the
5382260	5383260	world.
5383260	5384260	Ah, I do.
5384260	5387260	Well, if I can make the words come out of my mouth.
5387260	5394260	The next Splatfest in Japan, or Splatoon 2 Splatfest, I should say, is about Poki, as
5394260	5396260	in the confection.
5396260	5403260	There is regular Poki, and there is Poki Extremely Thins, which are about the girth of a spaghetti
5403260	5404260	strand.
5404260	5407260	And some of us, you've probably heard it pronounced Poki.
5407260	5409260	Some people pronounce it like that.
5409260	5411260	Yeah, because I think of Poki as in like raw fish.
5411260	5413260	I think of the fish thing, yeah.
5413260	5414260	That's Poki.
5414260	5416260	I know, I know.
5416260	5417260	But you know how we-
5417260	5420260	But I'm a dumb American, so I don't understand the difference.
5420260	5421260	Y'all need to speak American.
5422260	5425260	Can I make spaghetti out of the Poki or whatever?
5428260	5430260	Maybe Sp-Sp-Poki?
5430260	5434260	So also, Team Sonic Racing has been delayed until next year.
5434260	5439260	It's been pushed back to May 21st, 2019, and no one curr.
5439260	5445260	I hope it's only to get the guy that did the theme song for Daytona to do the theme song
5445260	5446260	for this game.
5446260	5448260	I hope it's to get Danica Patrick back.
5448260	5450260	Well, let's see, why not both?
5450260	5453260	I really, actually, it's funny, have you ever watched that guy sing?
5453260	5454260	Yeah.
5454260	5458260	He's absolutely engaging to watch.
5458260	5462260	Even like studio stuff, he's like, I'm totally into Brew Brew Sky.
5462260	5463260	That's right.
5463260	5464260	And he sang Burning Rangers.
5464260	5468260	He had, didn't he team up for like F-Zero song?
5468260	5469260	Yes, yes.
5469260	5471260	I was like, he was just recently, we were talking about that guy.
5471260	5473260	Yes, everything he touches is magic.
5473260	5474260	Yeah.
5474260	5478260	And SSG100Matt in our chat at live.vognetwork.com wants to point out, I care, Sonic All-Star
5478260	5479260	Racing was great.
5479260	5483260	I care too, but you know, you want it to be a good game.
5483260	5486260	Every little thing he sings is magic.
5486260	5487260	Right.
5487260	5490260	Let's travel around the world and check out some upcoming releases.
5490260	5493260	What you'll be buying a little sooner than Team Sonic Racing.
5493260	5494260	Yes.
5494260	5500260	Call of Cthulhu, the official video game endorsed directly by Cthulhu himself.
5501260	5504260	Coming on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5504260	5509260	Dream Daddy, Dadrector's Cut on PS4.
5509260	5510260	Which I still have never played.
5510260	5511260	Is that weird?
5511260	5513260	I just haven't gotten around to that.
5513260	5515260	Especially since you've cosplayed.
5515260	5516260	I know, right?
5516260	5517260	You haven't played the game yet.
5517260	5518260	Sorry to let you all down.
5518260	5521260	I'm a fake, fake gamer boy.
5521260	5523260	Fake gamer boy.
5523260	5525260	Galmetal on the Switch.
5525260	5529260	Lego Harry Potter collection on the Switch and Xbox One.
5529260	5533260	Mutant Football League Dynasty Edition on the Switch.

5546260	5549260	Steven Universe Save the Light on the Switch.
5549260	5552260	This one should be a little bit up Rob's alley.
5552260	5555260	Diablo 3 The Eternal collection on the Switch this week.
5555260	5557260	Yeah, I kind of want to get it.
5557260	5561260	It's money, it's money, but I'm probably going to end up getting that anyway.
5561260	5563260	And then for you music game fans,
5563260	5567260	Taiko no Tatujin Drum and Fun on the Switch.
5567260	5568260	And if you don't have a Switch,
5568260	5572260	Taiko no Tatujin Drum Session on PlayStation 4.
5572260	5573260	That's it.
5573260	5574260	Nice.
5574260	5576260	Japan feels a little light this week.
5576260	5579260	I'm not seeing huge releases, at least not on PlayStation 4.
5579260	5582260	Transference is the only really big release from Ubisoft
5582260	5585260	on November 1st this week on the PlayStation 4.
5585260	5588260	Over on the Nintendo Switch,
5588260	5591260	I don't think I see anything big over there either actually.
5591260	5594260	Niko Tomo is the only game that I see on the Switch this week.
5594260	5596260	So it seems to be a quiet week on the Switch,
5596260	5598260	or excuse me, a quiet week in Japan for whatever reason.
5598260	5600260	Dark Sakura.
5600260	5602260	It's busy over in Europe.
5602260	5605260	So starting with the 30th,
5605260	5607260	we have Fallout 76 Beta.
5607260	5611260	We have Call of Cthulhu for PlayStation and Xbox.
5611260	5614260	Steep X Games Gold Edition.
5614260	5619260	We have Sports Party The Escapist 2 for Switch.
5619260	5622260	8 To Glory Bull Riding.

5623260	5626260	Gungrave VR Loaded Coffin Edition.
5626260	5628260	That's on the 31st.
5628260	5634260	Galmetal World Tour Edition on the 31st on Switch.
5634260	5637260	It looks like on November 2nd,
5637260	5642260	we have Football Manager 2019.
5642260	5645260	We have Mutant Football League Dynasty Edition.
5645260	5648260	Steven Universe Double Pack.
5648260	5651260	Looks like Diablo 3 The Eternal Collection.
5651260	5654260	Taiko no Tatsujin Drum and Fun.
5654260	5656260	Jeez, Mushi.
5656260	5658260	This was all during the show last week,
5658260	5660260	so you just have to get used to it.
5660260	5663260	Lego Harry Potter Collection for Xbox and Switch.
5663260	5666260	Witcher 3 Dark Souls 3 Bundle.
5666260	5667260	God, there's a bunch on this.
5667260	5668260	Okay, here's the last one.
5668260	5670260	And Gem Smashers.
5670260	5671260	There you go.
5671260	5673260	All right.
5673260	5674260	Well, let's move on.
5674260	5675260	You know, everything I read about the cat meowing
5675260	5677260	says you can't acknowledge it,
5677260	5680260	because then it just teaches them that it works.
5680260	5681260	It'll make it worse, yeah.
5681260	5682260	It works, yeah.
5682260	5685260	So, sucks, huh?
5685260	5687260	I just feed Midna and she shuts up.
5687260	5689260	No, I just fed this one.
5689260	5690260	Anyway.
5690260	5692260	I don't know, usually I just get Midna in my lap
5692260	5693260	and she shuts up.
5693260	5696260	SSG100Matt says Mr. Smoosh wants to do release dates.
5696260	5697260	Maybe that's what it is.
5697260	5698260	Maybe Mr. Smoosh is coming for your...
5698260	5700260	He's gonna release his poop.
5700260	5703260	As long as he does it in the litter box, fine.
5703260	5705260	SSG100Matt suggests that Mr. Smoosh
5705260	5708260	gets Australian release dates.
5708260	5711260	That might not be a bad idea.
5711260	5712260	Coming out this week.
5712260	5713260	Meow.
5713260	5714260	And meow.
5714260	5715260	Oh, good.
5715260	5717260	Other dad is home and can hopefully take care
5717260	5720260	of Mr. Smoosh's insensitive meowing.
5720260	5721260	All right, anyway.
5721260	5722260	He's singing us the song of his people.
5722260	5723260	That's right.
5723260	5724260	All right.
5724260	5725260	Let's move on to the mailbag,
5725260	5727260	because every week you guys send us e-mails
5727260	5729260	to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5729260	5732260	I'm quite pleased with how clean the mailbox was.
5732260	5733260	Yes.
5733260	5735260	I... because I knew you would bellyache
5735260	5737260	if I didn't move everything to trash.
5737260	5738260	Meow.
5738260	5739260	Meow.
5739260	5740260	Exactly.
5740260	5741260	Meow.
5741260	5742260	Meow.
5742260	5743260	See, I speak Smoosh.
5743260	5745260	Uh, Darce Acro, what is in the mailbag?
5745260	5747260	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
5747260	5748260	is the e-mail address.
5748260	5750260	From our own Raginator.
5750260	5751260	Hi, everyone.
5751260	5752260	As opposed to someone else's.
5752260	5753260	Someone else's Raginator.
5753260	5754260	Sorry, Raginator.
5754260	5755260	We're giving you to someone else.
5755260	5756260	You can't be ours anymore.
5756260	5757260	Kidding.
5757260	5758260	Hi, everyone.
5758260	5760260	Just writing this very last second e-mail
5760260	5762260	to pose a long-winded question
5762260	5764260	that is arising from a shitstorm
5764260	5766260	that occurred this weekend.
5766260	5768260	I'm trying to help someone come up with ideas
5768260	5770260	for a video streaming service.
5770260	5772260	She does cosplay for cons and photoshoots.
5772260	5773260	Twitch is out.
5773260	5776260	Um, skipping, skipping, skipping.
5776260	5779260	Um, she ruled out YouTube,
5779260	5781260	saying that their streaming is shit.
5781260	5785260	Uh, Mixer, from what I've been told, has issues.
5785260	5787260	That being said, can you think of any alternatives?
5787260	5790260	If need be, we can discuss this more off-air
5790260	5792260	if you need more info or details.
5792260	5794260	Normally, I would just close an e-mail
5794260	5795260	with my brand of humor,
5795260	5796260	but this time, I'll skip the humor
5796260	5797260	and just say this.
5797260	5799260	Slash kitty, you have my full support,
5799260	5801260	and I will do what I can to help.
5801260	5804260	Um, doesn't Vimeo do, like, streaming, too?
5804260	5805260	Yes.
5805260	5808260	And first off, in response to talking about it off-air,
5808260	5810260	there's only gonna be, like, two people to get this joke,
5810260	5812260	but, Raginator, nothing you ask matters
5812260	5814260	unless that audio is rolling.
5814260	5815260	You get the joke, Jamie?
5815260	5817260	All right, anyway, it's a Drag Race reference.
5817260	5820260	Anyway, um, I know, Loki, you're not supposed to get it.
5820260	5823260	All right, anyway, uh, in all seriousness,
5823260	5826260	uh, yeah, Vimeo, I guess, is one.
5826260	5828260	I mean, gosh, cutting yourself out of YouTube,
5828260	5830260	that is a big chunk of it.
5830260	5834260	Um, here's, I mean,
5834260	5836260	I'm gonna give you an honest answer,
5836260	5838260	and I'm not saying this to sound, like, skeezy
5838260	5841260	or anything like that, but OnlyFans,
5842260	5844260	and I realize that is a usually thing
5844260	5846260	associated with pornography.
5846260	5848260	I'm bringing it up because I'm not gonna shame sex workers.
5848260	5850260	I don't know if that is anything at all remotely
5850260	5852260	that the person is interested in,
5852260	5854260	but it doesn't have to be that.
5854260	5856260	So, like, I know a podcast I listen to
5856260	5859260	is kinda half talking about doing something with OnlyFans,
5859260	5861260	so, I mean, just, I just thrown it out there as an option.
5861260	5863260	It is an option.
5863260	5866260	Um, maybe, doesn't Patreon allow you
5866260	5869260	to unlock video stuff on there?
5869260	5871260	But I don't think it's streaming.
5871260	5874260	Oh, I thought they had, like, a built-in VOD thing,
5874260	5876260	but you had to, like, actually pay for the Patreon
5876260	5877260	in order to see it.
5877260	5879260	I don't know, I'm not gonna really use it.
5879260	5881260	Wait, what are we, streaming adult content?
5881260	5883260	No, no, no, no, no, I, no, just, like,
5883260	5885260	not necessarily.
5885260	5887260	My answer kinda got into that
5887260	5889260	because if that's something somebody wants to do,
5889260	5892260	then go for it, but I don't think it was specifically that.
5892260	5894260	I think it was just cosplay, featuring,
5894260	5896260	and things like that.
5896260	5898260	I mean, if it were me doing that,
5898260	5901260	I wouldn't stream cosplay stuff at all.
5901260	5905260	I would do more of the Instagram route.
5905260	5906260	I don't know.
5906260	5908260	Oh, Instagram's a great idea, actually.
5908260	5909260	But you can do video,
5909260	5912260	and you can do live stuff on Instagram and Facebook.
5912260	5914260	And they have that new Instagram TV thing, too.
5914260	5915260	So, there's that.
5915260	5917260	Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.
5917260	5918260	Good suggestion.
5918260	5920260	Um, and then also, uh, D'Artezia suggests
5920260	5922260	is Ustream still around?
5922260	5924260	I thought maybe it was, like,
5924260	5926260	I thought maybe it shut down at some point.
5926260	5928260	I think they're still there because of, uh,
5928260	5931260	the PlayStation will still let you stream there, won't it?
5931260	5932260	And that would be,
5932260	5935260	Dailymotion would be, uh, part of that as well.
5935260	5936260	So, I think, uh,
5936260	5939260	the PlayStation 4 officially supports all those, uh, platforms,
5939260	5941260	even though they're not as common.
5941260	5943260	And I don't know, like, as far as what,
5943260	5946260	what type of, like, account, like,
5946260	5949260	you know, what offerings you're talking about here,
5949260	5952260	but, like, I know there's, like, subreddits and stuff
5952260	5954260	where people offer stuff like that,
5954260	5957260	and, like, photos and, you know, stuff where they can sell.
5957260	5959260	And I don't know what services they use,
5959260	5960260	but you can always see,
5960260	5962260	hey, what are you using for your shit?
5962260	5964260	And use the same thing.
5964260	5966260	Yeah, I think Instagram was really the best suggestion
5966260	5968260	because, um, I know Aria Snark,
5968260	5970260	who does a lot of cosplay that was hosting
5970260	5972260	Shaking and Crying with Me for a while.
5972260	5974260	She's been building and building on Instagram
5974260	5975260	and doing very well.
5975260	5977260	There's a few other cosplayers that I follow.
5977260	5979260	Um, in fact, I'm, you know,
5979260	5981260	as soon as I get back to learning my DMs,
5981260	5983260	learning my damn sewing machine,
5983260	5985260	my own cosplay is gonna be going up there
5985260	5987260	under its own account, which, by the way,
5987260	5989260	you can follow me on Instagram as DarkSakura.
5989260	5991260	You can follow Midna as Batittles.
5991260	5993260	Uh, TigerClaw says Ustream is around,
5993260	5995260	but it's no longer called Ustream.
5995260	5997260	It's IBM Cloud Video.
5997260	5999260	IBM's buying all this shit, aren't they?
5999260	6001260	They just bought Red Hat, too.
6001260	6003260	There you go. Microsoft just acquired GitHub.
6003260	6005260	Everything, everything's been bought.
6005260	6007260	Did you know that DreamWorks used to do all of their, um,
6007260	6010260	proprietary rendering software in, um, Red Hat?
6010260	6012260	I know now.
6012260	6014260	I got to speak with somebody who graduated from my college
6014260	6016260	and went on to work for DreamWorks
6016260	6018260	and worked on the Sherman and Peabody movie.
6018260	6020260	Oh. And I asked them about their rendering software.
6020260	6022260	He's like, yeah, it all runs in Red Hat, and it's proprietary.
6022260	6024260	Huh. Cool. How about that?
6024260	6025260	You learn something every day.
6025260	6026260	All right, if that's it for emails,
6026260	6028260	I'll encourage you to send more emails.
6028260	6030260	Participate at orangelandtrader.com
6030260	6032260	is the place to send emails in the future.
6032260	6034260	In the meantime, we've got some more news stories
6034260	6037260	for you guys, and we'll get to our Skype line eventually.
6037260	6039260	Loki, what do you have for us?
6039260	6041260	Well, VR's canceled.
6041260	6043260	No, just kidding.
6043260	6045260	Um, so apparently the, um,
6045260	6050260	there is rumors that the Rift 2 is canceled,
6050260	6052260	and apparently the co-founder of Oculus
6052260	6055260	has left the company as well.
6055260	6057260	Now, what this would necessarily mean
6057260	6059260	is not necessarily that they're gonna stop
6059260	6061260	development of the Oculus Rift.
6061260	6064260	It's just that what was currently the Rift 2
6064260	6066260	is now not being worked on,
6066260	6068260	and I'm probably in part with the fact
6068260	6071260	that they've done stuff like, so the Oculus, um,
6071260	6072260	what the hell was the last Oculus
6072260	6074260	that they put out, the standalone one?
6074260	6075260	I don't remember what the fuck it's called.
6075260	6078260	But, um, they have other Oculus products
6078260	6080260	that are gonna be available instead.
6080260	6083260	So, um, Michael Abrash basically said that,
6083260	6086260	you know, these are the good, these are the good old days,
6086260	6090260	um, when they're talking about, like, you know,
6090260	6093260	as far as how VR has come along.
6093260	6096260	Um, but now, of course, you know, with that,
6096260	6099260	they're gonna be pushing for new hardware,
6099260	6101260	maybe going in even a different direction
6101260	6103260	with stuff like that, you know, um,
6103260	6106260	the brand new Oculus headset that they have as standalone.
6106260	6108260	I'm curious to see, like, what's gonna run on that,
6108260	6109260	because I know they have, like,
6109260	6111260	was it the whole Vader thing,
6111260	6114260	but, like, what else can it do?
6114260	6117260	Is it, how is this gonna, like, tie in with Facebook again,
6117260	6119260	you know, with, are they gonna be doing, like,
6119260	6121260	you know, some sort of VR Facebook crap on there?
6121260	6123260	I don't know if this is directly related,
6123260	6125260	but I will say one thing that I've been saying
6125260	6127260	and the one thing that I've been super into
6127260	6129260	that I think is neat on Facebook lately,
6129260	6131260	and I know Dark Soccer's feeling this too,
6131260	6134260	is that they just enabled those 3D photos,
6134260	6138260	and if you have a phone that has basically two lenses,
6138260	6142260	so I know any iPhone, uh, past seven will do it,
6142260	6146260	because if your phone can do the portrait thing on iPhone,
6146260	6147260	I don't know what the Android equivalent is,
6147260	6149260	but it's just, like, basically just two,
6149260	6150260	it has to have, like, one camera
6150260	6152260	and a depth perception lens as well.
6152260	6154260	It's called the knockoff.
6154260	6155260	Yeah, well, you know.
6155260	6158260	Um, but anyway, as long as your phone has that
6158260	6159260	and that data's in the picture,
6159260	6162260	you can post these 3D pictures to Facebook.
6162260	6163260	They're weird, though.
6163260	6164260	Yeah, they're kinda trippy.
6164260	6167260	But it, did you see the one I did of my, uh, tea mug?
6167260	6168260	I don't think I saw that one.
6168260	6169260	Yeah, it kinda got jacked up on that.
6169260	6172260	Yeah, the, basically, because it's clear glass
6172260	6176260	and the top part of the mug ended up foreground,
6176260	6177260	and then, of the handle,
6177260	6179260	and then the bottom half that was lighter
6179260	6182260	ended up as background, so it's, like, it's split apart.
6182260	6183260	Okay, that's trippy.
6183260	6184260	Let me really quickly read the whole excerpt
6184260	6186260	that he put in his Facebook post.
6186260	6187260	So, so much has happened since the day
6187260	6190260	we found out Oculus in 2012, or July 2012.
6190260	6193260	I never could have imagined how much we would accomplish
6193260	6194260	and how far we would come,
6194260	6197260	and now, after six incredible years, I am moving on.
6197260	6198260	I am deeply proud and grateful
6198260	6200260	for all that we have done together.
6200260	6201260	We have assembled one of the greatest
6201260	6203260	research and engineering teams in history,
6203260	6206260	delivered the first step of true virtual presence
6206260	6208260	with Oculus Rift in touch,
6208260	6210260	and inspired an entirely new industry.
6210260	6213260	We started a revolution that will change the world
6213260	6215260	in ways we can only envision.
6215260	6219260	Yet, as far as we've come, the journey has just begun.
6219260	6223260	You know, basically talking about the good old days.
6223260	6225260	And then, now, when we pioneer the foundation
6225260	6228260	for the next great computing platform and medium,
6228260	6230260	this is our time to be pushing state-of-the-art
6230260	6231260	onward and upward.
6231260	6234260	Every part of AR, VR needs to improve,
6234260	6236260	especially the hardware and core technology.
6236260	6239260	So, I think it sounds to me like the frustration
6239260	6242260	may have been that, you know, now we have this,
6242260	6244260	I don't know, maybe the standalone software.
6244260	6245260	I think he's expecting more.
6245260	6248260	Maybe we're just not pushing it enough.
6248260	6249260	But I still think they need to get
6249260	6250260	the kind of saturation out there first
6250260	6252260	before we're really pushing the technology,
6252260	6254260	but maybe doing both at the same time.
6254260	6255260	Yeah.
6255260	6256260	Because how do you make it affordable
6256260	6258260	and entry-level for people to get into it,
6258260	6261260	to get wanting more as far out of the hardware and everything?
6261260	6262260	Right.
6262260	6263260	I don't know.
6263260	6264260	And, obviously, Facebook acquiring this
6264260	6267260	was never really about only games.
6267260	6268260	Although, you know, it's interesting
6268260	6270260	talking about kind of like other moves
6270260	6273260	that Facebook makes and how it might relate to this
6273260	6274260	because, you know, we just talked about
6274260	6276260	the 3D pictures thing and how, actually,
6276260	6278260	I find that stuff to be really fascinating.
6278260	6280260	I mean, it's still got issues,
6280260	6282260	like Darcy points out with her tea mug picture,
6282260	6284260	but, like, the picture I posted of, like,
6284260	6287260	Mr. Smoosh lying down in 3D got, like, a ton of feedback
6287260	6289260	because people were like, that is so cool.
6289260	6291260	And, like, it was just a normal picture
6291260	6293260	I took in portrait mode because you can go back
6293260	6295260	to any picture in your library that you took in the past
6295260	6297260	in portrait mode and it'll run its filter on it,
6297260	6298260	which is really cool.
6298260	6302260	So, anyway, you know, but I noticed one thing,
6302260	6303260	and this is annoying me about Facebook,
6303260	6305260	is that now, like, every time I open up
6305260	6307260	Facebook on my phone, the games thing lights up
6307260	6310260	with, like, you have one notification in games.
6310260	6311260	You have this in games.
6311260	6312260	It's like, I don't, like, I really wish
6312260	6314260	I could just, like, get rid of that or uninstall it
6314260	6316260	because I'm not interested in doing games.
6316260	6320260	It's going back to the whole, remember when people
6320260	6322260	get super fucking annoyed at this on Facebook
6322260	6325260	when it's like a friend has sent you something in Farmville.
6325260	6326260	A friend needs you to get their farm
6326260	6328260	in Farmville, so you get, like, 20 of those requests.
6328260	6329260	Yeah, I remember blocking all that shit.
6329260	6332260	Like, I feel like Facebook is, like, coming back to that,
6332260	6334260	but it's Facebook's own shit where it's like
6334260	6336260	you have a post in a new gaming community.
6336260	6337260	No, I get that all the time and, like,
6337260	6339260	I've turned off notifications for most everything.
6339260	6342260	I don't need to know when someone's posted a picture
6342260	6343260	or something like that unless I'm, like,
6343260	6346260	specifically choosing to be notified by that,
6346260	6348260	but they keep doing that.
6348260	6349260	Like, oh, you have a notification.
6349260	6351260	It's like, oh, such and such has posted something
6351260	6352260	on their Instagram feed.
6352260	6354260	I don't fucking care about Instagram.
6354260	6355260	I'm on Facebook.
6355260	6357260	I don't give a shit about that.
6357260	6359260	Or I, this person's posted a photo
6359260	6362260	or this person's posted a comment or, like, an update.
6362260	6364260	Who cares?
6364260	6365260	I don't care.
6365260	6367260	If I wanted to be notified by that,
6367260	6372260	I would set my notifications to be like that.
6372260	6374260	All right, yeah, I just, that's the type of crap
6374260	6376260	that's gonna just annoy me with Facebook
6376260	6378260	and make me just uninstall it for my phone again,
6378260	6380260	but it's like, it's a double-edged sword
6380260	6382260	because, you know, where else am I gonna show people
6382260	6384260	the picture of me dressed up as sexy?
6384260	6386260	Which was my Halloween costume, by the way,
6386260	6387260	if you weren't already aware.
6387260	6388260	So, and then, of course, to go back to...
6388260	6390260	Where's your Miss Peacock shoes?
6390260	6391260	They were my Miss Peacock shoes.
6391260	6393260	If I'm gonna, girl, if I'm gonna spend $40
6393260	6394260	on a pair of heels,
6394260	6395260	you know I'm gonna wear them more than once.
6395260	6397260	So, to go back to the article real quick.
6397260	6399260	So, the actual reason that he left is,
6399260	6401260	basically, he had fundamentally different views
6401260	6404260	of the future of Oculus that grew deeper over time
6404260	6407260	and wasn't interested in the race to the bottom.
6407260	6409260	So, it sounds like, you know,
6409260	6412260	maybe the race to make it cheaper, more affordable.
6412260	6413260	I don't know.
6413260	6415260	He wants to really push the VR hardware,
6415260	6418260	which, you know, I'm kind of on board with that.
6418260	6420260	But, at the same time, I understand why they have to
6420260	6422260	because you gotta get people interested in it
6422260	6425260	in order to push this high-end hardware.
6425260	6426260	Yeah.
6426260	6427260	All right.
6427260	6430260	Well, we'll see what the future is gonna hold for this.
6430260	6433260	I don't think, necessarily, that, you know,
6433260	6435260	Facebook is just, like, totally getting out of VR,
6435260	6437260	but maybe it's not gonna be, like, kind of like,
6437260	6441260	it's, like, not necessarily a race to outdo Vive
6441260	6444260	and PlayStation VR, which are starting to cement themselves
6444260	6445260	as more like the gaming options.
6445260	6447260	I really wish PlayStation would come out with some new
6447260	6449260	goddamn, like, controllers for that shit
6449260	6451260	because those move controllers are...
6451260	6454260	I would assume, and it's the biggest assumption,
6454260	6456260	but I would assume any of that type of stuff
6456260	6458260	is being rolled over to PlayStation 5
6458260	6461260	and how VR might work with PlayStation 5 at this point.
6461260	6464260	So, speaking of PlayStation VR...
6464260	6466260	I have not played it yet.
6466260	6468260	Shame on you!
6468260	6469260	I just...
6469260	6470260	Shame!
6470260	6472260	Ding, ding, ding, ding.
6472260	6474260	We're, what, two weeks out from Tetris Effect?
6474260	6475260	Yes.
6475260	6476260	So, it's gonna happen.
6476260	6478260	So, I am excited.
6478260	6481260	I actually was listening to the soundtrack of Tetris Effect
6481260	6482260	the other day.
6482260	6483260	It's so good.
6483260	6484260	Oh, yeah, they have a soundtrack online?
6484260	6486260	Yeah, because if you pre-order it, you get the soundtrack.
6486260	6487260	And somebody put it all on YouTube.
6487260	6488260	It's great.
6488260	6489260	I do need to pre-order and get the soundtrack.
6489260	6490260	Yeah, it's great.
6490260	6491260	All right.
6491260	6493260	Let's get into some stories on Pokemon Go.
6493260	6495260	The first story, which I know you guys love it
6495260	6497260	when we talk about it, but, you know,
6497260	6499260	it's kind of a big deal,
6499260	6501260	and this one was something Loki kind of referenced
6501260	6505260	a little bit ago, is that Niantic is going to be
6505260	6507260	unveiling an adventure sink.
6507260	6509260	They're calling it a Niantic real-world platform
6509260	6511260	gameplay system that gives players
6511260	6513260	more reason to go outside.
6513260	6516260	So, basically, what you're gonna be doing with this
6516260	6518260	is that it will kind of tie together
6518260	6522260	with the health monitors in your phone, I guess,
6522260	6525260	to actually give you credit for walking eggs
6525260	6527260	and things of that sort,
6527260	6531260	which is something that you get the credit
6531260	6533260	for the egg walking and all that,
6533260	6535260	but it's tied into the health apps
6535260	6536260	that are already on your phone.
6536260	6538260	Well, yeah, and I saw that, and I hope that's the case
6538260	6540260	because I use those.
6540260	6541260	I don't know.
6541260	6545260	I think it was just a Samsung Fit or the Android Fit.
6545260	6548260	It's Android Google Fit, and it's iOS Health Kit.
6548260	6550260	All of my stuff ties into my health app.
6550260	6551260	Right, and that's just the watch.
6551260	6553260	I don't know if I used Android Fit.
6553260	6554260	I used the Fitbit stuff.
6554260	6555260	I think that ties in with Android.
6555260	6556260	I'm sure it does.
6556260	6557260	It should, but I don't know if there are issues.
6557260	6560260	Now Pokemon goes working again on the Apple Watch.
6560260	6561260	Oh, does the Apple Watch?
6561260	6563260	The Apple Watch thing has never worked for me.
6563260	6565260	It's been pretty okay.
6565260	6567260	I don't need it because I have the Gotcha,
6567260	6569260	but I do like that the watch...
6569260	6571260	But I like this for tracking my walking.
6571260	6572260	Yeah, the watch tracks your...
6572260	6575260	You know what's funny is that before I got the watch,
6575260	6576260	I was very much like, I don't need an Apple Watch.
6576260	6577260	I don't do any of that stuff,
6577260	6579260	but then the exercise stuff kind of pulled me in,
6579260	6581260	and I really do like that it shows me,
6581260	6583260	like, oh, this is how much you've moved today.
6583260	6585260	Get up off your butt and do some walking
6585260	6586260	because you haven't really done any.
6586260	6587260	Mine reminds me to stand up
6587260	6589260	instead of just getting so locked up in my work.
6589260	6590260	Yeah, and...
6590260	6591260	But now you know why I stand up
6591260	6592260	like every hour during the show.
6592260	6593260	Oh, for sure. No, because I...
6593260	6595260	Well, I'd already hit my 12 hours before
6595260	6596260	because I don't...
6596260	6598260	My phone stops reminding me after 12 hours.
6598260	6600260	It doesn't remind me anymore.
6600260	6602260	Yeah, mine goes from about nine to six.
6602260	6603260	It will stop.
6603260	6606260	But then, you know, the other thing, though,
6606260	6609260	is that I'm also doing this mindfulness challenge at work
6609260	6613260	where I think, like, the goal is to, like, do, like...
6613260	6616260	What is it? 25 days at minimum?
6616260	6617260	Mm-hmm.
6617260	6620260	To do the meditation for 10 minutes,
6620260	6621260	the breathing, the mindful breathing.
6621260	6622260	Yeah.
6622260	6624260	And I've done every day this month.
6624260	6625260	That's great.
6625260	6627260	Now, supposedly, this feature
6627260	6629260	is also going to let you have challenges,
6629260	6631260	kind of work with friends.
6631260	6633260	There's going to be more stuff in the game,
6633260	6635260	so it isn't enabled in the game yet.
6635260	6638260	So as Joe and Hunter Matt in chat asks,
6638260	6639260	so in order for this to work,
6639260	6642260	you need to have background data enabled on Pokemon Go.
6642260	6643260	If it's going through other apps,
6643260	6644260	I wonder if it does anymore.
6644260	6646260	I don't think it does.
6646260	6647260	Unfortunately, we're just not going to have
6647260	6649260	a lot of answers to these questions
6649260	6650260	until the feature comes out
6650260	6653260	and those people on Silf Road tear it apart
6653260	6654260	in five minutes.
6654260	6655260	I don't think it's going to have background data.
6655260	6656260	It's probably going to be just,
6656260	6658260	okay, you launch this app,
6658260	6660260	or the last time you launched this app was here,
6660260	6663260	and how many steps or whatever distance you've covered
6663260	6664260	between them.
6664260	6665260	And it's going to pull that from the health app.
6665260	6669260	It's just like, yeah, it's like I use my fitness coach
6669260	6670260	for logging my food,
6670260	6672260	and I use my Fitbit app for everything else,
6672260	6673260	for activity-wise.
6673260	6675260	I kind of separate them that way.
6675260	6676260	I don't know why.
6676260	6677260	I just do it that way.
6677260	6680260	Now, Rama's trying to give you some Android advice,
6680260	6682260	because DarkStalker and I can't really help there.
6682260	6684260	Rama in chat says you have to open the Google Fit app
6684260	6686260	and have it sync the Fitbit app.
6686260	6689260	Yeah, I was just about to download it,
6689260	6691260	because I don't have it installed on my phone.
6691260	6692260	Get on that.
6692260	6694260	Hatch them eggs.
6694260	6697260	But I have so many fitness trackers.
6697260	6699260	Niantic will just sell more incubators
6699260	6701260	so they're all about this, I'm sure.
6701260	6704260	But I imagine this feature will probably be unlocked
6704260	6705260	at some point in the next week.
6705260	6707260	I don't know if they're going to make us wait
6707260	6708260	all the way until the Halloween event is over,
6708260	6710260	but we shall see.
6710260	6713260	So lots of news around Pokémon GO right now.
6713260	6715260	Not all of it good, right, DarkStalker?
6715260	6717260	Fuck that.
6717260	6720260	Yeah, so Niantic posted on their Twitter,
6720260	6724260	Trainers in Arizona come join the Autism Speaks Walk
6724260	6728260	on October 28th and raise money for SARRC,
6728260	6730260	which provides research, treatment, education,
6730260	6732260	and community outreach for people with autism.
6732260	6734260	First of all, fuck Autism Speaks.
6734260	6736260	Fuck them, fuck them, fuck them.
6736260	6739260	It wasn't until this year that they finally got
6739260	6741260	an autistic person on their board.
6741260	6745260	They spent decades sharing misinformation
6745260	6747260	and treating us like we have a disease,
6747260	6750260	instead of this just being how our brains are wired.
6750260	6757260	They advocate the ADA, which is like this behavioral therapy.
6757260	6758260	ABA.
6758260	6759260	ABA, sorry.
6759260	6761260	It's this behavioral therapy that, in some cases,
6761260	6765260	have been borderline abusive to kids.
6765260	6768260	I'm sure there are some places that do it better,
6768260	6771260	but a lot of times I will just see, like,
6771260	6773260	completely outrageous things that are done against children.
6773260	6775260	And then they, you know, started putting out
6775260	6780260	all of these videos and this propaganda, really,
6780260	6783260	that were saying that people with autism
6783260	6786260	are a danger to their parents and a burden
6786260	6788260	and that we need to be, quote, cured.
6788260	6791260	Fuck that, fuck that noise, and fuck you Niantic
6791260	6794260	for not doing any goddamn research
6794260	6799260	and working with a good place like ASAN,
6799260	6801260	the Autism Self Advocacy Network,
6801260	6804260	and any of these other places that are not just
6804260	6806260	this money-grabbing shithole.
6806260	6808260	They are on par with the Komen Foundation.
6808260	6810260	They are just completely terrible.
6810260	6813260	Do not give Autism Speaks any of your money,
6813260	6819260	and if you are in Arizona, please do not support this event.
6819260	6822260	Give your money to a good service
6822260	6825260	that will do good things for people with autism.
6825260	6828260	Now Niantic did seem to acknowledge some of the feedback,
6828260	6831260	but I got the sense they kind of had to do it in a way
6831260	6833260	that they weren't going to pull out of the event,
6833260	6835260	but they may not be able to.
6835260	6837260	Honestly, it may be at the point where it's kind of like
6837260	6839260	once you commit something, you can't really do it.
6839260	6841260	You can't really necessarily just yank yourself out,
6841260	6843260	especially if the check's already been cashed.
6843260	6845260	But I remember seeing a tweet from them that kind of said,
6845260	6847260	we heard your feedback, and we look forward to working
6847260	6849260	with other charities in the future.
6849260	6851260	We want to hear your feedback on what charities
6851260	6853260	we should be working with type of thing.
6853260	6855260	That's kind of what I drew from it.
6855260	6860260	But I guess for maybe folks that don't totally like,
6860260	6863260	because this is a good comparison in my head
6863260	6867260	to kind of understand where your anger comes from,
6867260	6872260	is that this would be if Niantic got an offer on their desk
6872260	6877260	that says, we want you to sign up for this charity
6877260	6879260	that helps gay children.
6879260	6881260	This charity helps gay children,
6881260	6883260	and we want you to be a partner in this
6883260	6886260	so we can raise money to help gay children.
6886260	6888260	And Niantic probably thinks, oh, that sounds like,
6888260	6890260	you're right, there's so many gay kids out there
6890260	6892260	that get kicked out of their homes,
6892260	6895260	and they need a place to go, and we want to help.
6895260	6897260	You're right, we should sign off on that,
6897260	6899260	because that sounds good, and that's doing good.
6899260	6902260	And then it turns out, what did this charity mean
6902260	6904260	when they say, help gay children?
6904260	6906260	It's conversion therapy.
6906260	6908260	It's conversion therapy, electroshock therapy,
6908260	6910260	or something like that, right?
6910260	6912260	Is that a fair comparison to where your anger comes from
6912260	6914260	when you talk about Autism Speaks?
6914260	6916260	Is that it's like...
6916260	6919260	Probably not in that level of extreme,
6919260	6924260	but it's just where the place that they're coming from is.
6925260	6928260	Is that they treat us like we're a disease.
6928260	6931260	Like, there's something wrong with us to cure.
6931260	6934260	And neurodivergence is not a disease.
6934260	6936260	It is how your brain is wired.
6936260	6939260	And there are a lot of us who function perfectly fine in the world.
6939260	6941260	I mean, there's a lot of nonverbal people.
6941260	6944260	There's a lot of people who just completely cannot function.
6944260	6947260	Those people could probably use more assistance.
6947260	6950260	But what we need a lot is people to understand
6950260	6952260	that not everyone is going to approach things
6952260	6955260	from the same point of view that you do.
6956260	6959260	It takes multiple levels of thought
6959260	6962260	and thought processes to make the world work.
6962260	6965260	If you are finding that you can't communicate with someone with autism,
6965260	6967260	maybe you should change how you talk
6967260	6970260	instead of asking them to rewire themselves.
6970260	6974260	How does Niantic get themselves out of this hole that they've dug
6974260	6977260	with especially the autistic community?
6978260	6980260	Short of pulling out.
6980260	6983260	Let's say checks been cashed.
6983260	6985260	Pulling out at this point is not an option.
6985260	6988260	So short of that, what can they do to fix this?
6988260	6990260	Not work with Autism Speaks again.
6990260	6992260	I mean, ever again.
6992260	6995260	I did find the two posts that they made about that,
6995260	6997260	so I'll just read them real quick.
6997260	7001260	They basically left out all mention of Autism Speaks now.
7001260	7005260	We're excited to support the SARRC in their walk,
7006260	7008260	which is directly benefiting the school,
7008260	7011260	and appreciate the response that many of you had about the event.
7011260	7013260	If you want to read more about them and their work,
7013260	7015260	we encourage you to learn here, autismcenter.org.
7015260	7019260	So that I think they are separating themselves from Autism Speaks already,
7019260	7021260	which is good.
7021260	7023260	And then the second thing was the one that you said.
7023260	7025260	We hear and appreciate all the feedback
7025260	7027260	as well as the other recommendations for autism organizations
7027260	7029260	that you'd love to see supported.
7029260	7033260	So please continue to share some of the organizations you're close to.
7033260	7036260	So I think that they are realizing
7036260	7039260	that they did dig themselves into a pile of shit,
7039260	7045260	and are really just...
7047260	7051260	I will say to Niantic's somewhat credit,
7051260	7053260	not in this situation certainly,
7053260	7058260	but it is nice to see Niantic wanting to use their game to benefit charities.
7058260	7061260	It's a worthy... I mean, they've just got to get the right charities.
7062260	7067260	One person that posted something in a response
7067260	7070260	is actually exactly how I feel.
7070260	7072260	And the thing is that they're still not acknowledging
7072260	7076260	that SARRC still has ties to Autism Speaks.
7076260	7081260	Rewording it isn't going to completely change this.
7081260	7085260	Especially the fact that Autism Speaks actually has a background
7085260	7089260	in being involved in eugenics programs.
7089260	7092260	And has for a while. It's completely disgusting.
7092260	7094260	But here's the response I like.
7094260	7098260	This is Shiroko Spooky at Yomacon.
7098260	7101260	I'm extremely disturbed to think that you'd financially support
7101260	7104260	or promote an organization dedicated to erasing people like me
7104260	7108260	through quote prevention via keeping autistic babies
7108260	7110260	from even being born simply because they're autistic
7110260	7114260	and quote treatment via shock therapy and worse.
7114260	7117260	So taking Autism Speaks out of it,
7117260	7120260	and still using another organization that works closely with them,
7120260	7123260	I don't want any of my money going to this.
7123260	7128260	So when the event is over, I will buy stuff again.
7128260	7132260	But I'm going to make 100% positive that there has been no association
7132260	7135260	if I start giving them money again.
7135260	7139260	Because they're not getting a cent from me until this is over.
7139260	7142260	Getting some comments from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
7142260	7143260	Rama in chat says,
7143260	7146260	I don't think Niantic really knew how bad Autism Speaks really is.
7146260	7147260	S2100matt says,
7147260	7149260	I think Niantic's heart was in the right place,
7149260	7151260	but they just didn't do the proper research.
7151260	7152260	They've learned their lesson now.
7152260	7155260	Well, your brain needs to be in the right place.
7155260	7156260	Time will see.
7156260	7159260	So, Dr. C in chat says,
7159260	7161260	I've heard all the bullshit Autism Speaks has been up to.
7161260	7163260	I used to follow Hot Wheels on Facebook.
7163260	7165260	Hey, been a fan of the diecast car since I was little.
7165260	7168260	But then I found out they were teaming up with Autism Speaks on something,
7168260	7169260	so I was done.
7169260	7173260	So, you know, and kind of something I expressed,
7173260	7175260	we were texting about this yesterday or the day before,
7175260	7177260	I was kind of expressing shock.
7177260	7180260	I was like, well, I mean, I get that this is bothersome,
7180260	7184260	but how does this fucking charity stay afloat?
7184260	7186260	Like, that's my bigger question.
7186260	7190260	Like, how is this charity even still in existence?
7190260	7193260	So, I guess education is a big part of that.
7193260	7195260	Wasn't I saying it has a lot to do with their PR?
7195260	7196260	Probably.
7196260	7197260	You know, the fact that,
7197260	7202260	and I even have an autistic friend who says that she got a lot of assistance from them.
7203260	7208260	But, you know, and doesn't see where all the bad press is coming from,
7208260	7211260	but I'm like, how about the rest of us who have been a complete,
7211260	7214260	or, you know, there's people in other threads I've seen on there,
7214260	7218260	who when they got their diagnosis as an adult reached out for assistance
7218260	7222260	and were basically just completely ignored or told to find somebody else.
7222260	7224260	Like, in those words.
7224260	7230260	You know, it's, and the thing I like about the Autism Self Advocacy Network
7230260	7234260	is that their motto is nothing for us without us.
7234260	7239260	And there's not many things that I will get super heated about.
7239260	7241260	There are some things.
7241260	7244260	This one I feel very passionately about because…
7244260	7245260	Well, sure.
7245260	7248260	And that's why I really brought up the scenario about the whole, like,
7248260	7251260	conversion therapy thing, like, trying to make an analogy.
7251260	7255260	Because if it was that, like, not that I'm not pissed off on your behalf,
7255260	7259260	but, like, I would be really pissed off if it was, like, the scenario I described.
7259260	7262260	Now that I think about it, actually it is fairly apt because, I mean,
7262260	7265260	they are doing shock therapy to autistic kids out there.
7265260	7267260	That's what they're thinking, yeah.
7267260	7271260	And even though he's one of my favorite actors, Jim Beaver,
7271260	7278260	who was on Supernatural, I reached out to him to ask about his daughter's treatment
7278260	7281260	because his daughter was, I think, non-verbal for a while.
7281260	7283260	And he's like, she's not autistic anymore.
7283260	7286260	I'm like, what the fuck do you mean she's not autistic anymore?
7286260	7288260	You never are not autistic.
7288260	7290260	It just means she's learned behavioral therapies.
7290260	7294260	You cannot cure autism.
7294260	7296260	It's not a disease.
7296260	7298260	And vaccines don't cause it.
7298260	7300260	Autism Speaks used to be on the bandwagon with that too.
7300260	7301260	I know, I know.
7301260	7302260	All right, anyway.
7302260	7304260	I'm sure we could do a whole…
7304260	7306260	We have a show full of three-hour shows tonight,
7306260	7308260	but I do want to move on for now.
7308260	7311260	But, hey, if nothing else, the people listening tonight
7311260	7313260	maybe learned something tonight, so.
7313260	7316260	Won't make the same booboo as Niantic.
7316260	7319260	So, anyhow, let's move on with some more news stories.
7319260	7322260	Just a couple more, actually, and then we're going to get to the Skype line
7322260	7324260	at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7324260	7326260	And this may actually be the…
7326260	7328260	No, I think we'll still have Skype next week
7328260	7331260	because I'll probably just use the iPad to work around it.
7331260	7334260	But Skype's sadly a daze with our show.
7334260	7335260	Maybe a little bit numbered.
7335260	7336260	We'll see.
7336260	7337260	Anyway, for now, for now, for now.
7337260	7341260	I'm not saying that we won't have a way to take calls one way or another.
7341260	7343260	If I have to bring back the 800 number and do that whole thing,
7343260	7346260	then we'll do it that way, but we'll work on that.
7346260	7348260	Anyway, for now, Loki.
7348260	7351260	So, there's this massive Fallout mod that's been released
7351260	7355260	called Fallout New Californians, a mod for Fallout New Vegas.
7355260	7359260	And it's finished, and you can play it now, so go check it out.
7359260	7364260	Apparently it's been a project that's been in the works for about six years now.
7364260	7368260	They have a ton of content in this.
7368260	7373260	There's 42 missions in the game, 13 different endings.
7373260	7376260	Depending on your play style, it'll take about six to eight hours
7376260	7379260	to 15 to 30 hours if you're a completionist.
7379260	7384260	The play's almost 17,000 lines of dialogue spoken by…
7384260	7390260	They said about 15,000 of those, which are spoken by 60 volunteer voice actors.
7390260	7393260	Yeah, so it's awesome.
7393260	7397260	So if you're interested in checking it out, go to moddb.com slash mods slash
7397260	7403260	Fallout Project Brazil, and you'll find Fallout New California.
7403260	7405260	I'm thinking about checking this out.
7405260	7406260	Yeah, it sounds like fun.
7406260	7410260	Because I'm not picking up Fallout 76, so maybe.
7410260	7413260	A different way to experience Fallout in the next few days, I suppose.
7413260	7414260	Yeah.
7414260	7419260	Alright, I got one more Twitter fuckup for you guys to close out the news tonight,
7419260	7421260	and I'm sure you guys have heard of this one.
7421260	7425260	This one's shitty. There's really no way around this one.
7425260	7430260	It comes from goodoldgames.com, or GOGcom as they're known on Twitter.
7430260	7433260	They wrote a tweet earlier this week that said,
7433260	7437260	classic PC games hashtag won't be erased on our watch.
7437260	7440260	Yeah, how's that for some use of hashtags?
7440260	7443260	And they deleted that tweet, and the reason why that was a shitty tweet
7443260	7449260	is because hashtag won't be erased is a Twitter hashtag that has been used a lot
7449260	7453260	by the trans community in response to a lot of the news
7453260	7458260	that has come out of our government about how basically the president
7458260	7463260	and some advice counselor, I don't know all the legal names of things,
7463260	7468260	but in a nutshell, the president and the people around him want to
7468260	7474260	basically legal define his two genders that are defined by, you know,
7474260	7477260	what's in your pants, and it's gross.
7477260	7484260	And I want any trans folks out there listening to know that I support you.
7484260	7487260	You're valid. This is bullshit.
7487260	7490260	And that's why I think it pissed a lot of people off
7490260	7494260	when GOGcom decided to make a joke out of it, you know?
7494260	7498260	I mean, the second sentence there, yeah, how's that for some use of hashtags?
7498260	7504260	Fuck off. Like, how dare you? Go fucking sell games.
7504260	7509260	Like, do you think you're fucking edgy like Wendy's or Arby's or something?
7509260	7512260	That's not edgy. That is not, like, this is very-
7512260	7514260	That's cunty.
7514260	7518260	One way. But, I mean, this is a serious issue that, you know,
7518260	7521260	this is not the time. Like, if you want to look at, like,
7521260	7524260	how to, like, be ruffle feathers or whatever on Twitter,
7524260	7528260	go look up Wendy's account or something. Wendy's would not do something stupid like that.
7528260	7530260	Well, at least I hope they wouldn't. You know what I mean?
7530260	7533260	So, it was just, oh, it was really gross.
7533260	7539260	And what makes it worse, like, it would be one thing if this is the first time this has happened.
7539260	7541260	But it's not the first time this has happened.
7541260	7546260	So, the social media team at Good Old Games and CD Projekt Red,
7546260	7551260	which this all kind of runs up to, is they run the Good Old Games.
7551260	7553260	And, of course, they're making the Cyberpunk 2077,
7553260	7556260	which was where one of the other bad tweets came from, was that account.
7556260	7562260	The social management at this team, like, needs, like, a good, hard, scolding, probably firing,
7562260	7567260	but, you know, some serious education on how to conduct themselves online
7567260	7569260	and what is and what isn't appropriate.
7569260	7572260	And there's a lot of people calling for some serious change over there.
7572260	7578260	Or they're going to pay for it in other ways, such as the fact that, as a result of this,
7578260	7584260	the makers of Journey Quest, Zombie Orpheus, cancelled their contract with Good Old Games.
7584260	7590260	They, as soon as, you know, this happened again, they basically said, the CEO Ben Dobbins said,
7590260	7594260	quote, the harm that hate speech does to people who are under immense threat from governments,
7594260	7597260	private individuals and corporations is incalculable.
7597260	7601260	It's downright sociopathic to demean our friends and allies in this way.
7601260	7604260	There's absolutely nothing funny about any of it.
7604260	7608260	And that's the same reason why I won't buy any of the Witcher games or that new Cyberpunk game coming out.
7608260	7611260	That company has done the same shit, too.
7611260	7618260	Yeah, well, I mean, I would be a little more comfortable buying that stuff because here's the thing.
7618260	7623260	Like, the social media team is bonkers crazy with this stuff.
7623260	7627260	I don't want that to invalidate necessarily the hard work of all these people that are making the game,
7627260	7629260	the hundreds of other people.
7629260	7634260	But that social media stuff needs to change and it needs to be communicated to us how it's going to change.
7634260	7636260	And if that doesn't happen, then we have no other choice.
7636260	7643260	But I'm not going to give my money to a company that thinks it's OK to do that.
7643260	7644260	And honestly, I...
7644260	7649260	Right, and they need to come out in very plain language and not these runaround tweets.
7649260	7654260	They come out in very plain language and say how it's going to be different, in my opinion.
7654260	7659260	I'm not going to support a company that allows that, even for the sake of the employees, I'm sorry.
7659260	7664260	Because they're just going to, if we keep doing that, they're going to keep doing that shit.
7664260	7666260	You have to vote with your money.
7666260	7667260	Fair enough.
7667260	7670260	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
7670260	7673260	SSJ100Matt says, GOG needs to delete their account.
7673260	7675260	That would be a good resolution as well.
7675260	7678260	Dungeonbuster in chat says, I was pretty shocked when I read this story.
7678260	7682260	And dartitsuya says, I remember that one about Cyber 2077 months ago.
7682260	7684260	It was probably the same asshole.
7684260	7686260	Yeah, so...
7686260	7690260	If you're going to do social media, like, remember you are representing a whole company.
7690260	7695260	And stop being edgy for clicks.
7695260	7698260	And if, like, don't...
7698260	7703260	Like, if you're going to be edgy, do it the way Wendy's does it by talking shit about McDonald's.
7703260	7704260	That's funny.
7704260	7706260	This? Not funny.
7706260	7708260	So, anyway.
7708260	7711260	What's your favorite Wendy's tweet?
7711260	7713260	I don't know.
7714260	7720260	Probably, you know, the most famous tweet of all time or the most retweeted was the guy that asked for the chicken nuggets from Wendy's.
7720260	7723260	I guess that was as annoying as that whole thing, I think, ended up becoming.
7723260	7726260	I think that was a pretty epic thing on Wendy's behalf. I don't know.
7726260	7729260	What happened with that? Did he get his chicken nuggets?
7729260	7731260	I think he did get his chicken nuggets, yeah.
7731260	7738260	But he actually tweeted Wendy's and was like, how many for free McNuggets, or not McNuggets, but whatever, just free nuggets for life or whatever.
7738260	7741260	And Wendy's said it was, I don't know, 18 million.
7741260	7742260	And he got, like, really close.
7742260	7744260	And Wendy's, I think, gave him the free nuggets anyway.
7744260	7749260	And I'm sure it was all done on the Ellen show, because that's how these things always resolve themselves.
7751260	7753260	Anyway.
7753260	7756260	We are going to open up the Skype line right now.
7756260	7758260	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7758260	7764260	If you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight, or perhaps something else, while we wait to see if any calls come in.
7764260	7766260	I don't know if we have any last minute stories.
7766260	7781260	There was some pictures of some prototypes that apparently Microsoft's been working on as far as controllers that would attach to some sort of phone or tablet device to go along with this whole streaming service that they were going to be doing, the Project X cloud.
7781260	7786260	So they have some prototypes that show, like, some controller things that look neat.
7786260	7790260	I mean, looks like they might be comfy.
7791260	7794260	It kind of reminds me a little bit of, like, the Switch dock a little bit.
7794260	7800260	Because they have, you know, basically this piece that goes in the middle that you put the two halves into to charge it.
7800260	7803260	And they would just clip on the side of your phone or whatever.
7805260	7807260	I could see that, I guess.
7807260	7810260	So curious where Microsoft's going to go for their next console.
7810260	7814260	I wonder if they're really going to try to do something a little more radical with their next console.
7814260	7818260	Like, you know, how, like, Nintendo did the whole, you know, take it anywhere you go type of thing.
7818260	7822260	Like, what is Microsoft going to try to do something that really sells that ecosystem with PC?
7822260	7825260	Or, like, what are they going to do for their next consoles?
7825260	7830260	Because I think we all expect that PlayStation 5 is just going to be, like, more PlayStation 4, but, like, more parts.
7830260	7832260	You know, that whole type of thing.
7832260	7835260	You know, maybe VR integrated a little more or something.
7835260	7841260	But, you know, it's interesting to guess where Microsoft's going to go next.
7841260	7843260	I'm just curious where everything's going to go.
7843260	7846260	Because, I don't know.
7846260	7850260	You know, we'll probably have it all figured out by the time we get to episode 1,000.
7850260	7853260	Probably will.
7853260	7860260	Who would have thought that the MECO is going to take over the market and become the dominating force of everything?
7860260	7862260	Who would have thought?
7862260	7864260	Who would have thought?
7864260	7867260	Do you think this show's going to get to 1,000 episodes?
7867260	7868260	Probably.
7868260	7870260	How many years is it going to take to do 200?
7870260	7871260	That's about five more years of episodes.
7871260	7873260	So we've got five more years left in us?
7873260	7874260	Yeah.
7874260	7876260	What the hell?
7876260	7880260	We have to make sure all the kids are old enough to take over the show properly once we're done.
7880260	7886260	We have to make sure, like, Julian, whoever else's kids wants to come in, take over the show.
7886260	7889260	That they're, like, 18 and they're good to take it over.
7889260	7891260	So.
7891260	7894260	Fuck if I won't let those kids take over the show.
7894260	7899260	Over my dead body!
7899260	7900260	Let's see.
7900260	7905260	Oh, Mega Man X400 says, I tried calling on Skype and it doesn't seem like it's working.
7905260	7906260	Uh oh, that's not good.
7906260	7908260	We should let Midna and Smoosh do the show.
7908260	7910260	Let me.
7910260	7912260	I'm going to restart Skype.
7912260	7914260	Actually, one thing I always do is I try to call for my phone.
7914260	7916260	I'm going to try calling for my phone and see if that works.
7916260	7919260	And then if it doesn't, I'll give it a good old trusty reboot.
7919260	7921260	This is going to be meh.
7921260	7922260	Meh.
7922260	7927260	So, in Google Fit news, apparently it's not compatible with the Fitbit.
7927260	7929260	So they can fuck right off because.
7929260	7930260	Really?
7930260	7931260	How the fuck am I going to track?
7931260	7934260	You have two apps open to track mileage?
7934260	7935260	Fuck that shit.
7935260	7937260	Seriously.
7937260	7940260	Okay, yeah, I just called the Skype line and it worked fine.
7940260	7945260	Just make sure you're using Orange Launch Radio, all one word, on Skype.
7945260	7947260	And it should work.
7947260	7949260	But we'll see.
7949260	7952260	But I did call a test just now and it worked.
7952260	7954260	Any other stories you want to get to, Loki?
7955260	7963260	There's speculation that the PlayStation 5 will have a built-in VR functionality to let players track their movement without an external device.
7963260	7964260	Hmm.
7964260	7968260	So, apparently according to some patent information.
7968260	7969260	Interesting.
7969260	7971260	That's neat, I guess.
7971260	7977260	There was an exploit in Grand Theft Auto 5 that allowed hackers to kill people in single player.
7978260	7981260	If you're connected to Rockstar Social Club.
7981260	7990260	Because apparently they were hacking using the admin tools that apparently they had super user powers that could do all sorts of shenanigans.
7990260	7992260	And that did get patched out, thankfully.
7992260	7994260	But it was a thing.
7994260	7998260	Yeah, multiplayer mode is no fun to be fucking around with on that stuff.
7998260	8000260	But this was single player though, this was not multiplayer mode.
8000260	8001260	Oh, I thought it was multiplayer mode.
8001260	8003260	This was in single player that people were getting hacked.
8003260	8004260	Yikes.
8004260	8005260	If they were, you know, online.
8005260	8006260	Oh dear.
8006260	8009260	So, yeah, not fun there either.
8009260	8011260	Glad they closed that out.
8011260	8014260	Yooka-Laylee's getting a 64-bit mode.
8014260	8019260	It's gonna look like Nintendo 64 or Banjo-Kazooie since, I mean, that is what it's kind of...
8019260	8021260	So it's getting a retro filter.
8021260	8022260	Inspired by, yeah.
8022260	8027260	Retro filter with all of the blurry, low-resolution assets.
8027260	8028260	Fantastic.
8028260	8031260	So that's kind of neat, I guess.
8032260	8035260	Another completely random thought.
8035260	8037260	I was looking at release dates coming out.
8037260	8043260	And did you know that the same day Smash Brothers comes out on the Switch, Katamari comes out as well.
8043260	8045260	Oh no, I didn't realize they shared the same day.
8045260	8047260	And it's on PC, so I'm totally picking that bump on PC.
8047260	8049260	The Katamari game's on PC.
8049260	8050260	It says it's on PC.
8050260	8051260	Oh, that's great.
8051260	8052260	I'm excited for that.
8052260	8054260	Because I'm looking for mods.
8054260	8055260	Fuck yeah, new levels.
8055260	8056260	Hell yes.
8056260	8058260	Yeah, they're gonna mod the shit out of that.
8059260	8060260	Other people will fucking support that shit.
8060260	8062260	They'll break that shit apart and make it awesome.
8062260	8064260	Oh, that's really exciting about PC.
8064260	8066260	We rolling up giant dicks in no time.
8066260	8070260	What to do, mods on PC or portability on Switch?
8070260	8072260	It's hard to decide.
8072260	8077260	You buy the Switch version, then you wait for the sale on PC because Switch games never fucking go on sale.
8077260	8078260	Okay.
8078260	8079260	You can just do that and you get both.
8079260	8080260	Alright.
8080260	8081260	That's some critical thinking.
8081260	8082260	I like that.
8083260	8086260	Dark Sakura, when are we gonna get to see you next here in studio?
8086260	8087260	Another fourth Sunday.
8087260	8088260	Another fourth Sunday.
8088260	8089260	Alright.
8089260	8090260	We'll see.
8090260	8093260	Well, I think, I don't know if Skype is broken or what.
8093260	8096260	Even though I just did a test call, it worked fine.
8096260	8097260	Something must be going on.
8097260	8101260	So it's nice to see Skype on Windows XP going out with a whimper.
8101260	8102260	Oh, and then of course.
8102260	8103260	Here on episode 750.
8103260	8108260	With us, there was a big ol' 4chan Smash Brothers rumors thing this week.
8108260	8115260	You know, allegedly there was artwork, marketing artwork that was leaked,
8115260	8118260	showing the full banner with all the characters in there.
8118260	8121260	It's crazy the amount of investigation.
8121260	8125260	The blurry guesses based on what they saw.
8125260	8134260	Shadow, the Hedgehog, Banjo-Kazooie, Isaac, Ken, Mock Rider, Geno, and Chorus Kids.
8134260	8135260	We'll see.
8137260	8138260	I mean, coming from 4chan.
8138260	8139260	Come on.
8139260	8140260	Come on.
8141260	8142260	We're only a few months away.
8143260	8144260	Alright.
8144260	8145260	We'll just wait and see.
8146260	8147260	I know, that's where my head is at.
8147260	8152260	Is it like, you know, oh they've got these, you know, leaks and things and all this analysis.
8152260	8154260	There's been so many fake leaks anyways.
8154260	8159260	Remember the whole Rayman leaked in with the last version of Smash that Rayman was gonna be in the game?
8159260	8165260	Is it really going to change your perception on if you're gonna buy the game or not?
8165260	8169260	Like, are you really gonna change your mind based on these last character leaks?
8169260	8170260	No.
8170260	8172260	Like, you know, all the people whooping and hollering.
8172260	8175260	If Geno isn't in the game, I'm not gonna buy it.
8175260	8176260	It's like, yeah right.
8176260	8177260	Yeah right.
8178260	8180260	Hey, we got a call coming in.
8180260	8184260	I'm sure this person is helping us test the line or something, but let's see.
8184260	8186260	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8186260	8187260	Who's this?
8187260	8188260	I think it works.
8188260	8189260	It does work.
8189260	8190260	I knew it worked.
8190260	8191260	I don't know what's going on.
8191260	8192260	Hey Bobby, how you doing?
8192260	8193260	I'm doing well.
8193260	8194260	How are you?
8194260	8195260	Good.
8195260	8197260	It's the host of the one and only Bobby Blackwell Show here on our show.
8197260	8198260	That's right.
8198260	8199260	That's right.
8199260	8202260	We'll let us in at the end of your show, but it's nice to have you here, especially
8202260	8204260	on a big episode number like this.
8204260	8205260	Yes.
8205260	8206260	Yes.
8206260	8207260	750.
8207260	8208260	This was a momentous episode.
8208260	8209260	It was.
8209260	8210260	Just because.
8210260	8211260	It was.
8211260	8212260	They're all momentous episodes.
8212260	8213260	Very special.
8213260	8214260	We did a lot of special things.
8214260	8215260	Yes.
8215260	8216260	What's on your mind tonight?
8216260	8217260	Nothing.
8217260	8220260	I'm actually just trying to get stuff to work on Windows 10.
8220260	8224260	Because trying to get a microphone to work with no delay, that's the thing that kills
8224260	8225260	me.
8225260	8226260	Oh yeah.
8226260	8228260	That's the thing that's always made me nervous about the Windows 10 upgrade is the whole
8228260	8235260	delay and all that stuff, but there's a whole, but then money and that you're locked into
8235260	8238260	one system, but garage band is better.
8238260	8240260	I don't know for what we do with live.
8240260	8241260	I don't think it is.
8241260	8242260	If this were taped.
8242260	8243260	Absolutely.
8243260	8245260	It would work great for life.
8245260	8246260	Yeah.
8246260	8247260	Yeah.
8247260	8249260	Especially with the, with the, with the Twitch and all that other stuff.
8249260	8250260	I don't know.
8250260	8251260	It's gonna be the right option.
8251260	8253260	I know how to make it all work.
8253260	8254260	Come up with a proposal.
8254260	8255260	We'll look into it.
8255260	8256260	All right.
8256260	8259260	Kajudo in chat says, my mic never delayed on Windows 10.
8259260	8261260	I, I think it's because this is the onboard one.
8261260	8264260	Cause like I'm seeing like other things that are like, well, if you use a different sound
8264260	8269260	card, so I may like when I build a new machine, actually put like a special, a different sound
8269260	8271260	card in there and that may help.
8271260	8273260	Cause that's what I've got in my Windows 7 machine.
8273260	8274260	Yeah.
8274260	8280260	So, so, and I don't think my work would let me use my Mac laptop for this type of stuff
8280260	8282260	because that's the only Mac I have.
8282260	8283260	Yeah.
8283260	8284260	Yeah.
8284260	8289260	Um, and I was going to say, um, Oh, uh, with the, the, with all the windows stuff I was
8289260	8293260	looking into, I was going to look at getting a USB sound blaster.
8293260	8298260	Cause my last idea was getting a laptop, you know, because they make laptops that are beefier
8298260	8300260	than what we run OLR on now.
8300260	8305260	So get a laptop, use an, uh, USB, uh, sound blaster card with it.
8305260	8310260	Get kind of redo the mixing board to go all digital with it and a little more cause we
8310260	8311260	can probably scale it down.
8311260	8315260	We have like a full on like music, like mixing board.
8315260	8317260	It probably doesn't need to be as good as what we have.
8317260	8319260	Kind of scale that back and make it digital.
8319260	8322260	And I think it, I think it'll be great for, um, OLR.
8322260	8323260	Yeah.
8323260	8325260	I'm looking at all this stuff too.
8325260	8326260	Yeah.
8326260	8330260	So it's going to be, uh, going to be some big changes ahead, but, uh, hopefully we'll
8330260	8332260	be able to get that settled in the next month or so.
8332260	8335260	Probably it's something I'm going to be looking to do during like the Thanksgiving break.
8335260	8336260	So we'll see.
8336260	8337260	Yeah.
8337260	8339260	And everybody's like, my mic didn't delay in windows 10.
8339260	8340260	What's happening?
8340260	8345260	What happens is like when I'm listening to it with headphones, cause I like to hear my
8345260	8351260	own levels, uh, in windows seven, it's, I just hear myself and it's not, it doesn't
8351260	8352260	mess me up or anything.
8352260	8357260	I'm like, I'm just a little louder in my ears, which is great in windows 10 and windows eight
8357260	8358260	actually.
8358260	8362260	Cause my laptop is windows eight still cause I never upgraded it to 10 cause it couldn't.
8362260	8364260	I didn't have hardware drivers for it.
8364260	8368260	It would be just, it's like not even a full second off.
8368260	8370260	It's like maybe like a fourth of a second.
8370260	8372260	It's like 200 milliseconds maybe.
8372260	8376260	That's when it would come back and it's just enough of an echo to mess with you.
8376260	8377260	Yeah.
8377260	8378260	Yeah.
8378260	8380260	And we have, I mean like here in studio, we don't use headphones.
8380260	8384260	We actually have like speakers, but technically our own voices go out through the speakers.
8384260	8386260	Thankfully there's no lag.
8386260	8389260	So it just kind of sounds like our voices are amplified here in the room a little bit,
8389260	8393260	but it's how we hear you guys on Skype and the various onboard noises and those very
8393260	8397260	limited places where we do like YouTube's or let's say the intro, I guess the intro
8397260	8400260	is something that's every week, you know, or the little music beds that happen over
8400260	8401260	classic of the week.
8401260	8404260	We can hear all that in studio and that kind of helps us a lot.
8404260	8405260	Yeah.
8405260	8407260	And Kajudo says, you know, use virtual audio cables.
8407260	8408260	You can set the delay.
8408260	8412260	The problem is you can't delay it back in time.
8412260	8416260	You can delay it forward in time, but not necessarily back in time.
8416260	8421260	So if virtual audio cables doesn't get it until a hundred milliseconds after it's
8421260	8425260	come out of your mouth, there's nothing it can do to make it go back a hundred milliseconds.
8425260	8426260	Right.
8426260	8429260	Unless you're the doctor.
8429260	8431260	Which may be the only way.
8431260	8432260	Yeah.
8432260	8437260	So it's a fun, but like music producers have this issue all the time.
8437260	8441260	And so they've been talking about this because it's very hard to do karaoke like this.
8441260	8442260	Yes.
8442260	8443260	For instance.
8443260	8447260	And, you know, anybody that tries to like record music has these kind of issues.
8447260	8451260	And I know Mac is better on this stuff, but I can't afford a Mac.
8451260	8455260	So and I've got a Mac here and I'm sure it would work great, but my work would really
8455260	8457260	get upset at me for using my Mac.
8457260	8459260	You have to separate work and play.
8459260	8462260	I know people though who do all their stuff off Mac minis.
8462260	8466260	I'm running Logic Pro X.
8466260	8470260	So just, and I already own a copy, so.
8470260	8471260	What was it?
8471260	8474260	I was looking in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
8474260	8478260	Tigerclaw does point out that the virtual audio cable is good for audio, but not for video.
8478260	8482260	So, and that's obviously an important direction for the future of what we're doing as well.
8483260	8486260	So it's got to be able to do both, which is what we're looking into.
8486260	8487260	So.
8487260	8490260	I was trying to set something up to stream tonight from that machine.
8490260	8494260	And I'm not sure if it's done yet or not, but I finally like, I'm like, okay, I don't
8494260	8498260	monitor myself when I'm streaming video, so it'll be fine.
8498260	8502260	But I hadn't actually hooked up one of my good mics to this machine yet.
8502260	8503260	So I was trying to play around with that.
8503260	8505260	I'm like, can I get the delay done?
8505260	8507260	Because this is a fast enough computer.
8507260	8510260	Why don't you tell us a little bit about the stream after the show tonight, even though
8510260	8513260	I know it's a podcast and they'll miss it.
8513260	8515260	Please pimp your stream.
8515260	8519260	So I was considering if I can get everything set up, and I don't have, because I haven't
8519260	8523260	hooked up this camera to it yet, and I finally got that working.
8523260	8528260	Yeah, Windows 10 thankfully turns off all the privacy on your microphone and your camera,
8528260	8530260	so other apps can't access it.
8530260	8532260	It's off by default, or at least it was for me.
8532260	8536260	So I'm like, why can't I see my webcam in OBS?
8536260	8537260	And that's why.
8537260	8539260	So, pro tip if you can't get it working.
8539260	8544260	But I just got Forza Horizon 4 on my PC up here.
8544260	8550260	So I've been playing it in 4K on the Xbox One, but I've got it on the PC, so I think
8550260	8555260	I may be able to stream it tonight, and if anybody wants to Horizon Convoy or something,
8555260	8560260	we can meet up in Discord or something and try to do some multiplayer.
8560260	8562260	I tried to do some multiplayer.
8562260	8568260	I jumped into Brad from PodCulture's game, and he immediately was like, no, I don't play
8568260	8569260	online with other people.
8569260	8572260	And so I was like, okay.
8572260	8575260	Well, you can play however you want to play, that's right.
8575260	8576260	Yep.
8576260	8579260	He's like, I didn't realize I was online, and he just went offline.
8579260	8580260	Yep.
8580260	8583260	What was I going to say with all that stuff too?
8583260	8589260	Oh, make sure of course you're following Bobby over on Twitch, and I need to level myself
8589260	8593260	up on Forza to get all to that stuff, because I've kind of slacked on Forza 4.
8593260	8594260	Yeah, I'm still not going there yet either.
8594260	8599260	Yeah, so I'll probably need to play some of that this week to at least unlock that stuff.
8599260	8601260	We could probably still do an adventure mode thing or something, I don't know.
8601260	8602260	Yeah, maybe.
8602260	8603260	I don't know if I'll be around tonight.
8603260	8605260	I think I'm doing an errand after the show, so.
8605260	8609260	But, I wish you success with your stream, and of course, you know, thanks.
8609260	8613260	I know you haven't been there for all 750 episodes, but honestly, you've been there
8613260	8617260	for the majority of them, and it's always fantastic having you around, Bobby.
8617260	8618260	Thank you.
8618260	8619260	You're welcome.
8619260	8621260	Best of luck with your show, and we'll talk to you next week.
8621260	8622260	All right.
8622260	8623260	Just not on Skype and Windows XP.
8623260	8624260	No.
8624260	8625260	All right.
8625260	8626260	Later.
8626260	8627260	Yeah.
8627260	8628260	All right.
8628260	8629260	Let's see.
8629260	8631260	I wanted to get to a question in our chat room, because Mega Man X or Delvin was trying
8631260	8632260	to get in.
8632260	8637260	He couldn't, so he wanted to ask a question kind of like over this, so I'll get to this.
8637260	8640260	He says, I guess I will ask my question here to you guys.
8640260	8647260	What are your guys' thoughts on the increase in IRL streams on Twitch?
8647260	8651260	With TwitchCon this weekend, I was able to watch a few people streaming from there, and
8651260	8652260	I felt like I...
8652260	8653260	Excuse me.
8653260	8654260	I felt like I was there.
8654260	8655260	LOL.
8655260	8658260	I should have watched more streams from TwitchCon.
8658260	8662260	I didn't even think to do that, but again, I was really busy yesterday, so I didn't really
8662260	8663260	have time to do it either.
8663260	8669260	What do you guys think about watching IRL streams and how IRL is really growing a presence
8669260	8671260	on Twitch?
8671260	8673260	I don't know quite what you mean by IRL.
8673260	8674260	Like real life stuff?
8674260	8675260	Yeah.
8675260	8676260	Non-gaming.
8676260	8677260	Yeah.
8677260	8678260	Non-gaming.
8678260	8679260	Like people...
8679260	8680260	ASMR is really growing.
8681260	8683260	So here's the funny thing.
8683260	8686260	When I first did my experimental stream, I was like, okay, I'm going to stream myself
8686260	8689260	playing DDR, so I did it with my phone using the Twitch app.
8689260	8690260	Guess what?
8690260	8692260	You can only do IRL crap in there.
8692260	8695260	You can't categorize the stream as gaming, so I had to do...
8695260	8701260	I think I did like dancing or something, because there was no way for me to say, I'm playing
8701260	8703260	a fucking game, you asshole.
8703260	8705260	Like put game on here.
8705260	8709260	But yeah, you can only do IRL stuff on there, so I don't know.
8709260	8714260	I don't watch any of this stuff, but neat, I guess.
8714260	8716260	I mean, I could see myself like...
8716260	8721260	Eventually when I get set up, it'd be fun to build Legos and shit on stream, and I know
8721260	8722260	people do that.
8722260	8724260	They'll put together sets and stuff, and that would be fun.
8724260	8725260	I'd be down for that.
8725260	8728260	I used to draw on livestream.
8728260	8733260	I'm not the biggest fan of like a talking head just sitting there reading their chat
8733260	8734260	and answering questions.
8734260	8735260	I don't like...
8735260	8738260	I don't think that content is particularly compelling for me.
8738260	8741260	I know there's a lot of feeds that do that, and if you're having success with that, good
8741260	8742260	for you.
8742260	8744260	It's just not compelling for me.
8744260	8747260	But I am loving the game show stuff, right?
8747260	8751260	I mentioned a few weeks ago we had Buzzer is really growing over on Twitch.
8751260	8755260	That's something I really like to watch, so I like the TV stuff that's growing more and
8755260	8756260	more.
8756260	8758260	We do have another call coming in, so I do want to get to it.
8758260	8759260	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8759260	8760260	Who's this?
8760260	8761260	Hey, what's going on, everyone?
8761260	8762260	It is Ranma.
8762260	8763260	Hey, Ranma.
8763260	8764260	It's good to hear from you.
8764260	8765260	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
8765260	8766260	It's good to hear from Oli.
8766260	8769260	We have an entire squad back together, you know?
8769260	8772260	Like, live concert, one-night-only type, you know?
8772260	8773260	I like my laser discs.
8773260	8774260	Thank you.
8774260	8775260	You're welcome.
8775260	8776260	It is.
8776260	8780260	It's a bummer we can't do this every week, but I mean, life sucks sometimes.
8780260	8781260	It is what it is.
8781260	8783260	We work around the challenges life gives us.
8783260	8784260	I know.
8784260	8789260	I mean, I've been doing my show via Skype for like the last five years, and we do have
8789260	8792260	to rotate people out here and there, so you know.
8792260	8793260	We just roll with it.
8793260	8795260	Yep, you gotta roll with it.
8795260	8796260	A couple of things.
8796260	8797260	I'll be on my merry little way.
8797260	8801260	Number one, I'm a former band geek.
8801260	8802260	Nice.
8802260	8804260	You're in good company.
8804260	8809260	I played the trombone from grade four to seven.
8809260	8810260	Okay, good call.
8810260	8814260	That's around, I played the clarinet from around six to twelve.
8814260	8818260	Good lord, you don't want to know how long I was doing band.
8818260	8819260	Your whole life.
8819260	8823260	I started on alto sax in sixth grade.
8823260	8827260	Moved on to contra alto clarinet in seventh grade.
8827260	8830260	Played tenor sax, alto clarinet, contra alto clarinet.
8830260	8835260	Went into jazz band in college and played in symphony for three years.
8835260	8837260	I was at the University of South Alabama.
8837260	8838260	Nerd.
8838260	8841260	And then I moved right here, and my saxophone got destroyed in Hurricane Katrina.
8841260	8842260	Oh, that's depressing.
8842260	8848260	Yeah, I loaned it to somebody who was a wind major.
8848260	8849260	Bastards.
8849260	8851260	How dare they?
8851260	8857260	Well, I mean, you know, it's not much you can do about the hurricane, but my clarinet is long gone.
8857260	8860260	I think it ended up going to one of my nieces who doesn't even talk to me, so whatever.
8860260	8863260	Whatever is what it is.
8863260	8868260	I was about to say the same thing, but moving right along with the whole Skype thing.
8868260	8873260	Oh, good lord almighty.
8873260	8875260	What? What are you having a laugh about?
8875260	8879260	Just laughing from what you're stressing with.
8879260	8882260	I lived it, and it was not fun.
8882260	8888260	When Microsoft said Skype 7 was being discontinued, I'm like, okay.
8888260	8893260	I had to find out all of my stuff, which version of Windows everybody's running, and figure shit out.
8893260	8899260	And I'm like, let's try doing this show on Discord.
8899260	8905260	Within the first ten minutes of it live, the lag was just atrocious.
8905260	8910260	During the musical break, we jumped back onto Skype and just rolled with it.
8910260	8917260	Because at that time, they were still trying to make Skype 8 a little bit nicer, a little bit better.
8917260	8920260	But now it's good.
8920260	8926260	The only thing is that it automatically adjusts your volume when you're talking.
8926260	8930260	And I keep disabling that, but it turns itself back off.
8930260	8934260	I hate that. Why do things turn themselves back on?
8935260	8942260	I will say this. When I play back the episode in the edits, it's solid going across, so I can't complain.
8942260	8949260	I know some podcasters are going to Discord, and Discord actually has a robot out there that you can download.
8949260	8954260	It's not an official Discord thing, but it'll actually help you record podcasts, which is interesting.
8954260	8958260	It's not great for live, but for the recorded stuff, it's another option.
8958260	8961260	Had. My other podcast, we used that.
8961260	8966260	Come to find out, I wasn't getting links to the episodes that they were recording.
8966260	8969260	Come to find out, the people running that bot shut it down.
8969260	8971260	Oh no.
8971260	8979260	Yeah, so now if I can't record the show, whoever's on it has to either fire up Audition or Audacity to record it.
8979260	8984260	Dump it to me in OneDrive or Dropbox, and I do the edits and upload.
8984260	8996260	But I will say this. When you're going to Windows 10 and Skype, you may have to definitely switch to a USB mixer or a USB sound card.
8996260	9003260	Because I notice with a lot of regular sound cards, when recording, it doesn't pick up both sides of the conversation.
9005260	9007260	I mean, but it's not that bad.
9007260	9013260	I know, but do you see why I've been stuck on Windows XP this whole time? Because it works. It works for what I need it for.
9013260	9022260	I know, but when you're not trying to shill, not trying to shill, when you step into 10, you're going to be like, why haven't I not done this before?
9022260	9030260	Uh, maybe. I'll be more like, everything is different in herp derp technology.
9030260	9036260	Well, you have my number. You know you can message me or call me anytime and I'll give you that text support.
9036260	9038260	I know. Anytime about anything?
9038260	9040260	Oh, you know it, baby.
9041260	9043260	Uh, Rob, anything else in your mind tonight?
9043260	9052260	Uh, no, that's it. No, that's basically it. I'm just getting ready for the work week and how we do, you know.
9052260	9056260	Alright, well best of luck. At least you got Halloween this week, so something to mix it up a little.
9056260	9059260	Halloween and three bottles of booze in the freezer.
9059260	9062260	Sounds good. Alright, take care my friend. I'm going to let you go.
9062260	9064260	You too. And Rob, stay fabulous.
9064260	9066260	I always do.
9066260	9068260	That's what I'm talking about, honey.
9068260	9070260	Bye.
9070260	9075260	Alright, I think that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight and we're going to wrap up the show tonight.
9075260	9080260	As we always say though at the end of OLR, if you enjoyed what you heard, please tell a friend or two about the show.
9080260	9087260	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if the voices are here to air out there and spread around the world.
9087260	9092260	So, please help us spread the word of Orange D'Andrea because clearly we're not going away anytime soon.
9093260	9100260	Thank you as always again for listening and participating with the show tonight, whether it was live here at the Voice Gees Network or via our podcast feed.
9100260	9105260	A nice five star review wherever you found this show at a place like iTunes or wherever you're listening to this show.
9105260	9111260	Those go a very long way, so please help us out. We would really appreciate it with some good reviews for OLR.
9112260	9120260	Dark Sakura, thank you for being here tonight. Missed having you live in studio, although many people don't realize you're actually in studio.
9120260	9128260	You're just not here Sunday nights. You're usually here on Friday or something, making some magic with the radio.
9128260	9131260	It was nice to have you here on a Sunday night.
9131260	9137260	It's good to be back. I'm just really kind of tired of how my schedule is working.
9137260	9138260	Yeah, I understand.
9138260	9139260	We'll see what happens.
9139260	9143260	But look at you. You're a career girl and things are moving in the direction you want to.
9143260	9145260	February is when our next change is, so we'll see what happens.
9145260	9148260	Fingers and toes crossed. Well, any final thoughts for our listeners in the meantime?
9148260	9151260	Um, your cat's loud.
9151260	9154260	I know. Did you just hear Alan yelling?
9154260	9155260	Shut up.
9155260	9157260	That's good.
9157260	9161260	I gotta go to the grocery store too to get butter for more cookies.
9162260	9169260	More cookies. My final thought tonight is thank you, Dark Sakura, for the Girl Scout Cookie Thin Mint Coffee.
9169260	9172260	Yes, the moment I saw that, I was like, heck yeah.
9172260	9174260	Fantastic. And just what I needed this evening.
9174260	9175260	Awesome.
9175260	9177260	Last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?
9177260	9183260	My final thought is, I guess I'm going to try to figure out how to install Fourth Mix Plus on my machine this week.
9183260	9190260	And I'm going to work on my step mania setup to also get that installed at some point.
9190260	9199260	And then, um, follow me on Twitch. Twitch.tv slash Loki O-L-R.
9199260	9200260	Alright.
9200260	9203260	So we can get that affiliate status for some reason.
9203260	9204260	For biddies.
9204260	9205260	For biddies, I guess.
9205260	9207260	They just gave it to me for no reason.
9207260	9208260	Because you're special.
9208260	9212260	But I'll be streaming tomorrow, hopefully. Yeah, I've been trying to stream every day.
9212260	9218260	Like, Friday, this is my, I guess I'm just not used to, because I've been playing more difficult songs.
9218260	9223260	I've been playing heavy songs, which I may cut back on that a little bit, because I've been failing a lot of that shit.
9223260	9230260	Because especially doing, like, I'm not used to playing for like an hour straight playing, you know, heavy non-stop songs.
9230260	9232260	Because it's four songs in a row, just non-stop.
9232260	9240260	Like in the other day, I had like, hey, it's Paranoid Evolution, followed by somewhat of an easier song, followed by, you know, um.
9240260	9242260	Oh god, what the fuck was it?
9242260	9247260	It was, um, some other fucking hard Fifth Mix song.
9247260	9254260	Um, so I was just like, okay, I can't, like, I literally feel like my heart's gonna explode at some point.
9254260	9258260	So not to die on stream, I have to stop what I'm doing.
9258260	9259260	Good call.
9259260	9260260	You know.
9260260	9262260	But, so, let me kick it back a little bit easier.
9262260	9265260	But, Fourth Mix, you know, there's gonna be plenty to go through.
9265260	9270260	Um, I don't know if I'll have it installed tomorrow, but, um, I'll read up on it.
9270260	9272260	I still have to burn the disc for it, so.
9272260	9282260	Well, actually, I technically have Fourth Mix, I think I actually have a legit Fourth Mix, plus I have almost all the mixes in a box next to the machine that you can't see off-screen.
9282260	9286260	But, um, I could probably reinstall those, but.
9286260	9287260	Alright.
9287260	9288260	Superdisc.
9288260	9289260	Alright, uh, that's it.
9289260	9293260	We're gonna see you in seven days, and we'll do this all over again with another episode of OLR.
9293260	9297260	Until then, happy gaming, have a safe week, and don't be a dick to people online.
