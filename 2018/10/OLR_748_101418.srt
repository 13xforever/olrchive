00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This week, Microsoft's cloud grows larger as they announce a streaming service that lets you play Xbox games, joining in the list of an ever increasing number of services past and present.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's just one story in another week of gaming news. Stay tuned for so much more, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 748 for this October the 14th of 2018.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My name is Rob Roberts, here in studio with you, and joining me as always, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hello.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hi, Loki.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hi.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers, she is still off due to work conflicts. She'll be joining us a little later in the show for the Classic Game of the Week.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Before we went on air tonight, Loki, we were talking a little bit, reminiscing a bit about laser tag, which I know is one of your favorite things to discuss.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It is.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So, and the reason why this topic came up is that one of my buddies in Ingress mentioned that there's a new laser tag place that just opened up by, like a lot of the crew here in Ingress will meet up at that restaurant.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And I can't remember the name, I shouldn't say on air either, because I don't want to give away anywhere I live.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But there's a restaurant thing, and there's a lot of portals there, slash pokestops, so if you play that, that works too.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So a lot of times we kind of meet up there to, you know, build a bot for gear and eat, you know, and that whole stuff.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So right, I guess right around the corner or whatever from there is some new laser tag place. It's like two stories, the biggest one in Sacramento, I guess.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And I was like, oh, this sounds up Loki's alley, actually.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But you didn't know, you didn't know about this thing.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:01,000
They're not Cuzar, though, in that stealing bad thing. Like, I keep playing, was it, I've been, my kids like going to play laser tag at Golf Land in Roseville, so.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's too bad.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And it's laser runners, the system that they have there.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Have they changed that laser tag since like 97 when that place opened?

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The guns have been updated, because the old guns look like they used to be just like some piece of foam with like electrical tape wrapped around them.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I like swear to God, they were just electrical tape and just like a tiny little laser pointers surrounded with duct tape.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And it was, I think they've added sensors to the guns, too, because like they used to be able to just like duck behind a wall and just keep your gun out and just shoot everybody because there's no sensors on the gun.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So you can just get away with that.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Now, for the listeners that don't know, like you were like, I don't want to say you were pro with laser tag, but you were like, like, if that was a thing that people streamed on Twitch, you would be like a well-known player.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I would bet anything at this point.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I played over 2000 games of Qsar.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's amazing.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I got a job there just to play more Qsar.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Briefly.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's the life, though.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It sucked, but there's lots of free games.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's minimum wage, but you have free games and that more than paid for.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, it's minimum wage plus you aren't spending the money on the games.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So did you have to be like the marshal that was protecting?

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So what was like the craziest stupid thing that you ever saw go down in a game that you like had like step in and go, sir, don't do that.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't remember anything really out like that is crazy.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We did have to come in one time because they had rented the place out for a rave like the night before.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And so, like, it was a mess.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Like, so, like, we did they keep the walls up for the maze and everything they had to raise?

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah, they basically like everybody would pay to go in to play laser tag, but they wouldn't play laser tag because they're tripping on stuff and just like staring at the lights in the smoke.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And so apparently I didn't get to actually see it because I know, you know, there was a cuddle puddle in the enemy base.

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
No, the cuddle puddle was actually in the what the hell game was that?

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It was because if y'all what's the Atari game that like the big one, they get to sit like the cockpit and like it's vector tanks and stuff.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What was that zone?

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes, it was in battle zone.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The cuddle was in your cockpit.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Was in battle zone.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No, no, no, it wasn't about them.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm sorry, we didn't have battles that we had T-MEC.

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It was T-MEC that they were OK.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm just for those of you that like never been to a rave like I went to a couple in college.

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
OK, those were the years like I was in college.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And hard driving, I believe hard driving had some action too.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
There was a lot of people at raves that would be on, you know, substances like ecstasy that heightened a lot of senses.

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So it'd be very common to see people just kind of like cuddling because that was, you know, that's what those things do to you.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So that's what a cuddle puddle was basically.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So anyway.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah, so T-MEC and hard driving.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So anyway, so so this mess had gone on at the rave and you were just you guys were just like, yeah, we got that.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We were a cleanup crew the next morning. So that kind of thing.

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Thankfully, when we got there, most of the stuff has been done is just, you know.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah, it's a mess. Like you have to sweep up all the cocaine. It's unfortunate, probably.

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah. So it was just yeah.

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
There wasn't anything really too crazy. I don't. Nothing that really stands out.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So, OK, but yeah, I mean, we had a lot of a lot of times where the smoke set off the fire alarms.

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh, that was, you know, usually like the fake dry ice of the dry.

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, I don't like that stuff. They're fake smoke. Like, I'm not like allergic to the fog machines or whatever, but I just like that.

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's when I inhale, like I'm sitting in a theater that uses it for a performance.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I was like, oh, I think it's just like I seriously miss it because that was like one of the best laser tag systems I've ever played with.

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
They have some nearby, but they're not.

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I say there's one in Concord because we were driving.

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's called the entertainment zone there, but they have Cuzar there.

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And then there's one that's in Stars, which is a bowling alley in Vacaville.

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But both I think the Concord ones kept up a little bit better and they have a lot of music games and stuff there.

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So that's pretty cool. But it's like it's that's a good hour and a half hour drive.

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You know, it's it's pretty long, long time to get there.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
They have theirs, but there's a ton of laser tag places nearby.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I haven't found one that's been good.

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah, I hear you.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Nothing to that level of Cuzar.

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Let me let me say hi to our chatters, because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network.

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
VOG Network dot com. That's VOG Network dot com.

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And you can join us if you do happen to be listening live.

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Come on in our chat room over at live dot vog network dot com.

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Our pal Bobby Black Wolf, who's on before us, says, I knew the Marshall speech at Cuzar.

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I was an addict there. I actually gave the briefing a couple times.

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Awesome. We should totally play. I hope I don't know if they have any arenas left.

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
There's not many left because Cuzar went under.

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I think they got bought back up there like in the UK now, but it's not like the original owners or anything.

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And there's not many around there. They're not really producing new equipment, I don't think.

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Well, you know, a lot of these type of places are coming back and entertainment places are becoming more and more popular is because

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
things like Sears, Macy's, Kmart, these types of things are going under.

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And so it's like there's only so many types of things that can fill in that space.

101
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You see a lot of gyms. I know in my neck of the woods, gyms are very popular.

102
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
In Southern California, like medical groups, large medical offices are going in a lot of places where grocery stores are.

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But like entertainment, like that's how we're getting around one in Roseville.

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The very first Cuzar that I played in was probably one of the coolest ones.

105
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And speaking about taking up places that used to have something else, my favorite one was in San Jose.

106
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It was near the East Ridge Mall and it was underground because it was in an old like Jiffy Lube or something like that.

107
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So with our stockroom that was underground was where the arena was.

108
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Because I remember we walked in there like, well, this building's not big enough to have an arena.

109
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Where the hell's the arena for this thing?

110
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And my friend's like, it's downstairs. I'm like, oh, there's a downstairs.

111
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And they actually had two arenas that were next to each other.

112
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And then when it was slow, they'd open the thing in the middle and it would just be this super huge arena.

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Oh shit, that sounds fun.

114
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
They had this like giant bunker in the middle.

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Ah, good times.

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Good times.

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That reminds me of the, I mean, it's the throwback episode of OLR.

118
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That reminds me of this miniature golf place we had in town called the Mineshaft.

119
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You've got to remember that back from the heyday, right?

120
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Where it's kind of like you look at the golf course outside and you're like, it looks big, but not that big.

121
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But it's because it started underground.

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And that's why they called it the Mineshaft.

123
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You would go underground in the basement for like the first five holes.

124
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And it had that whole little like cave theme.

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And then you go upstairs and that's it.

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I think that place is like an RV shop now or something.

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It was a huge building.

128
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Oh no, it's a haunted house right now.

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Because there's advertisements everywhere.

130
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

131
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It is.

132
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Heartstoppers!

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah, yeah, that's, that's, I forgot.

134
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's the time of year for that.

135
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's the other thing all those grocery stores turn into are the limited time Halloween shops.

136
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Lots of miniature golf courses turning into haunted houses.

137
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:09,000
There's also the one that was behind the old mall that we have over here where now it's like police storage slash perpetual haunted house run down piece of crap, you know.

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But it's interesting how, you know, and this is something that's going to be, I know this isn't directly about video games, but in a way it's still like the entertainment and everything.

139
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And because of the fact you're probably buying more of your video games online and you're going, not necessarily just amazon.com, but even using like walmart.com or bestbuy.com.

140
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I think a lot of you are probably, or just buying your games digitally as a lot of people are doing.

141
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And I think because less people are going to, you know, places like Sears.

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I remember my Nintendo came from Sears.

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But like you don't think of Sears as a video game shop anymore, right?

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
My, when I say my Nintendo, my NES back then.

145
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Your GameCube came from Circuit City.

146
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Right? And these, these places don't really exist anymore.

147
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But you know, these other types of shop and it's only going to be even different in like 10 years.

148
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Like what? It's in the headlines right now.

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Speaking of Sears, they're looking at bankruptcy protection and they're going to probably close half their stores.

150
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The one nearby me already closed down.

151
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It already went under.

152
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Which is the one that I got my NES at when I was like nine years old. Crazy.

153
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's a big empty, that whole mall is just on borrowed time.

154
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yeah.

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah. Anyway, it's interesting. It's interesting to see how that all go.

156
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Anyway, go into chat at live.vognetwork.com.

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
SJ100Matt points out there is a QZR in Long Island.

158
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Glow in the dark mini golf places are also on the rise.

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah, that's like the Monster Golf out by the mine shaft.

160
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yeah, lots of entertainment places there opening up.

161
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I mean, it's kind of like a boom again, but I don't know.

162
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah. I would think a lot of those types of places are so hit and miss too, but.

163
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
They are sometimes, but like it's birthday parties. I mean, it gets to drive it.

164
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Or did you hear about, uh, in San Jose, I mean a little bit of a drive,

165
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
but surely at some point in your life, you went to the Valco mall in San, right?

166
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Right. Coopty. It's like, it's like I used to live in San Jose.

167
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay. It's like across the street from Apple's new building, right?

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The Valco mall. Bye bye. They're bulldozing it. Bye bye.

169
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It went under and it's going to be condos.

170
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I was going to say more Apple more, no more housing,

171
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
more housing for the employees at that Apple building.

172
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So which is that big, that fancy one that looks like a glass spaceship or whatever.

173
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Anyway, it is a spaceship.

174
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's, they're just not telling me that.

175
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
All right. Uh, we should get into some other gaming.

176
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So I mean, it's kind of interesting to talk about these retail shops

177
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and things we do in our spare time. Some of y'all I'm sure have memories too,

178
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
but let's get into, we are looking at the future a little bit.

179
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And I think for our kickoff topic tonight,

180
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
this might be a little look at the future of what gaming might be.

181
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I mean, we, this is kind of a follow up, right?

182
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Loki, we've talked about this before.

183
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So, you know, Microsoft, um, there'd been rumors that they've been launching

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
a, some sort of streaming service that's going to go along with the Xbox one,

185
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
perhaps like even just a streaming only console or a digital, you know,

186
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
console without a drive.

187
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Well, apparently now they've started talking about Project X cloud.

188
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's going to be a streaming service that allow you to stream Xbox one games

189
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
to computers, phones, and tablets.

190
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And basically they said with Project X cloud,

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
our goal is to deliver quality experience for all gamers on all devices

192
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
that is consistent with speed and high fidelity gamers experience

193
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and expect on their PC and consoles.

194
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So yeah, I mean, cool.

195
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I wonder if this is the future of gaming is going to be more of this streaming stuff,

196
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
you know, processing in the cloud, whatever you want to call it on like a supercomputer.

197
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So that way you're just looking, you know, as well.

198
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I know we talked about this a little bit last week because, you know,

199
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
we have, uh, somebody brought up like the issue of latency and all that,

200
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
but that's just going to improve as technology.

201
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah. And apparently, well, my thought was like needed like a really huge, um,

202
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
bit of bandwidth to do this, but apparently it's not, not as large as I thought.

203
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And they're even seen to help with mitigate some of this stuff.

204
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
They're actually installing these special servers in data centers,

205
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
which are basically Xbox ones, um, just multiple Xbox ones in there.

206
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So they're going to be, um, doing that as well to kind of help with this,

207
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
but it's pretty funny. And then along with that, you know, we have,

208
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
was it Project Stream, which is the Android or the, um,

209
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Google service that you've been able if you like signed into it, the beta,

210
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
they have the Assassin's Creed Odyssey, um, trial that you can do.

211
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So you can actually play Assassin's Creed Odyssey in your Google Chrome

212
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
browser. Um, which is kind of cool. I did not sign into that,

213
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
but thought about it.

214
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Now, uh, looking at chat at live.vognetwork.com,

215
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Rage Nator says one word on live. And then of course,

216
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I think about the Phantom. Remember the Phantom console?

217
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Because I thought that was a big way that that was supposed to work too,

218
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
was going to be a lot of like in the cloud processing or what have you.

219
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So it's, it's kind of weird to think that maybe some of these companies

220
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
were just like way ahead of their time in a way that, you know,

221
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and we've talked about this in more rural parts of the country,

222
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
like, you know, Alaska or heck,

223
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
even just like rural parts of here in California that aren't the big cities,

224
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
you know, maybe they don't have the internet to support this.

225
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And back in like 2003, 2004,

226
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
we were talking about the Phantom more commonly.

227
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
They certainly weren't that, but now again, internet's getting faster.

228
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Internet's getting better.

229
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Like just here in this past couple of weeks here in SAC where we live,

230
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
they just started rolling out that 5g service. You know what that means?

231
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You get cable fast internet through the air,

232
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
no more cable internet without the cable. That's 5g. Yeah.

233
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So that's starting here. Now we sadly at OLR studios,

234
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
we don't have that because technically I don't live in the downtown area,

235
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
which is where all of this is being kind of piloted, but it's coming.

236
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's downtown now. What's it going to look like in five years? You know,

237
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
at least it's Sacramento and not San Francisco because that's a little bit

238
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
further to go. Well, I'm sure they're getting some form of it too,

239
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
but the reason why they pay, and I know Sacramento isn't the only city,

240
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
they're doing a handful of cities,

241
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
but one of the reasons why they picked Sacramento is that the city kind of

242
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
welcomed it. The city was like, Oh,

243
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
you want to put devices on all these telephone poles? Sure. Go for it.

244
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Like the city really welcomed it. Whereas I'm sure in San Francisco,

245
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
there's a lot of red tape.

246
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I think that comes a lot of stuff that you want to do there.

247
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So it was just like easier to try it here, you know? So.

248
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Is it an olive branch because of the throttling of services for our

249
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
firefighters? That's a much more complicated issue. I don't feel.

250
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'll tell you what, you know, you just forget about the whole throttling thing.

251
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
We'll just give you a 5g in Sacramento. Uh, nifty in chat says,

252
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
but what about Comcast data caps? Special plans for gamers.

253
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I think those data caps are going to have to give to larger data caps.

254
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
As the average consumer consumes more data.

255
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Like why do the data caps exist in the first place right now? I mean,

256
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
easy moneymaker, I guess, but I,

257
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I get the sense that one of the reasons why those were put into place in the

258
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
beginning was to try to kind of curb piracy a little bit.

259
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It was kind of an answer to BitTorrent in some ways is that if you leave your

260
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
BitTorrent running all the time and you're uploading these, you know,

261
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
one or two gigabyte episodes of game of thrones pretty quickly,

262
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
that's going to really eat away at your bandwidth. And so this was one way I,

263
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
that was always kind of part of the, I mean, don't get me wrong.

264
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah. I mean, don't get me wrong.

265
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
There's some of this whole more and more people are cutting the cord and

266
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
getting rid of their television altogether. We have to make money somehow.

267
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But like,

268
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I know a lot of people downtown that are thinking of dropping Comcast and

269
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
switching to Verizon to get the 5g like that is,

270
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
that's where the competition is going to go is like,

271
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
how fast can you get me my internet? How good and clean and, and you know,

272
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
uh, without noise,

273
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
can you get my internet so I can stream video games or do whatever I want to do?

274
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I would love to have competition in my neighborhood, you know,

275
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and I have Verizon for my phone, which is, yeah, it's all right.

276
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I get discount through work.

277
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Hopefully it's still get discount through the 5g,

278
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
which I think it would because they actually were at our work for a vendor

279
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
fair type thing. And I talked to him, I'm like, yeah,

280
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm looking for that 5g coming in. He's like, hi, yo, me too.

281
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Cause the guy is like, didn't quite live in Sacramento. Yeah. But, um,

282
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
hopefully soon. But I would, yeah, drop them in the heartbeat.

283
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So back to the topic at hand where I really wanted to go with this discussion

284
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
because I think we need to kind of have a serious look at this,

285
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
especially when we're talking about things like PlayStation five next box,

286
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
whatever they end up doing there. Uh, and heck even Nintendo.

287
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I mean, we've kind of blinked and missed it sort of thing, but,

288
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and probably because this is more prevalent in Japan,

289
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I think they released one of them here, but not the other,

290
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
but Japan has that resident evil seven and Assassin's Creed Odyssey because

291
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
they're running, they're streaming.

292
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That's how they're getting the powerful games to run on the switch.

293
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
They're streaming them. So kind of those LOL.

294
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Nintendo is under power to run stuff may not last much longer.

295
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I think there's a very big potential Nintendo's next system.

296
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I mean, I think, well, they're going to stay invested in the switch for a good

297
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
long time, but Nintendo may be the first, if anybody to be like,

298
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
not everything is going to be this streaming thing because it's the way that

299
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
we can deliver like huge technology, but not pass on that cost to you.

300
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I think the streaming thing is good to a point, but like right now,

301
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
like I can't, I don't think we're going to be able to stream 4k gameplay.

302
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You're like, you're not going to get Xbox one X quality gameplay streaming.

303
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You're not going to get that.

304
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But you know, if you just want Xbox one type gameplay,

305
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
then those visuals, you probably could do that.

306
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's just, I don't think, I don't think it's going to be as good as the console,

307
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
but it'll definitely fill gaps for like some consoles that are under powered

308
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
that could run some of these games in that way.

309
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's another way to deliver that to a few more platforms.

310
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Going to chat at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Lackwolf says,

311
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I think now that net neutrality is gone for everywhere but California,

312
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
they could just sell it.

313
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Didn't Washington do something similar anyway,

314
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
but they could just sell you tiers that exempt certain sites in the data cap.

315
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So you'll still have a data cap and under your traffic to Fortnite

316
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and other registered gaming services will count against it for your

317
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
$9.99 extra a month on your bill.

318
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Key term, registered gaming services,

319
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
which means AAA games and not indie games,

320
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
AAA studios will have to pay to be a part of their tier.

321
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I think with the whole net neutrality thing, though,

322
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
you know, without getting too political,

323
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I think one thing we have to remember is that the government works for us.

324
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And when the government swings way too far into special interests,

325
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
which is, you know, they're misinformed by these special interest campaigns

326
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
that are trying to...

327
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
They're not misinformed, they're paid off.

328
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You know what I mean.

329
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Where it's basically guiding their hand to sign off on a lot of these things.

330
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I think you're seeing a lot of people rise up and saying,

331
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I think the fuck not.

332
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And that's why you're seeing this happen at the state level.

333
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Ironically by Verizon, too.

334
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Oh?

335
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah, G-Pi, I think he was with Verizon prior to his current role.

336
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh, well, shock, shock, shock upon shocks.

337
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But I think, again, I think even though, yes,

338
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
that's something that happened at the federal level,

339
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I think you're going to see more and more states,

340
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
especially after what California did,

341
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I think you're just going to see more states pass a similar type of policy

342
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and it'll be the people.

343
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Honestly, like, I see a lot of very tense shit on Twitter, you know,

344
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
when it comes to blue team versus red team.

345
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And I don't really want to get into that right now.

346
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But I think one place where we all kind of come together,

347
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
for the most part, certainly it would have not passed

348
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
if there weren't some people that felt net neutrality was a bad thing.

349
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But I think for the most part, there's a lot of people from the red team

350
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
that would, you know, cross over and say,

351
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
yeah, Ajit did not do a good thing here

352
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
and net neutrality is overall a good thing.

353
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So at least that's the vibe I get on Twitter

354
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
is that most people are on the same page there.

355
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So at least that's one thing I feel like we can kind of get going

356
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
is, you know, striking these things that were signed.

357
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The problem is you have really old people in Congress in the House

358
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
that don't get it.

359
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
They don't understand what the Internet is.

360
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And they don't understand.

361
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Remember when we were in awe.

362
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Like, we were really surprised when, gosh darn it,

363
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I don't, oh, it was the Schwarzenegger versus person law.

364
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm sorry, it was person versus Schwarzenegger.

365
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Somebody on the channel will know the name.

366
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
But it was they struck down that law where they were going to have,

367
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
you had to be 18 or up to buy a game at GameStop.

368
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Remember that whole thing?

369
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But the term, what a mature game was, was too gray.

370
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So that was the problem is that somebody else was basically going to have to tell us

371
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
what was good for us and what was not.

372
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And it ended up getting struck down by the Supreme Court.

373
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And we were all kind of like, whoa,

374
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,000
because in one of the justices things supporting the decision to strike down the law

375
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
talked about how people on their staff played Mortal Kombat

376
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
and all this stuff growing up.

377
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
They had to learn from their legal clerks about what Mortal Kombat was.

378
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I don't want to misplace it, but I want to say it was Justice Kennedy.

379
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Maybe somebody in chat remembers that whole thing and can correct me.

380
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
But that like people on his legal staff had to kind of advise,

381
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
like, you know, guide him a little bit because he didn't know.

382
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And you're right, a lot of people making the laws in this country

383
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
may not necessarily know how a lot of technologies and that stuff works.

384
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Okay, Bobby's correcting me. Thank you.

385
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It was Schwarzenegger versus EMA, then Brown versus EMA by default

386
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
when Jerry Brown became governor, took over for Schwarzenegger.

387
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And they don't seem to, Black Wolf thinks it was Lena Kagan.

388
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And that would make a lot of sense because she would have been the newest justice

389
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
at the time that that was heard because this was heard before

390
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
President 45's latest appointees.

391
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So it was Justice Kagan, I believe, at that time was the youngest on the court.

392
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It may still be if I'm not mistaken, although I'm not sure if the new guy is younger.

393
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
But anyway, all that aside, by the time, you know, we're not getting any younger, Loki.

394
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Our generation, this whole like borderline of Gen X and Millennials,

395
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
the Zillennials, I know some of you hate that term, but deal with it for the moment.

396
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You know, we're going to be approaching that age more and more

397
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
where I think we're going to see ourselves represented more in politics.

398
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You know, and it'll be our generation making some of these rules and stuff.

399
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
This is interesting.

400
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I think that's why they say more and more youth needs to get involved in politics

401
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
because that's the only way these things kind of change.

402
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So I hope you all registered to vote because the deadline passed in some places already.

403
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But hopefully, you know, where you're at, if you're not registered to vote, you can take care of that because

404
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I got my vote, my available forms.

405
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Yeah, me too. Me too.

406
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So anyway, wow, we got on a whole tangent there.

407
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So we got streaming games and then it got it got all political.

408
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Kind of easy to do that this time of year.

409
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It is. Well, because because you're right.

410
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I mean, the concerns are right about things like net neutrality

411
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and the fact that the Comcast and the Verizon of the world can set these rules

412
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
when it comes to data caps and all that stuff.

413
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
That's the big concern a lot of people have when it comes to streaming their games full time

414
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
is, well, what about my data caps and all this stuff?

415
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Because, you know, if you're streaming Netflix in 4K all day long,

416
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
which some people do, you're going to hit those data caps pretty quickly.

417
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Which is funny because like Comcast is literally they have their new box that has Netflix built into it.

418
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
They're advertising, hey, we got Netflix on our box.

419
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
What doesn't have Netflix?

420
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But like I just thought it was funny. It's like, but you're so against that.

421
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm confused. Who are you?

422
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I think in that case, because, you know, Comcast had their own thing.

423
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
They had the stream flicks or whatever that was called stream pics.

424
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I don't know what it's called. I don't even know if it's still stream pics.

425
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But I really think that was a case of if you can't beat them, join them.

426
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And even Netflix can see from where they're sitting, they see Hulu coming in the picture.

427
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
They see CBS. They see Disney. Here comes Disney.

428
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Here comes what WB Warner Brothers just said in the past week.

429
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
They're looking at doing something too. Warner Brothers owns all the Harry Potter movies.

430
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
What? I'm not going to be able to get my CW content anymore? Oh, no.

431
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
No Buffy the Vampire Slayer for you.

432
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Ah, I am disappointed.

433
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Yeah. So I do think it's kind of one of those if you can't beat them, join them type of things.

434
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So, but, uh, Bobby Black Wolf again, very chatty tonight saying that Comcast does state in the fine print that Netflix does count against your data cap.

435
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
That is probably honestly though, that is actually a good thing because that is net neutrality in action.

436
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
If they didn't count Netflix towards your cap, that would not be net neutrality.

437
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Right? So even though it's weird to say, and it might kind of suck, that's actually probably a good thing that Netflix counts against your cap.

438
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Just like any other traffic would count against you or just, you know, get rid of those data caps.

439
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Just like, just like listening to the show. But it's, that's the nice thing of us about us being audio only.

440
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It's so, and even when we go to video, like honestly streaming 720 video is not as bad as you'd think.

441
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Like I would say, like right now we've been streaming for 28 minutes and we've sent out, I'm looking at the counters.

442
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's ticking up. We don't want, I can't even count all the digits. I think we've sent out 20 megabytes of data and that's it.

443
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So it's not that much, all things considered. So it's about a megabyte a minute. Anyway.

444
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
All right. Anyhow, let's, uh, let's move on. Let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

445
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Loki, how was your gaming week? What have you been up to?

446
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I didn't play much. I played, um, Pokemon Go. I played a lot of that. Um, I played Dance Dance Revolution still because I'm doing that.

447
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And someone might, or some people might've been lucky enough to catch my, um, stream on Twitch that I just fucked around with the Twitch mobile app.

448
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I missed it. Am I subscribed? I must not be subscribed on Twitch. I didn't see it.

449
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It's all right. It wasn't worth watching, honestly. It was a test. It was a test. I was just, hey, there's a mobile app on this thing.

450
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
What if I prop my phone up? Let's see how well that works. And just, you know, I didn't even have it plugged in and it died after 30 minutes.

451
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And I, which is fine, but it was just an experiment. However, with that being said, I am going to be streaming on Twitch.

452
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I have gear coming. I have a whole setup that's going to be multi-camera setup plus screen feed.

453
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
You can't do anything half-assed and that's why you never finish a project.

454
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But I've got, I've got it ready to go.

455
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Now I'm excited. What's your Twitch name? Loki OLR?

456
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Yeah, I believe so.

457
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Okay. That's awesome.

458
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So, um, yeah, I'll be doing that. The only thing I don't like so far is, um, and I had this happen with the really crappy stream that I did, um, is the muting of audio because

459
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:15,000
synchronized love. Damn you, Joe, whatever your name is. I don't remember his, the musician's name, but damn you for muting my audio during that portion.

460
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So you are saving your archives because Twitch doesn't do that by default. You have to tell it to.

461
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Yeah, I didn't.

462
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Whoops.

463
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Well, no, it's fine.

464
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
How'd you know it got muted then if you don't save your archives?

465
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I was able to play it back.

466
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Then you're saving your archives. Good job.

467
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Oh, I don't remember doing that.

468
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yeah.

469
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Cool.

470
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I would always turn that on by default anyway. Um, but yeah, well, I mean, I can imagine with DDR there's going to be copyrighted songs if you talk over it because like, like I've played Forza and somehow gotten away with it, but I talk a lot.

471
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
But it wasn't even like direct audio. It was on a phone across the room.

472
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It doesn't matter. You know how YouTube can detect that shit. It's, it's, they use something similar to what like Shazam and those types of apps. Is that the big one Shazam?

473
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Yeah.

474
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:09,000
But they, they sound hound, I don't know what they're called, but they, they listen in a similar manner so that you can tell what song is playing. Those similar technology to what operates those apps.

475
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Yeah. So, um, I did get, for my DDR machine, I did get replacement CD drive.

476
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Tiger Claw found your video in like three seconds.

477
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Yeah.

478
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
But only part of it is muted.

479
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Yeah. Well, it's part of it and only part of it was muted and it sucks too because like apparently my, well, I just did this on a whim, like I didn't actually prep for it.

480
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So I plugged in my phone, my phone had already, it was down to like 30% anyways. I'm like, eh, it should last long enough for this.

481
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And then my laptop, you know, eats through battery like any, like nothing. So I didn't have that plugged in either. So I couldn't tell, you know, in fact, I think the last bit that before it cut out, I'm like, oh, my laptop's dead.

482
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:57,000
You know, cause the battery had gone dead on that. Um, but you know, I actually did play max 300, uh, only on difficult and I did pass it.

483
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I was like, oh, cool. And then I was like, oh, it's dead. Oh, no one saw that. Oh, well, but that's fine.

484
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Um, but yeah, I'm going to hopefully do that. So then like I said, I got replacement optical drive for my DDR machine so I can do the super disk if I want to and put other mixes on there.

485
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Um, I haven't decided if I'm going to do that yet. I am seriously considering a setup with a step mania machine as well.

486
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
But what I'm actually gonna do a little bit differently with that is I'm going to have it toggleable.

487
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
So it's going to be, I can flip between step mania machine and arcade hardware when I want to.

488
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
That sounds like a project.

489
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It's actually not, it doesn't seem like it's going to be that hard. It's just, you know, some, uh, splicing of stuff.

490
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:52,000
But for now, just, you know, DDR, I am trying to figure out what songs are going to be flaggable on Twitch. I guess live wise, it doesn't matter.

491
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Yeah, it doesn't matter if you're focusing on live. It doesn't matter. I mean, you just, you just have to realize if you're playing a song that really hinges on the music, you're going to probably get muted.

492
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Like a lot of music games are going to do this too. If well, like, you know, not like a, um, you know, like the dance mania stuff. Yeah.

493
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Yeah. Yeah. If you, if you play things that are big on licensed music, like guitar hero, rock band. Yeah.

494
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You know, you're going to get muted because those songs are going to trigger it. So, you know, it's a live only type of thing.

495
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And DDR is just kind of the same thing.

496
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Yeah. So I'll be doing that, um, you know, as part of my exercise each day.

497
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So I'm going to try to push it a little longer and maybe not walk as much during the day so that I actually have energy to do it.

498
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Um, so yeah, so look forward to that sometime soon.

499
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I just have to get it all set up and test some things. So you may see some test streams, but yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.

500
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And I think the cameras are coming tomorrow, so I'm, I can't wait.

501
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Neat. Um, my gaming week, uh, not, not too thrilling, uh, because I was playing world of Warcraft a bit and working on a new character.

502
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So I got my Horde Druid up to 120 and now I'm working on an Alliance Monk.

503
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So I'm just kind of, uh, slogging away at that. And I think I've hit level 48, but you know, that's without spending an awful lot of time on it.

504
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:14,000
So that's pretty cool. So I'm happy with the progress there, but otherwise I haven't been playing a lot of otherwise like console stuff and things.

505
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Um, a little bit of Forza. I do remember dabbling in Forza a little bit, but, um, keep in mind part of my week, Delvin, who was here on the show last week,

506
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:32,000
he was still here. So we went up to Reno on Monday and I was trying so hard to find him a killer instinct machine because he hasn't played on an actual killer instinct arcade machine in forever.

507
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And I thought, Oh, maybe that classic arcade row at Peppermill. Cause you know, Peppermills, I was like, I thought maybe they would have one.

508
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:46,000
They didn't, but they did have that new Ninja Turtles game. So yes, I took a picture of that and put it on Twitter. And so golf land.

509
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Oh, do they really? Yeah. Did you play it? I haven't. I didn't get a chance to play it cause some other kids were,

510
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,000
and I was just kind of like watching, but it definitely kind of rings true of the old school one. Yeah.

511
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I haven't gotten to like it. The problem is like my kids don't have the attention span. Like they, they want to do other things. And so like, Oh hey, let's play Ninja Turtles.

512
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I'll play something that spits out tickets. I want to play the candy claw machine. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Of course. Candy claw.

513
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Um, so yeah. So, um, actually if, if casino games count as a video games, which they might, they might as well be, it's, it's what Konami does now.

514
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Y'all can, I mean, does casino games. Well anyway, so I like to play slot machines a little bit. I'll set myself a limit and, you know, say this is how much I'm going to waste on slot machines today.

515
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:38,000
But anyway, long story short, I went to a wheel of fortune machine that was just on some classic, you know, sevens and bars type of thing.

516
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I put the max credit in, put, uh, pulled the thing and it came up on the wheel and it spun the wheel and I won 500 credits. So it was quarters.

517
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:55,000
So ended up being 125 bucks. I love the wheel of fortune machines. Yeah. So that was it. And after that I was like done.

518
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So I was very proud of myself for kind of like walking away. Um, but I did also, so this is also funny cause it's play, it's like Vegas dreams IRL.

519
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Did y'all ever play Vegas dreams on the super Nintendo? Cause I love that game. We went, it was dead. Reno was dead on Monday because of course it's a Monday.

520
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It's a weekday even though it was Columbus day or whatever. I guess nobody really has the day off except maybe banks in the States. So, uh, the casinos were dead.

521
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:31,000
So like the thing that kind of crossed Delvin and I's mind was that if we go up to play a table game, they can actually like kinda interact with us.

522
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Like we wouldn't, you know how like with blackjack, you don't want to go play blackjack when you don't know what you're doing cause you'll fuck it up for everybody else at the table.

523
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I don't know if you know that, but that's like a thing. If you like hit when you're not supposed to in blackjack, you can, you can like take somebody else's 10 basically and like screw it up.

524
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:58,000
So, um, so I didn't play blackjack, but we played roulette for the first time. So this is just a funny side story. Delvin was like learning about like, kind of like, cause I guess you have to do like a $5 minimum bet.

525
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You can spread it out on the inside or you can do it all on one thing on the outside. So the lady was kind of teaching us how to place. So I watched him go through like $20 and then I was like, you know what, I'll play, I'll play for fun.

526
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:19,000
So I put my things down and I put $2 on my mom's birthday, the month in the year, or I'm sorry, the month of the day. And then I put $1 on my birthday, the 26th.

527
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Well, guess what? Roulette number came up 26. So I won like 35 bucks or whatever. And I was like, done. That was my one and only game of roulette. Like, cause it's not going to happen to me twice in a row.

528
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:43,000
That was my one and only game of roulette I ever played. So that was kind of fun. Anyway, uh, SSU100Matt in our chat over at live.avag.net.com says, uh, yeah, $125 more money than you've had before.

529
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Well, in a way, Matt, that was kind of Reno paying me back for all the money it's taken from me in the past. So, you know, and while it's a nice sum of money, don't get me wrong.

530
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It's not that much money. Like it pretty much, it paid for dinner and gas by then it's like, oh, money's gone. But it was nice. It's nice to have the trip to Reno, I guess, on the house, uh, that way. So we had a good time.

531
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Um, trying to think of like other, we walked around to some of the arcades, but it's just, it's so sad how the vast majority of arcades are all like, just take any DDR machines to be found.

532
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:29,000
No, believe it or not. No, like a wheat check. Cause we were looking for the killer instinct machine circus circus has a whole new area. What used to be the ice cream shop is all like a subsidiary arcade.

533
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Now, no DDR machine in there or anything like it. No, like, like in the groove or anything like that. Uh, nothing at Harris, none of it. Peppermill didn't have it. Huh? Maybe, you know, maybe I just went to the wrong casino.

534
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Somebody's probably listening to the show going, I live in Reno. It's over here. Well, we just missed it. I guess it happens. So I used to love the silver legacies buffet.

535
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I love casino buffets. That's like my guilty pleasure. Yeah. It's so, uh, so much crap, but it's, it's so much garbage, but it's good. It's a buffet. What do you expect?

536
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Well, I'm going to Vegas in November, so there won't be an OLR, uh, November or may actually I might be back in time for it. I don't know. We'd be pushing it a little bit. It was like November 19th or something around that day.

537
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:20,000
There's not going to be an OLR because I'm going to final fantasy fan fest for final fantasy 14, where they'll undoubtedly announce the next expansion that's in Vegas.

538
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And, um, so, uh, yeah, probably we'll go to some of the Vegas buffets and all that stuff when I go, go down there for ironically a video game related convention.

539
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So anyway, that's my gaming week, pretty much like world of Warcraft and just a few other things here and there. And that's, that's really it forza. That's it watching some Twitch, but not a lot of, uh, otherwise game, but just focusing on that.

540
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Um, I started another one of my reality games on Facebook, at least this time I can talk about it. Uh, it's not the whole thing in secret. So there actually might be because some of them heard about my show.

541
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:02,000
So, Hey, if y'all are listening, uh, but, um, yeah, so I know that's going to be another time sink as well, but those are more like social types of games. I really kind of parallel it to D and D.

542
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Not everybody agrees with me, but D and D is like a very social thing. That's what these are. They're social games. So anyway, let's get into some gaming news. We'll start it off with the first news story. Loki.

543
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Yep. So this is another game that probably got the pickup, even though I've been bad about playing the VR games that I have purchased on the PlayStation four, but this is pretty cool.

544
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Borderlands two VR is going to be coming to the PlayStation VR in December 14th. It's a retooled version of Borderlands two. And apparently they have a new mechanic called Banff time or badass mega fun time, which I guess slows down everything, allows people to dodge bullets and do other cool stuff.

545
00:38:48,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Um, of course driving is first person now and the weapons, uh, weapons are controlled, I guess, by head movement. And they're saying that, um, you can also choose between the standard controller movement or the point to point teleportation.

546
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So neat. I'm curious to see what other cool stuff you could do in this, but I don't know. So I'll probably pick it up because I'm a sucker for that crap.

547
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:31,000
So let me play through Skyrim. Um, I really, I needed like what I needed is I need to move my whole setup away from where I'm at. Hey, that's actually speaking of this whole streaming thing.

548
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So one of the thoughts I had was, you know, for the channel is basically calling the thing Loki's garage because it is literally in my garage, but I may end up moving some of my gaming stuff out into the garage because then I can actually play it and talk without interrupting everybody or being annoying.

549
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So I may end up sticking with that for other games other than DDR as well.

550
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:02,000
You should look at trying to like insulate the garage a little bit so that it's like tolerable. Well, in the winter it'll be more tolerable. And then like trying to, um, I don't know how you would soundproof.

551
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
No, not necessarily soundproof, but try to like, uh, for the, for the summer to not get it so fricking hot in there.

552
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Uh, yeah, insulation, but the walls do not have insulation in them. I know that for a fact and the roof. Yeah, it would just be, I would like to have it insulate so it's not 115 degrees in the summer.

553
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Because Loki's garage will be fun in the winter, but in the summer it's not going to be fun. Summer is not fun. I play DDR in the summer. I will still play DDR in the summer, but it is not. It is opening the garage door and it's sweating your balls off.

554
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Uh, let's see. So, uh, Cajudo in chat says, I'm down for Borderlands VR. Yeah. You know what I thought was interesting about this is that this kind of reminded me, weren't we expecting like Borderlands 3 by now?

555
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Like shouldn't that have been a thing at this year's E3, but I guess it's just maybe it's just not fully done yet. So this is, this is, you got rage too. That's pretty close.

556
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I guess this is kind of the crumbs we're getting to hold us over VR port. Although I want a new Borderlands game. I feel like border.

557
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I love and played through the pre-sequel though. So technically I do have a new Borderlands game I haven't played yet.

558
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I feel like, uh, uh, Borderlands 2 is like all of a sudden back again cause like I've seen more and more people streaming it.

559
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Like our buddy Travis Donovan is trying to get more and more involved in Twitch. So shout out for his channel.

560
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
But he's been playing some Borderlands 2 and I'm kind of like, well this is a throwback. I haven't seen this game in a while.

561
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Cause that game came out a while ago at this point, Borderlands 2.

562
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Yes, it's been out for a long time, but it's a great game.

563
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Yeah, no, it is. It'll be interesting to try it again in VR, I think. Play it all over again.

564
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So, uh, let's see. Dungeon buster and chat says they're working on it, but I'm guessing they don't have anything to show for Borderlands 3.

565
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,000
So it just wasn't ready to go yet. Maybe next year or maybe they're going to sit on it for the next consoles. Who knows?

566
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Cause now that's a question we have to start asking. Or no, no, Borderlands 3 will come out on this round of consoles and then they'll have the definitive edition on the new consoles.

567
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Wait, oh god. Borderlands Battle Royale? How dare you. Don't even plant that idea in their heads. Alright.

568
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, butter.

569
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Well, um, you know, hey, for Battle Royale games, cross platform is all the rage, right?

570
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So, uh, you know, one question we asked when we heard that Fortnite was going to go cross platform was how long until the other games go cross platform?

571
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:31,000
And Blizzard, uh, was one company that we were all looking at for Diablo, you know, and Diablo is going to be coming out on the Switch.

572
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Well, interesting, there's been a little bit of back and forth on this this week.

573
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:51,000
So apparently there was a rep that actually was being interviewed talking a little bit about cross play in Diablo 3 who responded that it's not a question of when, sorry, it's a question of when, not if.

574
00:42:51,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Basically leading us to go like, oh shit, they're going to put cross play in Diablo 3 so that would be great cause you can play the Switch and the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One and who knows, maybe there'd be a way to kind of link to PC.

575
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And I thought, I kind of thought this was really exciting news as well, or this statement was very exciting because this may mean that, okay, well if it's cross play, then it may not necessarily go through Nintendo servers and whatever.

576
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:24,000
It's going to go through battle net. So maybe, I mean, think of it this way, you could chat with somebody playing World of Warcraft from your Nintendo Switch when you're in Diablo, right?

577
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:34,000
That would make sense how that might work, right? Well, unfortunately, that was the news a couple days ago, but Blizzard came out after that and said, I don't think so.

578
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:48,000
So there's a second comment from a Blizzard rep that said, while we love the idea of bringing our players together across platforms, we do not have any plans to implement cross platform gameplay for Diablo at this time.

579
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Now, some are reading into this a bit, is that maybe Blizzard doesn't want to commit to this. They don't want to say it's going to happen because they haven't been testing it, they haven't been doing anything in Nintendo, they don't want to let anybody down.

580
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Or, if they want to unveil this, they're going to wait for Blizzcon to do it. So there's still some wishful thinking going into this statement. Is that kind of one of those, well they didn't say not ever, just that they're not announcing it right now.

581
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
But, who knows.

582
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Here's what they're waiting to see.

583
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Don't expect it out the gate. Do not buy Diablo 3 on Switch expecting that it'll be cross platform. That is something that's very important.

584
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Now, speaking of companies and cross platform, I think this is a good chance to say something about another company that does a lot of publishing on all these different systems, and that would be Bethesda.

585
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:53,000
So Bethesda is looking at doing more cross play. In fact, in a quote, they were doing an interview with Eurogamer, and part of what they said during this Eurogamer was, I'm trying to look at where the specific quote is here, because they actually talked about how cross play would be a really good thing.

586
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:04,000
He says here, I'm most heartened by Sony's news last week about cross play, because it seems they're going to open up and embrace not just cross play, but cross platform progression. Those are two very different things.

587
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I don't want to just be able to play against people on other platforms, I want to be able to take my progress with me from device to device. What I've unlocked my character can do, I want to go from platform to platform.

588
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And both those things I think are equally important, and I'm very much hopeful that with the next gen platforms, we'll see even more of that in terms of treating our fan base as a whole, as opposed to here's the Xbox folks, here's the PS4 folks, here's the Switch folks and PC.

589
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Everybody's segmented and walled off from each other. We can just say you're all playing game X, and we can treat you all the same because your experiences are the same. You're playing against each other.

590
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:50,000
We already know Bethesda's head is kind of in this a little bit. They're not going to do it with Fallout 76, because it's one of those that was already in the planning stages and kind of done before cross play started going everywhere.

591
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:59,000
But we know for their Elder Scrolls game, they flat out came out and said, what's the new one called, the mobile one, but I say mobile, but it's going to be everywhere. It's going to be on Switch, PS4.

592
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
The Elder Scrolls Blades?

593
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Yeah, that's it, Blades. So they come out and said, if you don't support cross platform, you're not getting Blades. So Bethesda kind of put their foot down on this whole thing.

594
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
So they really want, and you know, as somebody, Bethesda being a third party publisher.

595
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
They should also push for better mods in the PlayStation 4 version of Skyrim, but you know.

596
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Might be a little late for that now. I think they're looking ahead.

597
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It's never too late.

598
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Bethesda was self-parry-ing themselves this year when it came to how many fucking versions of Skyrim there are.

599
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I don't think Bethesda's interested in going back and visiting any more Skyrim. I think any talk here on out is going to be Blades, and then eventually Elder Scrolls 6.

600
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
But I would say Elder Scrolls 6 is still quite a ways out.

601
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
There's always room for Oblivion remasters.

602
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Boy oh boy. Alright, anyway.

603
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,000
So it sounds like Bethesda really wants this, and I think, you know, as we get into more and more consoles, that may be very well the way it goes.

604
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Especially if the third parties are putting on a lot of pressure to do that.

605
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And then what else is it going to say with all that?

606
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Is that they're putting a lot of pressure on it, and then, oh, with Forza, I've been playing that, you know, on both Xbox One and PC.

607
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And when they talk about the portability, that is really nice.

608
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:24,000
It is nice. I can do one thing on my PC, and then when it's like, oh, I want to show my friend, so let's play on Xbox One for a little bit, it just, like, picks right up where I left off, essentially.

609
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I mean, in Forza, you kind of start over at your house, but it's the same thing.

610
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
You can restart from where your progress is. Yeah, I need to play more of that, too.

611
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Anyway, there you go. Cross platform and what the future might hold for that.

612
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:46,000
It sounds like third parties are putting a little more pressure on for this to stay the norm, especially going into the next generation of consoles.

613
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
But maybe don't expect it for all your games coming out this year.

614
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Anyhow, moving on, Loki.

615
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Yes, so apparently some PlayStation 4 users are claiming that they're receiving messages that are locking up their consoles.

616
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:13,000
So what they're receiving is basically some user message that can't really be displayed, and then what happens is their controllers and sound output fail, and then basically the console continues with error loops.

617
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
So what can you do to possibly stop this?

618
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Well, there's a few things you can do to kind of prevent the message if you haven't gotten it already.

619
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:26,000
You can basically lock down your privacy settings to only allow friends only or no one to send you messages.

620
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And then if you do happen to run across the message, the other thing you can do is download the PlayStation mobile app, delete it through the app, and then you can also rebuild your database on the PlayStation to fix the error.

621
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
So that's kind of annoying. Hopefully it's something that they address and will patch out.

622
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And most likely it sounds like some sort of characters that can't be displayed or something and the console gets confused.

623
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I don't know. That's stupid.

624
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Well, I don't like, too, that there's a lot of clickbait going around about how this is bricking consoles.

625
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It's locking up.

626
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Yeah, it was brought up on Discord, and I think there was some feedback on Discord like, that headline is really misleading, because if it was bricking your console, you would not be able to use said console ever again.

627
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:25,000
This is more like just a fucking giant inconvenience, which isn't cool, don't get me wrong, but if this happens to your PlayStation 4, don't throw it in the dumpster. It's fixable. It's just really inconvenient.

628
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
And honestly, by the time the workday starts on Monday, I'm pretty sure Sony is well aware of this.

629
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I mean, it just came up with a weekend, so I'm pretty sure you're going to see a patch rolling out probably this week that's going to fix this right up.

630
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:49,000
But I think it's a good reminder for everybody to check your privacy settings, and honestly, unless you have a reason for the public to be sending you messages, turn it off. Have it be your friends only.

631
00:49:49,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I think mine's set to friends only. It might be set to friends of friends, if that's an option, because sometimes I want people to be able to add me if they see we have mutual friends, and they're like, oh, I know that guy.

632
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:12,000
But yeah, it's kind of on lockdown for the general public. And luckily, I have the mobile app. I tend to look at my messages on the mobile app first. So if I got anything funky like this, I'd probably delete it before I ever saw it on my PS4.

633
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Yeah. And with how often I use my PlayStation 4, except for last night when I had to watch the DVD version of A Star is Born from 1970.

634
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Aside from that, I hardly ever get to play my PlayStation 4 anyway, so yeah.

635
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:44,000
So yeah, you know where I get a ton of messages. So this is going to be a big throwback. So if you were here, the night that Orange Lounge Radio, the very last night of Orange Lounge Radio, the DDR show before we merged with the podcast.

636
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:54,000
You remember how we used to do it split? We did like an hour long podcast with the live show. It was a split show. Not all of you may know that. If you're new to Orange Lounge Radio, you may not realize there used to be a live only show that was not podcast at all.

637
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And that obviously changed a long time ago. But anyway, I'm bringing that up because if you were here for that very last show, we had a guest named Mistress Tia on that show, who's one of my longest and dearest friends. She's wonderful.

638
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:18,000
She lives in New York City now. Well, this is how long ago that was. Her kid's like 13 or 14 now. And so I get all of these messages on PlayStation because the kid spams the entire friends list talking about fucking Fortnite.

639
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:33,000
And it's all these things. It's like, I didn't ask this, but it's her PlayStation out. So of course we friended each other, but it's her kid obviously monopolizes the PlayStation using her account, sending all these messages about how he's going to kick some dude's ass at Fortnite.

640
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And I'm just kind of laughing. Like it's, I have a good time. I'm not like actually annoyed with it, but I'm just kind of like, Oh my God, stop. Get the kid his own account.

641
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I know I didn't make her show roll, but there was one thing, you know, with the whole Call of Duty Black Ops 4 being now through the Blizzard launcher or whatever. Yeah.

642
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Yeah. I guess what happens when you chat in Call of Duty on PC? Your real name shows up. Fun times.

643
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:11,000
So I went on a little bit of a Twitter rant because that's what we do now in 2018. We Twitter rant because this goes back to Blizzard's shitty implementation of Real ID.

644
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:23,000
And I realized Blizzard has done a lot of great things for PC games. Blizzard has a very diehard community, but even some of the most diehard Blizzard people, like I would die on Blizzard's hill.

645
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Even some of them that I've met through the years that I did a Horde house, the Warcraft show years ago, even many of them that I've met think Real ID is implemented shittily.

646
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:41,000
And when I say shittily, I mean, and I might be making up a word there, but it's a word now. Shittily. It's how Real ID was implemented.

647
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Is that on the Wiki? Shitty implementation. Shittily. Anyway, I say that because it's like Blizzard goes out of their way to make sure you're using your real name on all this stuff.

648
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:10,000
When, you know what, that might not be such a good idea. I realized they did that because they thought they would prevent toxicity, but clearly you're not paying attention to Overwatch if you think this is going to work.

649
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I don't understand why putting your real name on blast in this day and age of everybody streaming, which Blizzard themselves endorses you streaming through Facebook.

650
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Remember, they have a partnership with Facebook. It's right there in the Battle.net app. You can stream right there on Facebook. It defaults to showing your real name.

651
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:42,000
And in this day and age of streaming, like, is that such a good idea? And you might go, well Rob, if you don't want to put it out there, don't fucking stream.

652
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Yeah. Problem with your little snap analysis is that if one of my friends is streaming, I can't do anything about it.

653
00:53:52,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Because the default is to always show your friends real names. So if I send a friend a message who happens to be streaming, oh, I just showed my real name.

654
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And one I didn't get to pick, one that Blizzard took off of my credit card I was using to pay for World of Warcraft without my permission and permanently put it on my account.

655
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:17,000
And I can't change it without some fucking court order or something like that. Like this is still a big problem with Blizzard.

656
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:27,000
And one that I really wish, because Blizzard is pretty decent about listening to their fan base when they make a stink, I wish there was more of a stink about this issue because it sucks.

657
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Especially for those of us that for protection and, you know, things that have happened to us in the past don't always like to use their birth names.

658
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:45,000
So I really wish Blizzard, all they have to do, look, if they want to make you accountable or whatever by having your real name, fine, have it on a mouseover.

659
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Have it on view profile. Like if you're like, Sky, who's Sky? Oh, right click view profile. Oh, it's Rob. Oh, that's who that is.

660
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Fine, do it that way. But don't have it be like the name that just shows up in chat with the message. It sucks.

661
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,000
So I just wish Blizzard people would make more of a stink about that because Blizzard might actually listen.

662
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
But I just feel like people either feel like A, there's nothing that can be done. We've already had this real ID debate a long time ago.

663
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Or B, it's just not a big enough issue for some people, whatever. And for a lot of people it isn't a big deal. They use their real name everywhere.

664
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:23,000
But maybe this call of duty thing and how big that news is, maybe that'll spawn a discussion. I don't know.

665
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:31,000
But I just would, again, all I want, I want the Blizzard ID to just default to the nicknames and show real name on request or something if you want to do it that way.

666
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Fine. I'll compromise. Anyway.

667
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Looking at chat over at live.voggenover.com. Oh, they're still talking about the PS4 spam. Not a lot of feedback to my rant there, but they're talking about the Fortnite spam.

668
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Kaijuda is saying, I got spam messages on PlayStation 4 a few times. I've been meaning to turn off messages.

669
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Well, the story about the brick consoles, even I said it. It's not really bricked. Not really bricked.

670
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Asterisked consoles is a good opportunity to remind yourself about that.

671
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Fifth Dream says, happens to me too. Some random dude I friended early on sends messages to 70 people.

672
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Tigercall on chat says, PSN does this thing that would show your IRL name next to your PSN username.

673
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
So I just put in Tiger as the first name and Claws the last name. I got around that too on PSN.

674
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I think it's because I linked it to my Facebook, which is not my real name, or PlayStation lets you fill it in.

675
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Like, you don't have to fucking call Sony to be like, I need to change my real name. I'm pretty sure.

676
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Maybe somebody in chat can correct me if I'm wrong. You can change it yourself by going in there and just changing your name.

677
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Blizzard does not let you change your name without, like, calling and jumping through hoops.

678
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:46,000
This has gotten them some shit with transgender individuals who, you know, go through a process of changing their name and so forth.

679
00:56:46,000 --> 00:57:00,000
But I believe, to be fair to Blizzard, under some type of heat and feedback, they reduce the requirements to change that sort of information to make that process easier for those folks going through that.

680
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Anyhow. Yeah, BobbyBlackWolf in chat says, I never linked anything to my Battle.net account either, so they actually still believe my name is BobbyBlackWolf.

681
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Yeah, they took my info off my credit card. That's what pisses me off. That's how they got my real name.

682
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:24,000
So I'm just, I'm really... Anyway. Alright. Let's move on and talk a little bit about other ways to lock things down.

683
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
But this time, a little more literally, how do you lock things down?

684
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:39,000
It's a new item called the Switch Safe. It locks the Switch to the dock and prevents the game card slot from being used, and it has a little lock on it.

685
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:47,000
So it's basically a dock for your dock that you can put the Nintendo Switch in and you can lock it away.

686
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Maybe if you're afraid it's gonna get stolen or something like that. I don't know. But what I think it's really for is for families with kids.

687
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:01,000
And you know how you might tell the kids, now you don't get to play Nintendo Switch until all your homework is done, and I better not see what...

688
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:08,000
This is a way that you can make sure you're literally putting it under lock and key so that the kid can't play the Switch until they've done all their homework.

689
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:15,000
So that is a, that's a new little item there that you can get for sale, the actual Switch Safe. Would you get one of these for your house, Loki?

690
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
No.

691
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Keep your kids away?

692
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:26,000
By the way, this is not the first time there's been something like this. Do you remember this for the NES? And Dartetsuya posted this in our story forms.

693
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Yes, I remember that.

694
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:40,000
He's like, it reminds me of this. It looked like this little bar you put on your original Nintendo Entertainment System that would like hold the lid up and prevent games from going in. It was the master lock.

695
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
It's the club.

696
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:49,000
It basically is, it's the club. You guys remember that too for your car, for your car from getting stolen, you put the club on the street. It's basically that but for your Nintendo Entertainment System.

697
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:56,000
So it kind of is a throwback to that in a way. So it's interesting how all these parental controls have evolved over the years.

698
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:05,000
But also, it's interesting because doesn't Nintendo Switch kind of like have parental controls and they're pretty transparent in how to use them?

699
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:12,000
And if you want to see what your kid is playing and when, if you just educate yourself on it a little bit, it's really easy to find that information out.

700
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Totally easy.

701
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
But most people don't know how to do it. So they're like, I'm just going to pick up this lock and key.

702
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Ignorance is cash.

703
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I think that is a good way to sum it up. Ignorance is cash. TigerConChat says, do people still use the club? I think if you drive a car from that era still, which some people do, you might.

704
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Probably not because they're really easy to break through.

705
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Oh, are they? See, now a lot of cars are all about like, I know my car uses a fob. So you don't even have a key anymore.

706
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
You can still spoof those, I think.

707
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I was going to say, there's got, but certainly like, okay, you know how like your garage door opener runs on like a wireless signal?

708
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,000
So you can, you can change the code on your garage door to basically make it run on a different signal.

709
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
So like somebody can't just drive around the neighborhood holding down the garage door button and hope to open your garage, right?

710
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,000
You can change the code to something unique to prevent that. I would imagine like fobs are kind of like that too.

711
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Or, I mean, there's so like, there's got to be a unique key in them that's 120.

712
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Well, yeah. And I think originally garage door openers were infrared and they're a little bit more limited, but I think nowadays probably that probably just wireless.

713
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:24,000
And yeah, it's a little bit more, I don't know, higher tech.

714
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:31,000
SHO 100 Matt in chat over at live.voguenetwork.com says, I still see a ton of people using the club on older cars.

715
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:38,000
So, you know, for the good old cars that still run on ignition keys and things like that, of which there's, I mean, heck, my 2010 Civic ran on a key still.

716
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
So technically I, well, that's Alan's car now. He could use the club.

717
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I have a 2017 car, but mine has the chip in the key though. So.

718
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Oh, you know what? I think my Honda did too. I think that you're right. I think there was still like a chip in the key and it wouldn't work without it.

719
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:59,000
So you're right. All right. Anyway, uh, let's move on a couple more new stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.

720
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Uh, next up a game you and I played a lot of exciting stuff.

721
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:10,000
It's Pokemon Go. And it's only a matter of time because they've already teased it. There's new Pokemon coming.

722
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:18,000
But when, when you might say, I think probably in the next few weeks, maybe right after a Halloween update, maybe. I don't know.

723
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
But gen four is coming and along with that, some rebalancing to the game as well.

724
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:31,000
So they're going to be doing some rebalancing to the battle mechanic, including adjusting CP values, um, to improve balance.

725
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
HP values. Thank God. Fucking Blissey.

726
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:40,000
No, my gym queen. No, she needs a nerf. It's fine.

727
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Um, so they're going to adjust that to close the gap between high HP Pokemon and low HP Pokemon.

728
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Pokemon defense and stamina values will be retroactively rebalanced, allowing higher defense Pokemon to be valuable in battle by outlasting opponents rather than simply running back the clock.

729
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Uh, defensive values have also been slightly retroactively reduced for most Pokemon changes.

730
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Um, or changes like this will help narrow the gap between Pokemon with the highest defensive stats and other Pokemon.

731
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:17,000
And then they're saying the other migration changes, um, adjustments to the weather and moving forward will have a reduced effect on the rate at which Pokemon spawn.

732
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Is that like bad weather? Because that's even worse.

733
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Um, no, I think it's that like, you know, um, how some climates just don't ever get rain like here or snow.

734
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,000
So it's basically those, I mean, I think it sounds like they'll still enhance some of the spawns, but it's not going to be like dependent.

735
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Oh yeah. It's not going to be like where I look at it now and like 30 of the Pokemon in there nearby are enhanced by the weather type thing.

736
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Yeah, it's going to be, it'll still be there, but not to the extent you see it now.

737
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Um, apparently they said as you explore a given area, you'll notice that a greater variety of Pokemon will appear over time in different rates. Cool.

738
01:02:51,000 --> 01:03:00,000
That is very good. Well, cause I'm wondering like with gen four hitting, that's a lot of, like, especially if you're new to the game, you're going to be overwhelmed with all the fucking Pokemon that are out there.

739
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
So, I mean, there's gotta be a way to kind of distribute the Pokemon in different ways.

740
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Certain areas such as parks and nature reserves are now going to contain a more variety, um, variety of Pokemon species.

741
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:17,000
And that's going to be one way to do it. They're going to probably limit some types of spawns to parks. So that'd be interesting.

742
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I'm, I'm down for a variety, especially after this psychic week and whatever, like they had, was it the day of female Pokemon, which I was like, Ooh, I got my love disc cause I didn't have that yet.

743
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Oh, wow. You didn't have a love disc. Yeah, but everything else is like, eh, I don't need that.

744
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Well, they also did shiny, uh, needle, needle queen and evolution.

745
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I didn't get any of those. Yeah, no, I didn't either. I did get a shiny drowsy though. Just randomly from the psychic event going on. So that's kind of cool.

746
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:48,000
It's more and more shinies that are out there now. So yeah. You know, and coming up this Sunday is a Bedlam. Yes. Day. Yes.

747
01:03:48,000 --> 01:04:01,000
So gen four, when, um, I believe if you follow some of the like Reddits and stuff that really get into the nitty gritty of this, Android got a limited release of the version of the game that is basically has the gen four Pokemon in it.

748
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:08,000
It has to be enabled server side still. So, and they do that. So that way, like Android and iPhone are not getting them at separate times.

749
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:15,000
And then at some point they'll force an upgrade. So you're going to have to download the latest version. That's when you know, the gen four Pokemon are here, uh, with the psychic event ending Monday.

750
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Honestly, I think gen four is hitting next week. Um, well at least let me dial that back a little bit. The rebalancing will hit next week. I think, I think that might come first and then gen four, like really soon.

751
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I thought they would do like on a Halloween event or something like that where it's like ghost Pokemon or something. They might, they might just unleash them all.

752
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I mean, because so much of gen four is evolutions and pre evolutions, like with ride on and, and that whole thing with them getting, uh, it was like the mega evolutions now.

753
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:56,000
No, no, they're not mega evolutions. They're just like, they get new forms. So like electabuzz has a new form. Uh, so there's Rhyhorn, Rhydon, and that's why some of the rebalancing has to happen.

754
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Like Rhydon is like one of the most, like I might be switching them around. Sorry. But that rhinoceros dude, he's like one of your best like Raiders and like if he's getting another form, that thing is going to be overpowered as fuck.

755
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:19,000
So they have to dial it back a little bit. So that's what I'm waiting for. My Merkrow to update. I've got so much candy. It's like you're a fucking useless piece of shit, but I'm going to keep you because, uh, mammal swine is going to be new.

756
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:33,000
That's, you know, a big one for the, that, that, uh, line. So yeah, I, so that, that's why I kind of think they can't do just the ghosts first because there's going to be so much gen four that it revolves on evolution and stuff.

757
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:48,000
So we'll see what happens. Uh, looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Uh, let's see. Bobby says, if there's one thing that I've learned from the gaming community, it's that just because something makes a lot of money doesn't mean it isn't failing.

758
01:05:49,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Uh, let's see. Yeah, there's still, there's still a lot of money. Act F points out dead gay cause they're joking about the dead game thing. I know Bobby's not serious because I still send him gifts and Pokemon go and he opens them.

759
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:12,000
So act F says black Wolf, a dead game that made over $84 million only in September. Oh yeah. Well, cause people were buying incubators like mad to get their fucking mime and a Kangaskhan. Guilty.

760
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I got a mime, but I don't remember where I got that from. I got it from some, I think it must've hatched it. One of the eggs, probably one of the Alolan eggs finally gave you one. So there you go. Let me get me now. Nothing.

761
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Uh, Alolan eggs, Alolan eggs are just kind of generic right now, but I would assume when gen four hits, there's going to be something in them you're going to want. I know they're going to do it when gen four hits.

762
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:45,000
They're going to be like, Oh, such and such things are only, I was an idiot. So I had that whole Evie like that for the celiby thing. I've had the Evie thing where you have to walk an Evie for 10 kilometers and then evolve it. Oh right.

763
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I walked it for 10 kilometers, switched it with something else and forgot to evolve it. Like, no, damn you. You have to, it has a big common mistake people make. You have to evolve it while it's your buddy.

764
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Do not drop it out of your inventory. You can put it back as your buddy and I think you're okay because I think it still has the walk, but you have to evolve it when it is your buddy.

765
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Hmm. So if you're willing to sacrifice it or look it up on the internet first, I'm sure somebody has done it. Maybe somebody in our channels. Well, I did evolve it already and I think actually it's, it's yeah, it evolves into something else.

766
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:28,000
But, uh, let's see. Go into chat at live.vognetwork.com. Tigerclaw wants some Pokeballs. Sorry, Tigerclaw. I'm trying to send gifts, but, um, especially on like Sundays, I don't get out on Sundays.

767
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:39,000
So like no gifts go out at all on Sundays, but other days it just depends on what I'm doing. Like when I was in Reno, like I got so many fucking Poke stops while we were in Reno.

768
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I think I sent a gift to every single person on my friends list. It's like 120 people. I sent a gift to every single person that didn't already have something sitting in their inventory.

769
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Because I think you're, you're limited to sending a hundred gifts a day. There, I just sent you one. Oh, you sent Tigerclaw one? Yes, I sent him. Oh, what a nice guy. Nice guy, Loki. There you go.

770
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:10,000
So it just depends. But if I try to catch, like I sometimes like I don't get enough gifts out of the Poke stops and because I know I usually with my walks, I try to walk past as many of them as I can.

771
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:23,000
But you know, you sometimes you go with like a few spins that it's not that or what'll happen is like, yeah, I'll have my gotcha on and I forget. Oh yeah, I can only collect 10 gifts at a time and I forget to send them.

772
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Yeah. Which happened yesterday. Yeah. And my big thing is I forget to open them. Like, I'll be like, Oh, before I go to bed, I'm going to open all my gifts to make sure I hit the max today.

773
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:43,000
And I usually go through and I'll open gifts first from people who I haven't had an interaction with yet for the day to get, you know, as much credit as I can with the leveling up of all the different friendships that I have.

774
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:52,000
But, um, yeah, then I'll forget. And then it would be like, oops, it's one 30 in the morning and it's now tomorrow. So whoops. Uh, I've done that so many times anyway.

775
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Yeah. Which by the way, five more days. Yeah. We're going to hit BFF next week. Same thing with Jamie. So I hit, I hit BFF like four people next week, which will be nice because if I time it with the lucky eggs, which you better tell me when we hit it. Cause I can do a lucky egg.

776
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:16,000
If I, yeah, I just didn't like act after that too. He told me that we're going to hit it, but then like, I didn't have a lucky egg on me.

777
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I've got like, I was like, I was like, okay, I'm gonna go buy one in his poop popped and like, Oh yeah, you have to do it right away. Like as soon as the game opens, go bring up your screen to do the inventory so it can't beat you to the pop up or whatever.

778
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:41,000
But yeah, if you can pop a lucky egg, uh, I will hit level 40 next week with those friendship increases. Um, if I'm able to lucky egg them all and I'm very excited because that means I'm going to be in the rare level 16 level 40 club.

779
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:51,000
There's a few, I'm actually in a chat for level 16 years. Players who haven't also played on go and there's a few, but not a lot. So it'll be pretty soon whenever Harry Potter, Harry Potter.

780
01:09:52,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I got my eye on that whenever that starts. So we'll see. All right. Anyhow, uh, gen four, but we want to go coming soon. Also coming soon, but not that soon coming less soon in the way future.

781
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:14,000
The PlayStation four successor, which I mean, is it not going to be called the PlayStation five? Would you not call it the plate? I don't know. I guess somebody can do whatever the fuck they want.

782
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:29,000
And then again, you know, Microsoft, yeah. Xbox one, three 16 in an interview with the financial times. Uh, Kenny Shiro Yoshida, who's now the boss of Sony did say at this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next generation hardware.

783
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Uh, and the financial times continued the early indications, uh, were that it might not be a major departure from the PS four and that the fundamental architecture will be similar.

784
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:49,000
So basically they're saying, yep, we're working on the PlayStation successor, which we already knew they were working on the PlayStation successor the day, the PS four hit shelves.

785
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:57,000
That's how long these things take. Especially, you know, if we're going to be talking full four K gaming on that, which is I imagine is what it's going to be on the next round of consoles.

786
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Like you're going to have, you know, companies that are already working on it because it's going to take that time to develop those type of games.

787
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:13,000
So, um, yeah, I'm sure it's just a matter of when is it next year is going to be 2020. Who know? I would say probably at this point 2020.

788
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I hope so. Yeah. Although Microsoft really kind of set the stage to unveil something next year.

789
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Although I feel like that's shooting the Xbox one X in the foot a little bit, but we also know that Microsoft's plan is that whatever is their next console, you could still play the games for that console on the old systems.

790
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:42,000
But it's like the cell phones and we, we, I think we had to play their old games on our, their old console games on my system, my PC.

791
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Oh, even with that, that too, as a lot of other games are out there, new console on my PC.

792
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,000
But you know what I mean? Like if they come out with, you know, halo 21 or whatever they're up to now. Oh no, it's halo infinite.

793
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
So if halo infinite comes out on the next console, it's still going to play on the old consoles as well.

794
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:07,000
But it's kind of like your cell phone is that, you know, Pokemon go doesn't run quite the same on an iPhone six as it does on an iPhone 10.

795
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:17,000
There's a little bit of a difference, right? Right. So that's kind of what you can expect with something like what will happen in Microsoft's future and perhaps PlayStations as well.

796
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I would assume, although I could be very fucking incorrect in this, but I hope Sony doesn't fuck this up, that the PlayStation five will be built so that you can play a PlayStation four games on it.

797
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I hope, I don't know you guys. Anyway, that is it for what is going on with the current and the new games, but I think we should take a moment to journey to gaming's past.

798
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I will say though tonight, the segment for gaming's past is a little shorter than it has been previously because we had to catch Dark Sakura during a break during the day to day.

799
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:00,000
So for those of you that step away during the break and so forth, you won't have as much time tonight.

800
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,000
So anyway, with that being said, let's get in the time portal and visit the classic game of the week.

801
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:14,000
And so we take a step back through time and space and radio magic and Skype to welcome Dark Sakura to the show.

802
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Hi Jamie, how are you doing?

803
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I'm okay. How are you?

804
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I'm doing well. I'd be better if you were here, but I understand, you know, circumstances are what they are.

805
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Yep.

806
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
So you're actually calling us like while you're on break at your job right now, right?

807
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Well, I'm on lunch. Yeah.

808
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Yeah. That's dedication. So Dark Sakura is dedicated to bringing you the classic game every week here on the show.

809
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:46,000
So let's get to it Dark Sakura. What did you pick as folks should be going into their own gaming vaults and finding a game to play this week?

810
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
What did you pick for the classic game of the week?

811
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,000
We're time traveling to 1999 and picking Jumbo Safari.

812
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I love this game.

813
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
So Jumbo Safari was released by Sega in 1999 and it was a NAOMI game.

814
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Although this was one of the few NAOMI games that did not make it to the Dreamcast, which, you know, was the course of the system at the time.

815
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:19,000
It also was supposed to be one of the real life career series games along with Brave Firefighters and Emergency Call and Helix.

816
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:30,000
So the other thing with this one is that it did eventually get home versions on the Wii and the DS under the title Jumbo Safari Animal Rescue in 2009.

817
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:42,000
So in this particular game you use a steering wheel and a gear shift on the machine to drive in a jeep and then you shoot a lasso to select your animals or to catch animals.

818
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:50,000
It has one of four different players with their own vehicles. The Wii actually has the same arcade game but it uses the motion control.

819
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Also with that too is that you've got some other little characters and vehicles and stuff like that in the story mode.

820
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Where you go and roam around in the game and you can catch your animals that way and you gain experience points and become a full park ranger.

821
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
It's a little bit more RPG-ish.

822
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:13,000
And you can also interact with the animals in that game and treat their injuries and feed them.

823
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:20,000
And you have co-op mission mode and four player party games like foster tracing.

824
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
The DS version is kind of the same way.

825
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:32,000
So it really was just a very simple game though in the arcade. Catch animals, get points. Catch animals, get points.

826
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,000
And you get hyenas and cheetahs and all kinds of animals.

827
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
But that's really it. It's very simple.

828
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:46,000
The console versions are pretty fun but for me it's just whatever I found in the arcade.

829
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I'm going to go lasso me a hyena.

830
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
And that's it. Jambo Safari.

831
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Yeah, I remember seeing this game in arcades and it's like, either you've seen Jambo Safari in the arcades or you haven't.

832
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
It's a very unique kind of looking game in the arcades.

833
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
And definitely like, you know, oh I'm going to go, you know, rassle me a bear.

834
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Although it's not really. It's more like Safari animals.

835
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
So yeah, like, you know, lions and tigers and ligers.

836
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I'm going to catch a hippo.

837
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Exactly, exactly. But it kind of reminds me of like Crazy Taxi but a safari.

838
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Yeah.

839
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I think that's a good way to put it.

840
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Yeah, it really is along the same vein.

841
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Yeah.

842
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:28,000
And I mean it's like, you see that rhino over there? I'm going to catch him.

843
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Exactly.

844
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I could have done a Pokemon game like that. Like Pokemon Snap Arcade.

845
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I wish, I never did pick this up on the Wii and I kind of wish I had.

846
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:45,000
But yeah, I guess, I guess, you know, maybe it's one of those things that will come back someday either on the Switch or something like that.

847
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
You should tweet Sega immediately and demand Jambo Safari.

848
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
There's other games I'd rather see.

849
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:00,000
But it is fun. I mean, if they did that, it should be like called Let Safari!

850
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Plus it's unique. I think that's one other thing that makes this like classic game of the week very suitable is that, you know, you can't think of a lot of games that are about like safari animals.

851
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Well, maybe the PlayStation 3 classic Africa.

852
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Africa.

853
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Africa.

854
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Yeah.

855
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:21,000
But this isn't that. This is, you know, a little more action packed and a little more arcade fun type of thing.

856
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Exactly.

857
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Exactly.

858
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
All right. Well, there it is. Short and sweet. But yeah, I know you're on break tonight.

859
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,000
So do you have any final thoughts for our listeners before we head back to the show?

860
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
I wish I was on the show right now.

861
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Oh, we miss you. Come back.

862
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
What are you throwing?

863
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
What's that?

864
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
What are you throwing if you're missing?

865
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,000
I'm going to drive my Jambo Safari to the Jeep over there and I'm going to lasso you in.

866
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Ah, no. It's just painful.

867
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Yeah. Well, I would rather be doing the show, but I got to earn that money.

868
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
That's right. Make that money. All right. We'll see you next week.

869
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
All right. Bye.

870
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with our 748th episode already in progress for this October the 14th of 2018.

871
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Let's get back into some rapid fire news.

872
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
We will be opening up the Skype line a little later in our show at Orange Lounge Radio.

873
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
All one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.

874
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Is Mr. Smoosh's, like, screaming coming through the mics?

875
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
He's very antsy. I'll go give him some kibble to try to shut him up.

876
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
So you might have to take the rapid fire news a little longer tonight, Loki.

877
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:43,000
All righty. Sounds good. Anyways, so hey, who likes Commodore 64 games?

878
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Me!

879
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Anyways, as part of the Internet Archive, they've recently added a Commodore 64 emulator, as of last month, actually.

880
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,000
And you can actually check out quite a few Commodore 64 games that are on there as well.

881
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:07,000
So in total, they've uploaded, I guess, 15,000 programs, including 9,000 games.

882
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:15,000
The Commodore 64 catalog has quite a bunch of classic games, including Donkey Kong, Ms. Pac-Man, Space Invaders, and whatnot.

883
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
And they have, like, curated, I guess, like a showcase.

884
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:33,000
So if you want to check out the Commodore 64 and the different games you can play, you can actually go to archive.org slash details slash softwarelibrary underscore c64 underscore showcase.

885
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:41,000
And you can check out, they have Bubble Bobble, Donkey Kong, Ghostbusters, Ms. Pac-Man, Blood Money, Defender, and Chucky Egg.

886
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Huh. That's amazing. I was just reminiscing about Commodore 64 with a friend this week, so it actually kind of made me want to go play some more Commodore 64 games and maybe do some streaming or even maybe videos on demand.

887
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Kind of like the, remember that project Let's Remember I did on YouTube for like a month? Maybe bring that back with some old Commodore 64 games because such good memories.

888
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
All that stuff, all those games are great.

889
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

890
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:14,000
So, yeah, check it out if you're interested. And actually, I think there might be more than that available to actually check out.

891
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I just loaded up, yeah, here we go. Yeah, Ghosts and Goblins.

892
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Yeah, pretty much I think the whole library is available, so if you actually go to archive.org slash details slash softwarelibrary underscore c64 underscore games, you can check out the full library, which is, they have 9,000 results almost, including like BurgerTime, Choplifter, The Last Ninja.

893
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
And you can browse through there and find everything that's playable.

894
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Oh, B.C. Quest for Wheels. I thought it was B.C.'s Quest for Wheels. I remember playing that on the ColecoVision.

895
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Yeah, I remember that game too. B.C. was a comic strip, if you didn't know. It's about cavemen and stuff. They had a computer game about it, yeah.

896
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Yeah, I used to love that game.

897
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Yeah, it's an awesome game.

898
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Alright, and then other fun stuff. This kind of falls along the lines of one of my other interests, which is LEGO.

899
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:18,000
And Overwatch now has some new official LEGO sets that you can check out. The first one, of course, being the Omnic Bastion set.

900
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:30,000
For $25, you can purchase it via the Blizzard store, and also be on sale at BlizzCon. I may have to purchase this, because I like LEGOs.

901
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:37,000
You do like LEGOs, and Overwatch is pretty sweet. I know you're not a big Overwatch player, but the characters, the lore, all that stuff is really cool.

902
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
But they have minifigs coming too, so it's not just Bastion.

903
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Yeah, yeah. I mean...

904
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
I'll have to get D.Va when that happens.

905
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Yeah, I was going to say, Alan's super into Overwatch, but I think Trastian is one of his not-so-picked players.

906
01:21:52,000 --> 01:22:01,000
So, I don't know if he'll want to get this, but if they come out with Symmetra, Lucio, Zarya, like one of the characters I know he really loves.

907
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:08,000
He's a really good Zarya, by the way. So, he kind of got me to play the more. I need to play more Overwatch.

908
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:14,000
They're doing that Halloween event right now, too, and everything, and they just reworked Torbjorn, and I played...

909
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:22,000
That was something I did do. I didn't talk about it, really, but I just went into the Torbjorn training mode, just to see how he played now.

910
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Because I actually really liked Torbjorn before, so I was a little scared of the changes, but it's interesting.

911
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:35,000
They made it so you can kind of let you throw the turret, and it self-builds now, and then you shoot lava. It's different. I don't know how I feel yet.

912
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
I'll have to get in there and actually play it in some matches.

913
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Do you play as the Hamster?

914
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I have a Wrecking Ball. I've played as Wrecking Ball, but I can't really figure out how to play Wrecking Ball effectively.

915
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:57,000
But you know, Xtaphir, my old buddy from Hoard House, got a play of the game this week as Wrecking Ball, so I think he's kind of playing that character.

916
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:06,000
I love Wrecking Ball as a character. Well, I love Tracer as a character, but I can't fucking play her for shit in the game. I can't figure it out.

917
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I'm more excited when these characters come over to Heroes of the Storm, because not all of them are in Heroes of the Storm, but somebody like Lucio in Heroes of the Storm plays just like he does in Overwatch, but it's just a different type of game.

918
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
So it's kind of a neat thing. I don't know. Anyway.

919
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:28,000
All right, moving on with some more rapid-fire news, although, you know what, it's kind of a short show so far, so it's probably going to be a shorter show tonight, so we can spend a little more time on rapid news.

920
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Stardew Valley, which I know some of you are addicted to. You can get addicted all over again on mobile.

921
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:42,000
That's right. The publisher of the game, Chucklefish, said that for iOS it will be released on October 24th, and I'm assuming Android is coming soon after.

922
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:48,000
So for those of you that want to play Stardew Valley on the road, or anyone that somehow hasn't played it yet, you will soon have your opportunity.

923
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Also, something you'll have the opportunity for is that Sony finally, officially, officially saying that you will be able to change your PlayStation ID.

924
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:03,000
That's right. It was announced this week starting in early 2019. You can change your old PlayStation Network ID.

925
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Part of the news I wouldn't have expected is that the first change will be free. So everybody gets one new free name change, which is cool, I guess.

926
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:20,000
If you want to change it after that, $10 a pop, or only $5 if you're with PlayStation Plus. Beta testing is going to begin soon if you're part of the preview program.

927
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:27,000
However, this is interesting. Not all games will support the new ID.

928
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:39,000
So this must have really been some poor planning that Sony is paying for now, because apparently any PS4 game published after April 1st, 2018 will support it.

929
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:49,000
The rest? Not guaranteed. However, Sony does say a large majority of the most played PS4 games that were released before.

930
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Which I would imagine would mean probably anything first party, but they're not going to be able to account for a lot of the third party stuff, especially if they didn't help them with it.

931
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:05,000
And I would imagine like maybe indie stuff may really have a problem as well. So just a heads up. That's so weird to me.

932
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
But it's just the way it worked behind the scenes. That's just how it happened.

933
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:18,000
They do also say, not all games applications for PS4, PS3, and Vita systems are guaranteed to support the online ID change.

934
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Users may occasionally encounter issues or errors in certain games.

935
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:31,000
If you experience issues after changing your ID, you can revert back to the original for free at any time.

936
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Reverting back to the old ID will resolve most issues caused by the name change.

937
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
So, in other words, don't change.

938
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Never change. Change is bad.

939
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
If you play old stuff, don't change.

940
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:57,000
The thing about this though, I don't know. I kind of feel like people are making a bigger deal out of this than is necessary.

941
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:04,000
But, you know, it would be unfair of me to sit here and complain about real ID and not kind of point out the whole, this is a little silly too.

942
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Because people do change their identities and so forth later on.

943
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:14,000
You know, people want to go, maybe the name they picked when they were 13 years old playing Fortnite isn't quite what they want when they're 21 years old.

944
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
You know, which PlayStation 3 and 4 and online has been around that long.

945
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Where, you know, some folks that were 12 and 13 when this first rolled out are like in their 20s now and they want to change their damn name.

946
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:34,000
So I get it to that extent, but because of the way Sony's infrastructure was set up, you're not really changing your name, it sounds like, because the old name is like there forever.

947
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
It's just like there's some type of, we're just calling it something different for now.

948
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Pretty much, pretty much. So yeah.

949
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:49,000
And Brad from Pod Culture points out Sky versus Rob Roberts on Twitter, you know, and that's in our chat room.

950
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,000
It's a fair call out, but I'm not going to change my PlayStation ID to Rob Roberts.

951
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Like, I don't see the need. I'm fine with still being like Sky on consoles.

952
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Well, here's the other thing, you know, here's the other reason I don't change because PlayStation 4 has all that Facebook integration now.

953
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:15,000
So like, even if many of you change your names, I'm never going to see it because I have your Facebook name in my friends list.

954
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:21,000
And that's actually kind of what I prefer. Isn't that funny? Because now I'm going back and saying, I like the real name thing.

955
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:29,000
But it's your Facebook name, you can change it whenever you want, you don't have to like call, you know, it's a lot easier to do.

956
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:35,000
It's also like, you have a choice, whereas, you know, it's kind of forced upon you otherwise.

957
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Yeah. So I'm probably just not going to be changing my online username.

958
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,000
So, alright, let's travel around the world and check out what's coming out in stores this week.

959
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Games that will support these changes because they're after April 1st.

960
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Yes. So Big Buck Hunter Arcade for Nintendo Switch.

961
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Crayola Scoot on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Apparently that's an extreme sports game, whatever the fuck that's supposed to be.

962
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Lego DC Super Villains on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

963
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:14,000
NBA 2K Playgrounds 2 on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

964
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Rapala Fishing Pro Series on the Switch.

965
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Starlink, or Star Fox, but still Starlink, Battle for Atlas on the Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

966
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Warriors Orochi 4 on PlayStation 4, the Switch, PC, and Xbox One.

967
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Let's try to pronounce this one. I think it's DICE, RA, Amantas, Armentis.

968
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
It's a visual novel game. It's on the Switch.

969
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Moto Racer 4 on the Switch, Siberia 3 on the Switch, and let's see, Sinner, Sakura Fice for Redemption.

970
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
That's a weird way to spell that.

971
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,000
That's on the Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

972
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Dark Souls Remastered on the Switch, and last but not least, Soul Calibur 4 on...

973
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
6.

974
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:19,000
6, whatever. 4, 6. It's all the same. It's not going to have Yoda in this one?

975
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
No, it's not. It's going to have the Witcher guy, Geralt.

976
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Close enough. That's like Yoda, right?

977
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Close enough.

978
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Soul Calibur 6 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

979
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,000
By the way, Siya Tabiri would like you to know it's pronounced Diaz-E-Ray.

980
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
There you go.

981
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Traveling to Japan. Probably the big release over there on the PlayStation 4 this week is Soul Calibur 6 on October 18th.

982
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I know I am really looking forward to that. That's a fighting series that I enjoy.

983
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,000
So to celebrate Soul Calibur 6, you can also get a special arcade stick that's going to be coming out as well.

984
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:56,000
And I believe they may... No, they do not have a special PlayStation. There's just other types of...

985
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
There's like third-party joysticks you can get, too.

986
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,000
I'm surprised there's not a special PlayStation 4 to celebrate it, but it looks like they don't have that.

987
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
If Soul Calibur isn't up your alley, then you can look forward to Crystar.

988
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,000
It's another big game that's coming out in Japan this week. Both those games on the 18th.

989
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
That's really it for the PlayStation 4. I imagine Soul Calibur is kind of a big deal.

990
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:20,000
But over on the Nintendo Switch, you have Dark Souls Remastered getting its Japanese release this week.

991
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:26,000
There is that Dark Souls figure that comes with that. So your amiibo, for those of you still collecting amiibo.

992
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Also, Crash Bandicoot Butobi San Dan Mori, which is of course the Crash Bandicoot collection.

993
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,000
That is coming out on the Switch over there as well. So that's what you have to look forward to.

994
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:42,000
DS Irae is also on the Nintendo Switch. That whole game is hitting Japan this week as well.

995
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Without Dark Sakura, we have no one to do the UK dates. Maybe you could pick that up, Loki?

996
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Or maybe Mr. Smoosh wants to scream it into the mic.

997
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Yeah, he's very interested in doing that.

998
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
God, he's having a fit. Because his other dad's not here.

999
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Well, in the UK you're getting Big Buck Hunter Arcade on the Switch.

1000
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Starlink Battle for Atlas on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch.

1001
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Dark Souls Remastered on the Switch. Warriors Orochi 4 on the Switch.

1002
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1003
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Siberia 3 on the Switch. Project High Rise Architects Edition on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch.

1004
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:25,000
And, let's see, Soul Calibur 6 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1005
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:32,000
And we have Crayola Scoot on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch.

1006
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Luigi's Mansion on 3DS.

1007
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:40,000
And Lego DC Super Villains, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch.

1008
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Motor Racer 4 on the Switch.

1009
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
And finally, Grave Danger on PlayStation 4 and the Switch.

1010
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Lots of Switch games.

1011
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,000
So, the chat over at live.vognetwork.com is lighting up going,

1012
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Poor Mr. Smoosh, give him attention. Nobody loves him except for all his internet fans. Give him a mic.

1013
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Okay, first off, we love Mr. Smoosh. You know that. Shut up.

1014
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I could call him over here. He's not a dog. He's not gonna come over here. Cats do whatever the hell they want.

1015
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
So, I wouldn't be able to get him over here on a mic even if I could. Oh, oh. Other dad just got home,

1016
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
and so now Mr. Smoosh will be following him around like crazy. I just sent Alan a message going,

1017
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
He's being a terror.

1018
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Okay, you guys. Alan's here, and he'll take care of Mr. Smoosh.

1019
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:31,000
But sadly, no mic, because you can't make cats do anything, and you all know that.

1020
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,000
You cat lovers know that. Cats do what they want.

1021
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,000
You don't own the cat. The cat owns you.

1022
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Let's get to the email, because you guys own us with your thoughts and opinions.

1023
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Every week with your emails, if you want to send us emails,

1024
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,000
participate at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send your emails,

1025
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
and we read your emails here live on air.

1026
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
We have two emails tonight, and the first one to us comes from YYR,

1027
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:03,000
who's continuing on his DDR adventures and questions for you, Loki, from a previous episode.

1028
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
So let's start. YYR starts us off tonight.

1029
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Hello, LR. Thanks as always for the show, for promoting my crude-looking games.

1030
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:16,000
They're retro, YYR, and for reading and responding to these emails of mine.

1031
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:21,000
In response to the in-depth discussion that was had last week regarding Loki's DDR progress,

1032
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
or lack thereof, I'll make a few suggestions.

1033
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Loki, you can follow them or not based on how much you're looking to build your skills, if at all.

1034
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
And you can find out by following Loki on Twitch at lokiolr.

1035
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,000
We'll see what my skills are and how I stumble about, but I don't use the bar.

1036
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Maybe you'll have to start. Who knows?

1037
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
YYR might be your first Twitch subscriber when you hit that affiliate status. Anyway.

1038
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
YYR continues, in my typical two sessions per week,

1039
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,000
I personally find it difficult to focus both on single and double skill building within the same session.

1040
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
If I'm seriously looking to improve, I have to focus on one or the other.

1041
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I do try to switch between them regularly, though,

1042
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:05,000
because I definitely find that skill building in one style does help the other, for me at least.

1043
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,000
For example, I learned how to do crossovers properly in single by playing double.

1044
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,000
It sounds to me like you do ultimately want to focus on double, which is fantastic,

1045
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,000
but that you've hit a wall. My recommendation is that you focus a bit more on single at the moment

1046
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:25,000
in an effort to practice foot speed and streams, with the goal being to break into the upper 8, lower 9 range,

1047
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,000
because doubles charts have similar density and patterns to their single counterparts

1048
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,000
that should help prepare you to break through the wall and eventually reach the same point on double.

1049
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Which, you know, if you aren't playing doubles, Loki, you're not going to use the bar anyway.

1050
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Well, I take that back.

1051
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Yeah, you say that, but I've seen that.

1052
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
If your legs are big enough, you can do it.

1053
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
My legs are not big enough. That's not an option.

1054
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Yeah. Some specific charts. YYR getting into the theory of all games. This is game theory.

1055
01:34:53,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Anyway, some specific charts to work on or work towards could include the heavy difficulties of B-Lovin', Dxy, Zenon, La Senorita Virtual, and Do You Remember Me?

1056
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,000
So, for those that are not as well-versed in DDR, those are all songs in the game.

1057
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Also, I would encourage you to try the standard difficulties of the boss stages.

1058
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,000
In other words, anything with Survivor or Max in the title except for Trip Machine Survivor.

1059
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:23,000
These are much easier than the heavy versions, but retain the high speed so they make for great practice.

1060
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,000
If any of this sounds unattainable, well, that's good because it will make it much more satisfying when you do nail it.

1061
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Just remember, everyone thought Max 300 looked impossible the first time they saw it, myself included.

1062
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:43,000
But now, even as I'm turning 39 next month, one of my goals is to get a perfect, full combo on that very same Max 300 Expert Chart on DDR Ace.

1063
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I think the best way to improve at DDR is to set goals that seem like they're just a little bit out of reach, then work towards them as best you can.

1064
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Good luck! I'll end by expressing my disappointment at something that I believe was missing from last week's episode.

1065
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:05,000
It is true that there were a few mentions, but I was looking for a full segment containing news and updates covering everything new in the world of Bowsette.

1066
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,000
On the Orange Launch Radio website, the subtitle proclaims, news that gamers really want to know.

1067
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Well, I'm Gamer, and I want to know about the latest Bowsette innovations, cosplays, and especially dank memes.

1068
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
So please implement this new segment starting next week.

1069
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Well, YYR, when it comes to Bowsette, all I have to say is that's fake news, and we don't talk about fake news that gamers really want to know about.

1070
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Thank you as always for listening to our feedback and implementing it into the show.

1071
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Have a great week, lots of love, YYR.

1072
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:46,000
P.S. Yes, the ridiculous request for a Bowsette segment was made specifically so we could all hear Rob's reaction. You're welcome.

1073
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Fake news, fake reaction. Alright, moving on.

1074
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:59,000
It's not that I hate Bowsette. Let's talk about this for a minute. Can we talk? Can we twawk? We're gonna twawk.

1075
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
It's not that I hate Bowsette. I hate what you've all done with it.

1076
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,000
There's a difference. There's a big difference.

1077
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Did you see, did you see the trailer for the Bowsette porn that hit the web this week, or maybe it was last week?

1078
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Which one?

1079
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Exactly. Exactly. Delete it.

1080
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Moving on. One more email tonight from Frodo Swagons, who sends us like a, it's like a Twitter sized email basically.

1081
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:41,000
So Frodo Swagons sends us an email that says, Loki, you were just elected the president of Nintendo. What are your plans for Nintendo's future?

1082
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Frodo Swagons. That's it. That's the email. So I love it. Short and to the point. Frodo Swagons doesn't have time to fuck around here.

1083
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:57,000
It also, actually P.S. sent from Yahoo Mail on Android. So they were on a mobile device when they did it.

1084
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
No Yahoo Mail wasn't on Android yet.

1085
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Oh, now you know. The more you know. Anyway, so one more time. You were just elected the president of Nintendo because that's how presidents get put in place.

1086
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Elected by the board.

1087
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
It really should be. I mean.

1088
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
What are your plans for Nintendo's future? Congratulations on your promotion, Loki.

1089
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
That's awesome.

1090
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
What are you doing day one? What are we doing?

1091
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Day one? Well, first off, we're totally, totally announcing a new F-Zero game.

1092
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Good. Good.

1093
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,000
And then number two, of course, we're announcing Waluigi for Smash.

1094
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Okay. I like where this is going. How about a cease and desist on Bowsette on the internet?

1095
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Oh, she's going in Smash.

1096
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Fuck off.

1097
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Why not?

1098
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Fine. Waluigi and Bowsette in Smash. Fine.

1099
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:49,000
But no, if we really want to piss off the fans, you know, in Nintendo's side, what we'll do is we'll do our own version of Bowsette that's totally like just, you know, more Bowser than Bowsette.

1100
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,000
You know, less Boobs, more dinosaur turtle thing.

1101
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Yeah.

1102
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
So we can do that.

1103
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
What else?

1104
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Mother 3. Got to localize that, of course.

1105
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Yeah, basically what everybody else wants.

1106
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Yeah.

1107
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:17,000
It's kind of less than I would have thought. I thought you would have had this whole spiel and 10-point plan about what to do about online.

1108
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:22,000
My lack of a plan for online is still better than their plan for online.

1109
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Hold yourself for this. Here we go. Because I got this question in chat at live.fognotor.com.

1110
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:34,000
ActDeft in chat says, Rob Roberts, you get the Peachette crown and are elected new president of Nintendo. What do you do?

1111
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Alright, I'm going to do two things. Number one, I'm going to ban Bowsette from the internet.

1112
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Cease and desist all the websites.

1113
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
But you have the Peachette crown.

1114
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:51,000
That's my first step. Second step, I sell the company to Microsoft. Now online will finally be figured out.

1115
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Done. Mic drop. And that's it. I sell the company to Microsoft and give everybody what they've always wanted.

1116
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:08,000
The super company that has, why didn't I sell it to Sony? Because a little more interesting competition. A little more interesting competition if I sell it to Microsoft.

1117
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Microsoft's having problems breaking into Japan. Microsoft can help out with the online. There's a little more of a help me help you situation there.

1118
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
There it is.

1119
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,000
President cat localized.

1120
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Yes. Yes. And then president cat localized on my way out the door.

1121
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
And new F0 again. I guess I have more than two things I want to do. Alright.

1122
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Anyway, thank you for the emails. Participate at OrangeLawnTradio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week. Those are fun.

1123
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Let's get into some more news stories. Low keys.

1124
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Alright. So this is pretty awesome. So they've got this whole, basically you can get a different version of

1125
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
The Legend of Zelda. Well, I wouldn't say it's a different version, but it's a

1126
01:40:53,000 --> 01:41:01,000
A tweet starting save for The Legend of Zelda. They call it The Legend of Zelda Life of Luxury.

1127
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Living the life of luxury. It's apparently a version of Zelda that you can get through the whole NES library on the Switch online app.

1128
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Which allows you to start off the original Legend of Zelda, which originally you start with nothing.

1129
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:19,000
And you have to, you know, get a sword from a man and continue the game through that.

1130
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:30,000
But you start off with a lot more stuff. So you start off with the white sword, a magical shield, blue ring, power bracelet, blue candle, and a red potion and a piece of meat.

1131
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Three extra heart containers as well as a ton of rupees, bombs, and keys.

1132
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:41,000
It's like basically Bobby Black Wolf mode of The Legend of Zelda.

1133
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:47,000
And you get to play the game that way. And then of course if you beat the game then you can get the second quest type thing.

1134
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Neat idea. I wonder if I can get my kids to play Zelda this way, but I don't know.

1135
01:41:54,000 --> 01:42:02,000
I mean, you know, I checked out the Switch online this week and it was cool to see the Solomon's Key and this dodgeball and whatever golf game they added that I don't plan on playing.

1136
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,000
But, you know, the other two games are cool to see. And then, you know, it was kind of like this extra little bonus.

1137
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Like Zelda SP, obviously Twitter ruined it for me so I knew it was coming, but I thought that's kind of interesting.

1138
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:18,000
What do you think? I mean, and basically all it is, it's like either a ROM save state or like a game genie-fied version.

1139
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Because what's interesting about it is that when you start it you completely bypass the title screen. Have you actually gone in to check it out?

1140
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
It sounds like a save state.

1141
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Like a modified save state.

1142
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:35,000
That's what it feels like. It feels like a modified save state. I mean, and I don't know how they did it, but seeing as Nintendo...

1143
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,000
So what happens when you go to those dungeons with those things in there? Is that, it's just like...

1144
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,000
I don't know. I haven't played that far into it yet, so I don't know if they're not there or what.

1145
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:51,000
I'm thinking that's going to be my after show stream tonight as I'm going to play through that and kind of answer some of those questions about where do those items go?

1146
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,000
What happens when you go to those places? So we'll take a look at that later tonight.

1147
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:01,000
It doesn't give you everything because you don't get the magic sword and I think the bow is in one of those levels.

1148
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:10,000
So I think it gives you everything you can buy from merchants, but I'm not sure it gives you the stuff in the levels. You might still have to play through the levels and all that stuff.

1149
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:16,000
But it's still interesting that Nintendo is kind of padding the online library with this stuff.

1150
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:27,000
I mean, okay, it's kind of a, I don't know, it's a bit of a throwaway, but it's not, it is something, Loki, where it's not just a straight up emulation of an old game, you know what I mean?

1151
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Like it's something like, oh, Nintendo did something different.

1152
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Let's give us some ROM hacks. We need some ROM hacks of like, you know, Mario games or Metroid or something. Is Metroid in there already?

1153
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:48,000
I believe it's, it's on the, I think it's next month's big game is next month. Yeah. But who knows, you know, maybe Nintendo is planning to do this to pad the library.

1154
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
I would go for an easy mode in Metroid. I'm down with that.

1155
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Yeah. Well, that's, that's why we had good old passcodes back in the day. Like Justin Bailey understood.

1156
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Yeah, that should still work.

1157
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Yeah. All those old passwords should still work. So, uh, if, if you have an old ass password from the NES days, they should still work.

1158
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:13,000
I mean, the game's programming has not changed or any of that. So you could use a lot, but there's no reason. I mean, what, and again, it wouldn't take much effort on Nintendo's part.

1159
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Why not just like, if you start Metroid, have it go use save password for regular Metroid or for special Metroid, uh, that you play as Samus, like basically Justin Bailey or whatever, or you play as, um, you know what I mean?

1160
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Samus without the suit or that you start with like all the items and stuff like a super code that you can go right to mother brain or whatever. I mean, maybe that's a direction Nintendo's exploring that we see going on here with this, uh, Zelda hack.

1161
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
I wish we get more NES remix stuff.

1162
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:50,000
You know, what's funny is over in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, they're kind of talking about NES remix. Uh, let's see. What was the, oh yes.

1163
01:44:51,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Act Dev says, you know, with this, when are we getting NES remix for NES online? You never know. That could be something. Uh, Tigerclaw follows that up with the real question is when are we getting SNES remix? Never say never.

1164
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:15,000
So, yeah, but I thought this was an interesting direction for Nintendo with the, you know, it's something different besides just the game and it's not much, but it's like, oh, that's a, that's an interesting thing that they did.

1165
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
So I'll be curious to see if they do this with other games in the coming, in the coming weeks.

1166
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Now, um, so I joked earlier about how I would sell Nintendo to Microsoft. I wasn't being serious, you guys, just, just so we're clear.

1167
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Um, but, uh, Microsoft is certainly going to, uh, buy as many studios as they can to really get those first parties and give them an edge, uh, in the next generation of games.

1168
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:49,000
And it sounds like this next one could be a doozy. Uh, Microsoft is finalizing a deal to acquire Obsidian Entertainment, uh, which, you know, Obsidian Entertainment made Pillars of Eternity II and they made some pretty big games.

1169
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Uh, apparently there's been some people briefed on negotiations and it leaked to the press, but, you know, we don't know if it's a done deal yet.

1170
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Uh, apparently one person said it's 90% finished, it's not a matter of when, it's if, and so on.

1171
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Some of the other big games that Obsidian's worked on, Knights of the Old Republic II, Fallout New Vegas, and of course Pillars of Eternity.

1172
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:16,000
So, um, yeah, uh, of course Microsoft gave the good old, we do not comment on rumors or speculation when they were called out on it.

1173
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:23,000
But, I mean, where there's smoke, there's fire, apparently there's three different sources cluing in that this is happening and this could be a pretty, pretty big deal.

1174
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Uh, what do you think?

1175
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I think it's, I mean, it's not unexpected because they've been purchasing a ton of different studios. I'd just like to see what's coming out of all these studio purchases.

1176
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Well, I don't think we'll know that for a little bit. You know, we won't really know until the next box, whenever that is, but it's interesting nonetheless.

1177
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Uh, I love Obsidian's response to this, by the way. Obsidian said, unfortunately we don't comment on rumors or speculation other than to say that the Rumors album by Fleetwood Max still holds up.

1178
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
That was their official comment.

1179
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,000
That's hilarious.

1180
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:09,000
It's a bummer Lindsey Buckingham ain't touring with them and Fleetwood Max is just in the year 2018. They are just as much of a dramatic mess as they were back in the day.

1181
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:16,000
This is what happens when you're in your 70s and you do a lot of drugs. Alright, let's move on. Loki.

1182
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Alright, so the Brazilian government is calling for the removal of some, um, violent far right games from Steam.

1183
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:38,000
So they have, you know, right now there's been this whole thing on Steam where they just said, listen, we're not gonna really police anything unless it's, you know, straight up trolling, but we're just gonna let everything on to the service.

1184
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,000
And because of that, now you're getting all sorts of, like, weird shit on there.

1185
01:47:43,000 --> 01:48:03,000
So there's this thing called, um, Bolsamido 2K18 where you play as, um, Bolsonaro and he punches and stomps on black LGBTQ and political rival protesters.

1186
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,000
So you're beating up minorities and stuff like that.

1187
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:17,000
And basically, you know, there's this whole thing in the beginning, defeat the communistic evils in this disrespectful game and be the hero that will free the nation from misery.

1188
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:23,000
It just sounds like more trash that they've unloaded on Steam. More garbage.

1189
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:36,000
But I think it's interesting that now the government is stepping in, basically telling Steam, like, I mean, not our government, but the Brazilian government is stepping in to basically tell Steam to fucking, like, clean up their shop. You know what I mean?

1190
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Basically because they're, you know, saying this can, like, incite violence or, you know, it's just that they're promoting this type of thing.

1191
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
That Steam by selling it is promoting it.

1192
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Which, yeah, I mean, you can't really argue that they're not promoting this stuff because they're, you're allowing it on your marketplace.

1193
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:03,000
It's essentially, as I've heard the descriptions, like, if you're allowing, like, people to bring in, like, feces and place it on your store shelves.

1194
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,000
It's like you went to your favorite supermarket and people are just placing-

1195
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Wait, you don't see that at Walmart today?

1196
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:13,000
You're placing just, like, straight up feces in a box, you know, on the store shelves.

1197
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:24,000
And they're like, yeah, we're cool with that, you know, I mean, you can't be upset when someone says you can't put feces on your store shelves and sell it as food.

1198
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
There's rules and laws against that.

1199
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:31,000
We have, we have, it's gonna violate some health codes or something, so you can't do that, you know.

1200
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:37,000
That's, that's basically what the Steam storefront is right now. It's just they're letting anything out with our-

1201
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Wait a second! Is that trolling? No, it's not trolling, it's feces. Oh, okay, that's-

1202
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Fifth Dream in chat says, feces are us. Why not?

1203
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:51,000
And Sia Tabiri, of course, mentions, usually that's in a plastic bag and in the garden section.

1204
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
But it's not being, well, it's being sold as pet food.

1205
01:49:54,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Gotcha, because Target got rid of all their garden sections. I think most Walmarts did too, right? I don't know, anyway, it doesn't matter.

1206
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
New gardens nowadays.

1207
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:18,000
The point is, it's about Steam, and the point is, is that, look, and I get a lot of people are like, we're becoming too politically correct in our society and people are so sensitive and all this stuff, but like, this is some shit that crosses a very obvious line.

1208
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Like, you know what I mean? Like, this isn't about, like, maybe a tasteless joke or something like that. This is about, like, beating up people that are like, correct me if I'm wrong, this is like beating up minorities and people, like, it's not cool.

1209
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Like, it's like violence and shit. It's not okay. Right?

1210
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Right.

1211
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:46,000
That's what we're talking about in this game. So, and this is why the government of Brazil has stepped in and said, um, no, not in this country, you're not selling this. Which is what they're doing, they're selling that stuff, so.

1212
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
On a side tangent.

1213
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Oh boy.

1214
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,000
That I completely forgot in my gaming week.

1215
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Oh boy.

1216
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,000
I checked out that Naked Fighter game. It is garbage.

1217
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Oh, from last week?

1218
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:15,000
It is garbage, because it's basically, it's like a turn bait, so you create your stupid characters and you put them, like, against each other, and then you watch them fight, and it's the most boring fucking piece of, like, I seriously, like, sat there for a couple minutes, and the fight was still not over yet, and I'm like, this is boring.

1219
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,000
I'm like, this is fucking dumb.

1220
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Only video games can make nudity boring.

1221
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Seriously, it's like, it's like, it made the, it's like, it's dumb. It's so boring at that point. The game is just garbage. Yeah, I get it, hahaha, it's naked people, but the game is garbage.

1222
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:39,000
But isn't that, okay, that's, that's like, any mod, like a Skyrim mod that makes everybody naked, or Mario, I'm sure there's a Mario 64 mod that makes everybody naked and all that stuff.

1223
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Yeah, Bowser in there.

1224
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Anyway, but isn't one of those things where it's like, haha, they're naked, and then it's like, that's it. That's it.

1225
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:54,000
But that never gets boring in Skyrim. Skyrim is a fun game, and adding the nudity on top of that is just the icing of the cake.

1226
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:04,000
But when, when all your cake is just, it's icing, covering feces, you know, then you can't, it's not, that does not make a cake.

1227
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Moving on.

1228
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
I've had it.

1229
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Dragon Quest on the 3DS, or lack thereof, because Dragon Quest XI didn't come out on the 3DS, and, here in this country.

1230
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:23,000
A lot of us were left wondering, well, why? Because it looked kind of awesome with the retro and all this stuff.

1231
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Well, apparently, there's a statement from Yu Miyake, who's the executive producer of the Dragon Quest series, talking about Nintendo 3DS re-releases and saying they were popular in Japan, but they didn't sell as well as they hoped in the West.

1232
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Dragon Quest X hasn't released overseas, says the quote. The 3DS games weren't that popular overseas, and some folks jumped from Dragon Quest VIII all the way to Dragon Quest XI.

1233
01:52:51,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Basically indicating that Dragon Quest IX, which was 3DS exclusive, if I remember correctly, didn't sell that well over here, and may indicate why Dragon Quest XI they didn't feel like doing over here.

1234
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Hopefully still that Switch version is going to end up happening over here, because I know for me, I think I've moved on from the DS to the Switch.

1235
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:23,000
I do kind of wish Nintendo would take the 3DS out back and shoot it already, but I got it a little more when the Switch was first launching, and we weren't sure if it was going to be a success.

1236
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:30,000
But I think it's safe to say now, it's a success, so they can retire the 3DS. It's okay. Let it go.

1237
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:36,000
But we all know that's not happening, because there's still the Luigi's Mansion remake, and lord knows what else.

1238
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:42,000
So, anyway. Fifth dream in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, save it for Switch.

1239
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:47,000
I want to jump back quickly to your last story about the game that got Brazil's attention.

1240
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Cajudo in chat says, the PC argument is bullshit. Us sane people know how to follow work rules, school rules, restaurant rules, movie theater rules, the internet is no different.

1241
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:05,000
It has rules. Follow them. That's a good point. Yes, we have free speech, but I'm sure you all know free speech is A, not freedom from consequence.

1242
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Free speech has nothing to do with the place of private business and so forth. Brazil is a different country with their own laws, and I'm not up to up on their constitution and what governs their country. I apologize.

1243
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
But maybe free speech isn't the same thing there. But anyway.

1244
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Well, I think it's still hate speech.

1245
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Well, my point is, you don't yell fire in a crowded theater, because free speech does not allow you to do that. You know what I mean? You're still in a private place of business, and not only are you breaking all sorts of societal laws, but you're basically, you know, you're being an asshole.

1246
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Don't be an asshole.

1247
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Exactly. If only more people just kind of knew that inherently, right?

1248
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
It's weird that you have to tell somebody.

1249
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:47,000
I know, right? But, I mean, you're raising kids. Do you have to educate your kids? Don't be a little asshole?

1250
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Yes.

1251
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
And it's not always easy, is it?

1252
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Just like, just like my cat. Stop being a little asshole. Unfortunately, the cat doesn't speak English, so it's hard to communicate.

1253
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Yeah, but the cats know that they're being assholes.

1254
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,000
That's true.

1255
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
My cat does that all the time.

1256
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
That's true.

1257
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Like, you'll pay attention to her, you'll pet her, you'll cuddle with her, and she gets up off your lap and then goes, wakes up the kids.

1258
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,000
It's like, what the fuck is your problem?

1259
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Like, scratches at their doors.

1260
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Why are you doing that? I am paying attention. I'm giving you all the things you want. I gave you your food, I gave you your treats.

1261
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,000
And this is the thanks I get.

1262
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:30,000
And instead you're just like, fuck you, I'm scratching at the door. I'm gonna wake them up and piss you off. Ha ha ha ha.

1263
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,000
More treats for me.

1264
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
I don't think she understands what she's supposed to be doing.

1265
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys before we go to the Skype line at OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.

1266
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:48,000
So this is a pretty awesome mod, but there's somebody that made a custom Mario 64 mod called Portal 64.

1267
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:53,000
And it's, like you would think, it's Mario 64 with portals. Think he went portals.

1268
01:55:54,000 --> 01:56:02,000
So it's got all the usual suspects, you know, the portal gun, they've even got like a companion cube that's in one of these.

1269
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:08,000
There's the cores falling around, instead of the castle, Peach's Castle, you have Aperture Labs.

1270
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Still collecting the stars and whatnot, but it's pretty cool, like you can use the portals for different jumps and things.

1271
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:28,000
I'm not sure where you can necessarily download it yet, because I think it's still being worked on, but it's pretty cool to check out.

1272
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:40,000
It was by a guy, Emanuar, I think. I can't see what his YouTube page is here. Yeah, Kaze Emanuar.

1273
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Mods are pretty amazing and the things that people do with them, isn't it?

1274
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Yeah, he calls it Portal 3, but it's basically Portal 64.

1275
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
You wish!

1276
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
It's pretty functional for a mod, I mean, it's pretty awesome, so...

1277
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Yeah, no, that is rad, and it's especially not just that you're modding a current game, but you're going back and you're modding it.

1278
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:05,000
What is it about Mario 64 that that is always, because I feel like just like three months ago...

1279
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Mario 64 Maker, and like...

1280
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
And then the Battle Royale in Mario 64 or something.

1281
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
That was awesome, yeah, the online one.

1282
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Where they put Waluigi in there and all that stuff.

1283
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Nintendo shut that shit down.

1284
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Mario 64 online, it came back though, I think.

1285
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Well, yeah, it's the internet, it's whack-a-mole, Nintendo's C&D is one side because of somewhere else.

1286
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:38,000
It was awesome, I wish, that's something like when they eventually add stuff to, you know, Mario 64 that I hope that they add online functionality or something like that to the Nintendo collection or whatever they're doing.

1287
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
NES library whenever they move past the NES.

1288
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:48,000
That's the type of stuff Nintendo, instead of the Zelda with all the rupees enabled, that's the type of thing they should be doing, huh?

1289
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:58,000
I mean, if some Joe nobody that has no idea how you program the game, I mean, can do it, then why can't you do it? Oh, that's right, because it's online.

1290
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,000
I forgot.

1291
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says there's a neat mod or ROM hack out there that blended Zelda A Link to the Past with Super Metroid and a randomizer.

1292
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:20,000
You know, those randomizers are really the rage on Twitch. I was watching our buddy Breslil streaming Zelda randomizer. It was this morning or last night, one of those things.

1293
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Yeah, it was weird because like it basically made like any shop or level entrance could be anything. Like you might go to the level entrance for level one and it's the old lady who gives you a letter or something like completely different.

1294
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
So he has to actually hunt around for the different levels. It was interesting.

1295
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Yeah, normally the ones I've seen with the randomizers haven't been with the doors. It was just the items in the chest. The chests were all randomized, so you might go someplace where you might get the sword, you might get something else.

1296
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Would that work though? Because wasn't Zelda sort of built where like you have to have the item in one dungeon to get to the next dungeon?

1297
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Like the original Zelda?

1298
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Yeah. I thought that was a thing.

1299
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Maybe. They might have some sort of safe guards for that, but this is A Link to the Past is what I was talking about.

1300
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Oh, oh, oh, okay. Gotcha. Oh yeah, I've seen The Link to the Past randomizer. I have seen that.

1301
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Yeah, but The Link to the Past randomizer though with Super Metroid would be awesome. I hope we see the next one or either the upcoming Game of Summer Quick or Summer Game of Summer Quick.

1302
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:26,000
They're just throwing all this stuff in a blender now, seeing what they can come up with. It's pretty cool though. I like all this like retro stuff.

1303
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:36,000
I do wish Nintendo kind of officially embraced this a little more. Maybe this whole Zelda thing that they did on the Switch is them kind of showing like we might be open to something a little different.

1304
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Can you imagine if Nintendo like fully embraced like a Zelda randomizer as a thing? That would be fucking rad.

1305
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,000
It would be.

1306
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:52,000
I think people would be really into that. And then it would also, instead of all these unofficial hacks and stuff out there, not that there's anything wrong with that because the community's created a beautiful thing,

1307
01:59:53,000 --> 02:00:00,000
but for Nintendo to like officially endorse that and take that on would create a benchmark. Imagine allowing like mod support for some of these games.

1308
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Like maybe not, you know, maybe we can police it where it's not like nudie mods and shit, but it's just like, you know, these randomizers.

1309
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:14,000
What about the good things mods did? More difficult maps or different maps like brand new maps or something.

1310
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Yeah. Yeah. All right. Anyhow, our last story tonight before we open up the Skype line, although I will go to Loki for last minute news too.

1311
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Uh, guess what? A new company has started a gaming division. Uh, that's right. There's apparently a KFC gaming. That's right. Kentucky Fried Chicken.

1312
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,000
They did have that weird VR game.

1313
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Is getting into gaming. All right. Uh, and of course a lot of people are kind of doing, oh, this is a throwback. Remember Yo Noid on the NES, which was, that was Domino's thing years ago, right?

1314
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Yeah. Or Cool Spot on the Super NES. Cool Spot was on, or actually it was on Genesis too.

1315
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:58,000
One of the greatest games they ever released on Xbox 360, Sneak King, Limburger Kings games.

1316
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:07,000
All their games are awesome. I only have Pocket Bike Racer. I don't know what happened to my Sneak King. I would have never sold it, so I don't know what happened.

1317
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Man, Sneak King was so good. So anyway.

1318
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:17,000
It was great. They should have put out more games. Come on, come on guys. Like I'd even settle for like a Sneak King mobile game.

1319
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:23,000
So anyway, apparently KFC now has a gaming division, so maybe we're going to see some type of game from them in the future.

1320
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:32,000
And then this particular story has a picture of the new spokesperson for the new Colonel Sanders, who I believe, isn't that Reba? That's Reba McEntire that plays the Colonel now.

1321
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:38,000
I thought she was a few, I don't know. I can't keep track of who's playing the Colonel nowadays, but I know she was.

1322
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,000
It's always changing.

1323
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,000
It is.

1324
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:49,000
So anyway, we'll see what game. What game could Kentucky Fried Chicken come up with?

1325
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:54,000
By the way, I'm going to open up the Skype line over Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.

1326
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:02,000
The phone lines are open. If you want to do it the old fashioned way, 1-877-GAME-OLR. But Skype's probably better. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1327
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:08,000
But I was going to say, what kind of game would you want to see KFC make?

1328
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:14,000
How about a Mario Kart game, but you're racing drumsticks?

1329
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:22,000
I would want to see whatever crazy shit they could come up with. Because remember, they had the whole VR game that was supposed to be a training game.

1330
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:29,000
That was fucking weird. And I'm down with the fucking weird. If it's fast food, make it as strange as fucking possible.

1331
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Bob Coffey in chat suggests KFC versus Taco Bell.

1332
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:39,000
I don't need a versus game. Unless it's a fighting game, in which case I'm down with the mascots fighting.

1333
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Doesn't the same parent company own KFC, Taco Bell, and I think Pizza Hut are all the same number.

1334
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Oh yeah, that's right. They're all Pepsi. Pepsi man. He runs everything.

1335
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:56,000
There's the secret. It's like the final boss you have to get in the game. I thought I saw a call coming through, but then it disappeared.

1336
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:00,000
But the Skype line is open at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1337
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Dark Tutsi is saying BK did a racing game, if I recall correctly, and yeah, that was the one you owned, right?

1338
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Anyway, we do have a call, so let's go to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1339
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Hey, what's going on everybody? It's Rama.

1340
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Hey Rama, buddy. How you doing?

1341
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:16,000
I'm doing pretty good. How about you?

1342
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,000
I am fantastic. What's on your mind tonight?

1343
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:27,000
A few things, and I'll be on my merry little way. Now, if you tune into our show over at Anime Jam Session, if you listen, sometimes throughout the episode,

1344
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:31,000
you will hear Mako Chan's cat, Damien, scream his little head off.

1345
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:35,000
I'm glad it's not just us that's having cat issues during the show.

1346
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:43,000
No. It's like when we're doing our How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, sometimes as we're going through our routine, you'll hear this cat meowing.

1347
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,000
We all stop and go, hi, Damien.

1348
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:50,000
And that's because the cat wants to play on How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

1349
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Something like that, plus he's putting himself right on Mako Chan's shoulders going, my human.

1350
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
I missed that segment. That's what we used to call it, you know?

1351
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Yeah.

1352
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Back before OLR was strictly video games, we used to call it How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

1353
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Well, like I said, a lot of what Anime Jam Session does is heavily inspired by OLR, which, as I've said, we're like the bratty kid, sister, kid, brother of the show.

1354
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:21,000
And I love it, but I'm also speaking to you through that cat.

1355
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
And I believe it, every single minute of it.

1356
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
What else is on your mind, buddy?

1357
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Now, I know Loki mentioned DDR earlier, so I gotta know. What is y'all's go-to song for DDR?

1358
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:39,000
It's Rainin' Men by Jerry Howell. No, that's what you want me to say. That's what you want me to say.

1359
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:48,000
No, it depends what mix I'm playing. I always liked the ones that were very, like, constant stream of notes was a good warm-up.

1360
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:54,000
So when Fourth Mix was All the Rage, I always thought Kick the Can was a great warm-up song.

1361
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:58,000
You know, obviously, for one, it's got that great little...

1362
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:04,000
You know, it's obviously the old, you know, classic tune that's incorporated in the dance song.

1363
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
But it was just like that constant stream of eighth notes made, like, a really good warm-up song.

1364
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:11,000
But that song isn't around in newer mixes.

1365
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,000
It was like Fourth Mix and Fourth Mix.

1366
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Yeah, but that was, like, my go-to warm-up. I used to do Ghosts when that was available, when we had a max machine.

1367
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:24,000
But that's no longer available. I'm not sure what I would do on an Extreme machine these days.

1368
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Because that's the machine that you have in your house, right? You have a Dance Dance Revolution Extreme?

1369
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Yes.

1370
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Do you have, like, a same go-to starter song that you do every day?

1371
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Well, I play non-stop random mixes, so it's whatever comes up.

1372
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:42,000
So if I'm playing just, like, actual songs, I don't know, it just depends what kind of a mood I'm in.

1373
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:53,000
I mean, usually I like Last Message or 1998's Pretty Good or Dance Dance Revolution.

1374
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,000
You know what song?

1375
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Fantasy.

1376
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:01,000
You know what song I will still rock in DDR Extreme to this day? My answer? Butterfly.

1377
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,000
I can see it.

1378
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:09,000
The butterfly steps are really, I play that once in a while because it'll come up on my, the non-stop or whatever.

1379
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:17,000
But, like, the steps for doubles are kind of, they're mirrored. So, like, you do one pattern and it mirrors it and you do it again.

1380
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,000
It's just, like, it's kind of boring.

1381
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Kick the Can would be my real answer, though, if it's a machine that has that.

1382
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,000
I like that.

1383
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Oh, and I also like, what was the other one? So In Love has actually got some pretty fun steps to play.

1384
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
I don't know.

1385
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Man, y'all want me to get a DDR machine. This is making me want to get a DDR machine more and more, but, you know, it's just not in the cards right now, maybe in the future.

1386
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Well, I mean, you could kind of build your own step mania machine and just kind of make your way up, you know?

1387
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Yeah, I guess that's true. You know, it'd be about kind of getting, it's all about that right dance pad that isn't going to, like, fuck up your floor.

1388
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:01,000
If you want to spend a ton of money, you can always buy the step mania, step maniac ones.

1389
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Well, at that point, why not just buy the fucking game?

1390
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Yeah, you're probably surprised.

1391
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Honestly. That's my thought, anyway.

1392
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,000
So true, so true.

1393
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Yeah, ask your 200 Matt in our chat over at live.voguenetwork.com. Absolutely right, it will be Mr. Smoosh's DDR machine. That is absolutely right.

1394
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Surprisingly enough, my cat does not give a shit about the DDR machine.

1395
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Really?

1396
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Yeah, she does not lay on it.

1397
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Does the cat not enjoy the garage, maybe?

1398
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:33,000
She loves the garage. She likes sleeping in a paint tray that's in our, like, our shelving. We, like, store our paints in, like, a shelving unit.

1399
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:40,000
So she's hidden back there and she'll sleep in those, like, a paint tray. Not the four beds we have in the house, but the paint tray.

1400
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:44,000
But she won't touch the cabinet. She won't sleep near it or anything.

1401
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:52,000
I think it's because it's too cold. She likes the warmth, especially in the summer. Like, it's like 100 degrees out there and she'll go to sleep out there.

1402
02:07:52,000 --> 02:08:02,000
Even in the winter, though, she'll come out there sometimes and sleep. But no, never touches the machine. But once again, I think it's because it's all metal and it's cold. So she won't, doesn't like it.

1403
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Interesting. Anything else on your mind tonight, Rama?

1404
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:19,000
One more thing, and we'll be on our merry little way. On the anime jam session, we understand some of the issues and how some things in OLR and gaming can cross over with anime and anime jam session.

1405
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:26,000
So in regards to YYR's email, we will gladly sponsor This Week and Bowsette for Orange Lounge Radio.

1406
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Have a great night, Rama. It was good to hear from you.

1407
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:45,000
I just, I just don't understand why it's everywhere. It's like you can't escape it. Like, somebody showed me a fucking video. It was like, they took New Super Mario Brothers Wii or whatever.

1408
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:52,000
It was one of the New Super Mario Brothers games in the level where Bowser chases you in the castle and they made it Bowsette. Why? Because they can.

1409
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:56,000
There's also a mod for Breath of the Wild where you can play as Bowsette.

1410
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Yippee!

1411
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:19,000
I can't explain it. Sometimes I can't. Sometimes I can't. It's just something that everybody is loving and, you know, last week there was a comic somebody drew of all the popular meme waifus telling Bowsette, enjoy your 15 minutes of fame while you can before you get tossed in the trash.

1412
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Put me in that picture.

1413
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Breath of the Wild's footage. Her dress is doing some weird physics, man. That's all I gotta say.

1414
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:30,000
SSJ100Matt in our chat points out the real exciting news of the week is that Rob will be coming back to New York City soon.

1415
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Yes, with the news that Lady Gaga may be in a Broadway play, my good Judy Victoria down in LA is like, we're going. We're going to New York City. We're gonna see this fucking play with Gaga. If it's true.

1416
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:48,000
And they haven't officially announced that yet, but I'm really overdue for a New York visit. Allen's never been and he really wants to go sometimes.

1417
02:09:48,000 --> 02:10:00,000
So I think Toronto's like for sure next year and I really want to work in New York City. I'm not going to do MAGFest, which I know is sad, but that frees me up to be able to do some other stuff. So that's kind of the thought process there.

1418
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:07,000
I'm perfectly okay with that because Mako-chan wants to meet you and Allen. She wants to add you two to her collection.

1419
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Ah, well, I'm already an honorary member, I would hope. But yes, officially it would be nice.

1420
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Yes. Remember, there was an episode way back when of Ask Orange Lodge where she did ask, but now a picture or two together, it'll be official.

1421
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Yeah, we'll make it official. We will. We'll get ring pops and everything.

1422
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Don't give her any ideas. You don't know.

1423
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Look out, bitch. I'll get her a Bowser crown. Then you'll really be sorry for inflicting that on the internet.

1424
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Cosplay's daisy to my Luigi. Don't give her more of a inflated head than she already has.

1425
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:51,000
SS 2100 Matt says, it's been over 10 years since Rob has come to New York. I had hair when Rob was in New York last. So did I.

1426
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Anyway, I'm going to let you go. Thanks for the call.

1427
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Take care, bros.

1428
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to get through.

1429
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Loki, any last minute stories?

1430
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Well, you took both my Bowser stories. I guess I can't read them.

1431
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Gosh, I'm so upset.

1432
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Oh, darn. So I guess the annual annual desert bus for hope is starting going to be soon.

1433
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:24,000
November 9th, they're going to be starting at 10 a.m. and apparently they're starting their fundraising.

1434
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:34,000
So last year they raised six hundred fifty thousand dollars or one hundred fifty eight hours for Child's Play.

1435
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
So maybe they'll top it again. We'll see.

1436
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Good cause.

1437
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Yep. And then, of course, the Mortal Kombat trilogy apparently is having a fan remake.

1438
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Apparently people are redoing the graphics in the game, doing like an HD remaster type of thing.

1439
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Why? I don't get it. Are they redigitizing the characters or something?

1440
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:59,000
I. Yeah, it looks like they might be doing that or like I don't know if they're filming different characters or something.

1441
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:03,000
What they're doing is there says the fan project has been under development since 2011.

1442
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:10,000
It started as a Mugen project and it's not going to be one soon.

1443
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:17,000
This is a pixel perfect arcade remake of the original Mortal Kombat trilogy using new 3D models created from the original Mortal Kombat games.

1444
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:22,000
From all of the behind the scenes clips from massive scale.

1445
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Oh, because Tobias or Boone, one of those guys on Twitter, was putting out like videos of the motion capture from back in the day.

1446
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:37,000
So somebody must have picked that up and was like, we can make HD video out of this.

1447
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,000
That's interesting. Wow.

1448
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Yeah. So Tiger Claw actually links video of the HD remakes.

1449
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:49,000
I kind of want to see this. I don't like to usually play YouTube's live on air, but we're running a little short tonight.

1450
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:51,000
So I'll play play this.

1451
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Wow. That does look really good compared to the original.

1452
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Yeah. They kind of went back and redid the backgrounds.

1453
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:03,000
That's the other important part.

1454
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Like they totally went back and redid those backgrounds.

1455
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:12,000
So this is a Scorpion and Sub-Zero, which obviously is just the same with a palette swap.

1456
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:16,000
But they're in that stage where Shang Tsung is sitting in the background.

1457
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Huh. Okay. I got to give it to him.

1458
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:24,000
That looks pretty fricking good. Ooh, where's the fatality? Ooh, the fatalities at the end.

1459
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Gross.

1460
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Wow. They made that HD too.

1461
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Okay.

1462
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Curious to see what they come up with there. Thanks for that leak for YouTube. That's the first I've heard of that.

1463
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Yeah. So it was pretty neat.

1464
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Well, one more call for calls to see if anybody wants to get through Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1465
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Anything else for last minute stories?

1466
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Someone's trying to remake the single player campaign of Goldeneye in Unreal 4.

1467
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
Again? Didn't we have a remake on like the Wii?

1468
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
Well, we have like an official remake that we did.

1469
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,000
But no, this is someone else doing it now.

1470
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,000
All right. Fair enough.

1471
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Well, Goldeneye is one of those things where it's like I play, or not me personally, but I've heard people say I play first person shooters because of Goldeneye.

1472
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Like Goldeneye got me into this. So, you know, people have a lot of love for that game.

1473
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:15,000
So I'm not surprised people want to go back and play the classic.

1474
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Why don't we have a Goldeneye Battle Royale game yet?

1475
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Guys are slow.

1476
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Licensing nightmare. That's the problem.

1477
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:24,000
Oh, fan game. Licensing.

1478
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Yeah, but they can't call it Goldeneye. And if you don't call it Goldeneye, people are going to be like, Golden Spy.

1479
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:40,000
What would you call it? Jim Band Golden Spy.

1480
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
I don't know what you'd do. Anyway.

1481
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:51,000
All right. Well, I guess nobody else is trying to call. So that's it. That's going to do it for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio.

1482
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
A little bit shorter, but that's the way it goes sometimes. Some weeks are bigger than others.

1483
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
We'll be back in seven days to do it all over again.

1484
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:02,000
But in the meantime, I'm going to say, as I always do, thank you so much for listening to the show.

1485
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Thank you for taking time out of your week to be here with us on Sunday night.

1486
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Or if you're listening to us on the podcast feed, that's always appreciated as well.

1487
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:13,000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show and help us spread the word.

1488
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here to air, then what are we going to do?

1489
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:25,000
So, yeah, there's that. That's it. That's all I have to say. Loki, any final thoughts for you tonight?

1490
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:34,000
My final thought is that hopefully I'm going to be streaming on Twitch soon, so just waiting on my hardware to come in.

1491
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:36,000
That's exciting. Sure is.

1492
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:40,000
And hopefully the bandwidth can hold all that.

1493
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:45,000
And then my final thought is I need to be streaming on Twitch more. I haven't done it in a few days.

1494
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:50,000
And it's just, you know, real life gets in the way. I do it where I can, though. It happens.

1495
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:55,000
But then I'll be like, oh, I'm going to get sucked into another MMO or another Facebook game or something like that.

1496
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
And then it's like, whoops, I haven't been streaming lately. Oops, my bad.

1497
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Anyway, but we will be back in seven days. That's the one thing we will be doing, is we always do another episode of OLR in seven days.

1498
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Dark Sakura, I think, is still working next week, so she won't be here, but we will have you guys here.

1499
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:13,000
And who knows, maybe we'll try to find a fun guest to bring us to. That was a lot of fun with Delvin last week.

1500
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
So we'll hopefully have some more third chairs sitting in with us in the coming week.

1501
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Anyway, that's going to do it for another episode of OLR. Thanks for being here, and we'll see you next time.

1502
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:22,000
Have a great week. Happy gaming.

02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
