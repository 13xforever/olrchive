7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	16000	Strike one down and another two pop up in its place
16000	19000	That's the story of how PUBG has banned 13 million accounts and counting
19000	23000	Cheaters and scammers know no bounds, but we've got better news of new content coming soon
23000	27000	Stay tuned for this and plenty more starting right now on the show, wherever Gamer has a voice
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	34000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back
34000	36000	It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
36000	38000	Orange Lounge Radio
38000	43000	Live tonight, episode number 747 for this, October the 7th, 2018
43000	47000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here in Sacramento, California
47000	49000	Studio N7, where our show is based
49000	53000	Live for the next few hours, talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
53000	58000	With you guys in our live chat, as well as my co-hosts here in studio, say hello to Loki
58000	59000	Hello
59000	60000	How are you, Loki?
60000	61000	I'm good
61000	63000	Good, you're eating Korean BBQ on the show tonight
63000	64000	Yes
64000	68000	Yes, which is not something you usually get, because I thought Korean BBQ was very expensive
68000	69000	It is
69000	72000	There must be something very specific you were craving tonight
72000	76000	It's the bulgogi beef, but the problem is though, the bulgogi that you get with Takeout
76000	81000	Is not the same as the bulgogi that you cook at a Korean BBQ
81000	86000	It's like, it's thicker, it's covered with tons of barbecue teriyaki sauce
86000	88000	This was dry
88000	92000	Thankfully I ordered an extra side of teriyaki sauce
92000	94000	Thank gosh, thank gosh
94000	95000	So
95000	99000	That's funny because you had Korean BBQ, I had bulgogi BBQ
99000	102000	So it's like BBQ city tonight
102000	109000	And then a couple nights ago, I had Lucille's BBQ, the more southern BBQ type of stuff
109000	110000	Mmm
110000	111000	BBQ
111000	112000	We've just seen a BBQ fusion restaurant
112000	114000	That's right, there's BBQ with some orange entrees tonight
114000	115000	All of the BBQ
115000	116000	All of the BBQ, anyway
116000	118000	Dark Sakura, she is still out on leave
118000	121000	She'll be joining us a little later in the show for the Classic Game of the Week
121000	124000	But we do have someone else here in studio with us tonight
124000	128000	To help us along with Dark Sakura's absence
128000	132000	I'm very happy to welcome him to the show because I know he's been listening for a while
132000	134000	And he has a show of his own which is fantastic
134000	137000	And he came a very long way to be here
137000	140000	So all the way from Toronto, say hello everybody to Delvin
140000	141000	Hello
141000	142000	How are you?
142000	143000	I'm really good
143000	146000	So you have a show called Video Game Realness
146000	147000	That is correct
147000	150000	Well it's not your show, you're your friends
150000	151000	Yeah, it's a group of friends
151000	153000	It's a group of friends that all do it together
153000	155000	Tell us a little bit about Video Game Realness
155000	158000	So we started about 5 years ago I want to say now
158000	159000	You see a boat
160000	170000	And so, yeah, 5 years ago it's me, one of my old roommates Cameron and my two friends James and Michael
170000	174000	We just shoot the shit talking about video games because we used to do it all the time
174000	176000	Going to dinner and stuff
176000	180000	One day we just decided let's just put this on tape and record it
180000	182000	This sounds so familiar
182000	184000	Doesn't this sound familiar, Loki?
184000	185000	Yeah
185000	187000	So yeah, we
187000	188000	No, I love it
188000	191000	We just get together, talk about video games
191000	197000	It's usually quite random and quite stupid and silly but that's just how we are
197000	201000	Yeah, actually I loved, you know, again I would encourage folks to go listen to Video Game Realness
201000	203000	Although I notice your episodes are kind of sporadic
203000	204000	Yes
204000	205000	You just kind of do them when you feel like it
205000	210000	Yeah, we're on a regular schedule but, you know, life gets in the way and now we just do it when there's something to talk about
210000	213000	I respect that, I respect that but I will say, not to give away all your jokes
213000	217000	But on the most recent episode, something that had me rolling, you already know this
217000	222000	Was you guys were talking about the new Switch game that's coming out, Starlink
222000	223000	Yes
223000	224000	Which is Ubisoft's game
224000	225000	Yes
225000	230000	But we keep seeing all these in the trailers and in the Nintendo Directs
230000	232000	They're like, Star Fox is in Starlink
232000	233000	Yeah
233000	235000	So finish this joke here
236000	243000	So basically, every time Nintendo talks about the game, they pretty much promote it as a Star Fox game
243000	244000	Right
244000	246000	And I don't know what the game's about
246000	250000	I mean, they might kind of say it by Ubisoft, you know, they just kind of like skim over the details
250000	251000	Yeah
251000	255000	Yeah, so there's this comic out there, James had shared it with our group
255000	260000	I don't know the origin of the comic but basically it's like in three parts or whatever
260000	265000	Where someone had basically, was handing something to someone saying, I made this, right?
265000	269000	And then, but the person takes it and then says, no, I made this
269000	273000	So basically we considered this the same situation with Starlink
273000	274000	Right
274000	278000	Where Ubisoft has made the game and Nintendo has now just taken it and said, no, I made this
278000	280000	You made this? I made this
280000	284000	Yeah, yeah, just slapped Star Fox in there and now it's just Star Fox
284000	285000	That's right
285000	287000	Like, who knows what the game's about
287000	289000	The question is, is the game any good?
289000	291000	Who knows, who cares, it's a Star Fox game
291000	292000	It's a Star Fox game now
292000	293000	How dare you, don't ask these questions
293000	299000	Because all of the Nintendo tie-ins have been successful, you know, just like they did with what, the last Skylanders game
299000	302000	Did you buy it because it had Nintendo tie-ins in it?
302000	303000	No
303000	304000	No, no, I didn't
304000	305000	Because no one gives a shit about that
305000	306000	I sure did
306000	308000	And this is another choice of life game with a Nintendo tie-in that
308000	312000	You know what else I didn't buy was the one with Gamelan on Philips CD-i
312000	317000	So not every Nintendo crossover is successful, but some are kind of cool, so you never know
317000	321000	We'll see where this one goes, but I think it's pretty much a Star Fox game
321000	322000	Yeah
322000	323000	With some other characters
323000	324000	I made this
324000	325000	You don't know
325000	327000	I'll let video game realness hold the joke, I'll stop stealing it
327000	332000	They could have one of Gamelan, Link as a, you know, echo fighter in the next Smash Brothers game
332000	338000	I just, I think there's like a sense of pride that would never be violated by doing that in Smash Brothers
338000	342000	I really think so, I think Nintendo would really rather forget that ever happened
342000	343000	Or Linkette
344000	346000	Stop it right now
346000	347000	Alright, anyway
347000	350000	Go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
350000	354000	Because like I said earlier, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network
354000	355000	vognetwork.com
355000	359000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
359000	362000	And going into our chat room, Tigerclaw says
362000	365000	Starling on the Switch is basically a new Star Fox game
365000	367000	That's exactly what Nintendo wants you to think
367000	368000	It's not
368000	370000	Please, stop making excuses for them
370000	372000	They need to make their own Star Fox game
372000	374000	I made this, I made this
374000	378000	However though, I'm completely fine with them not making their own F-Zero game
378000	382000	Because when it was Nintendo and Namco, that turned out just fine
382000	386000	Oh, that was the Triforce, that was Sega as well, wasn't that too
386000	391000	Yes, because Sega and Namco both know racing games, Nintendo, they have F-Zero
391000	393000	Nintendo makes great characters, alright anyway
393000	399000	Tigerclaw says what's interesting though, in the cutscenes that show Star Fox, or excuse me, Fox with a human
399000	403000	Fox is pretty short, he looks to be about 4 feet tall next to a human
403000	408000	And S.J. 100 Matt is calling out a few minutes in and Loki is already going after Nintendo
408000	410000	And which I oppose is sorry I'm late
413000	416000	Anyway, Delvin, I don't mean to take the spotlight off of you and video game realness
416000	420000	So you've been listening, I know, to OLR for a little while, which you know, thank you very much
420000	425000	But we got connected back when GamerX was kind of like coming up
425000	426000	Correct
426000	433000	Because we were trying to find other LGBTQIA plus, you know, all the colors of the rainbow
433000	438000	We were trying to find people to kind of connect with to propose a podcasting panel at GamerX
438000	442000	Which we did end up doing, but sadly you guys didn't make it to GamerX
442000	444000	Yeah, we couldn't make it out to the
444000	447000	But at least we still got connected, so that was the important part
447000	450000	That was the win in that situation, which was really cool
450000	452000	Yeah, so that was a while ago now
452000	456000	Because they did four years of GamerX and the last GamerX was like two years ago
456000	458000	So that was like six years ago
458000	460000	Crazy! So awesome
460000	463000	Tell me a little bit about why you're a gaming fan
463000	470000	What do you remember early on that like a gaming memory that made you a gaming fan?
470000	474000	Well, I got into gaming from a very young age
474000	476000	I think I was five or six
476000	478000	I got the NES for Christmas
478000	484000	And my sister and I, we didn't really know like what a Nintendo was
484000	486000	We'd kind of seen it in commercials or whatever
486000	488000	And then we got it for Christmas one year
488000	493000	And so my parents had this one box that we couldn't open
493000	496000	And so they left it there, and then they gave us this one box to open
496000	499000	If you open that box, Santa's gonna burn down the house
499000	500000	Yeah, kinda
500000	503000	So they gave us this one box to open and it was a joystick
503000	506000	And so we were like, well, why are you giving us a joystick?
506000	510000	And then we looked at the box and we just started clawing at it
510000	512000	And we were screaming and going crazy
512000	516000	And so that was like the moment when gaming started for me essentially
516000	519000	And they're like, no, I told you not to open it, now you don't get it
519000	523000	And it turns out the joystick was for a lawnmower that was in the box
523000	525000	Now go do the chores
525000	527000	No, it was a Nintendo in there
527000	530000	So at that time it was just NES games
530000	532000	We only had Mario
532000	539000	But my aunt, who lived in Texas at the time, had sent us a bunch of games from the US
539000	542000	Because they were a lot cheaper here in the US than it was in Canada
542000	545000	And one of those games that she sent was Mega Man 2
545000	549000	Which is my most favorite game of all time
549000	552000	I was gonna ask that because I know you're a big Mega Man fan
552000	556000	Like so much that Mega Man appears in your online presence
556000	559000	Correct, my gamertag, Mega Man X400
559000	563000	So tell us a little bit about this Mega Man love
563000	565000	Where does that come from?
565000	568000	It really just started from Mega Man 2
568000	570000	And I've always enjoyed the Mega Man series
570000	574000	It took me forever to actually beat Mega Man 2 as a kid
574000	577000	And then when I finally got it, it just clicked with me
577000	580000	And then that evolved into liking the X series
580000	582000	Which is my favorite of the Mega Man games
582000	584000	Which I've played through all of them
584000	586000	And they're just really fun
586000	589000	And they have great replayability and great challenge
589000	592000	You can play it in any which way you like
592000	594000	To make it more difficult if you want
594000	597000	You can try to speedrun it if you want or just play it for shits and giggles
597000	600000	I gotta ask you your thoughts on Mega Man 11
600000	602000	Although you probably haven't really had to play it yet
602000	604000	Because you've been out here, right?
604000	607000	Well I did play the demo
607000	610000	I played the demo at Fan Expo
610000	612000	Which is a big convention in Toronto
612000	615000	And so that was a lot of fun playing it there
615000	618000	I did get to play some of it on the plane right here
618000	620000	And it's great
620000	623000	Honestly, I think they did a really good job of this game
623000	626000	It was long overdue
626000	628000	Long, long overdue
628000	631000	I'm glad that they didn't go in the direction they did with Mega Man 9 and 10
631000	634000	With going back to the old retro design
634000	637000	They seem to have found a nice hybrid
637000	640000	Maybe it's not retro, but it looks like the old game
641000	645000	They didn't try to make it ultra fancy or force 3D in it
645000	648000	No, it has a good style to it
648000	650000	It's still in the original Mega Man series
650000	656000	But it is not the old Mega Man 2, 3, 4 style
656000	659000	With the NES 8-bit style
659000	661000	That they did with 9 and 10
661000	663000	Which I didn't quite like
663000	666000	It now has 4 different difficulty levels
666000	668000	Which I think is really good
668000	672000	It has super beginner, casual, normal, and then hardcore
672000	675000	Wait a minute, so you got hardcore for ultra
675000	677000	Is that going to be your mode at some point?
677000	679000	No, I'm just normal
679000	682000	So then you have slightly irritating
682000	684000	Which is normal
684000	685000	That would be your mode
685000	687000	So then you have casual
687000	690000	And so then we even have below that Bobby Black Wolf mode
690000	692000	Beginner
692000	694000	No, it's ok, he's in on the joke
694000	696000	It's fine, it's fine
697000	700000	The most basic of basic levels was made for Bobby Black Wolf
700000	701000	And it's fine
701000	703000	So basically what happens in beginner mode is
703000	705000	You almost take no damage
705000	708000	And if you fall, a little bird comes and picks you up
708000	710000	And puts you onto the next platform
710000	712000	So you can just get through the level
712000	714000	Oh my god, I love it
714000	715000	It's super easy
715000	717000	Ok, that's awesome
717000	721000	I know one place maybe some of the OLR listeners may have seen you before
721000	724000	If they don't participate with video game realness right now
724000	726000	They may be familiar with your Twitch
726000	728000	Because I know you and I have done co-streams
728000	730000	We've done Mario Kart
730000	733000	We did Mario Kart and we played 20XX
733000	736000	Which is not Mega Man
736000	739000	I remember when I streamed that game for the first time
739000	741000	You came into the chat and you were like
741000	743000	What is this?
743000	746000	I had no idea about the game until I saw you play it
746000	748000	And I purchased it immediately
748000	750000	And it is a really good game
750000	752000	And I generally don't like the
752000	754000	Roguelike style of gaming
754000	756000	Where you have to start all over again
756000	758000	But they do this one in a really good way
758000	760000	That incorporates the Mega Man style of playing
760000	762000	In with a roguelike
762000	764000	Which is really good
764000	766000	So tell us a little more about your Twitch
766000	768000	You're streaming right?
768000	771000	So I do stream rather passively right now
771000	774000	Because there hasn't been very much games to stream
774000	776000	But there's a whole slew of games coming out
776000	778000	Between now and when Smash Brothers comes out
778000	780000	So you'll be seeing me stream a lot more
780000	782000	On twitch.tv slash vgrealness
782000	784000	Nice! Love it
784000	786000	And by the way Bobby is speaking up in chat
786000	788000	He wants us to know
788000	790000	I didn't even beat beginner frown
790000	792000	There was this one platforming section
792000	794000	That was an autoscroller and I could never get through it
794000	796000	It was the one with destructible blocks
796000	798000	Oh yeah I had that trouble too
798000	800000	Because our Switch controllers
800000	802000	My kids busted them
802000	804000	Well they're not busted
804000	806000	But they occasionally drift
806000	808000	For no reason
809000	811000	No it's not even
811000	813000	I don't even think it's the kids that did it
813000	815000	I think it's just their controllers are pieces of shit
815000	817000	Is what it is
817000	819000	I've actually seen a lot on Twitter about like
819000	821000	Cleaning those controllers
821000	823000	How does dust get in there
823000	825000	In a way that affects analogies
825000	828000	Because I don't have this problem on any other controller
828000	830000	Oh and then the other thing that was fun
830000	832000	Is my kids wanted to play
832000	834000	Super Mario Party
834000	836000	And so you know I thought
836000	838000	They had some nice little additional pieces
838000	840000	That they have for the joy cons
840000	842000	To make them add the little wrist strap
842000	844000	And stuff like that
844000	846000	Those fuckers are nearly impossible to put on
846000	848000	And take off
848000	850000	I don't use them for that reason
850000	852000	What poor fucking design is this shit
852000	854000	Even when you put them on correctly
854000	856000	It's just impossible to take them off
856000	858000	They're pretty tight
858000	860000	Alright anyway what else I want to ask you about
860000	862000	New games that you're into
862000	864000	So we know about Mega Man
864000	866000	What else, I mean I'll get into your gaming week
866000	868000	So we can talk about specifics because you know we do that here
868000	870000	But like in a general sense what are some of the
870000	872000	Recent games you've really enjoyed
872000	874000	The one that I've
874000	876000	Played through the most recently was
876000	878000	Octopath Traveler
878000	880000	Which I know a lot of people
880000	882000	It's kind of a love hate game
882000	884000	Where you either really got into it because you like that style
884000	886000	Of game
886000	888000	But it is lacking in terms of a continuous story
888000	890000	And character development
890000	892000	I think it really did
892000	894000	Have the design sense
894000	896000	Where it was going to be
896000	898000	Made for a mobile game
898000	900000	That you would purchase in packages
900000	902000	Based on the characters that you purchased
902000	904000	I think, was that your show that got into a discussion
904000	906000	On that because I think you guys are apps
906000	908000	I heard that on a podcast somewhere about this game was very
908000	910000	Clearly designed for mobile
910000	912000	And I think that is like on the money
912000	914000	I think it was on the money
914000	916000	And they made efforts to kind of
916000	918000	Make character development later on
918000	920000	But it was very tapped on
920000	922000	But that being said, I do love the battle system
922000	924000	That is where the heart of the game is
924000	926000	And how you can
926000	928000	Do the battles and customize your
928000	930000	Jobs
930000	932000	And you get like advanced jobs later
932000	934000	Which just make it even like super easier
934000	936000	And just even talking with friends and like
936000	938000	Finding out how they beep certain bosses
938000	940000	Versus how I did it and just
940000	942000	There's so many different ways in which you can skin the cat
942000	944000	Basically
944000	946000	Well don't do that
946000	948000	But it's really great
948000	950000	And I'm pretty sure Square Enix will make
950000	952000	A Octopath Battle 2
952000	954000	It ended up selling like
954000	956000	It was the best seller that month in the US
956000	958000	So I'm sure that game really
958000	960000	Exceeded expectations in the US
960000	962000	Specifically
962000	964000	So there's gonna be like a Deca path
964000	966000	I mean I know Deca is 10
966000	968000	But I think we got into this in a previous episode
968000	970000	But there's going to be a sequel
970000	972000	And that will be good because it will give them a chance to really perfect
972000	974000	Now this formula I think
974000	976000	And the only thing they need to do to make a second game
976000	978000	Good is just a story that continues
978000	980000	And keep everything about the battle system
980000	982000	The same because it's
982000	984000	That we know is not going to be piecemeal like in the story
984000	986000	Correct
986000	988000	Make it a joining story and not just eight
988000	990000	Individual stories about people that
990000	992000	Don't connect
992000	994000	Makes sense
994000	996000	Awesome
996000	998000	Please chime in throughout the night
998000	1000000	Tell us what you think about the news
1000000	1002000	And we're just really happy to have you here

1010000	1012000	Twitch.tv slash VG Realness
1012000	1014000	We do have a YouTube channel as well
1014000	1016000	Which has like some of our old playthroughs
1016000	1018000	Because sometimes we would play games
1018000	1020000	Together as all four of us
1020000	1022000	Or together
1022000	1024000	Sometimes me and James would be playing
1024000	1026000	Final Fantasy 14 so all of our old
1026000	1028000	Video clips and stuff are on our YouTube
1028000	1030000	Channel as well which you can just search
1030000	1032000	Video game realness and it's on there
1032000	1034000	They are
1034000	1036000	I like to think so
1036000	1038000	I'm curious though
1038000	1040000	Am I the first guest you've had
1040000	1042000	From Canada?
1042000	1044000	In studio
1044000	1046000	Yes
1046000	1048000	I'm pretty sure we've had a Skype guest
1048000	1050000	From Canada
1050000	1052000	But in studio
1052000	1054000	I think we had guys from Vancouver
1054000	1056000	But as far as in studio
1056000	1058000	Yes
1058000	1060000	I'm pretty confident in saying yeah you're the first one from Canada
1060000	1062000	If I'm wrong
1062000	1064000	Dark Tetsuya will correct me shortly
1064000	1066000	Because he knows this show better than I do
1066000	1068000	Which is fine
1068000	1070000	That's why we have a wiki
1070000	1072000	Alright I appreciate that
1072000	1074000	What is the number one thing
1074000	1076000	People in the US should know about Canada
1076000	1080000	We don't all say A in a boot
1080000	1082000	You kind of did though a little bit
1082000	1084000	You definitely said A
1084000	1086000	Ok not all of us though
1086000	1088000	Maybe I did
1088000	1090000	But not all of us
1090000	1092000	You know what though good point
1092000	1094000	Now that I'm thinking about this
1094000	1096000	I have interviewed people at conventions randomly
1096000	1098000	And some of them may have been from Canada
1098000	1100000	But actually sitting in on the show
1100000	1102000	You've got to be the first
1102000	1104000	So SJ100Matt says Canada is great
1104000	1106000	I'm going up to Toronto later this month
1106000	1108000	And says poutine is the one thing we should know
1108000	1110000	I'm actually very thankful
1110000	1112000	That you actually brought with you
1112000	1114000	Ketchup chips
1114000	1116000	Oh yeah that's right
1116000	1118000	No no no
1118000	1120000	Why not they make sense
1120000	1122000	You put ketchup on french fries and hash browns
1122000	1124000	And other potatoes why not put them on chips
1124000	1126000	I get it
1126000	1128000	But you know what's funny
1128000	1130000	I was explaining this to you last night
1130000	1132000	We just had this hilarious
1132000	1134000	All these stupid differences between the countries
1134000	1136000	But right now for some reason
1136000	1138000	They're selling all dressed chips
1138000	1140000	Which we don't usually have in the US
1140000	1142000	But Ruffles or whatever is doing this
1142000	1144000	Random ass promotion
1144000	1146000	I should have also brought you Smarties
1146000	1148000	The chocolate candy
1148000	1150000	Not the little tart things
1150000	1152000	That we associate with
1152000	1154000	So we have Smarties as something different
1154000	1156000	Completely in Canada
1156000	1158000	And then I think the things
1158000	1160000	That you call Smarties we call pop rockets
1160000	1162000	Or something I can't quite recall
1162000	1164000	Because I'm not that candy person
1164000	1166000	Alright good to know
1166000	1168000	D'artizia in chat is confirming
1168000	1170000	I'm pretty sure he's the first Canadian we know
1170000	1172000	That's actually on the show
1172000	1174000	The ambassador to Canada
1174000	1176000	Delvin is here with us tonight
1176000	1178000	Yes queen
1178000	1180000	Alright let's get into our kickoff topic tonight
1180000	1182000	Which has to do with movies movies movies
1182000	1184000	Like this week it just seems like
1184000	1186000	All these video games suddenly
1186000	1188000	Want to turn into movies
1188000	1190000	Loki you want to tell us a little more about
1190000	1192000	What's going on this week with Hollywood's recent
1192000	1194000	Obsession with adapting more video games
1194000	1196000	When, correct me if I'm wrong
1196000	1198000	Video game adaptations
1198000	1200000	Like some have done okay
1200000	1202000	You know like Resident Evil
1202000	1204000	They've made how many of those movies
1204000	1206000	Because I think they do very well on Blu Ray
1206000	1208000	And home video and you know cult type of things
1208000	1210000	You know with the horror crowd
1210000	1212000	I know there's definitely a huge fandom of Resident Evil
1212000	1214000	And so forth so I think those movies have done
1214000	1216000	Okay but like I'm not thinking of like
1216000	1218000	You know how like when there's a big
1218000	1220000	Big movie like let's say Titanic
1220000	1222000	Right then suddenly Hollywood is like
1222000	1224000	What are all the other disasters in
1224000	1226000	History we need to suddenly make
1226000	1228000	A movie or or um
1228000	1230000	Titanic did well well then we need to remake
1230000	1232000	The Poseidon adventure right away
1232000	1234000	Right like Hollywood has this
1234000	1236000	Obsession with if one thing is big
1236000	1238000	So I'm trying to like
1238000	1240000	They have this obsession with we run out of ideas
1240000	1242000	And so now let's
1242000	1244000	Yeah we gotta remake everything
1244000	1246000	Scrape that barrel until there's no barrel left
1246000	1248000	Although I'm gonna get this off my chest
1248000	1250000	Right now because while many of you were
1250000	1252000	Seeing Venom in the theaters this weekend
1252000	1254000	My ass was there opening night to see
1254000	1256000	A Star is Born with Lady Gaga
1256000	1258000	The fourth remake of that movie
1258000	1260000	And all I'm gonna say is
1260000	1262000	Yes queen
1262000	1264000	Well all I'm saying is yes I am
1264000	1266000	Seeing Venom next week
1266000	1268000	No I don't really care to see it but it's a
1268000	1270000	Free movie my dad wants to hang out so
1270000	1272000	Sure
1272000	1274000	There's nothing else playing he's like
1274000	1276000	So you don't wanna go see A Star is Born like no
1276000	1278000	It's so good
1278000	1280000	I cried so much
1280000	1282000	She's queening out
1282000	1284000	Anyway no but my point is
1284000	1286000	Not every remake
1286000	1288000	But the thing about
1288000	1290000	Not to get too far this is a video game show but the thing about
1290000	1292000	Star is Born is that
1292000	1294000	The one in the 50's is about
1294000	1296000	Hollywood acting this one is very much about
1296000	1298000	Music making because obviously that's what Gaga
1298000	1300000	Does so it's like Grammys
1300000	1302000	But anyway
1302000	1304000	I can save that for another podcast
1304000	1306000	Let's talk about my point with this whole thing
1306000	1308000	Was why is Hollywood suddenly obsessed
1308000	1310000	With we've gotta make a video game
1310000	1312000	Movie because we have so many of them just coming out
1312000	1314000	I think because they're doing like well this
1314000	1316000	Is kind of Konami a little bit you know they're
1316000	1318000	Doing I think they have had some
1318000	1320000	Success with Castlevania as a series
1320000	1322000	And so now they're like yeah sure
1322000	1324000	You can make our properties into
1324000	1326000	Things so like first off we've got Dance Dance
1326000	1328000	Revolution being adapted
1328000	1330000	To something
1330000	1332000	What is there to adapt? Look
1332000	1334000	Well here's what they're saying and this
1334000	1336000	This is gonna be like
1336000	1338000	Real quick real quick cause I wanna address the
1338000	1340000	First question before we move on about like what is
1340000	1342000	Hollywood's obsession right now with this
1342000	1344000	Tigerclaw says movies based on video games are
1344000	1346000	Usually a hit or miss it depends on the source
1346000	1348000	Material some video game movies are better than
1348000	1350000	Others because they're closer to the source material
1350000	1352000	Than others Tomb Raider for example
1352000	1354000	That was a good video game movie I forgot
1354000	1356000	That was pretty recent but I didn't think that
1356000	1358000	One made I mean I didn't see the movie
1358000	1360000	I heard it was actually like decent
1360000	1362000	It was like it didn't it didn't like
1362000	1364000	Make a tragedy of the game or anything like it was
1364000	1366000	A good adaptation but I don't think it made
1366000	1368000	Shit tons of money
1368000	1370000	Like I don't even know if it made its budget back
1370000	1372000	But anyway like that's
1372000	1374000	Like a kind of a recent thing that
1374000	1376000	Came up so anyway sorry so
1376000	1378000	DDR where are we going with this
1378000	1380000	No we're good
1380000	1382000	Unfortunately so basically
1382000	1384000	Here is how
1384000	1386000	They summarize it
1386000	1388000	The project will explore a world
1388000	1390000	On the brink of destruction where only
1390000	1392000	The only hope is to unite
1392000	1394000	Through the universal language
1394000	1396000	Of dance
1396000	1398000	Fucking stupid
1398000	1400000	Um and since I know
1400000	1402000	A lot of people playing the home game are probably
1402000	1404000	Shouting various other movies that
1404000	1406000	Have been about DDR in the past
1406000	1408000	We have things like DDR the movie so we have
1408000	1410000	The FP La Machina
1410000	1412000	De Bailar a failed
1412000	1414000	DDR movie script floating around for the 2000s
1414000	1416000	That's what Rama says in chat at live.vognetwork.com
1416000	1418000	Um so this isn't necessarily
1418000	1420000	The first movie about DDR
1420000	1422000	But I mean here's the thing like
1422000	1424000	I I'm gonna say something y'all might
1424000	1426000	Not like but those movies even though
1426000	1428000	They're DDR inspired they're not
1428000	1430000	Dance Dance Revolution the movie
1430000	1432000	They're more about you know
1432000	1434000	Community DDR is kind of a plot device
1434000	1436000	So to speak
1436000	1438000	And I'm fine with it being a plot device
1438000	1440000	And honestly this sounds more like something
1440000	1442000	That would you know lend itself better to like
1442000	1444000	An animation or something like some
1444000	1446000	Some kid wants a
1446000	1448000	You know make it to like the
1448000	1450000	Grand chan- who cares make the stakes
1450000	1452000	Lower and just like you know
1452000	1454000	Talk about like the community
1454000	1456000	Or something but like instead they're going with
1456000	1458000	Fucking apocalypse it's always a
1458000	1460000	Fucking apocalypse of some sort and
1460000	1462000	This doesn't it doesn't lend
1462000	1464000	Itself you can't have like
1464000	1466000	Hey guys you know what
1466000	1468000	The step up series is doing fucking great
1468000	1470000	Let's make a movie where we
1470000	1472000	Save the world from an apocalypse with
1472000	1474000	It's fucking stupid it sounds
1474000	1476000	Stupid with an established franchise like that
1476000	1478000	And now we're gonna do something different
1478000	1480000	The only way
1480000	1482000	That Emmy could save the world
1482000	1484000	Was to get a triple A on
1484000	1486000	Brilliant to You
1486000	1488000	This is what I'm gonna
1488000	1490000	Say there's no fucking story in
1490000	1492000	DDR so I don't understand like why they're
1492000	1494000	Gonna do movies so in my opinion
1494000	1496000	And that's my opinion is that
1496000	1498000	If they're gonna do a DDR movie
1498000	1500000	It needs to have two things
1500000	1502000	It needs to have some scene where
1502000	1504000	Arrows go up the screen if arrows do not
1504000	1506000	Go up the screen at some point in the movie
1506000	1508000	Fail. Number two that
1508000	1510000	Soundtrack better be the
1510000	1512000	Cheesiest fucking 90s euro dance
1512000	1514000	I have heard in my entire
1514000	1516000	Life because if skill
1516000	1518000	Rex is on that album throw it in
1518000	1520000	The garbage
1520000	1522000	My guess is that with
1522000	1524000	The uniting of the world
1524000	1526000	With dance is that it's gonna
1526000	1528000	Incorporate different types
1528000	1530000	Of music and dance and then the arrows
1530000	1532000	Will be the language in which they speak
1532000	1534000	So there will be arrows
1534000	1536000	On the screen but they'll
1536000	1538000	That will be their way of communicating
1538000	1540000	Will the arrows make a heart at some point?
1540000	1542000	Yes and a giant heart
1542000	1544000	And then it will save the world
1544000	1546000	Sailor Moon style
1546000	1548000	Like the only way that this is like
1548000	1550000	Sounds any like a plausible
1550000	1552000	Thing like to use like music to
1552000	1554000	Save the world type thing it sounds like
1554000	1556000	Matt Cross 7
1556000	1558000	Or 2 or I don't remember which
1558000	1560000	Matt Cross series they had where I think it was
1560000	1562000	7 where they had like the rock band and
1562000	1564000	They were fighting actually with music and stuff
1564000	1566000	Matt Cross 2 I didn't watch any of those I just
1566000	1568000	Remember the figures for them
1568000	1570000	So that's the only way I could
1570000	1572000	See that something like that if you want to fight
1572000	1574000	With like music or something but other than that I just don't
1574000	1576000	See how this could be a thing
1576000	1578000	It's gonna be garbage
1578000	1580000	It's a movie called Dance Dance Revolution
1580000	1582000	That might have like
1582000	1584000	One throw it like do you remember
1584000	1586000	When they made a battleship movie?
1586000	1588000	With Rihanna in it
1588000	1590000	I've talked about this on a show before
1590000	1592000	I know I have it was fucking terrible yeah
1592000	1594000	That's the thing I said if that movie
1594000	1596000	Did not have a scene with Liam Neeson
1596000	1598000	Going you suck my battleship
1598000	1600000	Then it's not a battleship game
1600000	1602000	And they have the pegs they have the pegs in there too
1602000	1604000	And that was great I saw it in the trailer
1604000	1606000	I'm like this is stupid but that's the thing
1606000	1608000	You know it's stupid and that's what you
1608000	1610000	Go to see is stupid and guess what they're
1610000	1612000	Delivering stupid so
1612000	1614000	I will say
1614000	1616000	Dance is kind of big right now like
1616000	1618000	That World of Dance show on NBC
1618000	1620000	Have you like seen some of that like
1620000	1622000	Like I gotta say like some of the
1622000	1624000	Like cause you know I love
1624000	1626000	Emotional porn on Facebook right
1626000	1628000	Like I will watch those auditions
1628000	1630000	With like the little girl that like
1630000	1632000	Breaks this on and then all the judges start crying
1632000	1634000	And then I'm crying and we're all crying
1634000	1636000	And it's like 1 am and I'm not in bed yet
1636000	1638000	It's not gonna be that
1638000	1640000	But I'm saying dance is big right now cause that World of Dance show
1640000	1642000	Is actually has a lot of that
1642000	1644000	And then what just tonight
1644000	1646000	They've got Dancing with the Stars with
1646000	1648000	Little kids for some reason
1648000	1650000	I don't know with Honey Boo Boo
1650000	1652000	Dancing with the Stars is tonight
1652000	1654000	Oh wait is she actually on it?
1654000	1656000	Yeah Honey Boo Boo is on it
1656000	1658000	She must be much older now
1658000	1660000	Like what is she grown up all the way
1660000	1662000	Yeah but you know gotta get those paychecks
1662000	1664000	Still rolling in like you know
1664000	1666000	That show went off the air how many years ago
1666000	1668000	So gotta pay for college
1668000	1670000	That kid will go to any college she wants
1670000	1672000	So anyway
1672000	1674000	Dance is big right now so why not
1674000	1676000	I just don't have high expectations
1676000	1678000	Whatever the hell they put in the theater so I don't really care
1678000	1680000	Sorry I gotta say Bobby Blackwoven
1680000	1682000	Chat after I talked about Honey Boo Boo
1682000	1684000	Bobby Blackwoven chats like
1684000	1686000	Delvin's like well OLR was fun but you
1686000	1688000	Got a TV right
1688000	1690000	I love it
1690000	1692000	I love it alright so enough
1692000	1694000	Enough Dance Dance Revolution so
1694000	1696000	That may be a thing we'll see
1696000	1698000	I think if it's gonna suck this
1698000	1700000	Especially since what? It's like
1700000	1702000	It's not necessarily like
1702000	1704000	This would have been like something to do
1704000	1706000	A decade or so ago
1706000	1708000	Like when it was like super popular
1708000	1710000	Now it's not super popular
1710000	1712000	You've missed your boat
1712000	1714000	Here's the thing and I want you all to know
1714000	1716000	I love dance you might think I'm excited
1716000	1718000	About a DDR movie I'm not
1718000	1720000	I love Dance Dance Revolution
1720000	1722000	This show wouldn't exist if it wasn't for
1722000	1724000	DDR in the community but when I heard
1724000	1726000	The movie the news about the movie and this
1726000	1728000	Whole plot and everything I'm that lady
1728000	1730000	In the matrix and you've all seen this
1730000	1732000	Youtuber gif I don't remember her name
1732000	1734000	But you see her and she's looking and she knows
1734000	1736000	About to get unplugged she's gonna die she's going
1736000	1738000	Not like this not like this
1738000	1740000	And that's how I'm looking
1740000	1742000	At this DDR movie not like
1742000	1744000	This is not where I would not like this
1744000	1746000	Anyway
1746000	1748000	What else is gonna get ruined?
1748000	1750000	Well let's see the next
1750000	1752000	Step on the list is
1752000	1754000	Monster Hunter the movie
1754000	1756000	Alright Monster Hunter that's a popular
1756000	1758000	Series let's see how we're
1758000	1760000	Gonna fuck this one up
1761000	1763000	Well the movie plot centers
1763000	1765000	On the leader of a UN military
1765000	1767000	Team named Artemis played
1767000	1769000	Oh but it's got Milaj
1769000	1771000	Um Jovanovich so
1771000	1773000	Milajovic Jovanovich yeah whatever
1773000	1775000	You know why she's in it
1775000	1777000	Because it's just gonna be garbage
1777000	1779000	Better than that who's directing it
1779000	1781000	Oh her husband
1781000	1783000	Yeah so
1783000	1785000	Whatever you know what it's fine I can see
1785000	1787000	This being like a schlocky
1787000	1789000	It's a great Hollywood love story
1789000	1791000	If we're gonna flop we're gonna flop together
1791000	1793000	So it's alright
1793000	1795000	It's transported into another realm populated by
1795000	1797000	Monsters where she meets a hunter
1797000	1799000	Jai
1799000	1801000	With two team
1801000	1803000	Or two of them teaming up to close the portal
1803000	1805000	To prevent monsters from attacking Earth
1805000	1807000	Doesn't sound like Monster Hunter
1807000	1809000	But you know what though
1809000	1811000	Yeah Darkest Season chat says are we sure this is a Monster Hunter movie
1811000	1813000	It's what it is
1813000	1815000	It does have the video game director
1815000	1817000	Doing it and it's got the name
1817000	1819000	So
1819000	1821000	I mean there's monsters in it and there might be
1821000	1823000	Four people trying to take down the monster
1823000	1825000	Honestly though but here's why
1825000	1827000	Like think about it this is why that they're gonna
1827000	1829000	Let them do this
1829000	1831000	Look at how much money Capcom probably made
1831000	1833000	From the Resident Evil movie franchise
1833000	1835000	And let's be honest the Resident Evil movies
1835000	1837000	They're not high caliber
1837000	1839000	They were just
1839000	1841000	They're entertaining popcorn films
1841000	1843000	That's what I see this as
1843000	1845000	That's what I see this as
1845000	1847000	Instead of it being zombies
1847000	1849000	It's just gonna be fucking monsters now
1849000	1851000	And it's the same shit
1851000	1853000	Because she's a
1853000	1855000	UN military person so it's basically
1855000	1857000	Her fucking character from
1857000	1859000	The Resident Evil movies
1859000	1861000	Just thrown into a whole other fucking universe
1861000	1863000	With CGI monsters that says
1863000	1865000	CGI zombies
1865000	1867000	I will say out of the movies
1867000	1869000	The games becoming movies Monster Hunter is the one that
1869000	1871000	Kinda makes the most sense
1871000	1873000	Honestly like if you're gonna make
1873000	1875000	It become a movie like Monster Hunter I'm like
1875000	1877000	Okay well that's not like DDR
1877000	1879000	You know that has at least a plot
1879000	1881000	Or like some sort of a story
1881000	1883000	Monsters being hunted okay
1883000	1885000	I'm with you
1885000	1887000	It's basic but I got it
1887000	1889000	Godzilla was a monster being hunted
1889000	1891000	Oh good point good point
1891000	1893000	Well Hollywood loves a monster movie
1893000	1895000	And of course since
1895000	1897000	Capcom's sense is hmm there's
1897000	1899000	Money to be made from our franchises
1899000	1901000	We tried Street Fighter that didn't work
1901000	1903000	Out so well a few times
1903000	1905000	We are trying uh we tried
1905000	1907000	Resident Evil that worked out let's go with that
1907000	1909000	Monster Hunter? Possibly
1909000	1911000	How about we fuck over Mega Man
1911000	1913000	Again he's not quite dead
1913000	1915000	Yet with the animated series
1915000	1917000	No because I'm counting the animated series
1917000	1919000	With that have you watched the animated series?
1919000	1921000	Absolutely not it's pretty garbage
1921000	1923000	It's not that bad
1923000	1925000	Our Resident Mega Man fan says
1925000	1927000	It's not that bad
1927000	1929000	But it's not that good either
1929000	1931000	That saw that there's a tiny Mega Man
1931000	1933000	That's living inside of Mega Man's head
1933000	1935000	Yes I'm sorry that's it's terrible
1935000	1937000	It's fucking garbage
1937000	1939000	It's fucking garbage and like
1939000	1941000	They should do it in a way they're gonna do
1941000	1943000	An animated series of Mega Man and they wanna
1943000	1945000	Be silly like that then do it like the
1945000	1947000	Fucking Teen Titans series
1947000	1949000	I mean Teen Titans Go just do it like that
1949000	1951000	Where it's self
1951000	1953000	Referential and just silly
1953000	1955000	Oh wait were you talking about the new Mega Man
1955000	1957000	The new one okay sorry no
1957000	1959000	I was referring to the old one
1959000	1961000	Oh no no the old one
1961000	1963000	That's fine that was a long time ago we made
1963000	1965000	Our mistakes back then
1965000	1967000	Yeah I was referring to the old one
1967000	1969000	No I'm talking about the new Mega Man
1969000	1971000	No no no no
1971000	1973000	No new Mega Man series yeah
1973000	1975000	So they're thinking
1975000	1977000	About doing and not necessarily
1977000	1979000	An animated Mega Man series
1979000	1981000	A live action Mega Man
1981000	1983000	Film
1983000	1985000	That makes me very nervous
1985000	1987000	Based on the influential and globally
1987000	1989000	Beloved Mega Man franchise
1989000	1991000	Capcom aims to appeal
1991000	1993000	To a diverse audience
1993000	1995000	Including not only game players
1995000	1997000	But action movie fans
1997000	1999000	As well you know this
1999000	2001000	Is how we get this right here
2001000	2003000	Is how we get that prototype of Mega Man
2003000	2005000	That fucking was scrapped and you know the one that looked like
2005000	2007000	Bomberman Act Zero that bullshit
2007000	2009000	Oh yeah that's how we get this shit
2009000	2011000	Yeah I was still
2011000	2013000	Watch it though
2013000	2015000	Every day I hear about the Sonic the Hedgehog movie
2015000	2017000	I'm just like going
2017000	2019000	I will watch that because Jim Carrey's in it
2019000	2021000	And that's the only reason why
2021000	2023000	Is going to be a mess
2023000	2025000	Is going to be a mess
2025000	2027000	I'm a little worried when they say live action
2027000	2029000	Because immediately I get the picture
2029000	2031000	The cover art of Mega Man 2
2031000	2033000	In my head
2033000	2035000	With the human Mega Man
2035000	2037000	And that just terrifies me to see that
2037000	2039000	But what if that human Mega Man is played by none other than
2039000	2041000	Nathan Fillion
2041000	2043000	Who's going to play Mega Man?
2043000	2045000	Oh I imagine if Mega Man is a boy
2045000	2047000	They're going to get a child actor to play Mega Man
2047000	2049000	And they'll probably humanize
2049000	2051000	Like I don't think Mega Man will look so
2051000	2053000	Roboty but Mega Man will look like
2053000	2055000	A little kid but maybe with like
2055000	2057000	An arm that shoots lasers
2057000	2059000	We'll get none other than child actor
2059000	2061000	Macaulay Culkin
2061000	2063000	He's in his 30s I mean like
2063000	2065000	He was a child actor at one time
2065000	2067000	That's still
2067000	2069000	That's like the whole thing where I'm like wait a minute
2069000	2071000	I'm still voicing Sora
2071000	2073000	Okay that's going to be interesting
2073000	2075000	Because Sora's going to be very much an adult now
2075000	2077000	Because Haley Joel Osment's
2077000	2079000	I don't know if y'all know
2079000	2081000	But since Kingdom Hearts
2081000	2083000	The last game was like 15 years ago
2083000	2085000	Haley Joel Osment is not a kid anymore
2085000	2087000	I don't know if y'all know
2087000	2089000	He a very grown man now
2089000	2091000	I don't know if y'all have heard
2091000	2093000	But a lot of those kid actors have grown up
2093000	2095000	Like that kid who played Anakin
2095000	2097000	In the first Star Wars movie
2097000	2099000	And he also was like you know what
2099000	2101000	Acting is not for me because people are fucking me
2101000	2103000	Because you know people were really fucking rude to him
2103000	2105000	Because they blamed
2105000	2107000	The failures of episode one on
2107000	2109000	What a seven year old boy
2109000	2111000	Because that's a rational thing to do
2111000	2113000	Anyway
2113000	2115000	Who knows it's George Lucas come on
2115000	2117000	Let's see
2117000	2119000	Looking in chat over at
2119000	2121000	Live.vog at Network.com
2121000	2123000	Dungeon Buster says I've seen artists try to make Mega Man
2123000	2125000	Look realistic
2125000	2127000	One box art did not turn out well
2127000	2129000	The only positive
2129000	2131000	I think there's a way to make Mega Man not look
2131000	2133000	He just won't look like the robot
2133000	2135000	Except maybe in like one scene
2135000	2137000	The only positive I have here
2137000	2139000	Because I'm a fan of his as well
2139000	2141000	Is that it's being produced
2141000	2143000	I guess
2143000	2145000	Along with Masaoka
2145000	2147000	Which was the guy from Heroes
2147000	2149000	That was the guy in Heroes
2149000	2151000	He's like kind of helping shape this
2151000	2153000	Okay you have my attention
2153000	2155000	He's kind of a geeky guy that I feel
2155000	2157000	Has probably actually played Mega Man
2157000	2159000	I played Mega Man
2159000	2161000	So I'm hopeful
2161000	2163000	Okay
2163000	2165000	Once again though
2165000	2167000	We'll put that in column A
2167000	2169000	I will see it no matter how garbage it is
2169000	2171000	Just so I can complain about it
2171000	2173000	I think it has potential
2173000	2175000	To be really good if they
2175000	2177000	Went the X series route
2177000	2179000	As opposed to the original Mega Man
2179000	2181000	But it would be weird for them to jump
2181000	2183000	To the X series
2183000	2185000	And not start at the beginning for people who've never
2185000	2187000	Played Mega Man before
2187000	2189000	So it's
2189000	2191000	Either here or there
2191000	2193000	I think it would actually be
2193000	2195000	Like you guys are going to disagree with me
2195000	2197000	But I think it would be very smart of them
2197000	2199000	Like if they want to make a good movie
2199000	2201000	They're going to really keep the references to the games
2201000	2203000	Very light
2203000	2205000	Like there will be a Mega Man
2205000	2207000	There will be a Dr. Light
2207000	2209000	And a Dr. Wily
2209000	2211000	But maybe it's not like
2211000	2213000	You just described the game
2213000	2215000	I know but like it's not like
2215000	2217000	Levels
2217000	2219000	It's just going to be like
2219000	2221000	Maybe it's like Scott Pilgrim
2221000	2223000	I would be fine with Scott Pilgrim
2223000	2225000	Type of movie
2225000	2227000	He's got to find these other kids that are actually
2227000	2229000	The creations of Dr. Wily
2229000	2231000	Yeah exactly
2231000	2233000	Now that I'd be okay with
2233000	2235000	Going to chat at
2235000	2237000	Live.vognetwork.com
2237000	2239000	And SS200Matt says at the end they will say
2239000	2241000	He is a Mega Man
2243000	2245000	Cause you know we all
2245000	2247000	Y'all love it when somebody in the movie
2247000	2249000	Says the title of the movie
2249000	2251000	Roll credits
2251000	2253000	Yeah got it
2253000	2255000	There you go
2255000	2257000	Three video game movies
2257000	2259000	Coming soon
2259000	2261000	Maybe not that soon
2261000	2263000	Eventually
2263000	2265000	Let's move on into some
2265000	2267000	How was your gaming week and the types of video games
2267000	2269000	That you've been playing this week
2269000	2271000	Loki we'll start with you
2271000	2273000	I played Forza Horizon 4
2273000	2275000	So I played through a little bit of that
2275000	2277000	I
2277000	2279000	Don't know what I'm
2279000	2281000	I'm probably training my
2281000	2283000	Dryvatars badly
2283000	2285000	Because I'm not on the roads most of the time
2285000	2287000	I'm just going everywhere else
2287000	2289000	But
2289000	2291000	Yeah it's a very pretty game
2291000	2293000	It runs really nice on my laptop
2293000	2295000	So I'm happy about that
2295000	2297000	Um
2297000	2299000	Then I did play a little bit of
2299000	2301000	DDR
2301000	2303000	Ace
2303000	2305000	I went to the arcades actually
2305000	2307000	I've been meaning to go over there and play for like a long time
2307000	2309000	But the problem is it's like so packed over there
2309000	2311000	Dave and Busters
2311000	2313000	That can never really get on the machine
2313000	2315000	Especially since there's fuckers that like to
2315000	2317000	Camp on the machine all day long
2317000	2319000	It's like don't you have school or something?
2319000	2321000	I mean like shouldn't you be
2321000	2323000	In a job? I don't know
2323000	2325000	But so I did that
2325000	2327000	And then you know other arcade games with the Golf Land
2327000	2329000	Because I had to keep my son
2329000	2331000	Away from my other son
2331000	2333000	Because my other son was sick
2333000	2335000	And so that means I had to take him out of the house the entire day
2335000	2337000	So that was pretty much
2337000	2339000	Saturday all arcade day
2339000	2341000	So we were playing different arcade games
2341000	2343000	I got to play the giant
2343000	2345000	Space Invaders game
2345000	2347000	Which meh
2347000	2349000	Mario Kart was pretty fun
2349000	2351000	Played a little bit of that
2351000	2353000	And very sad
2353000	2355000	That I saw the
2355000	2357000	DDR Max 2 machine
2357000	2359000	That's at
2359000	2361000	Roosevelt Golf Land
2361000	2363000	And it is a sad, it's off
2363000	2365000	And it's a very sad sight
2365000	2367000	I didn't take Delvin to Golf Land while he's here
2367000	2369000	For a reason, I was just like you know it's skippable
2369000	2371000	It's um
2371000	2373000	The golf course is nice
2373000	2375000	We went and played mini golf, they have it all decorated for Halloween
2375000	2377000	So that's kind of cool
2377000	2379000	The only way to fixing their machines up is
2379000	2381000	They don't give a shit
2381000	2383000	As long as the ticket spitters are working
2383000	2385000	Then they don't give a shit about anything else
2385000	2387000	But it was a sad sight
2387000	2389000	Do you have mini golf in Canada?
2389000	2391000	We do
2391000	2393000	Well then yeah, there's no point
2393000	2395000	And then what else?
2395000	2397000	So
2397000	2399000	Pokemon Go
2399000	2401000	And
2401000	2403000	Just
2403000	2405000	Yeah, that's pretty much it
2405000	2407000	I didn't get the chance to play Super Mario Party
2407000	2409000	Because my kids basically have been
2409000	2411000	You know, monopolizing the Switch
2411000	2413000	And
2413000	2415000	I didn't bother to purchase Spiderman
2415000	2417000	Because my wife's monopolizing the TV
2417000	2419000	To watch a stupid baking show that she could watch
2419000	2421000	Oh, the Great British Bake Off?
2421000	2423000	Oh good times, love that show
2423000	2425000	It's a great show, but I wish I could have the TV once in a while
2425000	2427000	Has she watched Nailed It?
2427000	2429000	Because that's another great one
2429000	2431000	You know what, I set up a TV in our bedroom
2431000	2433000	She's like, I want to watch Netflix in bed
2433000	2435000	Okay, cool, set up the old TV in the bedroom
2435000	2437000	With the Netflix box
2437000	2439000	Watch your fucking baking show in here
2439000	2441000	Then I can play on the 4K TV
2441000	2443000	That we bought with my nice 4K system
2443000	2445000	To play some 4K games
2445000	2447000	Nope!
2447000	2449000	Gotta fucking watch the goddamn baking show in 4K instead
2449000	2451000	It's like, ugh
2451000	2453000	We need to see every detail on those cakes
2453000	2455000	And they are fucking delicious looking
2455000	2457000	No fault of that show
2457000	2459000	It's just, it's
2459000	2461000	It's everything
2461000	2463000	Uh, Delvin, I'll let you go next
2463000	2465000	Because I know we have a little bit of overlap
2465000	2467000	So I'll let you, you know, I can always just talk about 4
2467000	2469000	How was your gaming week, Delvin?
2469000	2471000	Um, so
2471000	2473000	For the past week and a bit
2473000	2475000	Uh, I just recently got back
2475000	2477000	Into playing World of Warcraft
2477000	2479000	I'm back on my bullshit again
2479000	2481000	Of playing World of Warcraft
2481000	2483000	Uh, so
2483000	2485000	Any fans listening from
2485000	2487000	Video gaming will just know that I
2487000	2489000	Swore that I was not going to play
2489000	2491000	Uh
2491000	2493000	I'm right there with you
2493000	2495000	I swore, I'm like, nope, not going to play this expansion
2495000	2497000	I'm done, I'm not playing World of Warcraft anymore
2497000	2499000	And then
2499000	2501000	I blame Cameron
2501000	2503000	Because he started playing
2503000	2505000	And we're basically, we enable each other
2505000	2507000	One of us will start playing
2507000	2509000	And then enable the other person
2509000	2511000	To start playing
2511000	2513000	It's kind of like the friendship Shane and I have
2513000	2515000	And so
2515000	2517000	Not totally his fault, but then another friend
2517000	2519000	Was playing too, and I was like, okay, well, fuck
2519000	2521000	The band's getting back together again
2521000	2523000	So I don't want to be the one left out
2523000	2525000	Uh, so I got back
2525000	2527000	Playing about a week and a half ago
2527000	2529000	And power leveled all the way
2529000	2531000	To 120, and then started
2531000	2533000	Grinding through dungeons, mythic bluses
2533000	2535000	Raiding, and
2535000	2537000	I'm such a
2537000	2539000	Nerd that, you know, the raid
2539000	2541000	Resets are on the Tuesday
2541000	2543000	Right. So
2543000	2545000	Tuesday night, uh
2545000	2547000	I did all my raiding for one week
2547000	2549000	Because I was leaving
2549000	2551000	Yeah. Wednesday
2551000	2553000	So Tuesday I did
2553000	2555000	All of normal raid
2555000	2557000	And I did a bit of heroic with
2557000	2559000	My guild
2559000	2561000	And did some, like I did everything that I needed to do
2561000	2563000	For the week, I did the mythic plus, so I would get something
2563000	2565000	In my box for the week
2565000	2567000	And all of it
2567000	2569000	And so that was my gaming week mostly
2569000	2571000	Um, I also, like I did mention
2571000	2573000	Bonds006 says you did not want to be the diva
2573000	2575000	Holding out to get the band
2575000	2577000	Get together. Exactly. You did not want to be
2577000	2579000	Posh Spice. No. You did not want to be the hold out
2579000	2581000	Exactly. So I was like
2581000	2583000	Whatever. I've been playing for
2583000	2585000	Ten years, what's, what's another
2585000	2587000	Year? Right? So who cares?
2587000	2589000	Um, and uh
2589000	2591000	I did play some Mega Man
2591000	2593000	Um, and that, and of course Pokemon Go
2593000	2595000	A lot, uh, we've been playing over
2595000	2597000	The weekend. Yeah, we were hanging with Dark
2597000	2599000	Sakura yesterday actually, since obviously
2599000	2601000	She's not available on Sundays, so we kind of spent yesterday
2601000	2603000	With her so you could meet her. Um, and then we
2603000	2605000	Ended up, she did not have Mewtwo yet
2605000	2607000	And it was like, me, you, her
2607000	2609000	And Allen like all play, so I was like
2609000	2611000	Okay, we have four people together, where's the Mewtwo
2611000	2613000	At? And we're like, maybe somebody will be
2613000	2615000	There if we get there right at Hatch, and sure enough
2615000	2617000	We, and there was this couple, walked
2617000	2619000	Right up when we did, and it was like, oh good
2619000	2621000	We were hoping other people would be here, so like between the six
2621000	2623000	Of us, actually no, there was a seventh account
2623000	2625000	A mysterious seventh
2625000	2627000	Player. Possible Spoofer
2627000	2629000	But thank you Spoofer
2629000	2631000	Yeah, cause we took that one down, and then we did the other one
2631000	2633000	At the bridge. Yes. Which, like
2633000	2635000	The same thing happened. We're like, where are they?
2635000	2637000	And I looked over and I'm like, that dude's on his phone over there
2637000	2639000	Yeah. That's the other guy
2639000	2641000	So I, it's, so, it's funny
2641000	2643000	We're talking about the Mewtwo
2643000	2645000	I have done, probably about
2645000	2647000	Eight Mewtwo raids
2647000	2649000	Uh, between here and back in Toronto
2649000	2651000	And, not for the life of me could I catch
2651000	2653000	More than one god damn Mewtwo
2653000	2655000	So I did catch one here, and
2655000	2657000	So now I have two, but that's it
2657000	2659000	Yeah. And it's hard now to get
2659000	2661000	To find Mewtwo raids back
2661000	2663000	In Toronto because it seems like
2663000	2665000	Once the initial rush of
2665000	2667000	Mewtwo coming out was done
2667000	2669000	Nobody's doing raids anymore
2669000	2671000	I find that people still want to do them
2671000	2673000	I mean, it might be harder, especially in like
2673000	2675000	Less trafficked areas to find the people
2675000	2677000	But people still generally want to do them
2677000	2679000	Because they're really good experience
2679000	2681000	And it's the only way you can get rare candy and items
2681000	2683000	So you might as well use your free pass
2683000	2685000	For the day if you can get a group
2685000	2687000	You might as well do it, there's no harm in doing it
2687000	2689000	I did, I did join, uh
2689000	2691000	There's a discord group, uh, for the Toronto
2691000	2693000	Area for Pokemon Go
2693000	2695000	So, I'm gonna utilize that a bit more
2695000	2697000	Now that we're starting to get into the colder
2697000	2699000	Months in Toronto
2699000	2701000	It's a lot harder to get people to do raids
2701000	2703000	Unless you actually coordinate
2703000	2705000	Well plus, load up on Trashymon here
2705000	2707000	In California, and then when you go back
2707000	2709000	You could just be like, does anyone want to do distance trading
2709000	2711000	Cause it's, it's like 3000 kilometers
2711000	2713000	Cause like, when I open my Alolan
2713000	2715000	Eggs, I'm very particular
2715000	2717000	I will tend to, so like
2717000	2719000	This is why if you're on my friends list
2719000	2721000	And you're somewhere on the east coast, like I've been opening
2721000	2723000	Your presence a lot more lately
2723000	2725000	Like, if you're like Atlanta
2725000	2727000	Toronto, or I've got a little group
2727000	2729000	There's like some New York, some New Jersey, I'm like kinda
2729000	2731000	Figuring out who's where, I'm opening those gifts
2731000	2733000	When I have the holes in my inventory for Alolan eggs
2733000	2735000	Because if nothing else, if I get another fucking
2735000	2737000	Sandshrew or Grimer or something
2737000	2739000	I can trade it for a hella distance
2739000	2741000	And I think they're doing the same thing with my eggs
2741000	2743000	Because then the eggs in the west coast
2743000	2745000	You can at least trade for distance
2745000	2747000	And get that medal, which you know
2747000	2749000	The medal doesn't really mean anything, it's just EP
2749000	2751000	No, but for the people that are in those
2751000	2753000	Type of Discord groups, they want
2753000	2755000	They're full completionists, you know
2755000	2757000	They're checking their IVs, they're doing badges and medals
2757000	2759000	And things like that, so, it helps
2759000	2761000	Yeah, so, cool
2761000	2763000	Um, and then I think it's also fun to have
2763000	2765000	Pokemon from like, other places
2765000	2767000	Like, so now you have a Mewtwo from Sacramento
2767000	2769000	That will like, kinda remind you of that day
2769000	2771000	Oh yes, absolutely
2771000	2773000	Just like, my one and only Regirock
2773000	2775000	Is from Atlanta
2775000	2777000	So during Dragon Con, that was the only time I was actually able to
2777000	2779000	Capture Regirock, but then I also go
2779000	2781000	That was the time I got Bobby Blackwolf to actually
2781000	2783000	Do a Pokemon raid, so that's like
2783000	2785000	You know, like, woo, we got a little memory there
2785000	2787000	And then we traded Unknown today
2787000	2789000	And it became Lucky
2789000	2791000	Yeah, Lucky you
2791000	2793000	Yeah, he got the Lucky D
2793000	2795000	Because I gave him one of the Unknown, I got a Dragon Con
2795000	2797000	Because I saved like, you know, I basically
2797000	2799000	Don't have an Unknown yet here, here you go
2799000	2801000	You don't have one yet
2801000	2803000	Oh, really?
2803000	2805000	Remind me next episode, I'll get you one
2805000	2807000	So, then what left, you got the Lucky Unknown
2807000	2809000	But because you were like, what do you want
2809000	2811000	I'm like, my Contodex is done
2811000	2813000	There's like, literally nothing, just give me trash
2813000	2815000	So you gave me a Pidgey
2815000	2817000	I got a Lucky Pidgey
2817000	2819000	It's because you haven't gotten enough Lucky
2819000	2821000	Stuff yet
2821000	2823000	The first few trades you do
2823000	2825000	Like, first 10 trades are gonna be Lucky
2825000	2827000	So whatever I get from you is gonna be Lucky
2827000	2829000	So, yeah
2829000	2831000	Anyway, so that was, that was a little irritating
2831000	2833000	But anyway
2833000	2835000	Well, max out that Pidgey then
2835000	2837000	Yeah, you know what, actually because
2837000	2839000	When they're Lucky, they get good stats
2839000	2841000	And this guy is a 15 Attack
2841000	2843000	15 Defense
2843000	2845000	So I'm like, well, if nothing else, he might just
2845000	2847000	Be a funny Gym Defender
2847000	2849000	If nothing else, like,
2849000	2851000	Why not?
2851000	2853000	He'll be half price to level him up to
2854000	2856000	Level him up a little bit and throw him in a gym somewhere
2856000	2858000	Anyway, my game of the week, so I've been playing
2858000	2860000	Not just World of Warcraft
2860000	2862000	I'm not on the raiding thing
2862000	2864000	And I don't think I will be
2864000	2866000	But I just enjoy, like, the
2866000	2868000	World quests, just the leveling up
2868000	2870000	Experience, I started a new
2870000	2872000	Monk, just because I wanted to
2872000	2874000	Level up again, it seems like they fixed
2874000	2876000	A lot of the level sinking dungeons thing
2876000	2878000	Because when that patch first went in, I was pissed
2878000	2880000	I was not having a good time
2880000	2882000	But now it seems it's fine now
2882000	2884000	I did, okay, so the day that
2884000	2886000	Patch went in that rescaled
2886000	2888000	The old world where all the dungeons were 1-60
2888000	2890000	I went in and I got
2890000	2892000	Dire Maul or something, and it was
2892000	2894000	It was a shit show, because
2894000	2896000	People were not used to it the new way
2896000	2898000	And it was impossible to heal
2898000	2900000	So you could get
2900000	2902000	Dungeons that were
2902000	2904000	For level 60 at level 20?
2904000	2906000	No, they would still unlock later
2906000	2908000	My panda shaman
2908000	2910000	Was level 50, but we got that
2910000	2912000	But other people that were higher
2912000	2914000	Would get sinked down, like for example
2914000	2916000	I'm level 27, and I just queued for
2916000	2918000	Dungeon, I got Wailing Caverns at
2918000	2920000	27, but I was scaled down
2920000	2922000	To what a player in Wailing Caverns would be
2922000	2924000	Which is kind of like the 14 system
2924000	2926000	A little bit, it's this weird
2926000	2928000	Weird iteration of it, whereas like
2928000	2930000	14 just straight up level sinks you
2930000	2932000	It's a little different in a while
2932000	2934000	But anyway, I've been playing a lot of
2934000	2936000	Forza Horizon 4, I did a stream of that earlier
2936000	2938000	This week, and that game is fun
2938000	2940000	Forza is so extra
2940000	2942000	That's the greatest thing about it, and I love that
2942000	2944000	My character is named Potato
2944000	2946000	And they actually say, okay Potato
2946000	2948000	Do you want to go get some new influence?
2948000	2950000	Okay Potato, it's great to meet you Potato
2950000	2952000	Potato, we're gonna need you in a movie
2952000	2954000	So I just love that they call me Potato
2954000	2956000	Why do they call you Potato?
2956000	2958000	Because I ask them to
2958000	2960000	Because the game has
2960000	2962000	All these names loaded into it
2962000	2964000	They always call me Matt
2964000	2966000	Okay, here's the funny thing
2966000	2968000	I think it reads your Xbox profile
2968000	2970000	Because when I started the full game
2970000	2972000	They were like, do you want us to call you Rob?
2972000	2974000	And I was like
2974000	2976000	Let me see what the other names are
2976000	2978000	And the first page is all like
2978000	2980000	Quote unquote normal names
2980000	2982000	And they have a pretty impressive list
2982000	2984000	Of like 300 names
2984000	2986000	Sadly, not everybody's name is gonna be in there
2986000	2988000	Yeah, Delvin's not gonna be in there
2988000	2990000	If you have a unique name, it's not gonna be in there
2990000	2992000	Sorry, but if your name isn't in there
2992000	2994000	Then you go to page 2, which is
2994000	2996000	Nicknames
2996000	2998000	And there's all these different nicknames that they'll call you
2998000	3000000	So you can pick one
3000000	3002000	I don't know if they'll call you Mega Ma'am
3002000	3004000	I bet Mega is one of the names that they'll call you
3004000	3006000	And one of the names that was in there was Potato
3006000	3008000	So I was doing the stream
3008000	3010000	I was like
3010000	3012000	Perfect, that's a perfect name for me, Potato
3012000	3014000	Can I change that?
3014000	3016000	You can change it
3016000	3018000	You go into the menu and it's
3018000	3020000	Right where you pick your car
3020000	3022000	Wherever you customize your character
3022000	3024000	It's in the menu, it's not hard to miss
3024000	3026000	And you change it at any time
3026000	3028000	So if I feel like I don't want them to call me Potato anymore
3028000	3030000	But it's all voice acted
3030000	3032000	Like when I say they call me Potato
3032000	3034000	The voice acting says it
3034000	3036000	It's not just the text in the game
3036000	3038000	Naming your character in an RPG
3038000	3040000	Like butts, so that you make all the characters say
3040000	3042000	Get over here, butts
3042000	3044000	And all that stuff, right?
3044000	3046000	Anyway
3046000	3048000	But Fours is fun
3048000	3050000	I'm not quite in the open world yet
3050000	3052000	I don't really give my full thoughts because
3052000	3054000	I'm still making my way through the season
3054000	3056000	I didn't realize I'm not in the open world
3056000	3058000	I thought I was
3058000	3060000	There's like a pre-open world
3060000	3062000	So like you're still seeing everything
3062000	3064000	Like the other people and stuff
3064000	3066000	But I noticed today there were way less
3066000	3068000	People in there than there were when
3068000	3070000	The day the game came out
3070000	3072000	Because more people have gotten through it
3072000	3074000	So they're in the real open world now
3074000	3076000	I guess I should play through the game then
3076000	3078000	The seasons are on a fixed schedule
3078000	3080000	The schedule will change when you start
3080000	3082000	So it basically forces you to go
3082000	3084000	So the very first thing in the game
3084000	3086000	You play all the seasons in rapid succession
3086000	3088000	That's just to get you a taste, right?
3088000	3090000	But then when you start the game it's like, okay
3090000	3092000	It's autumn, go do this race, this race, and this race
3092000	3094000	And then it's gonna be winter
3094000	3096000	And then get this many fans
3096000	3098000	And it will be, you know, I'm assuming spring
3098000	3100000	And then summer
3100000	3102000	Once you get through all four seasons
3102000	3104000	Then you'll go into the real game mode
3104000	3106000	Where the seasons rotate like once a week
3106000	3108000	Like a real game week
3108000	3110000	So I think they had winter last week
3110000	3112000	So I would imagine it's spring in game right now
3112000	3114000	Or it's gonna turn to spring on Friday
3114000	3116000	And then that's when you're like racing
3116000	3118000	With other people and doing those events
3118000	3120000	Everybody's kind of on the same clock, so to speak
3120000	3122000	So, there's that
3124000	3126000	Yeah, gosh, I don't know what else to say
3126000	3128000	About Forza
3128000	3130000	If you think you might enjoy a new
3130000	3132000	Type of racing game, I urge you to check out the demo
3132000	3134000	I think Forza is one of the must-own
3134000	3136000	Titles on Xbox One
3136000	3138000	It honestly, in my opinion, is Microsoft's
3138000	3140000	Best exclusive right now
3140000	3142000	And yes, I'm including Halo
3142000	3144000	Fight me
3144000	3146000	So, Forza Horizon
3146000	3148000	Is Microsoft's best exclusive right now
3148000	3150000	And maybe I'll change my mind on that later
3150000	3152000	But these are must-have games if you own
3152000	3154000	An Xbox One
3154000	3156000	And even if you don't own an Xbox One, the great thing is
3156000	3158000	They're on PC
3158000	3160000	That's where I got mine, I don't need an Xbox One
3160000	3162000	That's the reason I got rid of my Xbox One
3162000	3164000	All the Xbox One games I wanted to play
3164000	3166000	Were all on PC, so I was like
3166000	3168000	Okay, well, time to get a PS4, and I traded it in
3168000	3170000	Yeah, so, I mean
3170000	3172000	Yeah, and I bought it
3172000	3174000	Digitally, so you get the whole like
3174000	3176000	I have it on PC, and if I want to
3176000	3178000	Play it on my Xbox One, I can't, which I did today
3178000	3180000	So you could watch a little bit, and see the game
3180000	3182000	You know, because my office is a little cramped
3182000	3184000	It's harder to watch me play on PC, so we
3184000	3186000	You know, did that a little bit, so
3186000	3188000	It's nice to- And your TV's bigger
3188000	3190000	Yeah, TV is a lot bigger, yeah, it's nicer, so
3190000	3192000	Anyway, um
3192000	3194000	Bonds006 says I want all Forza games on PC
3194000	3196000	Well, they probably will be in the future
3196000	3198000	Forza Horizon 3 was on PC, too
3198000	3200000	I don't know about Motorsport, because I don't follow
3200000	3202000	That series as closely, because I-
3202000	3204000	Seven is, I think
3204000	3206000	I prefer the arcade racers to the
3206000	3208000	Simulation racers, that's why you don't hear me talk
3208000	3210000	Like this about Gran Turismo
3210000	3212000	But I fucking love Mario Kart
3212000	3214000	And F-Zero, because those are arcade racers
3214000	3216000	There's a big difference
3216000	3218000	Burnout, I love that game, that's an arcade racer
3218000	3220000	I stand blur
3220000	3222000	Really hard, and I'm really sad that that franchise
3222000	3224000	Is gone, because that was more of an arcade racer, too
3224000	3226000	Um, so, that's
3226000	3228000	That's my thought
3228000	3230000	Let's see, what else, so we went to round one
3230000	3232000	I should quickly say, you got to have
3232000	3234000	Your first experience at round one
3234000	3236000	Yeah, I forgot to mention that in my, I guess as part
3236000	3238000	Of my gaming week
3238000	3240000	Oh, real quick, I just want to go back to Pokemon Go
3240000	3242000	Now, did you make sure to get one
3242000	3244000	Of those Pikachus with a hat, because they're
3244000	3246000	Very hard to find
3246000	3248000	No, they went away today
3248000	3250000	I'm glad you asked, Loki
3250000	3252000	I lucked out, I tapped the one on my house
3252000	3254000	Yesterday morning, not only was it a Pikachu
3254000	3256000	And a hat, it was a shiny Pikachu and a hat
3256000	3258000	So knowing that those, I mean, as annoying
3258000	3260000	Those little guys were, because they were everywhere
3260000	3262000	For like two days
3262000	3264000	Like, that makes that shiny
3264000	3266000	Really rare
3266000	3268000	So like, my Pokemon E-peen
3268000	3270000	Is really big right now, because not only
3270000	3272000	Did I get the shiny hat Pikachu, but I got
3272000	3274000	A shiny Drowzee today
3274000	3276000	My shiny E-peen is like
3276000	3278000	Real shiny right now
3278000	3280000	Real shiny
3280000	3282000	I bathed for you, anyway
3282000	3284000	Where were we? Oh yes, round one
3284000	3286000	Round one, speaking of shiny
3286000	3288000	In new places
3288000	3290000	So yeah, round one was amazing
3290000	3292000	It's huge, there's tons
3292000	3294000	Of arcade games in there
3294000	3296000	We don't really have
3296000	3298000	Very many arcades anymore
3298000	3300000	In the Toronto area
3300000	3302000	There was a place that opened up recently
3302000	3304000	Right near the CN Tower
3304000	3306000	And Skydome area
3306000	3308000	That has arcade in it
3308000	3310000	But it is a fraction
3310000	3312000	Of what is in round one
3312000	3314000	In terms of both ticket spinners
3314000	3316000	And arcade games
3316000	3318000	Like, round one
3318000	3320000	Just had a huge, a mass amount
3320000	3322000	Of games, so I was there
3322000	3324000	With you playing
3324000	3326000	I got to play some old fighting games
3326000	3328000	That I really enjoyed, they had Tatsunoko
3328000	3330000	Versus Capcom
3330000	3332000	Which I had never played, I had only played it on Wii
3332000	3334000	So it was fun to play that
3334000	3336000	I was playing some King of Fighters, I was playing some Street Fighter
3336000	3338000	And they had
3338000	3340000	Mario and Sonic
3340000	3342000	At the Rio Olympics
3342000	3344000	Which I didn't even know was an arcade game
3344000	3346000	And also Luigi's Mansion
3346000	3348000	I had no idea that
3348000	3350000	Yeah, they had one of those at Dave and Buster's
3350000	3352000	That was broken, aww
3352000	3354000	Yeah, I had no idea that these things
3354000	3356000	Were ever made as arcade games
3356000	3358000	And I'm kind of wondering why they're not more
3358000	3360000	Available
3360000	3362000	And rampant, but I guess it's just
3362000	3364000	Arcades probably aren't
3364000	3366000	As big money makers, why they have those
3366000	3368000	Stupid ticket spinners
3368000	3370000	Yeah, I got to play
3370000	3372000	The new BB&E 2DX
3372000	3374000	The Cannonball Rush, I think it's called
3374000	3376000	Which is a racing theme, I didn't realize that
3376000	3378000	But that's what they call it
3378000	3380000	And I actually played some of the new songs
3380000	3382000	Like, usually I'm really bad
3382000	3384000	Just ask JD, who goes to round one with me a lot
3384000	3386000	Like, when I go play 2DX, I'm really bad about
3386000	3388000	What's in 4 style that I can go back and play
3388000	3390000	So I, like, never play the new songs
3390000	3392000	But this time I really did play some of the new songs
3392000	3394000	There was some good stuff in there, it's just hard to hear in there
3394000	3396000	Yes, I was just gonna say
3396000	3398000	I was trying to do a rhythm game
3398000	3400000	I can't remember which one I was playing
3400000	3402000	To be honest
3402000	3404000	But it was very hard to play because I
3404000	3406000	Couldn't keep, I did not
3406000	3408000	Hear the music at all, period
3408000	3410000	I should have thought to tell you to bring headphones
3410000	3412000	And I didn't remember this myself, because a lot of people
3412000	3414000	You can put headphones in a lot of these jeans
3414000	3416000	Which is a great idea, because
3416000	3418000	Without it, you can't fucking hear shit in there
3420000	3422000	So, um, yeah
3422000	3424000	And I got to see Dance Rush, I didn't play it
3424000	3426000	Because the dance area was a little crowded
3426000	3428000	And I was, like, I'm gonna just keep it real
3428000	3430000	We had just had Lucille's BBQ
3430000	3432000	And so I was feeling very puffy
3432000	3434000	And I was not
3434000	3436000	I was not gonna get on
3436000	3438000	That was not the moment
3438000	3440000	And JD's like, come on, play, dance, dance
3440000	3442000	I'm like, you don't understand
3442000	3444000	If I get on that machine, it's gonna turn into
3444000	3446000	Dance, dance, fart
3450000	3452000	And none of y'all want that right now
3454000	3456000	Nobody deserves that kind of treatment
3456000	3458000	You don't deserve that type of treatment
3458000	3460000	The strangers don't deserve that type of treatment
3460000	3462000	It's not gonna happen
3462000	3464000	I am perfectly fine just watching
3464000	3466000	Although, there were people there who were doing
3466000	3468000	Their gym workouts there
3468000	3470000	Right?
3470000	3472000	There was a little bit of funk going on
3472000	3474000	They had their shorts and their little gym towels
3474000	3476000	Bottled water, like, they were full on
3476000	3478000	But then I think back
3478000	3480000	That's just how I played DDR though
3480000	3482000	I need those things in order to
3482000	3484000	Not be in your garage
3484000	3486000	I totally get it
3486000	3488000	Because if I don't have the towel
3488000	3490000	It's gonna be dripping all over the place
3490000	3492000	And then no one wants to slip in that
3492000	3494000	So, anyway
3494000	3496000	So I watched, and JD played
3496000	3498000	DDR, and he did go into
3498000	3500000	The retro mode, and he played
3500000	3502000	D2R, so I could see
3502000	3504000	The full background and how it emulates
3504000	3506000	DDR Extreme and all that, and it was silly
3506000	3508000	But in a good way
3508000	3510000	I appreciated the throwback
3510000	3512000	That was pretty cool that I got to see that
3512000	3514000	Anyway, very long
3514000	3516000	Winded answer to gaming week, but it was pretty busy
3516000	3518000	Because when you're here, I'm gonna take you to all the
3518000	3520000	Fun spots to play games. We never did make it
3520000	3522000	To coin-op, I was gonna take you there, but then I read
3522000	3524000	They didn't have a Killer Instinct machine
3524000	3526000	Which I wanted
3526000	3528000	Delvin needs to play Killer Instinct in the arcade
3528000	3530000	And I can't remember where around here has one
3530000	3532000	Maybe at that
3532000	3534000	Old arcade that's in Sutter
3534000	3536000	Street might have one
3536000	3538000	Oh, I always forget that place is there
3538000	3540000	Dang
3540000	3542000	Well, you know we might luck out
3542000	3544000	Because we're gonna go to Reno tomorrow
3544000	3546000	Which, that's a whole other story about why we're gonna go to Reno
3546000	3548000	But we are
3548000	3550000	And they have arcades there that time forgot
3550000	3552000	You might luck out and find it
3552000	3554000	Yeah, we'll go check them out
3554000	3556000	Oh, Pepper Mill
3556000	3558000	Has like that retro arcade
3558000	3560000	So, remind me
3560000	3562000	Go to Pepper Mill
3562000	3564000	Sounds like a plan
3564000	3566000	Alright, let's move on to some actual gaming news
3566000	3568000	And not casino talk
3568000	3570000	So, let's get into some gaming news with Loki
3570000	3572000	Starting us off tonight
3572000	3574000	So, since we're not gonna be talking about movies anymore
3574000	3576000	Yes, I know that you guys are disappointed
3576000	3578000	Let's talk about something else
3578000	3580000	That's coming soon
3580000	3582000	Rumored to be coming soon
3582000	3584000	A new model of the Nintendo Switch
3584000	3586000	According to the Wall Street Journal
3586000	3588000	Nintendo is gonna be introducing
3588000	3590000	A new version of the Switch
3590000	3592000	Next year
3592000	3594000	No word on what it is
3594000	3596000	Other than it will probably share some features
3596000	3598000	With the current version
3598000	3600000	And be compatible with existing Switch software
3600000	3602000	Well, you don't say
3602000	3604000	That's just a safe guess
3604000	3606000	Wall Street Journal
3606000	3608000	Nintendo is apparently
3608000	3610000	They're debating on what new hardware
3610000	3612000	And software features
3612000	3614000	To include in the upgrade
3614000	3616000	Here's an idea
3616000	3618000	If you don't know what to put in the upgrade
3618000	3620000	Don't fucking upgrade your system
3620000	3622000	Unless you have a plan
3622000	3624000	You don't need to upgrade it
3624000	3626000	If you have nothing to upgrade it with
3626000	3628000	And what do we really need to upgrade it with
3628000	3630000	I mean, the only thing I could see
3630000	3632000	That they could do
3632000	3634000	To add to the system
3634000	3636000	Really, is more storage
3636000	3638000	Cause 32GB onboard storage
3638000	3640000	Is fucking stupid nowadays
3640000	3642000	I'm imagining
3642000	3644000	This is gonna sound ridiculous Loki
3644000	3646000	But I think if they do
3646000	3648000	Like a 2019
3648000	3650000	My hope is that they would not segregate
3650000	3652000	Like they did with new 3DS and 3DS
3652000	3654000	Where you're gonna have shit like Xenoblade Chronicles
3654000	3656000	That only plays on new Switch
3656000	3658000	I would really hate to see that happen
3658000	3660000	This early in the game
3660000	3662000	Not that it's an impossibility
3662000	3664000	Because there is a potential that Nintendo might just go in there
3664000	3666000	And zhuzh it up a little bit
3666000	3668000	Zhuzh it up, meaning
3668000	3670000	Just a little more memory
3670000	3672000	A fancier screen
3672000	3674000	We're just gonna come in here and do a little makeover
3674000	3676000	Get the guys from Queer Eye to come
3676000	3678000	Get a little makeover
3678000	3680000	Just make sure Jonathan Van Ness
3680000	3682000	We're gonna patch out that taker chip
3682000	3684000	So you can't run that homebrew
3684000	3686000	Cause that's really what's got our knickers in a bunch
3686000	3688000	Make sure Jonathan Van Ness comes out and says gorgeous
3688000	3690000	This is a gorgeous screen, it's very gorgeous
3690000	3692000	We're gonna have a very gorgeous looking system here
3692000	3694000	So one of my theories
3694000	3696000	That we've talked about before
3696000	3698000	Is that
3698000	3700000	Pokemon is the big game that's obviously coming next year
3700000	3702000	Yes
3702000	3704000	And that still is a game that is geared towards kids
3704000	3706000	So
3706000	3708000	My theory
3708000	3710000	And thoughts is that
3710000	3712000	Whatever remake or redesign
3712000	3714000	Or upgrade that they're coming out with
3714000	3716000	Could potentially be
3716000	3718000	A portable only version
3718000	3720000	Of the Switch
3720000	3722000	That'll be a bit smaller for kids to use
3722000	3724000	And it'll be a bit cheaper
3724000	3726000	So that you're not giving your kid a
3726000	3728000	$300 handheld system that they'll
3728000	3730000	Throw around inevitably and throw on the ground
3730000	3732000	And whatever
3732000	3734000	So that might be the angle they're going
3734000	3736000	And then that will just be for people who only
3736000	3738000	Want to play the Switch on the go
3738000	3740000	They'll have like a better screen
3740000	3742000	Like a smartphone type screen
3742000	3744000	So for better battery life
3744000	3746000	Because we know that the Switch as it is now
3746000	3748000	Has poor battery life on the go
3748000	3750000	So I think that might
3750000	3752000	And it won't segregate the market that way
3752000	3754000	That's
3754000	3756000	An answer I'm comfortable with
3756000	3758000	That's a good answer
3758000	3760000	The Neon Family Feud, good answer
3762000	3764000	Here comes Loki
3764000	3766000	Here's why it's not gonna happen
3766000	3768000	The reason why it's only a 720p
3768000	3770000	Screen in the first place
3770000	3772000	Is because it can't run anything
3772000	3774000	Higher than that in portable mode
3774000	3776000	That's why it has to be plugged in because they're
3776000	3778000	Underclocking the CPU in that
3778000	3780000	GPU to be able to run what's on there
3780000	3782000	So
3782000	3784000	For them to put like a 1080p
3784000	3786000	Screen in there, it's just not gonna happen
3786000	3788000	Because they can't
3788000	3790000	Do it, so if anything
3790000	3792000	I don't
3792000	3794000	Really know, it's just an excuse
3794000	3796000	Really just to upgrade that chip so that
3796000	3798000	They can't have homebrew in there is really all
3798000	3800000	It is. I just hope if they do this
3800000	3802000	They take the 3DS out back
3802000	3804000	And shoot it
3804000	3806000	That also is kind of
3806000	3808000	My opinion segregating the portable market
3808000	3810000	Is that they still have these games like WarioWare
3810000	3812000	That are coming out on the 3DS
3812000	3814000	That we're not getting on the Switch now
3814000	3816000	Yes, I understand the WarioWare has like the
3816000	3818000	Blowing mechanics and some things that don't really
3818000	3820000	That don't really exist on the Switch
3820000	3822000	Right, like the microphone and everything
3822000	3824000	So I get it. There's a microphone on the Switch
3824000	3826000	Is there?
3826000	3828000	I think so. I don't think so
3828000	3830000	I think that's why everything had to go through a smartphone
3830000	3832000	Or you plug in a headphone or that whole thing
3832000	3834000	Because I don't think there's one built into it
3834000	3836000	There's no camera either like there is on the 3DS
3836000	3838000	So there's some things
3838000	3840000	So I understand why it can't be one for one
3840000	3842000	But like that Luigi's Mansion remake
3842000	3844000	That should be on the Switch
3844000	3846000	That should have been a Switch game
3846000	3848000	So I do hope if they're going to
3848000	3850000	Ask us to get this newer Switch
3850000	3852000	They really need to take the 3DS out back
3852000	3854000	And shoot it
3854000	3856000	They really need to have some pretty
3856000	3858000	Kick ass features that they're adding
3858000	3860000	To it to get people to want it
3860000	3862000	Because just look at all the
3862000	3864000	Refreshes that they've done with the 3DS
3864000	3866000	You know
3866000	3868000	Made it bigger
3868000	3870000	Added a little nub that no one wanted
3870000	3872000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says
3872000	3874000	I see where Delvin's going
3874000	3876000	Make a newer Switch that doesn't have
3876000	3878000	Detachable controllers
3878000	3880000	Doesn't have HDMI out or any of that type of stuff
3880000	3882000	They can remove components which will make the system
3882000	3884000	Overall cheaper
3884000	3886000	Not having detachable controllers is going to be a big mistake
3886000	3888000	Because here's one problem
3888000	3890000	First off you got games like Super Mario Party
3890000	3892000	Oh hey you want to play that game?
3892000	3894000	Well you got to detach the fucking controllers to play that game
3894000	3896000	Because we don't work in handheld mode
3896000	3898000	Well but that's because of the whole laying the screens next to each other
3898000	3900000	Thing which is kind of magic
3900000	3902000	I will say yeah
3902000	3904000	It's stupid
3904000	3906000	It's dumb though that you need to have it just to do the motion controls and stuff
3906000	3908000	But I feel like that whole laying the screens
3908000	3910000	Next to each other sort of thing
3910000	3912000	There's more to that
3912000	3914000	We're going to see in a later game
3914000	3916000	I think that might just be one mode of the game
3916000	3918000	No no but I mean that
3918000	3920000	Technology, that concept
3920000	3922000	We're going to see it again
3922000	3924000	And what better way to perhaps do that
3924000	3926000	If more people have more of the portable
3926000	3928000	To go version of Switch
3928000	3930000	Potentially
3930000	3932000	Alright well I mean we'll see where we go with it
3932000	3934000	I mean technically it is a rumor
3934000	3936000	They may not do anything but
3936000	3938000	I wouldn't
3938000	3940000	I wouldn't put it past Nintendo to do it
3940000	3942000	Because honestly
3942000	3944000	I don't know
3944000	3946000	Why redesign it now?
3947000	3949000	Unless you fix your stupid
3949000	3951000	Online support
3951000	3953000	With the whole app
3953000	3955000	Why do a PS4 mini
3955000	3957000	Two years after PS4 launches
3957000	3959000	I don't get that either
3959000	3961000	Or PS4 Pro
3961000	3963000	It makes sense because it has
3963000	3965000	You can push better graphics with it
3965000	3967000	It has stronger processing power
3967000	3969000	But it's
3969000	3971000	Not segregating the marketplace
3971000	3973000	Because it still runs
3973000	3975000	All the same games and everything
3975000	3977000	I don't see what
3977000	3979000	We may also be overthinking it to be fair
3979000	3981000	Because then my mind also goes
3981000	3983000	They did do a new Xbox One
3983000	3985000	Like just a year and it was a gig
3985000	3987000	Instead of
3987000	3989000	They did a different color or something too
3989000	3991000	It's not that big a deal
3991000	3993000	So maybe this whole thing
3993000	3995000	Is not going to be that big a deal
3995000	3997000	Like you said in the very beginning
3997000	3999000	More on board storage memory to start
3999000	4001000	And then maybe some different colors
4001000	4003000	I think it makes sense because
4003000	4005000	Having these installs with different games
4005000	4007000	People are buying stuff
4007000	4009000	More digitally
4009000	4011000	The indie game marketplace is seriously driving
4011000	4013000	I think a lot of sales for the system
4013000	4015000	Because there's not a ton of games coming out
4015000	4017000	Especially mainline
4017000	4019000	Switch games
4019000	4021000	Yes and no
4021000	4023000	Because I think at this point the Switch has the backlog
4023000	4025000	Where when somebody comes to me and says
4025000	4027000	If I buy a Switch what game should I buy
4027000	4029000	I'm sitting there going
4029000	4031000	Did you have a Wii U
4031000	4033000	And at the end of the time the answer is no
4033000	4035000	So I'm like alright
4035000	4037000	You need to get Breath of the Wild
4037000	4039000	You need to get Mario Odyssey
4039000	4041000	You need to get Mario Party 8
4041000	4043000	Do you like Skyrim?
4043000	4045000	You might need to get Skyrim
4045000	4047000	There's a growing library of Switch games
4047000	4049000	Bayonetta
4049000	4051000	I always recommend Bayonetta 1 and 2
4051000	4053000	There's a growing library of games now
4053000	4055000	I feel like the Switch doesn't need to justify
4055000	4057000	We don't have enough games to play on the Switch
4057000	4059000	You're thinking
4059000	4061000	TL Shade
4061000	4063000	That was Microsoft's problem
4063000	4065000	They didn't have enough exclusives
4065000	4067000	You can play Rise Son of Rome
4067000	4069000	But everything else
4069000	4071000	Microsoft was offering
4071000	4073000	At that time was on
4073000	4075000	PlayStation 4
4075000	4077000	Which is why
4077000	4079000	I'm bringing this up again because you and I were just talking about this last night
4079000	4081000	We were having a little nerd out
4081000	4083000	Nervous Lumber Party
4083000	4085000	I said how quickly we forget
4085000	4087000	Never forget
4087000	4089000	The biggest news
4089000	4091000	Out of E3 2018
4091000	4093000	Is that Microsoft acquired
4093000	4095000	A bunch of fucking studios
4095000	4097000	They are laying this
4097000	4099000	They are laying out this path
4099000	4101000	To get them back
4101000	4103000	In the front of the pack
4103000	4105000	And that is going to be
4105000	4107000	When they unleash whatever their next system is
4107000	4109000	They're going to have all these games
4109000	4111000	Only playable on Xbox
4111000	4113000	It's just the question is going to be
4113000	4115000	Are you going to put out Forza Horizon
4115000	4117000	Crackdown type games
4117000	4119000	As exclusives
4119000	4121000	Or are you going to put out Rise Son of Rome
4121000	4123000	Because one of them
4123000	4125000	Will make Microsoft in the lead
4125000	4127000	At least in the US
4127000	4129000	One of them? Pack it up
4129000	4131000	You all know what I mean
4131000	4133000	Alright
4133000	4135000	But anyway
4135000	4137000	In Nintendo's case
4137000	4139000	We've always known this is Nintendo's
4139000	4141000	Thing that is going to always put them
4141000	4143000	In a league of their own
4144000	4146000	Nintendo is the
4146000	4148000	The underscore bolded
4148000	4150000	The best
4150000	4152000	Game maker
4152000	4154000	Making video games
4154000	4156000	True story
4156000	4158000	I don't know if that's the case anymore
4158000	4160000	Honestly
4160000	4162000	I don't
4162000	4164000	There's a long pause because I'm looking
4164000	4166000	I gave him that look
4166000	4168000	I get it
4168000	4170000	Super Mario Odyssey was a great game
4170000	4172000	But I mean
4172000	4174000	Other companies make great games too
4174000	4176000	Sure
4176000	4178000	I'm just saying Nintendo's the best
4178000	4180000	I think we're giving them too much
4180000	4182000	We're giving them too much
4182000	4184000	Well it's fine that you're doing this bullshit
4184000	4186000	Because you made Super Mario Odyssey
4186000	4188000	It's fine that you're doing this bullshit
4188000	4190000	Because you made Breath of the Wild
4190000	4192000	I don't know
4192000	4194000	Bobby Blackwolf is trying to summarize
4194000	4196000	What you're saying
4196000	4198000	In quotes here
4198000	4200000	I get it Nintendo makes great games
4200000	4202000	It sucks
4204000	4206000	Yeah they suck at everything else
4206000	4208000	And you know what
4208000	4210000	I understand that you think it doesn't matter
4210000	4212000	They make great games
4212000	4214000	But if you're running it on hardware that doesn't make any fucking sense
4214000	4216000	Or they have shit that gets in the way
4216000	4218000	Then that's going to be the problem
4218000	4220000	I get it when people are like
4220000	4222000	Why won't Nintendo just put their games out on the
4222000	4224000	PlayStation 4 that would fix everything
4224000	4226000	I get it
4226000	4228000	Exactly
4228000	4230000	Wow that would be fucking awesome
4230000	4232000	That would be like gaming would never be better
4232000	4234000	Than if like
4234000	4236000	If Nintendo made games
4236000	4238000	For the Sony PlayStation 4
4238000	4240000	And Microsoft did all of the online component
4240000	4242000	Like that would be the perfect thing
4242000	4244000	Oh that would be perfect
4244000	4246000	Not going to ever fucking happen
4246000	4248000	But I might masturbate to that later
4248000	4250000	Great theory
4250000	4252000	Great idea
4252000	4254000	Never going to happen
4254000	4256000	Well let's see
4256000	4258000	I have to wait and see what the system is going to be
4258000	4260000	I might like
4260000	4262000	With everything with Nintendo my expectations are low
4262000	4264000	Alright let's move on
4264000	4266000	Let's talk about Fortnite
4266000	4268000	You want to talk about what's fucking huge in gaming right now
4268000	4270000	It doesn't matter what system you own
4270000	4272000	Because now we got the cross play problem solved
4272000	4274000	So this game is literally
4274000	4276000	Everywhere
4276000	4278000	Fortnite
4278000	4280000	It's on the phones, it's on the Switch, on the PS4
4280000	4282000	It's on the PC, it's on Macs
4282000	4284000	It's everywhere
4284000	4286000	Everybody's playing it during the Emmys
4286000	4288000	Yes as we learned on RuPaul's podcast
4288000	4290000	This last week
4290000	4292000	Carson Daly was playing Fortnite during the Emmys
4292000	4294000	Apparently
4294000	4296000	So anyway, Fortnite is still going
4296000	4298000	And now there's going to be more encouragement
4298000	4300000	To try to kind of keep that Fortnite
4300000	4302000	Train going
4302000	4304000	Because you know one place where
4304000	4306000	PUBG is probably
4306000	4308000	PUBG lost a lot of steam
4308000	4310000	They were the number one, number two game on Twitch
4310000	4312000	For a long time
4312000	4314000	And it seemed like PUBG news
4314000	4316000	Was getting really light
4316000	4318000	And they started to kind of fall behind a little bit
4318000	4320000	And I'm not totally shading PUBG
4320000	4322000	But that's just
4322000	4324000	Facts are facts
4324000	4326000	Go look at the Twitch standings
4326000	4328000	PUBG is not number one anymore
4328000	4330000	Facts are facts America
4330000	4332000	Epic wants to keep Fortnite out in the lead
4332000	4334000	So here's an idea
4334000	4336000	Why not pay content creators
4336000	4338000	And this is
4338000	4340000	This is like
4340000	4342000	Interesting because I can't think of a lot of
4342000	4344000	Game makers
4344000	4346000	Because you know some game makers
4346000	4348000	Want to stop content creators
4348000	4350000	Maybe that's not
4350000	4352000	Completely fair but you know what I mean
4352000	4354000	Sometimes they hold them back a little bit
4354000	4356000	But Epic is launching a
4356000	4358000	Support a creator event
4358000	4360000	That will send real money
4360000	4362000	To folks on Twitch and YouTube
4362000	4364000	When gamers make purchases with
4364000	4366000	V-Bucks
4366000	4368000	So starting October 8th until the end of
4368000	4370000	18 if you put in the name
4370000	4372000	Of a creator in Fortnite's
4372000	4374000	Shop to reward them
4374000	4376000	When you buy a costume or glider
4376000	4378000	So you know
4378000	4380000	Guess what you're gonna start hearing on every
4380000	4382000	Podcast who knows maybe this one I don't know
4382000	4384000	It's gonna be use offer code
4384000	4386000	O-L-R at checkout
4388000	4390000	That's offer code O-L-R
4390000	4392000	Yeah that's right it's offer code
4392000	4394000	O-L-R
4394000	4396000	At checkout
4396000	4398000	Watch watch these content
4398000	4400000	Creators of Fortnite wait for it
4400000	4402000	And let's find our best content creators
4402000	4404000	Plugging their offer codes
4404000	4406000	That they're gonna put in at checkout
4406000	4408000	This is standard business nowadays because you know
4408000	4410000	You're not getting paid by YouTube
4410000	4412000	Or Twitch that much
4412000	4414000	I mean so you gotta make your money
4414000	4416000	Somewhere but this is interesting because
4416000	4418000	The only like
4418000	4420000	Qualifications for this you have to
4420000	4422000	Produce Fortnite related material in the
4422000	4424000	Past 30 days have at
4424000	4426000	Least 1,000 social
4426000	4428000	Media followers which sounds high
4428000	4430000	But social media like I have
4430000	4432000	That on Twitter like not to be that
4432000	4434000	Guy but like you know if you have
4434000	4436000	Been on social media and working
4436000	4438000	All that long enough and frequent enough you're
4438000	4440000	Probably gaining a lot of followers
4440000	4442000	So um and I
4442000	4444000	Didn't see if that is a thousand YouTube
4444000	4446000	A thousand Twitch I don't know but you have to
4446000	4448000	Have a thousand followers and you have to
4448000	4450000	Avoid illegal or toxic
4450000	4452000	Behavior so you can't be a jerk
4452000	4454000	Fair enough
4454000	4456000	It's not gonna be it's not gonna pay your mortgage
4456000	4458000	50,000 V-Bucks
4458000	4460000	That's about $500
4460000	4462000	The creator will get $25
4462000	4464000	So that's like 5%
4464000	4466000	Which I mean
4466000	4468000	It's not a bad
4468000	4470000	It's right it's better than nothing
4470000	4472000	Somebody like Ninja
4472000	4474000	Oh he's gonna be raking it in
4474000	4476000	Oh it is he's gonna be he's gonna fill a bathtub
4476000	4478000	Full of money it's gonna be like that scene with Demi
4478000	4480000	Morin in Decent Proposal where she's laughing on the
4480000	4482000	Bedroll that's gonna be Ninja
4482000	4484000	Okay it already is Ninja
4484000	4486000	Anyway
4486000	4488000	So yeah it's gonna incentivize
4488000	4490000	Content creators to move
4490000	4492000	And Loki yes in some ways
4492000	4494000	Like you know there's
4494000	4496000	Other ways that content creators can make money
4496000	4498000	Through like biddies on Twitch and subscriptions
4498000	4500000	And all that but you know what
4500000	4502000	Knowing that wow if I keep playing
4502000	4504000	Fortnite I can make a little more
4504000	4506000	Money is gonna keep people
4506000	4508000	Playing Fortnite it's smart
4508000	4510000	It even makes me wanna go
4510000	4512000	I have a thousand social media followers
4512000	4514000	Maybe I need to play Fortnite some night
4514000	4516000	I'm not gonna but I hope some other companies
4516000	4518000	It would be pretty cool if they follow up on this
4518000	4520000	It would be pretty rad
4520000	4522000	And then it's kind of a
4522000	4524000	Another way to keep
4524000	4526000	Fortnite popular cause
4526000	4528000	If Fortnite just stays on Twitch
4528000	4530000	Or YouTube as the number one most
4530000	4532000	Watched game
4532000	4534000	It just keeps it in people's face
4534000	4536000	It does it does
4536000	4538000	Here's the new mode here's the new stuff here's all the new
4538000	4540000	Crap you can buy on the online marketplace
4540000	4542000	For sure for sure anyway well let's move
4542000	4544000	On Loki
4544000	4546000	Alright
4546000	4548000	So apparently
4548000	4550000	For the longest time we've been asking
4550000	4552000	For the ability to be able to change our
4552000	4554000	PlayStation Network
4554000	4556000	User names
4556000	4558000	And Sony's always said
4558000	4560000	Oh yeah don't worry we'll have something worked out
4560000	4562000	Soon you know we're working on it we're looking into
4562000	4564000	It blah blah blah
4564000	4566000	Well that might actually be getting closer because
4566000	4568000	Apparently
4568000	4570000	There's been some game studios
4570000	4572000	That have been speaking anonymously
4572000	4574000	To different social
4574000	4576000	Media outlets and letting them
4576000	4578000	Know that hey
4578000	4580000	That they've been
4580000	4582000	Participating in bug fixing
4582000	4584000	And tweaking settings and stuff like that
4584000	4586000	To make sure that it's gonna be compatible
4586000	4588000	Their games are compatible with these
4588000	4590000	PlayStation Network name profile
4590000	4592000	Changes or user names
4592000	4594000	So they have like the option
4594000	4596000	To edit user name
4596000	4598000	They have like a guide
4598000	4600000	That they've been going off of to kind of
4600000	4602000	Work on it so it is something that is coming up
4602000	4604000	Um
4604000	4606000	We don't know when yet
4606000	4608000	I remember that they were originally talking that
4608000	4610000	They're gonna make the announcement at PSX
4610000	4612000	But that's not gonna happen this year so maybe
4612000	4614000	Around that time maybe the end
4614000	4616000	Of this year I don't know there's nothing to stop them
4616000	4618000	From just doing an internet press release I mean
4618000	4620000	That's the way you can do things now
4620000	4622000	So they've got that PlayStation blog
4622000	4624000	They've got a Twitter account
4624000	4626000	They dump a bombshell like that
4626000	4628000	And it's gonna run around the internet real quick
4628000	4630000	So that's something people have been asking
4630000	4632000	For it does seem ridiculous
4632000	4634000	That now it's like 2018 and we're still
4634000	4636000	Oh my god Sony might allow you the
4636000	4638000	Ability to change your name real soon y'all
4638000	4640000	I wonder what the reason behind that is
4640000	4642000	It's gotta do something with the infrastructure
4642000	4644000	There's gotta be something rooted in
4644000	4646000	Yeah I think it was their infrastructure where they had the
4646000	4648000	User names like the accounts were tied
4648000	4650000	To the user name it wasn't tied to like some
4650000	4652000	Number that the user name was like
4652000	4654000	You know tied to the account
4654000	4656000	Yeah so now they have to
4656000	4658000	Go back and rework all that shit so that
4658000	4660000	It's now tied to this universal number
4660000	4662000	That your user name is then tied to that
4662000	4664000	Account so you can change it
4664000	4666000	Or whatever it just it just seems weird
4666000	4668000	That it would have taken this long to get here
4668000	4670000	Because I mean and then again
4670000	4672000	I don't know as much about networking
4672000	4674000	And infrastructure so I will be the first to admit
4674000	4676000	Maybe I'm just ignorant to how
4676000	4678000	Hard this really is
4678000	4680000	But why wouldn't they have just
4680000	4682000	At some point
4682000	4684000	Taken Playstation Network down for a day
4684000	4686000	To say we're gonna run this thing
4686000	4688000	That's gonna change all your
4688000	4690000	User names behind the scenes into a number
4690000	4692000	And then that number is now you
4692000	4694000	But you won't see it because now you have your name
4694000	4696000	And then now if you wanna change your name it's fine
4696000	4698000	Cause we put in those numbers behind the scene
4698000	4700000	That's why we took Playstation Network down for a day
4700000	4702000	Like
4702000	4704000	Am I crazy?
4704000	4706000	Whenever there's a database
4706000	4708000	And someone's
4708000	4710000	Information is in there
4710000	4712000	That information is tied to an
4712000	4714000	ID and that could be a number
4714000	4716000	It could be a name it's just something that's
4716000	4718000	A unique identifier and they probably
4718000	4720000	Chose the user name to be that unique identifier
4720000	4722000	Which was a poor choice
4722000	4724000	Now that I know in Microsoft Access you always
4724000	4726000	Have your key field
4726000	4728000	So they
4728000	4730000	Basically chose the user name to be the unique
4730000	4732000	Identifier instead of it being
4732000	4734000	Some other number behind the
4734000	4736000	Scene usually a key that's like numbers
4736000	4738000	And letters and now
4738000	4740000	So if you change it it almost
4740000	4742000	Fucks up the account and then maybe
4742000	4744000	This would've prevented the hack because we would've
4744000	4746000	Never well no because I was like maybe
4746000	4748000	They would've only seen that random numbers of letters
4748000	4750000	And numbers and not you know the user names but
4750000	4752000	Actually no they would've still pulled
4752000	4754000	The other yeah yeah anyway
4754000	4756000	Alright anyway let's move on I wanna talk about
4756000	4758000	This because I think I don't know if this is gonna be
4758000	4760000	So much a game but it's like VR
4760000	4762000	It's gonna be Oculus
4762000	4764000	And HTC Vive
4764000	4766000	And I don't know about you guys but I'm
4766000	4768000	Super into it and this is
4768000	4770000	A new VR experience
4770000	4772000	I don't know if it's like a game
4772000	4774000	But knowing what it is
4774000	4776000	It's probably gonna be like
4776000	4778000	Like what is it anyway
4778000	4780000	It's Twin Peaks is what it is so Twin Peaks
4780000	4782000	Y'all know it was a show
4782000	4784000	Back in the 90's on ABC but then they
4784000	4786000	Brought it back recently on Showtime
4786000	4788000	And I was a fan of the old
4788000	4790000	Series and I loved the new one too
4790000	4792000	Even though there was a lot of like
4792000	4794000	Especially like
4794000	4796000	Here's the thing with Twin Peaks
4796000	4798000	The next to last episode like if they had
4798000	4800000	Ended it with that it would've been like
4800000	4802000	They kinda answered a lot of the questions
4802000	4804000	They kept some things open I love the way that
4804000	4806000	Next to last episode ended but then
4806000	4808000	In true David Lynch form there's a
4808000	4810000	Full another episode after that that keeps
4810000	4812000	Going that the entire thing
4812000	4814000	Is just what the
4814000	4816000	Fuck and that's
4816000	4818000	How it ends but that's
4818000	4820000	But you go to see a David
4820000	4822000	Lynch anything you need to be prepared
4822000	4824000	To be walking out of that theater going
4824000	4826000	What the actual
4826000	4828000	Fuck was that
4828000	4830000	And that was what happened when I saw Lost Highway
4830000	4832000	Years ago in the theater as I left out
4832000	4834000	What the fuck
4834000	4836000	Keske fuck
4836000	4838000	Anyway
4838000	4840000	So maybe that's gonna be the same thing
4840000	4842000	When you do Twin Peaks VR is that you're gonna be
4842000	4844000	Putting that going into that and then like what the fuck
4844000	4846000	I have never watched Twin Peaks ever
4846000	4848000	Really you should
4848000	4850000	Here's the thing in my
4850000	4852000	Personal opinion the first
4852000	4854000	Season that was on ABC that's
4854000	4856000	Only like 7 episodes or something like that
4856000	4858000	Is like a must watch
4858000	4860000	It is really fucking good and like
4860000	4862000	You see things
4862000	4864000	There that they weren't doing in TV
4864000	4866000	In the 90's that people are doing
4866000	4868000	Now the second
4868000	4870000	Season of the show like
4870000	4872000	If you like the first season and you
4872000	4874000	Want to get more of the story you should watch the
4874000	4876000	Second season only because it
4876000	4878000	Kind of continues it but it does get
4878000	4880000	Weaker throughout the second season
4880000	4882000	Because David Lynch didn't do all of it
4882000	4884000	The network put a lot
4884000	4886000	Of pressure to reveal Laura Palmer's
4886000	4888000	Killer before they really wanted to do it
4888000	4890000	And it kind of went downhill after they revealed a killer
4890000	4892000	But there are elements
4892000	4894000	In that that then come back
4894000	4896000	In Twin Peaks
4896000	4898000	The Return so if you're not gonna
4898000	4900000	Watch the second season at least read
4900000	4902000	The cliff notes read the spoilers read through it
4902000	4904000	And then watch The Return because
4904000	4906000	In my opinion The Return like
4906000	4908000	Is like there
4908000	4910000	It's crazy because like I said the 90's
4910000	4912000	Version of Twin Peaks there was nothing like it
4912000	4914000	On TV then The Return
4914000	4916000	There's nothing like it on TV
4916000	4918000	Now like there was a
4918000	4920000	Particular episode of that show
4920000	4922000	And any of you that watch it will know that I was talking
4922000	4924000	About that was like
4924000	4926000	40 minutes of just
4926000	4928000	Pure
4928000	4930000	What the
4930000	4932000	Fuck am I watching
4932000	4934000	But like you sit there at the end of it
4934000	4936000	And going I think
4936000	4938000	I understood a third
4938000	4940000	Of that
4940000	4942000	But it was really fucking brilliant
4942000	4944000	That that was art
4944000	4946000	I don't know what it was
4946000	4948000	But it was art
4950000	4952000	And any of you that have watched the revival series
4952000	4954000	Know exactly which episode I'm talking about
4954000	4956000	Anyway
4956000	4958000	I'm sorry I'm finally looking at chat over
4958000	4960000	At live.vognetwork.com
4960000	4962000	As Joe and Hunter Matt said I stopped trying to make sense
4962000	4964000	Of David Lynch after the 90's if you try to
4964000	4966000	You're just gonna hurt your brain yep pretty much
4966000	4968000	Anyway
4968000	4970000	So Twin Peaks VR
4970000	4972000	Where this whole thing was supposed to be started
4972000	4974000	So Twin Peaks VR is gonna put you in the Red
4974000	4976000	Room which is a very important place
4976000	4978000	In Twin Peaks mythology
4978000	4980000	This could be considered a minor
4980000	4982000	Spoiler but the Red Room
4982000	4984000	Is basically like you could think of it as like
4984000	4986000	A gateway to hell that's kind of like what I
4986000	4988000	Sort of look at it as is that the Red Room is like
4988000	4990000	A gateway to hell
4990000	4992000	So anyway
4992000	4994000	Twin Peaks also gets into this whole mythology
4994000	4996000	About that there could be doppelgangers
4996000	4998000	In the world that you may have
4998000	5000000	Somebody that looks exactly like you but they are
5000000	5002000	From this bad place type of thing
5002000	5004000	Do they have a goatee?
5004000	5006000	Um
5006000	5008000	Not necessarily
5008000	5010000	But I'll leave it at that
5010000	5012000	Anyway so
5012000	5014000	Twin Peaks VR is gonna take you in this Red Room
5014000	5016000	And you'll be in there
5016000	5018000	And you're gonna they say in the game
5018000	5020000	You wind up in the Red Room and
5020000	5022000	Fans of the series will follow in the footsteps of
5022000	5024000	Dale Cooper to try to make their way back
5024000	5026000	Into the life that they left behind
5026000	5028000	So there will be places and dialogues
5028000	5030000	From the original series and the sequel
5030000	5032000	It's gonna be made for the HTC Vive
5032000	5034000	And the Rift it's only gonna be available
5034000	5036000	On Steam we don't know when it's gonna come
5036000	5038000	Out but they are showing it next
5038000	5040000	Weekend at the Festival of
5040000	5042000	Disruption in Los Angeles
5042000	5044000	Which I believe is a David Lynch or at least
5044000	5046000	David Lynch has a large part of this
5046000	5048000	Festival thing going on cause you know
5048000	5050000	Katya is actually gonna be performing at it too
5050000	5052000	Random?
5052000	5054000	Well because no Katya fucking loves Twin Peaks
5054000	5056000	Like her thing
5056000	5058000	At DragCon New York City where you took a
5058000	5060000	Picture of her she fucking her set
5060000	5062000	Was the Red Room from Twin Peaks
5062000	5064000	And she's actually made outfits
5064000	5066000	Inspired by Twin Peaks like she's
5066000	5068000	She's a stan She's very into it
5068000	5070000	And that's why I love her cause she loves
5070000	5072000	That weird shit so anyway
5072000	5074000	Sadly
5074000	5076000	No word if it's gonna be on PlayStation
5076000	5078000	VR
5078000	5080000	Cause you know that would be a nice thing
5080000	5082000	So anyway
5082000	5084000	Do you get pie though?
5084000	5086000	No word if there will be a damn fine cup of coffee
5086000	5088000	Involved no word on that yet
5088000	5090000	Or if there will be random dancing to songs
5090000	5092000	Playing on the jukebox who knows
5092000	5094000	Anyway I think we should move on to other
5094000	5096000	Other weird television shows
5096000	5098000	And things that have spawned from them right Loki?
5098000	5100000	Yes like The Walking Dead
5100000	5102000	Unfortunately like The Walking Dead
5102000	5104000	We might also kind of compare The Walking Dead
5104000	5106000	To Telltale
5106000	5108000	Which is kind of Walking Dead
5108000	5110000	Of it's own
5110000	5112000	Being that they've laid off 90%
5112000	5114000	Of their staff
5114000	5116000	But that's not all because they're continuing
5116000	5118000	To lay off people as well
5118000	5120000	So
5120000	5122000	They had a skeleton crew
5122000	5124000	That was you know left behind to kind of
5124000	5126000	Finish up some of the stuff on The Walking Dead
5126000	5128000	And also
5128000	5130000	The interactive Minecraft
5130000	5132000	Series that's supposed to be on
5132000	5134000	Netflix well
5134000	5136000	Now of course with that
5136000	5138000	They're going to be letting
5138000	5140000	Some of those people go as well
5140000	5142000	Because now they have another
5142000	5144000	Team that's gonna be working on
5144000	5146000	The
5146000	5148000	Walking Dead series
5148000	5150000	So they said everyone involved is trying to make sure
5150000	5152000	Clementines story is told
5152000	5154000	I'm not concerned at the moment with
5154000	5156000	Telling that story
5156000	5158000	In the comics
5158000	5160000	They said that
5160000	5162000	As odd as it may sound 25 of us will continue
5162000	5164000	Foreseeable
5164000	5166000	I'll make further comment
5166000	5168000	In the coming weeks after today's events
5168000	5170000	It's not clear of
5170000	5172000	How many of those 25 will
5172000	5174000	Remain because they're not trying
5174000	5176000	To necessarily
5176000	5178000	Keep them around I guess since they have
5178000	5180000	Another studio going to be working on it
5180000	5182000	And so yeah with that there is gonna be
5182000	5184000	The series will be finished by
5184000	5186000	Another company so they've got
5186000	5188000	Skybound Games is gonna be
5188000	5190000	Completing season 4
5190000	5192000	Of The Walking Dead
5192000	5194000	And of course they made an announcement on
5194000	5196000	Twitter saying we're so happy to
5196000	5198000	Announce that we've reached a deal with Telltale Games
5198000	5200000	That will allow Skybound
5200000	5202000	To continue The Walking Dead final
5202000	5204000	Season more details
5204000	5206000	To come I want to say that they were
5206000	5208000	Trying to
5208000	5210000	They're working with the original Telltale team
5210000	5212000	To finish the story
5212000	5214000	The way that the fans deserve
5214000	5216000	Um
5216000	5218000	Still disappointing to see that they're
5218000	5220000	You know letting go all those people
5220000	5222000	Without severance and now they have another team
5222000	5224000	Working on the game that doesn't make any sense but
5224000	5226000	That's what they're doing
5226000	5228000	I don't know
5228000	5230000	I don't really
5230000	5232000	Follow the walking dead
5232000	5234000	Games I know that they're pretty good but
5234000	5236000	It kinda sucks cause you know
5236000	5238000	The quality is gonna be quite
5238000	5240000	I don't know if it's gonna be up there with the other
5240000	5242000	Games
5242000	5244000	Yeah this is really unexplored territory too
5244000	5246000	With the studio closing and a lot of people
5246000	5248000	Have very strong feelings about how Telltale
5248000	5250000	Has treated those employees
5250000	5252000	But yet at the same time
5252000	5254000	Telltale has created these obligations
5254000	5256000	To customers out there that they are
5256000	5258000	Also not gonna be able to follow up on
5258000	5260000	You know now they've got this whole exchange
5260000	5262000	But there's this whole like
5262000	5264000	Duality now where it's like okay
5264000	5266000	Well who is more important in this scenario
5266000	5268000	The obligation to the customer
5268000	5270000	Or the obligation to the employees
5270000	5272000	Because this is gonna be
5272000	5274000	Great in I guess fulfilling
5274000	5276000	That obligation to the customer even though
5276000	5278000	The quality may be who knows what
5278000	5280000	I suppose it depends on how many of those Telltale
5280000	5282000	Employees they get but it's not
5282000	5284000	Gonna really address the concern of how
5284000	5286000	To Telltale treat the employees
5286000	5288000	Sure some of them may be able to come
5288000	5290000	On but we know it's not gonna be all of them
5290000	5292000	Some of those folks have probably already
5292000	5294000	Moved on to new jobs
5294000	5296000	I don't know if like honestly if it were
5296000	5298000	Me you know unless you're really really
5298000	5300000	Passionate about like your job and stuff
5300000	5302000	Like I can't imagine like oh I
5302000	5304000	Got fired without severance yeah
5304000	5306000	And now you want me to work on that game again
5306000	5308000	That's very true and those
5308000	5310000	Employees have every right like even if they extend
5310000	5312000	This offer and say would you like to come finish the game
5312000	5314000	These employees have every right to say go take a hike
5314000	5316000	Like just I'm not interested
5316000	5318000	Because I have bad memories
5318000	5320000	With that are they being asked to come back
5320000	5322000	With pay or like just make it
5322000	5324000	The game well I would assume I would
5324000	5326000	Assume with pay if it's a new company that's
5326000	5328000	Taking on the obligation to finish it
5328000	5330000	The company this new company would hire
5330000	5332000	Them and do what they need to do
5332000	5334000	We'll give you some exposure yeah
5334000	5336000	Anyway
5336000	5338000	D'artitsuya in chat says
5338000	5340000	The Telltale news for sure sucks but at the very
5340000	5342000	Least the story gets to be completed
5342000	5344000	Not that I'm letting them off the hook and I guess
5344000	5346000	That's where my mind is at
5346000	5348000	Is I'm like okay this
5348000	5350000	Is going to help with half the problem
5350000	5352000	The obligation to the customers
5352000	5354000	Will get filled
5354000	5356000	Even though the quality is still
5356000	5358000	TBD we'll give them the benefit
5358000	5360000	Of the doubt and hope it's going to be a great
5360000	5362000	Maybe is that going to give them more money to
5362000	5364000	Pay these severances or are they just
5364000	5366000	Pocketing that that would be fabulous
5366000	5368000	And then maybe address some of the concern
5368000	5370000	About what happened to the other half
5370000	5372000	But unfortunately the realist
5372000	5374000	In me is like this new
5374000	5376000	Company has
5376000	5378000	No need
5378000	5380000	I mean has no obligation to pay
5380000	5382000	Another company's
5382000	5384000	Severance you know what I mean
5384000	5386000	And please please do not misinterpret
5386000	5388000	What I'm saying those people deserve to be treated
5388000	5390000	Better but that's not this
5390000	5392000	Company that's trying to come in and fix some of the
5392000	5394000	Problems it's not their problem
5394000	5396000	They're selling the rights to this company
5396000	5398000	To like make the game because
5398000	5400000	It's their series but maybe they're
5400000	5402000	Getting like a portion of that
5402000	5404000	You know those profits
5404000	5406000	Going back to their original telltale company
5406000	5408000	Because it's their game
5408000	5410000	Well and then I hope that money gets redistributed to the
5410000	5412000	Employees because the management
5412000	5414000	And the board don't deserve a fucking dime
5414000	5416000	But aren't they just finishing the
5416000	5418000	Stories for what people have
5418000	5420000	Already paid for yes so that
5420000	5422000	Means there's no new money coming in
5422000	5424000	These people have already paid for this
5424000	5426000	Game and what money they
5426000	5428000	Made already wasn't enough to pay severance
5428000	5430000	So there isn't any new money coming in
5430000	5432000	To finish whatever chapters are left
5432000	5434000	Correct so
5434000	5436000	Yeah no it sucks so this new company that's
5436000	5438000	Doing it isn't gonna get a dime
5438000	5440000	Really because people have already paid for the
5440000	5442000	Content unless new people come on
5442000	5444000	Later and buy
5444000	5446000	The whole thing but
5446000	5448000	For the most part they're just fulfilling back orders
5448000	5450000	Right yeah and that's why I'm like
5450000	5452000	The new company like even
5452000	5454000	Though I have a hard time saying yay
5454000	5456000	Everything is better okay I'm
5456000	5458000	Gonna get this new company is doing a good thing
5458000	5460000	I think it's good intentioned and they're trying
5460000	5462000	To fix some of the problem what
5462000	5464000	They can do fixing
5464000	5466000	This problem with the severance and everything I don't
5466000	5468000	Think this new company can do at least not
5468000	5470000	Now not unless a ton of people buy
5470000	5472000	This game and they made buku bucks but
5472000	5474000	At that point I mean how long
5474000	5476000	Before these games come out and turn a profit it's
5476000	5478000	Probably gonna take some time you know and
5478000	5480000	Even then these other folks hopefully will
5480000	5482000	Have moved on but likely add to new
5482000	5484000	Jobs it's just it's a shitty
5484000	5486000	Situation and it's telltale management's
5486000	5488000	Fault and it's unfortunate
5488000	5490000	I hope the industry
5490000	5492000	As a whole is kind of watching
5492000	5494000	What's happening to this and
5494000	5496000	Especially how pissed off a lot of people
5496000	5498000	Are getting about it and especially how
5498000	5500000	It's moving more and more game
5500000	5502000	Makers to kind of go you know
5502000	5504000	Maybe we do need to unionize
5504000	5506000	And it could be very interesting if this
5506000	5508000	Is gonna be the the straw that
5508000	5510000	Start or the what was
5510000	5512000	An analogy I can use here the rock that starts
5512000	5514000	The avalanche so to speak with that whole thing
5514000	5516000	So all right
5516000	5518000	Let's move on one more thing here before we get to the classic
5518000	5520000	Game of the week I want to talk about a beloved
5520000	5522000	Game from the past I don't know about you guys but I
5522000	5524000	Always love this game did you guys ever play a game called
5524000	5526000	Descent on PC?
5526000	5528000	Yeah it was pretty cool because it kind of came out
5528000	5530000	In that first person era when
5530000	5532000	Doom and Wolfenstein really started
5532000	5534000	Taking off but Descent was really
5534000	5536000	The first game that had the full
5536000	5538000	360 degrees of movement
5538000	5540000	Cause like in Doom you move forward
5540000	5542000	Back side side but in Descent
5542000	5544000	You were a ship and you flew
5544000	5546000	Around rooms and you really had
5546000	5548000	360 degrees of movement so they
5548000	5550000	Made a few Descent games within the series
5550000	5552000	Kind of went kaput well
5552000	5554000	Apparently a new Descent
5554000	5556000	Game is coming out next year
5556000	5558000	On PC and consoles
5558000	5560000	So it was announced by
5560000	5562000	Little Orbit who is a independent
5562000	5564000	Video game publisher and Descendant
5564000	5566000	Studios they are making
5566000	5568000	A reimagining of
5568000	5570000	Descent you will be going through
5570000	5572000	Twisting tunnels and caverns
5572000	5574000	Where again like the originals up and
5574000	5576000	Down is you know you're gonna
5576000	5578000	Move all over the place you have to be able to think
5578000	5580000	In 360 degrees
5580000	5582000	So anyway they say
5582000	5584000	This is actually a Kickstarter project from a long
5584000	5586000	Time ago so it took about 3 years
5586000	5588000	To get here but the retail and digital release
5588000	5590000	For PC, Xbox One, and Playstation 4
5590000	5592000	Is early 2019 the
5592000	5594000	Switch is now included in this so you can
5594000	5596000	Play Descent if you wanna you know throw up on the
5596000	5598000	Go by spinning in all those different directions
5598000	5600000	You can do that if you
5600000	5602000	Pre-order now you will get access
5602000	5604000	To a PC beta starting later
5604000	5606000	This year a custom version of the
5606000	5608000	Generation 3 Voila ship
5608000	5610000	With a new paint job
5610000	5612000	PC beta challenges
5612000	5614000	Multi-pass upgrade for multiplayer
5614000	5616000	Secret missions DLC
5616000	5618000	You know all the extra crap they tack on to games
5618000	5620000	These days so anyway kind of
5620000	5622000	Neat the Descent is coming back and
5622000	5624000	Always nice to see a Kickstarter come full
5624000	5626000	Circle and actually get its release
5626000	5628000	And be fully realized which sadly
5628000	5630000	Doesn't happen 100% of the time
5630000	5632000	But we're getting there
5632000	5634000	Would anyone want to check out the new Descent game
5634000	5636000	I'm curious about it
5636000	5638000	I love the old one
5638000	5640000	Sorry I was texting with my wife apparently they launched
5640000	5642000	A Falcon 9 rocket near by
5642000	5644000	You can actually see it outside
5644000	5646000	Really? Yeah
5646000	5648000	Yeah pretty close like
5648000	5650000	She sent me pictures she's like what the hell is that
5650000	5652000	Why are they launching rockets
5652000	5654000	Fuck if I know
5654000	5656000	Random
5656000	5658000	Delvin I hope your trip
5658000	5660000	To the US doesn't end in tragedy
5660000	5662000	Why are they launching no I'm
5662000	5664000	I'm obviously kidding but
5664000	5666000	It's neat that they bring back I remember we were talking about that
5666000	5668000	When they first announced that they were doing that
5668000	5670000	I mean I
5670000	5672000	I never really liked the original Descent
5672000	5674000	I had like the demo for it it came out like one of those PC gamer
5674000	5676000	Discs or something like that
5676000	5678000	Back when they used to do that I don't know if they still
5678000	5680000	Do those but
5680000	5682000	I don't know I just never really got
5682000	5684000	It was hard enough for me to control like
5684000	5686000	First person shooters let alone a
5686000	5688000	360 first person shooter
5688000	5690000	But
5690000	5692000	I never played the original
5692000	5694000	I never heard of the game so
5694000	5696000	I mean if there's a demo I'll
5696000	5698000	Check it out but other than that
5698000	5700000	Probably not cause is it kinda like a
5700000	5702000	Like a Star Fox type
5702000	5704000	I wouldn't really call it Star Fox like imagine if
5704000	5706000	Star Fox was Doom
5706000	5708000	Kinda a little more like that it's a little more realistic
5708000	5710000	I suppose than talking animals
5710000	5712000	Well no I'm not I just mean in terms of like
5712000	5714000	It's a flying shooting game
5714000	5716000	Yeah but you move like you might wanna go to a room
5716000	5718000	That's above you so you actually fly up
5718000	5720000	Where as like Star Fox was still kinda
5720000	5722000	Like on rails a bit
5722000	5724000	You know what I mean like this gives you the full
5724000	5726000	360 degrees of motion
5726000	5728000	So I mean it'll probably be like a very kinda
5728000	5730000	Competent space shooter game
5730000	5732000	Multiplayer was a lot of fun though I will say that
5732000	5734000	Because that was also the day when you know
5734000	5736000	Modems and BBS's you'd hook up through that
5736000	5738000	And you could play like 4 player Doom online
5738000	5740000	Or Duke Nukem
5740000	5742000	And that was a lot of fun too because you could
5742000	5744000	Hide above somebody
5744000	5746000	In a game like Descent so it might be neat
5746000	5748000	We'll see anyway uh
5748000	5750000	Let's move on to the classic game of the week you know
5750000	5752000	One of these weeks we'll have to do Descent
5752000	5754000	As the classic game of the week but I don't think
5754000	5756000	That is what Dark Soccer has in store
5756000	5758000	For us this week let's go ask
5758000	5760000	Jamie Summers what the classic game of the week this week
5760000	5762000	Will be
5762000	5764000	So we take a
5764000	5766000	Step back in time
5766000	5768000	Figuratively and literally
5768000	5770000	In the classic game of the week
5770000	5772000	Where Dark Soccer is here
5772000	5774000	It's magic you just appeared
5774000	5776000	Delvin disappeared and you appeared
5776000	5778000	Oh my god where did Delvin go
5778000	5780000	Well through the magic of space and time
5780000	5782000	He's actually not here yet
5782000	5784000	Right he gets to see me
5784000	5786000	As a nun but yet he's there I know
5786000	5788000	It's going to be a very exciting weekend anyway
5788000	5790000	Let's continue this exciting weekend
5790000	5792000	By talking about actually it's going to be way more exciting
5792000	5794000	For us because we're going to Reno
5794000	5796000	That's where the nuns go I saw that Whoopi
5796000	5798000	Goldberg movie Sister Act
5798000	5800000	Reno and Gamora
5800000	5802000	Nuns in Reno are nuns
5802000	5804000	Alright anyway
5804000	5806000	Girl
5806000	5808000	It's the classic game of the week Dark Soccer
5808000	5810000	Is going to take a trip back and walk into the vault
5810000	5812000	And find a game that she thinks hey
5812000	5814000	You should get to church
5814000	5816000	Or play this game
5816000	5818000	Or cry like the poor Oppa Oppa
5818000	5820000	Or I will slap you with a ruler like nuns do
5820000	5822000	Alright it's the classic game of the week
5822000	5824000	Dark Soccer what did you pick for us
5824000	5826000	Actually did you know you want a fun fact
5826000	5828000	Before we get into tonight's classic game of the week
5828000	5830000	Fun fact for the listeners
5830000	5832000	So we were having dinner earlier this evening
5832000	5834000	As people do sometimes
5834000	5836000	Dark Soccer and I went on a date
5836000	5838000	So Delvin was there too so it was a triad date
5838000	5840000	But anyway we were eating and we were
5840000	5842000	Talking about this segment the classic game of the week
5842000	5844000	And we were wondering how long is it
5844000	5846000	Until the classic game of the week
5846000	5848000	Can be the classic game of the week
5848000	5850000	Like is this segment so thanks to the
5850000	5852000	Wonderful people that maintain the wiki
5852000	5854000	I went back to the wiki and found out
5854000	5856000	This week October 7th
5856000	5858000	2007
5858000	5860000	Was the first classic game of the week
5860000	5862000	So it's actually 11 years old
5862000	5864000	This week
5864000	5866000	So I'm doing the classic game of the week as the classic game of the week
5866000	5868000	I'm kidding I'm not
5868000	5870000	Do you know what the very first classic game of the week ever was that we did
5870000	5872000	I believe it was Fantasy Zone
5872000	5874000	It was Fantasy Zone
5874000	5876000	So tonight for our 11th anniversary spectacular
5876000	5878000	We're doing a sequel
5878000	5880000	That's Fantasy Zone 1-1
5880000	5882000	We're doing Fantasy Zone 2
5882000	5884000	The Tears of Oppa Oppa
5884000	5886000	Oh it's not Electric Boogaloo?
5886000	5888000	Or as it was called Oppa Oppa
5888000	5890000	Non Amida
5890000	5892000	Which basically means Oppa Oppa Tears
5892000	5894000	And I'm actually kind of doing 2 and 1
5894000	5896000	Because I wanted to do the System 16 remake
5896000	5898000	But to do that I have to talk
5898000	5900000	About the Sega Master System
5900000	5902000	Which this is one of the few
5902000	5904000	Times where the game has come out at home
5904000	5906000	And then years later they remade it
5906000	5908000	For the arcade
5908000	5910000	There's a lot of situations where that's happened
5910000	5912000	I mean maybe things like Street Fighter V
5912000	5914000	Question mark
5914000	5916000	Maybe
5916000	5918000	In modern times that really doesn't happen
5918000	5920000	Well at any rate
5920000	5922000	This was a Sega Master System game
5922000	5924000	That came out in 1987
5924000	5926000	Of course it was a Sega game
5926000	5928000	It was ported to the arcade
5928000	5930000	Ported to the arcade
5930000	5932000	Famicom and MSX
5932000	5934000	And then there was a remake
5934000	5936000	For System 16 hardware
5936000	5938000	population in 2008
5938000	5940000	It had virtual console releases
5940000	5942000	But we're going to
5942000	5944000	Go a little bit more
5944000	5946000	Into what this game is like
5946000	5948000	So Fantasy Zone 2 does play
5948000	5950000	Like the first Fantasy Zone
5950000	5952000	Where it's defender style
5952000	5954000	You have a continuously scrolling screen
5954000	5956000	You can go back and forth
5956000	5958000	And shoot down little bases
5958000	5960000	And it does qualify as a shooter
5960000	5962000	Not really fond of that term
5962000	5964000	But anyway
5964000	5966000	Now this game has such a fucking
5966000	5968000	Convoluted storyline
5968000	5970000	Oh my god Rob it has like three endings
5970000	5972000	People play this game for the story?
5972000	5974000	One of the endings
5974000	5976000	Spoiler
5976000	5978000	I play it because it's a cute shooter
5978000	5980000	Oh my god you're going to spoil a 30 year old game
5980000	5982000	Opa Opa turns evil
5982000	5984000	And kills the space Harrier
5984000	5986000	Opa Opa loses to his evil self
5986000	5988000	Evil self takes over
5988000	5990000	And the space Harrier
5990000	5992000	Which you know is set in the same universe right?
5992000	5994000	Opa Opa tries to go to knock his ass out
5994000	5996000	And Opa Opa kills him
5996000	5998000	Funny enough that was also the ending
5998000	6000000	I'm sorry to spoil this guys
6000000	6002000	But that's also the ending to A Star is Born
6002000	6004000	Is that Gaga turns evil
6004000	6006000	And turns into the evil leader of the planet
6006000	6008000	And makes everybody bow down and say
6008000	6010000	Yes Gaga yes
6010000	6012000	That's basically what it is
6012000	6014000	And then she interrupts my Fantasy Zone music
6014000	6016000	And then Changela comes out of the box
6016000	6018000	Yes Hallelu
6018000	6020000	Anyway
6020000	6022000	So basically the story of this
6022000	6024000	Is in the year 1432
6024000	6026000	Space year 1432
6026000	6028000	Ten years after
6028000	6030000	Ten years after
6030000	6032000	Fantasy Zone
6032000	6034000	Opa Opa has to go in
6034000	6036000	And save the Fantasy Zone again
6036000	6038000	So the mastermind of this
6038000	6040000	Is an evil version of himself
6040000	6042000	And then after winning
6042000	6044000	God Smooshy what?
6044000	6046000	Can we hear him?
6046000	6048000	I don't think he picks up on the mic
6048000	6050000	Mr. Smoosh is throwing a fit
6050000	6052000	He's screaming
6052000	6054000	Anyway Opa Opa's father comes out to
6054000	6056000	Comfort him
6056000	6058000	And Opa Opa cries
6058000	6060000	And so the evil Opa Opa vanishes
6060000	6062000	Mr. Smoosh is just playing along
6062000	6064000	And he's singing along
6064000	6066000	But you get to see Opa Opa's daddy
6066000	6068000	Which is a big ginormous Opa Opa
6068000	6070000	Alright well Mr. Smoosh's daddy is going to go over there and tell him to shut the fuck up
6070000	6072000	I'll be back
6072000	6074000	So anyway as I said
6074000	6076000	You play kind of Defender Style
6076000	6078000	Indefinitely
6078000	6080000	And you can travel freely
6080000	6082000	You've got different bases that you have to knock down
6082000	6084000	And you pick up coins
6084000	6086000	And you can go into secret shops to buy stuff
6086000	6088000	But now what's new in this one
6088000	6090000	Is that you get different warps that are hidden behind
6090000	6092000	Certain bases that let you travel to different zones
6092000	6094000	So you have three different zones
6094000	6096000	And when all of the bases have
6096000	6098000	disappeared and all three of the zones
6098000	6100000	Are available
6100000	6102000	Then you can go through a warp to get to the boss
6102000	6104000	Now the boss fights are just simply
6104000	6106000	Like the way that they were in fantasy zones
6106000	6108000	Where you have to kind of be
6108000	6110000	Sort of bullet hellish
6110000	6112000	You know shooting at big bossy things
6112000	6114000	And then
6114000	6116000	They are super huge and they change color
6116000	6118000	And then your last stage is a boss rush
6118000	6120000	Which is kind of a pain in the ass
6120000	6122000	So you get different types of attacks
6122000	6124000	You have a fire and you have a bomb
6124000	6126000	The bomb kind of drops
6126000	6128000	Like in an arc
6128000	6130000	But it is more powerful and has a shorter range
6130000	6132000	You get the shops like I said
6132000	6134000	You can get different weapons
6134000	6136000	Bombs, speeds, extra lives
6136000	6138000	You get the large wing
6138000	6140000	And the jet engine
6140000	6142000	The large one is probably one of my favorite ones
6142000	6144000	So the ones that upgrade
6144000	6146000	Over open speed are permanent
6146000	6148000	As long as you do not die
6148000	6150000	Weapon upgrades are time limited
6150000	6152000	And the bombs have a limited number
6152000	6154000	So here's where we get to the fun part
6154000	6156000	All the ports
6156000	6158000	So it passes into our cave
6158000	6160000	The first one is based on system A
6160000	6162000	So it is almost identical to master system version
6164000	6166000	It does have the radar that shows
6166000	6168000	The base of the destroyer pod
6168000	6170000	And of course
6170000	6172000	It has a timer because
6172000	6174000	Pretty much kind of like
6174000	6176000	Like those play choice games I guess
6176000	6178000	The internet
6178000	6180000	The Famicom version
6180000	6182000	That came out actually has
6182000	6184000	A kind of different name
6184000	6186000	It's called the teardrop of Oppa Oppa
6186000	6188000	So now we have the big one
6188000	6190000	Which really is the one that I wanted to talk about
6190000	6192000	So now keep in mind
6192000	6194000	The first one came out
6194000	6196000	In what did I say
6196000	6198000	2000 not 2000
6198000	6200000	1987 right
6200000	6202000	So in 2008
6202000	6204000	So 10 years ago
6204000	6206000	They
6206000	6208000	Re-released the game
6208000	6210000	They did it in the system 16
6210000	6212000	Which is
6212000	6214000	Basically the
6214000	6216000	Same original hardware
6216000	6218000	It was
6218000	6220000	It was developed by M2
6220000	6222000	And it's not really
6222000	6224000	They didn't want to modernize the older one
6224000	6226000	They wanted to do a hypothetical interpretation
6226000	6228000	Of what the game would have been like
6228000	6230000	Had it been developed for
6230000	6232000	System 16 arcade hardware
6232000	6234000	By the original staff
6234000	6236000	That's kind of neat though
6236000	6238000	It is
6238000	6240000	So instead of using the Sega console
6240000	6242000	R&D system
6242000	6244000	And system E board for the system 16
6244000	6246000	It was called a what if remake
6246000	6248000	And basically it adhered
6248000	6250000	Strictly to the limitations
6250000	6252000	From the time that fantasy M2
6252000	6254000	Was originally released
6254000	6256000	But with the arcade hardware
6256000	6258000	At that point
6258000	6260000	So M2 developed it on a real
6260000	6262000	System 16 hardware
6262000	6264000	Except that it had expanded memory
6264000	6266000	256 kilobytes
6266000	6268000	So it was called
6268000	6270000	They dubbed it system 16c
6270000	6272000	Well I mean that was pretty hot shit for
6272000	6274000	No yeah for that time
6274000	6276000	Now it's just funny like 256 kilobytes
6276000	6278000	It's like I have word documents
6278000	6280000	That are far bigger than that you know
6280000	6282000	It's crazy
6282000	6284000	On top of that it actually can be played
6284000	6286000	Via emulation
6286000	6288000	And on top of that it shows a 1987
6288000	6290000	Sega copyright and makes no mention
6290000	6292000	Of M2
6292000	6294000	So it really
6294000	6296000	And I played the system 16 arcade remake
6296000	6298000	I played it at
6298000	6300000	California extreme
6300000	6302000	I played the shit out of it at California
6302000	6304000	Extreme cause I fucking love some Fantasy Zone
6304000	6306000	And when I first looked at it
6306000	6308000	If I hadn't seen it say the tears of
6308000	6310000	Oppa Oppa I would have thought I was
6310000	6312000	About to play the real Fantasy Zone
6312000	6314000	And I was like oh wait shit this is
6314000	6316000	That one
6316000	6318000	So it's been nicknamed by fans
6318000	6320000	Fantasy Zone 2DX
6320000	6322000	Nice
6322000	6324000	So it follows the original one
6324000	6326000	Kinda loosely it has the enemies
6326000	6328000	Music locations and gameplay from
6328000	6330000	Master System game that has
6330000	6332000	New content and elements that went
6332000	6334000	With the original Fantasy Zone it's actually kinda why I like
6334000	6336000	This one better cause it's more like the original Fantasy Zone
6336000	6338000	So level structure is the
6338000	6340000	Same so instead of distinct zones that you
6340000	6342000	Have to beat you actually have portals
6342000	6344000	That take you into parallel dimensions
6344000	6346000	You have the bright side and the dark side
6346000	6348000	And they're comparable to the levels
6348000	6350000	Of the first Fantasy Zone
6350000	6352000	So you can destroy them in each dimension
6352000	6354000	Jeez okay
6354000	6356000	So bases
6356000	6358000	That are destroyed in one dimension will be destroyed in the other
6358000	6360000	So you can clear entirely on one level
6360000	6362000	Of the other but the dark side is more
6362000	6364000	Difficult but you get greater rewards
6364000	6366000	And points and money
6366000	6368000	The bosses are the same on either side
6368000	6370000	But they have a more difficult
6370000	6372000	Attack pattern on the dark side
6372000	6374000	It also has three endings
6374000	6376000	Based on which
6376000	6378000	On both whether the dark side levels
6378000	6380000	Were cleared and whether certain specific
6380000	6382000	Items were purchased so that's where
6382000	6384000	You get like the you know daddy comes
6384000	6386000	And helps Oppa Oppa
6386000	6388000	And then evil Oppa Oppa
6388000	6390000	Takes over and there's like one more
6390000	6392000	The music was done by
6392000	6394000	Manabu Namiki
6394000	6396000	Sorry Manabu Namiki
6396000	6398000	That uses
6398000	6400000	Some of the songs from
6400000	6402000	The original Fantasy Zone 2 soundtrack
6402000	6404000	But rearranged to fit more
6404000	6406000	Like Kawaguchi Hiroshi's
6406000	6408000	First Fantasy Zone style so
6408000	6410000	And there's a few original tracks
6410000	6412000	That were made for it
6412000	6414000	It's based off of some of the same
6414000	6416000	Games
6416000	6418000	The
6418000	6420000	Bosses there are some new ones for here
6420000	6422000	It's just sort of like again a loose interpretation
6422000	6424000	It's kind of like arena
6424000	6426000	So it has been bootlegged and re-released
6426000	6428000	To the arcades
6428000	6430000	As FZ-2006-2
6430000	6432000	By a Taiwanese manufacturer
6432000	6434000	Called ISG
6434000	6436000	As a 2006 copyright date
6436000	6438000	But it's directly
6438000	6440000	Derived from the Playstation 2 release
6440000	6442000	It also has the ROM data
6442000	6444000	From the PS2 version
6444000	6446000	Sega did
6446000	6448000	Actually produce
6448000	6450000	Real arcade units running the System 16
6450000	6452000	Hardware as part of the promotion
6452000	6454000	So there's a Nintendo 3DS
6454000	6456000	Port of this version
6456000	6458000	16-bit version that came out in Japan
6458000	6460000	In 2014 and internationally
6460000	6462000	In 2015 and it's called 3D Fantasy
6462000	6464000	Zone 2W
6464000	6466000	You also have
6466000	6468000	Another game mode in this one
6468000	6470000	It's called Loop Land
6470000	6472000	Where it's an endless survival mode
6472000	6474000	Starring Oppa Oppa's brother Oppa Oppa
6476000	6478000	Oppa Oppa and Oppa Oppa
6478000	6480000	Oppa Oppa and Oppa Oppa
6480000	6482000	Oppa Oppa
6482000	6484000	I just always laugh at Oppa Oppa
6484000	6486000	Because I don't know if his name is supposed to be a ton on boobs
6486000	6488000	Oppai
6488000	6490000	Or if it's like Oppa
6490000	6492000	You know the Greek cheer
6492000	6494000	I think it's also a Korean word for brother
6494000	6496000	Because I used to have a friend in high school
6496000	6498000	Random question
6498000	6500000	So there you go
6500000	6502000	It is one of the best games
6502000	6504000	Ever made Fantasy Zone 2
6504000	6506000	And as much
6506000	6508000	As much as I
6508000	6510000	I have a lot of fucking love for this game
6510000	6512000	And if someone wants to find me
6512000	6514000	The Sega Ages Fantasy Zone box
6514000	6516000	Will work something out
6516000	6518000	Alright
6518000	6520000	She'll go Oppa Oppa for it
6520000	6522000	Also
6522000	6524000	I'm mad because Dan guessed
6524000	6526000	One of the games I got him
6526000	6528000	And I can't lie
6528000	6530000	He guessed that I got him the treasure box
6530000	6532000	So when is his birthday?
6532000	6534000	It's November 29th
6534000	6536000	Oh gosh so are you making him wait?
6536000	6538000	I'm making him wait
6538000	6540000	That's what he gets
6540000	6542000	Guess what he got though for us?
6542000	6544000	On the 27th he got us tickets to see the
6544000	6546000	40th anniversary
6546000	6548000	Theater showing a superman
6548000	6550000	That's kind of cool
6550000	6552000	Very cool
6552000	6554000	Last game of the week Fantasy Zone 2
6554000	6556000	The Tears of Oppa Oppa
6556000	6558000	Poor Oppa Oppa don't cry
6558000	6560000	We're running long so we gotta wrap up
6560000	6562000	So any last words for the week Dark Sakura?
6562000	6564000	I like big butts
6564000	6566000	And I cannot lie
6566000	6568000	You other brothers can't deny
6568000	6570000	I'm kidding
6570000	6572000	I don't like big butts
6572000	6574000	Unless they're like rump roasts
6574000	6576000	I'm done
6582000	6584000	And we're back in the present
6584000	6586000	Where sadly Dark Sakura did not
6586000	6588000	end up coming out as a nun
6588000	6590000	Delvin didn't get to see that because unfortunately
6590000	6592000	I think she got a little sick before
6592000	6594000	we went out last night
6594000	6596000	I was taking Delvin around
6596000	6598000	I'm trying to think of how to give Delvin this Sacramento
6598000	6600000	experience because we don't exactly have
6600000	6602000	a lot. It's not like Disneyland
6602000	6604000	is in this part of California
6604000	6606000	Disneyland is like six hours
6606000	6608000	from here. It's a long way away
6608000	6610000	It's pretty far
6610000	6612000	So I was like well we'll go to Old Town
6612000	6614000	That'll be fun
6614000	6616000	We'll go to the Capitol
6616000	6618000	I actually taught Delvin a little bit about
6618000	6620000	American government today
6620000	6622000	Which is very confusing by the way
6622000	6624000	Especially if you've watched the news this past week
6624000	6626000	You're especially looking at it going
6626000	6628000	How did any of this happen?
6628000	6630000	It's so confusing
6630000	6632000	US politics is just very confusing
6632000	6634000	Canadian politics which I feel is a little bit more
6634000	6636000	simplistic in its design
6636000	6638000	But ask any of us to explain
6638000	6640000	Canadian politics and we couldn't do it
6640000	6642000	I doubt I barely could
6642000	6644000	I would bet there would be so many Americans that would be like
6644000	6646000	Justin Trudeau is the president of Canada, right?
6646000	6648000	Probably
6648000	6650000	Well, no
6650000	6652000	Prime Minister, but close
6652000	6654000	Close, as far as
6654000	6656000	delegations
6656000	6658000	It's got to be equivalent, but it's not the same
6658000	6660000	Anyway
6660000	6662000	To register participation for this
6662000	6664000	week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at
6664000	6666000	vognetwork.com, use the passphrase
6666000	6668000	Family
6668000	6670000	Speaking of like adventures and
6670000	6672000	being here in Sacramento
6672000	6674000	So you've listened to OLR sometimes
6674000	6676000	And now you're here, what should people at home
6676000	6678000	know about what
6678000	6680000	OLR is really like in person?
6680000	6682000	It's just what it sounds like
6682000	6684000	That's good
6684000	6686000	I guess that's good, that means we're authentic
6686000	6688000	That's good, alright, it's an authentic product
6688000	6690000	I appreciate that
6690000	6692000	Good, alright
6692000	6694000	And you're even getting to sit in Jamie's chair
6694000	6696000	I feel very special
6696000	6698000	It's the nicest chair in the room, isn't it?
6698000	6700000	That's why I picked it
6700000	6702000	Nothing but the finest for our out of town guests
6702000	6704000	Alright, looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com
6704000	6706000	SSG100Matt says
6706000	6708000	I thought the Sacramento experience was watching
6708000	6710000	Lady Bird
6710000	6712000	You know, as
6712000	6714000	somebody who's lived here his entire life
6714000	6716000	I did watch that movie and I was
6716000	6718000	obviously I nitpicked some of the
6718000	6720000	little things, but I was like, yeah
6720000	6722000	honestly, they got it
6722000	6724000	They
6724000	6726000	really got it, and like the whole story
6726000	6728000	of her really spoke to me
6728000	6730000	because I too applied to go to college
6730000	6732000	back east, it's just
6732000	6734000	I didn't get in
6734000	6736000	Aww
6736000	6738000	My life turned out okay, it's all good
6738000	6740000	I also learned in college that college
6740000	6742000	wasn't for me, and that's what happens
6742000	6744000	sometimes, college isn't for everybody, so
6744000	6746000	Sometimes I just don't think people should go
6746000	6748000	college right after high school
6748000	6750000	I think that is, well that's a
6750000	6752000	big reason why community college is a thing
6752000	6754000	because, and some people have joked and called
6754000	6756000	community college 13th grade, but
6756000	6758000	actually I think it really is like a good
6758000	6760000	transition type of thing, so I think
6760000	6762000	community college is really underrated in
6762000	6764000	many ways, but anyway, it is not that kind of
6764000	6766000	show, although I
6766000	6768000	do associate, you know what I associate community college
6768000	6770000	with? The altered beast machine
6770000	6772000	that was at the cafeteria at the community college
6772000	6774000	I went to and took like one or two
6774000	6776000	classes at during the summer, they
6776000	6778000	had an altered beast machine, it was awesome
6778000	6780000	There you go
6780000	6782000	What? What?
6782000	6784000	I guess I live a primitive life up in Canada
6784000	6786000	Apparently, my god, you
6786000	6788000	really do all live in igloos with no power
6788000	6790000	don't you
6790000	6792000	Alright
6792000	6794000	Alright, let's move on, let's get into some
6794000	6796000	rapid fire news, Loki
6796000	6798000	So there's more rumors regarding
6798000	6800000	Microsoft releasing
6800000	6802000	a streaming platform
6802000	6804000	as a new console possibly
6804000	6806000	next year, they're
6806000	6808000	saying that
6808000	6810000	the rumors are that this
6810000	6812000	console quality game
6812000	6814000	streaming platform for phones and other
6814000	6816000	devices will be released
6816000	6818000	sometime as early as
6818000	6820000	quarter one of, or quarter two
6820000	6822000	of next year, and
6822000	6824000	they're saying that there's possibly going to be an
6824000	6826000	announcement at EXO
6826000	6828000	2018 in November
6828000	6830000	So I guess we'll have to
6830000	6832000	wait and see if that actually
6832000	6834000	ends up being a thing
6834000	6836000	They don't really have a streaming
6836000	6838000	platform
6838000	6840000	I feel like it's not a void they really need to
6840000	6842000	fill, because they have game pass
6842000	6844000	which is pretty rad, but
6844000	6846000	okay, I mean if they
6846000	6848000	But what if you could do game pass on devices that
6848000	6850000	if you don't have an Xbox
6850000	6852000	Yeah, I think that's the direction
6852000	6854000	Microsoft, and we've heard this rumor before
6854000	6856000	that the next Xbox
6856000	6858000	is there's going to be one super
6858000	6860000	Xbox, but then there's going to be a baby
6860000	6862000	Xbox that just basically does the online
6862000	6864000	Yeah, so I
6864000	6866000	one of the things that I think the direction
6866000	6868000	Microsoft is going, and probably
6868000	6870000	all consoles will be going in the future
6870000	6872000	is no longer having us
6872000	6874000	like a new generation
6874000	6876000	and then creating a segmented
6876000	6878000	user base, so
6878000	6880000	I think that they're planning to have
6880000	6882000	whatever next console Microsoft
6882000	6884000	comes out with the more powerful
6884000	6886000	and whatever the case may be, but those games
6886000	6888000	that come out for it will work on your
6888000	6890000	original Xbox, but will scale
6890000	6892000	in the same way that you
6892000	6894000	buy a PC game, and even if you
6894000	6896000	are playing it on your laptop with
6896000	6898000	no video card, it will still work
6898000	6900000	or just like
6900000	6902000	you have Pokemon Go
6902000	6904000	on your iPhone, and it will work
6904000	6906000	on your iPhone 5, 6
6906000	6908000	7, 8, it doesn't matter
6908000	6910000	it just scales correctly, so
6910000	6912000	this streaming method
6912000	6914000	might be one of the ways in which they
6914000	6916000	allow those more powerful games to
6916000	6918000	run on the older systems, you just
6918000	6920000	stream it. Well you know a story that didn't
6920000	6922000	make our show roll tonight has to do with the fact that
6922000	6924000	the Switch is exploiting, like Capcom's
6924000	6926000	looking at doing something like
6926000	6928000	Resident Evil 7 with maybe
6928000	6930000	more of their games, because you may or may not
6930000	6932000	know, but in Japan, there's more of these
6932000	6934000	streaming games on the Switch, and that's how
6934000	6936000	they've put Resident Evil 7 on it
6936000	6938000	and Assassin's Creed Odyssey came out
6938000	6940000	on the Switch in Japan. And Phantasy Star Online
6940000	6942000	2. Oh that's right!
6942000	6944000	Is a streaming
6944000	6946000	stream game. God that pisses me off.
6946000	6948000	That's not open, that can of worms.
6948000	6950000	I want to play that game so bad,
6950000	6952000	and they just refuse to release it in the US.
6952000	6954000	Sega, what's your fucking problem?
6954000	6956000	Like seriously.
6956000	6958000	I have so much fond memories of that
6958000	6960000	game, but I just want to play the second one
6960000	6962000	so bad. Same.
6962000	6964000	Anyway, sorry Logi.
6964000	6966000	So, I think
6966000	6968000	it's a neat idea on paper, but
6968000	6970000	like, you know, are
6970000	6972000	the United, you know,
6972000	6974000	North American
6974000	6976000	internet infrastructures
6976000	6978000	going to be able to handle something like this?
6978000	6980000	I don't, I'm
6980000	6982000	kind of concerned that, no,
6982000	6984000	they can't. I
6984000	6986000	would, well, okay, but remember
6986000	6988000	we live in Sacramento, and
6988000	6990000	one of the things that we're getting here, that
6990000	6992000	very few cities in America are getting because we're in
6992000	6994000	a test program, they just rolled out 5G here.
6994000	6996000	Now sadly, not where OLR Studios
6996000	6998000	is located, because this is in the downtown
6998000	7000000	part, and I'm not going to give out my address on
7000000	7002000	air, but I don't live downtown.
7002000	7004000	So, the downtown area is really
7004000	7006000	where a lot of this is going in, because they put all the
7006000	7008000	boxes on phone poles. So, I mean, 5G
7008000	7010000	is going to give you wirelessly
7010000	7012000	like what cable internet gives
7012000	7014000	you. So,
7014000	7016000	here's the thing, in five years from now,
7016000	7018000	Logi, the internet like that is only
7018000	7020000	going to get better, and 5G is going to roll out more
7020000	7022000	and more places. Will places like
7022000	7024000	rural Alaska
7024000	7026000	have that type of internet? Probably
7026000	7028000	not, but you know what?
7028000	7030000	I mean, they
7030000	7032000	were probably still on dial-up
7032000	7034000	up to a few years ago, but it's progressed.
7034000	7036000	It's not so much the speeds. I mean,
7036000	7038000	speeds definitely, we need improvements
7038000	7040000	there, but it's also bandwidth caps
7040000	7042000	for no fucking reason.
7042000	7044000	Well, I kind of think
7044000	7046000	that argument is going to have to
7046000	7048000	give a little bit as more and
7048000	7050000	more people start getting too close to
7050000	7052000	that cap, but cable is really
7052000	7054000	probably assessing the situation right now. Like, a
7054000	7056000	company like Comcast is
7056000	7058000	definitely going. Like, the days
7058000	7060000	of cable as a television
7060000	7062000	delivery service are limited. Like,
7062000	7064000	that is dying. You know,
7064000	7066000	again, maybe in rural parts
7066000	7068000	where there isn't as fast of internet and so forth,
7068000	7070000	maybe there's still a need there, but
7070000	7072000	again, a lot of those people have had satellite
7072000	7074000	for the longest time. But, you know, people,
7074000	7076000	more and more people are ditching cable
7076000	7078000	channels to watch their shows on
7078000	7080000	Netflix, or this is why
7080000	7082000	as much as people hate on CBS
7082000	7084000	All Access, it exists
7084000	7086000	because CBS saw this coming a long
7086000	7088000	time ago. So, they were trying to
7088000	7090000	future-proof against, you know what?
7090000	7092000	People aren't going to be getting CBS on cable.
7092000	7094000	They're not going to be getting it over the air.
7094000	7096000	So, we need to, you know, adopt
7096000	7098000	this Netflix-style thing, like, fast
7098000	7100000	because that is where it's going.
7100000	7102000	So, one of the things I
7102000	7104000	have noticed recently
7104000	7106000	in terms of infrastructure
7106000	7108000	and internet and TV and all that sort of thing,
7108000	7110000	all the,
7110000	7112000	in Canada, the providers now,
7112000	7114000	all the internet plans don't
7114000	7116000	have, most of them don't have caps anymore.
7116000	7118000	They're all just unlimited.
7118000	7120000	They just limit the speed at which you get
7120000	7122000	the internet now. Oh, hooray. Another reason
7122000	7124000	why Canada is better than the United States.
7124000	7126000	Like, as if everything.
7126000	7128000	Why can't we just live in Canada? I mean,
7128000	7130000	seriously. You can if you want to.
7130000	7132000	It's a bit of a process. Actually, do you know, I was like,
7132000	7134000	do you know how hard it is for an American to be going to Canada?
7134000	7136000	Because, you know, there's a lot of people this week
7136000	7138000	that are like, I'm going to move to Canada because fuck
7138000	7140000	this place. And, you know what?
7140000	7142000	I completely understand
7142000	7144000	that as a reaction. But when you
7144000	7146000	sit down and you really start to plot
7146000	7148000	it out, you're like, oh shit, that's really hard
7148000	7150000	to do. It's complicated. And
7150000	7152000	it's also one of those things, and I
7152000	7154000	don't want to get political, but it's also one of those where I also
7154000	7156000	kind of feel like, no, this is my fucking
7156000	7158000	country too. And we are going
7158000	7160000	to fucking fix this problem.
7160000	7162000	So that's also my kind of perspective, but that's my
7162000	7164000	I will get on that high horse at a later time.
7164000	7166000	So anyway. But anyway, so
7166000	7168000	the, uh, most of the plans are
7168000	7170000	trending towards no cap. So that's
7170000	7172000	one issue for this streaming service gone
7172000	7174000	out the window. Um,
7174000	7176000	the major issue will be the
7176000	7178000	cap, or so not the cap, the
7178000	7180000	bandwidth or rate at which you can
7180000	7182000	download it and upload. Because
7182000	7184000	if you don't have good up download, then you're screwed for the
7184000	7186000	streaming service. But I think it's more something
7186000	7188000	that is going to be as a premium service. So it's not
7188000	7190000	meant to be for,
7190000	7192000	you know, Tom in Alaska, who's,
7192000	7194000	you know, he needs to actually
7194000	7196000	purchase the game in order to play it.
7196000	7198000	He can't stream it. Which could easily be said
7198000	7200000	to for people north of you in Canada,
7200000	7202000	because there's a lot of, a lot of place
7202000	7204000	in Canada that probably don't have these fast Internet's.
7204000	7206000	Yeah, very, very true. Um, and
7206000	7208000	one of the things like you mentioned with the TV,
7208000	7210000	um, so one of the, uh,
7210000	7212000	television, major television providers,
7212000	7214000	CTV, uh, in
7214000	7216000	Canada did their promos
7216000	7218000	in all the subway stations for,
7218000	7220000	you know, the fall lineup and stuff.
7220000	7222000	Normally they'll say, oh, this
7222000	7224000	show is airing, uh,
7224000	7226000	you know, Thursdays at nine.
7226000	7228000	Uh, one of the key
7228000	7230000	things I noticed that they did, uh,
7230000	7232000	in their advertising is they said it is
7232000	7234000	now streaming at
7234000	7236000	such and such a time. Yeah.
7236000	7238000	They, they emphasize that
7238000	7240000	it's not something
7240000	7242000	that's live. It's available for
7242000	7244000	streaming at this time and this
7244000	7246000	date. Yeah. So again, trending in
7246000	7248000	the direction of you just now are just going to
7248000	7250000	get everything on the Internet. Yeah.
7250000	7252000	No, it's interesting stuff. It's
7252000	7254000	going to be really interesting to see where we are in the future.
7254000	7256000	I mean, to put it in perspective,
7256000	7258000	one other little tidbit that I think you guys, some of you
7258000	7260000	are going to find funny. When OLR
7260000	7262000	first started in 2002,
7262000	7264000	this was before VOG Network
7264000	7266000	was a thing. This was before All Games Radio
7266000	7268000	where we were at previously was a thing.
7268000	7270000	When OLR was a
7270000	7272000	station where this show was
7272000	7274000	the kind of centerpiece of the station,
7274000	7276000	that's what it was originally intended.
7276000	7278000	One of the pitches of our station
7278000	7280000	because we were kind of, and I'm using my quoting fingers,
7280000	7282000	competing with DDR
7282000	7284000	Freak Radio, but we really weren't.
7284000	7286000	Like we were two peas in a pod, right?
7286000	7288000	But our thing was
7288000	7290000	where as DDR Freak Radio was all high
7290000	7292000	speed, we were dial-up friendly
7292000	7294000	radio when we started.
7294000	7296000	So something to think about. When this show started,
7296000	7298000	there was still enough need out there
7298000	7300000	for there to be dial-up friendly streams
7300000	7302000	that you could listen to. And
7302000	7304000	there's a reason why I'm called Potato
7304000	7306000	because this show sounded like a Potato
7306000	7308000	if you go back to episode one, because it's saved
7308000	7310000	in that dial-up quality. But that's the
7310000	7312000	reality, is that the internet has progressed
7312000	7314000	that much, even since then.
7314000	7316000	And it will continue to progress even
7316000	7318000	faster, even in the next five years.
7318000	7320000	As far as this show is concerned,
7320000	7322000	even in the next three months, because
7322000	7324000	whereas we upgraded from
7324000	7326000	24 kbps,
7326000	7328000	the dial-up standard or whatever it was,
7328000	7330000	to 96, which we're using on VoG,
7330000	7332000	now we're going to be going to Twitch.
7332000	7334000	As more and more people now
7334000	7336000	can just watch video on their phones.
7336000	7338000	This is not something we could have considered doing
7338000	7340000	a few years ago, even.
7340000	7342000	You know what I mean?
7342000	7344000	So, again, with this streaming service, it's kind of
7344000	7346000	just, I guess, them setting the groundwork
7346000	7348000	and infrastructure for something that
7348000	7350000	will be more readily
7350000	7352000	available in five years.
7352000	7354000	Anyway, rapid-fire news, and we just spent
7354000	7356000	probably the longest on that topic, but that's alright.
7356000	7358000	It was good talk.
7358000	7360000	I love how you say sorry.
7360000	7362000	So, PUBG over the last
7362000	7364000	14 months has banned 13 million
7364000	7366000	users.
7366000	7368000	That's one way to get your
7368000	7370000	subscription numbers out. Well, most of
7370000	7372000	the people that were kicked off the service
7372000	7374000	were using cheat tools.
7374000	7376000	And then
7376000	7378000	apparently that's a common problem.
7378000	7380000	Well, I would assume so, if you've kicked off
7380000	7382000	13 million people.
7382000	7384000	They've, of course, been
7384000	7386000	patching the game to fight against these
7386000	7388000	tools, but then there's also
7388000	7390000	aimbots and whatnot.
7390000	7392000	But these were the numbers
7392000	7394000	that were coming out from Bluehole
7394000	7396000	and the Korean
7396000	7398000	PUBG Cafe board.
7398000	7400000	That's an
7400000	7402000	interesting statistic.
7402000	7404000	Yeah.
7404000	7406000	Maybe the rampant
7406000	7408000	cheating is one of the reasons why PUBG
7408000	7410000	has fallen in the rankings. I don't know.
7410000	7412000	But I don't play the game or Fortnite
7412000	7414000	enough to really get into that stan war.
7414000	7416000	So, but it's just, it's interesting
7416000	7418000	they've had to ban that many accounts, and is that really gonna
7418000	7420000	stop them? As Jason said in the intro,
7420000	7422000	one goes down, two more
7422000	7424000	come up, you know? Well, I think one of the things
7424000	7426000	that killed the PUBG
7426000	7428000	userbase was the amount of
7428000	7430000	people that they were banning
7430000	7432000	for stream sniping,
7432000	7434000	quote unquote, but weren't
7434000	7436000	actually stream sniping. Oh.
7436000	7438000	Remember that whole thing? Yeah, I do.
7438000	7440000	That really killed that community. Yeah, that was...
7440000	7442000	And that was right when Fortnite came out.
7442000	7444000	So, people were getting pissed off from one
7444000	7446000	and jumping right to the other. Well, but then the
7446000	7448000	other big thing was that Fortnite's Battle Royale
7448000	7450000	was free, and PUBG cost money.
7450000	7452000	And I think, honestly, it's really not much
7452000	7454000	more difficult than that.
7454000	7456000	I think for a lot, but you're right, that other
7456000	7458000	situation certainly didn't help. And the quality of
7458000	7460000	the game, it looks like too, like PUBG
7460000	7462000	it's not really as flat.
7462000	7464000	It's kind of like comparing, I guess,
7464000	7466000	like, you know, it's not Overwatch
7466000	7468000	where Overwatch, you know, has
7468000	7470000	this like really flashy
7470000	7472000	art style and everything that, you know,
7472000	7474000	Fortnite has, whereas PUBG's kind of
7474000	7476000	meh. It's
7476000	7478000	serves its purpose. It's trying to go a little more
7478000	7480000	for the realistic angle. Yeah, but...
7480000	7482000	To make success. Yeah, no, I get it.
7482000	7484000	I get it. Alright. Anyhow,
7484000	7486000	let's move on to some other rapid fire news
7486000	7488000	including a game that's several years old
7488000	7490000	at this point, which is interesting because
7490000	7492000	it's a remake of a game that's many years old.
7492000	7494000	But it's one of my favorite classics.
7494000	7496000	The game Shadowgate from the
7496000	7498000	Nintendo Entertainment System. Did you ever play Shadowgate, Delvin?
7498000	7500000	Never heard of it. Oh, and the music is really
7500000	7502000	good. It was like a PC game
7502000	7504000	they kind of put out on the NES.
7504000	7506000	Where, like, you use the
7506000	7508000	controller as a mouse, basically.
7508000	7510000	And, yeah, it's kind of neat. Anyway, they
7510000	7512000	remade it a few years ago and
7512000	7514000	I actually was a Kickstarter backer. It's one of the
7514000	7516000	very few Kickstarters I ever did.
7516000	7518000	But I was like, somebody wants to make a
7518000	7520000	new Shadowgate game? Fuck yes, take my money.
7520000	7522000	Because this was before we really started
7522000	7524000	learning about all the issues with Kickstarter.
7524000	7526000	And, you know what, to be fair, these guys
7526000	7528000	they did the game. They delivered on what
7528000	7530000	they promised. It's out there.
7530000	7532000	So, uh, and they're going to keep it going
7532000	7534000	because this new Shadowgate
7534000	7536000	version is going to be coming to the Nintendo Switch
7536000	7538000	this autumn. So they're putting out
7538000	7540000	the new Shadowgate on the Switch.
7540000	7542000	It is based on the newer PC version
7542000	7544000	that came out a couple years ago, but they're going to enhance it
7544000	7546000	with a new user interface and
7546000	7548000	a wheel-based command system, some other
7548000	7550000	new features and elements as well. So
7550000	7552000	that is pretty cool.
7552000	7554000	Also, speaking of the Nintendo stuff,
7554000	7556000	remember the Switch Online
7556000	7558000	Classic Nintendo library?
7558000	7560000	We knew we were going to be getting more games
7560000	7562000	in October, but we didn't quite know when.
7562000	7564000	Well, now we know. Those new games
7564000	7566000	will be arriving on October 10th.
7566000	7568000	So Super Dodgeball,
7568000	7570000	NES Open Tournament Golf, and
7570000	7572000	Sullivan's Key will be arriving on
7572000	7574000	October 10th. And if I were to rank
7574000	7576000	those, I would say probably Super
7576000	7578000	Dodgeball is going to be the best, especially with the
7578000	7580000	online play. That was a really,
7580000	7582000	uh, it's kind of the art style
7582000	7584000	of River City Ransom, and it has a very
7584000	7586000	particular name in Japan, and somebody
7586000	7588000	in chat will beat me to it. But, um...
7588000	7590000	You needed a multi-tap to play
7590000	7592000	that, because it's four players, wasn't it?
7592000	7594000	I don't think so. You could play two-player.
7594000	7596000	It might have supported the four-player
7596000	7598000	thing, but it was two-player. I think it did.
7598000	7600000	But it was like, imagine the River City Ransom guys are playing
7600000	7602000	Dodgeball, and it was really well done.
7602000	7604000	The definitive version is on the Neo Geo,
7604000	7606000	honestly, but the NES version
7606000	7608000	is not bad. Because they were playing,
7608000	7610000	thinking way back, they were playing
7610000	7612000	this on
7612000	7614000	stage when they were doing the
7614000	7616000	Nintendo World Championships
7616000	7618000	in the Oakland Coliseum.
7618000	7620000	They were playing the four-player version of
7620000	7622000	Dodgeball.
7622000	7624000	I remember when I was trying to do the
7624000	7626000	preliminary
7626000	7628000	trial thing, where you had to play the three games.
7628000	7630000	And then I would rank
7630000	7632000	number two as Solomon's Key.
7632000	7634000	Some people would probably put that in first place,
7634000	7636000	but I think that was a pretty competent puzzler game
7636000	7638000	that was on the NES. And number three,
7638000	7640000	of course, the golf game. Trash.
7640000	7642000	Sorry, just my opinion.
7642000	7644000	It is. It is.
7644000	7646000	Does Nintendo have Nintendo Golf on there already?
7646000	7648000	Uh, the actual NES Golf?
7648000	7650000	No, it is not there.
7650000	7652000	So this is what you're getting instead.
7652000	7654000	Oh, on the NES Classic
7654000	7656000	service, but there wasn't that
7656000	7658000	golf thing that they did, someone
7658000	7660000	Oh, it was, uh, that was
7660000	7662000	the hidden game. The hidden game was golf.
7662000	7664000	That was the Iwata thing that somebody
7664000	7666000	found in there was the original 8-bit
7666000	7668000	NES Golf. That's what you're thinking about.
7668000	7670000	That actually, for some reason, was not
7670000	7672000	put on the Nintendo Classic service, and they're
7672000	7674000	doing this instead, so I don't know.
7674000	7676000	This is a golf game from much later in the NES's life.
7676000	7678000	Oh, it's not that golf game.
7678000	7680000	No, it is not. It's a Mario golf game.
7680000	7682000	It's basically that, but insert Mario.
7682000	7684000	Which, to think about it, if I seem to remember
7684000	7686000	the original guy kind of looked like Mario,
7686000	7688000	but it wasn't officially him.
7688000	7690000	But there's a very different look to this game.
7690000	7692000	So, uh, anyway.
7692000	7694000	D'Artesia said, I assume that we won't
7694000	7696000	get original NES Golf.
7696000	7698000	I don't know. They may still do that at some point.
7698000	7700000	And D'Artesia says, I do
7700000	7702000	remember having Solomon's Key back in the day.
7702000	7704000	Actually, I owned it too, believe it or not.
7704000	7706000	So they're not gonna do the original golf because it's
7706000	7708000	gonna take so much programming stuff
7708000	7710000	for them to get to work. They can't just, like,
7710000	7712000	dump in a ROM or anything like that?
7712000	7714000	We're not doing this again.
7714000	7716000	I'm just checking, because it seems like
7716000	7718000	it's an awful lot of work for Nintendo.
7718000	7720000	Not today, Satan. Delvin is here,
7720000	7722000	and we are going to have
7722000	7724000	a good time, dammit!
7724000	7726000	Alright.
7726000	7728000	Let's move on and talk about what's coming
7728000	7730000	out in stores this week. Loki,
7730000	7732000	what will we be playing a little sooner than
7732000	7734000	NES Golf on the Switch?
7760000	7762000	And then the World Ends With You final
7762000	7764000	remix. Is it really the final remix?
7764000	7766000	Is it really the final one?
7766000	7768000	The final for now. Final for now.
7768000	7770000	Nintendo Switch. It's final, like, as in the
7770000	7772000	Final Fantasy for the
7772000	7774000	Nintendo Switch. And that
7774000	7776000	is what we're getting.
7776000	7778000	Alright, let's travel to Japan. And over
7778000	7780000	in Japan, they're gonna be getting a game called
7780000	7782000	Varnir of the Dragon Star,
7782000	7784000	Exodus of the Dragon
7784000	7786000	that comes out in a regular and limited edition.
7786000	7788000	Middle Earth Shadow of War
7788000	7790000	that's a price reduction in Japan this week as it
7790000	7792000	moves into the definitive edition.
7792000	7794000	Tactical Assault Commander
7794000	7796000	comes out as well, with a variety
7796000	7798000	of different little controllers and things like that.
7798000	7800000	And believe it or not, Call of Duty
7800000	7802000	Black Ops 4, you know, they're going pretty
7802000	7804000	hard in Japan with that as well, so they
7804000	7806000	get a release the same day we do,
7806000	7808000	as well as Europe, so that's all on the same
7808000	7810000	day. So Japan won't miss out on that.
7810000	7812000	But they're actually also getting a blue
7812000	7814000	camouflage dual-shot
7814000	7816000	controller as well. And then
7816000	7818000	there are new PlayStation 4 pros
7818000	7820000	in Glacier White and Jet Black.
7820000	7822000	I don't think these are Call of Duty themed, I think they just
7822000	7824000	happen to be the same day. But there's Glacier White
7824000	7826000	and Jet Black pros with a one terabyte
7826000	7828000	hard drive also coming out that day.
7828000	7830000	And there is also a brand new
7830000	7832000	PlayStation VR bundle in
7832000	7834000	Japan, so kind of
7834000	7836000	setting the stage for end-of-the-year
7836000	7838000	releases. Not really holiday releases in Japan
7838000	7840000	because Christmas isn't quite the same thing
7840000	7842000	that it is here, but I would say
7842000	7844000	end-of-the-year kind of positioning.
7844000	7846000	That is Japan. Dark Soccer
7846000	7848000	is not here for the UK, but maybe you can help out
7848000	7850000	Logie? Sure.
7850000	7852000	So this week we're getting Space Hulk
7852000	7854000	Tactics on PlayStation 4 and
7854000	7856000	Xbox One, WWE 2K19
7856000	7858000	on PC, PlayStation 4
7858000	7860000	and Xbox One. Goosebumps
7860000	7862000	the game on the Switch.
7862000	7864000	They're getting a bridge
7864000	7866000	constructor compilation
7866000	7868000	that's both the bridge
7868000	7870000	constructor portal and the original
7870000	7872000	bridge constructor that's on PlayStation 4.
7872000	7874000	A game called My
7874000	7876000	Riding Stables Life with Horses
7876000	7878000	on PlayStation 4 and the Switch.
7878000	7880000	Call of Duty
7880000	7882000	Black Ops 4 on PlayStation 4
7882000	7884000	Xbox One and PC.
7884000	7886000	And last but not least
7886000	7888000	The World Ends with You final remix on the
7888000	7890000	Switch. Okie dokie.
7890000	7892000	Well before we get back into some news
7892000	7894000	we're going to take some time out to read
7894000	7896000	some of your emails.
7896000	7898000	Every
7898000	7900000	week you guys email us. Participate at
7900000	7902000	OrangeLoungeRadio.com and we read some
7902000	7904000	of those emails live here on the air.
7904000	7906000	Actually we're pretty good about reading them all
7906000	7908000	unless they're just way way
7908000	7910000	way too long or off topic or something like
7910000	7912000	that, but we read them all.
7912000	7914000	You get to be here for a mail bag segment, Delman.
7914000	7916000	Isn't that exciting? Yes. And we actually have some
7916000	7918000	emails tonight. You ready for it? Alright.
7918000	7920000	I should have made you read them. That would have been fun. Alright.
7920000	7922000	Anyway, the first email tonight
7922000	7924000	is from DJ Rama S.
7924000	7926000	I've never heard of this guy. He must be
7926000	7928000	a new listener.
7928000	7930000	Long time listener. First time caller.
7930000	7932000	How about that? Alright. Obviously I'm teasing.
7932000	7934000	We love Rama. So the email
7934000	7936000	goes like this. Evening everyone.
7936000	7938000	I hope all is good. Two weeks ago
7938000	7940000	I tried to call into the show, but I just missed
7940000	7942000	the Skyplinas. I just got off the train.
7942000	7944000	So if you bear with me, I have a few things to say.
7944000	7946000	Number one. Telltale Games.
7946000	7948000	First of all, I feel really bad about
7948000	7950000	the employees losing their jobs like that.
7950000	7952000	It sucks that this seems to be the norm in
7952000	7954000	the industry when it shouldn't be. What
7954000	7956000	bothers me is how upper management surprised
7956000	7958000	everyone about it. How do you go from
7958000	7960000	hiring people to firing people in a week?
7960000	7962000	I really think that upper management
7962000	7964000	has been finageling
7964000	7966000	the books. But hey,
7966000	7968000	what do I know? I have
7968000	7970000	this really weird feeling.
7970000	7972000	Give it about like six months
7972000	7974000	and there's going to be a lot of those employees
7974000	7976000	who are going to squawk. And we're going to
7976000	7978000	like there's going to be books written about
7978000	7980000	the fucking ups and fucking
7980000	7982000	downs of Telltale Games.
7982000	7984000	Because, seriously, open Twitter.
7984000	7986000	And they're already
7986000	7988000	like there's just a lot. I got something
7988000	7990000	to say. And you know what?
7990000	7992000	And I'm not making fun of it. Like
7992000	7994000	I bet there's a lot
7994000	7996000	of things that have built up that people
7996000	7998000	have wanted to say. So I'm very let
7998000	8000000	it out. Let it out y'all. Someone
8000000	8002000	needs to make a docu-series about
8002000	8004000	the gaming industry in general of
8004000	8006000	like past employees. And
8006000	8008000	one of them that I want to hear from, of course,
8008000	8010000	is Kojima. You know,
8010000	8012000	I would love
8012000	8014000	to see some type of documentary
8014000	8016000	that's very real about the game.
8016000	8018000	I'm sure there's been some, you know, if
8018000	8020000	you can think of it, it's been done, I'm sure.
8020000	8022000	So I'm sure there's documentaries on YouTube
8022000	8024000	and things like that about the gaming industry. But I would
8024000	8026000	like somebody who's like really a renowned
8026000	8028000	like documentary filmmaker. And I'm not thinking
8028000	8030000	about like Michael Moore because he's a bit partisan.
8030000	8032000	But he's very well known for his documentaries.
8032000	8034000	But I'm thinking maybe a little more like how
8034000	8036000	do you remember when you saw Super Size Me?
8036000	8038000	I don't know if you ever saw that movie. What was that guy's name?
8038000	8040000	Spurlock made that movie.
8040000	8042000	And it really opened people's eyes
8042000	8044000	to like, wow,
8044000	8046000	this is why I'm fat.
8046000	8048000	And just how McDonald's was really
8048000	8050000	pushing a lot of this stuff and the industry
8050000	8052000	in general, you know, not to pick on McDonald's, but maybe
8052000	8054000	a little bit. And it even made McDonald's change
8054000	8056000	some of their policies that they no longer
8056000	8058000	would ask, you know, you want to super size
8058000	8060000	it. And I think eventually they got rid of that and that
8060000	8062000	whole thing. And you've even commented on this before
8062000	8064000	about how like a medium drink here is like a large.
8064000	8066000	Yeah, it's crazy, right?
8066000	8068000	So anyway, the reason why I say that is that I would like a documentary
8068000	8070000	like that, but about
8070000	8072000	what really happens in the gaming industry.
8072000	8074000	How a game is really made from start to finish.
8074000	8076000	Yes. And I want it to be
8076000	8078000	something that I could be comfortable saying.
8078000	8080000	I 100%
8080000	8082000	support anybody starting
8082000	8084000	a gaming podcast. I want
8084000	8086000	voices to be out there. I want everybody to be
8086000	8088000	heard, but you need to
8088000	8090000	watch this documentary first
8090000	8092000	before you just start blindly saying this game
8092000	8094000	sucks. These people suck. All this
8094000	8096000	sucks. Like I want a documentary
8096000	8098000	that I'm going to feel comfortable saying
8098000	8100000	I support you doing this, but
8100000	8102000	first, you need to put your shoes
8102000	8104000	in, or you need to put yourself in the shoes of
8104000	8106000	somebody who's really in this. You know what I mean?
8106000	8108000	So anyway. Give some perspective to the gaming
8108000	8110000	internet. Yeah, for real.
8110000	8112000	Anyway, actdeft in chat says
8112000	8114000	granted super size me was kind of a hoax.
8114000	8116000	Okay, look, I realize there's always going to be
8116000	8118000	controversy with documentaries. There's always going to be
8118000	8120000	is it part, is it, was this lean one way or the other?
8120000	8122000	I think you all see the real point I'm
8122000	8124000	getting. I'm not saying make a copy of that, but I'm just
8124000	8126000	saying that movie love
8126000	8128000	it or hate it had a social impact
8128000	8130000	and I want to see something that
8130000	8132000	powerful about how we're treating people
8132000	8134000	that work in the game industry. Does that make sense?
8134000	8136000	Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Anyway,
8136000	8138000	um, number two, the PlayStation classic
8138000	8140000	in Rama's email. I too
8140000	8142000	had wondered why the PlayStation classic isn't coming
8142000	8144000	with dual shot controllers. They're going with the
8144000	8146000	generation of games that didn't need them. From
8146000	8148000	the reactions I saw, it seems that a lot of people
8148000	8150000	forgot that the PlayStation originally had
8150000	8152000	standard controllers. I also understand
8152000	8154000	why people were taken aback at the price tag of
8154000	8156000	$99. 20 games,
8156000	8158000	each disk about 650 megabytes.
8158000	8160000	All of the games are going to need at least
8160000	8162000	13 gigs of space at minimum,
8162000	8164000	at least 32 gigs tops.
8164000	8166000	Even at that price, I don't see
8166000	8168000	myself investing in one.
8168000	8170000	PlayStation emulation
8170000	8172000	seems to be pretty well,
8172000	8174000	so I should be able to play them on my laptop or
8174000	8176000	Surface 3 with minimal issues.
8176000	8178000	Also, if you notice, the controller ports aren't
8178000	8180000	even USB. To be quite
8180000	8182000	honest, I feel that Atari has the
8182000	8184000	right idea with their retro console.
8184000	8186000	USB, you can make your own games,
8186000	8188000	add your own extra storage.
8188000	8190000	To be quite honest, I'm seriously considering
8190000	8192000	to build my own mini retro box.
8192000	8194000	We'll see.
8194000	8196000	So, there you go. Uh, lastly,
8196000	8198000	oh, I'm sorry, no, there's a few more here. Skype
8198000	8200000	versus Discord. Uh, because I've said
8200000	8202000	on the show,
8202000	8204000	openly, I'm considering switching to Discord.
8204000	8206000	Uh, honestly, stay with Skype.
8206000	8208000	A few episodes back, we tried
8208000	8210000	to do our show on Discord because of Skype 7
8210000	8212000	being discontinued, and Skype 8
8212000	8214000	was buggy as fuck. Honestly, it did not
8214000	8216000	work. There were too many audio dropout and
8216000	8218000	lagging, so we switched back to Skype 8,
8218000	8220000	and we haven't had any issues since.
8220000	8222000	But what's interesting is that my other podcast I do
8222000	8224000	over Discord is fine. I think because
8224000	8226000	we're also streaming audio out, that could be the
8226000	8228000	issue, and I look forward to hearing updates on
8228000	8230000	the new studio streaming PC. Also,
8230000	8232000	I've used my Surface 3 to record my
8232000	8234000	podcast at conventions, so it's a great
8234000	8236000	little device. I
8236000	8238000	have considered the Surface as
8238000	8240000	an option. It's a good choice.
8240000	8242000	I've considered it. Is that what you use?
8242000	8244000	No. No. You have a different thing.
8244000	8246000	Um, I just need to make sure it can do
8246000	8248000	Twitch and everything. I have a Surface
8248000	8250000	3 Pro. I might want to bring it over.
8250000	8252000	I might want to check it out a little. If you don't mind me poking
8252000	8254000	at it a little bit. You can get them cheap.
8254000	8256000	Mine was only, like, 400
8256000	8258000	used, and it came with everything.
8258000	8260000	Anyway, anyway, I'll get in that later.
8260000	8262000	Anyway, for what you want to do, I highly
8262000	8264000	recommend a Surface Pro 5 or 6.
8264000	8266000	We can talk offline for more details on that.
8266000	8268000	Might as well just get a laptop for that price.
8268000	8270000	And then lastly, you know
8270000	8272000	Rama's got something to say about Bowsette.
8272000	8274000	I know you're
8274000	8276000	tired of the meme, and I know this has crossed
8276000	8278000	deep into your neck of the woods. For what it's
8278000	8280000	worth, it's gone deep into the anime
8280000	8282000	and cosplay fandom. I'm seeing
8282000	8284000	some great cosplays from this, with cosplayers
8284000	8286000	doing many variants, and I love it.
8286000	8288000	I know I busted your chops about it,
8288000	8290000	but it's all fun and games. Just
8290000	8292000	let us, the anime fans, enjoy
8292000	8294000	this. Here's the thing.
8294000	8296000	I'm not going to tell anyone what they can or can't
8296000	8298000	do for fun, as long as they're not hurting anybody.
8298000	8300000	I might argue that this
8300000	8302000	is hurting my eyes.
8302000	8304000	But jokes aside,
8304000	8306000	y'all can have your fun, but I
8306000	8308000	am going to sit there in my rocking chair,
8308000	8310000	and the minute someone in a Bowsette cosplay
8310000	8312000	comes up, I'm going to say, get the hell
8312000	8314000	off my lawn.
8316000	8318000	Give me that, alright?
8318000	8320000	Love and hearts
8320000	8322000	and XOs, I mean it. Alright, anyway,
8322000	8324000	back to the email. That's all that's been
8324000	8326000	on my mind. Enjoying the show. Thankful for
8326000	8328000	the podcast. Keep it fabulous.
8328000	8330000	From the East Coast, the York of New
8330000	8332000	Rama. There you go. Thank you
8332000	8334000	for the emails. Great email.
8334000	8336000	Alright, going to
8336000	8338000	another email from YYR,
8338000	8340000	who says, hello LR.
8340000	8342000	Don't worry, I don't have a laundry list
8342000	8344000	of complaints this week, but I did have
8344000	8346000	a question for Loki.
8346000	8348000	This is for you, sir. I'm listening.
8348000	8350000	Week after week, you mentioned that you've
8350000	8352000	been playing on your DDR Extreme cabinet,
8352000	8354000	but as a long time DDR player,
8354000	8356000	I'm personally interested in hearing
8356000	8358000	about your progression. What level
8358000	8360000	are you up to now? What songs have
8360000	8362000	you been working on lately? Now that you're
8362000	8364000	playing constantly, at what rate
8364000	8366000	have you been improving? Are you playing
8366000	8368000	double, or just focusing on singles
8368000	8370000	for now? You know, here's the funny part,
8370000	8372000	is I'm not improving.
8372000	8374000	That's the weirdest thing. I
8374000	8376000	always play doubles, unless
8376000	8378000	my, you know, kids
8378000	8380000	or something want me to play singles, and actually
8380000	8382000	it's weird. Playing doubles,
8382000	8384000	like, I could be used to that,
8384000	8386000	and I can play it for a while, and then I go and play
8386000	8388000	singles, and it actually really hurts my feet
8388000	8390000	to play singles. Like, it's just different.
8390000	8392000	I don't know. It's...
8392000	8394000	But, no, and sadly, I'm not really getting
8394000	8396000	much better at
8396000	8398000	it. I have been noticing
8398000	8400000	lately, though, that the machine needs to be tuned up
8400000	8402000	again, because I'm starting
8402000	8404000	to get some misses on my upper arrow on the
8404000	8406000	left side, but that's probably because
8406000	8408000	it just needs to be cleaned out again. I never did clean
8408000	8410000	the right side of the stage, either,
8410000	8412000	so I probably should do that at some point,
8412000	8414000	but, yeah, sadly,
8414000	8416000	I haven't really been progressing too much further.
8416000	8418000	I've tried to play harder songs.
8418000	8420000	I guess that's not necessarily
8420000	8422000	true, because when I started playing, I couldn't really play a whole
8422000	8424000	lot of hard stuff.
8424000	8426000	I've been kind of hanging around,
8426000	8428000	like, I
8428000	8430000	always do, like, the random Caprice stuff,
8430000	8432000	because it's just, you know,
8432000	8434000	random songs, and they usually would just play them on the
8434000	8436000	standard difficulty, but then I've been
8436000	8438000	lately been mixing it up when, you know,
8438000	8440000	DDR tends to be nice,
8440000	8442000	and throws in, you know,
8442000	8444000	hey, let's do a Legend of Max, and then followed
8444000	8446000	by, you know, Paranormal Survivor Max
8446000	8448000	on a random Caprice. I'm like, fuck
8448000	8450000	that, and I go and play something else.
8450000	8452000	So, I've been trying to play, like,
8452000	8454000	around, like, six to eight,
8454000	8456000	but I find, like, the eight-footer song, especially in doubles,
8456000	8458000	can get really tiring,
8458000	8460000	and also the hard thing, too,
8460000	8462000	is, like, after I come home and play DDR,
8462000	8464000	it's after I've walked for, like, three to
8464000	8466000	five miles that day already,
8466000	8468000	and so I can tell when I'm getting tired
8468000	8470000	because I start missing stuff more,
8470000	8472000	so I don't really care about as far as, like,
8472000	8474000	perfect attacking anything. If I pass the song, cool.
8474000	8476000	That's it.
8476000	8478000	But, yeah, I haven't really noticed that I'm, like,
8478000	8480000	can, like, all of a sudden play Max or something
8480000	8482000	now. I don't, I don't think I'm as
8482000	8484000	good as I was before.
8484000	8486000	Do you notice your stamina improving at all, though, that, like,
8486000	8488000	you know, that you were really winded in the
8488000	8490000	beginning? Because I would think that if I were to get back into
8490000	8492000	DDR every day, which I really, like, I just
8492000	8494000	really wish I could. I wish I had a
8494000	8496000	situation where I could have a DDR machine in this house.
8496000	8498000	It's just not financially
8498000	8500000	the thing to do, and we don't own this house,
8500000	8502000	so it's just not, you know, something I really want to keep here.
8502000	8504000	And even to go out and play at an
8504000	8506000	arcade, like, A,
8506000	8508000	it, I hate to say it, it's a little weird that I'm
8508000	8510000	40 years old when we have these, you know,
8510000	8512000	you know, younger kids that are playing the game. It's gonna look a little
8512000	8514000	weird. Like, am I a predator? Honestly, no, because
8514000	8516000	after, like, watching the people play
8516000	8518000	Ace, they're, like, fucking hugging the bar
8518000	8520000	on standard difficulty shit. I'm like,
8520000	8522000	I'm not judging, but I'm
8522000	8524000	judging. Well, that's a whole
8524000	8526000	nother thing you're gonna get into. But anyway,
8526000	8528000	my point is, really, though, all
8528000	8530000	that aside, I mean, you guys could tell me it doesn't matter
8530000	8532000	all you want, but the reality is, there just isn't
8532000	8534000	a machine conveniently near here.
8534000	8536000	Yes, we have machines in Sacramento, but we
8536000	8538000	have this thing called rush hour traffic,
8538000	8540000	and it's gonna change your mind about a lot of things,
8540000	8542000	too, about what's convenient to get to an amount
8542000	8544000	of time. And just the area, town
8544000	8546000	I live in, just, there's nothing convenient.
8546000	8548000	Like, sure, if there was, like, a DDR machine in
8548000	8550000	an arcade, like, right up the street, I'd probably go there
8550000	8552000	all the time. But anyway.
8552000	8554000	Alright, and then, I want to
8554000	8556000	continue with YYR's email. I can't
8556000	8558000	speak for everyone, but since a significant portion
8558000	8560000	of OLR's audience came out of the DDR
8560000	8562000	community, I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one
8562000	8564000	interested in learning more about your progress.
8564000	8566000	So I hope you'll give us regular updates as you
8566000	8568000	pursue your personal goals.
8568000	8570000	Well, funny enough, I've been thinking, actually, the last
8570000	8572000	few times I've been playing, of setting up a Twitch stream
8572000	8574000	setup. I think you should.
8574000	8576000	I've been looking into it, but, like, it's gonna
8576000	8578000	be complicated to do something like that.
8578000	8580000	Um, because I want to do, like, a
8580000	8582000	multi-camera setup type thing, but...
8582000	8584000	Well, here's my suggestion.
8584000	8586000	Start basic. Like, I know
8586000	8588000	you want to reach for the stars, and you know you want it
8588000	8590000	to be fucking primo on day one, but I'm
8590000	8592000	gonna also keep it real. OLR's
8592000	8594000	gonna convert to Twitch soon. Don't expect
8594000	8596000	it to be what we really want it to be
8596000	8598000	day one. Day one is going to be camera
8598000	8600000	pointed at us as we do this show,
8600000	8602000	like it used to be on Justin TV
8602000	8604000	all those years ago. Then, we might
8604000	8606000	start to grow more and more, but again,
8606000	8608000	I want to make, and I'm stressing this,
8608000	8610000	especially for my podcast people out there, because I know
8610000	8612000	there's a lot of you. I don't want to change
8612000	8614000	it into a video show for those of you that
8614000	8616000	are listening on audio. It's still Orange Lounge Radio,
8616000	8618000	it's just that you can watch
8618000	8620000	us do it on Twitch if you want, but, you know,
8620000	8622000	that's all gonna grow with time, and so forth.
8622000	8624000	So anyway, my point is, that's
8624000	8626000	great you want a multi-camera setup. You don't need
8626000	8628000	it day one. Right, I know that.
8628000	8630000	And it's just, um,
8630000	8632000	and not necessarily
8632000	8634000	multi-camera, like, I would just want, like,
8634000	8636000	you know, a camera and a
8636000	8638000	screen capture type thing, you know,
8638000	8640000	just so you can see that, but, like,
8640000	8642000	I don't know who would want to watch, like, me,
8642000	8644000	like, you're fucking tired,
8644000	8646000	you know, oh shit, look
8646000	8648000	at me, I barely passed the seven-footer,
8648000	8650000	ooh, you know, it's like,
8650000	8652000	yeah, but, you know,
8652000	8654000	I'm fucking tired, because I've been
8654000	8656000	exercising all day. Okay.
8656000	8658000	So, here's the thing,
8658000	8660000	here's the thing.
8660000	8662000	I streamed Forza Horizon 4 this week.
8662000	8664000	Number one, I'm terrible at Forza Horizon 2.
8664000	8666000	Forza Horizon. Number two,
8666000	8668000	I still love it. Number three,
8668000	8670000	Travis Donovan decided to crash my game,
8670000	8672000	because that's what Travis Donovan does, and as
8672000	8674000	I was driving off a cliff, he fucking pushed
8674000	8676000	me off of it, live on stream, he drove
8676000	8678000	his car into mine and pushed me off the cliff.
8678000	8680000	Now, as much as, so, it was
8680000	8682000	honestly, it was terrible. We weren't progressing in the
8682000	8684000	game at all, it was just, but,
8684000	8686000	damn it, Loki, it was the funniest
8686000	8688000	fucking thing. Like, even I had to look
8688000	8690000	at it and go, okay, this is funny, because, like, I can't
8690000	8692000	get up the hill, and then Travis comes and pushes me off the
8692000	8694000	fucking cliff, and it's funny.
8694000	8696000	So, you know what, you don't always have to be good at the games.
8696000	8698000	So, so, honestly,
8698000	8700000	Loki, just title your stream
8700000	8702000	Old Dude Getting Back into
8702000	8704000	DDR, and, like, people aren't gonna give
8704000	8706000	a fuck. Well, it's like, was it the one dude that, I don't even
8706000	8708000	remember the guy's name, but, like, he was in the Kotaku
8708000	8710000	article just this week, or something, about,
8710000	8712000	like, how he lost 125 pounds
8712000	8714000	playing DDR. It's, like, pretty much
8714000	8716000	just what I'm doing, except he's been
8716000	8718000	doing it slightly longer, like, he bought a
8718000	8720000	DDR machine, he's losing weight,
8720000	8722000	he's also eating dieting, he's lost
8722000	8724000	weight, and it's like, god damn it,
8724000	8726000	that's just the shit I'm doing, you know, so.
8726000	8728000	Document it all.
8728000	8730000	And then, make a YouTube channel, and
8730000	8732000	now you have a sponsor, and so on and
8732000	8734000	so forth, you never know. Let's not get crazy.
8734000	8736000	Alright, um, S2100Matt also
8736000	8738000	points out, you're doing something that he doesn't
8738000	8740000	see on Twitch, you're playing doubles,
8740000	8742000	most DDR people do singles.
8742000	8744000	And most people perfect attack, and I
8744000	8746000	am not gonna be perfect attacking on my machine.
8746000	8748000	It's okay, you don't have to be the best.
8748000	8750000	Because that machine
8750000	8752000	ain't capable of perfect attacking,
8752000	8754000	I think. This is going to sound
8754000	8756000	shady, but I know he would
8756000	8758000	support me 100% in this statement,
8758000	8760000	so hopefully he's out there listening still.
8760000	8762000	If Bobby Blackwolf can stream,
8762000	8764000	you can stream.
8764000	8766000	I'll consider it.
8766000	8768000	I would not have said that in a bitchy
8768000	8770000	way if I know he didn't 100% support me.
8770000	8772000	I have been thinking about it, and I've been like
8772000	8774000	looking at my garage, and like, how would I set this
8774000	8776000	up? I need to replace some lights and stuff
8776000	8778000	because it's really dark, but
8778000	8780000	I have been considering it. I may do it.
8780000	8782000	And it would
8782000	8784000	like, get me to
8784000	8786000	play even more.
8786000	8788000	But I mean, I just shit, like, fucking
8788000	8790000	the other day I walked five
8790000	8792000	miles, and then I come home and I play
8792000	8794000	DDR for like, 30 minutes.
8794000	8796000	And the problem is, like, you know, after you've walked that long,
8796000	8798000	you know, during the day, it's like
8798000	8800000	hard to play for an hour.
8800000	8802000	So.
8802000	8804000	You can get your kids involved, too. That could be fun, too.
8804000	8806000	That could be fun.
8806000	8808000	Yeah, I guess, yeah.
8808000	8810000	But there's also weirdness about putting your kids on video like that.
8810000	8812000	They don't really know how to play.
8812000	8814000	I mean, my one son's sorted.
8814000	8816000	That's the entertaining part.
8816000	8818000	Beginner mode, but then they get bored with it
8818000	8820000	pretty fast.
8820000	8822000	Alright. Anyway, and ActEftInChat
8822000	8824000	says, I think Blackwolf acknowledges his lack
8824000	8826000	of skills when playing most games. He probably doesn't
8826000	8828000	mind as long as he's out of fun.
8828000	8830000	Exactly. I do need to get into it. I just need to
8830000	8832000	buy all new gear because I don't have
8832000	8834000	anything. Exactly. And that's why,
8834000	8836000	and honestly, he's not as bad
8836000	8838000	as games as he thinks he is. Especially when it comes to
8838000	8840000	using games and stuff. Well, the other thing I've been looking to is, I've
8840000	8842000	been seriously considering
8842000	8844000	changing that over into a set medium machine
8844000	8846000	because, um,
8846000	8848000	I don't know. Because
8848000	8850000	I'm just getting kind of
8850000	8852000	bored with this all of a sudden.
8852000	8854000	Hold on. I just realized something because
8854000	8856000	what I really think you need to do
8856000	8858000	is you need to talk to
8858000	8860000	NameRedacted, but I'm gonna show
8860000	8862000	you this text message here. You need
8862000	8864000	to talk to NameRedacted
8864000	8866000	about
8866000	8868000	this on your machine.
8868000	8870000	And I bet that's something
8870000	8872000	you could do. Oh, I already know how to do that.
8872000	8874000	Oh, okay. Yeah, that I can do.
8874000	8876000	I just have to buy a new drive for that.
8876000	8878000	Alright. Yeah, and that's, and I
8878000	8880000	have, I already have that image to burn
8880000	8882000	that, but it's just, and I
8882000	8884000	thought about doing that. Alright.
8884000	8886000	But maybe, I don't know. Anyhow,
8886000	8888000	YYR concludes, that's it for me this time.
8888000	8890000	Not every email I write has to be a novel.
8890000	8892000	Well, every discussion
8892000	8894000	has to be, apparently, though. We spent like
8894000	8896000	five minutes on the email. That's alright, no.
8896000	8898000	Just almost every email.
8898000	8900000	Enjoy your week and happy gaming.
8900000	8902000	Love, YYR. I inserted the
8902000	8904000	love in there, but, you know, he'd probably
8904000	8906000	be okay with that.
8906000	8908000	Alright, let's move on. We got some
8908000	8910000	more news to get into, and then we're gonna
8910000	8912000	get to your calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one
8912000	8914000	word on Skype. Loki.
8914000	8916000	Alright. Um, so this is
8916000	8918000	kind of interesting that
8918000	8920000	it's a thing, but
8920000	8922000	um, I'm glad it's a thing, actually.
8922000	8924000	So, what's happening, Seattle Police
8924000	8926000	are launching a new anti-swatting
8926000	8928000	program, because, you know, swatting
8928000	8930000	is fucking terrible, and
8930000	8932000	people have been killed because of it,
8932000	8934000	and it's, it's really not
8934000	8936000	a great thing. So what they've done now
8936000	8938000	is they have this registry that you can basically go
8938000	8940000	and sign up on
8940000	8942000	it, and letting them know that you have
8942000	8944000	swatting concerns. Um,
8944000	8946000	then that way that they will get that
8946000	8948000	when there is
8948000	8950000	you know, a call into
8950000	8952000	the swat or whatever, saying, oh yeah,
8952000	8954000	this person's got a thing, that message
8954000	8956000	will pop up, and they're like, oh, okay,
8956000	8958000	well maybe this is, you know, a
8958000	8960000	streamer or something, and they'll proceed with, you
8960000	8962000	know, a little bit differently than they would if
8962000	8964000	they didn't have that sort of message.
8964000	8966000	So, you know,
8966000	8968000	what they need to do, I guess,
8968000	8970000	if you're in the Seattle area, there's a website
8970000	8972000	you can go to to actually do
8972000	8974000	that. They have an official swatting
8974000	8976000	resource site, and
8976000	8978000	you create your
8978000	8980000	profile, and then flag yourself as having
8980000	8982000	swatting concerns, and then what'll happen
8982000	8984000	is they say a 911 call taker
8984000	8986000	receives a report of a critical
8986000	8988000	incident, while ensuring
8988000	8990000	the first responders are dispatched to
8990000	8992000	that call for service as quickly as possible,
8992000	8994000	the caller, uh, call taker will
8994000	8996000	simultaneously check for whether
8996000	8998000	or not swatting concerns have been registered
8998000	9000000	at that address. If swatting concerns
9000000	9002000	have been registered, this information can be
9002000	9004000	shared with the responding officers, who will
9004000	9006000	still proceed to the call.
9006000	9008000	So that at least gives them kind of, like,
9008000	9010000	you know,
9010000	9012000	this is the situation I may be walking into.
9012000	9014000	It's, um, it's
9014000	9016000	an interesting solution. I'm not sure
9016000	9018000	it's a perfect solution, but
9018000	9020000	I mean, better than no solution. Exactly.
9020000	9022000	Like, at least we're trying
9022000	9024000	something to fix this problem,
9024000	9026000	so I'm like, alright, let's see, it's one
9026000	9028000	city, let's see how it goes, because if
9028000	9030000	it ends up doing well, maybe, and you know,
9030000	9032000	Seattle is a pretty big tech town,
9032000	9034000	home of Amazon, home of Microsoft,
9034000	9036000	Nintendo, right, they're all in Seattle
9036000	9038000	area, so, you know, if this does well there,
9038000	9040000	you know, maybe other, uh,
9040000	9042000	cities will take notice, and maybe this can be something
9042000	9044000	that helps, um, you know, because we know
9044000	9046000	somebody got fucking shot, that
9046000	9048000	shouldn't have been shot. Yeah, they're completely
9048000	9050000	wrong housekeeping, so, yeah.
9050000	9052000	Yeah, uh, Pooba, that wouldn't have, this
9052000	9054000	wouldn't have prevented that, unfortunately, because
9054000	9056000	No, but, at least
9056000	9058000	again, it's something, we're trying to move somewhere.
9058000	9060000	Uh, Pooba in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
9060000	9062000	says, damn, why don't we think of this sooner, smart
9062000	9064000	on the PD for this. Yeah.
9064000	9066000	It's about time, right? Yeah.
9066000	9068000	Alright, um,
9068000	9070000	moving on, let's talk about Amazon, actually,
9070000	9072000	because Amazon is having to put up
9072000	9074000	with a, uh, leaked, uh, YouTube,
9074000	9076000	or, excuse me, not YouTube, actually, it's very much
9076000	9078000	not YouTube, but a leaked video that went up
9078000	9080000	of their new MMO. It was
9080000	9082000	2 hours and 11 minutes
9082000	9084000	of streamed footage of their project
9084000	9086000	called New World.
9086000	9088000	Now, we know New World exists,
9088000	9090000	they've talked about this project before,
9090000	9092000	but what's interesting about it is that, uh,
9092000	9094000	it was, uh, originally put out
9094000	9096000	there as a Google Drive file.
9096000	9098000	The video then went to Pornhub
9098000	9100000	as backup in case
9100000	9102000	of removal, because you know how, like,
9102000	9104000	interesting things end up on Pornhub
9104000	9106000	sometimes, right? Like,
9106000	9108000	not just the obvious,
9108000	9110000	but you know how sometimes people will
9110000	9112000	put, like, legit video on there,
9112000	9114000	and some have even joked that,
9114000	9116000	like, the company that could take on
9116000	9118000	YouTube is Pornhub. 100%.
9118000	9120000	I wholeheartedly agree,
9120000	9122000	because they own, like, a lot of the
9122000	9124000	streaming services, like the different
9124000	9126000	porn streaming services,
9126000	9128000	so they, they own
9128000	9130000	a lot of them, and, I mean, all they have to do
9130000	9132000	is put out one that's not a porn service
9132000	9134000	and, boom, they've got the infrastructure
9134000	9136000	for it. Yeah.
9136000	9138000	Anyhow, the footage did get taken down
9138000	9140000	from Pornhub, aw, but, uh,
9140000	9142000	3800 people viewed it, and
9142000	9144000	you know, of course, now
9144000	9146000	it's spreading throughout the internet. Now it is on YouTube,
9146000	9148000	and, or, excuse me, there's, like,
9148000	9150000	an edited version on YouTube. Some
9150000	9152000	YouTube users took the footage and kind of, like,
9152000	9154000	compressed it down to, like, 11 minutes,
9154000	9156000	and have done their own, uh, thing.
9156000	9158000	So, anyway, what we learned about New World from the leak,
9158000	9160000	it's a third-person survival MMO.
9160000	9162000	There's resource gathering, crafting, action,
9162000	9164000	combat. Uh, the concept behind
9164000	9166000	it is that you are settling a new world, and you
9166000	9168000	join forces with other players, uh,
9168000	9170000	to form companies. You could be mercs,
9170000	9172000	prospectors, craft people, architects.
9172000	9174000	You claim territory and fight against
9174000	9176000	raiders. So, it's kind of like
9176000	9178000	a civilization-esque type of game,
9178000	9180000	but mixed with, like, I don't know,
9180000	9182000	DayZ or something?
9182000	9184000	I don't know, like, a survival type of thing.
9184000	9186000	Anyway, um, Rust.
9186000	9188000	Also, what should be noted,
9188000	9190000	speaking of PornHub and the fact that
9190000	9192000	interesting videos go up there, in 2015,
9192000	9194000	there was leaked Fallout 4
9194000	9196000	footage that made there.
9196000	9198000	Um, because, I guess, it, uh,
9198000	9200000	it takes a little longer for copyright
9200000	9202000	strikes to hit on PornHub.
9202000	9204000	They're a little slower to act, because they don't usually
9204000	9206000	get this type of stuff, whereas, like, YouTube, you know,
9206000	9208000	tends to put stuff down,
9208000	9210000	even if they maybe don't necessarily need to.
9210000	9212000	So, anyway,
9212000	9214000	kind of interesting. I don't know if we, I don't think
9214000	9216000	we have a date for New World. I think it's something that's
9216000	9218000	still being worked on. Um, it is
9218000	9220000	being made, um,
9220000	9222000	um, who is making this game?
9222000	9224000	I thought that Amazon had
9224000	9226000	a studio, but all I see is Amazon's
9226000	9228000	game. Anyway,
9228000	9230000	alright, well, let's
9230000	9232000	move on. Loki, uh, let's talk
9232000	9234000	about the next story. Yes, so, the Switch,
9234000	9236000	of course, you know, has been hacked, and
9236000	9238000	with that, RetroArch
9238000	9240000	has been added
9240000	9242000	to the system, so, they've got,
9242000	9244000	um, development now of it, I
9244000	9246000	guess, has been going on
9246000	9248000	for a while. Now, they have the
9248000	9250000	latest version that runs on the Switch,
9250000	9252000	and, of course, for those not familiar, RetroArch
9252000	9254000	is a multi-system
9254000	9256000	emulator, and
9256000	9258000	so, you can do all sorts of things, like, they have
9258000	9260000	the PSP, you know,
9260000	9262000	you can do, um, Super
9262000	9264000	Nintendo, Nintendo. In fact, actually, I run
9264000	9266000	RetroArch, um, my, um,
9266000	9268000	SNES Mini.
9268000	9270000	So, but,
9270000	9272000	it's interesting to see, though, that they have
9272000	9274000	all sorts of things running on there. Legend of Zelda,
9274000	9276000	Okuri, and Tine, they have the screenshot of that.
9276000	9278000	Um,
9278000	9280000	Ridge Racer, they're saying, you know, you can
9280000	9282000	even do split-screen Ridge Racer
9282000	9284000	on that, each person has a controller.
9284000	9286000	Um,
9286000	9288000	lots of cool stuff, but,
9288000	9290000	I don't know. I mean,
9290000	9292000	I'm not surprised that they have emulators
9292000	9294000	running on a system.
9294000	9296000	I mean, it's capable of it, which is, you know,
9296000	9298000	makes sense.
9298000	9300000	The real question is how long before Nintendo
9300000	9302000	shuts it down, but I guess they can't, right?
9302000	9304000	It's like a permanent, which might
9304000	9306000	also be the reason why they're putting out a new thing in 2019.
9306000	9308000	Exactly. Yeah.
9308000	9310000	Um, here's another reason that they might want to do that
9310000	9312000	as well, because not only are you going to be
9312000	9314000	able to run your emulators,
9314000	9316000	but you can also run mods in
9316000	9318000	Skyrim. That's right.
9318000	9320000	So, they have a tool called the Skyrim
9320000	9322000	NX Toolkit that allows people
9322000	9324000	to port over mods that were made
9324000	9326000	for other versions of the game
9326000	9328000	for the Switch now.
9328000	9330000	And, of course, the more popular mods
9330000	9332000	that are working with that,
9332000	9334000	are body mods!
9334000	9336000	So, the big-breasted naked chicks.
9336000	9338000	Hooray.
9338000	9340000	Going into Skyrim,
9340000	9342000	because that's...
9342000	9344000	Everybody wants sexy Skyrim.
9344000	9346000	Well, not everybody.
9346000	9348000	Oh, sexy Skyrim! Okay, yes.
9348000	9350000	Well, they also said,
9350000	9352000	the sexy mods have triple or more
9352000	9354000	downloads than everything else.
9354000	9356000	The other thing that they have is the intro skip mod
9356000	9358000	that they uploaded about 37 times.
9358000	9360000	Oh, a practical, useful thing.
9360000	9362000	Yeah. But nobody cares.
9362000	9364000	Sexy armor, and
9364000	9366000	all sorts of other skeleton mods.
9366000	9368000	And speaking of Skyrim,
9368000	9370000	and then previously Pornhub, I'm surprised
9370000	9372000	the amount of Skyrim porn that exists
9372000	9374000	out there. I did not know that was a thing.
9374000	9376000	There's a lot of, like, everything
9376000	9378000	porn out there. Like, there's, like, Zelda
9378000	9380000	Breath of the Wild porn. There's, like, you...
9380000	9382000	I mean, again, you think... No, but I can, like,
9382000	9384000	made in the Skyrim engine.
9384000	9386000	Oh, that they actually made it in... I think I've seen
9386000	9388000	Skyrim. Like, they made porn.
9388000	9390000	They do a lot, yeah.
9390000	9392000	In the engine, that doesn't really
9392000	9394000	lend itself well to the engine,
9394000	9396000	but they do have mods with sex
9396000	9398000	in them, and then they also have,
9398000	9400000	I'm sure,
9400000	9402000	I don't know, a lot of people use, actually, funny enough,
9402000	9404000	Source Filmmaker for
9404000	9406000	porn stuff.
9406000	9408000	Like, they'll use that to make stuff.
9408000	9410000	You know what? As soon as Super Smash Brothers
9410000	9412000	Ultimate comes out, within, like, two days, we're gonna have
9412000	9414000	Super Gangbang Ultimate. Like, it's just
9414000	9416000	a matter of time. Just wait for it.
9416000	9418000	And then, within three days,
9418000	9420000	Bowsette will be there, even though she's not in the game.
9420000	9422000	Yeah. Speaking of which, I saw there was a version
9422000	9424000	of Mario 64 that someone
9424000	9426000	modded Bowsette into, and you can play as her.
9426000	9428000	Granted, she looks
9428000	9430000	a little bit more, um, Bowser
9430000	9432000	than Bowsette, but, you know.
9436000	9438000	Moving on, let's talk about Castlevania.
9438000	9440000	Uh, there's a new Castlevania
9440000	9442000	portal. That's right, Konami,
9442000	9444000	not the portal game, sorry, meaning, like, a web
9444000	9446000	portal. Konami did launch a
9446000	9448000	Castlevania, like, website, basically.
9448000	9450000	Um, because if you go to this Castlevania
9450000	9452000	portal, you get to see a whole, like, timeline
9452000	9454000	of the series.
9454000	9456000	Uh, there's a big gap between 2014
9456000	9458000	and 2018, which is, you know, sad,
9458000	9460000	but that's the way it is. Uh, we do see
9460000	9462000	the rebirth of
9462000	9464000	Castlevania with the new, uh, you know,
9464000	9466000	Requiem that's coming out on PlayStation 4.
9466000	9468000	Um, but anyhow,
9468000	9470000	thanks to the new Castlevania series
9470000	9472000	on Netflix, thanks to Simon being
9472000	9474000	in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, uh,
9474000	9476000	more people are getting, you know, re-interested
9476000	9478000	in Castlevania, I think. So,
9478000	9480000	Konami's created this website to, kind of, educate
9480000	9482000	people a little bit on Castlevania,
9482000	9484000	but there is a section called
9484000	9486000	New Product.
9486000	9488000	Hmm. Oh, boy. I, I,
9488000	9490000	I can't wait for the new Batista
9490000	9492000	lot machine. Oh, God.
9492000	9494000	Of course, of course. So, uh,
9494000	9496000	who knows, maybe there'll be a Castlevania
9496000	9498000	new game in the works,
9498000	9500000	and hopefully it's as good as,
9500000	9502000	like, maybe when they redid Bomberman,
9502000	9504000	because I know when we think of Konami
9504000	9506000	lately, we don't have a lot of positive feelings,
9506000	9508000	but, to be fair, the Bomberman
9508000	9510000	game was a'ight, so
9510000	9512000	we'll see if the Castlevania thing
9512000	9514000	is good, too, hopefully.
9514000	9516000	That's more Hudson, though, but, you know.
9516000	9518000	Yeah, well, maybe, maybe they contracted with another
9518000	9520000	studio to do it. Who knows? We'll see,
9520000	9522000	I guess. Well, Castlevania
9522000	9524000	Requiem is not going to use the
9524000	9526000	original localization for
9526000	9528000	Symphony of the Night, so be warned.
9528000	9530000	If you were looking forward to some of the
9530000	9532000	infamous voice acting, it's not
9532000	9534000	quite the same, because, uh,
9534000	9536000	the PSP, uh,
9536000	9538000	English version is the one that's going to be
9538000	9540000	in there again. So, if you were waiting
9540000	9542000	for the What is a Man? Nope.
9542000	9544000	You're gonna get the redone voice lines
9544000	9546000	from PSP's Dracula X Chronicles.
9546000	9548000	That is also the
9548000	9550000	same for Rondo of
9550000	9552000	Blood. So,
9552000	9554000	um, well, that's too bad.
9554000	9556000	But, um, not surprising either,
9556000	9558000	especially after the Silent Hill remake, so
9558000	9560000	there's clearly something going on with the voice actor
9560000	9562000	rules and all that stuff, so.
9562000	9564000	Alright, a few more stories for you guys, then we're gonna
9564000	9566000	get to the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,
9566000	9568000	all one word on Skype. But first, Loki.
9568000	9570000	Yes, but first we have to talk about the
9570000	9572000	final conclusion of what,
9572000	9574000	you know, fighting games are going
9574000	9576000	towards. So, you may notice
9576000	9578000	that with each fighting game that comes out,
9578000	9580000	we're pushing the boundaries of
9580000	9582000	outfits and
9582000	9584000	what scantily clad,
9584000	9586000	you know, outfits
9586000	9588000	the characters have and the boob
9588000	9590000	physics and stuff like that.
9590000	9592000	Well, it's only a matter of
9592000	9594000	time, and the time is now,
9594000	9596000	that a game should
9596000	9598000	exist called Naked Fighter 3D.
9598000	9600000	And it is a one-man project.
9600000	9602000	A one-man indie project, you may
9602000	9604000	will. It's a turn-based
9604000	9606000	fighting game where you
9606000	9608000	fight naked people
9608000	9610000	against naked people.
9610000	9612000	That's right. You can
9612000	9614000	fight women against men, against
9614000	9616000	transsexuals, whatever you
9616000	9618000	want. With a custom
9618000	9620000	character creator,
9620000	9622000	I don't know. It's a unity
9622000	9624000	thing, I guess, now, but
9624000	9626000	if you want to check it out, they've got a demo.
9626000	9628000	And they have, like, skill trees
9628000	9630000	and stuff, and there's- Boy, I can't wait.
9630000	9632000	It's just-
9632000	9634000	Is there a dong slider? There is a
9634000	9636000	dong slider for both male and female.
9638000	9640000	Okay.
9640000	9642000	I'm just gonna let the internet
9642000	9644000	have its thing. It can just, the internet
9644000	9646000	just, it can exist.
9646000	9648000	Well, they'll make, inevitably,
9648000	9650000	Naked Bowsette.
9650000	9652000	I'm curious, like, how a turn-based
9652000	9654000	fighting game works, though. Like, how's
9654000	9656000	that, you mean?
9656000	9658000	I'd be curious to see how that plays.
9658000	9660000	But this is weird.
9660000	9662000	I guess it's like a Final Fantasy type,
9662000	9664000	you know, fight, select
9664000	9666000	option, slap,
9666000	9668000	kick. But if you're
9668000	9670000	interested, they have a Patreon.
9670000	9672000	So Patreon.com slash Naked Fighter
9672000	9674000	3D. For more information,
9674000	9676000	you can go download that demo, and
9676000	9678000	go check it out.
9678000	9680000	Bobby Blackwolf asked, why didn't you download the demo,
9680000	9682000	Logie? Um, I did.
9682000	9684000	I haven't played it, though. Hey,
9684000	9686000	I got to. I gotta try it.
9686000	9688000	For research purposes only.
9688000	9690000	Gotta see what it is.
9690000	9692000	I'm curious, like, how a turn-based fighting,
9692000	9694000	like, how- I mean, I'm curious, too.
9694000	9696000	How do you make a turn-based fighting game?
9696000	9698000	We're all a little curious.
9698000	9700000	I mean,
9700000	9702000	I've already seen the videos. The videos are
9702000	9704000	goddamn ridiculous, you know, with the sliders
9704000	9706000	and everything, but, um,
9706000	9708000	yeah.
9708000	9710000	It's a thing.
9710000	9712000	Alright, uh,
9712000	9714000	anyhow, one more story for you guys before we
9714000	9716000	open up the Skype line, and this has to do with
9716000	9718000	Steam, uh, and the removal
9718000	9720000	of minigames. Speaking of, like, porny games,
9720000	9722000	Steam has recently removed
9722000	9724000	179 games,
9724000	9726000	uh, and this is probably from
9726000	9728000	the whole, like, if you're trying to troll purposely,
9728000	9730000	it's nice to see they've finally
9730000	9732000	maybe gone back a little bit on the whole, like,
9732000	9734000	well, things on Steam should offend you
9734000	9736000	and that whole bullshit thing that they were-
9736000	9738000	their line was recently.
9738000	9740000	But anyhow, uh, apparently,
9740000	9742000	about 179 games have been removed in the past
9742000	9744000	few weeks, including such titles
9744000	9746000	as Make Border Great Again,
9746000	9748000	Big Dick,
9748000	9750000	Milf, Hentai Sisters,
9750000	9752000	Putin, Boobs,
9752000	9754000	and Trump. I mean, I was looking forward to
9754000	9756000	that one myself. Uh,
9756000	9758000	Logan versus KSI,
9758000	9760000	which is, I don't know what that means,
9760000	9762000	and my life is probably better for it.
9762000	9764000	Um, Logan Paul and KSI, they
9764000	9766000	did a boxing match. No, okay, I got it.
9766000	9768000	They're two YouTubers.
9768000	9770000	Uh, 31 different games that have some
9770000	9772000	variation on the title Achievement Hunter.
9772000	9774000	So, anyhow, now we have an
9774000	9776000	idea what Steam means when they
9776000	9778000	say trolling,
9778000	9780000	basically. So, I guess
9780000	9782000	that's nice. Anyway,
9782000	9784000	ugh.
9784000	9786000	Yep, Steam is kind of a garbage
9786000	9788000	dump, uh, of games sometimes,
9788000	9790000	and, uh, yeah, I-
9790000	9792000	I think they might need to curate their
9792000	9794000	stuff a little better, but at least they're making some
9794000	9796000	attempts at it by, uh, scraping a lot of this
9796000	9798000	bottom-of-the-barrel stuff out of the store.
9798000	9800000	So, there you go.
9800000	9802000	Siya Tabiri in our chat suggests,
9802000	9804000	Professor Layaton and the Mystery
9804000	9806000	Box. No, that's-
9806000	9808000	I might actually play that.
9808000	9810000	That sounds like a porny title, like, you know how, like,
9810000	9812000	they might do, like, a porn
9812000	9814000	take on a big, like,
9814000	9816000	like, Lord of the Cockring or something, like,
9816000	9818000	it would be- Saving Ryan's Privates.
9818000	9820000	Yeah, Shaving Ryan's Privates, yeah.
9820000	9822000	Yeah, exactly. Anyway,
9822000	9824000	let's get to the
9824000	9826000	Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,
9826000	9828000	all one word on
9828000	9830000	Skype. Um,
9830000	9832000	I'm trying to think, um, cause you know I run-
9832000	9834000	and the Skype line is open.
9834000	9836000	Uh, since we're talking about funny porn titles,
9836000	9838000	you know, I run with the Rocky Horror Crowd
9838000	9840000	and they know some weird shit, so I think the funniest
9840000	9842000	porn thing I ever saw was
9842000	9844000	Beaver and Buttface,
9844000	9846000	which was Beavis and Butthead, and I
9846000	9848000	swear to God, one of the actors goes,
9848000	9850000	huh, huh, I think I'm gonna cum or something.
9852000	9854000	It was ridiculous.
9854000	9856000	Anyway, Skype line is lit up,
9856000	9858000	let's get to it. Uh, and then
9858000	9860000	wow, those calls I was trying to take
9860000	9862000	just straight up disappeared.
9862000	9864000	So,
9864000	9866000	so, the chatters are yelling at
9866000	9868000	me, Poopa says, Rob, no, I'm
9868000	9870000	sorry, but if I had to see this
9870000	9872000	and had it seared into my brain for all eternity,
9872000	9874000	guess what, so do you.
9874000	9876000	And Dartasuya says, I'm pretty
9876000	9878000	sure Bowsette already has a porn
9878000	9880000	parody. She does. Yes, unfortunately,
9880000	9882000	that crossed my desk this week
9882000	9884000	and went
9884000	9886000	immediately into the trash
9886000	9888000	receptacle. Alright,
9888000	9890000	I'm trying to get some calls, dang it, Skype
9890000	9892000	cooperate, here we go. Hi, you're on Orange
9892000	9894000	Lounge Radio, who's this?
9894000	9896000	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio,
9896000	9898000	who's this?
9898000	9900000	Perhaps we have a connection
9900000	9902000	on Orange Lounge Radio. Oh, sorry, I don't know
9902000	9904000	why my headset was muted, but it
9904000	9906000	was. That's alright. Hi, who's this?
9906000	9908000	This is Eric RPG. Hey, Eric RPG,
9908000	9910000	what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
9910000	9912000	Um, just wanna talk about, uh,
9912000	9914000	two open world games I've been playing and
9914000	9916000	they're polar opposites of each other.
9916000	9918000	Okay, what's the first one? The first one's
9918000	9920000	Assassin's Creed Odyssey.
9920000	9922000	Oh, yeah, I was curious about
9922000	9924000	this game, but I was- I hate
9924000	9926000	this thing. Really, because
9926000	9928000	I, it looked really interesting, but
9928000	9930000	I was really turned off
9930000	9932000	when I heard that they were selling in the
9932000	9934000	store this $10 thing for double
9934000	9936000	XP and just, and that, like,
9936000	9938000	double XP was kinda like what you needed
9938000	9940000	to really progress through the game.
9940000	9942000	There's a part of me that's like, just
9942000	9944000	tack $10 on to the
9944000	9946000	price of your game, stop being a coward,
9946000	9948000	this is what you wanna do,
9948000	9950000	just do it. Like, charge what
9950000	9952000	you're really trying to charge for the game and stop
9952000	9954000	all this other bullshit. But anyway, what are
9954000	9956000	your thoughts? The experience that you get for doing quests
9956000	9958000	is not as much as
9958000	9960000	you could get in Origins, and even
9960000	9962000	Origins kinda felt grindy,
9962000	9964000	but, like, it wasn't nearly as
9964000	9966000	bad as this game. That's unfortunate.
9966000	9968000	Because I didn't mind doing the quests then.
9968000	9970000	But, um, I don't have the kind of time
9970000	9972000	the game demands for me, and it
9972000	9974000	is sorta like, like, like a pay-to-win
9974000	9976000	game where you, where they basically
9976000	9978000	are cajoling you into paying
9978000	9980000	for the experience booster.
9980000	9982000	Which was, which
9982000	9984000	is something that didn't exist in a previous game.
9984000	9986000	But, um, that
9986000	9988000	along with the fact that the game is very
9988000	9990000	repetitious to begin with,
9990000	9992000	like, sure, there are some unique
9992000	9994000	quests that you can do that, like,
9994000	9996000	give you decent rewards, but most of
9996000	9998000	them are pretty much, go
9998000	10000000	here and kill a lot of dudes.
10000000	10002000	Or
10002000	10004000	steal something, but you end up
10004000	10006000	killing a lot of dudes anyways, because they're in your way.
10006000	10008000	Well, that's unfortunate.
10008000	10010000	I haven't heard quite as negative
10010000	10012000	of a reception of the game as a whole,
10012000	10014000	except for the microtransactions part,
10014000	10016000	but I gotta admit that- That ruins it, though.
10016000	10018000	Yeah, no, I hear ya.
10018000	10020000	In the, everything else I just
10020000	10022000	mentioned.
10022000	10024000	It wouldn't feel so grindy if you
10024000	10026000	just got double XP out the gate.
10026000	10028000	And then there's
10028000	10030000	a game like Spider-Man, which I also
10030000	10032000	played. It's like, I ran in
10032000	10034000	the other game from Redbox
10034000	10036000	because no other Redbox had Spider-Man.
10036000	10038000	It's like, I'll do this over the weekend, because
10038000	10040000	I'm taking Monday off.
10040000	10042000	And, um,
10042000	10044000	I tried playing it for
10044000	10046000	most of Saturday, and then I just returned
10046000	10048000	it on Sunday against Spider-Man today.
10048000	10050000	And how's Spider-Man?
10050000	10052000	Spider-Man is everything
10052000	10054000	that an open world game should be doing.
10054000	10056000	I mean, it still
10056000	10058000	has a lot of that, like, stupid
10058000	10060000	fetch quest stuff that's more
10060000	10062000	busywork and doesn't have any real
10062000	10064000	significant story content.
10064000	10066000	And there's a lot of collectible
10066000	10068000	junk, but, um,
10068000	10070000	it's a lot more fun game,
10070000	10072000	tight controls, and,
10072000	10074000	like, even on my
10074000	10076000	base PS4, I mean, I did experience
10076000	10078000	some issues, but I think that has more
10078000	10080000	to do with the fact that I probably need to, like,
10080000	10082000	defrag the hard drive.
10082000	10084000	Because that happens after a while,
10084000	10086000	after you've downloaded a lot.
10086000	10088000	That's very true. It's something, uh, sometimes
10088000	10090000	I even forget to do. But you can't defrag
10090000	10092000	a solid state drive.
10092000	10094000	Yeah, I'm just using
10094000	10096000	a standard drive. Yeah, I hear you.
10096000	10098000	But I probably should just
10098000	10100000	get an external.
10100000	10102000	So, you mentioned you rented
10102000	10104000	Spider-Man. Do you think you're gonna end up
10104000	10106000	purchasing it, because you like it so much?
10106000	10108000	Um,
10108000	10110000	I'm probably gonna beat it to completion,
10110000	10112000	but I might just decide to
10112000	10114000	not do that and return it tomorrow, because
10114000	10116000	I can get it later, hopefully on a
10116000	10118000	Black Friday sale.
10118000	10120000	Because I'll probably be playing it even after I
10120000	10122000	beat the main game. Yeah.
10122000	10124000	Alright, well, I'm very curious
10124000	10126000	to check out Spider-Man as well, and I'm happy to
10126000	10128000	hear you don't have the same microtransaction stuff, but
10128000	10130000	I don't get quite as into the Marvel
10130000	10132000	stuff as other people do, but,
10132000	10134000	like, or DC, really,
10134000	10136000	but I did, I mean, even, I say that,
10136000	10138000	but I did buy, like, Arkham
10138000	10140000	City or whatever, what was the one, the
10140000	10142000	open, big open world one, and it was
10142000	10144000	really good. Arkham
10144000	10146000	Knight? Yeah, that might have been it. Um, and it was,
10146000	10148000	it was good, so I hear a lot of
10148000	10150000	the, it's basically that with Spider-Man,
10150000	10152000	and I'm like, okay, I'm into it.
10152000	10154000	Yeah, um,
10154000	10156000	I didn't like Arkham Knight as much as
10156000	10158000	Arkham Asylum or Arkham City,
10158000	10160000	because, uh, they put it in the
10160000	10162000	tank sections, and I was like, this is
10162000	10164000	not a Batman game anymore, why is this here?
10164000	10166000	Maybe it was Arkham Asylum,
10166000	10168000	I thought that was the first game, but anyway,
10168000	10170000	but yeah, that's, uh, that game
10170000	10172000	was really good, and then I hear a lot about the Spider-Mans
10172000	10174000	really good too, and I see all these screenshots
10174000	10176000	that look great, like, the game just looks like it's really
10176000	10178000	pretty, so.
10178000	10180000	But other than that, I've been playing
10180000	10182000	Mega Man 11, which I think is
10182000	10184000	probably,
10184000	10186000	I'm gonna put it above 9,
10186000	10188000	just a little bit. Okay.
10188000	10190000	As, like, one of my favorite Mega Man games,
10190000	10192000	my favorite being the third,
10192000	10194000	and then 9 being
10194000	10196000	number 2, that would be,
10196000	10198000	this would be a number 3.
10198000	10200000	How many games are in this series?
10200000	10202000	Um,
10202000	10204000	11, plus the side games,
10204000	10206000	like, uh, the spin-offs
10206000	10208000	like, uh, X and
10208000	10210000	all that stuff.
10210000	10212000	But, um,
10212000	10214000	so those are my top 3, and
10214000	10216000	um, I do think
10216000	10218000	that, uh, the game has
10218000	10220000	a little bit of, uh,
10220000	10222000	it's kind of, it's kind of like
10222000	10224000	barebones, but, um,
10224000	10226000	I guess that
10226000	10228000	Capcom did essentially
10228000	10230000	what they needed to do, and
10230000	10232000	didn't try to overreach, just to
10232000	10234000	prevent themselves from screwing it up too much.
10234000	10236000	But I could
10236000	10238000	yell at Capcom for also doing the same thing that
10238000	10240000	Ubisoft did with
10240000	10242000	Assassin's Creed Odyssey that they're going to be doing
10242000	10244000	with Devil May Cry 5.
10244000	10246000	Basically the same thing.
10246000	10248000	Where they'll charge you money
10248000	10250000	to pay for extra boost,
10250000	10252000	experience boost, so you can get more red orbs.
10252000	10254000	Yeah, I just wish, if game
10254000	10256000	companies want to do this, they just
10256000	10258000	make the game $70 already,
10258000	10260000	and just give us the right proper
10260000	10262000	balancing in the game, because this is
10262000	10264000	just, it's just getting ridiculous.
10264000	10266000	And it's just, it's, I realize
10266000	10268000	games are expensive to develop, and they need to
10268000	10270000	make their money back, but,
10270000	10272000	like, you're shooting yourself in the foot
10272000	10274000	by making the money back in this manner.
10274000	10276000	Yeah.
10276000	10278000	One thing I will comment on in regards to
10278000	10280000	that, at least Capcom did well
10280000	10282000	in terms of Mega Man, is that
10282000	10284000	it is not priced as a full pop
10284000	10286000	game, so even though, yes, it is simplistic
10286000	10288000	in its offerings, it is
10288000	10290000	not charged at, you know, a full
10290000	10292000	$59.99, so I believe it was,
10292000	10294000	I don't know what the Canadian, the Canadian
10294000	10296000	or US price equivalent is,
10296000	10298000	but it was a $39.99 in Canada,
10298000	10300000	so I think it's probably $29.99 for you guys.
10300000	10302000	Probably, yeah. So, there's that
10302000	10304000	at least. Yeah, there is that.
10304000	10306000	Alright. Well, Eric RPG,
10306000	10308000	I'm going to let you go so I can get some more calls,
10308000	10310000	but thank you for your thoughts.
10310000	10312000	Yeah, and maybe you could tune
10312000	10314000	into RP Grinders'
10314000	10316000	podcast, where me and
10316000	10318000	Breakman have been doing
10318000	10320000	Mega Man Retrospective, but
10320000	10322000	we'll have a final episode soon
10322000	10324000	and we'll probably have our reviews
10324000	10326000	of Mega Man 11 up then.
10326000	10328000	Alright. And we tend to go
10328000	10330000	live around Wednesdays
10330000	10332000	at 7,
10332000	10334000	no, 8,
10334000	10336000	yeah, 8 PM Eastern.
10336000	10338000	Alright.
10338000	10340000	Check that out, RP Grinders. Alright.
10340000	10342000	See you later. Take care. Bye.
10342000	10344000	OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word
10344000	10346000	on Skype if you want to get in.
10346000	10348000	You can try to get in right now.
10348000	10350000	Meanwhile, while we're
10350000	10352000	waiting for, what?
10352000	10354000	As fast as I talk, it lights right back up.
10354000	10356000	Let's get to another call. Hi, OrangeLoungeRadio,
10356000	10358000	who's this? Hey, what's going on, everyone?
10358000	10360000	It's Rama. Hey, Rama. An email
10360000	10362000	and a call tonight. Two for one
10362000	10364000	special. Alright, what's up, buddy?
10364000	10366000	Okay, in response to that
10366000	10368000	naked fighting game, I just
10368000	10370000	have one thing to say about that. What's that?
10370000	10372000	Excuse me
10372000	10374000	while I whip this out. Oh,
10374000	10376000	please don't.
10376000	10378000	No, thank you.
10378000	10380000	Hard pass.
10380000	10382000	They have groin kicks in the game.
10382000	10384000	They have what? Groin kicks.
10384000	10386000	Well, that seems appropriate. Oh, boy.
10386000	10388000	Is that what you wanted to talk about, was
10388000	10390000	naked fighting, Rama? No, I
10390000	10392000	did that two weeks ago, but that's the story for another
10392000	10394000	time, another show, and so on and so forth,
10394000	10396000	et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
10396000	10398000	Oh, righty then.
10398000	10400000	Oh, okay.
10400000	10402000	You're the one that brought up Folsom
10402000	10404000	Street fair. Hold on, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
10404000	10406000	Delvin, could you go get me the
10406000	10408000	brain bleach? It's in the other room.
10408000	10412000	Because
10412000	10414000	my brain hurts right now.
10414000	10416000	It was too much.
10416000	10418000	It was just too much. No, I'm kidding. Alright,
10418000	10420000	what's really up?
10420000	10422000	I gotta throw my two cents in about this
10422000	10424000	DDR movie. I mean,
10424000	10426000	I'm picturing
10426000	10428000	the final stage,
10428000	10430000	the final part of the movie,
10430000	10432000	since you brought up Scott Pilgrim. They're in his
10432000	10434000	warehouse. The bad boss is on the
10434000	10436000	left side. Our hero
10436000	10438000	is in the
10438000	10440000	bathroom, just getting
10440000	10442000	motivated, and it's like that whole scene from
10442000	10444000	8 Mile, and you see him come out in
10444000	10446000	the hoodie, and they just do
10446000	10448000	max 300,
10448000	10450000	1.5, skip.
10450000	10452000	That's not gonna
10452000	10454000	make a fun movie.
10454000	10456000	That's not gonna be a good
10456000	10458000	movie. It might.
10458000	10460000	I'm just, in reference to earlier
10460000	10462000	chat, me and Bob Coffey were talking about, they have
10462000	10464000	been animes with similar
10464000	10466000	plotlines,
10466000	10468000	and it worked. I mean,
10468000	10470000	fuck, if you've
10470000	10472000	played, um,
10472000	10474000	Elite Beat Agents is basically the same thing.
10474000	10476000	I just feel like the
10476000	10478000	DDR movie is gonna be You've Got
10478000	10480000	Served, too. I really just feel
10480000	10482000	like that's what it's gonna be.
10482000	10484000	I mean, well,
10484000	10486000	if it's anything like La Machina de Baja,
10486000	10488000	I will be in the front row watching it.
10488000	10490000	I guess I need to give it a chance
10490000	10492000	and see what they turn, but I just, you know, again,
10492000	10494000	DDR doesn't have a
10494000	10496000	story. Like, at least Monster
10496000	10498000	Hunter and Mega Man kind of, like, have
10498000	10500000	stories, but DDR just, like,
10500000	10502000	doesn't have a story, and that's okay.
10502000	10504000	It doesn't, like, it's
10504000	10506000	a great game. It doesn't need
10506000	10508000	a story. Well, there
10508000	10510000	was a DDR manga that
10510000	10512000	came out sometime back.
10512000	10514000	It was not an official one.
10514000	10516000	It was a fan. A friend of mine did
10516000	10518000	call the 10K Millennium.
10518000	10520000	It was, it was really cool. It was basically
10520000	10522000	a DDR tournament. It was
10522000	10524000	a cash cow.
10524000	10526000	Hahahaha.
10526000	10528000	But I tell you what,
10528000	10530000	this current idea for a DDR
10530000	10532000	film is a hell of a lot better than the
10532000	10534000	supposed one that floated around back in
10534000	10536000	2000. I never saw that one.
10536000	10538000	What was that supposed to be?
10538000	10540000	Well, according
10540000	10542000	to what was supposed to be with that
10542000	10544000	script, it was about
10544000	10546000	a boy teaching a girl
10546000	10548000	English through DDR.
10548000	10550000	Are we sure
10550000	10552000	this wasn't, like, DDR Freak fanfic?
10552000	10554000	No. Alright, are we
10554000	10556000	sure? I'm positive.
10556000	10558000	Alright, just making sure. Are we very sure? Hahahaha.
10558000	10560000	I'm very, very sure. I remember
10560000	10562000	if I could've sworn this was
10562000	10564000	discussed on a show back in
10564000	10566000	the day. No, it probably was
10566000	10568000	and there's a really good reason I've forgotten
10568000	10570000	over the years.
10570000	10572000	What's funny is that
10572000	10574000	I may not remember certain things
10574000	10576000	at work, but I sure as fuck remember shit like
10576000	10578000	this. I know. I know.
10578000	10580000	Whereas I can't remember what happened on this show
10580000	10582000	last week, but that's why you guys are all great.
10582000	10584000	Like, some of the, I swear to God, some of the,
10584000	10586000	some days I feel like RuPaul around here.
10586000	10588000	And I say that joke because, and Delvin understands
10588000	10590000	this, and some of you out there too, if you ever
10590000	10592000	listen to, like, RuPaul's podcast and stuff, like,
10592000	10594000	you learn, like, just, like, he is
10594000	10596000	such an old man.
10596000	10598000	Like, he does not, like, he, like, seriously,
10598000	10600000	Michelle's like, yeah, Carson's been playing Fortnite
10600000	10602000	and Ru's like, what's a Fortnite?
10602000	10604000	No, no, Rob, I
10604000	10606000	can tell you exactly what happened on last
10606000	10608000	week's show. You had a mimosa
10608000	10610000	and you went total B-Arthur on everyone.
10610000	10612000	I had a mimosa last week.
10612000	10614000	I don't remember that.
10614000	10616000	We do.
10616000	10618000	No, seriously, I didn't have a mimosa.
10618000	10620000	I'd remember that. Now,
10620000	10622000	last night,
10622000	10624000	well, I had a lot to drink.
10624000	10626000	That's a different story.
10626000	10628000	But we're not that, what had happened was,
10628000	10630000	no, we're not gonna talk about it on this show.
10630000	10632000	Alright.
10632000	10634000	Anyway, I'm gonna let you go, my friend.
10634000	10636000	But thank you for the call, except for that one
10636000	10638000	part that I will have seared in my brain
10638000	10640000	for all time. But,
10640000	10642000	you brought it up, I'm sorry.
10642000	10644000	Bye.
10644000	10646000	Bye.
10646000	10648000	Alright. That's gonna do it for the
10648000	10650000	Skype line tonight. Thank you guys
10650000	10652000	who were able to get through. If you didn't get through, though,
10652000	10654000	please feel free to send us an email.
10654000	10656000	Participate at OrangelaungeRadio.com
10656000	10658000	is the place where you, too, can send an email
10658000	10660000	and have it read on a future episode.
10660000	10662000	But, for now, we're gonna
10662000	10664000	proceed to wrap up the show.
10664000	10666000	As I always say at the end of the show, if you
10666000	10668000	enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell
10668000	10670000	a friend or five about the show. Help us spread
10670000	10672000	the word, because we are the show where every gamer has
10672000	10674000	a voice, but if the voices aren't here,
10674000	10676000	then how can we air them?
10676000	10678000	So, tell a friend or two.
10678000	10680000	A nice five star review in a place like iTunes
10680000	10682000	goes an awful long way, and we
10682000	10684000	excuse me, we would really appreciate
10684000	10686000	those. Delvin,
10686000	10688000	all the way from Toronto, Canada,
10688000	10690000	thank you so much for being here tonight.
10690000	10692000	Thank you for having me. I am so
10692000	10694000	happy you finally got to actually be on
10694000	10696000	the show. You came all the way to Sacramento,
10696000	10698000	just to be on OLR.
10698000	10700000	There wasn't, like, work involved in San
10700000	10702000	Francisco or anything. You came all the way
10702000	10704000	out here just to be on OLR.
10704000	10706000	Oh, and just to see you and Alan, of course.
10706000	10708000	No, I love it, I love it.
10708000	10710000	Come back any time.
10710000	10712000	It might be a while,
10712000	10714000	but yeah. And hopefully when I come
10714000	10716000	to Toronto, you can actually do
10716000	10718000	an episode of Video Game Realness and I can be there.
10718000	10720000	Oh yeah, absolutely. Okay, work. That sounds awesome.
10720000	10722000	Anyway, give us the social media plugs one more
10722000	10724000	time. Where can people follow you if they want to see more of
10724000	10726000	Delvin and company?
10726000	10728000	So you can see the pod, or listen
10728000	10730000	to the podcast at videogamerealness.com
10730000	10732000	You can follow us on Twitter

10740000	10742000	Please send all our best to your
10742000	10744000	co-hosts over on Video Game Realness. I know there's
10744000	10746000	really four of you there. It's not just you, but you know.
10746000	10748000	Absolutely. I appreciate you representing
10748000	10750000	the show tonight. I'm here.
10750000	10752000	All right. Where are they
10752000	10754000	though? Where is she though?
10754000	10756000	Where is she though?
10756000	10758000	All right. Oh, and we always ask
10758000	10760000	at the end of the show, of course, if you have any final thoughts.
10760000	10762000	So do you have any final thoughts you'd like to leave
10762000	10764000	our listeners with tonight?
10764000	10766000	Eh?
10766000	10768000	Perfect.
10768000	10770000	Thank you. Oh, I love
10770000	10772000	that song. It's my favorite DDR song. Okay, anyway.
10772000	10774000	Uh, Loki, how about you?
10774000	10776000	Your final thought tonight?
10776000	10778000	My final thought is we didn't do
10778000	10780000	last minute stories, but I
10780000	10782000	had one thing real quick I want to talk about.
10782000	10784000	Okay, fair enough. Toys R Us.
10784000	10786000	Should we talk about Toys
10786000	10788000	R Us? I mean, we can,
10788000	10790000	but I can't believe that they're
10790000	10792000	now thinking about coming back?
10792000	10794000	After they've fired all those people, sure.
10794000	10796000	Well, technically, I think it's a company that's
10796000	10798000	selling the brand as Toys R Us.
10798000	10800000	So it's not really Toys R
10800000	10802000	Us. It's somebody who cut up
10802000	10804000	Toys R Us and is now wearing them as a dress.
10804000	10806000	That's a Toys
10806000	10808000	R Us skin suit.
10808000	10810000	That is what is happening, yes.
10810000	10812000	Okay. All right.
10812000	10814000	My final thought is
10814000	10816000	I'm still trying to work on
10816000	10818000	game development stuff.
10818000	10820000	This hasn't helped that I've been tired
10820000	10822000	or had a headache for two days, you know.
10822000	10824000	But I've been
10824000	10826000	working. The thing, the problem I have is
10826000	10828000	that I keep starting stuff and then
10828000	10830000	running the roadblocks of what I can and
10830000	10832000	cannot do by myself with my
10832000	10834000	current knowledge, and so that's kind of
10834000	10836000	why I keep jumping between projects, because
10836000	10838000	it's just like, I get into this thing where I
10838000	10840000	have to, like, research a bunch of stuff, and it's like,
10840000	10842000	I want to make progress now, and I'm
10842000	10844000	impatient with that.
10844000	10846000	All right. Figure it out.
10846000	10848000	My final thought is I need my
10848000	10850000	Pokémon storage increased to 2,000.
10850000	10852000	I need it. I need it. No,
10852000	10854000	I don't have a problem keeping three of every
10854000	10856000	type of Pokémon. You have a problem.
10856000	10858000	I was just going to say, I was like, maybe you should keep
10858000	10860000	three of every goddamn Pokémon.
10860000	10862000	I don't have a problem. You have a problem.
10862000	10864000	You have a problem. Good night, everybody.
