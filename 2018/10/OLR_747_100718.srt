Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

Strike one down and another two pop up in its place

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's the story of how PUBG has banned 13 million accounts and counting

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Cheaters and scammers know no bounds, but we've got better news of new content coming soon

Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

Orange Lounge Radio

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Live tonight, episode number 747 for this, October the 7th, 2018

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here in Sacramento, California

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Studio N7, where our show is based

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Live for the next few hours, talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
With you guys in our live chat, as well as my co-hosts here in studio, say hello to Loki

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hello

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How are you, Loki?

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm good

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Good, you're eating Korean BBQ on the show tonight

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes, which is not something you usually get, because I thought Korean BBQ was very expensive

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It is

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There must be something very specific you were craving tonight

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's the bulgogi beef, but the problem is though, the bulgogi that you get with Takeout

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Is not the same as the bulgogi that you cook at a Korean BBQ

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's like, it's thicker, it's covered with tons of barbecue teriyaki sauce

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This was dry

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Thankfully I ordered an extra side of teriyaki sauce

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Thank gosh, thank gosh

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's funny because you had Korean BBQ, I had bulgogi BBQ

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So it's like BBQ city tonight

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And then a couple nights ago, I had Lucille's BBQ, the more southern BBQ type of stuff

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Mmm

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
BBQ

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We've just seen a BBQ fusion restaurant

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's right, there's BBQ with some orange entrees tonight

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
All of the BBQ

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
All of the BBQ, anyway

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Dark Sakura, she is still out on leave

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
She'll be joining us a little later in the show for the Classic Game of the Week

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But we do have someone else here in studio with us tonight

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
To help us along with Dark Sakura's absence

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm very happy to welcome him to the show because I know he's been listening for a while

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And he has a show of his own which is fantastic

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And he came a very long way to be here

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So all the way from Toronto, say hello everybody to Delvin

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hello

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
How are you?

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm really good

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So you have a show called Video Game Realness

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That is correct

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well it's not your show, you're your friends

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah, it's a group of friends

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's a group of friends that all do it together

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Tell us a little bit about Video Game Realness

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So we started about 5 years ago I want to say now

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You see a boat

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And so, yeah, 5 years ago it's me, one of my old roommates Cameron and my two friends James and Michael

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We just shoot the shit talking about video games because we used to do it all the time

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Going to dinner and stuff

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
One day we just decided let's just put this on tape and record it

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This sounds so familiar

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Doesn't this sound familiar, Loki?

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yeah

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So yeah, we

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
No, I love it

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We just get together, talk about video games

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's usually quite random and quite stupid and silly but that's just how we are

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah, actually I loved, you know, again I would encourage folks to go listen to Video Game Realness

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Although I notice your episodes are kind of sporadic

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You just kind of do them when you feel like it

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah, we're on a regular schedule but, you know, life gets in the way and now we just do it when there's something to talk about

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I respect that, I respect that but I will say, not to give away all your jokes

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But on the most recent episode, something that had me rolling, you already know this

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Was you guys were talking about the new Switch game that's coming out, Starlink

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yes

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Which is Ubisoft's game

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But we keep seeing all these in the trailers and in the Nintendo Directs

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
They're like, Star Fox is in Starlink

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So finish this joke here

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So basically, every time Nintendo talks about the game, they pretty much promote it as a Star Fox game

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Right

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And I don't know what the game's about

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I mean, they might kind of say it by Ubisoft, you know, they just kind of like skim over the details

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah, so there's this comic out there, James had shared it with our group

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know the origin of the comic but basically it's like in three parts or whatever

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Where someone had basically, was handing something to someone saying, I made this, right?

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And then, but the person takes it and then says, no, I made this

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So basically we considered this the same situation with Starlink

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Right

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Where Ubisoft has made the game and Nintendo has now just taken it and said, no, I made this

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You made this? I made this

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah, yeah, just slapped Star Fox in there and now it's just Star Fox

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's right

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Like, who knows what the game's about

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The question is, is the game any good?

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Who knows, who cares, it's a Star Fox game

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's a Star Fox game now

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
How dare you, don't ask these questions

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Because all of the Nintendo tie-ins have been successful, you know, just like they did with what, the last Skylanders game

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Did you buy it because it had Nintendo tie-ins in it?

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
No

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No, no, I didn't

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Because no one gives a shit about that

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I sure did

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And this is another choice of life game with a Nintendo tie-in that

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You know what else I didn't buy was the one with Gamelan on Philips CD-i

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So not every Nintendo crossover is successful, but some are kind of cool, so you never know

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
We'll see where this one goes, but I think it's pretty much a Star Fox game

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
With some other characters

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I made this

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You don't know

119
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'll let video game realness hold the joke, I'll stop stealing it

120
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
They could have one of Gamelan, Link as a, you know, echo fighter in the next Smash Brothers game

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I just, I think there's like a sense of pride that would never be violated by doing that in Smash Brothers

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I really think so, I think Nintendo would really rather forget that ever happened

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Or Linkette

124
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Stop it right now

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Alright, anyway

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Because like I said earlier, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
vognetwork.com

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

130
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And going into our chat room, Tigerclaw says

131
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Starling on the Switch is basically a new Star Fox game

132
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's exactly what Nintendo wants you to think

133
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's not

134
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Please, stop making excuses for them

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
They need to make their own Star Fox game

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I made this, I made this

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
However though, I'm completely fine with them not making their own F-Zero game

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Because when it was Nintendo and Namco, that turned out just fine

139
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh, that was the Triforce, that was Sega as well, wasn't that too

140
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes, because Sega and Namco both know racing games, Nintendo, they have F-Zero

141
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Nintendo makes great characters, alright anyway

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Tigerclaw says what's interesting though, in the cutscenes that show Star Fox, or excuse me, Fox with a human

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Fox is pretty short, he looks to be about 4 feet tall next to a human

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And S.J. 100 Matt is calling out a few minutes in and Loki is already going after Nintendo

145
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And which I oppose is sorry I'm late

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Anyway, Delvin, I don't mean to take the spotlight off of you and video game realness

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So you've been listening, I know, to OLR for a little while, which you know, thank you very much

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But we got connected back when GamerX was kind of like coming up

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Correct

150
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Because we were trying to find other LGBTQIA plus, you know, all the colors of the rainbow

151
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We were trying to find people to kind of connect with to propose a podcasting panel at GamerX

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Which we did end up doing, but sadly you guys didn't make it to GamerX

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yeah, we couldn't make it out to the

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But at least we still got connected, so that was the important part

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That was the win in that situation, which was really cool

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah, so that was a while ago now

157
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Because they did four years of GamerX and the last GamerX was like two years ago

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So that was like six years ago

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Crazy! So awesome

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Tell me a little bit about why you're a gaming fan

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What do you remember early on that like a gaming memory that made you a gaming fan?

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Well, I got into gaming from a very young age

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I think I was five or six

164
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I got the NES for Christmas

165
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And my sister and I, we didn't really know like what a Nintendo was

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We'd kind of seen it in commercials or whatever

167
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And then we got it for Christmas one year

168
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And so my parents had this one box that we couldn't open

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And so they left it there, and then they gave us this one box to open

170
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If you open that box, Santa's gonna burn down the house

171
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah, kinda

172
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So they gave us this one box to open and it was a joystick

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And so we were like, well, why are you giving us a joystick?

174
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And then we looked at the box and we just started clawing at it

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And we were screaming and going crazy

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And so that was like the moment when gaming started for me essentially

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And they're like, no, I told you not to open it, now you don't get it

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And it turns out the joystick was for a lawnmower that was in the box

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Now go do the chores

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
No, it was a Nintendo in there

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So at that time it was just NES games

182
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We only had Mario

183
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But my aunt, who lived in Texas at the time, had sent us a bunch of games from the US

184
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Because they were a lot cheaper here in the US than it was in Canada

185
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And one of those games that she sent was Mega Man 2

186
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Which is my most favorite game of all time

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I was gonna ask that because I know you're a big Mega Man fan

188
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Like so much that Mega Man appears in your online presence

189
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Correct, my gamertag, Mega Man X400

190
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So tell us a little bit about this Mega Man love

191
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Where does that come from?

192
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It really just started from Mega Man 2

193
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And I've always enjoyed the Mega Man series

194
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It took me forever to actually beat Mega Man 2 as a kid

195
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And then when I finally got it, it just clicked with me

196
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And then that evolved into liking the X series

197
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Which is my favorite of the Mega Man games

198
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Which I've played through all of them

199
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And they're just really fun

200
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And they have great replayability and great challenge

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You can play it in any which way you like

202
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
To make it more difficult if you want

203
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You can try to speedrun it if you want or just play it for shits and giggles

204
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I gotta ask you your thoughts on Mega Man 11

205
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Although you probably haven't really had to play it yet

206
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Because you've been out here, right?

207
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Well I did play the demo

208
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I played the demo at Fan Expo

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Which is a big convention in Toronto

210
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And so that was a lot of fun playing it there

211
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I did get to play some of it on the plane right here

212
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And it's great

213
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Honestly, I think they did a really good job of this game

214
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It was long overdue

215
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Long, long overdue

216
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm glad that they didn't go in the direction they did with Mega Man 9 and 10

217
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
With going back to the old retro design

218
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
They seem to have found a nice hybrid

219
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Maybe it's not retro, but it looks like the old game

220
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
They didn't try to make it ultra fancy or force 3D in it

221
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No, it has a good style to it

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's still in the original Mega Man series

223
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But it is not the old Mega Man 2, 3, 4 style

224
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
With the NES 8-bit style

225
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That they did with 9 and 10

226
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Which I didn't quite like

227
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It now has 4 different difficulty levels

228
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Which I think is really good

229
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It has super beginner, casual, normal, and then hardcore

230
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Wait a minute, so you got hardcore for ultra

231
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Is that going to be your mode at some point?

232
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
No, I'm just normal

233
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So then you have slightly irritating

234
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Which is normal

235
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That would be your mode

236
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So then you have casual

237
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And so then we even have below that Bobby Black Wolf mode

238
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Beginner

239
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
No, it's ok, he's in on the joke

240
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's fine, it's fine

241
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The most basic of basic levels was made for Bobby Black Wolf

242
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And it's fine

243
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So basically what happens in beginner mode is

244
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You almost take no damage

245
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And if you fall, a little bird comes and picks you up

246
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And puts you onto the next platform

247
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So you can just get through the level

248
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Oh my god, I love it

249
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's super easy

250
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Ok, that's awesome

251
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I know one place maybe some of the OLR listeners may have seen you before

252
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
If they don't participate with video game realness right now

253
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
They may be familiar with your Twitch

254
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Because I know you and I have done co-streams

255
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We've done Mario Kart

256
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
We did Mario Kart and we played 20XX

257
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Which is not Mega Man

258
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I remember when I streamed that game for the first time

259
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You came into the chat and you were like

260
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What is this?

261
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I had no idea about the game until I saw you play it

262
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And I purchased it immediately

263
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And it is a really good game

264
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And I generally don't like the

265
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Roguelike style of gaming

266
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Where you have to start all over again

267
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But they do this one in a really good way

268
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That incorporates the Mega Man style of playing

269
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
In with a roguelike

270
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Which is really good

271
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So tell us a little more about your Twitch

272
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You're streaming right?

273
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So I do stream rather passively right now

274
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Because there hasn't been very much games to stream

275
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But there's a whole slew of games coming out

276
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Between now and when Smash Brothers comes out

277
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So you'll be seeing me stream a lot more

278
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
On twitch.tv slash vgrealness

279
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Nice! Love it

280
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And by the way Bobby is speaking up in chat

281
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
He wants us to know

282
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I didn't even beat beginner frown

283
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
There was this one platforming section

284
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That was an autoscroller and I could never get through it

285
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It was the one with destructible blocks

286
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Oh yeah I had that trouble too

287
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Because our Switch controllers

288
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
My kids busted them

289
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Well they're not busted

290
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But they occasionally drift

291
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
For no reason

292
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No it's not even

293
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I don't even think it's the kids that did it

294
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I think it's just their controllers are pieces of shit

295
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Is what it is

296
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I've actually seen a lot on Twitter about like

297
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Cleaning those controllers

298
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
How does dust get in there

299
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
In a way that affects analogies

300
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Because I don't have this problem on any other controller

301
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Oh and then the other thing that was fun

302
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Is my kids wanted to play

303
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Super Mario Party

304
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And so you know I thought

305
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
They had some nice little additional pieces

306
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That they have for the joy cons

307
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
To make them add the little wrist strap

308
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And stuff like that

309
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Those fuckers are nearly impossible to put on

310
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And take off

311
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I don't use them for that reason

312
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What poor fucking design is this shit

313
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Even when you put them on correctly

314
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's just impossible to take them off

315
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
They're pretty tight

316
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Alright anyway what else I want to ask you about

317
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
New games that you're into

318
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So we know about Mega Man

319
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What else, I mean I'll get into your gaming week

320
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So we can talk about specifics because you know we do that here

321
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But like in a general sense what are some of the

322
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Recent games you've really enjoyed

323
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
The one that I've

324
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Played through the most recently was

325
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Octopath Traveler

326
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Which I know a lot of people

327
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's kind of a love hate game

328
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Where you either really got into it because you like that style

329
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Of game

330
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But it is lacking in terms of a continuous story

331
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And character development

332
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I think it really did

333
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Have the design sense

334
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Where it was going to be

335
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Made for a mobile game

336
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That you would purchase in packages

337
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Based on the characters that you purchased

338
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I think, was that your show that got into a discussion

339
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
On that because I think you guys are apps

340
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I heard that on a podcast somewhere about this game was very

341
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Clearly designed for mobile

342
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And I think that is like on the money

343
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I think it was on the money

344
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And they made efforts to kind of

345
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Make character development later on

346
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But it was very tapped on

347
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But that being said, I do love the battle system

348
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That is where the heart of the game is

349
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And how you can

350
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Do the battles and customize your

351
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Jobs

352
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And you get like advanced jobs later

353
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Which just make it even like super easier

354
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And just even talking with friends and like

355
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Finding out how they beep certain bosses

356
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Versus how I did it and just

357
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
There's so many different ways in which you can skin the cat

358
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Basically

359
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Well don't do that

360
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But it's really great

361
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And I'm pretty sure Square Enix will make

362
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
A Octopath Battle 2

363
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It ended up selling like

364
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It was the best seller that month in the US

365
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So I'm sure that game really

366
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Exceeded expectations in the US

367
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Specifically

368
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So there's gonna be like a Deca path

369
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I mean I know Deca is 10

370
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But I think we got into this in a previous episode

371
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But there's going to be a sequel

372
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And that will be good because it will give them a chance to really perfect

373
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Now this formula I think

374
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And the only thing they need to do to make a second game

375
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Good is just a story that continues

376
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And keep everything about the battle system

377
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The same because it's

378
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That we know is not going to be piecemeal like in the story

379
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Correct

380
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Make it a joining story and not just eight

381
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Individual stories about people that

382
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Don't connect

383
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Makes sense

384
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Awesome

385
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Please chime in throughout the night

386
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Tell us what you think about the news

387
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And we're just really happy to have you here

388
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Any social media shout outs to give while you're here?

389
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You can follow us on our Twitter channel

390
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Which is at VG Realness and of course I mentioned

391
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Our Twitch channel

392
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Twitch.tv slash VG Realness

393
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
We do have a YouTube channel as well

394
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Which has like some of our old playthroughs

395
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Because sometimes we would play games

396
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Together as all four of us

397
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Or together

398
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Sometimes me and James would be playing

399
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Final Fantasy 14 so all of our old

400
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Video clips and stuff are on our YouTube

401
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Channel as well which you can just search

402
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Video game realness and it's on there

403
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
They are

404
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I like to think so

405
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm curious though

406
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Am I the first guest you've had

407
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
From Canada?

408
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
In studio

409
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yes

410
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm pretty sure we've had a Skype guest

411
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
From Canada

412
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But in studio

413
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I think we had guys from Vancouver

414
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But as far as in studio

415
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yes

416
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm pretty confident in saying yeah you're the first one from Canada

417
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
If I'm wrong

418
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Dark Tetsuya will correct me shortly

419
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Because he knows this show better than I do

420
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Which is fine

421
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's why we have a wiki

422
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Alright I appreciate that

423
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What is the number one thing

424
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
People in the US should know about Canada

425
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
We don't all say A in a boot

426
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You kind of did though a little bit

427
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You definitely said A

428
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Ok not all of us though

429
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Maybe I did

430
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But not all of us

431
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You know what though good point

432
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Now that I'm thinking about this

433
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I have interviewed people at conventions randomly

434
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And some of them may have been from Canada

435
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But actually sitting in on the show

436
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You've got to be the first

437
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So SJ100Matt says Canada is great

438
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm going up to Toronto later this month

439
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And says poutine is the one thing we should know

440
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm actually very thankful

441
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That you actually brought with you

442
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Ketchup chips

443
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Oh yeah that's right

444
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
No no no

445
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Why not they make sense

446
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You put ketchup on french fries and hash browns

447
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And other potatoes why not put them on chips

448
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I get it

449
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But you know what's funny

450
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I was explaining this to you last night

451
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
We just had this hilarious

452
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
All these stupid differences between the countries

453
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But right now for some reason

454
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
They're selling all dressed chips

455
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Which we don't usually have in the US

456
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
But Ruffles or whatever is doing this

457
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Random ass promotion

458
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I should have also brought you Smarties

459
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The chocolate candy

460
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Not the little tart things

461
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That we associate with

462
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So we have Smarties as something different

463
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Completely in Canada

464
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And then I think the things

465
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
That you call Smarties we call pop rockets

466
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Or something I can't quite recall

467
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Because I'm not that candy person

468
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Alright good to know

469
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
D'artizia in chat is confirming

470
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm pretty sure he's the first Canadian we know

471
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
That's actually on the show

472
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
The ambassador to Canada

473
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Delvin is here with us tonight

474
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yes queen

475
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Alright let's get into our kickoff topic tonight

476
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Which has to do with movies movies movies

477
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Like this week it just seems like

478
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
All these video games suddenly

479
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Want to turn into movies

480
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Loki you want to tell us a little more about

481
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
What's going on this week with Hollywood's recent

482
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Obsession with adapting more video games

483
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
When, correct me if I'm wrong

484
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Video game adaptations

485
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Like some have done okay

486
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You know like Resident Evil

487
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
They've made how many of those movies

488
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Because I think they do very well on Blu Ray

489
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And home video and you know cult type of things

490
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You know with the horror crowd

491
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I know there's definitely a huge fandom of Resident Evil

492
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And so forth so I think those movies have done

493
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Okay but like I'm not thinking of like

494
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You know how like when there's a big

495
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Big movie like let's say Titanic

496
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Right then suddenly Hollywood is like

497
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What are all the other disasters in

498
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
History we need to suddenly make

499
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
A movie or or um

500
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Titanic did well well then we need to remake

501
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The Poseidon adventure right away

502
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Right like Hollywood has this

503
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Obsession with if one thing is big

504
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So I'm trying to like

505
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
They have this obsession with we run out of ideas

506
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And so now let's

507
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah we gotta remake everything

508
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Scrape that barrel until there's no barrel left

509
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Although I'm gonna get this off my chest

510
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Right now because while many of you were

511
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Seeing Venom in the theaters this weekend

512
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
My ass was there opening night to see

513
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
A Star is Born with Lady Gaga

514
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The fourth remake of that movie

515
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And all I'm gonna say is

516
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yes queen

517
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Well all I'm saying is yes I am

518
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Seeing Venom next week

519
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
No I don't really care to see it but it's a

520
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Free movie my dad wants to hang out so

521
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Sure

522
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
There's nothing else playing he's like

523
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So you don't wanna go see A Star is Born like no

524
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's so good

525
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I cried so much

526
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
She's queening out

527
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Anyway no but my point is

528
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Not every remake

529
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But the thing about

530
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Not to get too far this is a video game show but the thing about

531
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Star is Born is that

532
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
The one in the 50's is about

533
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Hollywood acting this one is very much about

534
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Music making because obviously that's what Gaga

535
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Does so it's like Grammys

536
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But anyway

537
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I can save that for another podcast

538
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Let's talk about my point with this whole thing

539
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Was why is Hollywood suddenly obsessed

540
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
With we've gotta make a video game

541
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Movie because we have so many of them just coming out

542
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I think because they're doing like well this

543
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Is kind of Konami a little bit you know they're

544
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Doing I think they have had some

545
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Success with Castlevania as a series

546
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And so now they're like yeah sure

547
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You can make our properties into

548
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Things so like first off we've got Dance Dance

549
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Revolution being adapted

550
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
To something

551
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
What is there to adapt? Look

552
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Well here's what they're saying and this

553
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
This is gonna be like

554
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Real quick real quick cause I wanna address the

555
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
First question before we move on about like what is

556
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Hollywood's obsession right now with this

557
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Tigerclaw says movies based on video games are

558
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Usually a hit or miss it depends on the source

559
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Material some video game movies are better than

560
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Others because they're closer to the source material

561
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Than others Tomb Raider for example

562
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That was a good video game movie I forgot

563
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That was pretty recent but I didn't think that

564
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
One made I mean I didn't see the movie

565
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I heard it was actually like decent

566
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It was like it didn't it didn't like

567
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Make a tragedy of the game or anything like it was

568
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
A good adaptation but I don't think it made

569
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Shit tons of money

570
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Like I don't even know if it made its budget back

571
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
But anyway like that's

572
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Like a kind of a recent thing that

573
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Came up so anyway sorry so

574
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
DDR where are we going with this

575
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
No we're good

576
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Unfortunately so basically

577
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Here is how

578
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
They summarize it

579
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The project will explore a world

580
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
On the brink of destruction where only

581
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
The only hope is to unite

582
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Through the universal language

583
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Of dance

584
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Fucking stupid

585
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Um and since I know

586
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
A lot of people playing the home game are probably

587
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Shouting various other movies that

588
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Have been about DDR in the past

589
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
We have things like DDR the movie so we have

590
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The FP La Machina

591
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
De Bailar a failed

592
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
DDR movie script floating around for the 2000s

593
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That's what Rama says in chat at live.vognetwork.com

594
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Um so this isn't necessarily

595
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
The first movie about DDR

596
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But I mean here's the thing like

597
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I I'm gonna say something y'all might

598
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Not like but those movies even though

599
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
They're DDR inspired they're not

600
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Dance Dance Revolution the movie

601
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
They're more about you know

602
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Community DDR is kind of a plot device

603
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So to speak

604
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And I'm fine with it being a plot device

605
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And honestly this sounds more like something

606
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
That would you know lend itself better to like

607
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
An animation or something like some

608
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Some kid wants a

609
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You know make it to like the

610
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Grand chan- who cares make the stakes

611
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Lower and just like you know

612
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Talk about like the community

613
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Or something but like instead they're going with

614
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Fucking apocalypse it's always a

615
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Fucking apocalypse of some sort and

616
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
This doesn't it doesn't lend

617
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Itself you can't have like

618
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Hey guys you know what

619
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
The step up series is doing fucking great

620
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Let's make a movie where we

621
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Save the world from an apocalypse with

622
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It's fucking stupid it sounds

623
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Stupid with an established franchise like that

624
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
And now we're gonna do something different

625
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
The only way

626
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
That Emmy could save the world

627
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Was to get a triple A on

628
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Brilliant to You

629
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
This is what I'm gonna

630
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Say there's no fucking story in

631
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
DDR so I don't understand like why they're

632
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Gonna do movies so in my opinion

633
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And that's my opinion is that

634
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
If they're gonna do a DDR movie

635
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It needs to have two things

636
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It needs to have some scene where

637
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Arrows go up the screen if arrows do not

638
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Go up the screen at some point in the movie

639
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Fail. Number two that

640
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Soundtrack better be the

641
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Cheesiest fucking 90s euro dance

642
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I have heard in my entire

643
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Life because if skill

644
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Rex is on that album throw it in

645
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
The garbage

646
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
My guess is that with

647
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
The uniting of the world

648
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
With dance is that it's gonna

649
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Incorporate different types

650
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Of music and dance and then the arrows

651
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Will be the language in which they speak

652
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So there will be arrows

653
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
On the screen but they'll

654
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
That will be their way of communicating

655
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Will the arrows make a heart at some point?

656
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Yes and a giant heart

657
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And then it will save the world

658
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Sailor Moon style

659
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Like the only way that this is like

660
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Sounds any like a plausible

661
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Thing like to use like music to

662
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Save the world type thing it sounds like

663
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Matt Cross 7

664
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Or 2 or I don't remember which

665
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Matt Cross series they had where I think it was

666
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
7 where they had like the rock band and

667
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
They were fighting actually with music and stuff

668
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Matt Cross 2 I didn't watch any of those I just

669
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Remember the figures for them

670
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So that's the only way I could

671
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
See that something like that if you want to fight

672
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
With like music or something but other than that I just don't

673
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
See how this could be a thing

674
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
It's gonna be garbage

675
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It's a movie called Dance Dance Revolution

676
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
That might have like

677
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
One throw it like do you remember

678
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
When they made a battleship movie?

679
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
With Rihanna in it

680
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I've talked about this on a show before

681
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I know I have it was fucking terrible yeah

682
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
That's the thing I said if that movie

683
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Did not have a scene with Liam Neeson

684
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Going you suck my battleship

685
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Then it's not a battleship game

686
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And they have the pegs they have the pegs in there too

687
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And that was great I saw it in the trailer

688
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm like this is stupid but that's the thing

689
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You know it's stupid and that's what you

690
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Go to see is stupid and guess what they're

691
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Delivering stupid so

692
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I will say

693
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Dance is kind of big right now like

694
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
That World of Dance show on NBC

695
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Have you like seen some of that like

696
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Like I gotta say like some of the

697
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Like cause you know I love

698
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Emotional porn on Facebook right

699
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Like I will watch those auditions

700
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
With like the little girl that like

701
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Breaks this on and then all the judges start crying

702
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And then I'm crying and we're all crying

703
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And it's like 1 am and I'm not in bed yet

704
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It's not gonna be that

705
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But I'm saying dance is big right now cause that World of Dance show

706
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Is actually has a lot of that

707
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And then what just tonight

708
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
They've got Dancing with the Stars with

709
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Little kids for some reason

710
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I don't know with Honey Boo Boo

711
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Dancing with the Stars is tonight

712
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Oh wait is she actually on it?

713
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Yeah Honey Boo Boo is on it

714
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
She must be much older now

715
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Like what is she grown up all the way

716
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Yeah but you know gotta get those paychecks

717
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Still rolling in like you know

718
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
That show went off the air how many years ago

719
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
So gotta pay for college

720
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
That kid will go to any college she wants

721
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So anyway

722
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Dance is big right now so why not

723
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I just don't have high expectations

724
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Whatever the hell they put in the theater so I don't really care

725
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Sorry I gotta say Bobby Blackwoven

726
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Chat after I talked about Honey Boo Boo

727
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Bobby Blackwoven chats like

728
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Delvin's like well OLR was fun but you

729
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Got a TV right

730
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I love it

731
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I love it alright so enough

732
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Enough Dance Dance Revolution so

733
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
That may be a thing we'll see

734
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I think if it's gonna suck this

735
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Especially since what? It's like

736
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's not necessarily like

737
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
This would have been like something to do

738
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
A decade or so ago

739
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Like when it was like super popular

740
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Now it's not super popular

741
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You've missed your boat

742
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Here's the thing and I want you all to know

743
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I love dance you might think I'm excited

744
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
About a DDR movie I'm not

745
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I love Dance Dance Revolution

746
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
This show wouldn't exist if it wasn't for

747
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
DDR in the community but when I heard

748
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
The movie the news about the movie and this

749
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Whole plot and everything I'm that lady

750
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
In the matrix and you've all seen this

751
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Youtuber gif I don't remember her name

752
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
But you see her and she's looking and she knows

753
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
About to get unplugged she's gonna die she's going

754
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Not like this not like this

755
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And that's how I'm looking

756
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
At this DDR movie not like

757
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
This is not where I would not like this

758
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Anyway

759
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
What else is gonna get ruined?

760
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Well let's see the next

761
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Step on the list is

762
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Monster Hunter the movie

763
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Alright Monster Hunter that's a popular

764
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Series let's see how we're

765
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Gonna fuck this one up

766
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Well the movie plot centers

767
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
On the leader of a UN military

768
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Team named Artemis played

769
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Oh but it's got Milaj

770
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Um Jovanovich so

771
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Milajovic Jovanovich yeah whatever

772
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You know why she's in it

773
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Because it's just gonna be garbage

774
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Better than that who's directing it

775
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Oh her husband

776
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Yeah so

777
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Whatever you know what it's fine I can see

778
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
This being like a schlocky

779
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It's a great Hollywood love story

780
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
If we're gonna flop we're gonna flop together

781
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
So it's alright

782
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's transported into another realm populated by

783
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Monsters where she meets a hunter

784
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Jai

785
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
With two team

786
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Or two of them teaming up to close the portal

787
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
To prevent monsters from attacking Earth

788
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Doesn't sound like Monster Hunter

789
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
But you know what though

790
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Yeah Darkest Season chat says are we sure this is a Monster Hunter movie

791
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
It's what it is

792
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It does have the video game director

793
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Doing it and it's got the name

794
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So

795
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I mean there's monsters in it and there might be

796
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Four people trying to take down the monster

797
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Honestly though but here's why

798
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Like think about it this is why that they're gonna

799
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Let them do this

800
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Look at how much money Capcom probably made

801
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
From the Resident Evil movie franchise

802
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And let's be honest the Resident Evil movies

803
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
They're not high caliber

804
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
They were just

805
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
They're entertaining popcorn films

806
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
That's what I see this as

807
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
That's what I see this as

808
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Instead of it being zombies

809
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It's just gonna be fucking monsters now

810
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And it's the same shit

811
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Because she's a

812
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
UN military person so it's basically

813
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Her fucking character from

814
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
The Resident Evil movies

815
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Just thrown into a whole other fucking universe

816
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
With CGI monsters that says

817
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
CGI zombies

818
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I will say out of the movies

819
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
The games becoming movies Monster Hunter is the one that

820
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Kinda makes the most sense

821
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Honestly like if you're gonna make

822
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
It become a movie like Monster Hunter I'm like

823
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Okay well that's not like DDR

824
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
You know that has at least a plot

825
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Or like some sort of a story

826
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Monsters being hunted okay

827
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I'm with you

828
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It's basic but I got it

829
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Godzilla was a monster being hunted

830
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Oh good point good point

831
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Well Hollywood loves a monster movie

832
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And of course since

833
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Capcom's sense is hmm there's

834
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Money to be made from our franchises

835
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
We tried Street Fighter that didn't work

836
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Out so well a few times

837
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
We are trying uh we tried

838
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Resident Evil that worked out let's go with that

839
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Monster Hunter? Possibly

840
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
How about we fuck over Mega Man

841
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Again he's not quite dead

842
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Yet with the animated series

843
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
No because I'm counting the animated series

844
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
With that have you watched the animated series?

845
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Absolutely not it's pretty garbage

846
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
It's not that bad

847
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Our Resident Mega Man fan says

848
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It's not that bad

849
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
But it's not that good either

850
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
That saw that there's a tiny Mega Man

851
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
That's living inside of Mega Man's head

852
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Yes I'm sorry that's it's terrible

853
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It's fucking garbage

854
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It's fucking garbage and like

855
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
They should do it in a way they're gonna do

856
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
An animated series of Mega Man and they wanna

857
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Be silly like that then do it like the

858
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Fucking Teen Titans series

859
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I mean Teen Titans Go just do it like that

860
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Where it's self

861
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Referential and just silly

862
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Oh wait were you talking about the new Mega Man

863
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
The new one okay sorry no

864
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I was referring to the old one

865
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Oh no no the old one

866
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
That's fine that was a long time ago we made

867
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Our mistakes back then

868
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Yeah I was referring to the old one

869
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
No I'm talking about the new Mega Man

870
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
No no no no

871
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
No new Mega Man series yeah

872
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So they're thinking

873
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
About doing and not necessarily

874
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
An animated Mega Man series

875
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
A live action Mega Man

876
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Film

877
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
That makes me very nervous

878
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Based on the influential and globally

879
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Beloved Mega Man franchise

880
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Capcom aims to appeal

881
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
To a diverse audience

882
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Including not only game players

883
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
But action movie fans

884
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
As well you know this

885
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Is how we get this right here

886
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Is how we get that prototype of Mega Man

887
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
That fucking was scrapped and you know the one that looked like

888
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Bomberman Act Zero that bullshit

889
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Oh yeah that's how we get this shit

890
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Yeah I was still

891
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Watch it though

892
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Every day I hear about the Sonic the Hedgehog movie

893
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I'm just like going

894
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I will watch that because Jim Carrey's in it

895
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And that's the only reason why

896
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Is going to be a mess

897
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Is going to be a mess

898
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I'm a little worried when they say live action

899
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Because immediately I get the picture

900
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
The cover art of Mega Man 2

901
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
In my head

902
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
With the human Mega Man

903
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And that just terrifies me to see that

904
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
But what if that human Mega Man is played by none other than

905
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Nathan Fillion

906
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Who's going to play Mega Man?

907
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Oh I imagine if Mega Man is a boy

908
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
They're going to get a child actor to play Mega Man

909
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And they'll probably humanize

910
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Like I don't think Mega Man will look so

911
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Roboty but Mega Man will look like

912
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
A little kid but maybe with like

913
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
An arm that shoots lasers

914
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
We'll get none other than child actor

915
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Macaulay Culkin

916
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
He's in his 30s I mean like

917
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
He was a child actor at one time

918
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
That's still

919
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
That's like the whole thing where I'm like wait a minute

920
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I'm still voicing Sora

921
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Okay that's going to be interesting

922
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Because Sora's going to be very much an adult now

923
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Because Haley Joel Osment's

924
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I don't know if y'all know

925
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
But since Kingdom Hearts

926
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
The last game was like 15 years ago

927
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Haley Joel Osment is not a kid anymore

928
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I don't know if y'all know

929
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
He a very grown man now

930
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I don't know if y'all have heard

931
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But a lot of those kid actors have grown up

932
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Like that kid who played Anakin

933
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
In the first Star Wars movie

934
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And he also was like you know what

935
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Acting is not for me because people are fucking me

936
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Because you know people were really fucking rude to him

937
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Because they blamed

938
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
The failures of episode one on

939
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
What a seven year old boy

940
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Because that's a rational thing to do

941
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Anyway

942
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Who knows it's George Lucas come on

943
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Let's see

944
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Looking in chat over at

945
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Live.vog at Network.com

946
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Dungeon Buster says I've seen artists try to make Mega Man

947
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Look realistic

948
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
One box art did not turn out well

949
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
The only positive

950
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I think there's a way to make Mega Man not look

951
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
He just won't look like the robot

952
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Except maybe in like one scene

953
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
The only positive I have here

954
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Because I'm a fan of his as well

955
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Is that it's being produced

956
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I guess

957
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Along with Masaoka

958
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Which was the guy from Heroes

959
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
That was the guy in Heroes

960
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
He's like kind of helping shape this

961
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Okay you have my attention

962
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
He's kind of a geeky guy that I feel

963
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Has probably actually played Mega Man

964
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I played Mega Man

965
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
So I'm hopeful

966
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Okay

967
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Once again though

968
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
We'll put that in column A

969
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I will see it no matter how garbage it is

970
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Just so I can complain about it

971
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I think it has potential

972
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
To be really good if they

973
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Went the X series route

974
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
As opposed to the original Mega Man

975
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
But it would be weird for them to jump

976
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
To the X series

977
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And not start at the beginning for people who've never

978
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Played Mega Man before

979
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
So it's

980
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Either here or there

981
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I think it would actually be

982
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Like you guys are going to disagree with me

983
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But I think it would be very smart of them

984
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Like if they want to make a good movie

985
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
They're going to really keep the references to the games

986
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Very light

987
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Like there will be a Mega Man

988
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
There will be a Dr. Light

989
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And a Dr. Wily

990
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
But maybe it's not like

991
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
You just described the game

992
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I know but like it's not like

993
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Levels

994
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
It's just going to be like

995
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Maybe it's like Scott Pilgrim

996
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I would be fine with Scott Pilgrim

997
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Type of movie

998
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
He's got to find these other kids that are actually

999
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
The creations of Dr. Wily

1000
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Yeah exactly

1001
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Now that I'd be okay with

1002
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Going to chat at

1003
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Live.vognetwork.com

1004
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And SS200Matt says at the end they will say

1005
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
He is a Mega Man

1006
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Cause you know we all

1007
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Y'all love it when somebody in the movie

1008
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Says the title of the movie

1009
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Roll credits

1010
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Yeah got it

1011
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
There you go

1012
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Three video game movies

1013
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Coming soon

1014
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Maybe not that soon

1015
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Eventually

1016
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Let's move on into some

1017
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
How was your gaming week and the types of video games

1018
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
That you've been playing this week

1019
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Loki we'll start with you

1020
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I played Forza Horizon 4

1021
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So I played through a little bit of that

1022
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I

1023
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Don't know what I'm

1024
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I'm probably training my

1025
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Dryvatars badly

1026
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Because I'm not on the roads most of the time

1027
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I'm just going everywhere else

1028
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
But

1029
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Yeah it's a very pretty game

1030
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It runs really nice on my laptop

1031
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
So I'm happy about that

1032
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Um

1033
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Then I did play a little bit of

1034
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
DDR

1035
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Ace

1036
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I went to the arcades actually

1037
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I've been meaning to go over there and play for like a long time

1038
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
But the problem is it's like so packed over there

1039
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Dave and Busters

1040
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
That can never really get on the machine

1041
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Especially since there's fuckers that like to

1042
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Camp on the machine all day long

1043
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
It's like don't you have school or something?

1044
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I mean like shouldn't you be

1045
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
In a job? I don't know

1046
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
But so I did that

1047
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And then you know other arcade games with the Golf Land

1048
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Because I had to keep my son

1049
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Away from my other son

1050
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Because my other son was sick

1051
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And so that means I had to take him out of the house the entire day

1052
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So that was pretty much

1053
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Saturday all arcade day

1054
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So we were playing different arcade games

1055
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I got to play the giant

1056
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Space Invaders game

1057
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Which meh

1058
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Mario Kart was pretty fun

1059
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Played a little bit of that

1060
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And very sad

1061
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
That I saw the

1062
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
DDR Max 2 machine

1063
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
That's at

1064
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Roosevelt Golf Land

1065
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And it is a sad, it's off

1066
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And it's a very sad sight

1067
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I didn't take Delvin to Golf Land while he's here

1068
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
For a reason, I was just like you know it's skippable

1069
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
It's um

1070
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
The golf course is nice

1071
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
We went and played mini golf, they have it all decorated for Halloween

1072
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
So that's kind of cool

1073
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
The only way to fixing their machines up is

1074
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
They don't give a shit

1075
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
As long as the ticket spitters are working

1076
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Then they don't give a shit about anything else

1077
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
But it was a sad sight

1078
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Do you have mini golf in Canada?

1079
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
We do

1080
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Well then yeah, there's no point

1081
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
And then what else?

1082
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
So

1083
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Pokemon Go

1084
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And

1085
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Just

1086
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Yeah, that's pretty much it

1087
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I didn't get the chance to play Super Mario Party

1088
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Because my kids basically have been

1089
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
You know, monopolizing the Switch

1090
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
And

1091
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I didn't bother to purchase Spiderman

1092
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Because my wife's monopolizing the TV

1093
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
To watch a stupid baking show that she could watch

1094
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Oh, the Great British Bake Off?

1095
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Oh good times, love that show

1096
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
It's a great show, but I wish I could have the TV once in a while

1097
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Has she watched Nailed It?

1098
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Because that's another great one

1099
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
You know what, I set up a TV in our bedroom

1100
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
She's like, I want to watch Netflix in bed

1101
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Okay, cool, set up the old TV in the bedroom

1102
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
With the Netflix box

1103
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Watch your fucking baking show in here

1104
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Then I can play on the 4K TV

1105
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
That we bought with my nice 4K system

1106
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
To play some 4K games

1107
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Nope!

1108
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Gotta fucking watch the goddamn baking show in 4K instead

1109
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It's like, ugh

1110
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
We need to see every detail on those cakes

1111
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And they are fucking delicious looking

1112
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
No fault of that show

1113
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It's just, it's

1114
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
It's everything

1115
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Uh, Delvin, I'll let you go next

1116
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Because I know we have a little bit of overlap

1117
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
So I'll let you, you know, I can always just talk about 4

1118
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
How was your gaming week, Delvin?

1119
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Um, so

1120
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
For the past week and a bit

1121
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Uh, I just recently got back

1122
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Into playing World of Warcraft

1123
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I'm back on my bullshit again

1124
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Of playing World of Warcraft

1125
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Uh, so

1126
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Any fans listening from

1127
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Video gaming will just know that I

1128
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Swore that I was not going to play

1129
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Uh

1130
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I'm right there with you

1131
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I swore, I'm like, nope, not going to play this expansion

1132
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I'm done, I'm not playing World of Warcraft anymore

1133
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And then

1134
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I blame Cameron

1135
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Because he started playing

1136
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And we're basically, we enable each other

1137
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
One of us will start playing

1138
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And then enable the other person

1139
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
To start playing

1140
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It's kind of like the friendship Shane and I have

1141
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
And so

1142
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Not totally his fault, but then another friend

1143
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Was playing too, and I was like, okay, well, fuck

1144
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
The band's getting back together again

1145
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
So I don't want to be the one left out

1146
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Uh, so I got back

1147
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Playing about a week and a half ago

1148
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
And power leveled all the way

1149
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
To 120, and then started

1150
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Grinding through dungeons, mythic bluses

1151
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Raiding, and

1152
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I'm such a

1153
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Nerd that, you know, the raid

1154
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Resets are on the Tuesday

1155
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Right. So

1156
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Tuesday night, uh

1157
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I did all my raiding for one week

1158
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Because I was leaving

1159
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Yeah. Wednesday

1160
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
So Tuesday I did

1161
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
All of normal raid

1162
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And I did a bit of heroic with

1163
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
My guild

1164
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And did some, like I did everything that I needed to do

1165
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
For the week, I did the mythic plus, so I would get something

1166
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
In my box for the week

1167
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And all of it

1168
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And so that was my gaming week mostly

1169
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Um, I also, like I did mention

1170
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Bonds006 says you did not want to be the diva

1171
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Holding out to get the band

1172
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Get together. Exactly. You did not want to be

1173
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Posh Spice. No. You did not want to be the hold out

1174
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Exactly. So I was like

1175
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Whatever. I've been playing for

1176
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Ten years, what's, what's another

1177
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Year? Right? So who cares?

1178
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Um, and uh

1179
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I did play some Mega Man

1180
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Um, and that, and of course Pokemon Go

1181
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
A lot, uh, we've been playing over

1182
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
The weekend. Yeah, we were hanging with Dark

1183
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Sakura yesterday actually, since obviously

1184
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
She's not available on Sundays, so we kind of spent yesterday

1185
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
With her so you could meet her. Um, and then we

1186
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Ended up, she did not have Mewtwo yet

1187
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And it was like, me, you, her

1188
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
And Allen like all play, so I was like

1189
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Okay, we have four people together, where's the Mewtwo

1190
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
At? And we're like, maybe somebody will be

1191
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
There if we get there right at Hatch, and sure enough

1192
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
We, and there was this couple, walked

1193
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Right up when we did, and it was like, oh good

1194
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
We were hoping other people would be here, so like between the six

1195
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Of us, actually no, there was a seventh account

1196
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
A mysterious seventh

1197
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Player. Possible Spoofer

1198
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
But thank you Spoofer

1199
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Yeah, cause we took that one down, and then we did the other one

1200
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
At the bridge. Yes. Which, like

1201
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
The same thing happened. We're like, where are they?

1202
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And I looked over and I'm like, that dude's on his phone over there

1203
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Yeah. That's the other guy

1204
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
So I, it's, so, it's funny

1205
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
We're talking about the Mewtwo

1206
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I have done, probably about

1207
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Eight Mewtwo raids

1208
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Uh, between here and back in Toronto

1209
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And, not for the life of me could I catch

1210
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
More than one god damn Mewtwo

1211
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So I did catch one here, and

1212
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
So now I have two, but that's it

1213
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Yeah. And it's hard now to get

1214
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
To find Mewtwo raids back

1215
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
In Toronto because it seems like

1216
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Once the initial rush of

1217
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Mewtwo coming out was done

1218
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Nobody's doing raids anymore

1219
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I find that people still want to do them

1220
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I mean, it might be harder, especially in like

1221
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Less trafficked areas to find the people

1222
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
But people still generally want to do them

1223
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Because they're really good experience

1224
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And it's the only way you can get rare candy and items

1225
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
So you might as well use your free pass

1226
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
For the day if you can get a group

1227
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
You might as well do it, there's no harm in doing it

1228
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I did, I did join, uh

1229
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
There's a discord group, uh, for the Toronto

1230
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Area for Pokemon Go

1231
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
So, I'm gonna utilize that a bit more

1232
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Now that we're starting to get into the colder

1233
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Months in Toronto

1234
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
It's a lot harder to get people to do raids

1235
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Unless you actually coordinate

1236
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Well plus, load up on Trashymon here

1237
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
In California, and then when you go back

1238
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
You could just be like, does anyone want to do distance trading

1239
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Cause it's, it's like 3000 kilometers

1240
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Cause like, when I open my Alolan

1241
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Eggs, I'm very particular

1242
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I will tend to, so like

1243
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
This is why if you're on my friends list

1244
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
And you're somewhere on the east coast, like I've been opening

1245
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Your presence a lot more lately

1246
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Like, if you're like Atlanta

1247
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Toronto, or I've got a little group

1248
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
There's like some New York, some New Jersey, I'm like kinda

1249
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Figuring out who's where, I'm opening those gifts

1250
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
When I have the holes in my inventory for Alolan eggs

1251
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Because if nothing else, if I get another fucking

1252
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Sandshrew or Grimer or something

1253
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I can trade it for a hella distance

1254
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And I think they're doing the same thing with my eggs

1255
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Because then the eggs in the west coast

1256
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
You can at least trade for distance

1257
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
And get that medal, which you know

1258
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
The medal doesn't really mean anything, it's just EP

1259
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
No, but for the people that are in those

1260
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Type of Discord groups, they want

1261
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
They're full completionists, you know

1262
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
They're checking their IVs, they're doing badges and medals

1263
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And things like that, so, it helps

1264
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Yeah, so, cool

1265
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Um, and then I think it's also fun to have

1266
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Pokemon from like, other places

1267
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Like, so now you have a Mewtwo from Sacramento

1268
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
That will like, kinda remind you of that day

1269
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Oh yes, absolutely

1270
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Just like, my one and only Regirock

1271
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Is from Atlanta

1272
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
So during Dragon Con, that was the only time I was actually able to

1273
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Capture Regirock, but then I also go

1274
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
That was the time I got Bobby Blackwolf to actually

1275
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Do a Pokemon raid, so that's like

1276
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
You know, like, woo, we got a little memory there

1277
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And then we traded Unknown today

1278
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And it became Lucky

1279
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Yeah, Lucky you

1280
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Yeah, he got the Lucky D

1281
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Because I gave him one of the Unknown, I got a Dragon Con

1282
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Because I saved like, you know, I basically

1283
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Don't have an Unknown yet here, here you go

1284
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
You don't have one yet

1285
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Oh, really?

1286
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Remind me next episode, I'll get you one

1287
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So, then what left, you got the Lucky Unknown

1288
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
But because you were like, what do you want

1289
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I'm like, my Contodex is done

1290
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
There's like, literally nothing, just give me trash

1291
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
So you gave me a Pidgey

1292
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I got a Lucky Pidgey

1293
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
It's because you haven't gotten enough Lucky

1294
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Stuff yet

1295
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
The first few trades you do

1296
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Like, first 10 trades are gonna be Lucky

1297
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
So whatever I get from you is gonna be Lucky

1298
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
So, yeah

1299
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Anyway, so that was, that was a little irritating

1300
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
But anyway

1301
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Well, max out that Pidgey then

1302
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Yeah, you know what, actually because

1303
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
When they're Lucky, they get good stats

1304
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And this guy is a 15 Attack

1305
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
15 Defense

1306
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
So I'm like, well, if nothing else, he might just

1307
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Be a funny Gym Defender

1308
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
If nothing else, like,

1309
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Why not?

1310
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
He'll be half price to level him up to

1311
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Level him up a little bit and throw him in a gym somewhere

1312
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Anyway, my game of the week, so I've been playing

1313
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Not just World of Warcraft

1314
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I'm not on the raiding thing

1315
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And I don't think I will be

1316
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
But I just enjoy, like, the

1317
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
World quests, just the leveling up

1318
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Experience, I started a new

1319
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Monk, just because I wanted to

1320
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Level up again, it seems like they fixed

1321
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
A lot of the level sinking dungeons thing

1322
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Because when that patch first went in, I was pissed

1323
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I was not having a good time

1324
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
But now it seems it's fine now

1325
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I did, okay, so the day that

1326
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Patch went in that rescaled

1327
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
The old world where all the dungeons were 1-60

1328
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I went in and I got

1329
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Dire Maul or something, and it was

1330
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
It was a shit show, because

1331
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
People were not used to it the new way

1332
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And it was impossible to heal

1333
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
So you could get

1334
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Dungeons that were

1335
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
For level 60 at level 20?

1336
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
No, they would still unlock later

1337
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
My panda shaman

1338
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Was level 50, but we got that

1339
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
But other people that were higher

1340
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Would get sinked down, like for example

1341
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I'm level 27, and I just queued for

1342
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Dungeon, I got Wailing Caverns at

1343
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
27, but I was scaled down

1344
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
To what a player in Wailing Caverns would be

1345
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Which is kind of like the 14 system

1346
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
A little bit, it's this weird

1347
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Weird iteration of it, whereas like

1348
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
14 just straight up level sinks you

1349
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It's a little different in a while

1350
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
But anyway, I've been playing a lot of

1351
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Forza Horizon 4, I did a stream of that earlier

1352
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
This week, and that game is fun

1353
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Forza is so extra

1354
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
That's the greatest thing about it, and I love that

1355
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
My character is named Potato

1356
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And they actually say, okay Potato

1357
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Do you want to go get some new influence?

1358
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Okay Potato, it's great to meet you Potato

1359
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Potato, we're gonna need you in a movie

1360
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So I just love that they call me Potato

1361
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Why do they call you Potato?

1362
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Because I ask them to

1363
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Because the game has

1364
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
All these names loaded into it

1365
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
They always call me Matt

1366
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Okay, here's the funny thing

1367
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I think it reads your Xbox profile

1368
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Because when I started the full game

1369
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
They were like, do you want us to call you Rob?

1370
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
And I was like

1371
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Let me see what the other names are

1372
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
And the first page is all like

1373
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Quote unquote normal names

1374
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
And they have a pretty impressive list

1375
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Of like 300 names

1376
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Sadly, not everybody's name is gonna be in there

1377
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Yeah, Delvin's not gonna be in there

1378
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
If you have a unique name, it's not gonna be in there

1379
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Sorry, but if your name isn't in there

1380
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Then you go to page 2, which is

1381
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Nicknames

1382
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
And there's all these different nicknames that they'll call you

1383
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
So you can pick one

1384
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I don't know if they'll call you Mega Ma'am

1385
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I bet Mega is one of the names that they'll call you

1386
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
And one of the names that was in there was Potato

1387
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
So I was doing the stream

1388
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I was like

1389
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Perfect, that's a perfect name for me, Potato

1390
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Can I change that?

1391
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
You can change it

1392
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
You go into the menu and it's

1393
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Right where you pick your car

1394
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Wherever you customize your character

1395
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
It's in the menu, it's not hard to miss

1396
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And you change it at any time

1397
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
So if I feel like I don't want them to call me Potato anymore

1398
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
But it's all voice acted

1399
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Like when I say they call me Potato

1400
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
The voice acting says it

1401
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
It's not just the text in the game

1402
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Naming your character in an RPG

1403
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Like butts, so that you make all the characters say

1404
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Get over here, butts

1405
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
And all that stuff, right?

1406
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Anyway

1407
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
But Fours is fun

1408
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I'm not quite in the open world yet

1409
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I don't really give my full thoughts because

1410
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I'm still making my way through the season

1411
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I didn't realize I'm not in the open world

1412
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I thought I was

1413
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
There's like a pre-open world

1414
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
So like you're still seeing everything

1415
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Like the other people and stuff

1416
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
But I noticed today there were way less

1417
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
People in there than there were when

1418
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
The day the game came out

1419
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Because more people have gotten through it

1420
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
So they're in the real open world now

1421
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I guess I should play through the game then

1422
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
The seasons are on a fixed schedule

1423
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
The schedule will change when you start

1424
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
So it basically forces you to go

1425
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
So the very first thing in the game

1426
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
You play all the seasons in rapid succession

1427
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
That's just to get you a taste, right?

1428
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
But then when you start the game it's like, okay

1429
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
It's autumn, go do this race, this race, and this race

1430
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And then it's gonna be winter

1431
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
And then get this many fans

1432
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And it will be, you know, I'm assuming spring

1433
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
And then summer

1434
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Once you get through all four seasons

1435
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Then you'll go into the real game mode

1436
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Where the seasons rotate like once a week

1437
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Like a real game week

1438
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
So I think they had winter last week

1439
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
So I would imagine it's spring in game right now

1440
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Or it's gonna turn to spring on Friday

1441
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And then that's when you're like racing

1442
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
With other people and doing those events

1443
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Everybody's kind of on the same clock, so to speak

1444
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
So, there's that

1445
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Yeah, gosh, I don't know what else to say

1446
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
About Forza

1447
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
If you think you might enjoy a new

1448
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Type of racing game, I urge you to check out the demo

1449
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I think Forza is one of the must-own

1450
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Titles on Xbox One

1451
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
It honestly, in my opinion, is Microsoft's

1452
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Best exclusive right now

1453
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And yes, I'm including Halo

1454
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Fight me

1455
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
So, Forza Horizon

1456
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Is Microsoft's best exclusive right now

1457
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And maybe I'll change my mind on that later

1458
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
But these are must-have games if you own

1459
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
An Xbox One

1460
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
And even if you don't own an Xbox One, the great thing is

1461
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
They're on PC

1462
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
That's where I got mine, I don't need an Xbox One

1463
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
That's the reason I got rid of my Xbox One

1464
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
All the Xbox One games I wanted to play

1465
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Were all on PC, so I was like

1466
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Okay, well, time to get a PS4, and I traded it in

1467
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Yeah, so, I mean

1468
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Yeah, and I bought it

1469
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Digitally, so you get the whole like

1470
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I have it on PC, and if I want to

1471
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Play it on my Xbox One, I can't, which I did today

1472
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
So you could watch a little bit, and see the game

1473
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
You know, because my office is a little cramped

1474
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
It's harder to watch me play on PC, so we

1475
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
You know, did that a little bit, so

1476
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
It's nice to- And your TV's bigger

1477
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Yeah, TV is a lot bigger, yeah, it's nicer, so

1478
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Anyway, um

1479
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Bonds006 says I want all Forza games on PC

1480
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Well, they probably will be in the future

1481
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Forza Horizon 3 was on PC, too

1482
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I don't know about Motorsport, because I don't follow

1483
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
That series as closely, because I-

1484
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Seven is, I think

1485
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I prefer the arcade racers to the

1486
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Simulation racers, that's why you don't hear me talk

1487
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Like this about Gran Turismo

1488
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
But I fucking love Mario Kart

1489
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
And F-Zero, because those are arcade racers

1490
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
There's a big difference

1491
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Burnout, I love that game, that's an arcade racer

1492
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I stand blur

1493
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Really hard, and I'm really sad that that franchise

1494
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Is gone, because that was more of an arcade racer, too

1495
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Um, so, that's

1496
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
That's my thought

1497
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Let's see, what else, so we went to round one

1498
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I should quickly say, you got to have

1499
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Your first experience at round one

1500
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Yeah, I forgot to mention that in my, I guess as part

1501
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Of my gaming week

1502
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Oh, real quick, I just want to go back to Pokemon Go

1503
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Now, did you make sure to get one

1504
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Of those Pikachus with a hat, because they're

1505
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Very hard to find

1506
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
No, they went away today

1507
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I'm glad you asked, Loki

1508
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I lucked out, I tapped the one on my house

1509
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Yesterday morning, not only was it a Pikachu

1510
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
And a hat, it was a shiny Pikachu and a hat

1511
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
So knowing that those, I mean, as annoying

1512
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Those little guys were, because they were everywhere

1513
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
For like two days

1514
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Like, that makes that shiny

1515
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Really rare

1516
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
So like, my Pokemon E-peen

1517
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Is really big right now, because not only

1518
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Did I get the shiny hat Pikachu, but I got

1519
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
A shiny Drowzee today

1520
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
My shiny E-peen is like

1521
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Real shiny right now

1522
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Real shiny

1523
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I bathed for you, anyway

1524
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Where were we? Oh yes, round one

1525
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Round one, speaking of shiny

1526
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
In new places

1527
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
So yeah, round one was amazing

1528
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
It's huge, there's tons

1529
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Of arcade games in there

1530
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
We don't really have

1531
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Very many arcades anymore

1532
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
In the Toronto area

1533
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
There was a place that opened up recently

1534
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Right near the CN Tower

1535
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
And Skydome area

1536
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
That has arcade in it

1537
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
But it is a fraction

1538
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Of what is in round one

1539
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
In terms of both ticket spinners

1540
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
And arcade games

1541
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Like, round one

1542
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Just had a huge, a mass amount

1543
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Of games, so I was there

1544
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
With you playing

1545
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
I got to play some old fighting games

1546
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
That I really enjoyed, they had Tatsunoko

1547
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Versus Capcom

1548
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Which I had never played, I had only played it on Wii

1549
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
So it was fun to play that

1550
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I was playing some King of Fighters, I was playing some Street Fighter

1551
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
And they had

1552
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Mario and Sonic

1553
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
At the Rio Olympics

1554
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Which I didn't even know was an arcade game

1555
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
And also Luigi's Mansion

1556
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I had no idea that

1557
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Yeah, they had one of those at Dave and Buster's

1558
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
That was broken, aww

1559
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Yeah, I had no idea that these things

1560
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Were ever made as arcade games

1561
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
And I'm kind of wondering why they're not more

1562
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Available

1563
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
And rampant, but I guess it's just

1564
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Arcades probably aren't

1565
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
As big money makers, why they have those

1566
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Stupid ticket spinners

1567
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Yeah, I got to play

1568
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
The new BB&E 2DX

1569
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
The Cannonball Rush, I think it's called

1570
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Which is a racing theme, I didn't realize that

1571
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
But that's what they call it

1572
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And I actually played some of the new songs

1573
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Like, usually I'm really bad

1574
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Just ask JD, who goes to round one with me a lot

1575
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Like, when I go play 2DX, I'm really bad about

1576
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
What's in 4 style that I can go back and play

1577
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
So I, like, never play the new songs

1578
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
But this time I really did play some of the new songs

1579
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
There was some good stuff in there, it's just hard to hear in there

1580
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Yes, I was just gonna say

1581
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I was trying to do a rhythm game

1582
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I can't remember which one I was playing

1583
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
To be honest

1584
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
But it was very hard to play because I

1585
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Couldn't keep, I did not

1586
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Hear the music at all, period

1587
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I should have thought to tell you to bring headphones

1588
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
And I didn't remember this myself, because a lot of people

1589
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
You can put headphones in a lot of these jeans

1590
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Which is a great idea, because

1591
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Without it, you can't fucking hear shit in there

1592
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
So, um, yeah

1593
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
And I got to see Dance Rush, I didn't play it

1594
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Because the dance area was a little crowded

1595
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
And I was, like, I'm gonna just keep it real

1596
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
We had just had Lucille's BBQ

1597
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And so I was feeling very puffy

1598
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
And I was not

1599
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I was not gonna get on

1600
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
That was not the moment

1601
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
And JD's like, come on, play, dance, dance

1602
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I'm like, you don't understand

1603
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
If I get on that machine, it's gonna turn into

1604
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Dance, dance, fart

1605
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And none of y'all want that right now

1606
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Nobody deserves that kind of treatment

1607
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
You don't deserve that type of treatment

1608
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
The strangers don't deserve that type of treatment

1609
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
It's not gonna happen

1610
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I am perfectly fine just watching

1611
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Although, there were people there who were doing

1612
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Their gym workouts there

1613
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Right?

1614
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
There was a little bit of funk going on

1615
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
They had their shorts and their little gym towels

1616
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Bottled water, like, they were full on

1617
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
But then I think back

1618
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
That's just how I played DDR though

1619
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
I need those things in order to

1620
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Not be in your garage

1621
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I totally get it

1622
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Because if I don't have the towel

1623
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
It's gonna be dripping all over the place

1624
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
And then no one wants to slip in that

1625
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
So, anyway

1626
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
So I watched, and JD played

1627
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
DDR, and he did go into

1628
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
The retro mode, and he played

1629
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
D2R, so I could see

1630
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
The full background and how it emulates

1631
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
DDR Extreme and all that, and it was silly

1632
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
But in a good way

1633
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I appreciated the throwback

1634
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
That was pretty cool that I got to see that

1635
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Anyway, very long

1636
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Winded answer to gaming week, but it was pretty busy

1637
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Because when you're here, I'm gonna take you to all the

1638
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Fun spots to play games. We never did make it

1639
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
To coin-op, I was gonna take you there, but then I read

1640
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
They didn't have a Killer Instinct machine

1641
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Which I wanted

1642
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Delvin needs to play Killer Instinct in the arcade

1643
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
And I can't remember where around here has one

1644
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Maybe at that

1645
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Old arcade that's in Sutter

1646
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Street might have one

1647
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Oh, I always forget that place is there

1648
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Dang

1649
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Well, you know we might luck out

1650
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Because we're gonna go to Reno tomorrow

1651
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Which, that's a whole other story about why we're gonna go to Reno

1652
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
But we are

1653
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
And they have arcades there that time forgot

1654
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
You might luck out and find it

1655
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Yeah, we'll go check them out

1656
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Oh, Pepper Mill

1657
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Has like that retro arcade

1658
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
So, remind me

1659
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Go to Pepper Mill

1660
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Sounds like a plan

1661
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Alright, let's move on to some actual gaming news

1662
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
And not casino talk

1663
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
So, let's get into some gaming news with Loki

1664
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Starting us off tonight

1665
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
So, since we're not gonna be talking about movies anymore

1666
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Yes, I know that you guys are disappointed

1667
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Let's talk about something else

1668
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
That's coming soon

1669
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Rumored to be coming soon

1670
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
A new model of the Nintendo Switch

1671
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
According to the Wall Street Journal

1672
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Nintendo is gonna be introducing

1673
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
A new version of the Switch

1674
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Next year

1675
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
No word on what it is

1676
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Other than it will probably share some features

1677
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
With the current version

1678
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And be compatible with existing Switch software

1679
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Well, you don't say

1680
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
That's just a safe guess

1681
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Wall Street Journal

1682
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Nintendo is apparently

1683
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
They're debating on what new hardware

1684
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
And software features

1685
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
To include in the upgrade

1686
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Here's an idea

1687
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
If you don't know what to put in the upgrade

1688
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Don't fucking upgrade your system

1689
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Unless you have a plan

1690
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
You don't need to upgrade it

1691
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
If you have nothing to upgrade it with

1692
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And what do we really need to upgrade it with

1693
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I mean, the only thing I could see

1694
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
That they could do

1695
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
To add to the system

1696
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Really, is more storage

1697
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Cause 32GB onboard storage

1698
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Is fucking stupid nowadays

1699
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I'm imagining

1700
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
This is gonna sound ridiculous Loki

1701
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
But I think if they do

1702
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Like a 2019

1703
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
My hope is that they would not segregate

1704
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Like they did with new 3DS and 3DS

1705
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Where you're gonna have shit like Xenoblade Chronicles

1706
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
That only plays on new Switch

1707
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I would really hate to see that happen

1708
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
This early in the game

1709
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Not that it's an impossibility

1710
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Because there is a potential that Nintendo might just go in there

1711
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
And zhuzh it up a little bit

1712
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Zhuzh it up, meaning

1713
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Just a little more memory

1714
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
A fancier screen

1715
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
We're just gonna come in here and do a little makeover

1716
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Get the guys from Queer Eye to come

1717
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Get a little makeover

1718
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Just make sure Jonathan Van Ness

1719
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
We're gonna patch out that taker chip

1720
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
So you can't run that homebrew

1721
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Cause that's really what's got our knickers in a bunch

1722
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Make sure Jonathan Van Ness comes out and says gorgeous

1723
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
This is a gorgeous screen, it's very gorgeous

1724
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
We're gonna have a very gorgeous looking system here

1725
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
So one of my theories

1726
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
That we've talked about before

1727
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Is that

1728
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Pokemon is the big game that's obviously coming next year

1729
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Yes

1730
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
And that still is a game that is geared towards kids

1731
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
So

1732
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
My theory

1733
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
And thoughts is that

1734
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Whatever remake or redesign

1735
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Or upgrade that they're coming out with

1736
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Could potentially be

1737
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
A portable only version

1738
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Of the Switch

1739
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
That'll be a bit smaller for kids to use

1740
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
And it'll be a bit cheaper

1741
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
So that you're not giving your kid a

1742
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
$300 handheld system that they'll

1743
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Throw around inevitably and throw on the ground

1744
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
And whatever

1745
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
So that might be the angle they're going

1746
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
And then that will just be for people who only

1747
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Want to play the Switch on the go

1748
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
They'll have like a better screen

1749
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Like a smartphone type screen

1750
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
So for better battery life

1751
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Because we know that the Switch as it is now

1752
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Has poor battery life on the go

1753
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
So I think that might

1754
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
And it won't segregate the market that way

1755
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
That's

1756
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
An answer I'm comfortable with

1757
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
That's a good answer

1758
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
The Neon Family Feud, good answer

1759
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Here comes Loki

1760
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Here's why it's not gonna happen

1761
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
The reason why it's only a 720p

1762
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Screen in the first place

1763
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Is because it can't run anything

1764
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Higher than that in portable mode

1765
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
That's why it has to be plugged in because they're

1766
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Underclocking the CPU in that

1767
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
GPU to be able to run what's on there

1768
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
So

1769
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
For them to put like a 1080p

1770
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Screen in there, it's just not gonna happen

1771
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Because they can't

1772
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Do it, so if anything

1773
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I don't

1774
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Really know, it's just an excuse

1775
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Really just to upgrade that chip so that

1776
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
They can't have homebrew in there is really all

1777
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
It is. I just hope if they do this

1778
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
They take the 3DS out back

1779
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And shoot it

1780
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
That also is kind of

1781
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
My opinion segregating the portable market

1782
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Is that they still have these games like WarioWare

1783
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
That are coming out on the 3DS

1784
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
That we're not getting on the Switch now

1785
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Yes, I understand the WarioWare has like the

1786
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Blowing mechanics and some things that don't really

1787
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
That don't really exist on the Switch

1788
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Right, like the microphone and everything

1789
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
So I get it. There's a microphone on the Switch

1790
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Is there?

1791
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I think so. I don't think so

1792
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I think that's why everything had to go through a smartphone

1793
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Or you plug in a headphone or that whole thing

1794
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Because I don't think there's one built into it

1795
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
There's no camera either like there is on the 3DS

1796
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
So there's some things

1797
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
So I understand why it can't be one for one

1798
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
But like that Luigi's Mansion remake

1799
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
That should be on the Switch

1800
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
That should have been a Switch game

1801
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
So I do hope if they're going to

1802
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Ask us to get this newer Switch

1803
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
They really need to take the 3DS out back

1804
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
And shoot it

1805
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
They really need to have some pretty

1806
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Kick ass features that they're adding

1807
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
To it to get people to want it

1808
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Because just look at all the

1809
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Refreshes that they've done with the 3DS

1810
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
You know

1811
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Made it bigger

1812
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Added a little nub that no one wanted

1813
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says

1814
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I see where Delvin's going

1815
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Make a newer Switch that doesn't have

1816
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Detachable controllers

1817
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Doesn't have HDMI out or any of that type of stuff

1818
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
They can remove components which will make the system

1819
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Overall cheaper

1820
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Not having detachable controllers is going to be a big mistake

1821
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Because here's one problem

1822
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
First off you got games like Super Mario Party

1823
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Oh hey you want to play that game?

1824
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Well you got to detach the fucking controllers to play that game

1825
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Because we don't work in handheld mode

1826
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Well but that's because of the whole laying the screens next to each other

1827
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Thing which is kind of magic

1828
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I will say yeah

1829
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
It's stupid

1830
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
It's dumb though that you need to have it just to do the motion controls and stuff

1831
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
But I feel like that whole laying the screens

1832
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Next to each other sort of thing

1833
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
There's more to that

1834
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
We're going to see in a later game

1835
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I think that might just be one mode of the game

1836
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
No no but I mean that

1837
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Technology, that concept

1838
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
We're going to see it again

1839
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
And what better way to perhaps do that

1840
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
If more people have more of the portable

1841
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
To go version of Switch

1842
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Potentially

1843
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Alright well I mean we'll see where we go with it

1844
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I mean technically it is a rumor

1845
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
They may not do anything but

1846
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I wouldn't

1847
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I wouldn't put it past Nintendo to do it

1848
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Because honestly

1849
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I don't know

1850
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Why redesign it now?

1851
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Unless you fix your stupid

1852
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Online support

1853
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
With the whole app

1854
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Why do a PS4 mini

1855
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Two years after PS4 launches

1856
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I don't get that either

1857
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Or PS4 Pro

1858
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
It makes sense because it has

1859
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
You can push better graphics with it

1860
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
It has stronger processing power

1861
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
But it's

1862
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Not segregating the marketplace

1863
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Because it still runs

1864
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
All the same games and everything

1865
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I don't see what

1866
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
We may also be overthinking it to be fair

1867
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Because then my mind also goes

1868
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
They did do a new Xbox One

1869
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Like just a year and it was a gig

1870
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Instead of

1871
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
They did a different color or something too

1872
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
It's not that big a deal

1873
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
So maybe this whole thing

1874
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Is not going to be that big a deal

1875
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Like you said in the very beginning

1876
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
More on board storage memory to start

1877
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
And then maybe some different colors

1878
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I think it makes sense because

1879
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Having these installs with different games

1880
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
People are buying stuff

1881
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
More digitally

1882
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
The indie game marketplace is seriously driving

1883
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I think a lot of sales for the system

1884
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Because there's not a ton of games coming out

1885
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Especially mainline

1886
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Switch games

1887
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Yes and no

1888
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Because I think at this point the Switch has the backlog

1889
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Where when somebody comes to me and says

1890
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
If I buy a Switch what game should I buy

1891
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I'm sitting there going

1892
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Did you have a Wii U

1893
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
And at the end of the time the answer is no

1894
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
So I'm like alright

1895
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
You need to get Breath of the Wild

1896
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
You need to get Mario Odyssey

1897
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
You need to get Mario Party 8

1898
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Do you like Skyrim?

1899
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
You might need to get Skyrim

1900
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
There's a growing library of Switch games

1901
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Bayonetta

1902
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I always recommend Bayonetta 1 and 2

1903
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
There's a growing library of games now

1904
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I feel like the Switch doesn't need to justify

1905
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
We don't have enough games to play on the Switch

1906
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
You're thinking

1907
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
TL Shade

1908
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
That was Microsoft's problem

1909
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
They didn't have enough exclusives

1910
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
You can play Rise Son of Rome

1911
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
But everything else

1912
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Microsoft was offering

1913
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
At that time was on

1914
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
PlayStation 4

1915
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Which is why

1916
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I'm bringing this up again because you and I were just talking about this last night

1917
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
We were having a little nerd out

1918
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Nervous Lumber Party

1919
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I said how quickly we forget

1920
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Never forget

1921
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
The biggest news

1922
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Out of E3 2018

1923
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Is that Microsoft acquired

1924
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
A bunch of fucking studios

1925
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
They are laying this

1926
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
They are laying out this path

1927
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
To get them back

1928
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
In the front of the pack

1929
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
And that is going to be

1930
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
When they unleash whatever their next system is

1931
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
They're going to have all these games

1932
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Only playable on Xbox

1933
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
It's just the question is going to be

1934
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Are you going to put out Forza Horizon

1935
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Crackdown type games

1936
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
As exclusives

1937
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Or are you going to put out Rise Son of Rome

1938
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Because one of them

1939
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Will make Microsoft in the lead

1940
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
At least in the US

1941
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
One of them? Pack it up

1942
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
You all know what I mean

1943
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Alright

1944
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
But anyway

1945
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
In Nintendo's case

1946
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
We've always known this is Nintendo's

1947
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Thing that is going to always put them

1948
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
In a league of their own

1949
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Nintendo is the

1950
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
The underscore bolded

1951
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
The best

1952
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Game maker

1953
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Making video games

1954
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
True story

1955
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I don't know if that's the case anymore

1956
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Honestly

1957
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I don't

1958
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
There's a long pause because I'm looking

1959
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I gave him that look

1960
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I get it

1961
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Super Mario Odyssey was a great game

1962
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
But I mean

1963
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Other companies make great games too

1964
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Sure

1965
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I'm just saying Nintendo's the best

1966
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I think we're giving them too much

1967
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
We're giving them too much

1968
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Well it's fine that you're doing this bullshit

1969
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Because you made Super Mario Odyssey

1970
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
It's fine that you're doing this bullshit

1971
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Because you made Breath of the Wild

1972
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I don't know

1973
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Bobby Blackwolf is trying to summarize

1974
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
What you're saying

1975
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
In quotes here

1976
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I get it Nintendo makes great games

1977
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
It sucks

1978
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Yeah they suck at everything else

1979
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
And you know what

1980
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I understand that you think it doesn't matter

1981
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
They make great games

1982
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
But if you're running it on hardware that doesn't make any fucking sense

1983
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Or they have shit that gets in the way

1984
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Then that's going to be the problem

1985
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I get it when people are like

1986
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Why won't Nintendo just put their games out on the

1987
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
PlayStation 4 that would fix everything

1988
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I get it

1989
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Exactly

1990
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Wow that would be fucking awesome

1991
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
That would be like gaming would never be better

1992
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Than if like

1993
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
If Nintendo made games

1994
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
For the Sony PlayStation 4

1995
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
And Microsoft did all of the online component

1996
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Like that would be the perfect thing

1997
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Oh that would be perfect

1998
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Not going to ever fucking happen

1999
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
But I might masturbate to that later

2000
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Great theory

2001
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Great idea

2002
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Never going to happen

2003
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Well let's see

2004
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
I have to wait and see what the system is going to be

2005
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I might like

2006
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
With everything with Nintendo my expectations are low

2007
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Alright let's move on

2008
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Let's talk about Fortnite

2009
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
You want to talk about what's fucking huge in gaming right now

2010
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
It doesn't matter what system you own

2011
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Because now we got the cross play problem solved

2012
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
So this game is literally

2013
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Everywhere

2014
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Fortnite

2015
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
It's on the phones, it's on the Switch, on the PS4

2016
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
It's on the PC, it's on Macs

2017
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
It's everywhere

2018
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Everybody's playing it during the Emmys

2019
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Yes as we learned on RuPaul's podcast

2020
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
This last week

2021
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Carson Daly was playing Fortnite during the Emmys

2022
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Apparently

2023
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
So anyway, Fortnite is still going

2024
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
And now there's going to be more encouragement

2025
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
To try to kind of keep that Fortnite

2026
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Train going

2027
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Because you know one place where

2028
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
PUBG is probably

2029
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
PUBG lost a lot of steam

2030
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
They were the number one, number two game on Twitch

2031
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
For a long time

2032
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
And it seemed like PUBG news

2033
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Was getting really light

2034
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
And they started to kind of fall behind a little bit

2035
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
And I'm not totally shading PUBG

2036
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
But that's just

2037
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Facts are facts

2038
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Go look at the Twitch standings

2039
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
PUBG is not number one anymore

2040
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Facts are facts America

2041
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Epic wants to keep Fortnite out in the lead

2042
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
So here's an idea

2043
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Why not pay content creators

2044
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
And this is

2045
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
This is like

2046
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Interesting because I can't think of a lot of

2047
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Game makers

2048
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Because you know some game makers

2049
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Want to stop content creators

2050
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Maybe that's not

2051
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Completely fair but you know what I mean

2052
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Sometimes they hold them back a little bit

2053
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
But Epic is launching a

2054
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Support a creator event

2055
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
That will send real money

2056
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
To folks on Twitch and YouTube

2057
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
When gamers make purchases with

2058
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
V-Bucks

2059
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
So starting October 8th until the end of

2060
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
18 if you put in the name

2061
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Of a creator in Fortnite's

2062
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Shop to reward them

2063
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
When you buy a costume or glider

2064
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
So you know

2065
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Guess what you're gonna start hearing on every

2066
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Podcast who knows maybe this one I don't know

2067
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
It's gonna be use offer code

2068
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
O-L-R at checkout

2069
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
That's offer code O-L-R

2070
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Yeah that's right it's offer code

2071
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
O-L-R

2072
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
At checkout

2073
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Watch watch these content

2074
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Creators of Fortnite wait for it

2075
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
And let's find our best content creators

2076
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Plugging their offer codes

2077
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
That they're gonna put in at checkout

2078
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
This is standard business nowadays because you know

2079
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
You're not getting paid by YouTube

2080
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Or Twitch that much

2081
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I mean so you gotta make your money

2082
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Somewhere but this is interesting because

2083
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
The only like

2084
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Qualifications for this you have to

2085
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Produce Fortnite related material in the

2086
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Past 30 days have at

2087
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Least 1,000 social

2088
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Media followers which sounds high

2089
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
But social media like I have

2090
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
That on Twitter like not to be that

2091
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Guy but like you know if you have

2092
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Been on social media and working

2093
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
All that long enough and frequent enough you're

2094
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Probably gaining a lot of followers

2095
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
So um and I

2096
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Didn't see if that is a thousand YouTube

2097
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
A thousand Twitch I don't know but you have to

2098
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Have a thousand followers and you have to

2099
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Avoid illegal or toxic

2100
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Behavior so you can't be a jerk

2101
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Fair enough

2102
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
It's not gonna be it's not gonna pay your mortgage

2103
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
50,000 V-Bucks

2104
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
That's about $500

2105
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
The creator will get $25

2106
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
So that's like 5%

2107
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Which I mean

2108
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
It's not a bad

2109
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
It's right it's better than nothing

2110
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Somebody like Ninja

2111
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Oh he's gonna be raking it in

2112
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Oh it is he's gonna be he's gonna fill a bathtub

2113
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Full of money it's gonna be like that scene with Demi

2114
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Morin in Decent Proposal where she's laughing on the

2115
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Bedroll that's gonna be Ninja

2116
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Okay it already is Ninja

2117
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Anyway

2118
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
So yeah it's gonna incentivize

2119
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Content creators to move

2120
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
And Loki yes in some ways

2121
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Like you know there's

2122
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Other ways that content creators can make money

2123
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Through like biddies on Twitch and subscriptions

2124
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
And all that but you know what

2125
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Knowing that wow if I keep playing

2126
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Fortnite I can make a little more

2127
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Money is gonna keep people

2128
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Playing Fortnite it's smart

2129
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
It even makes me wanna go

2130
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
I have a thousand social media followers

2131
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Maybe I need to play Fortnite some night

2132
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
I'm not gonna but I hope some other companies

2133
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
It would be pretty cool if they follow up on this

2134
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
It would be pretty rad

2135
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
And then it's kind of a

2136
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Another way to keep

2137
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Fortnite popular cause

2138
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
If Fortnite just stays on Twitch

2139
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Or YouTube as the number one most

2140
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Watched game

2141
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
It just keeps it in people's face

2142
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
It does it does

2143
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Here's the new mode here's the new stuff here's all the new

2144
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Crap you can buy on the online marketplace

2145
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
For sure for sure anyway well let's move

2146
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
On Loki

2147
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Alright

2148
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
So apparently

2149
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
For the longest time we've been asking

2150
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
For the ability to be able to change our

2151
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
PlayStation Network

2152
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
User names

2153
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
And Sony's always said

2154
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Oh yeah don't worry we'll have something worked out

2155
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Soon you know we're working on it we're looking into

2156
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
It blah blah blah

2157
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Well that might actually be getting closer because

2158
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Apparently

2159
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
There's been some game studios

2160
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
That have been speaking anonymously

2161
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
To different social

2162
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Media outlets and letting them

2163
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Know that hey

2164
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
That they've been

2165
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Participating in bug fixing

2166
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
And tweaking settings and stuff like that

2167
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
To make sure that it's gonna be compatible

2168
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Their games are compatible with these

2169
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
PlayStation Network name profile

2170
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Changes or user names

2171
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
So they have like the option

2172
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
To edit user name

2173
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
They have like a guide

2174
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
That they've been going off of to kind of

2175
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Work on it so it is something that is coming up

2176
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Um

2177
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
We don't know when yet

2178
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I remember that they were originally talking that

2179
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
They're gonna make the announcement at PSX

2180
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
But that's not gonna happen this year so maybe

2181
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Around that time maybe the end

2182
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Of this year I don't know there's nothing to stop them

2183
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
From just doing an internet press release I mean

2184
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
That's the way you can do things now

2185
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
So they've got that PlayStation blog

2186
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
They've got a Twitter account

2187
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
They dump a bombshell like that

2188
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
And it's gonna run around the internet real quick

2189
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
So that's something people have been asking

2190
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
For it does seem ridiculous

2191
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
That now it's like 2018 and we're still

2192
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Oh my god Sony might allow you the

2193
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Ability to change your name real soon y'all

2194
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
I wonder what the reason behind that is

2195
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
It's gotta do something with the infrastructure

2196
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
There's gotta be something rooted in

2197
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Yeah I think it was their infrastructure where they had the

2198
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
User names like the accounts were tied

2199
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
To the user name it wasn't tied to like some

2200
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Number that the user name was like

2201
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
You know tied to the account

2202
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Yeah so now they have to

2203
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Go back and rework all that shit so that

2204
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
It's now tied to this universal number

2205
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
That your user name is then tied to that

2206
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Account so you can change it

2207
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Or whatever it just it just seems weird

2208
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
That it would have taken this long to get here

2209
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Because I mean and then again

2210
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
I don't know as much about networking

2211
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
And infrastructure so I will be the first to admit

2212
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Maybe I'm just ignorant to how

2213
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Hard this really is

2214
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
But why wouldn't they have just

2215
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
At some point

2216
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Taken Playstation Network down for a day

2217
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
To say we're gonna run this thing

2218
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
That's gonna change all your

2219
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
User names behind the scenes into a number

2220
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
And then that number is now you

2221
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
But you won't see it because now you have your name

2222
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
And then now if you wanna change your name it's fine

2223
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Cause we put in those numbers behind the scene

2224
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
That's why we took Playstation Network down for a day

2225
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Like

2226
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Am I crazy?

2227
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Whenever there's a database

2228
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
And someone's

2229
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Information is in there

2230
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
That information is tied to an

2231
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
ID and that could be a number

2232
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
It could be a name it's just something that's

2233
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
A unique identifier and they probably

2234
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Chose the user name to be that unique identifier

2235
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Which was a poor choice

2236
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Now that I know in Microsoft Access you always

2237
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Have your key field

2238
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
So they

2239
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Basically chose the user name to be the unique

2240
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Identifier instead of it being

2241
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Some other number behind the

2242
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Scene usually a key that's like numbers

2243
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
And letters and now

2244
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
So if you change it it almost

2245
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Fucks up the account and then maybe

2246
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
This would've prevented the hack because we would've

2247
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Never well no because I was like maybe

2248
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
They would've only seen that random numbers of letters

2249
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
And numbers and not you know the user names but

2250
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Actually no they would've still pulled

2251
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
The other yeah yeah anyway

2252
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Alright anyway let's move on I wanna talk about

2253
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
This because I think I don't know if this is gonna be

2254
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
So much a game but it's like VR

2255
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
It's gonna be Oculus

2256
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
And HTC Vive

2257
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
And I don't know about you guys but I'm

2258
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Super into it and this is

2259
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
A new VR experience

2260
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
I don't know if it's like a game

2261
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
But knowing what it is

2262
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
It's probably gonna be like

2263
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Like what is it anyway

2264
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
It's Twin Peaks is what it is so Twin Peaks

2265
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Y'all know it was a show

2266
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Back in the 90's on ABC but then they

2267
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Brought it back recently on Showtime

2268
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
And I was a fan of the old

2269
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Series and I loved the new one too

2270
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Even though there was a lot of like

2271
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Especially like

2272
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Here's the thing with Twin Peaks

2273
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
The next to last episode like if they had

2274
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Ended it with that it would've been like

2275
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
They kinda answered a lot of the questions

2276
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
They kept some things open I love the way that

2277
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Next to last episode ended but then

2278
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
In true David Lynch form there's a

2279
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Full another episode after that that keeps

2280
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Going that the entire thing

2281
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Is just what the

2282
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Fuck and that's

2283
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
How it ends but that's

2284
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
But you go to see a David

2285
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Lynch anything you need to be prepared

2286
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
To be walking out of that theater going

2287
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
What the actual

2288
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Fuck was that

2289
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
And that was what happened when I saw Lost Highway

2290
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Years ago in the theater as I left out

2291
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
What the fuck

2292
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Keske fuck

2293
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Anyway

2294
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
So maybe that's gonna be the same thing

2295
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
When you do Twin Peaks VR is that you're gonna be

2296
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Putting that going into that and then like what the fuck

2297
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
I have never watched Twin Peaks ever

2298
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Really you should

2299
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Here's the thing in my

2300
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Personal opinion the first

2301
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Season that was on ABC that's

2302
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Only like 7 episodes or something like that

2303
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Is like a must watch

2304
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
It is really fucking good and like

2305
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
You see things

2306
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
There that they weren't doing in TV

2307
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
In the 90's that people are doing

2308
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Now the second

2309
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Season of the show like

2310
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
If you like the first season and you

2311
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Want to get more of the story you should watch the

2312
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Second season only because it

2313
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Kind of continues it but it does get

2314
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Weaker throughout the second season

2315
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Because David Lynch didn't do all of it

2316
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
The network put a lot

2317
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Of pressure to reveal Laura Palmer's

2318
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Killer before they really wanted to do it

2319
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
And it kind of went downhill after they revealed a killer

2320
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
But there are elements

2321
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
In that that then come back

2322
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
In Twin Peaks

2323
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
The Return so if you're not gonna

2324
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Watch the second season at least read

2325
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
The cliff notes read the spoilers read through it

2326
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
And then watch The Return because

2327
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
In my opinion The Return like

2328
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Is like there

2329
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
It's crazy because like I said the 90's

2330
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Version of Twin Peaks there was nothing like it

2331
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
On TV then The Return

2332
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
There's nothing like it on TV

2333
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Now like there was a

2334
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Particular episode of that show

2335
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
And any of you that watch it will know that I was talking

2336
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
About that was like

2337
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
40 minutes of just

2338
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Pure

2339
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
What the

2340
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Fuck am I watching

2341
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
But like you sit there at the end of it

2342
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
And going I think

2343
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
I understood a third

2344
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Of that

2345
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
But it was really fucking brilliant

2346
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
That that was art

2347
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I don't know what it was

2348
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
But it was art

2349
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
And any of you that have watched the revival series

2350
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Know exactly which episode I'm talking about

2351
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Anyway

2352
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I'm sorry I'm finally looking at chat over

2353
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
At live.vognetwork.com

2354
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
As Joe and Hunter Matt said I stopped trying to make sense

2355
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Of David Lynch after the 90's if you try to

2356
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
You're just gonna hurt your brain yep pretty much

2357
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Anyway

2358
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
So Twin Peaks VR

2359
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Where this whole thing was supposed to be started

2360
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
So Twin Peaks VR is gonna put you in the Red

2361
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Room which is a very important place

2362
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
In Twin Peaks mythology

2363
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
This could be considered a minor

2364
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Spoiler but the Red Room

2365
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Is basically like you could think of it as like

2366
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
A gateway to hell that's kind of like what I

2367
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Sort of look at it as is that the Red Room is like

2368
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
A gateway to hell

2369
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
So anyway

2370
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Twin Peaks also gets into this whole mythology

2371
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
About that there could be doppelgangers

2372
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
In the world that you may have

2373
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Somebody that looks exactly like you but they are

2374
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
From this bad place type of thing

2375
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Do they have a goatee?

2376
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Um

2377
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Not necessarily

2378
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
But I'll leave it at that

2379
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Anyway so

2380
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Twin Peaks VR is gonna take you in this Red Room

2381
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
And you'll be in there

2382
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
And you're gonna they say in the game

2383
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
You wind up in the Red Room and

2384
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Fans of the series will follow in the footsteps of

2385
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Dale Cooper to try to make their way back

2386
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Into the life that they left behind

2387
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
So there will be places and dialogues

2388
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
From the original series and the sequel

2389
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
It's gonna be made for the HTC Vive

2390
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
And the Rift it's only gonna be available

2391
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
On Steam we don't know when it's gonna come

2392
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Out but they are showing it next

2393
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Weekend at the Festival of

2394
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Disruption in Los Angeles

2395
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Which I believe is a David Lynch or at least

2396
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
David Lynch has a large part of this

2397
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Festival thing going on cause you know

2398
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Katya is actually gonna be performing at it too

2399
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Random?

2400
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Well because no Katya fucking loves Twin Peaks

2401
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Like her thing

2402
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
At DragCon New York City where you took a

2403
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Picture of her she fucking her set

2404
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Was the Red Room from Twin Peaks

2405
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
And she's actually made outfits

2406
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Inspired by Twin Peaks like she's

2407
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
She's a stan She's very into it

2408
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
And that's why I love her cause she loves

2409
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
That weird shit so anyway

2410
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Sadly

2411
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
No word if it's gonna be on PlayStation

2412
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
VR

2413
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Cause you know that would be a nice thing

2414
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
So anyway

2415
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Do you get pie though?

2416
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
No word if there will be a damn fine cup of coffee

2417
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Involved no word on that yet

2418
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Or if there will be random dancing to songs

2419
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Playing on the jukebox who knows

2420
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Anyway I think we should move on to other

2421
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Other weird television shows

2422
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
And things that have spawned from them right Loki?

2423
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Yes like The Walking Dead

2424
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Unfortunately like The Walking Dead

2425
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
We might also kind of compare The Walking Dead

2426
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
To Telltale

2427
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Which is kind of Walking Dead

2428
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Of it's own

2429
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Being that they've laid off 90%

2430
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Of their staff

2431
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
But that's not all because they're continuing

2432
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
To lay off people as well

2433
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
So

2434
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
They had a skeleton crew

2435
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
That was you know left behind to kind of

2436
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Finish up some of the stuff on The Walking Dead

2437
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
And also

2438
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
The interactive Minecraft

2439
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Series that's supposed to be on

2440
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Netflix well

2441
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Now of course with that

2442
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
They're going to be letting

2443
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Some of those people go as well

2444
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Because now they have another

2445
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Team that's gonna be working on

2446
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
The

2447
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Walking Dead series

2448
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
So they said everyone involved is trying to make sure

2449
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Clementines story is told

2450
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I'm not concerned at the moment with

2451
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Telling that story

2452
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
In the comics

2453
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
They said that

2454
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
As odd as it may sound 25 of us will continue

2455
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Foreseeable

2456
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
I'll make further comment

2457
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
In the coming weeks after today's events

2458
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
It's not clear of

2459
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
How many of those 25 will

2460
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Remain because they're not trying

2461
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
To necessarily

2462
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Keep them around I guess since they have

2463
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Another studio going to be working on it

2464
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
And so yeah with that there is gonna be

2465
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
The series will be finished by

2466
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Another company so they've got

2467
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Skybound Games is gonna be

2468
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Completing season 4

2469
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Of The Walking Dead

2470
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
And of course they made an announcement on

2471
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Twitter saying we're so happy to

2472
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Announce that we've reached a deal with Telltale Games

2473
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
That will allow Skybound

2474
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
To continue The Walking Dead final

2475
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Season more details

2476
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
To come I want to say that they were

2477
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Trying to

2478
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
They're working with the original Telltale team

2479
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
To finish the story

2480
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
The way that the fans deserve

2481
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Um

2482
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Still disappointing to see that they're

2483
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
You know letting go all those people

2484
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Without severance and now they have another team

2485
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Working on the game that doesn't make any sense but

2486
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
That's what they're doing

2487
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
I don't know

2488
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I don't really

2489
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Follow the walking dead

2490
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Games I know that they're pretty good but

2491
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
It kinda sucks cause you know

2492
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
The quality is gonna be quite

2493
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
I don't know if it's gonna be up there with the other

2494
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Games

2495
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Yeah this is really unexplored territory too

2496
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
With the studio closing and a lot of people

2497
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Have very strong feelings about how Telltale

2498
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Has treated those employees

2499
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
But yet at the same time

2500
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Telltale has created these obligations

2501
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
To customers out there that they are

2502
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Also not gonna be able to follow up on

2503
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
You know now they've got this whole exchange

2504
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
But there's this whole like

2505
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Duality now where it's like okay

2506
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Well who is more important in this scenario

2507
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
The obligation to the customer

2508
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Or the obligation to the employees

2509
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Because this is gonna be

2510
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Great in I guess fulfilling

2511
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
That obligation to the customer even though

2512
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
The quality may be who knows what

2513
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
I suppose it depends on how many of those Telltale

2514
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Employees they get but it's not

2515
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Gonna really address the concern of how

2516
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
To Telltale treat the employees

2517
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Sure some of them may be able to come

2518
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
On but we know it's not gonna be all of them

2519
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Some of those folks have probably already

2520
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Moved on to new jobs

2521
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I don't know if like honestly if it were

2522
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Me you know unless you're really really

2523
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Passionate about like your job and stuff

2524
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Like I can't imagine like oh I

2525
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Got fired without severance yeah

2526
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
And now you want me to work on that game again

2527
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
That's very true and those

2528
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Employees have every right like even if they extend

2529
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
This offer and say would you like to come finish the game

2530
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
These employees have every right to say go take a hike

2531
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Like just I'm not interested

2532
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Because I have bad memories

2533
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
With that are they being asked to come back

2534
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
With pay or like just make it

2535
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
The game well I would assume I would

2536
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Assume with pay if it's a new company that's

2537
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Taking on the obligation to finish it

2538
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
The company this new company would hire

2539
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Them and do what they need to do

2540
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
We'll give you some exposure yeah

2541
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Anyway

2542
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
D'artitsuya in chat says

2543
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
The Telltale news for sure sucks but at the very

2544
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Least the story gets to be completed

2545
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Not that I'm letting them off the hook and I guess

2546
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
That's where my mind is at

2547
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Is I'm like okay this

2548
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Is going to help with half the problem

2549
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
The obligation to the customers

2550
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Will get filled

2551
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Even though the quality is still

2552
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
TBD we'll give them the benefit

2553
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Of the doubt and hope it's going to be a great

2554
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Maybe is that going to give them more money to

2555
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Pay these severances or are they just

2556
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Pocketing that that would be fabulous

2557
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
And then maybe address some of the concern

2558
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
About what happened to the other half

2559
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
But unfortunately the realist

2560
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
In me is like this new

2561
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Company has

2562
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
No need

2563
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I mean has no obligation to pay

2564
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Another company's

2565
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Severance you know what I mean

2566
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
And please please do not misinterpret

2567
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
What I'm saying those people deserve to be treated

2568
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Better but that's not this

2569
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Company that's trying to come in and fix some of the

2570
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Problems it's not their problem

2571
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
They're selling the rights to this company

2572
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
To like make the game because

2573
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
It's their series but maybe they're

2574
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Getting like a portion of that

2575
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
You know those profits

2576
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Going back to their original telltale company

2577
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Because it's their game

2578
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Well and then I hope that money gets redistributed to the

2579
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Employees because the management

2580
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
And the board don't deserve a fucking dime

2581
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
But aren't they just finishing the

2582
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Stories for what people have

2583
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Already paid for yes so that

2584
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Means there's no new money coming in

2585
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
These people have already paid for this

2586
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Game and what money they

2587
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Made already wasn't enough to pay severance

2588
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
So there isn't any new money coming in

2589
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
To finish whatever chapters are left

2590
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Correct so

2591
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Yeah no it sucks so this new company that's

2592
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Doing it isn't gonna get a dime

2593
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Really because people have already paid for the

2594
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Content unless new people come on

2595
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Later and buy

2596
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
The whole thing but

2597
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
For the most part they're just fulfilling back orders

2598
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Right yeah and that's why I'm like

2599
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
The new company like even

2600
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Though I have a hard time saying yay

2601
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Everything is better okay I'm

2602
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Gonna get this new company is doing a good thing

2603
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
I think it's good intentioned and they're trying

2604
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
To fix some of the problem what

2605
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
They can do fixing

2606
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
This problem with the severance and everything I don't

2607
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Think this new company can do at least not

2608
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Now not unless a ton of people buy

2609
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
This game and they made buku bucks but

2610
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
At that point I mean how long

2611
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Before these games come out and turn a profit it's

2612
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Probably gonna take some time you know and

2613
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Even then these other folks hopefully will

2614
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Have moved on but likely add to new

2615
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Jobs it's just it's a shitty

2616
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Situation and it's telltale management's

2617
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Fault and it's unfortunate

2618
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
I hope the industry

2619
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
As a whole is kind of watching

2620
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
What's happening to this and

2621
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Especially how pissed off a lot of people

2622
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Are getting about it and especially how

2623
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
It's moving more and more game

2624
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Makers to kind of go you know

2625
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Maybe we do need to unionize

2626
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
And it could be very interesting if this

2627
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Is gonna be the the straw that

2628
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Start or the what was

2629
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
An analogy I can use here the rock that starts

2630
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
The avalanche so to speak with that whole thing

2631
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
So all right

2632
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Let's move on one more thing here before we get to the classic

2633
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Game of the week I want to talk about a beloved

2634
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Game from the past I don't know about you guys but I

2635
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Always love this game did you guys ever play a game called

2636
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Descent on PC?

2637
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Yeah it was pretty cool because it kind of came out

2638
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
In that first person era when

2639
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Doom and Wolfenstein really started

2640
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Taking off but Descent was really

2641
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
The first game that had the full

2642
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
360 degrees of movement

2643
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Cause like in Doom you move forward

2644
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Back side side but in Descent

2645
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
You were a ship and you flew

2646
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Around rooms and you really had

2647
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
360 degrees of movement so they

2648
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Made a few Descent games within the series

2649
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Kind of went kaput well

2650
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Apparently a new Descent

2651
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Game is coming out next year

2652
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
On PC and consoles

2653
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
So it was announced by

2654
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Little Orbit who is a independent

2655
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Video game publisher and Descendant

2656
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Studios they are making

2657
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
A reimagining of

2658
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Descent you will be going through

2659
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Twisting tunnels and caverns

2660
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Where again like the originals up and

2661
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Down is you know you're gonna

2662
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Move all over the place you have to be able to think

2663
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
In 360 degrees

2664
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
So anyway they say

2665
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
This is actually a Kickstarter project from a long

2666
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Time ago so it took about 3 years

2667
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
To get here but the retail and digital release

2668
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
For PC, Xbox One, and Playstation 4

2669
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Is early 2019 the

2670
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Switch is now included in this so you can

2671
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Play Descent if you wanna you know throw up on the

2672
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Go by spinning in all those different directions

2673
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
You can do that if you

2674
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Pre-order now you will get access

2675
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
To a PC beta starting later

2676
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
This year a custom version of the

2677
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Generation 3 Voila ship

2678
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
With a new paint job

2679
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
PC beta challenges

2680
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Multi-pass upgrade for multiplayer

2681
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Secret missions DLC

2682
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
You know all the extra crap they tack on to games

2683
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
These days so anyway kind of

2684
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Neat the Descent is coming back and

2685
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Always nice to see a Kickstarter come full

2686
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Circle and actually get its release

2687
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
And be fully realized which sadly

2688
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Doesn't happen 100% of the time

2689
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
But we're getting there

2690
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Would anyone want to check out the new Descent game

2691
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I'm curious about it

2692
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I love the old one

2693
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Sorry I was texting with my wife apparently they launched

2694
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
A Falcon 9 rocket near by

2695
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
You can actually see it outside

2696
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Really? Yeah

2697
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Yeah pretty close like

2698
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
She sent me pictures she's like what the hell is that

2699
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Why are they launching rockets

2700
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Fuck if I know

2701
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Random

2702
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Delvin I hope your trip

2703
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
To the US doesn't end in tragedy

2704
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Why are they launching no I'm

2705
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
I'm obviously kidding but

2706
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
It's neat that they bring back I remember we were talking about that

2707
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
When they first announced that they were doing that

2708
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I mean I

2709
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
I never really liked the original Descent

2710
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I had like the demo for it it came out like one of those PC gamer

2711
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Discs or something like that

2712
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Back when they used to do that I don't know if they still

2713
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Do those but

2714
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
I don't know I just never really got

2715
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
It was hard enough for me to control like

2716
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
First person shooters let alone a

2717
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
360 first person shooter

2718
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
But

2719
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
I never played the original

2720
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
I never heard of the game so

2721
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
I mean if there's a demo I'll

2722
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Check it out but other than that

2723
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Probably not cause is it kinda like a

2724
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Like a Star Fox type

2725
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
I wouldn't really call it Star Fox like imagine if

2726
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Star Fox was Doom

2727
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Kinda a little more like that it's a little more realistic

2728
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
I suppose than talking animals

2729
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Well no I'm not I just mean in terms of like

2730
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
It's a flying shooting game

2731
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Yeah but you move like you might wanna go to a room

2732
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
That's above you so you actually fly up

2733
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Where as like Star Fox was still kinda

2734
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Like on rails a bit

2735
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
You know what I mean like this gives you the full

2736
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
360 degrees of motion

2737
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
So I mean it'll probably be like a very kinda

2738
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Competent space shooter game

2739
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Multiplayer was a lot of fun though I will say that

2740
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Because that was also the day when you know

2741
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Modems and BBS's you'd hook up through that

2742
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
And you could play like 4 player Doom online

2743
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Or Duke Nukem

2744
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
And that was a lot of fun too because you could

2745
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Hide above somebody

2746
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
In a game like Descent so it might be neat

2747
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
We'll see anyway uh

2748
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Let's move on to the classic game of the week you know

2749
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
One of these weeks we'll have to do Descent

2750
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
As the classic game of the week but I don't think

2751
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
That is what Dark Soccer has in store

2752
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
For us this week let's go ask

2753
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Jamie Summers what the classic game of the week this week

2754
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Will be

2755
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
So we take a

2756
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Step back in time

2757
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Figuratively and literally

2758
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
In the classic game of the week

2759
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Where Dark Soccer is here

2760
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
It's magic you just appeared

2761
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Delvin disappeared and you appeared

2762
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Oh my god where did Delvin go

2763
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Well through the magic of space and time

2764
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
He's actually not here yet

2765
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Right he gets to see me

2766
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
As a nun but yet he's there I know

2767
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
It's going to be a very exciting weekend anyway

2768
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Let's continue this exciting weekend

2769
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
By talking about actually it's going to be way more exciting

2770
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
For us because we're going to Reno

2771
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
That's where the nuns go I saw that Whoopi

2772
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Goldberg movie Sister Act

2773
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Reno and Gamora

2774
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Nuns in Reno are nuns

2775
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Alright anyway

2776
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Girl

2777
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
It's the classic game of the week Dark Soccer

2778
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Is going to take a trip back and walk into the vault

2779
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
And find a game that she thinks hey

2780
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
You should get to church

2781
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Or play this game

2782
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Or cry like the poor Oppa Oppa

2783
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Or I will slap you with a ruler like nuns do

2784
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Alright it's the classic game of the week

2785
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Dark Soccer what did you pick for us

2786
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Actually did you know you want a fun fact

2787
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Before we get into tonight's classic game of the week

2788
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Fun fact for the listeners

2789
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
So we were having dinner earlier this evening

2790
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
As people do sometimes

2791
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Dark Soccer and I went on a date

2792
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
So Delvin was there too so it was a triad date

2793
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
But anyway we were eating and we were

2794
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Talking about this segment the classic game of the week

2795
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
And we were wondering how long is it

2796
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Until the classic game of the week

2797
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Can be the classic game of the week

2798
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Like is this segment so thanks to the

2799
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Wonderful people that maintain the wiki

2800
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
I went back to the wiki and found out

2801
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
This week October 7th

2802
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
2007

2803
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Was the first classic game of the week

2804
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
So it's actually 11 years old

2805
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
This week

2806
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
So I'm doing the classic game of the week as the classic game of the week

2807
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I'm kidding I'm not

2808
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Do you know what the very first classic game of the week ever was that we did

2809
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
I believe it was Fantasy Zone

2810
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
It was Fantasy Zone

2811
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
So tonight for our 11th anniversary spectacular

2812
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
We're doing a sequel

2813
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
That's Fantasy Zone 1-1

2814
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
We're doing Fantasy Zone 2

2815
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
The Tears of Oppa Oppa

2816
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Oh it's not Electric Boogaloo?

2817
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Or as it was called Oppa Oppa

2818
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Non Amida

2819
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Which basically means Oppa Oppa Tears

2820
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
And I'm actually kind of doing 2 and 1

2821
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Because I wanted to do the System 16 remake

2822
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
But to do that I have to talk

2823
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
About the Sega Master System

2824
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Which this is one of the few

2825
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Times where the game has come out at home

2826
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
And then years later they remade it

2827
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
For the arcade

2828
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
There's a lot of situations where that's happened

2829
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I mean maybe things like Street Fighter V

2830
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Question mark

2831
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Maybe

2832
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
In modern times that really doesn't happen

2833
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Well at any rate

2834
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
This was a Sega Master System game

2835
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
That came out in 1987

2836
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Of course it was a Sega game

2837
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
It was ported to the arcade

2838
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Ported to the arcade

2839
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Famicom and MSX

2840
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
And then there was a remake

2841
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
For System 16 hardware

2842
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
population in 2008

2843
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
It had virtual console releases

2844
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
But we're going to

2845
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Go a little bit more

2846
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Into what this game is like

2847
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
So Fantasy Zone 2 does play

2848
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Like the first Fantasy Zone

2849
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Where it's defender style

2850
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
You have a continuously scrolling screen

2851
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
You can go back and forth

2852
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
And shoot down little bases

2853
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
And it does qualify as a shooter

2854
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Not really fond of that term

2855
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
But anyway

2856
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Now this game has such a fucking

2857
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Convoluted storyline

2858
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Oh my god Rob it has like three endings

2859
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
People play this game for the story?

2860
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
One of the endings

2861
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Spoiler

2862
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
I play it because it's a cute shooter

2863
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Oh my god you're going to spoil a 30 year old game

2864
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Opa Opa turns evil

2865
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
And kills the space Harrier

2866
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Opa Opa loses to his evil self

2867
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Evil self takes over

2868
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
And the space Harrier

2869
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Which you know is set in the same universe right?

2870
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Opa Opa tries to go to knock his ass out

2871
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
And Opa Opa kills him

2872
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Funny enough that was also the ending

2873
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I'm sorry to spoil this guys

2874
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
But that's also the ending to A Star is Born

2875
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Is that Gaga turns evil

2876
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
And turns into the evil leader of the planet

2877
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
And makes everybody bow down and say

2878
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Yes Gaga yes

2879
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
That's basically what it is

2880
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
And then she interrupts my Fantasy Zone music

2881
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
And then Changela comes out of the box

2882
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Yes Hallelu

2883
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Anyway

2884
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
So basically the story of this

2885
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Is in the year 1432

2886
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Space year 1432

2887
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Ten years after

2888
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Ten years after

2889
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Fantasy Zone

2890
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Opa Opa has to go in

2891
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
And save the Fantasy Zone again

2892
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
So the mastermind of this

2893
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Is an evil version of himself

2894
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
And then after winning

2895
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
God Smooshy what?

2896
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Can we hear him?

2897
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
I don't think he picks up on the mic

2898
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Mr. Smoosh is throwing a fit

2899
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
He's screaming

2900
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Anyway Opa Opa's father comes out to

2901
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Comfort him

2902
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
And Opa Opa cries

2903
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
And so the evil Opa Opa vanishes

2904
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Mr. Smoosh is just playing along

2905
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
And he's singing along

2906
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
But you get to see Opa Opa's daddy

2907
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Which is a big ginormous Opa Opa

2908
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Alright well Mr. Smoosh's daddy is going to go over there and tell him to shut the fuck up

2909
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
I'll be back

2910
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
So anyway as I said

2911
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
You play kind of Defender Style

2912
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Indefinitely

2913
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
And you can travel freely

2914
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
You've got different bases that you have to knock down

2915
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
And you pick up coins

2916
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
And you can go into secret shops to buy stuff

2917
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
But now what's new in this one

2918
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Is that you get different warps that are hidden behind

2919
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Certain bases that let you travel to different zones

2920
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
So you have three different zones

2921
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
And when all of the bases have

2922
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
disappeared and all three of the zones

2923
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Are available

2924
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Then you can go through a warp to get to the boss

2925
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Now the boss fights are just simply

2926
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Like the way that they were in fantasy zones

2927
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Where you have to kind of be

2928
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Sort of bullet hellish

2929
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
You know shooting at big bossy things

2930
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
And then

2931
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
They are super huge and they change color

2932
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
And then your last stage is a boss rush

2933
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Which is kind of a pain in the ass

2934
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
So you get different types of attacks

2935
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
You have a fire and you have a bomb

2936
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
The bomb kind of drops

2937
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Like in an arc

2938
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
But it is more powerful and has a shorter range

2939
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
You get the shops like I said

2940
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
You can get different weapons

2941
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Bombs, speeds, extra lives

2942
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
You get the large wing

2943
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
And the jet engine

2944
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
The large one is probably one of my favorite ones

2945
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
So the ones that upgrade

2946
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Over open speed are permanent

2947
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
As long as you do not die

2948
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Weapon upgrades are time limited

2949
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
And the bombs have a limited number

2950
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
So here's where we get to the fun part

2951
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
All the ports

2952
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
So it passes into our cave

2953
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
The first one is based on system A

2954
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
So it is almost identical to master system version

2955
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
It does have the radar that shows

2956
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
The base of the destroyer pod

2957
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
And of course

2958
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
It has a timer because

2959
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Pretty much kind of like

2960
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Like those play choice games I guess

2961
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
The internet

2962
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
The Famicom version

2963
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
That came out actually has

2964
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
A kind of different name

2965
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
It's called the teardrop of Oppa Oppa

2966
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
So now we have the big one

2967
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Which really is the one that I wanted to talk about

2968
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
So now keep in mind

2969
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
The first one came out

2970
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
In what did I say

2971
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
2000 not 2000

2972
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
1987 right

2973
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
So in 2008

2974
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
So 10 years ago

2975
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
They

2976
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Re-released the game

2977
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
They did it in the system 16

2978
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Which is

2979
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Basically the

2980
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Same original hardware

2981
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
It was

2982
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
It was developed by M2

2983
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
And it's not really

2984
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
They didn't want to modernize the older one

2985
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
They wanted to do a hypothetical interpretation

2986
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Of what the game would have been like

2987
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Had it been developed for

2988
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
System 16 arcade hardware

2989
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
By the original staff

2990
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
That's kind of neat though

2991
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
It is

2992
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
So instead of using the Sega console

2993
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
R&D system

2994
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
And system E board for the system 16

2995
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
It was called a what if remake

2996
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
And basically it adhered

2997
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Strictly to the limitations

2998
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
From the time that fantasy M2

2999
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Was originally released

3000
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
But with the arcade hardware

3001
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
At that point

3002
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
So M2 developed it on a real

3003
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
System 16 hardware

3004
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Except that it had expanded memory

3005
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
256 kilobytes

3006
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
So it was called

3007
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
They dubbed it system 16c

3008
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Well I mean that was pretty hot shit for

3009
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
No yeah for that time

3010
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Now it's just funny like 256 kilobytes

3011
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
It's like I have word documents

3012
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
That are far bigger than that you know

3013
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
It's crazy

3014
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
On top of that it actually can be played

3015
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Via emulation

3016
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
And on top of that it shows a 1987

3017
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Sega copyright and makes no mention

3018
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Of M2

3019
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
So it really

3020
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
And I played the system 16 arcade remake

3021
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
I played it at

3022
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
California extreme

3023
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
I played the shit out of it at California

3024
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Extreme cause I fucking love some Fantasy Zone

3025
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
And when I first looked at it

3026
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
If I hadn't seen it say the tears of

3027
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Oppa Oppa I would have thought I was

3028
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
About to play the real Fantasy Zone

3029
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
And I was like oh wait shit this is

3030
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
That one

3031
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
So it's been nicknamed by fans

3032
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Fantasy Zone 2DX

3033
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Nice

3034
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
So it follows the original one

3035
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Kinda loosely it has the enemies

3036
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Music locations and gameplay from

3037
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Master System game that has

3038
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
New content and elements that went

3039
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
With the original Fantasy Zone it's actually kinda why I like

3040
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
This one better cause it's more like the original Fantasy Zone

3041
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
So level structure is the

3042
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Same so instead of distinct zones that you

3043
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Have to beat you actually have portals

3044
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
That take you into parallel dimensions

3045
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
You have the bright side and the dark side

3046
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
And they're comparable to the levels

3047
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Of the first Fantasy Zone

3048
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
So you can destroy them in each dimension

3049
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Jeez okay

3050
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
So bases

3051
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
That are destroyed in one dimension will be destroyed in the other

3052
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
So you can clear entirely on one level

3053
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Of the other but the dark side is more

3054
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Difficult but you get greater rewards

3055
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
And points and money

3056
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
The bosses are the same on either side

3057
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
But they have a more difficult

3058
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Attack pattern on the dark side

3059
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
It also has three endings

3060
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Based on which

3061
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
On both whether the dark side levels

3062
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Were cleared and whether certain specific

3063
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Items were purchased so that's where

3064
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
You get like the you know daddy comes

3065
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
And helps Oppa Oppa

3066
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
And then evil Oppa Oppa

3067
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Takes over and there's like one more

3068
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
The music was done by

3069
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Manabu Namiki

3070
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Sorry Manabu Namiki

3071
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
That uses

3072
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Some of the songs from

3073
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
The original Fantasy Zone 2 soundtrack

3074
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
But rearranged to fit more

3075
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Like Kawaguchi Hiroshi's

3076
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
First Fantasy Zone style so

3077
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
And there's a few original tracks

3078
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
That were made for it

3079
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
It's based off of some of the same

3080
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Games

3081
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
The

3082
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Bosses there are some new ones for here

3083
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
It's just sort of like again a loose interpretation

3084
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
It's kind of like arena

3085
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
So it has been bootlegged and re-released

3086
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
To the arcades

3087
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
As FZ-2006-2

3088
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
By a Taiwanese manufacturer

3089
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Called ISG

3090
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
As a 2006 copyright date

3091
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
But it's directly

3092
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Derived from the Playstation 2 release

3093
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
It also has the ROM data

3094
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
From the PS2 version

3095
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Sega did

3096
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Actually produce

3097
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Real arcade units running the System 16

3098
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Hardware as part of the promotion

3099
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
So there's a Nintendo 3DS

3100
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Port of this version

3101
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
16-bit version that came out in Japan

3102
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
In 2014 and internationally

3103
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
In 2015 and it's called 3D Fantasy

3104
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Zone 2W

3105
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
You also have

3106
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Another game mode in this one

3107
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
It's called Loop Land

3108
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Where it's an endless survival mode

3109
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Starring Oppa Oppa's brother Oppa Oppa

3110
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Oppa Oppa and Oppa Oppa

3111
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Oppa Oppa and Oppa Oppa

3112
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Oppa Oppa

3113
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
I just always laugh at Oppa Oppa

3114
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Because I don't know if his name is supposed to be a ton on boobs

3115
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Oppai

3116
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Or if it's like Oppa

3117
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
You know the Greek cheer

3118
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
I think it's also a Korean word for brother

3119
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Because I used to have a friend in high school

3120
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Random question

3121
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
So there you go

3122
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
It is one of the best games

3123
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Ever made Fantasy Zone 2

3124
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
And as much

3125
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
As much as I

3126
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
I have a lot of fucking love for this game

3127
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
And if someone wants to find me

3128
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
The Sega Ages Fantasy Zone box

3129
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Will work something out

3130
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Alright

3131
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
She'll go Oppa Oppa for it

3132
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Also

3133
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
I'm mad because Dan guessed

3134
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
One of the games I got him

3135
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
And I can't lie

3136
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
He guessed that I got him the treasure box

3137
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
So when is his birthday?

3138
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
It's November 29th

3139
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Oh gosh so are you making him wait?

3140
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
I'm making him wait

3141
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
That's what he gets

3142
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Guess what he got though for us?

3143
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
On the 27th he got us tickets to see the

3144
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
40th anniversary

3145
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Theater showing a superman

3146
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
That's kind of cool

3147
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Very cool

3148
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Last game of the week Fantasy Zone 2

3149
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
The Tears of Oppa Oppa

3150
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Poor Oppa Oppa don't cry

3151
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
We're running long so we gotta wrap up

3152
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
So any last words for the week Dark Sakura?

3153
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
I like big butts

3154
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
And I cannot lie

3155
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
You other brothers can't deny

3156
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I'm kidding

3157
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I don't like big butts

3158
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Unless they're like rump roasts

3159
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
I'm done

3160
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
And we're back in the present

3161
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Where sadly Dark Sakura did not

3162
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
end up coming out as a nun

3163
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Delvin didn't get to see that because unfortunately

3164
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
I think she got a little sick before

3165
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
we went out last night

3166
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
I was taking Delvin around

3167
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
I'm trying to think of how to give Delvin this Sacramento

3168
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
experience because we don't exactly have

3169
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
a lot. It's not like Disneyland

3170
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
is in this part of California

3171
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Disneyland is like six hours

3172
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
from here. It's a long way away

3173
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
It's pretty far

3174
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
So I was like well we'll go to Old Town

3175
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
That'll be fun

3176
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
We'll go to the Capitol

3177
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
I actually taught Delvin a little bit about

3178
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
American government today

3179
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Which is very confusing by the way

3180
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Especially if you've watched the news this past week

3181
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
You're especially looking at it going

3182
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
How did any of this happen?

3183
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
It's so confusing

3184
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
US politics is just very confusing

3185
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Canadian politics which I feel is a little bit more

3186
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
simplistic in its design

3187
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
But ask any of us to explain

3188
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Canadian politics and we couldn't do it

3189
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
I doubt I barely could

3190
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
I would bet there would be so many Americans that would be like

3191
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Justin Trudeau is the president of Canada, right?

3192
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Probably

3193
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Well, no

3194
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Prime Minister, but close

3195
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Close, as far as

3196
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
delegations

3197
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
It's got to be equivalent, but it's not the same

3198
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Anyway

3199
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
To register participation for this

3200
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at

3201
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
vognetwork.com, use the passphrase

3202
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Family

3203
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Speaking of like adventures and

3204
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
being here in Sacramento

3205
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
So you've listened to OLR sometimes

3206
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
And now you're here, what should people at home

3207
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
know about what

3208
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
OLR is really like in person?

3209
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
It's just what it sounds like

3210
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
That's good

3211
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
I guess that's good, that means we're authentic

3212
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
That's good, alright, it's an authentic product

3213
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
I appreciate that

3214
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Good, alright

3215
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
And you're even getting to sit in Jamie's chair

3216
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
I feel very special

3217
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
It's the nicest chair in the room, isn't it?

3218
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
That's why I picked it

3219
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Nothing but the finest for our out of town guests

3220
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Alright, looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com

3221
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
SSG100Matt says

3222
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
I thought the Sacramento experience was watching

3223
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Lady Bird

3224
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
You know, as

3225
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
somebody who's lived here his entire life

3226
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
I did watch that movie and I was

3227
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
obviously I nitpicked some of the

3228
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
little things, but I was like, yeah

3229
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
honestly, they got it

3230
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
They

3231
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
really got it, and like the whole story

3232
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
of her really spoke to me

3233
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
because I too applied to go to college

3234
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
back east, it's just

3235
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
I didn't get in

3236
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Aww

3237
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
My life turned out okay, it's all good

3238
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
I also learned in college that college

3239
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
wasn't for me, and that's what happens

3240
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
sometimes, college isn't for everybody, so

3241
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Sometimes I just don't think people should go

3242
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
college right after high school

3243
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
I think that is, well that's a

3244
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
big reason why community college is a thing

3245
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
because, and some people have joked and called

3246
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
community college 13th grade, but

3247
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
actually I think it really is like a good

3248
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
transition type of thing, so I think

3249
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
community college is really underrated in

3250
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
many ways, but anyway, it is not that kind of

3251
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
show, although I

3252
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
do associate, you know what I associate community college

3253
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
with? The altered beast machine

3254
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
that was at the cafeteria at the community college

3255
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
I went to and took like one or two

3256
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
classes at during the summer, they

3257
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
had an altered beast machine, it was awesome

3258
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
There you go

3259
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
What? What?

3260
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
I guess I live a primitive life up in Canada

3261
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Apparently, my god, you

3262
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
really do all live in igloos with no power

3263
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
don't you

3264
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Alright

3265
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Alright, let's move on, let's get into some

3266
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
rapid fire news, Loki

3267
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
So there's more rumors regarding

3268
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Microsoft releasing

3269
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
a streaming platform

3270
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
as a new console possibly

3271
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
next year, they're

3272
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
saying that

3273
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
the rumors are that this

3274
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
console quality game

3275
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
streaming platform for phones and other

3276
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
devices will be released

3277
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
sometime as early as

3278
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
quarter one of, or quarter two

3279
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
of next year, and

3280
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
they're saying that there's possibly going to be an

3281
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
announcement at EXO

3282
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
2018 in November

3283
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
So I guess we'll have to

3284
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
wait and see if that actually

3285
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
ends up being a thing

3286
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
They don't really have a streaming

3287
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
platform

3288
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I feel like it's not a void they really need to

3289
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
fill, because they have game pass

3290
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
which is pretty rad, but

3291
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
okay, I mean if they

3292
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
But what if you could do game pass on devices that

3293
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
if you don't have an Xbox

3294
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Yeah, I think that's the direction

3295
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Microsoft, and we've heard this rumor before

3296
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
that the next Xbox

3297
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
is there's going to be one super

3298
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Xbox, but then there's going to be a baby

3299
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Xbox that just basically does the online

3300
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Yeah, so I

3301
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
one of the things that I think the direction

3302
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Microsoft is going, and probably

3303
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
all consoles will be going in the future

3304
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
is no longer having us

3305
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
like a new generation

3306
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
and then creating a segmented

3307
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
user base, so

3308
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I think that they're planning to have

3309
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
whatever next console Microsoft

3310
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
comes out with the more powerful

3311
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
and whatever the case may be, but those games

3312
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
that come out for it will work on your

3313
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
original Xbox, but will scale

3314
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
in the same way that you

3315
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
buy a PC game, and even if you

3316
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
are playing it on your laptop with

3317
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
no video card, it will still work

3318
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
or just like

3319
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
you have Pokemon Go

3320
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
on your iPhone, and it will work

3321
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
on your iPhone 5, 6

3322
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
7, 8, it doesn't matter

3323
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
it just scales correctly, so

3324
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
this streaming method

3325
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
might be one of the ways in which they

3326
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
allow those more powerful games to

3327
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
run on the older systems, you just

3328
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
stream it. Well you know a story that didn't

3329
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
make our show roll tonight has to do with the fact that

3330
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
the Switch is exploiting, like Capcom's

3331
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
looking at doing something like

3332
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Resident Evil 7 with maybe

3333
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
more of their games, because you may or may not

3334
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
know, but in Japan, there's more of these

3335
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
streaming games on the Switch, and that's how

3336
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
they've put Resident Evil 7 on it

3337
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
and Assassin's Creed Odyssey came out

3338
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
on the Switch in Japan. And Phantasy Star Online

3339
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
2. Oh that's right!

3340
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Is a streaming

3341
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
stream game. God that pisses me off.

3342
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
That's not open, that can of worms.

3343
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
I want to play that game so bad,

3344
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
and they just refuse to release it in the US.

3345
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Sega, what's your fucking problem?

3346
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Like seriously.

3347
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
I have so much fond memories of that

3348
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
game, but I just want to play the second one

3349
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
so bad. Same.

3350
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Anyway, sorry Logi.

3351
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
So, I think

3352
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
it's a neat idea on paper, but

3353
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
like, you know, are

3354
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
the United, you know,

3355
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
North American

3356
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
internet infrastructures

3357
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
going to be able to handle something like this?

3358
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
I don't, I'm

3359
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
kind of concerned that, no,

3360
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
they can't. I

3361
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
would, well, okay, but remember

3362
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
we live in Sacramento, and

3363
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
one of the things that we're getting here, that

3364
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
very few cities in America are getting because we're in

3365
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
a test program, they just rolled out 5G here.

3366
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Now sadly, not where OLR Studios

3367
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
is located, because this is in the downtown

3368
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
part, and I'm not going to give out my address on

3369
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
air, but I don't live downtown.

3370
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
So, the downtown area is really

3371
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
where a lot of this is going in, because they put all the

3372
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
boxes on phone poles. So, I mean, 5G

3373
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
is going to give you wirelessly

3374
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
like what cable internet gives

3375
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
you. So,

3376
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
here's the thing, in five years from now,

3377
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Logi, the internet like that is only

3378
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
going to get better, and 5G is going to roll out more

3379
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
and more places. Will places like

3380
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
rural Alaska

3381
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
have that type of internet? Probably

3382
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
not, but you know what?

3383
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
I mean, they

3384
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
were probably still on dial-up

3385
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
up to a few years ago, but it's progressed.

3386
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
It's not so much the speeds. I mean,

3387
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
speeds definitely, we need improvements

3388
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
there, but it's also bandwidth caps

3389
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
for no fucking reason.

3390
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Well, I kind of think

3391
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
that argument is going to have to

3392
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
give a little bit as more and

3393
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
more people start getting too close to

3394
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
that cap, but cable is really

3395
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
probably assessing the situation right now. Like, a

3396
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
company like Comcast is

3397
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
definitely going. Like, the days

3398
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
of cable as a television

3399
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
delivery service are limited. Like,

3400
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
that is dying. You know,

3401
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
again, maybe in rural parts

3402
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
where there isn't as fast of internet and so forth,

3403
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
maybe there's still a need there, but

3404
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
again, a lot of those people have had satellite

3405
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
for the longest time. But, you know, people,

3406
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
more and more people are ditching cable

3407
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
channels to watch their shows on

3408
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Netflix, or this is why

3409
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
as much as people hate on CBS

3410
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
All Access, it exists

3411
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
because CBS saw this coming a long

3412
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
time ago. So, they were trying to

3413
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
future-proof against, you know what?

3414
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
People aren't going to be getting CBS on cable.

3415
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
They're not going to be getting it over the air.

3416
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
So, we need to, you know, adopt

3417
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
this Netflix-style thing, like, fast

3418
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
because that is where it's going.

3419
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
So, one of the things I

3420
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
have noticed recently

3421
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
in terms of infrastructure

3422
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
and internet and TV and all that sort of thing,

3423
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
all the,

3424
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
in Canada, the providers now,

3425
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
all the internet plans don't

3426
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
have, most of them don't have caps anymore.

3427
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
They're all just unlimited.

3428
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
They just limit the speed at which you get

3429
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
the internet now. Oh, hooray. Another reason

3430
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
why Canada is better than the United States.

3431
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Like, as if everything.

3432
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Why can't we just live in Canada? I mean,

3433
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
seriously. You can if you want to.

3434
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
It's a bit of a process. Actually, do you know, I was like,

3435
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
do you know how hard it is for an American to be going to Canada?

3436
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Because, you know, there's a lot of people this week

3437
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
that are like, I'm going to move to Canada because fuck

3438
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
this place. And, you know what?

3439
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
I completely understand

3440
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
that as a reaction. But when you

3441
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
sit down and you really start to plot

3442
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
it out, you're like, oh shit, that's really hard

3443
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
to do. It's complicated. And

3444
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
it's also one of those things, and I

3445
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
don't want to get political, but it's also one of those where I also

3446
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
kind of feel like, no, this is my fucking

3447
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
country too. And we are going

3448
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
to fucking fix this problem.

3449
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
So that's also my kind of perspective, but that's my

3450
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
I will get on that high horse at a later time.

3451
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
So anyway. But anyway, so

3452
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
the, uh, most of the plans are

3453
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
trending towards no cap. So that's

3454
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
one issue for this streaming service gone

3455
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
out the window. Um,

3456
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
the major issue will be the

3457
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
cap, or so not the cap, the

3458
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
bandwidth or rate at which you can

3459
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
download it and upload. Because

3460
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
if you don't have good up download, then you're screwed for the

3461
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
streaming service. But I think it's more something

3462
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
that is going to be as a premium service. So it's not

3463
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
meant to be for,

3464
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
you know, Tom in Alaska, who's,

3465
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
you know, he needs to actually

3466
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
purchase the game in order to play it.

3467
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
He can't stream it. Which could easily be said

3468
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
to for people north of you in Canada,

3469
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
because there's a lot of, a lot of place

3470
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
in Canada that probably don't have these fast Internet's.

3471
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Yeah, very, very true. Um, and

3472
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
one of the things like you mentioned with the TV,

3473
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
um, so one of the, uh,

3474
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
television, major television providers,

3475
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
CTV, uh, in

3476
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Canada did their promos

3477
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
in all the subway stations for,

3478
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
you know, the fall lineup and stuff.

3479
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Normally they'll say, oh, this

3480
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
show is airing, uh,

3481
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
you know, Thursdays at nine.

3482
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Uh, one of the key

3483
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
things I noticed that they did, uh,

3484
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
in their advertising is they said it is

3485
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
now streaming at

3486
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
such and such a time. Yeah.

3487
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
They, they emphasize that

3488
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
it's not something

3489
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
that's live. It's available for

3490
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
streaming at this time and this

3491
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
date. Yeah. So again, trending in

3492
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
the direction of you just now are just going to

3493
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
get everything on the Internet. Yeah.

3494
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
No, it's interesting stuff. It's

3495
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
going to be really interesting to see where we are in the future.

3496
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
I mean, to put it in perspective,

3497
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
one other little tidbit that I think you guys, some of you

3498
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
are going to find funny. When OLR

3499
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
first started in 2002,

3500
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
this was before VOG Network

3501
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
was a thing. This was before All Games Radio

3502
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
where we were at previously was a thing.

3503
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
When OLR was a

3504
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
station where this show was

3505
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
the kind of centerpiece of the station,

3506
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
that's what it was originally intended.

3507
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
One of the pitches of our station

3508
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
because we were kind of, and I'm using my quoting fingers,

3509
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
competing with DDR

3510
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Freak Radio, but we really weren't.

3511
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Like we were two peas in a pod, right?

3512
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
But our thing was

3513
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
where as DDR Freak Radio was all high

3514
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
speed, we were dial-up friendly

3515
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
radio when we started.

3516
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
So something to think about. When this show started,

3517
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
there was still enough need out there

3518
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
for there to be dial-up friendly streams

3519
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
that you could listen to. And

3520
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
there's a reason why I'm called Potato

3521
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
because this show sounded like a Potato

3522
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
if you go back to episode one, because it's saved

3523
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
in that dial-up quality. But that's the

3524
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
reality, is that the internet has progressed

3525
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
that much, even since then.

3526
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
And it will continue to progress even

3527
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
faster, even in the next five years.

3528
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
As far as this show is concerned,

3529
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
even in the next three months, because

3530
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
whereas we upgraded from

3531
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
24 kbps,

3532
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
the dial-up standard or whatever it was,

3533
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
to 96, which we're using on VoG,

3534
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
now we're going to be going to Twitch.

3535
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
As more and more people now

3536
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
can just watch video on their phones.

3537
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
This is not something we could have considered doing

3538
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
a few years ago, even.

3539
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
You know what I mean?

3540
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
So, again, with this streaming service, it's kind of

3541
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
just, I guess, them setting the groundwork

3542
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
and infrastructure for something that

3543
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
will be more readily

3544
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
available in five years.

3545
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Anyway, rapid-fire news, and we just spent

3546
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
probably the longest on that topic, but that's alright.

3547
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
It was good talk.

3548
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
I love how you say sorry.

3549
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
So, PUBG over the last

3550
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
14 months has banned 13 million

3551
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
users.

3552
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
That's one way to get your

3553
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
subscription numbers out. Well, most of

3554
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
the people that were kicked off the service

3555
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
were using cheat tools.

3556
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
And then

3557
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
apparently that's a common problem.

3558
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Well, I would assume so, if you've kicked off

3559
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
13 million people.

3560
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
They've, of course, been

3561
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
patching the game to fight against these

3562
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
tools, but then there's also

3563
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
aimbots and whatnot.

3564
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
But these were the numbers

3565
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
that were coming out from Bluehole

3566
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
and the Korean

3567
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
PUBG Cafe board.

3568
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
That's an

3569
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
interesting statistic.

3570
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Yeah.

3571
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Maybe the rampant

3572
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
cheating is one of the reasons why PUBG

3573
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
has fallen in the rankings. I don't know.

3574
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
But I don't play the game or Fortnite

3575
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
enough to really get into that stan war.

3576
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
So, but it's just, it's interesting

3577
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
they've had to ban that many accounts, and is that really gonna

3578
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
stop them? As Jason said in the intro,

3579
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
one goes down, two more

3580
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
come up, you know? Well, I think one of the things

3581
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
that killed the PUBG

3582
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
userbase was the amount of

3583
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
people that they were banning

3584
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
for stream sniping,

3585
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
quote unquote, but weren't

3586
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
actually stream sniping. Oh.

3587
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Remember that whole thing? Yeah, I do.

3588
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
That really killed that community. Yeah, that was...

3589
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
And that was right when Fortnite came out.

3590
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
So, people were getting pissed off from one

3591
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
and jumping right to the other. Well, but then the

3592
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
other big thing was that Fortnite's Battle Royale

3593
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
was free, and PUBG cost money.

3594
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
And I think, honestly, it's really not much

3595
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
more difficult than that.

3596
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
I think for a lot, but you're right, that other

3597
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
situation certainly didn't help. And the quality of

3598
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
the game, it looks like too, like PUBG

3599
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
it's not really as flat.

3600
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
It's kind of like comparing, I guess,

3601
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
like, you know, it's not Overwatch

3602
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
where Overwatch, you know, has

3603
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
this like really flashy

3604
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
art style and everything that, you know,

3605
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Fortnite has, whereas PUBG's kind of

3606
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
meh. It's

3607
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
serves its purpose. It's trying to go a little more

3608
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
for the realistic angle. Yeah, but...

3609
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
To make success. Yeah, no, I get it.

3610
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
I get it. Alright. Anyhow,

3611
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
let's move on to some other rapid fire news

3612
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
including a game that's several years old

3613
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
at this point, which is interesting because

3614
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
it's a remake of a game that's many years old.

3615
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
But it's one of my favorite classics.

3616
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
The game Shadowgate from the

3617
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Nintendo Entertainment System. Did you ever play Shadowgate, Delvin?

3618
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Never heard of it. Oh, and the music is really

3619
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
good. It was like a PC game

3620
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
they kind of put out on the NES.

3621
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Where, like, you use the

3622
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
controller as a mouse, basically.

3623
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
And, yeah, it's kind of neat. Anyway, they

3624
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
remade it a few years ago and

3625
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
I actually was a Kickstarter backer. It's one of the

3626
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
very few Kickstarters I ever did.

3627
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
But I was like, somebody wants to make a

3628
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
new Shadowgate game? Fuck yes, take my money.

3629
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Because this was before we really started

3630
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
learning about all the issues with Kickstarter.

3631
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
And, you know what, to be fair, these guys

3632
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
they did the game. They delivered on what

3633
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
they promised. It's out there.

3634
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
So, uh, and they're going to keep it going

3635
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
because this new Shadowgate

3636
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
version is going to be coming to the Nintendo Switch

3637
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
this autumn. So they're putting out

3638
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
the new Shadowgate on the Switch.

3639
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
It is based on the newer PC version

3640
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
that came out a couple years ago, but they're going to enhance it

3641
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
with a new user interface and

3642
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
a wheel-based command system, some other

3643
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
new features and elements as well. So

3644
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
that is pretty cool.

3645
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Also, speaking of the Nintendo stuff,

3646
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
remember the Switch Online

3647
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Classic Nintendo library?

3648
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
We knew we were going to be getting more games

3649
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
in October, but we didn't quite know when.

3650
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Well, now we know. Those new games

3651
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
will be arriving on October 10th.

3652
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
So Super Dodgeball,

3653
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
NES Open Tournament Golf, and

3654
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Sullivan's Key will be arriving on

3655
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
October 10th. And if I were to rank

3656
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
those, I would say probably Super

3657
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Dodgeball is going to be the best, especially with the

3658
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
online play. That was a really,

3659
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
uh, it's kind of the art style

3660
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
of River City Ransom, and it has a very

3661
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
particular name in Japan, and somebody

3662
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
in chat will beat me to it. But, um...

3663
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
You needed a multi-tap to play

3664
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
that, because it's four players, wasn't it?

3665
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
I don't think so. You could play two-player.

3666
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
It might have supported the four-player

3667
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
thing, but it was two-player. I think it did.

3668
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
But it was like, imagine the River City Ransom guys are playing

3669
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Dodgeball, and it was really well done.

3670
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
The definitive version is on the Neo Geo,

3671
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
honestly, but the NES version

3672
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
is not bad. Because they were playing,

3673
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
thinking way back, they were playing

3674
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
this on

3675
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
stage when they were doing the

3676
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Nintendo World Championships

3677
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
in the Oakland Coliseum.

3678
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
They were playing the four-player version of

3679
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Dodgeball.

3680
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
I remember when I was trying to do the

3681
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
preliminary

3682
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
trial thing, where you had to play the three games.

3683
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
And then I would rank

3684
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
number two as Solomon's Key.

3685
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Some people would probably put that in first place,

3686
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
but I think that was a pretty competent puzzler game

3687
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
that was on the NES. And number three,

3688
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
of course, the golf game. Trash.

3689
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Sorry, just my opinion.

3690
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
It is. It is.

3691
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Does Nintendo have Nintendo Golf on there already?

3692
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Uh, the actual NES Golf?

3693
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
No, it is not there.

3694
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
So this is what you're getting instead.

3695
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Oh, on the NES Classic

3696
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
service, but there wasn't that

3697
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
golf thing that they did, someone

3698
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Oh, it was, uh, that was

3699
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
the hidden game. The hidden game was golf.

3700
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
That was the Iwata thing that somebody

3701
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
found in there was the original 8-bit

3702
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
NES Golf. That's what you're thinking about.

3703
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
That actually, for some reason, was not

3704
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
put on the Nintendo Classic service, and they're

3705
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
doing this instead, so I don't know.

3706
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
This is a golf game from much later in the NES's life.

3707
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Oh, it's not that golf game.

3708
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
No, it is not. It's a Mario golf game.

3709
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
It's basically that, but insert Mario.

3710
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Which, to think about it, if I seem to remember

3711
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
the original guy kind of looked like Mario,

3712
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
but it wasn't officially him.

3713
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
But there's a very different look to this game.

3714
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
So, uh, anyway.

3715
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
D'Artesia said, I assume that we won't

3716
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
get original NES Golf.

3717
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
I don't know. They may still do that at some point.

3718
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
And D'Artesia says, I do

3719
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
remember having Solomon's Key back in the day.

3720
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Actually, I owned it too, believe it or not.

3721
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
So they're not gonna do the original golf because it's

3722
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
gonna take so much programming stuff

3723
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
for them to get to work. They can't just, like,

3724
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
dump in a ROM or anything like that?

3725
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
We're not doing this again.

3726
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
I'm just checking, because it seems like

3727
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
it's an awful lot of work for Nintendo.

3728
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Not today, Satan. Delvin is here,

3729
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
and we are going to have

3730
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
a good time, dammit!

3731
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Alright.

3732
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Let's move on and talk about what's coming

3733
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
out in stores this week. Loki,

3734
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
what will we be playing a little sooner than

3735
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
NES Golf on the Switch?

3736
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
And then the World Ends With You final

3737
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
remix. Is it really the final remix?

3738
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Is it really the final one?

3739
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
The final for now. Final for now.

3740
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Nintendo Switch. It's final, like, as in the

3741
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Final Fantasy for the

3742
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Nintendo Switch. And that

3743
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
is what we're getting.

3744
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Alright, let's travel to Japan. And over

3745
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
in Japan, they're gonna be getting a game called

3746
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Varnir of the Dragon Star,

3747
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Exodus of the Dragon

3748
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
that comes out in a regular and limited edition.

3749
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Middle Earth Shadow of War

3750
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
that's a price reduction in Japan this week as it

3751
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
moves into the definitive edition.

3752
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Tactical Assault Commander

3753
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
comes out as well, with a variety

3754
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
of different little controllers and things like that.

3755
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
And believe it or not, Call of Duty

3756
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Black Ops 4, you know, they're going pretty

3757
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
hard in Japan with that as well, so they

3758
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
get a release the same day we do,

3759
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
as well as Europe, so that's all on the same

3760
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
day. So Japan won't miss out on that.

3761
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
But they're actually also getting a blue

3762
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
camouflage dual-shot

3763
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
controller as well. And then

3764
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
there are new PlayStation 4 pros

3765
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
in Glacier White and Jet Black.

3766
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
I don't think these are Call of Duty themed, I think they just

3767
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
happen to be the same day. But there's Glacier White

3768
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
and Jet Black pros with a one terabyte

3769
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
hard drive also coming out that day.

3770
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
And there is also a brand new

3771
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
PlayStation VR bundle in

3772
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Japan, so kind of

3773
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
setting the stage for end-of-the-year

3774
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
releases. Not really holiday releases in Japan

3775
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
because Christmas isn't quite the same thing

3776
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
that it is here, but I would say

3777
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
end-of-the-year kind of positioning.

3778
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
That is Japan. Dark Soccer

3779
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
is not here for the UK, but maybe you can help out

3780
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Logie? Sure.

3781
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
So this week we're getting Space Hulk

3782
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Tactics on PlayStation 4 and

3783
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Xbox One, WWE 2K19

3784
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
on PC, PlayStation 4

3785
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
and Xbox One. Goosebumps

3786
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
the game on the Switch.

3787
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
They're getting a bridge

3788
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
constructor compilation

3789
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
that's both the bridge

3790
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
constructor portal and the original

3791
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
bridge constructor that's on PlayStation 4.

3792
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
A game called My

3793
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Riding Stables Life with Horses

3794
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
on PlayStation 4 and the Switch.

3795
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Call of Duty

3796
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
Black Ops 4 on PlayStation 4

3797
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Xbox One and PC.

3798
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
And last but not least

3799
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
The World Ends with You final remix on the

3800
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Switch. Okie dokie.

3801
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Well before we get back into some news

3802
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
we're going to take some time out to read

3803
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
some of your emails.

3804
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Every

3805
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
week you guys email us. Participate at

3806
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com and we read some

3807
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
of those emails live here on the air.

3808
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Actually we're pretty good about reading them all

3809
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
unless they're just way way

3810
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
way too long or off topic or something like

3811
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
that, but we read them all.

3812
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
You get to be here for a mail bag segment, Delman.

3813
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Isn't that exciting? Yes. And we actually have some

3814
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
emails tonight. You ready for it? Alright.

3815
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
I should have made you read them. That would have been fun. Alright.

3816
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Anyway, the first email tonight

3817
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
is from DJ Rama S.

3818
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
I've never heard of this guy. He must be

3819
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
a new listener.

3820
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Long time listener. First time caller.

3821
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
How about that? Alright. Obviously I'm teasing.

3822
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
We love Rama. So the email

3823
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
goes like this. Evening everyone.

3824
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
I hope all is good. Two weeks ago

3825
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
I tried to call into the show, but I just missed

3826
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
the Skyplinas. I just got off the train.

3827
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
So if you bear with me, I have a few things to say.

3828
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Number one. Telltale Games.

3829
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
First of all, I feel really bad about

3830
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
the employees losing their jobs like that.

3831
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
It sucks that this seems to be the norm in

3832
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
the industry when it shouldn't be. What

3833
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
bothers me is how upper management surprised

3834
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
everyone about it. How do you go from

3835
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
hiring people to firing people in a week?

3836
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
I really think that upper management

3837
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
has been finageling

3838
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
the books. But hey,

3839
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
what do I know? I have

3840
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
this really weird feeling.

3841
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Give it about like six months

3842
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
and there's going to be a lot of those employees

3843
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
who are going to squawk. And we're going to

3844
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
like there's going to be books written about

3845
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
the fucking ups and fucking

3846
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
downs of Telltale Games.

3847
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Because, seriously, open Twitter.

3848
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
And they're already

3849
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
like there's just a lot. I got something

3850
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
to say. And you know what?

3851
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
And I'm not making fun of it. Like

3852
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
I bet there's a lot

3853
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
of things that have built up that people

3854
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
have wanted to say. So I'm very let

3855
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
it out. Let it out y'all. Someone

3856
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
needs to make a docu-series about

3857
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
the gaming industry in general of

3858
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
like past employees. And

3859
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
one of them that I want to hear from, of course,

3860
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
is Kojima. You know,

3861
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
I would love

3862
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
to see some type of documentary

3863
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
that's very real about the game.

3864
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
I'm sure there's been some, you know, if

3865
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
you can think of it, it's been done, I'm sure.

3866
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
So I'm sure there's documentaries on YouTube

3867
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
and things like that about the gaming industry. But I would

3868
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
like somebody who's like really a renowned

3869
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
like documentary filmmaker. And I'm not thinking

3870
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
about like Michael Moore because he's a bit partisan.

3871
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
But he's very well known for his documentaries.

3872
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
But I'm thinking maybe a little more like how

3873
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
do you remember when you saw Super Size Me?

3874
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
I don't know if you ever saw that movie. What was that guy's name?

3875
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Spurlock made that movie.

3876
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
And it really opened people's eyes

3877
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
to like, wow,

3878
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
this is why I'm fat.

3879
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
And just how McDonald's was really

3880
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
pushing a lot of this stuff and the industry

3881
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
in general, you know, not to pick on McDonald's, but maybe

3882
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
a little bit. And it even made McDonald's change

3883
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
some of their policies that they no longer

3884
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
would ask, you know, you want to super size

3885
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
it. And I think eventually they got rid of that and that

3886
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
whole thing. And you've even commented on this before

3887
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
about how like a medium drink here is like a large.

3888
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Yeah, it's crazy, right?

3889
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
So anyway, the reason why I say that is that I would like a documentary

3890
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
like that, but about

3891
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
what really happens in the gaming industry.

3892
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
How a game is really made from start to finish.

3893
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Yes. And I want it to be

3894
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
something that I could be comfortable saying.

3895
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
I 100%

3896
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
support anybody starting

3897
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
a gaming podcast. I want

3898
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
voices to be out there. I want everybody to be

3899
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
heard, but you need to

3900
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
watch this documentary first

3901
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
before you just start blindly saying this game

3902
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
sucks. These people suck. All this

3903
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
sucks. Like I want a documentary

3904
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
that I'm going to feel comfortable saying

3905
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
I support you doing this, but

3906
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
first, you need to put your shoes

3907
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
in, or you need to put yourself in the shoes of

3908
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
somebody who's really in this. You know what I mean?

3909
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
So anyway. Give some perspective to the gaming

3910
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
internet. Yeah, for real.

3911
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Anyway, actdeft in chat says

3912
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
granted super size me was kind of a hoax.

3913
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Okay, look, I realize there's always going to be

3914
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
controversy with documentaries. There's always going to be

3915
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
is it part, is it, was this lean one way or the other?

3916
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
I think you all see the real point I'm

3917
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
getting. I'm not saying make a copy of that, but I'm just

3918
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
saying that movie love

3919
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
it or hate it had a social impact

3920
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
and I want to see something that

3921
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
powerful about how we're treating people

3922
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
that work in the game industry. Does that make sense?

3923
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Anyway,

3924
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
um, number two, the PlayStation classic

3925
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
in Rama's email. I too

3926
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
had wondered why the PlayStation classic isn't coming

3927
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
with dual shot controllers. They're going with the

3928
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
generation of games that didn't need them. From

3929
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
the reactions I saw, it seems that a lot of people

3930
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
forgot that the PlayStation originally had

3931
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
standard controllers. I also understand

3932
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
why people were taken aback at the price tag of

3933
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
$99. 20 games,

3934
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
each disk about 650 megabytes.

3935
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
All of the games are going to need at least

3936
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
13 gigs of space at minimum,

3937
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
at least 32 gigs tops.

3938
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Even at that price, I don't see

3939
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
myself investing in one.

3940
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
PlayStation emulation

3941
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
seems to be pretty well,

3942
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
so I should be able to play them on my laptop or

3943
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Surface 3 with minimal issues.

3944
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
Also, if you notice, the controller ports aren't

3945
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
even USB. To be quite

3946
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
honest, I feel that Atari has the

3947
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
right idea with their retro console.

3948
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
USB, you can make your own games,

3949
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
add your own extra storage.

3950
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
To be quite honest, I'm seriously considering

3951
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
to build my own mini retro box.

3952
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
We'll see.

3953
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
So, there you go. Uh, lastly,

3954
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
oh, I'm sorry, no, there's a few more here. Skype

3955
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
versus Discord. Uh, because I've said

3956
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
on the show,

3957
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
openly, I'm considering switching to Discord.

3958
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Uh, honestly, stay with Skype.

3959
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
A few episodes back, we tried

3960
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
to do our show on Discord because of Skype 7

3961
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
being discontinued, and Skype 8

3962
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
was buggy as fuck. Honestly, it did not

3963
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
work. There were too many audio dropout and

3964
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
lagging, so we switched back to Skype 8,

3965
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
and we haven't had any issues since.

3966
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
But what's interesting is that my other podcast I do

3967
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
over Discord is fine. I think because

3968
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
we're also streaming audio out, that could be the

3969
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
issue, and I look forward to hearing updates on

3970
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
the new studio streaming PC. Also,

3971
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
I've used my Surface 3 to record my

3972
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
podcast at conventions, so it's a great

3973
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
little device. I

3974
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
have considered the Surface as

3975
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
an option. It's a good choice.

3976
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
I've considered it. Is that what you use?

3977
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
No. No. You have a different thing.

3978
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Um, I just need to make sure it can do

3979
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Twitch and everything. I have a Surface

3980
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
3 Pro. I might want to bring it over.

3981
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
I might want to check it out a little. If you don't mind me poking

3982
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
at it a little bit. You can get them cheap.

3983
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Mine was only, like, 400

3984
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
used, and it came with everything.

3985
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Anyway, anyway, I'll get in that later.

3986
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Anyway, for what you want to do, I highly

3987
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
recommend a Surface Pro 5 or 6.

3988
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
We can talk offline for more details on that.

3989
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Might as well just get a laptop for that price.

3990
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
And then lastly, you know

3991
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Rama's got something to say about Bowsette.

3992
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
I know you're

3993
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
tired of the meme, and I know this has crossed

3994
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
deep into your neck of the woods. For what it's

3995
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
worth, it's gone deep into the anime

3996
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
and cosplay fandom. I'm seeing

3997
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
some great cosplays from this, with cosplayers

3998
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
doing many variants, and I love it.

3999
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
I know I busted your chops about it,

4000
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
but it's all fun and games. Just

4001
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
let us, the anime fans, enjoy

4002
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
this. Here's the thing.

4003
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
I'm not going to tell anyone what they can or can't

4004
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
do for fun, as long as they're not hurting anybody.

4005
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
I might argue that this

4006
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
is hurting my eyes.

4007
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
But jokes aside,

4008
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
y'all can have your fun, but I

4009
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
am going to sit there in my rocking chair,

4010
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
and the minute someone in a Bowsette cosplay

4011
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
comes up, I'm going to say, get the hell

4012
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
off my lawn.

4013
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Give me that, alright?

4014
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
Love and hearts

4015
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
and XOs, I mean it. Alright, anyway,

4016
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
back to the email. That's all that's been

4017
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
on my mind. Enjoying the show. Thankful for

4018
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
the podcast. Keep it fabulous.

4019
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
From the East Coast, the York of New

4020
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
Rama. There you go. Thank you

4021
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
for the emails. Great email.

4022
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Alright, going to

4023
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
another email from YYR,

4024
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
who says, hello LR.

4025
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Don't worry, I don't have a laundry list

4026
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
of complaints this week, but I did have

4027
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
a question for Loki.

4028
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
This is for you, sir. I'm listening.

4029
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Week after week, you mentioned that you've

4030
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
been playing on your DDR Extreme cabinet,

4031
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
but as a long time DDR player,

4032
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
I'm personally interested in hearing

4033
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
about your progression. What level

4034
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
are you up to now? What songs have

4035
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
you been working on lately? Now that you're

4036
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
playing constantly, at what rate

4037
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
have you been improving? Are you playing

4038
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
double, or just focusing on singles

4039
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
for now? You know, here's the funny part,

4040
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
is I'm not improving.

4041
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
That's the weirdest thing. I

4042
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
always play doubles, unless

4043
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
my, you know, kids

4044
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
or something want me to play singles, and actually

4045
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
it's weird. Playing doubles,

4046
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
like, I could be used to that,

4047
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
and I can play it for a while, and then I go and play

4048
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
singles, and it actually really hurts my feet

4049
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
to play singles. Like, it's just different.

4050
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
I don't know. It's...

4051
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
But, no, and sadly, I'm not really getting

4052
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
much better at

4053
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
it. I have been noticing

4054
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
lately, though, that the machine needs to be tuned up

4055
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
again, because I'm starting

4056
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
to get some misses on my upper arrow on the

4057
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
left side, but that's probably because

4058
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
it just needs to be cleaned out again. I never did clean

4059
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
the right side of the stage, either,

4060
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
so I probably should do that at some point,

4061
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
but, yeah, sadly,

4062
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
I haven't really been progressing too much further.

4063
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
I've tried to play harder songs.

4064
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
I guess that's not necessarily

4065
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
true, because when I started playing, I couldn't really play a whole

4066
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
lot of hard stuff.

4067
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
I've been kind of hanging around,

4068
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
like, I

4069
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
always do, like, the random Caprice stuff,

4070
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
because it's just, you know,

4071
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
random songs, and they usually would just play them on the

4072
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
standard difficulty, but then I've been

4073
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
lately been mixing it up when, you know,

4074
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
DDR tends to be nice,

4075
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
and throws in, you know,

4076
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
hey, let's do a Legend of Max, and then followed

4077
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
by, you know, Paranormal Survivor Max

4078
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
on a random Caprice. I'm like, fuck

4079
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
that, and I go and play something else.

4080
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
So, I've been trying to play, like,

4081
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
around, like, six to eight,

4082
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
but I find, like, the eight-footer song, especially in doubles,

4083
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
can get really tiring,

4084
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
and also the hard thing, too,

4085
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
is, like, after I come home and play DDR,

4086
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
it's after I've walked for, like, three to

4087
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
five miles that day already,

4088
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
and so I can tell when I'm getting tired

4089
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
because I start missing stuff more,

4090
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
so I don't really care about as far as, like,

4091
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
perfect attacking anything. If I pass the song, cool.

4092
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
That's it.

4093
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
But, yeah, I haven't really noticed that I'm, like,

4094
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
can, like, all of a sudden play Max or something

4095
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
now. I don't, I don't think I'm as

4096
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
good as I was before.

4097
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Do you notice your stamina improving at all, though, that, like,

4098
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
you know, that you were really winded in the

4099
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
beginning? Because I would think that if I were to get back into

4100
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
DDR every day, which I really, like, I just

4101
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
really wish I could. I wish I had a

4102
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
situation where I could have a DDR machine in this house.

4103
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
It's just not financially

4104
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
the thing to do, and we don't own this house,

4105
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
so it's just not, you know, something I really want to keep here.

4106
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
And even to go out and play at an

4107
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
arcade, like, A,

4108
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
it, I hate to say it, it's a little weird that I'm

4109
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
40 years old when we have these, you know,

4110
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
you know, younger kids that are playing the game. It's gonna look a little

4111
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
weird. Like, am I a predator? Honestly, no, because

4112
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
after, like, watching the people play

4113
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
Ace, they're, like, fucking hugging the bar

4114
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
on standard difficulty shit. I'm like,

4115
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
I'm not judging, but I'm

4116
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
judging. Well, that's a whole

4117
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
nother thing you're gonna get into. But anyway,

4118
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
my point is, really, though, all

4119
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
that aside, I mean, you guys could tell me it doesn't matter

4120
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
all you want, but the reality is, there just isn't

4121
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
a machine conveniently near here.

4122
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Yes, we have machines in Sacramento, but we

4123
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
have this thing called rush hour traffic,

4124
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
and it's gonna change your mind about a lot of things,

4125
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
too, about what's convenient to get to an amount

4126
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
of time. And just the area, town

4127
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
I live in, just, there's nothing convenient.

4128
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Like, sure, if there was, like, a DDR machine in

4129
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
an arcade, like, right up the street, I'd probably go there

4130
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
all the time. But anyway.

4131
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Alright, and then, I want to

4132
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
continue with YYR's email. I can't

4133
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
speak for everyone, but since a significant portion

4134
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
of OLR's audience came out of the DDR

4135
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
community, I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one

4136
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
interested in learning more about your progress.

4137
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
So I hope you'll give us regular updates as you

4138
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
pursue your personal goals.

4139
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Well, funny enough, I've been thinking, actually, the last

4140
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
few times I've been playing, of setting up a Twitch stream

4141
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
setup. I think you should.

4142
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
I've been looking into it, but, like, it's gonna

4143
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
be complicated to do something like that.

4144
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
Um, because I want to do, like, a

4145
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
multi-camera setup type thing, but...

4146
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Well, here's my suggestion.

4147
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Start basic. Like, I know

4148
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
you want to reach for the stars, and you know you want it

4149
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
to be fucking primo on day one, but I'm

4150
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
gonna also keep it real. OLR's

4151
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
gonna convert to Twitch soon. Don't expect

4152
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
it to be what we really want it to be

4153
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
day one. Day one is going to be camera

4154
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
pointed at us as we do this show,

4155
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
like it used to be on Justin TV

4156
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
all those years ago. Then, we might

4157
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
start to grow more and more, but again,

4158
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
I want to make, and I'm stressing this,

4159
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
especially for my podcast people out there, because I know

4160
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
there's a lot of you. I don't want to change

4161
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
it into a video show for those of you that

4162
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
are listening on audio. It's still Orange Lounge Radio,

4163
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
it's just that you can watch

4164
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
us do it on Twitch if you want, but, you know,

4165
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
that's all gonna grow with time, and so forth.

4166
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
So anyway, my point is, that's

4167
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
great you want a multi-camera setup. You don't need

4168
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
it day one. Right, I know that.

4169
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
And it's just, um,

4170
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
and not necessarily

4171
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
multi-camera, like, I would just want, like,

4172
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
you know, a camera and a

4173
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
screen capture type thing, you know,

4174
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
just so you can see that, but, like,

4175
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
I don't know who would want to watch, like, me,

4176
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
like, you're fucking tired,

4177
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
you know, oh shit, look

4178
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
at me, I barely passed the seven-footer,

4179
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
ooh, you know, it's like,

4180
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
yeah, but, you know,

4181
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
I'm fucking tired, because I've been

4182
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
exercising all day. Okay.

4183
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
So, here's the thing,

4184
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
here's the thing.

4185
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
I streamed Forza Horizon 4 this week.

4186
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Number one, I'm terrible at Forza Horizon 2.

4187
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Forza Horizon. Number two,

4188
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
I still love it. Number three,

4189
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Travis Donovan decided to crash my game,

4190
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
because that's what Travis Donovan does, and as

4191
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
I was driving off a cliff, he fucking pushed

4192
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
me off of it, live on stream, he drove

4193
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
his car into mine and pushed me off the cliff.

4194
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Now, as much as, so, it was

4195
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
honestly, it was terrible. We weren't progressing in the

4196
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
game at all, it was just, but,

4197
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
damn it, Loki, it was the funniest

4198
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
fucking thing. Like, even I had to look

4199
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
at it and go, okay, this is funny, because, like, I can't

4200
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
get up the hill, and then Travis comes and pushes me off the

4201
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
fucking cliff, and it's funny.

4202
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
So, you know what, you don't always have to be good at the games.

4203
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
So, so, honestly,

4204
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Loki, just title your stream

4205
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
Old Dude Getting Back into

4206
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
DDR, and, like, people aren't gonna give

4207
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
a fuck. Well, it's like, was it the one dude that, I don't even

4208
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
remember the guy's name, but, like, he was in the Kotaku

4209
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
article just this week, or something, about,

4210
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
like, how he lost 125 pounds

4211
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
playing DDR. It's, like, pretty much

4212
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
just what I'm doing, except he's been

4213
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
doing it slightly longer, like, he bought a

4214
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
DDR machine, he's losing weight,

4215
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
he's also eating dieting, he's lost

4216
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
weight, and it's like, god damn it,

4217
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
that's just the shit I'm doing, you know, so.

4218
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Document it all.

4219
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
And then, make a YouTube channel, and

4220
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
now you have a sponsor, and so on and

4221
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
so forth, you never know. Let's not get crazy.

4222
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Alright, um, S2100Matt also

4223
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
points out, you're doing something that he doesn't

4224
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
see on Twitch, you're playing doubles,

4225
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
most DDR people do singles.

4226
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
And most people perfect attack, and I

4227
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
am not gonna be perfect attacking on my machine.

4228
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
It's okay, you don't have to be the best.

4229
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Because that machine

4230
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
ain't capable of perfect attacking,

4231
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
I think. This is going to sound

4232
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
shady, but I know he would

4233
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
support me 100% in this statement,

4234
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
so hopefully he's out there listening still.

4235
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
If Bobby Blackwolf can stream,

4236
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
you can stream.

4237
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
I'll consider it.

4238
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
I would not have said that in a bitchy

4239
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
way if I know he didn't 100% support me.

4240
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
I have been thinking about it, and I've been like

4241
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
looking at my garage, and like, how would I set this

4242
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
up? I need to replace some lights and stuff

4243
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
because it's really dark, but

4244
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
I have been considering it. I may do it.

4245
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
And it would

4246
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
like, get me to

4247
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
play even more.

4248
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
But I mean, I just shit, like, fucking

4249
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
the other day I walked five

4250
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
miles, and then I come home and I play

4251
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
DDR for like, 30 minutes.

4252
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
And the problem is, like, you know, after you've walked that long,

4253
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
you know, during the day, it's like

4254
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
hard to play for an hour.

4255
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
So.

4256
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
You can get your kids involved, too. That could be fun, too.

4257
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
That could be fun.

4258
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Yeah, I guess, yeah.

4259
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
But there's also weirdness about putting your kids on video like that.

4260
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
They don't really know how to play.

4261
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
I mean, my one son's sorted.

4262
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
That's the entertaining part.

4263
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Beginner mode, but then they get bored with it

4264
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
pretty fast.

4265
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Alright. Anyway, and ActEftInChat

4266
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
says, I think Blackwolf acknowledges his lack

4267
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
of skills when playing most games. He probably doesn't

4268
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
mind as long as he's out of fun.

4269
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Exactly. I do need to get into it. I just need to

4270
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
buy all new gear because I don't have

4271
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
anything. Exactly. And that's why,

4272
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
and honestly, he's not as bad

4273
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
as games as he thinks he is. Especially when it comes to

4274
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
using games and stuff. Well, the other thing I've been looking to is, I've

4275
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
been seriously considering

4276
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
changing that over into a set medium machine

4277
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
because, um,

4278
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
I don't know. Because

4279
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
I'm just getting kind of

4280
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
bored with this all of a sudden.

4281
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Hold on. I just realized something because

4282
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
what I really think you need to do

4283
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
is you need to talk to

4284
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
NameRedacted, but I'm gonna show

4285
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
you this text message here. You need

4286
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
to talk to NameRedacted

4287
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
about

4288
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
this on your machine.

4289
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
And I bet that's something

4290
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
you could do. Oh, I already know how to do that.

4291
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
Oh, okay. Yeah, that I can do.

4292
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
I just have to buy a new drive for that.

4293
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Alright. Yeah, and that's, and I

4294
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
have, I already have that image to burn

4295
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
that, but it's just, and I

4296
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
thought about doing that. Alright.

4297
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
But maybe, I don't know. Anyhow,

4298
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
YYR concludes, that's it for me this time.

4299
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Not every email I write has to be a novel.

4300
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Well, every discussion

4301
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
has to be, apparently, though. We spent like

4302
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
five minutes on the email. That's alright, no.

4303
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Just almost every email.

4304
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Enjoy your week and happy gaming.

4305
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
Love, YYR. I inserted the

4306
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
love in there, but, you know, he'd probably

4307
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
be okay with that.

4308
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Alright, let's move on. We got some

4309
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
more news to get into, and then we're gonna

4310
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
get to your calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one

4311
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
word on Skype. Loki.

4312
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Alright. Um, so this is

4313
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
kind of interesting that

4314
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
it's a thing, but

4315
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
um, I'm glad it's a thing, actually.

4316
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
So, what's happening, Seattle Police

4317
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
are launching a new anti-swatting

4318
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
program, because, you know, swatting

4319
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
is fucking terrible, and

4320
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
people have been killed because of it,

4321
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
and it's, it's really not

4322
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
a great thing. So what they've done now

4323
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
is they have this registry that you can basically go

4324
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
and sign up on

4325
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
it, and letting them know that you have

4326
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
swatting concerns. Um,

4327
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
then that way that they will get that

4328
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
when there is

4329
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
you know, a call into

4330
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
the swat or whatever, saying, oh yeah,

4331
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
this person's got a thing, that message

4332
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
will pop up, and they're like, oh, okay,

4333
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
well maybe this is, you know, a

4334
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
streamer or something, and they'll proceed with, you

4335
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
know, a little bit differently than they would if

4336
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
they didn't have that sort of message.

4337
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
So, you know,

4338
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
what they need to do, I guess,

4339
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
if you're in the Seattle area, there's a website

4340
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
you can go to to actually do

4341
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
that. They have an official swatting

4342
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
resource site, and

4343
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
you create your

4344
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
profile, and then flag yourself as having

4345
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
swatting concerns, and then what'll happen

4346
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
is they say a 911 call taker

4347
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
receives a report of a critical

4348
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
incident, while ensuring

4349
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
the first responders are dispatched to

4350
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
that call for service as quickly as possible,

4351
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
the caller, uh, call taker will

4352
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
simultaneously check for whether

4353
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
or not swatting concerns have been registered

4354
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
at that address. If swatting concerns

4355
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
have been registered, this information can be

4356
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
shared with the responding officers, who will

4357
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
still proceed to the call.

4358
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
So that at least gives them kind of, like,

4359
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
you know,

4360
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
this is the situation I may be walking into.

4361
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
It's, um, it's

4362
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
an interesting solution. I'm not sure

4363
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
it's a perfect solution, but

4364
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
I mean, better than no solution. Exactly.

4365
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Like, at least we're trying

4366
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
something to fix this problem,

4367
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
so I'm like, alright, let's see, it's one

4368
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
city, let's see how it goes, because if

4369
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
it ends up doing well, maybe, and you know,

4370
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Seattle is a pretty big tech town,

4371
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
home of Amazon, home of Microsoft,

4372
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Nintendo, right, they're all in Seattle

4373
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
area, so, you know, if this does well there,

4374
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
you know, maybe other, uh,

4375
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
cities will take notice, and maybe this can be something

4376
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
that helps, um, you know, because we know

4377
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
somebody got fucking shot, that

4378
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
shouldn't have been shot. Yeah, they're completely

4379
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
wrong housekeeping, so, yeah.

4380
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Yeah, uh, Pooba, that wouldn't have, this

4381
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
wouldn't have prevented that, unfortunately, because

4382
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
No, but, at least

4383
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
again, it's something, we're trying to move somewhere.

4384
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Uh, Pooba in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

4385
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
says, damn, why don't we think of this sooner, smart

4386
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
on the PD for this. Yeah.

4387
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
It's about time, right? Yeah.

4388
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Alright, um,

4389
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
moving on, let's talk about Amazon, actually,

4390
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
because Amazon is having to put up

4391
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
with a, uh, leaked, uh, YouTube,

4392
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
or, excuse me, not YouTube, actually, it's very much

4393
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
not YouTube, but a leaked video that went up

4394
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
of their new MMO. It was

4395
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
2 hours and 11 minutes

4396
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
of streamed footage of their project

4397
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
called New World.

4398
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Now, we know New World exists,

4399
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
they've talked about this project before,

4400
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
but what's interesting about it is that, uh,

4401
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
it was, uh, originally put out

4402
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
there as a Google Drive file.

4403
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
The video then went to Pornhub

4404
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
as backup in case

4405
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
of removal, because you know how, like,

4406
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
interesting things end up on Pornhub

4407
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
sometimes, right? Like,

4408
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
not just the obvious,

4409
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
but you know how sometimes people will

4410
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
put, like, legit video on there,

4411
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
and some have even joked that,

4412
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
like, the company that could take on

4413
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
YouTube is Pornhub. 100%.

4414
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
I wholeheartedly agree,

4415
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
because they own, like, a lot of the

4416
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
streaming services, like the different

4417
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
porn streaming services,

4418
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
so they, they own

4419
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
a lot of them, and, I mean, all they have to do

4420
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
is put out one that's not a porn service

4421
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
and, boom, they've got the infrastructure

4422
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
for it. Yeah.

4423
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
Anyhow, the footage did get taken down

4424
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
from Pornhub, aw, but, uh,

4425
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
3800 people viewed it, and

4426
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
you know, of course, now

4427
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
it's spreading throughout the internet. Now it is on YouTube,

4428
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
and, or, excuse me, there's, like,

4429
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
an edited version on YouTube. Some

4430
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
YouTube users took the footage and kind of, like,

4431
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
compressed it down to, like, 11 minutes,

4432
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
and have done their own, uh, thing.

4433
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
So, anyway, what we learned about New World from the leak,

4434
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
it's a third-person survival MMO.

4435
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
There's resource gathering, crafting, action,

4436
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
combat. Uh, the concept behind

4437
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
it is that you are settling a new world, and you

4438
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
join forces with other players, uh,

4439
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
to form companies. You could be mercs,

4440
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
prospectors, craft people, architects.

4441
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
You claim territory and fight against

4442
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
raiders. So, it's kind of like

4443
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
a civilization-esque type of game,

4444
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
but mixed with, like, I don't know,

4445
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
DayZ or something?

4446
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
I don't know, like, a survival type of thing.

4447
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Anyway, um, Rust.

4448
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Also, what should be noted,

4449
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
speaking of PornHub and the fact that

4450
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
interesting videos go up there, in 2015,

4451
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
there was leaked Fallout 4

4452
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
footage that made there.

4453
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Um, because, I guess, it, uh,

4454
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
it takes a little longer for copyright

4455
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
strikes to hit on PornHub.

4456
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
They're a little slower to act, because they don't usually

4457
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
get this type of stuff, whereas, like, YouTube, you know,

4458
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
tends to put stuff down,

4459
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
even if they maybe don't necessarily need to.

4460
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
So, anyway,

4461
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
kind of interesting. I don't know if we, I don't think

4462
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
we have a date for New World. I think it's something that's

4463
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
still being worked on. Um, it is

4464
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
being made, um,

4465
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
um, who is making this game?

4466
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
I thought that Amazon had

4467
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
a studio, but all I see is Amazon's

4468
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
game. Anyway,

4469
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
alright, well, let's

4470
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
move on. Loki, uh, let's talk

4471
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
about the next story. Yes, so, the Switch,

4472
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
of course, you know, has been hacked, and

4473
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
with that, RetroArch

4474
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
has been added

4475
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
to the system, so, they've got,

4476
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
um, development now of it, I

4477
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
guess, has been going on

4478
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
for a while. Now, they have the

4479
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
latest version that runs on the Switch,

4480
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
and, of course, for those not familiar, RetroArch

4481
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
is a multi-system

4482
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
emulator, and

4483
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
so, you can do all sorts of things, like, they have

4484
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
the PSP, you know,

4485
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
you can do, um, Super

4486
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Nintendo, Nintendo. In fact, actually, I run

4487
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
RetroArch, um, my, um,

4488
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
SNES Mini.

4489
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
So, but,

4490
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
it's interesting to see, though, that they have

4491
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
all sorts of things running on there. Legend of Zelda,

4492
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
Okuri, and Tine, they have the screenshot of that.

4493
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
Um,

4494
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
Ridge Racer, they're saying, you know, you can

4495
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
even do split-screen Ridge Racer

4496
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
on that, each person has a controller.

4497
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Um,

4498
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
lots of cool stuff, but,

4499
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
I don't know. I mean,

4500
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
I'm not surprised that they have emulators

4501
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
running on a system.

4502
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
I mean, it's capable of it, which is, you know,

4503
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
makes sense.

4504
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
The real question is how long before Nintendo

4505
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
shuts it down, but I guess they can't, right?

4506
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
It's like a permanent, which might

4507
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
also be the reason why they're putting out a new thing in 2019.

4508
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Exactly. Yeah.

4509
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Um, here's another reason that they might want to do that

4510
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
as well, because not only are you going to be

4511
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
able to run your emulators,

4512
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
but you can also run mods in

4513
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Skyrim. That's right.

4514
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
So, they have a tool called the Skyrim

4515
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
NX Toolkit that allows people

4516
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
to port over mods that were made

4517
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
for other versions of the game

4518
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
for the Switch now.

4519
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
And, of course, the more popular mods

4520
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
that are working with that,

4521
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
are body mods!

4522
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
So, the big-breasted naked chicks.

4523
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
Hooray.

4524
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Going into Skyrim,

4525
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
because that's...

4526
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
Everybody wants sexy Skyrim.

4527
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
Well, not everybody.

4528
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Oh, sexy Skyrim! Okay, yes.

4529
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Well, they also said,

4530
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
the sexy mods have triple or more

4531
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
downloads than everything else.

4532
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
The other thing that they have is the intro skip mod

4533
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
that they uploaded about 37 times.

4534
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Oh, a practical, useful thing.

4535
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Yeah. But nobody cares.

4536
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
Sexy armor, and

4537
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
all sorts of other skeleton mods.

4538
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
And speaking of Skyrim,

4539
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
and then previously Pornhub, I'm surprised

4540
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
the amount of Skyrim porn that exists

4541
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
out there. I did not know that was a thing.

4542
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
There's a lot of, like, everything

4543
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
porn out there. Like, there's, like, Zelda

4544
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
Breath of the Wild porn. There's, like, you...

4545
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
I mean, again, you think... No, but I can, like,

4546
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
made in the Skyrim engine.

4547
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Oh, that they actually made it in... I think I've seen

4548
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
Skyrim. Like, they made porn.

4549
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
They do a lot, yeah.

4550
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
In the engine, that doesn't really

4551
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
lend itself well to the engine,

4552
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
but they do have mods with sex

4553
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
in them, and then they also have,

4554
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
I'm sure,

4555
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
I don't know, a lot of people use, actually, funny enough,

4556
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Source Filmmaker for

4557
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
porn stuff.

4558
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
Like, they'll use that to make stuff.

4559
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
You know what? As soon as Super Smash Brothers

4560
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
Ultimate comes out, within, like, two days, we're gonna have

4561
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
Super Gangbang Ultimate. Like, it's just

4562
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
a matter of time. Just wait for it.

4563
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
And then, within three days,

4564
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Bowsette will be there, even though she's not in the game.

4565
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Yeah. Speaking of which, I saw there was a version

4566
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
of Mario 64 that someone

4567
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
modded Bowsette into, and you can play as her.

4568
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
Granted, she looks

4569
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
a little bit more, um, Bowser

4570
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
than Bowsette, but, you know.

4571
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Moving on, let's talk about Castlevania.

4572
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Uh, there's a new Castlevania

4573
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
portal. That's right, Konami,

4574
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
not the portal game, sorry, meaning, like, a web

4575
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
portal. Konami did launch a

4576
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
Castlevania, like, website, basically.

4577
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Um, because if you go to this Castlevania

4578
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
portal, you get to see a whole, like, timeline

4579
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
of the series.

4580
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
Uh, there's a big gap between 2014

4581
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
and 2018, which is, you know, sad,

4582
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
but that's the way it is. Uh, we do see

4583
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
the rebirth of

4584
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
Castlevania with the new, uh, you know,

4585
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
Requiem that's coming out on PlayStation 4.

4586
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
Um, but anyhow,

4587
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
thanks to the new Castlevania series

4588
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
on Netflix, thanks to Simon being

4589
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, uh,

4590
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
more people are getting, you know, re-interested

4591
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
in Castlevania, I think. So,

4592
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
Konami's created this website to, kind of, educate

4593
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
people a little bit on Castlevania,

4594
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
but there is a section called

4595
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
New Product.

4596
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
Hmm. Oh, boy. I, I,

4597
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
I can't wait for the new Batista

4598
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
lot machine. Oh, God.

4599
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Of course, of course. So, uh,

4600
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
who knows, maybe there'll be a Castlevania

4601
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
new game in the works,

4602
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
and hopefully it's as good as,

4603
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
like, maybe when they redid Bomberman,

4604
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
because I know when we think of Konami

4605
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
lately, we don't have a lot of positive feelings,

4606
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
but, to be fair, the Bomberman

4607
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
game was a'ight, so

4608
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
we'll see if the Castlevania thing

4609
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
is good, too, hopefully.

4610
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
That's more Hudson, though, but, you know.

4611
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
Yeah, well, maybe, maybe they contracted with another

4612
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
studio to do it. Who knows? We'll see,

4613
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
I guess. Well, Castlevania

4614
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
Requiem is not going to use the

4615
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
original localization for

4616
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
Symphony of the Night, so be warned.

4617
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
If you were looking forward to some of the

4618
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
infamous voice acting, it's not

4619
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
quite the same, because, uh,

4620
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
the PSP, uh,

4621
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
English version is the one that's going to be

4622
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
in there again. So, if you were waiting

4623
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
for the What is a Man? Nope.

4624
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
You're gonna get the redone voice lines

4625
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
from PSP's Dracula X Chronicles.

4626
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
That is also the

4627
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
same for Rondo of

4628
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Blood. So,

4629
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
um, well, that's too bad.

4630
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
But, um, not surprising either,

4631
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
especially after the Silent Hill remake, so

4632
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
there's clearly something going on with the voice actor

4633
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
rules and all that stuff, so.

4634
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Alright, a few more stories for you guys, then we're gonna

4635
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
get to the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,

4636
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
all one word on Skype. But first, Loki.

4637
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Yes, but first we have to talk about the

4638
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
final conclusion of what,

4639
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
you know, fighting games are going

4640
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
towards. So, you may notice

4641
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
that with each fighting game that comes out,

4642
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
we're pushing the boundaries of

4643
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
outfits and

4644
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
what scantily clad,

4645
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
you know, outfits

4646
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
the characters have and the boob

4647
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
physics and stuff like that.

4648
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
Well, it's only a matter of

4649
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
time, and the time is now,

4650
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
that a game should

4651
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
exist called Naked Fighter 3D.

4652
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
And it is a one-man project.

4653
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
A one-man indie project, you may

4654
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
will. It's a turn-based

4655
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
fighting game where you

4656
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
fight naked people

4657
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
against naked people.

4658
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
That's right. You can

4659
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
fight women against men, against

4660
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
transsexuals, whatever you

4661
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
want. With a custom

4662
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
character creator,

4663
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
I don't know. It's a unity

4664
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
thing, I guess, now, but

4665
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
if you want to check it out, they've got a demo.

4666
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
And they have, like, skill trees

4667
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
and stuff, and there's- Boy, I can't wait.

4668
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
It's just-

4669
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
Is there a dong slider? There is a

4670
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
dong slider for both male and female.

4671
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Okay.

4672
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
I'm just gonna let the internet

4673
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
have its thing. It can just, the internet

4674
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
just, it can exist.

4675
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Well, they'll make, inevitably,

4676
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Naked Bowsette.

4677
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
I'm curious, like, how a turn-based

4678
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
fighting game works, though. Like, how's

4679
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
that, you mean?

4680
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
I'd be curious to see how that plays.

4681
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
But this is weird.

4682
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
I guess it's like a Final Fantasy type,

4683
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
you know, fight, select

4684
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
option, slap,

4685
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
kick. But if you're

4686
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
interested, they have a Patreon.

4687
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
So Patreon.com slash Naked Fighter

4688
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
3D. For more information,

4689
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
you can go download that demo, and

4690
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
go check it out.

4691
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
Bobby Blackwolf asked, why didn't you download the demo,

4692
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Logie? Um, I did.

4693
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
I haven't played it, though. Hey,

4694
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
I got to. I gotta try it.

4695
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
For research purposes only.

4696
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
Gotta see what it is.

4697
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
I'm curious, like, how a turn-based fighting,

4698
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
like, how- I mean, I'm curious, too.

4699
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
How do you make a turn-based fighting game?

4700
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
We're all a little curious.

4701
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
I mean,

4702
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
I've already seen the videos. The videos are

4703
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
goddamn ridiculous, you know, with the sliders

4704
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
and everything, but, um,

4705
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
yeah.

4706
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
It's a thing.

4707
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Alright, uh,

4708
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
anyhow, one more story for you guys before we

4709
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
open up the Skype line, and this has to do with

4710
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
Steam, uh, and the removal

4711
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
of minigames. Speaking of, like, porny games,

4712
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
Steam has recently removed

4713
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
179 games,

4714
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
uh, and this is probably from

4715
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
the whole, like, if you're trying to troll purposely,

4716
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
it's nice to see they've finally

4717
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
maybe gone back a little bit on the whole, like,

4718
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
well, things on Steam should offend you

4719
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
and that whole bullshit thing that they were-

4720
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
their line was recently.

4721
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
But anyhow, uh, apparently,

4722
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
about 179 games have been removed in the past

4723
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
few weeks, including such titles

4724
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
as Make Border Great Again,

4725
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
Big Dick,

4726
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
Milf, Hentai Sisters,

4727
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Putin, Boobs,

4728
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
and Trump. I mean, I was looking forward to

4729
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
that one myself. Uh,

4730
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
Logan versus KSI,

4731
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
which is, I don't know what that means,

4732
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
and my life is probably better for it.

4733
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
Um, Logan Paul and KSI, they

4734
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
did a boxing match. No, okay, I got it.

4735
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
They're two YouTubers.

4736
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
Uh, 31 different games that have some

4737
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
variation on the title Achievement Hunter.

4738
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
So, anyhow, now we have an

4739
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
idea what Steam means when they

4740
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
say trolling,

4741
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
basically. So, I guess

4742
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
that's nice. Anyway,

4743
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
ugh.

4744
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
Yep, Steam is kind of a garbage

4745
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
dump, uh, of games sometimes,

4746
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
and, uh, yeah, I-

4747
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
I think they might need to curate their

4748
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
stuff a little better, but at least they're making some

4749
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
attempts at it by, uh, scraping a lot of this

4750
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
bottom-of-the-barrel stuff out of the store.

4751
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
So, there you go.

4752
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
Siya Tabiri in our chat suggests,

4753
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Professor Layaton and the Mystery

4754
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
Box. No, that's-

4755
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
I might actually play that.

4756
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
That sounds like a porny title, like, you know how, like,

4757
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
they might do, like, a porn

4758
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
take on a big, like,

4759
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
like, Lord of the Cockring or something, like,

4760
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
it would be- Saving Ryan's Privates.

4761
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
Yeah, Shaving Ryan's Privates, yeah.

4762
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
Yeah, exactly. Anyway,

4763
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
let's get to the

4764
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,

4765
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
all one word on

4766
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
Skype. Um,

4767
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
I'm trying to think, um, cause you know I run-

4768
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
and the Skype line is open.

4769
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
Uh, since we're talking about funny porn titles,

4770
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
you know, I run with the Rocky Horror Crowd

4771
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
and they know some weird shit, so I think the funniest

4772
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
porn thing I ever saw was

4773
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
Beaver and Buttface,

4774
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
which was Beavis and Butthead, and I

4775
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
swear to God, one of the actors goes,

4776
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
huh, huh, I think I'm gonna cum or something.

4777
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
It was ridiculous.

4778
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
Anyway, Skype line is lit up,

4779
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
let's get to it. Uh, and then

4780
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
wow, those calls I was trying to take

4781
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
just straight up disappeared.

4782
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
So,

4783
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
so, the chatters are yelling at

4784
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
me, Poopa says, Rob, no, I'm

4785
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
sorry, but if I had to see this

4786
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
and had it seared into my brain for all eternity,

4787
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
guess what, so do you.

4788
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
And Dartasuya says, I'm pretty

4789
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
sure Bowsette already has a porn

4790
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
parody. She does. Yes, unfortunately,

4791
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
that crossed my desk this week

4792
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
and went

4793
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
immediately into the trash

4794
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
receptacle. Alright,

4795
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
I'm trying to get some calls, dang it, Skype

4796
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
cooperate, here we go. Hi, you're on Orange

4797
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
Lounge Radio, who's this?

4798
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio,

4799
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
who's this?

4800
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
Perhaps we have a connection

4801
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
on Orange Lounge Radio. Oh, sorry, I don't know

4802
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
why my headset was muted, but it

4803
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
was. That's alright. Hi, who's this?

4804
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
This is Eric RPG. Hey, Eric RPG,

4805
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

4806
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
Um, just wanna talk about, uh,

4807
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
two open world games I've been playing and

4808
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
they're polar opposites of each other.

4809
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
Okay, what's the first one? The first one's

4810
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

4811
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
Oh, yeah, I was curious about

4812
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
this game, but I was- I hate

4813
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
this thing. Really, because

4814
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
I, it looked really interesting, but

4815
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
I was really turned off

4816
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
when I heard that they were selling in the

4817
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
store this $10 thing for double

4818
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
XP and just, and that, like,

4819
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
double XP was kinda like what you needed

4820
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
to really progress through the game.

4821
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
There's a part of me that's like, just

4822
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
tack $10 on to the

4823
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
price of your game, stop being a coward,

4824
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
this is what you wanna do,

4825
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
just do it. Like, charge what

4826
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
you're really trying to charge for the game and stop

4827
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
all this other bullshit. But anyway, what are

4828
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
your thoughts? The experience that you get for doing quests

4829
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
is not as much as

4830
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
you could get in Origins, and even

4831
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
Origins kinda felt grindy,

4832
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
but, like, it wasn't nearly as

4833
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
bad as this game. That's unfortunate.

4834
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
Because I didn't mind doing the quests then.

4835
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
But, um, I don't have the kind of time

4836
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
the game demands for me, and it

4837
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
is sorta like, like, like a pay-to-win

4838
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
game where you, where they basically

4839
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
are cajoling you into paying

4840
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
for the experience booster.

4841
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
Which was, which

4842
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
is something that didn't exist in a previous game.

4843
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
But, um, that

4844
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
along with the fact that the game is very

4845
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
repetitious to begin with,

4846
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
like, sure, there are some unique

4847
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
quests that you can do that, like,

4848
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
give you decent rewards, but most of

4849
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
them are pretty much, go

4850
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
here and kill a lot of dudes.

4851
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
Or

4852
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
steal something, but you end up

4853
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
killing a lot of dudes anyways, because they're in your way.

4854
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
Well, that's unfortunate.

4855
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
I haven't heard quite as negative

4856
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
of a reception of the game as a whole,

4857
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
except for the microtransactions part,

4858
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
but I gotta admit that- That ruins it, though.

4859
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
Yeah, no, I hear ya.

4860
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
In the, everything else I just

4861
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
mentioned.

4862
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
It wouldn't feel so grindy if you

4863
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
just got double XP out the gate.

4864
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
And then there's

4865
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
a game like Spider-Man, which I also

4866
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
played. It's like, I ran in

4867
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
the other game from Redbox

4868
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
because no other Redbox had Spider-Man.

4869
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
It's like, I'll do this over the weekend, because

4870
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
I'm taking Monday off.

4871
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
And, um,

4872
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
I tried playing it for

4873
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
most of Saturday, and then I just returned

4874
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
it on Sunday against Spider-Man today.

4875
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
And how's Spider-Man?

4876
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
Spider-Man is everything

4877
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
that an open world game should be doing.

4878
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
I mean, it still

4879
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
has a lot of that, like, stupid

4880
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
fetch quest stuff that's more

4881
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
busywork and doesn't have any real

4882
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
significant story content.

4883
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
And there's a lot of collectible

4884
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
junk, but, um,

4885
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
it's a lot more fun game,

4886
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
tight controls, and,

4887
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
like, even on my

4888
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
base PS4, I mean, I did experience

4889
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
some issues, but I think that has more

4890
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
to do with the fact that I probably need to, like,

4891
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
defrag the hard drive.

4892
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
Because that happens after a while,

4893
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
after you've downloaded a lot.

4894
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
That's very true. It's something, uh, sometimes

4895
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
I even forget to do. But you can't defrag

4896
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
a solid state drive.

4897
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
Yeah, I'm just using

4898
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
a standard drive. Yeah, I hear you.

4899
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
But I probably should just

4900
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
get an external.

4901
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
So, you mentioned you rented

4902
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
Spider-Man. Do you think you're gonna end up

4903
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
purchasing it, because you like it so much?

4904
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
Um,

4905
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
I'm probably gonna beat it to completion,

4906
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
but I might just decide to

4907
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
not do that and return it tomorrow, because

4908
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
I can get it later, hopefully on a

4909
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
Black Friday sale.

4910
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
Because I'll probably be playing it even after I

4911
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
beat the main game. Yeah.

4912
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Alright, well, I'm very curious

4913
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
to check out Spider-Man as well, and I'm happy to

4914
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
hear you don't have the same microtransaction stuff, but

4915
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
I don't get quite as into the Marvel

4916
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
stuff as other people do, but,

4917
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
like, or DC, really,

4918
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
but I did, I mean, even, I say that,

4919
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
but I did buy, like, Arkham

4920
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
City or whatever, what was the one, the

4921
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
open, big open world one, and it was

4922
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
really good. Arkham

4923
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
Knight? Yeah, that might have been it. Um, and it was,

4924
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
it was good, so I hear a lot of

4925
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
the, it's basically that with Spider-Man,

4926
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
and I'm like, okay, I'm into it.

4927
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
Yeah, um,

4928
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
I didn't like Arkham Knight as much as

4929
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
Arkham Asylum or Arkham City,

4930
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
because, uh, they put it in the

4931
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
tank sections, and I was like, this is

4932
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
not a Batman game anymore, why is this here?

4933
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
Maybe it was Arkham Asylum,

4934
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
I thought that was the first game, but anyway,

4935
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
but yeah, that's, uh, that game

4936
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
was really good, and then I hear a lot about the Spider-Mans

4937
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
really good too, and I see all these screenshots

4938
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
that look great, like, the game just looks like it's really

4939
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
pretty, so.

4940
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
But other than that, I've been playing

4941
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
Mega Man 11, which I think is

4942
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
probably,

4943
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
I'm gonna put it above 9,

4944
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
just a little bit. Okay.

4945
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
As, like, one of my favorite Mega Man games,

4946
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
my favorite being the third,

4947
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
and then 9 being

4948
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
number 2, that would be,

4949
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
this would be a number 3.

4950
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
How many games are in this series?

4951
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
Um,

4952
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
11, plus the side games,

4953
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
like, uh, the spin-offs

4954
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
like, uh, X and

4955
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
all that stuff.

4956
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
But, um,

4957
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
so those are my top 3, and

4958
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
um, I do think

4959
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
that, uh, the game has

4960
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
a little bit of, uh,

4961
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
it's kind of, it's kind of like

4962
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
barebones, but, um,

4963
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
I guess that

4964
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
Capcom did essentially

4965
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
what they needed to do, and

4966
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
didn't try to overreach, just to

4967
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
prevent themselves from screwing it up too much.

4968
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
But I could

4969
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
yell at Capcom for also doing the same thing that

4970
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
Ubisoft did with

4971
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
Assassin's Creed Odyssey that they're going to be doing

4972
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
with Devil May Cry 5.

4973
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
Basically the same thing.

4974
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
Where they'll charge you money

4975
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
to pay for extra boost,

4976
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
experience boost, so you can get more red orbs.

4977
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
Yeah, I just wish, if game

4978
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
companies want to do this, they just

4979
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
make the game $70 already,

4980
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
and just give us the right proper

4981
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
balancing in the game, because this is

4982
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
just, it's just getting ridiculous.

4983
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
And it's just, it's, I realize

4984
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
games are expensive to develop, and they need to

4985
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
make their money back, but,

4986
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
like, you're shooting yourself in the foot

4987
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
by making the money back in this manner.

4988
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
Yeah.

4989
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
One thing I will comment on in regards to

4990
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
that, at least Capcom did well

4991
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
in terms of Mega Man, is that

4992
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
it is not priced as a full pop

4993
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
game, so even though, yes, it is simplistic

4994
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
in its offerings, it is

4995
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
not charged at, you know, a full

4996
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
$59.99, so I believe it was,

4997
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
I don't know what the Canadian, the Canadian

4998
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
or US price equivalent is,

4999
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
but it was a $39.99 in Canada,

5000
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
so I think it's probably $29.99 for you guys.

5001
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
Probably, yeah. So, there's that

5002
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
at least. Yeah, there is that.

5003
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
Alright. Well, Eric RPG,

5004
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
I'm going to let you go so I can get some more calls,

5005
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
but thank you for your thoughts.

5006
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
Yeah, and maybe you could tune

5007
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
into RP Grinders'

5008
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
podcast, where me and

5009
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
Breakman have been doing

5010
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
Mega Man Retrospective, but

5011
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
we'll have a final episode soon

5012
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
and we'll probably have our reviews

5013
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
of Mega Man 11 up then.

5014
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
Alright. And we tend to go

5015
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
live around Wednesdays

5016
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
at 7,

5017
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
no, 8,

5018
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
yeah, 8 PM Eastern.

5019
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
Alright.

5020
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
Check that out, RP Grinders. Alright.

5021
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
See you later. Take care. Bye.

5022
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word

5023
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
on Skype if you want to get in.

5024
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
You can try to get in right now.

5025
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Meanwhile, while we're

5026
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
waiting for, what?

5027
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
As fast as I talk, it lights right back up.

5028
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
Let's get to another call. Hi, OrangeLoungeRadio,

5029
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
who's this? Hey, what's going on, everyone?

5030
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
It's Rama. Hey, Rama. An email

5031
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
and a call tonight. Two for one

5032
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
special. Alright, what's up, buddy?

5033
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
Okay, in response to that

5034
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
naked fighting game, I just

5035
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
have one thing to say about that. What's that?

5036
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
Excuse me

5037
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
while I whip this out. Oh,

5038
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
please don't.

5039
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
No, thank you.

5040
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
Hard pass.

5041
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
They have groin kicks in the game.

5042
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
They have what? Groin kicks.

5043
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
Well, that seems appropriate. Oh, boy.

5044
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
Is that what you wanted to talk about, was

5045
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
naked fighting, Rama? No, I

5046
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
did that two weeks ago, but that's the story for another

5047
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
time, another show, and so on and so forth,

5048
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

5049
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
Oh, righty then.

5050
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
Oh, okay.

5051
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
You're the one that brought up Folsom

5052
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
Street fair. Hold on, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5053
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
Delvin, could you go get me the

5054
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,000
brain bleach? It's in the other room.

5055
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:32,000
Because

5056
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
my brain hurts right now.

5057
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,000
It was too much.

5058
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
It was just too much. No, I'm kidding. Alright,

5059
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
what's really up?

5060
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
I gotta throw my two cents in about this

5061
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
DDR movie. I mean,

5062
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
I'm picturing

5063
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
the final stage,

5064
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
the final part of the movie,

5065
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
since you brought up Scott Pilgrim. They're in his

5066
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
warehouse. The bad boss is on the

5067
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
left side. Our hero

5068
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
is in the

5069
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
bathroom, just getting

5070
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
motivated, and it's like that whole scene from

5071
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
8 Mile, and you see him come out in

5072
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
the hoodie, and they just do

5073
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
max 300,

5074
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
1.5, skip.

5075
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
That's not gonna

5076
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:14,000
make a fun movie.

5077
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:16,000
That's not gonna be a good

5078
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,000
movie. It might.

5079
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,000
I'm just, in reference to earlier

5080
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,000
chat, me and Bob Coffey were talking about, they have

5081
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:24,000
been animes with similar

5082
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
plotlines,

5083
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,000
and it worked. I mean,

5084
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
fuck, if you've

5085
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
played, um,

5086
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
Elite Beat Agents is basically the same thing.

5087
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
I just feel like the

5088
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
DDR movie is gonna be You've Got

5089
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:40,000
Served, too. I really just feel

5090
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,000
like that's what it's gonna be.

5091
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:44,000
I mean, well,

5092
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,000
if it's anything like La Machina de Baja,

5093
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,000
I will be in the front row watching it.

5094
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
I guess I need to give it a chance

5095
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
and see what they turn, but I just, you know, again,

5096
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
DDR doesn't have a

5097
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
story. Like, at least Monster

5098
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
Hunter and Mega Man kind of, like, have

5099
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
stories, but DDR just, like,

5100
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,000
doesn't have a story, and that's okay.

5101
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
It doesn't, like, it's

5102
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
a great game. It doesn't need

5103
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
a story. Well, there

5104
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
was a DDR manga that

5105
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
came out sometime back.

5106
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,000
It was not an official one.

5107
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
It was a fan. A friend of mine did

5108
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
call the 10K Millennium.

5109
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,000
It was, it was really cool. It was basically

5110
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
a DDR tournament. It was

5111
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
a cash cow.

5112
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
Hahahaha.

5113
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
But I tell you what,

5114
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
this current idea for a DDR

5115
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
film is a hell of a lot better than the

5116
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
supposed one that floated around back in

5117
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,000
2000. I never saw that one.

5118
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000
What was that supposed to be?

5119
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
Well, according

5120
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
to what was supposed to be with that

5121
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
script, it was about

5122
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,000
a boy teaching a girl

5123
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,000
English through DDR.

5124
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
Are we sure

5125
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,000
this wasn't, like, DDR Freak fanfic?

5126
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,000
No. Alright, are we

5127
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
sure? I'm positive.

5128
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
Alright, just making sure. Are we very sure? Hahahaha.

5129
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:00,000
I'm very, very sure. I remember

5130
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,000
if I could've sworn this was

5131
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000
discussed on a show back in

5132
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000
the day. No, it probably was

5133
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
and there's a really good reason I've forgotten

5134
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
over the years.

5135
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,000
What's funny is that

5136
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:14,000
I may not remember certain things

5137
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000
at work, but I sure as fuck remember shit like

5138
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,000
this. I know. I know.

5139
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:20,000
Whereas I can't remember what happened on this show

5140
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
last week, but that's why you guys are all great.

5141
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
Like, some of the, I swear to God, some of the,

5142
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
some days I feel like RuPaul around here.

5143
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
And I say that joke because, and Delvin understands

5144
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:30,000
this, and some of you out there too, if you ever

5145
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
listen to, like, RuPaul's podcast and stuff, like,

5146
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
you learn, like, just, like, he is

5147
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
such an old man.

5148
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
Like, he does not, like, he, like, seriously,

5149
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,000
Michelle's like, yeah, Carson's been playing Fortnite

5150
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,000
and Ru's like, what's a Fortnite?

5151
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
No, no, Rob, I

5152
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,000
can tell you exactly what happened on last

5153
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
week's show. You had a mimosa

5154
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,000
and you went total B-Arthur on everyone.

5155
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,000
I had a mimosa last week.

5156
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:54,000
I don't remember that.

5157
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,000
We do.

5158
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:58,000
No, seriously, I didn't have a mimosa.

5159
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:00,000
I'd remember that. Now,

5160
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,000
last night,

5161
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,000
well, I had a lot to drink.

5162
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:06,000
That's a different story.

5163
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
But we're not that, what had happened was,

5164
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
no, we're not gonna talk about it on this show.

5165
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
Alright.

5166
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
Anyway, I'm gonna let you go, my friend.

5167
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
But thank you for the call, except for that one

5168
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,000
part that I will have seared in my brain

5169
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:20,000
for all time. But,

5170
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,000
you brought it up, I'm sorry.

5171
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,000
Bye.

5172
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:26,000
Bye.

5173
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:28,000
Alright. That's gonna do it for the

5174
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,000
Skype line tonight. Thank you guys

5175
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:32,000
who were able to get through. If you didn't get through, though,

5176
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
please feel free to send us an email.

5177
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,000
Participate at OrangelaungeRadio.com

5178
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,000
is the place where you, too, can send an email

5179
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:40,000
and have it read on a future episode.

5180
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:42,000
But, for now, we're gonna

5181
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
proceed to wrap up the show.

5182
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,000
As I always say at the end of the show, if you

5183
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell

5184
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
a friend or five about the show. Help us spread

5185
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
the word, because we are the show where every gamer has

5186
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,000
a voice, but if the voices aren't here,

5187
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
then how can we air them?

5188
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
So, tell a friend or two.

5189
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
A nice five star review in a place like iTunes

5190
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000
goes an awful long way, and we

5191
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,000
excuse me, we would really appreciate

5192
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,000
those. Delvin,

5193
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,000
all the way from Toronto, Canada,

5194
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,000
thank you so much for being here tonight.

5195
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
Thank you for having me. I am so

5196
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,000
happy you finally got to actually be on

5197
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
the show. You came all the way to Sacramento,

5198
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:18,000
just to be on OLR.

5199
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:20,000
There wasn't, like, work involved in San

5200
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,000
Francisco or anything. You came all the way

5201
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,000
out here just to be on OLR.

5202
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,000
Oh, and just to see you and Alan, of course.

5203
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,000
No, I love it, I love it.

5204
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
Come back any time.

5205
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:32,000
It might be a while,

5206
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:34,000
but yeah. And hopefully when I come

5207
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,000
to Toronto, you can actually do

5208
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,000
an episode of Video Game Realness and I can be there.

5209
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:40,000
Oh yeah, absolutely. Okay, work. That sounds awesome.

5210
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,000
Anyway, give us the social media plugs one more

5211
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,000
time. Where can people follow you if they want to see more of

5212
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:46,000
Delvin and company?

5213
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,000
So you can see the pod, or listen

5214
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:50,000
to the podcast at videogamerealness.com

5215
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:52,000
You can follow us on Twitter

slash vgrealness.

5220
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:02,000
Please send all our best to your

5221
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:04,000
co-hosts over on Video Game Realness. I know there's

5222
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:06,000
really four of you there. It's not just you, but you know.

5223
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,000
Absolutely. I appreciate you representing

5224
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:10,000
the show tonight. I'm here.

5225
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:12,000
All right. Where are they

5226
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:14,000
though? Where is she though?

5227
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:16,000
Where is she though?

5228
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:18,000
All right. Oh, and we always ask

5229
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:20,000
at the end of the show, of course, if you have any final thoughts.

5230
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:22,000
So do you have any final thoughts you'd like to leave

5231
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,000
our listeners with tonight?

5232
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:26,000
Eh?

5233
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:28,000
Perfect.

5234
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:30,000
Thank you. Oh, I love

5235
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:32,000
that song. It's my favorite DDR song. Okay, anyway.

5236
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:34,000
Uh, Loki, how about you?

5237
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:36,000
Your final thought tonight?

5238
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:38,000
My final thought is we didn't do

5239
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:40,000
last minute stories, but I

5240
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:42,000
had one thing real quick I want to talk about.

5241
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:44,000
Okay, fair enough. Toys R Us.

5242
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:46,000
Should we talk about Toys

5243
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:48,000
R Us? I mean, we can,

5244
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:50,000
but I can't believe that they're

5245
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:52,000
now thinking about coming back?

5246
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:54,000
After they've fired all those people, sure.

5247
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:56,000
Well, technically, I think it's a company that's

5248
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,000
selling the brand as Toys R Us.

5249
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
So it's not really Toys R

5250
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
Us. It's somebody who cut up

5251
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:04,000
Toys R Us and is now wearing them as a dress.

5252
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:06,000
That's a Toys

5253
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:08,000
R Us skin suit.

5254
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,000
That is what is happening, yes.

5255
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:12,000
Okay. All right.

5256
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:14,000
My final thought is

5257
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:16,000
I'm still trying to work on

5258
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:18,000
game development stuff.

5259
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:20,000
This hasn't helped that I've been tired

5260
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:22,000
or had a headache for two days, you know.

5261
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:24,000
But I've been

5262
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:26,000
working. The thing, the problem I have is

5263
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:28,000
that I keep starting stuff and then

5264
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:30,000
running the roadblocks of what I can and

5265
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:32,000
cannot do by myself with my

5266
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:34,000
current knowledge, and so that's kind of

5267
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:36,000
why I keep jumping between projects, because

5268
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:38,000
it's just like, I get into this thing where I

5269
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:40,000
have to, like, research a bunch of stuff, and it's like,

5270
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:42,000
I want to make progress now, and I'm

5271
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:44,000
impatient with that.

5272
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:46,000
All right. Figure it out.

5273
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:48,000
My final thought is I need my

5274
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,000
Pokémon storage increased to 2,000.

5275
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:52,000
I need it. I need it. No,

5276
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:54,000
I don't have a problem keeping three of every

5277
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:56,000
type of Pokémon. You have a problem.

5278
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:58,000
I was just going to say, I was like, maybe you should keep

5279
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:00,000
three of every goddamn Pokémon.

5280
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:02,000
I don't have a problem. You have a problem.

5281
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:04,000
You have a problem. Good night, everybody.

5282
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:06,000

5283
