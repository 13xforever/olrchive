That's just one story of video gaming past. Stay tuned for plenty more, including the present and the future, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	46000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 749 for this October the 21st of 2018.
46000	52000	Joining you in studio, myself, Rob Roberts, and say hello to Loki with me, as always.
52000	53000	Hello.
53000	54000	Hi, how are you?
54000	55000	I'm here.
55000	64000	Yes, you're smelling up my whole house with garlic with your food choice tonight. No, but you went to a place that I recommended to you, so I'm psyched to have you try it, because some of the best-
64000	67000	Halal chicken, or fried chicken.
67000	73000	Yeah, halal fried chicken, and I went there for the first time with Alan like a week ago, and I was like, dang, that's some of the best. And they don't pay me to do these ads, by the way.
73000	84000	I know you listen to a lot of podcasts that start off with ads, they're gonna tell you about some boxed meal thing, or some bed. No, this is just legit, like, our lives, and you know what, sometimes I get really excited about food.
84000	88000	So, I felt the need to share, yeah, I thought this place was really good, so.
88000	89000	Yeah, it's pretty good.
89000	90000	Yeah.
90000	92000	Yeah, they just took a little bit of time getting stuff ready, but it's good.
92000	93000	It happens, it happens.
93000	94000	So I got chicken and waffles.
94000	95000	Uh-huh, as one does.
95000	98000	Well, now all I have is waffles, because chicken's gone.
98000	99000	Chicken's gone, but the chicken was good?
99000	100000	Chicken was pretty good, yeah.
100000	101000	Yeah, chicken was good.
101000	102000	Probably could have gotten more chicken.
102000	105000	Did you just get, like, strips, or did you get, like, the type you eat off the bone?
105000	107000	I got, like, chicken legs.
107000	108000	Okay, yeah.
108000	109000	Yeah, drumsticks.
109000	110000	I like chicken, I like the fried chicken, yeah, the drumsticks are good, yeah.
110000	115000	Yeah, so I could have gotten the strips, I guess, but I, this is really my only meal
115000	118000	today, so I was like, I can do whatever I want.
118000	122000	Izzy or this, I'm gonna drive to Quiznos, the only Quiznos that's still around my house.
122000	123000	I didn't know there was anywhere left.
123000	128000	Which is, like, all the way by the other freeway, and, like, it's, like, 20 minutes out of
128000	131000	the way, but I may go there next week.
131000	132000	Okay, all right, we'll check in with you.
132000	135000	Next week, you know, it's kind of a landmark number, so it's 750.
135000	136000	Oh, yeah.
136000	137000	Dark Sakura, not with us tonight.
138000	141000	She'll be joining us a little later via Magic for the Classic Game of the Week, which is
141000	142000	kind of fun this week.
142000	144000	It's a little two-in-one, you'll know what I mean when we get there.
144000	147000	But Dark Sakura, she'll be here next week, and it actually kind of works out, because
147000	152000	next week is 750 episodes of OLR, which, you know, I don't know, like, I know a lot of
152000	156000	podcasts will celebrate 50, 100, and, you know, every episode of which we're celebrating
156000	161000	that your show's still going, you know, 200 and so forth, but, you know, what are the
161000	163000	landmark numbers after, like, 500?
163000	167000	I think 750 could be a landmark number, because it's like three-fourths of the way to 1,000.
167000	169000	I don't know, is 750 kind of a big number?
169000	170000	I think it is.
170000	171000	I think it is a big number.
171000	173000	So Jamie will be here with us next week in studio.
173000	178000	It just happens to also be the week that she's able to arrange her work schedule to be here,
178000	179000	so that'll be very nice.
179000	181000	So, yeah.
181000	184000	But this week, we have a lot of news to get into here at the top of the show.
184000	186000	I wanted to talk about the podcast thing real fast, though.
186000	190000	I know I kind of cracked a joke there, but not that I'm usually one to read other podcasts,
190000	195000	because, you know, I'm a big fan of supporting every indie podcast, and I think you guys should,
195000	199000	you know, I really want to promote people making their own stuff, you know,
199000	202000	especially people that don't feel like they have a voice out there.
202000	205000	I really, especially with some of the news today, good God.
205000	209000	Like, I'm just like, please elevate more voices so people can relate to, you know, people.
209000	212000	And then, anyway, I'm getting on a tangent.
212000	215000	But for, like, some of the non-indie stuff, I got to shade a little bit.
215000	217000	Like, I was checking out this one podcast.
217000	222000	I won't name the podcast, but it's a top 50-ish iTunes show that I do enjoy to listen to.
222000	227000	And I started the show, and I swear to God, it was like the first five and a half minutes
227000	231000	were nothing but there was, like, a commercial at the beginning.
231000	237000	There was an intro where the hosts talk about other shows on the network that you should be listening to.
237000	241000	And then they played a full minute clip from one of those, like, other shows.
241000	244000	And then, like, finally five minutes and a half in, they finally get to the topic.
244000	248000	And I'm like, this is asking a lot of your audience for an hour show.
248000	256000	Like, I realize, as a gaming podcast, it's a three-hour, you know, two to three-hour gaming podcast show.
256000	260000	We don't always get right into the video games, but, you know, at least I'm not, like,
260000	267000	plugging your ear off with other stuff and, you know, mattresses and food supply and books on tape.
268000	273000	I mean, I support podcasters.
273000	275000	That's how they gotta make money nowadays.
275000	278000	I support podcasters' right to make coin, don't get me wrong.
278000	281000	I'm not trying to say, like, oh, we're better than that. That's not what I'm saying at all.
281000	286000	And I told, you know, one day we might have an arrangement, but I would just like to think
286000	290000	not five and a half minutes at the beginning of your show, you know what I mean?
290000	296000	Like, sprinkle it out a little bit. Save it for a commercial break in the middle or something, you know what I mean?
296000	300000	I don't know. What do you guys think in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com?
300000	304000	Because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network,
304000	310000	vognetwork.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, and that's an ad I will always give for free,
310000	312000	is for our pal Bobby Black Wolf, so there you go.
312000	316000	Tigerclaw on chat says, most podcasts use Patreon to support them.
316000	319000	That's true. That's the way a lot of indie podcasts have gone.
320000	328000	Even with the Patreon, though, usually it's like, you know, we've got our Dollar Shave Club and...
328000	330000	Well, that's not Patreon.
330000	332000	Well, no, with that.
332000	335000	Oh, that and commercials. Yeah, I gotcha, I gotcha.
335000	339000	I'm trying to think of all the ones that I commonly hear.
342000	344000	SeatGeek or like...
344000	346000	Well, don't give them all free plugs now.
346000	348000	All the different VPNs and stuff out there.
348000	353000	But anyway, no, I was gonna say, no, I'm fine, and we do not have a Patreon for the record,
353000	357000	but that is a choice that we made for our own reasons,
357000	361000	and if other indie podcasts want to use Patreon to support them, I'm all for that.
361000	363000	Go for it.
363000	368000	So, you know, we have talked about other things that we might do instead of Patreon in the near future,
368000	372000	and if you've been paying attention the last couple months, you can probably figure it out pretty quick,
372000	376000	what direction we are going in, but, you know, I don't know.
376000	380000	Anyway, I'm also going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
380000	382000	Let's see, Dark Tetsuya in chat says,
382000	386000	I can see you doing ads during the break, but right off the bat, come on now.
386000	389000	I'm even okay with like a little opening ad.
389000	394000	Like, okay, I will name this one by name because I'm actually gonna compliment it.
394000	398000	I love this show called Why Won't You Date Me with Nicole Byer.
398000	401000	Have you watched Nailed It on Netflix?
401000	404000	The show with the cakes that they...
404000	406000	Have you seen that? Okay.
406000	408000	She's the host and she's fucking funny.
408000	413000	And she has her own podcast about basically the title, Why Won't People Date Me.
413000	416000	You know, and just get into dating times, like a love relationship type of podcast.
416000	422000	And she always opens with her own ad, but like she's funny and she makes a lot of the stuff funny.
422000	425000	And then it's like the one little ad and then the show.
425000	428000	And, you know, then I think she does another ad in the middle or whatever.
428000	431000	And that's fine because it's one ad.
431000	434000	It's not like a barrage of stuff. You know what I mean?
434000	436000	That's kind of the difference. So, anyway.
436000	439000	Shout out to Nicole Byer. You're my hero.
439000	441000	Let's see.
441000	444000	Also in chat, one more comment and then we'll get into games.
444000	446000	Because you guys were probably sitting there going,
446000	451000	Rob, you're like seven minutes into your show and you still haven't gone into games.
451000	455000	TigerClan chat says, the thing about Patreon is there are some podcasts
455000	459000	who post episodes that only a Patreon subscriber can listen to or view.
459000	462000	Oh, yeah. That's a super common thing. That's a super common thing.
462000	466000	It would be the type of chat that honestly we've been doing for the past five minutes
466000	469000	that we're just giving to you because that's just all we've ever known
469000	471000	in the time that we've been doing podcasting.
471000	476000	But anyway, if you feel so inclined to tip us, there will be ways to do that later on.
476000	480000	But honestly, you know what? We've been doing it for free for 17 years.
480000	482000	Like, are we going to suddenly change it tomorrow?
482000	485000	Or excuse me, 16 years. I'm at the point where we've lost count.
485000	488000	Are we going to just change it overnight? No, we're not going to do that to you.
488000	491000	With tips, we're going to start remembering how many years we've been doing it.
491000	493000	Accurate information.
493000	498000	I can't remember the information that if only I had 50 cents right now.
498000	499000	Alright, anyway.
499000	502000	We almost got the killer, but we ran out of money.
502000	506000	Please insert a quarter to continue the show.
506000	511000	And our show will be the same difficulty level as the Ninja Turtles arcade game back in the day.
511000	514000	We will constantly have to throw quarters into it.
514000	516000	Okay, let's get into our kickoff topic.
516000	518000	Do you want to cover this? You want me to do this?
518000	520000	About the new Intellivision.
520000	522000	So we have a new console that got announced this weekend.
522000	524000	I have no idea what's going on with Intellivision.
524000	527000	Other than Tommy Tallarico is somehow involved and that's it.
527000	530000	He is. So Intellivision never really went away.
530000	533000	Like, Atari sold the name and sold all the rights.
533000	537000	You don't say Atari. He's stealing their stuff.
537000	540000	Well, Intellivision has kind of been there.
540000	543000	They were there for a while. They made their last game very late.
543000	546000	Like, into the late 80s, maybe even early 90s.
546000	548000	So they were making their games for a while.
548000	552000	And then, of course, the company continued to do the Intellivision Lives stuff.
552000	555000	Remember, that was kind of big back when we were working with all games.
555000	558000	Because I remember one of the E3s we were there.
558000	560000	They were like big guests at the event.
560000	562000	Yeah, that was O5 because that was still the original Xbox too.
562000	565000	Yeah, so there was all that going on.
565000	566000	Intellivision has kind of been around.
566000	570000	But now Tommy Tallarico is kind of like he's put money into the company.
570000	576000	And now he's kind of, you know, like the new blood coming in to come up with some new ideas and some new things.
576000	579000	And now we have an idea what that is.
579000	583000	So it's going to be called the Amico is the new system.
583000	585000	Now, I want you to get this out of your heads right away.
585000	588000	This is not a competitor to the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox One.
588000	592000	This is not something that's going to be state-of-the-art graphics and things like that.
592000	596000	In fact, they've very much said that is not what they're doing with this.
596000	603000	They chose to do their big reveal at the Portland Retro Gaming Expo, which is, you know, it's not an E3.
603000	605000	No shade to the Portland Retro Gaming Expo.
605000	607000	I would love to go to the Portland Retro Gaming Expo.
607000	610000	In fact, if I kind of knew that was coming up, I might have gone.
610000	612000	Because Portland is maybe a 10-hour drive. It's not that far.
612000	613000	But anyway, I'm not shading it.
613000	620000	I'm just saying it's not typical you hear about a new console at a thing that's not E3 or even PAX or, you know, some big fan event.
620000	625000	So anyway, they actually announced this is the date we're releasing.
625000	631000	10-10-20. So October 10th, 2020 is the date that they're going to be releasing this console.
631000	636000	No price, but they are aiming for an amount between $149 to $179.
636000	639000	Here's what's something a little different about this.
639000	644000	The controllers are going to be things that you actually put inside the console to use wireless charging.
644000	652000	If you remember the old Intellivision from the 80s, the controllers kind of went in the console too as kind of like their resting space to keep things clean.
652000	656000	But of course they had those big telephone wires that kind of connected it to the actual...
656000	658000	And if you know what I mean by telephone wires...
658000	661000	I only know from a Coleco because a Coleco is basically the same.
661000	671000	But instead of like the number pad, remember the thing that really made the Intellivision different was those little sleeve cards that you would put inside.
671000	673000	You mean the same thing that the ColecoVision had?
673000	675000	Yeah. Intellivision did that too.
675000	679000	You put in those little cards into like the top of the controller.
679000	682000	It was a piece of plastic that sat on top of the buttons.
682000	693000	So instead of just being 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, it would be like, oh, it's a little picture of these four arrows so you know these buttons are move and this one is shoot.
693000	694000	You know, things like that.
694000	695000	Yeah.
695000	698000	Well, what they're going to do with this new system instead is that that's going to be a touchscreen.
698000	700000	So it's kind of something a little different.
700000	701000	Cool.
701000	704000	So they'll have a little disk, but it's not going to be like the disk it was before.
704000	707000	It'll be something that's a little more usable, honestly.
707000	709000	And then a little touchscreen to do that.
709000	711000	So that's kind of a neat little throwback, I suppose.
711000	721000	And then I guess something else they're going to do, which I think this is a really good idea, they're going to have an app for mobile phones that will allow your phone to act as an additional controller.
721000	724000	Which, you know, is obviously a great idea.
724000	730000	I think we started seeing with like Jackbox Party Pack does something like that to have all these different controllers by just using mobile devices.
730000	734000	So the Intellivision is going to have something like that built in.
735000	744000	The console is said to have 21st century 2D chip and architecture, so they are coming out the gate saying 2D games only.
744000	746000	No 3D games.
746000	748000	What about 2.5D? Is that going to be too much?
748000	751000	I don't think you could do that because really 2.5D is 3D.
751000	754000	It's a 2D game kind of made in a 3D space.
754000	757000	Well, I actually know now that I'm blabbing, I don't know.
757000	760000	What would a game like Zelda Link to the Past be considered?
760000	767000	Because it's a 2.5D game, some would call it that because like the above thing, but it's all sprite based, you know what I mean?
767000	772000	That would be like still 2D, but like Donkey Kong Country, it's all pre-rendered.
772000	779000	Yeah, so I guess, okay, it just kind of depends how you are choosing to render that.
779000	783000	If you can run it on the hardware, more power to you, I think.
783000	791000	Exactly. They're saying that the 2D will be stronger than PlayStation 4 and Xbox One because these machines are 3D focused.
791000	800000	So instead of having to fake a 2D game in a 3D rendering engine like Unity, this is something that's going to really focus on 2D games.
800000	810000	And the games will be no more than $8, or if you want to nitpick, $7.99, but we all know that's $8.
810000	815000	So the games will be no more than $8 and no less than $3, $2.99 if I must.
815000	823000	So these are going to be low cost games, and the games will only be E-rated or E-10 rated games.
823000	826000	No violent games allowed, sorry Loki.
826000	834000	And that also means no nudity, so we can't have like booby slapper, the game will not be coming out on the amico, sad to say.
834000	850000	But even something like bungee ferret tossing, our pal YYR is classic, that would probably not be able to be done on television because it's got the fake destruction of animals, opposed to weapons.
850000	854000	You're not bothered by this.
854000	856000	You can just make it less violent.
856000	859000	Just turn the blood into sweat.
860000	862000	Change the blood into sweat.
865000	869000	Anyhow, they want to pitch this as something that parents want to buy.
869000	872000	So you can also see the market they're really aiming for.
872000	876000	They want this to be a family machine, a kid machine.
876000	887000	I wonder if they aren't aiming for a very kind of like, the type of homes that usually shun video games altogether, because video games are the devil type of thing.
887000	898000	Like if this isn't the type of thing where they're kind of more aiming for those types of households where this console, because it has that rule, might be okay I suppose.
898000	903000	There will also be remade Atari and iMagic games, they will be exclusive to the system.
903000	908000	Any game that is remade they say will have updated graphics, audio, added levels, and multiplayer.
908000	913000	The console will allow lots of sprites, so it's going to be a very sprite based thing.
914000	922000	There will also be an occasional retail release of games, though it would be a special and premium price, probably similar to why Switch cartridges are a little more pricey.
922000	927000	But you can imagine that most things are going to be done digitally, as I suppose they are with your mobile phones.
927000	934000	The Amico will come with leaderboard support and some type of achievement system unique to the Amico.
934000	938000	So already Intellivision sounds like they have their online more together than Nintendo, right?
938000	939000	Yes.
939000	941000	Leaderboards and achievements, we got something there.
941000	942000	Really.
942000	944000	Devkits coming out next summer.
944000	948000	Intellivision will be paying developers to make games for the system.
948000	954000	You pitch your game to Intellivision, and if they think it doesn't sound like garbage, they're going to fund your game.
954000	956000	Interesting.
956000	960000	I don't know, do you think they're being too limiting?
960000	964000	Loki, you're grinning ear to ear, what are you going to say with this?
964000	968000	I was going to say, you know, my initial reaction was, ooh yeah!
968000	971000	Because we had the same fucking shit.
971000	973000	I got the joke, I got the joke.
973000	975000	The ooh yeah didn't really do that stuff.
975000	976000	Yes they did.
976000	978000	But that all fell apart quickly.
978000	980000	Right, yeah, I understand that.
980000	985000	Anyway, more details will arrive tomorrow.
985000	993000	So by the time most of you hear this podcast, that's the unfortunate thing about the delay between our live taping here and when most of you guys will actually hear it.
994000	997000	But there are going to be more details Monday, I assume that's going to be in a trailer.
997000	1004000	But I wouldn't expect too much two years out, especially with dev kits not coming out until next year.
1004000	1008000	So, I had a few more notes on this.
1008000	1013000	Loki, any initial thoughts on what I'm saying while I dig up? Because there was a couple of other notes I had on this.
1013000	1015000	I'm cautiously skeptical.
1015000	1017000	How so?
1017000	1019000	I don't want to pay for a new console.
1020000	1032000	Especially with a track record right now, because as much as I, you know, I like Tommy Dalryko, but we'll see what happens when it comes out.
1033000	1044000	Let's see. Oh, yeah, the whole like, there's no financial risk for developers because accepted pitches will be funded by Intellivision and the costs will be from future royalties.
1044000	1046000	Which I find very fascinating.
1046000	1050000	And the other thing was that they will, okay, this is the big one.
1050000	1056000	There was a quote said during the presentation, when did quantity take over for quality?
1056000	1060000	No ports allowed on the console.
1060000	1068000	Which, I mean, that's a lot of borders Intellivision is drawing for its console.
1068000	1073000	No ports, $8 or less, although they'll fund the development, so there's that.
1074000	1079000	And it has to be like a 7 out of 10 type of game. Like no shovelware on Steam.
1079000	1085000	We'll see. I mean, that's tough saying that you don't want ports and stuff.
1085000	1095000	Because how are you going to, that's a, I mean, I understand it's not a risk for development as far as money goes, but time is a risk as well.
1095000	1102000	So am I going to spend like all this time developing a game and then release it on your platform, make no money off of it?
1102000	1107000	I mean, I guess you paid for my development, but still, I mean, it's time as well.
1107000	1110000	Kaijuto in chat says, sounds like a lot of half-baked games.
1110000	1114000	Tigerclaw in chat says, no ports, yet they will have remakes of classic Atari games.
1114000	1122000	You know, I gotta say though, that is one way to kinda open the door and get people interested in this system.
1122000	1127000	I mean, this system probably won't have a problem getting shelf space at a place like Target.
1127000	1132000	Because if you look, if your Target's big enough, right, I mean, they probably don't sell these at like city Targets.
1132000	1138000	But at the, you know, regular sized Targets, if you look, they've got a section where they sell like flashback consoles.
1138000	1144000	And heck, this thing, I forgot to talk about this on the show last night. Do you notice I added a new mini arcade game to my collection?
1144000	1152000	This is a different line of mini arcade things now. And I think it is just simply called My Arcade. That's what it's called.
1152000	1157000	So I got a BurgerTime machine. So that one, you notice it's a little bigger, it's a little fatter than the other ones?
1157000	1162000	And it's honestly, it's probably a slightly little better game that's in there too.
1162000	1168000	Well, obviously it's BurgerTime. It's one of the all-time best. But I paid $35 for that whereas the other ones were $20.
1168000	1179000	But that was at Target. And there's still like three more to get to. I think they had Pac-Man, Galaga, and Dig Dug were the other games that they were offering in that.
1179000	1187000	But my point is, Target sells that stuff. So if the Intellivision, as kind of like a way to get people interested is,
1187000	1198000	yes, not only does it play Atari and Intellivision old games, but it's got the old and the new versions of those games and more.
1198000	1209000	I think that might make Target and some of those retailers perk up because it's basically a retro and then some type of console. Am I right?
1209000	1218000	But I think the leaderboard stuff is where things really get interesting. I'm a big fan of retro gaming. Take a game like BurgerTime.
1219000	1228000	If somebody would just make that, but it actually was just like it ran similar to the old game. They didn't try to go over the top with, you know,
1228000	1234000	because there was a BurgerTime game that came out on WiiWare not that long ago. And it was like you were running around in a 3D environment.
1234000	1242000	And now the burger guy, he has a real name, Peter Pepper or whatever his name is, now he's in a 3D environment and running around.
1242000	1249000	And it's like, no, no, no, just stick to the classic. And so the Intellivision game can kind of stick to the classic and have like leaderboards and stuff.
1249000	1252000	That could be interesting. I don't know. I think I might be into something like that.
1252000	1259000	I'm just curious to see what the games look like and what actually, how it runs and all that. How quickly it's going to be hacked open because they'll be like immediately.
1261000	1263000	Because that sucker's going to be a powerful...
1263000	1268000	Is your goal to get blood and titties on the Intellivision through the art of hacking?
1268000	1271000	Tell me I can't have something. It just makes me want to have it more.
1273000	1275000	Maybe Loki will finally finish a game.
1275000	1278000	Blood, sweat and titties coming out for the Intellivision amico.
1278000	1280000	It's looking less likely every day, unfortunately.
1282000	1288000	There's just so much I'm cramming into my day. Like that is just right now.
1289000	1294000	I'm not even going to pretend that there's progress being made because there's no progress being made.
1294000	1302000	I understand. Also, I think one place where I bet a lot of people are going to kind of lose sight of this when they...
1302000	1306000	Because I can see that there's going to be a lot of armchair critics right now that are going to say,
1306000	1309000	This thing sounds like a flop in the making.
1309000	1311000	This thing sounds like a flop in the making.
1312000	1315000	Oh wait, what? Are you seeing something?
1315000	1322000	Number one, fuck all the way off. Number two, I think some people are not considering the global market.
1322000	1336000	And I think that Tommy Tallarico might be having an eye not just on America and the desire for a guaranteed family-friendly thing, a cost-effective thing in America,
1336000	1339000	but I think the worldwide is a very interesting component.
1340000	1353000	I think if the Intellivision can launch in places like Brazil, Argentina, you know, Africa, places that don't usually get a lot of these top-tier gaming consoles,
1353000	1356000	other parts of the world. The world is a big fucking place, y'all.
1356000	1362000	And if the Intellivision can kind of be a cheaper piece of gaming hardware and launch in some of these other places,
1363000	1370000	then why wouldn't maybe this have success in those places?
1370000	1378000	You know, we talked for a long time about how the Master System was popular for a long time in Brazil, and I think the Genesis still is.
1378000	1385000	I bet the Intellivision would do great in Brazil. And there's a lot of fucking people in Brazil.
1385000	1387000	You know what I mean?
1387000	1390000	Well, why do the other systems not do well?
1390000	1396000	They're too expensive because Sony doesn't have an official presence in a place like Brazil.
1396000	1403000	ActDeaf has called in before to kind of explain this a little bit, but if a company does not have that official presence,
1403000	1408000	and they're manufacturing the consoles in that country or what have you, or the distribution is happening in the country,
1408000	1412000	because obviously PlayStation is made in Japan, they come over here, but it's still being distributed in the US.
1412000	1418000	So if you don't have that official distribution in the country, then you're importing.
1418000	1425000	You have to import everything. And that's where things get crazy, because basically every PlayStation 4 somebody has in a place like Brazil
1425000	1430000	was imported from, at least I think, Sony does not have an official Brazil presence.
1430000	1435000	I am so sorry if I'm incorrect. Obviously I don't live there, I'm not on the up and up.
1435000	1440000	But I believe in a place like Brazil, you have to import a PlayStation 4 from the US.
1440000	1445000	So now you have to buy it from the US and they want to cut it the money.
1445000	1448000	You have to ship it from the US to Brazil and they want to cut it the money.
1448000	1451000	You have to sell it in a Brazil store, they want to cut it the money.
1451000	1453000	These things get more and more expensive.
1453000	1458000	And they become a lot more of a novelty, I suppose.
1458000	1462000	And ActDeaf is backing me up there, thank you. Yeah, pretty much Rob Roberts.
1462000	1470000	And Bobby Blackwolf points out, he does a lot of video game live shows in places like Argentina, Brazil, Chile.
1470000	1476000	Video Games Live sells out soccer stadiums in Brazil. So, there's that too.
1476000	1482000	Caijudo, with another interesting angle, this is going to be the first console for gamers over 50.
1482000	1485000	It's going to be in every old folks home around the world.
1485000	1489000	Caijudo, I get where you're kind of going, I think it's a little tongue in cheek.
1489000	1495000	But, you know what beat the Intellivision to every old folks home in America? The Wii.
1495000	1504000	Remember? Remember when the Wii first came out and all the quote unquote old folks could play Wii bowling in their retirement homes?
1504000	1506000	Like, that stuff was no joke.
1506000	1515000	So, you know, maybe this is a console with a retro edge in mind that will cater to people that I don't necessarily think have to be 50.
1515000	1521000	Caijudo, you're in the danger zone now because I'm 40 and I remember the Intellivision, so watch it.
1522000	1528000	But anyway, let's see, I'm also looking at chat at live.vognetware.com.
1528000	1534000	Dungeonbuster in chat says Sega secured a partnership with a company in Brazil that allowed them to manufacture the hardware.
1534000	1536000	They're giving them a huge advantage early on.
1536000	1542000	That's why the Genesis exploded there and is still being sold because they're literally still making them.
1542000	1544000	Very, very interesting.
1544000	1550000	So, I don't know if the Intellivision is going to have international distribution, but I certainly think this could be something that would be very appealing.
1550000	1558000	And if Tommy Tallarico is selling out soccer stadiums in all these countries, surely he's thinking about that in the back of his mind with these consoles.
1558000	1559000	We'll see.
1559000	1561000	Yeah, we'll see. We'll see.
1561000	1567000	Anyway, alright, I guess that's enough about this console, especially when we don't really have screenshots of games yet.
1567000	1573000	But, you know, I'm not going to write it off as, oh, it's just, you know, garbage because they have all these rules and boundaries.
1573000	1582000	I'm interested. I think this is unique, but I'm not expecting this to be the type of games that are going to, like, blow my fucking mind.
1582000	1585000	But, maybe I will be pleasantly surprised.
1585000	1598000	I would be perfectly happy if it was, like, retro-style Atari 2600 and Intellivision grates that are now, like, online with leaderboard support, which, honestly, we kind of had with GameTap, which has been gone for how long.
1598000	1602000	So, I would like to see a console kind of bring something like that back. I think it would be pretty awesome.
1602000	1611000	So, anyway, let's move on. We got to get into this week's news, and I think we should also get into a little bit of how was your gaming week and what type of video games have you been playing this week.
1611000	1613000	Loki, we'll start with you. How was your gaming week?
1613000	1622000	I've been playing Pokemon Go a little bit. I did the community day stuff today. I evolved a shiny and a non-shiny.
1622000	1643000	And, what else? Oh, DDR. I've been playing lots of DDR because I have been. I've got my setup finally done. Well, I wouldn't say done. It's set up. I did a test stream yesterday, and I've got the two cameras and the video capture working.
1643000	1660000	The game music was a little loud, so I needed to turn that down a bit. It's still adjusting volume levels and stuff, but it's working okay. I think I may cut the back camera because no one wants to stare at my ass while I'm playing the game. I mean, honestly.
1660000	1662000	Or, like, point it down at the arrows.
1662000	1674000	Well, I already have one pointed down at the arrows. The front camera is. So, what I'm actually thinking of doing instead is maybe cutting that camera and doing my heart rate monitor instead.
1674000	1694000	I challenged myself during that to actually play all the difficult non-stop courses with the random ones. Normally, I just stick to the standard difficulty stuff, but I decided to play everything on the heavy difficulties.
1694000	1714000	Apparently, I am not exactly used to that, so that was fun watching my heart rate monitor. It's like, oh, hey, we're up at 170 now. I feel very tired. But, yeah, it worked out okay. It's still kind of rough, but I'm going to hopefully start doing that a little bit more.
1715000	1716000	That's it?
1716000	1717000	That's pretty much it.
1717000	1727000	Let's see, my gaming week. I also did a lot of Pokemon Go. I did Community Day today. I got 11 shinies. That's the best I've ever done on the shiny stuff. Sadly, none of them were any good.
1727000	1740000	But I figure with trading now, one thing I can try doing, and sadly you're limited to one a day because they're shinies, but try to trade, like, a crappy shiny for the same crappy shiny for somebody else, but when you trade the IV shuffle, right?
1740000	1747000	And you might get really lucky and get a lucky Pokemon. Or sometimes you get unlucky with those lucky Pokemons.
1747000	1750000	Unlucky Pokemon. Even worse.
1750000	1769000	I was trading for distance because I had, like, a Meowth from, like, or no, no, it was the other way around. I traded some garbage from here in Sacramento. I don't think it was garbage, though. I think I traded, like, I don't know, it was something like a, like one of the starters, like maybe like a Chimchar or something, one of the new ones.
1769000	1783000	And I traded it to Allen for his New Hampshire Meowth, right? And they traded, and because he hatched to any guy out of New Hampshire, and that came over lucky. So it's like, what am I going to do with a lucky Meowth? A lowland Meowth.
1783000	1784000	What won't you do with that?
1785000	1796000	They're not that great Pokemon. But I've also really liked that. So now what I've started doing, because I still, I still have tons of Unowns from Dragon Con. I still have them all in my inventory.
1796000	1809000	So, like the other night, I was hanging out with some of the Ingress crew, because I was playing Ingress as well. And one of the gals, I hadn't given an Unown yet. And she said, well, what do you want in exchange? And I'm like, just not a Pidgey or not.
1809000	1814000	Because I learned that lesson when Delvin was here, we traded an Unown for a Pidgey and my ass ended up with a lucky Pidgey.
1814000	1815000	Lucky Pidgey.
1815000	1831000	So she was like, okay, I'll give you something you could actually use just in case. And she gave me a Chansey with low IVs. So it was a crappy Chansey for her. And I gave her the Unown and guess what? They went lucky because the Chansey was really old.
1831000	1841000	So I got a Wonder Chansey because when they're lucky, their IVs are guaranteed to be high. And she got a Wonder Unown, which is pretty cool out of the deal. So yeah, that was, that was cool.
1841000	1855000	So now I have a Wonder Blissey. So, but she had named it Frank the Tank. And I think I named it too Bad Janet. I changed the name. So there, cause there's not, I guess when they're going to get hit with a Nerf bat here, when they do the CP reshuffling, she's not going to be very much of a tank anymore.
1855000	1867000	So, um, yeah, so I just named her Bad Janet because that was the, that was the image I had in my mind. So I was able to do a raid today. I got, did you, I got in a low in, uh, Raichu cause I didn't have one of those.
1867000	1874000	Um, I don't know. I need to do more raids cause the game tells me I need to do more raids.
1874000	1881000	I have to do that. And then, um, I don't know.
1881000	1888000	Yeah, just pretty much, um, trying to catch as many of the Beldums as I could.
1888000	1895000	Yeah, just, we were around Capitol Park, just everywhere trying to get them. Uh, sadly I got 11, Alan got two.
1895000	1907000	And he, you know, you usually want three from a shiny day so you can have one of each evolution. That's what most people go for. So of course I gave, cause I'm a nice guy, I gave Alan one of my many extra shinies just so he could have his three.
1907000	1912000	But you know, that is kind of crappy that it's so off balance where I can get 11 and he can get two.
1912000	1917000	Most of mine were just caught with the gotcha. Like anything I tried catching wasn't shiny.
1917000	1926000	The best community day so far in my opinion was the Squirtle one because the quest rewards could be shiny Squirtles if you knew where to go.
1926000	1931000	And so that way everybody was guaranteed like at least a set number of shiny Squirtles. I thought that was the best.
1931000	1943000	I wish this was done on Saturday, not Sunday because I was ready. Like in fact I didn't read the day because normally they're on Saturdays and I was like, okay, I'm ready. Uh, I don't see any.
1943000	1945000	I had to check at the end, I'm like, ah man, it's tomorrow.
1945000	1960000	Uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, dead game. You know, as a funny aside, I was sitting at a Starbucks the other night waiting for a friend and there was this table next to me and there were these three older people that could have come from Kaijuto's Intellivision old folks home.
1960000	1969000	There was, they weren't that old, but they were, you know, they were, they were mature in love and life because I could clearly see these three individuals were all playing Pokemon Go.
1969000	1974000	Cause you know, you know, if you've watched somebody or you've played Pokemon Go, you could tell they were playing, throwing curve balls.
1974000	1980000	They're like drawing that little circle on their phone and you know, throwing the whole thing. Like nobody does that to their phone unless they're playing Pokemon Go.
1980000	1986000	That's not, unless you want to make a joke about old people sending text messages. That's not what they were doing. Okay. They were clearly playing Pokemon Go.
1986000	1995000	So I actually said, I kind of made a joke. I was like, oh, you guys are playing Pokemon Go as well. And the one, you know, lady just lit up and she's like, oh yes, we love Pokemon Go so much.
1995000	2002000	And we just got my sister involved. Why don't, I've never seen you at a raid. What's your name? Do you raid around here? And this was at a Starbucks near my work.
2002000	2015000	So I don't usually raid there, uh, because I go home and I raid usually in this area. Um, so I didn't know this lady, but you know, we, we, so I connected with this lady that was older on Pokemon Go, which is interesting.
2015000	2032000	I'm not used to talking to folks 20 years older than I am about video games. I don't remember doing that when I was younger. So that's kind of, you know, interesting little thing about the world that's different now, I suppose. So, um, anyway, Bobby.
2032000	2043000	Oh my God. Horrible comment in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and this comment came straight out of the mouth of black Wolf saying she'll be dead soon. Just like that game.
2043000	2054000	That's a horrible thing to say. I'm sorry. You're must be referring to like ingress. Yeah, exactly. You click. Yeah, you're free ingress. Uh, dungeon buster says that got dark real fast.
2054000	2072000	Yeah. Bobby dark sided Wolf anyway. Or maybe like, you know, Garfield go anyway. Shut up. All right. Uh, other stuff I play, I played more than what you want to go cause I played world of Warcraft working on my monk, uh, just about to hit level 60, which has been, you know, fun, uh, playing my monk and leveling that up.
2072000	2082000	And, uh, I've been playing some more with friends online a little bit. I got into Delvin's Guild with that character. So, you know, at least I, I'm not alone on there. So just trying to make my way to max level.
2082000	2091000	Um, and I was toying around with potentially starting a mage on there as well. Uh, and maybe using my boost to do that. Cause I don't know if I want to tank everything at a high level and we'll see.
2091000	2106000	Um, and then, um, also I was, I was walking around, uh, downtown, uh, the other night and I ended up at the, uh, the bar that has all the old arcade games, you know, the coin op. Yeah. And, uh, I played around immortal combat too.
2106000	2120000	And I'm so happy that to this day I can still remember how to do Katana's fatality. It's very easy. If you don't remember Katana's fatality, you just mash the block button cause you have to hit it like three or four or five times. I don't remember how many times.
2120000	2127000	But you have to hit the block button like four times. So you just hit the mash the block button and then hit high kick. And that's how she chops off the person's head with their fan.
2127000	2136000	And I remember that all these years later. So I was able to, uh, do fatalities on a Mortal Kombat 2 machine this week. I also played a fancy new, uh, pinball machine called Houdini.
2137000	2149000	Very fancy. It was a, I don't know the company that makes all these newer games. I wish Jamie was here to, to tell me, maybe somebody in chat knows, but they, they must've done the, the new Batman, uh, sixties series table as well.
2149000	2159000	And I think they have a Star Wars table. Like they all have these like video screens in the back instead of dot matrix things. Yeah. And so this new one's called Houdini and it was a very flashy machine.
2159000	2166000	Uh, even though like really taunted me when I wasn't doing very well. Oh, Blackwell says it's Stern that does those machines. Oh, that's pretty cool.
2166000	2176000	Uh, hit stun says Jersey Jack. I think they do the Wizard of Oz one. I don't know if they did this one. So I think, um, oh, Blackwell says Houdini is by American pinball.
2176000	2184000	I guess I think pinball is making somewhat of a retro comeback. Um, just, you know, I know there's, you know, the various collectors, obviously we hear Jamie talk about it on the show a lot.
2184000	2191000	And I think just, you know, in general, there's, there's very much a scene for that. So it's kind of neat, but otherwise that was really my gaming week. I didn't play.
2191000	2197000	I wanted to get Soul Calibur six, but I just didn't get around to it this weekend. I was a little bit busy, so I did end up picking that up.
2197000	2205000	But that's still on my agenda for this week is to pick up Soul Calibur six. Cause, uh, I I'm seeing all the character creator things people are doing and I've just always enjoyed this whole caliber series.
2205000	2217000	So I want to pick that game up. So, all right, we're going to get into some gaming news for the night. Uh, I, after I do some housekeeping of which I don't think I have a lot of stuff to announce right now.
2217000	2225000	We will be missing a show in November. I want to say it's like November 17th or so, uh, because I will be in Las Vegas at Final Fantasy Fan Fest.
2225000	2233000	And I won't be back in time because we're driving back on Sunday. And in order to be back in time for the show, we would have to leave Las Vegas by 8 AM.
2233000	2241000	I'm going to tell you right now, it's not going to happen. So, uh, no show, uh, that weekend. So you can, uh, plan accordingly.
2241000	2247000	So anyway, uh, let's get into, I hear Mr. Smoosh screaming in the background, so I'm going to go see what the hell's his problem is.
2247000	2251000	And while Loki starts to get into some gaming news for tonight.
2251000	2260000	Yes. So one of my favorite series is actually coming out again here pretty soon, um, with the sequel of Red Dead Redemption.
2260000	2271000	So Red Dead Redemption 2. And of course, Rockstar was in the news this week because, you know, getting ready for the launch of Red Dead Redemption 2 has caused a bit of crunch time.
2271000	2282000	And they were talking about, I guess, this was during an article published in New York Magazine about, um, you know, how they were working 100 hour weeks, you know, getting ready for the game.
2282000	2293000	You know, the polishing, rewrites, uh, reedits, um, are, does, uh, the Rockstar does arm ends. We were working 100 hour weeks.
2293000	2301000	Um, we probably made 70 versions, but the editors, uh, make several hundred.
2301000	2311000	Uh, Sam and I will both make a lot of suggestions as well as other members of the team talking about, uh, the different TV commercials and trailers and stuff that they shot as well.
2311000	2319000	Um, some of the work they did during those 100 hour weeks, 300,000 animations, 500,000 lines of dialogue, and lots of code.
2319000	2335000	Um, of course, recently, studios have come under fire because of these really crunch time periods where kind of the whole morale of the workforce is low because they're being forced to work these immense hours.
2335000	2342000	Um, not exactly good for the employees, but necessary, I guess, to release the game on time.
2342000	2352000	Um, so because of that, there's been lots of developers speaking out about it. In fact, I guess there was some ban on social media talking about these hours as well.
2353000	2359000	So, um, some of the feedback people were leaving on Twitter and Facebook, for example.
2359000	2365000	Uh, one's from Keith Thorburn, who he works in the music department at Rockstar North.
2365000	2372000	He's saying, first off, this was one of the most rewarding and least stressful projects that I worked on.
2372000	2378000	I know what an epic crunch feels like, but this was managed in such a way that I felt happy and healthy.
2378000	2391000	And then, of course, um, you know, there, there's a comment from Dan Houser, who is the head of, um, you know, Rockstar, basically saying, you know, um, we were, you know, kind of referring back to those.
2391000	2395000	We don't ask or expect anyone to work anything like that.
2395000	2404000	Um, it sounds like more that the team was kind of motivated to work these hours because of the hard work that they put into it.
2405000	2412000	There's peer pressure a lot with this stuff, too. You know, it's like, oh, you're not going to work overtime? Okay.
2412000	2413000	Yeah.
2413000	2415000	We'll see how that goes for you when review time comes around.
2415000	2422000	Well, like another coder, Phil Beveridge, he's saying, you know, in the time that I've been with the studio, work practices have definitely improved.
2422000	2433000	Crunch on Red Dead Redemption 2 has definitely been a lot better than it was on GTA 5, where I was pulling a month of 70 plus hour work weeks, um, while being told by my boss at the time to go home.
2433000	2440000	Um, I've never worked more than, and then of course, there's another guy, uh, or woman, I should say Vivian Langdon.
2440000	2442000	She's a tools programmer.
2442000	2447000	So she's saying I've never worked more than maybe 50 hours a week.
2447000	2452000	And that's a rare occurrence by generally work about two to six hours of paid overtime per week.
2452000	2462000	So it sounds like that it's not so much like, oh my God, I hate working here, but it's that they, they treat their employees well, which I imagine with the amount of money that they bring in.
2462000	2469000	Like, especially from like Grand Theft Auto 5, they probably can do that, but I know that's not always the same with other studios.
2469000	2477000	I mean, hell, just recently with Telltale Games, we were hearing about, you know, just kind of the shit that they were putting their employees through.
2477000	2481000	And you know, now with all this lack of severance and everything, that kind of sucks.
2481000	2487000	Um, and then of course, the, this also applies to the QA testers as well.
2487000	2496000	So they were basically saying that the Rockstar QA studio was told that overtime is optional after they, the workers were saying that it felt mandatory.
2496000	2505000	Through the conversations we've been having, it's clear to us that the requested scheduled overtime feels like an obligation to some, if not many of the team.
2505000	2511000	We therefore spoke to them, made sure that it's clear that overtime is not mandatory.
2511000	2519000	So at least it seems like they're taking some action to make sure that the workforce is not overly stressed.
2519000	2524000	That's good. I guess that's more accountability than we see from some other studios.
2524000	2528000	But you know, I don't know if crunch time is necessarily a great thing.
2528000	2531000	No, it's, I would think it's the result of poor planning.
2531000	2534000	But this thing's been good. They've been developing this game for a long time.
2534000	2535000	Right!
2535000	2536000	I mean, I don't know.
2536000	2541000	I don't know. Why does it seem like every bad news thing that happens in the industry comes back to management?
2541000	2544000	I mean, no wonder the employees want to unionize.
2544000	2549000	And I mean, when it comes to like this crunch time stuff and all this, like I, I kind of think they deserve it.
2549000	2553000	I mean, I realize it gets political and people have their, you know, feelings about it.
2553000	2560000	But like when this is just this recurring theme over and over and over again, like I can't help but like ask the question, like, how is this being managed?
2560000	2564000	Like, why aren't you planning for enough hours or why aren't you staffing adequately?
2564000	2570000	Well, money. We all know that. To, uh, you'll be, be, have enough time to do these things.
2570000	2577000	I gotta tell you though, if you're feeling really stressed out being a tester at Rockstar Games, you can always go work for Bethesda because those testers don't work very long hours at all.
2577000	2579000	Stop it. Because you know.
2579000	2581000	I know they do. I know they work hard.
2581000	2584000	You know those testers find stuff that management doesn't fix.
2584000	2589000	They work hard. They find all of the bugs but they just don't fucking care because they're Bethesda and they gotta release the game and we love them.
2589000	2592000	And it becomes self-parody at some point. Exactly.
2592000	2600000	So, um, all this news though, you as the gamer, the consumer, uh, you, you could care less and are still gonna get Red Dead Redemption 2, right?
2600000	2601000	Yes.
2602000	2603000	I'm part of the problem.
2603000	2606000	Maybe that's the problem at the end of the day. Who knows.
2606000	2608000	Uh, go into some more comments in our chat over.
2608000	2613000	I gotta tell Rockstar Games to stop making such good games. You know, maybe focus more on, um, some Table Tennis games.
2613000	2620000	Live.vog.net.org.com. Bobby kind of reinforcing there. The testers do care. They report it. The managers decide not to fix.
2620000	2624000	That is kind of what I was trying to get out there between Loki's little, little fucking around.
2624000	2630000	Uh, Sia Tabiri in chat says, I mean it could be that they're looking for such specific qualities they won't hire new people.
2630000	2634000	I've known some managers to have that kind of struggle. You know what though?
2634000	2642000	To not plan. To have a plan to replace. And maybe this is just my passion because I do a lot of like training for a living.
2642000	2648000	If you don't have a plan on how you're gonna replace your good people and how you can train people on those unique skill sets.
2648000	2655000	You are setting yourself up for fucking failure. Because there is nothing you can do if somebody, especially in California, it's an at-will state.
2655000	2662000	There are no contracts. The Powerball, no the Mega Millions is 1.6 billion dollars.
2662000	2667000	If your employee wins the Mega Millions or, you know, that thing, you cannot control.
2667000	2673000	They're gonna walk into that office on Monday and go, fuck you, I quit. And there is nothing you can do.
2673000	2676000	It doesn't matter how skilled they are. There is nothing you can do.
2676000	2683000	So if you don't have a plan, that's your problem as a manager. You as a manager need to have that plan.
2683000	2689000	So, I mean, in my opinion, that is still a fault of the management if the skills are too specialized.
2689000	2694000	Now I'm not saying that employees with special skill sets aren't valuable. Of course they are.
2694000	2697000	And that's why, you know, that type of seniority and that stuff should be rewarded too.
2697000	2701000	But if you're not planning to lose that, because you don't know.
2701000	2708000	I mean, you know, I'm joking about Mega Millions, but somebody could, I don't want to be dark, but somebody could suddenly pass away.
2708000	2714000	There's nothing you can do about it. Somebody could get pregnant and they have the right to go out for so many weeks under law for FMLA and baby bonding and all that stuff.
2714000	2719000	You know, if you don't have a plan, you're a bad manager. So, anyway.
2719000	2727000	And see, Tiberi does, you know, qualify that saying. I'm not saying it's justified. Oh, no, no, I'm not saying you were, but I just want to make sure that kind of point is clear.
2727000	2733000	Is that, you know, if these guys, I'm sure these guys are very skilled at Rockstar's systems and software and all that stuff.
2733000	2740000	But if Rockstar doesn't have a way to at least get new people and ramp up to that same sort of skill set, then they're just setting themselves up for failure.
2740000	2746000	So, anyway. Gaming unions, you think it's something we're going to see in the next few years?
2746000	2748000	Maybe. I don't think so, though.
2748000	2754000	I think if this Telltale thing doesn't make it happen, I'm not sure anything will. After what those guys all went through.
2755000	2759000	But you'll notice it's now been about two weeks and people aren't really talking about that anymore.
2759000	2762000	Well, this isn't necessarily a new thing either.
2762000	2769000	A friendly reminder from Orange Lounge Radio. Bad management at Telltale fucked over a lot of people unnecessarily.
2769000	2777000	Just a friendly reminder in case you forgot. Two weeks ago, that was a big thing. So, never forget. Bad management fucked over all those people unnecessarily.
2778000	2787000	Anyhow. I feel I feel like we need like PSAs here at Orange Lounge Radio.
2787000	2796000	Also, there was a massive leak with many of what was it? What was the credit card monitoring company?
2796000	2798000	Oh, you mean like Equifax?
2798000	2800000	Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Remember that?
2800000	2804000	Yeah. Friendly reminder. Equifax lacked leaked all your credit information.
2804000	2806000	And Facebook several times.
2806000	2814000	That's right. Yep. Friendly reminder that Super Smash Brothers got delayed several times and you didn't care because the game came out actually really good.
2816000	2821000	Hitstun in chat says, sadly bad management is not news. It's too common.
2821000	2827000	Oh, I'm sure everybody has a story in their life where at one point or another they worked for a bad manager.
2827000	2831000	I mean, that's just that's just part of the big wide world out there, isn't it?
2831000	2838000	Alright. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says Grand Theft Auto 4 was delayed for a long time and nobody cares now.
2838000	2840000	So, anyway.
2840000	2842000	I cared greatly then.
2842000	2847000	But you don't now because you ended up being like one of the top 100 players in the world at Grand Theft Auto 4.
2847000	2851000	That's why I cared because I wanted to play right away.
2851000	2852000	Alright.
2852000	2859000	We were playing the PSP version in Saints Row. That's right. I was one of the dozens that were playing Saints Row multiplayer online.
2859000	2863000	Can we talk about cat that drama for a minute? Like, I just.
2863000	2868000	OK, so Mr. Smoosh is out here screaming. So I gave him some little kibble. I don't even think it's feeding time. Alan doesn't even know I gave him kibble.
2868000	2872000	So I gave him a little kibble and I filled up his water bowl completely because it was looking a little.
2872000	2876000	And now it's been that held him over for five minutes and now he's back out here yelling again.
2876000	2878000	That's cats.
2878000	2880000	Y'all.
2880000	2883000	That's why our cat tries to wake us up at like five in the morning.
2883000	2885000	No, that. No, no.
2885000	2889000	And she and she wants a treat. She's like, I treats. And I'm like, I'm throwing your ass in the garage.
2889000	2894000	That's that's that's why we I sleep with earplugs and we shut the door.
2894000	2898000	So she'll scratch the door. And if she doesn't wake us up, she'll go wake the kids up.
2898000	2902000	That's so I like you fucking asshole.
2902000	2908000	She'll do that, too. Like it could be just like at random, like just I have to remind you that I'm an asshole.
2908000	2913000	Like, you know, you'll be sitting there watching TV. She's curled up in your lap. You're petting her.
2913000	2916000	She's like enjoying life. She's getting full attention.
2916000	2921000	She'll just get up, stretch out, hop down, go scratch at the door of the kids.
2921000	2926000	I'm like, what the fuck is your problem? Why the fuck are you doing this?
2926000	2932000	I was paying attention to you a hundred percent and you have to go and be an asshole.
2932000	2939000	All right. Speaking of assholes, I see a lot of them on Facebook. How do you like that transition?
2939000	2945000	Let's talk about Facebook for a minute. Facebook. Did you know Facebook has a whole gaming platform built into it?
2945000	2948000	It's something called instant games. I just got my block all that shit.
2948000	2957000	I got my first one today because one of my friends posted a thing that was like, come look at my rap album that, you know, it's like one of those meme quiz things.
2957000	2963000	And so I tapped on it and it was like, do you want to install OMG? No, no, no.
2963000	2973000	It's like this application will receive your name, your real name, your mailing address, your friends list, your privacy, your blood, your semen sample.
2973000	2980000	I'm like, good Lord. Why does this game need everything? It's crazy.
2980000	2982000	We already have it.
2982000	2989000	So anyway, so instant games is a thing and unfortunately this is only going to get bigger.
2989000	2996000	Now, I don't see where like, see my rap album was supposed to be a big game unless I missed out on karaoke or something.
2996000	2997000	I don't know. Maybe that's the thing.
2997000	3008000	But apparently Facebook games is now also coming to Facebook groups and the Facebook light app because, you know, Facebook isn't confident enough just having one app on your phone.
3008000	3011000	You have to have a separate message. Well, you don't have to do anything.
3011000	3017000	And I know many of you don't. But, you know, if you want to be able to talk to people and stuff, you have to have the Facebook Messenger app on your phone.
3017000	3024000	You have to have the Facebook groups thing to manage pages. You have to have the, like, because one app isn't enough, Facebook wants to have all these apps on your phone.
3024000	3027000	And now they're putting this gaming platform on all of them.
3027000	3036000	So anyhow, the future will be available to all gaming groups if your group is flagged as like a gaming related thing, meaning members can play with each other.
3036000	3040000	They are playing with a feature to make it opt in for all groups.
3040000	3045000	Anyhow, they're saying that they're seeing an increase with active players and all this other stuff.
3045000	3049000	And I'm like, who's playing these games? I'm sure not. But I do, I mean,
3049000	3051000	Is Farmville still a thing?
3051000	3057000	I don't, I think it is still a thing, but it's not like the thing it used to be.
3057000	3068000	But I mean, you know, for better or for worse, and oftentimes when it comes to Facebook, mostly worse, you can pull up a game right into the Facebook app.
3068000	3074000	And it's like you're not downloading a separate app or anything. It's like basically like you're playing like the Flash game or whatever, but on your phone.
3074000	3078000	You know, the one I do remember playing in Messenger was like a Pac-Man thing.
3078000	3086000	And it actually, you could see like your ranking against other players in the group, but like the people in my messaging group, like nobody else wanted to play it.
3086000	3093000	And it's just Pac-Man. It's not like we're playing it at the same time or anything like that. I don't know.
3093000	3097000	Anyhow, Facebook gaming, it's still a thing, believe it or not.
3097000	3104000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Let's see. You know what's funny? I thought this was a comment about Facebook.
3104000	3110000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, yeah, sounds like my dogs. They go crazy for a biscuit and five minutes later they want another one.
3110000	3114000	I seriously thought that was a comment about Facebook and all of its apps.
3114000	3118000	And not a comment about Mr. Smoosh.
3118000	3122000	But I mean, if it fits, apply it, right?
3122000	3126000	If it fits, it's no.
3126000	3134000	Sia Tabiri in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, friendly for Facebook when you want to filter out 60% of your friends' feeds.
3134000	3138000	And Dungeon Buster says, in a way it kind of makes sense with Facebook. Exactly.
3138000	3142000	Install my new app. Meow, meow, meow. Install my new app. Meow, meow, meow.
3142000	3147000	You can't talk with your friends unless you do a new app. Meow, meow, meow.
3147000	3153000	Are you sure you don't want to give us your blood type? Because we might need to know your blood type.
3153000	3157000	Meow, meow, meow. Or like, where do you work? We need to know where you work. Where'd you go to school?
3157000	3161000	Where are you right now? I can see you, but where are you?
3161000	3165000	We're noticing that you're at a fancy restaurant right now with somebody who isn't your spouse.
3165000	3170000	Do you wish to check in here and write a review?
3170000	3175000	And tell all your friends you were here? I fucking hate Google Maps does that shit sometimes.
3175000	3181000	We're like, I'll be at the park. It's like, do you know something about this park?
3181000	3186000	Like, fill in some data for us. I'm like, fuck off. I'm just trying to get directions somewhere.
3186000	3191000	The thing that gets me is I'll go somewhere and I'll just open Facebook to like check my feed or something.
3191000	3196000	Albeit like a store. And then like a day later, I see ads for the store I was in.
3196000	3201000	And I wasn't even doing anything on Facebook with it. I didn't check in there or anything like that. Nope. Facebook just knew I was there.
3201000	3209000	Yeah, my wife insists, and I've heard a lot of people insist as well, that she was talking with her friend about something.
3209000	3214000	And not even like didn't bring it up in Facebook or whatever. And all of a sudden just started receiving ads about it.
3214000	3220000	And they claim they're not listening. They claim that. Just like they claim that the data hasn't been breached.
3220000	3224000	To the extent that it was. But they're fucking liars.
3224000	3227000	Do you think Zuckerberg's listening to this right now?
3227000	3233000	Because they have fucking liar money is what they have. They have money where it's like, oh, we need to pay a fine.
3233000	3238000	Here's the fine money. And we're just going to keep doing what the fuck we were doing before because we make a lot more money to offset it.
3239000	3245000	All right. Let's take off the tinfoil hats, although, I mean, are they tinfoil if what we're saying is pretty much true.
3245000	3248000	Let's move on to some more news. Loki.
3248000	3257000	So much like we got the high end, you know, analog, was it? I remember it's called like Super NT, analog NT.
3257000	3266000	Anyways, now we're going to be getting the Mega SG, which is a high end Sega system.
3266000	3275000	So it's going to play Genesis, Mega Drive, Master System games, outputting all the video from them with 10 AP and zero latency.
3275000	3281000	It's supposed to be coming out April twenty nineteen. It's going to retail for one hundred and ninety dollars.
3281000	3290000	And they're saying that they're even going to have add ons to play, I think, Sega CD, which is ridiculous.
3290000	3294000	Yeah, Sega CD or Mega CD games.
3294000	3301000	So neat that you can do that. And then they have also other cartridge adapters that plug in.
3301000	3306000	So you can even use looks like Game Gear and.
3306000	3315000	I can't really tell what else is in there. Oh, Game Gear, Sega, my card, SG 1000 and SC 3000.
3315000	3319000	Not familiar with those systems, but needs.
3319000	3324000	I mean, I don't have a need for this, but it's cool that it's a thing.
3324000	3327000	Sure. Why not? All the retro consoles. Why not?
3327000	3331000	I mean, now you got to find one just take a Genesis games and stuff to play.
3331000	3336000	Speaking of retro consoles, one of my friends on Facebook got one of those Commodore 64 minis.
3336000	3340000	Yeah. And I was like, oh, how are this? Because I've kind of heard mixed reviews on them.
3340000	3343000	I kind of I kind of want one, even though the reviews are kind of mixed.
3343000	3350000	And yes, I know damn well I can do the same thing with a Raspberry Pi and all that shit.
3350000	3354000	It's a collector's item. Exactly. It's a collector's item and I want it.
3354000	3360000	Anyway, even if the games that are included are apparently not really the best ones, but it is what it is.
3360000	3362000	Can't you hack that thing to put the other ones on there? Oh, I'm sure you can.
3362000	3365000	In fact, I think I think actually the sideloading is like wide open.
3365000	3369000	I think that thing fully embraces D64 images probably.
3369000	3370000	We know you're going to do this anyway.
3370000	3375000	Well, well, and also because the technology at this point is so old, it's from the 80s.
3375000	3380000	I'm pretty sure any type of trademark or patent has probably fallen off at least the disk type.
3380000	3382000	So if people want to do it, they're going to do it. You know what I mean?
3382000	3384000	Yep. So.
3384000	3386000	All right. Well, moving on to some new things.
3386000	3390000	Some of you might be picking up Diablo three on the switch.
3390000	3392000	I let's I'm not going to try to lie.
3392000	3395000	Like I'll probably end up being one of them, even though I already own this game.
3395000	3397000	You'll tease me for Mass Effect three when I buy that.
3397000	3400000	But this will be like the third or fourth platform I bought.
3400000	3401000	I can't even remember.
3401000	3404000	You'll buy Mass Effect again when this comes out on the switch.
3404000	3409000	If if they do a Mass Effect remastered trilogy, you bet your ass I'm going to buy it again.
3409000	3415000	Absolutely. But anyway, Diablo three is, of course, coming out on the switch.
3415000	3418000	And you know, why? Why stop at just doing a mere port?
3418000	3420000	You know, Nintendo and Blizzard.
3420000	3426000	You know, Nintendo really loves that Blizzard is crawling into their bed a little bit by putting out Diablo three on the system.
3426000	3429000	Oh goody, what amiibo support are we getting now?
3429000	3436000	Well, I think it's more like Nintendo is like, if you will put Overwatch on this console, like we will give you favors.
3436000	3440000	You know, like I think Nintendo would love to have something like Overwatch.
3440000	3441000	Tracer and Smash.
3441000	3443000	Even.
3444000	3446000	You should watch those things that come out of your mouth.
3446000	3452000	All right. Anyway, I'm going on into I don't think that would really happen, but fucking you never know.
3452000	3461000	Anyway, I'm going to a story about Diablo three and the special limited edition console that's going to come out on November 2nd.
3461000	3467000	So it's the Diablo three eternal collection is the game, of course, that's coming on November 2nd.
3467000	3477000	You can get a whole hoopla thing for three hundred fifty nine bucks with a Nintendo switch dock that features Diablo three artwork.
3477000	3481000	You can get a carrying case that features Diablo three art.
3481000	3486000	So if you want to look like you're carrying Satan with you everywhere you go, which some of you do.
3486000	3487000	Yes.
3487000	3491000	Then then you can have your you know, your whole like switch themed case.
3491000	3498000	I'd actually I'd buy the case if they sold it separately, although my I have a Mario Kart eight case right now that's pretty solid.
3498000	3500000	But I would pick this up maybe if they sold it separately.
3500000	3505000	So, yeah, they're going to do a full on little bundle with a theme dock and everything.
3505000	3508000	So I guess that's pretty cool. I already have a switch.
3508000	3509000	So that's that.
3511000	3514000	Apparently, Blizzard is also doing like a virtual treasure hunt, basically.
3514000	3518000	They're hiding things around the Internet and real world locations.
3518000	3523000	And when you find them, you might get prizes like that Nintendo switch bundle I just talked about.
3523000	3527000	You might also end up with the digital copy of the game or some of the other collectible items.
3527000	3529000	So that's kind of interesting. They're doing their whole little loot hunt.
3529000	3531000	So you might be mugged.
3532000	3534000	I guess it depends what real world places you want to go to.
3534000	3537000	You know, I was thinking about this the other day.
3537000	3540000	You know, Blizzard's working on some secret projects, right?
3540000	3543000	Of course, of course, Blizzard's working on secret projects, right?
3543000	3546000	And it seems less and less likely Diablo four is what they're going to announce.
3546000	3549000	But they're probably going to announce something Diablo.
3549000	3551000	I don't think they're going to announce Diablo three expansion.
3551000	3554000	I think Diablo Diablo mobile is coming.
3554000	3557000	I think that's I don't know if it's necessarily Diablo three,
3557000	3561000	but it's either going to be a Diablo two remasters and be Diablo mobile.
3561000	3564000	And I was just thinking about like, you know, Blizzard,
3564000	3567000	because I think I was kind of thinking about this while I was playing Pokemon Go.
3567000	3572000	Certainly Blizzard has to be thinking about what can we do in the real world?
3573000	3576000	Can you imagine Blizzard doing something like Pokemon Go?
3576000	3577000	And don't take that literally.
3577000	3580000	I'm not talking about collecting little orcs and things from World of Warcraft
3580000	3582000	or the Blizzard characters in the real world.
3582000	3586000	But I'm talking about imagine if Blizzard took its little touch on things
3586000	3588000	and did it with like AR games.
3588000	3590000	Wouldn't that be interesting?
3590000	3591000	I don't know.
3591000	3592000	Sure.
3592000	3594000	You wouldn't play a Blizzard AR game?
3594000	3598000	I don't have as much love for Blizzard as a lot of people do.
3598000	3599000	A lot of people do.
3599000	3600000	I'm not doubting that.
3600000	3601000	All right.
3601000	3603000	Anyway, just a few more stories for you guys,
3603000	3605000	and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
3605000	3606000	But first, Loki.
3606000	3607000	All right.
3607000	3612000	Well, this is unfortunate if you're waiting to get a copy of Starlink from Best Buy.
3612000	3613000	Apparently, it's...
3613000	3615000	Oh, you mean Starfox?
3615000	3616000	Uh, yes.
3616000	3620000	The game that features Starfox but is not Starfox.
3620000	3622000	The Toys of Life game.
3622000	3623000	Yes.
3623000	3628000	Starlink Battle for Atlas had a starter kit that they sold at Best Buy.
3628000	3633000	And apparently, those copies of the game, or at least some of them,
3633000	3636000	were missing the game.
3636000	3640000	So you got the accessories, but you got no game.
3640000	3644000	And that's a problem, because you kind of need the game to play the game.
3644000	3649000	But apparently, Ubisoft is aware, and they're investigating,
3649000	3650000	basically saying to you,
3650000	3655000	hey, we made aware of a small amount of Starlink Battle for Atlas starter packs
3655000	3659000	that we have shipped without a copy of the disc, or cartridge included.
3659000	3663000	We are currently investigating the scope and issue of these,
3663000	3666000	and potential solutions for this issue.
3666000	3672000	They were saying, of course, if you received a copy of Starlink without the game in the box,
3672000	3677000	contact support.ubi.com to resolve that issue.
3677000	3680000	Complain loudly on the internet about it, because that's what people do.
3680000	3681000	We fucked up.
3681000	3683000	Dope.
3683000	3688000	But, you know, I have no interest in this game, honestly.
3688000	3692000	I don't need a new Toys to Life game.
3692000	3697000	I need more of the ones that we have already, like more Disney Infinity.
3697000	3699000	Disney Infinity 4.0 would have been fucking awesome.
3699000	3701000	Disney Infinity is dead and gone, and it's never coming back.
3701000	3702000	I know it's dead and gone.
3702000	3704000	Same with the LEGO game.
3704000	3706000	It's sad.
3706000	3707000	It is.
3707000	3708000	But they're trying.
3708000	3710000	They're like, we can do it.
3710000	3712000	I just think it's going to fail.
3712000	3714000	But Star Fox.
3714000	3716000	Star Fox ain't going to save that shit.
3716000	3717000	I'm sorry.
3717000	3721000	It may get a few copies sold, but no one.
3721000	3728000	Then again, then again, that's like saying, Spyro Toys to Life game.
3728000	3730000	Spyro's not going to sell that shit.
3730000	3733000	But then people are like, fucking, who the fuck is Spyro?
3733000	3735000	I love Skylanders, you know?
3735000	3738000	And I'm like, you're a fucking blasphemous piece of shit.
3739000	3744000	Sia Tabarian Chat says, we need more passive aggressive people on the internet talking about not getting their games.
3748000	3750000	That was a really good read.
3751000	3752000	Good job, chatters.
3752000	3753000	Alright.
3754000	3762000	Anyway, something that may or may not be dead and gone and never coming back, but it's certainly temporarily gone.
3762000	3765000	NBA 2K Playgrounds, or NBA Playgrounds.
3765000	3766000	It's gone.
3766000	3769000	It's gone. The first game is gone.
3769000	3774000	The NBA Playgrounds disappeared from the Switch eShop and no word on why or if it's ever coming back.
3774000	3777000	And nothing of value was lost.
3777000	3783000	It is awfully interesting that NBA 2K Playgrounds 2 just came out.
3783000	3785000	You can get that one just fine.
3785000	3789000	So when the part two came out, the first one is now gone.
3789000	3790000	That's interesting.
3790000	3794000	What they did is they took it down and they added the number two and they put it back up.
3796000	3797000	And updated the year in the rosters.
3797000	3798000	And then the year in the roster.
3800000	3803000	By golly, Loki, I think you might be onto something.
3804000	3810000	Also, speaking of games that were pulled from the Nintendo Switch eShop, a game called One Strike has been pulled.
3810000	3812000	This one they are saying is temporary.
3812000	3815000	It's a very interesting reason why it's been pulled.
3816000	3822000	They found that some music was lifted from what I would call an obscure Famicom title.
3822000	3825000	And I'm calling it obscure because it was never out over here.
3825000	3827000	So most of you probably don't know it.
3827000	3835000	So anyway, thanks to the magic of YouTube, we actually can hear a little bit of the music from this game which was called Morayu Senkai Madara.
3835000	3840000	So this was the game and this was some of the music from that game if YouTube will cooperate with it.
3845000	3852000	Not a bad soundtrack for an NES game for Famicom.
3852000	3854000	It's a pretty good song, yeah.
3854000	3856000	So that was the song of the game.
3856000	3862000	And now here is some actual gameplay that somebody put on YouTube of them playing One Strike.
3862000	3867000	And if you forward to about eight minutes into this video, you hear this song in one of the menus.
3872000	3874000	Stealing is bad, UK.
3874000	3877000	That is right. That is the exact same song, isn't it?
3877000	3881000	So anyway, they were kind of called out on this on Twitter.
3881000	3885000	And by the way, that game I just mentioned, the Madara game, that was actually a Konami game.
3885000	3888000	So just funny kind of aside. But anyway.
3888000	3891000	And as we like to say, Konami will sue.
3891000	3899000	Well, not this time. Anyway, Cubic Games acknowledged the situation and says they were unaware that the music was stolen.
3899000	3903000	They basically said that they thought the track was original work.
3903000	3905000	They paid a composer for the music.
3905000	3910000	So maybe the composer bait and switched them. Who knows?
3910000	3914000	Yeah. Dungeon Buster in chat says, hey, this game is so obscure, no one will figure it out.
3914000	3916000	Internet accepts challenge.
3916000	3922000	Dude, don't. If you think you're going to pull a fast one by stealing from some obscure NES game,
3922000	3930000	you're not going to get away with it because there's people out there that love, love 8-bit games that no one else loves.
3930000	3932000	I mean, look at us in the Guardian Legend.
3932000	3936000	Now, granted, that's a little bit more mainstream of a cult title.
3936000	3939000	I think a lot more gamers have heard of that particular game.
3939000	3941000	But there's a lot of gamers that haven't.
3941000	3944000	But I would not try to steal a song from the Guardian Legend and be like, oh, this game's so old.
3944000	3946000	Nobody heard of it. Nobody played it.
3946000	3948000	Because you know what? There's a lot of people that would recognize it like that.
3948000	3951000	Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. Like you would know that.
3951000	3957000	So just to be clear here, because I'm not aware that he does music production on the side,
3957000	3962000	but the music producer wasn't, you know, Philip Musen, was it?
3962000	3964000	What's that?
3964000	3966000	Philip Musen?
3966000	3971000	No. Oh, God. Oh, no. I don't believe it was that whole thing.
3971000	3974000	Just making sure he doesn't do music production on the side.
3974000	3975000	Yes.
3975000	3977000	With his totally original work.
3977000	3981000	All right. Oh, my gosh.
3981000	3985000	So, by the way, I got distracted there for a minute because Alan just texted me the instructions.
3985000	3988000	Oh, by the way, you need to feed Mr. Smusher. He's going to scream his head off all night.
3988000	3989000	Oh, thanks.
3989000	3990000	You don't say.
3990000	3993000	You don't say. Thanks. Thanks for doing that before you left. All right. That's all right.
3993000	3995000	Animal needs food.
3995000	3999000	Here's the other thing. He's actually going to a movie tonight. He's going to see Halloween.
3999000	4002000	He found a friend that will go see scary movies with him, so I don't have to.
4002000	4004000	So that's good news.
4004000	4006000	Are you eh?
4006000	4008000	I don't know. The Halloween series is like, OK.
4008000	4010000	I hear the new one's all right.
4010000	4014000	Like, if you're a fan of those type of movies, I hear this new one's pretty good.
4014000	4016000	Yeah, but I'm just not I don't you know, I don't like gore.
4016000	4020000	And, you know, Michael Myers going to chop somebody's head off and I don't see it.
4020000	4024000	And even that trailer, he was like the teeth were falling. I was like, no, no.
4024000	4026000	Oh, no.
4026000	4027000	All right.
4027000	4028000	Yeah.
4028000	4030000	No, Mr. Smoosh is not going to a movie.
4030000	4031000	Yes, you and her.
4031000	4033000	Alan is going to a movie.
4033000	4037000	All right. Anyhow, Mr. Smoosh goes to the movies.
4037000	4043000	The brand new theatrical release coming this fall to theaters near you.
4044000	4050000	Maybe, maybe we'll give him a Twitch channel where he just sits there and watches movies, but he won't just sit there and do anything.
4050000	4052000	That's the that's the joke.
4052000	4055000	All right. Anyhow, already the chat room's lighting up.
4055000	4058000	I listen to that podcast.
4058000	4059000	All right.
4059000	4066000	Let's go back to a classic time when we did not we did not stream cats watching movies on the Internet.
4066000	4073000	We we instead spent lots and lots and lots of money on things to play one particular game.
4073000	4077000	Let's get to it with this throwback classic game of the week.
4077000	4088000	And so we take a step into the gaming vaults, a journey back through space and time to visit with Dark Sakura, who's here in the house.
4088000	4089000	Thanks to Radio Magic.
4089000	4091000	Thanks to me going to the thrift store.
4091000	4092000	That's right.
4092000	4094000	Did you find anything thrifty at the thrift store?
4094000	4096000	I don't laugh. I've always wanted an egg cobbler.
4096000	4098000	You know what those are?
4098000	4100000	Are those like the little things that hold porcelain?
4100000	4101000	I think I know.
4101000	4102000	And they have a screw top on them?
4102000	4103000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4103000	4107000	I've wanted one and they're like twenty five bucks for a good porcelain one if I wanted a thrift store for two bucks.
4107000	4108000	The classic cookware of the week.
4108000	4109000	Classic cookware.
4109000	4112000	I wanted an egg cobbler because I like coddled eggs.
4112000	4113000	There you go. All right.
4113000	4115000	Just told me not to coddle them too much and they'll get mouthy.
4115000	4116000	All right.
4116000	4121000	It's the classic game of the week, but actually once a month, Dark Sakura decides, you know what?
4121000	4125000	I'm going to do a peripheral because there's tons of like neat shit that came out for gaming.
4125000	4127000	Except now I'm like that little girl with the meme.
4127000	4128000	Why can't we do both?
4128000	4130000	That's right porque no los dos.
4130000	4131000	Right now.
4131000	4133000	So so the classic peripheral was not good enough for you.
4133000	4135000	You're going to do a peripheral and a game.
4135000	4137000	Because these two you can't do one without the other.
4137000	4139000	They are peas in a pod.
4139000	4140000	So let's stop making the audience wait.
4140000	4142000	What is the classic peripheral?
4142000	4143000	I guess technically.
4143000	4145000	So you get one a month but slash game of the month.
4145000	4150000	It's Steel Battalion also known in Japan.
4150000	4156000	And this is a game and and the peripheral I can't make words happen.
4156000	4165000	It was developed by Capcom for the Xbox and you control a vertical tank, which is bipedal mecha kind of think metal gear.
4165000	4169000	But yeah, I actually think metal gear.
4169000	4173000	It required this massive controller to play it.
4173000	4179000	The controller itself has two control sticks and 40 about 40 buttons.
4179000	4183000	They only came out in limited quantities and then they sold out.
4183000	4189000	I got an original one for Dan and they did do a rerelease, but it has blue buttons instead of green buttons.
4189000	4195000	So that's all you can tell which one you had, which by the way, now I looked on eBay to see what they're going for.
4195000	4201000	And while the whole set was about 200 bones together, they're going like 700 plus.
4201000	4202000	Oh, yeah.
4202000	4205000	I mean, it's not like they make these controllers anymore.
4205000	4206000	And it was big.
4206000	4211000	I mean, this thing like would fit on a desk and it came in three pieces.
4211000	4214000	And this was an event.
4214000	4216000	It was an experience.
4216000	4219000	If you bought one of these, you were you were going to have an event.
4219000	4224000	Yeah. And they did actually make like some mods for it where you could like make it smaller.
4224000	4230000	And then there were some I think people who did like aftermarket versions that were kind of OK.
4230000	4240000	But at any rate, this is where the game part comes into it with this controller, is that it was supposed to be like this immersive.
4240000	4249000	Like well, like you were saying, an event where you are in the cockpit and you were fully immersed in the gameplay through this.
4249000	4257000	At the start of every mission, you had to start up your mecha, which well, not just the mecha, but its operating system as well,
4257000	4261000	which was done through a different series of switches and buttons that were just for that.
4261000	4267000	And if you like turn corners too quickly, you fall over.
4267000	4271000	If your machine overheats, you have to reset your operating system.
4271000	4273000	You have window wipers.
4273000	4276000	So if you get hit by mud, it wipes them off.
4276000	4283000	And the other thing, too, is that if you don't hit your eject button when your mecha is about to go boom, you die with it.
4283000	4286000	And if you die, your save game gets deleted.
4286000	4288000	And you have to start the fuck over.
4288000	4289000	No!
4289000	4290000	Yes.
4290000	4291000	Oh my God, that eject button.
4291000	4297000	So I remember one of my earliest memories of meeting you and Dan was that you had this brick in your house.
4297000	4299000	And I was fascinated by the eject button.
4299000	4302000	I'm like, why do they need an eject button in a game?
4302000	4303000	This was serious business.
4303000	4306000	This was the Dark Souls of mech games.
4306000	4309000	The Dark Souls of peripheral movement.
4310000	4315000	Well, if you didn't hit that eject button, say goodbye to all that hard work.
4315000	4317000	Rob, imagine in Diablo.
4317000	4319000	I know, I'd cry.
4319000	4320000	I'd cry.
4320000	4325000	As much as I love Diablo, I think that's one of those things that I like the way it's better in Path of Exile.
4325000	4329000	If you play hardcore mode and your character dies, you simply, it drops to regular.
4329000	4331000	You just lose your hardcore mode status.
4331000	4333000	So I like that better.
4333000	4334000	Can you get it back?
4334000	4335000	Nope.
4335000	4339000	I mean, as frustrating as it is, it's like you didn't completely lose your character, you know what I mean?
4339000	4340000	Yeah.
4340000	4341000	Anyway.
4341000	4348000	Well, at any rate, as I said earlier, the vertical tanks, or VTs, are like giant metal gear things.
4348000	4350000	They walk on two legs, they shoot shit.
4350000	4352000	You have different types of combat roles.
4352000	4356000	You have assault, support, scout, and fast attack.
4356000	4360000	And then you have three weight classes, which is like medium and heavy.
4360000	4363000	And so as you progress through the game, you can get different tanks.
4363000	4368000	Now, the group that developed this at Capcom, it was Capcom Production Studio 4,
4368000	4371000	and they worked with some of the designers from Human Entertainment.
4371000	4377000	And that it was basically focused on the product.
4377000	4382000	They wanted to create a new peripheral and software designed to go with the peripheral.
4382000	4387000	So really, in this case, the peripheral came first, and the game followed.
4387000	4392000	And it actually did, you know, the project grew while they were working on it.
4392000	4397000	And the game was originally, well, the earliest build-up, it ran on PlayStation 2.
4397000	4402000	But when the Xbox came out, they were like, oh, this thing's a little bit more hardcore, so they did it.
4402000	4404000	They were going to do online play.
4404000	4406000	They took it out because they thought it would be too ambitious.
4406000	4409000	And they really didn't turn a whole lot of profit on this.
4409000	4412000	They did make a profit on it, just not a whole lot.
4412000	4421000	But Inaba, that's Inaba Atsushi, was the producer on it.
4421000	4424000	And he said that the point of it wasn't for profit,
4424000	4429000	but it was to show what could be done in the game industry that cannot be done in others.
4429000	4434000	As for ratings, Metacritic gave it an 83 out of 100.
4434000	4437000	Famitsu gave it 35 out of 40.
4437000	4441000	It got really, really good reviews for the most part.
4441000	4446000	Some were not so stellar, like Eurogamer and Edge gave it 6 out of 10.
4446000	4448000	But who cares what they think?
4448000	4449000	Who cares what they think?
4449000	4454000	I think that's notable, though, that a Japanese magazine like Famitsu enjoyed an Xbox game.
4454000	4456000	You don't hear these stories anymore.
4456000	4459000	Yeah, well, one of the...
4459000	4460000	I guess it was Capcom's game.
4460000	4462000	It was Retro Core, I think.
4462000	4466000	The guy who does the Battle of the Ports that I'm so fond of
4466000	4472000	was talking about how he had to go special order his Xbox One in Japan.
4472000	4473000	Yeah.
4473000	4476000	But there's a reviewer from IGN.
4476000	4477000	I really like this quote.
4477000	4478000	It's like,
4488000	4489000	Accurate.
4489000	4491000	Hello, AOL.
4491000	4499000	Anyway, there were some issues playing on consoles that use the executor mod chip.
4500000	4505000	The ignition button would trigger the console reset function of the mod chip
4505000	4510000	so you couldn't start your VT because you would just reset your system.
4510000	4514000	So it can be avoided by pushing fully forward on the right aiming lever
4514000	4518000	and pressing the ignition key or disabling the mod chip before playing.
4518000	4519000	So there were sequels.
4519000	4521000	There's still Battalion, Line of Contact.
4521000	4523000	And it also used the same controller.
4523000	4524000	That came out in 2004.
4524000	4526000	By the way, this was 2002, I forgot to say.
4526000	4529000	The third installment was still Battalion Heavy Armor.
4529000	4534000	And it used the Kinect instead of the original controller,
4534000	4535000	which is pretty stupid.
4535000	4538000	If you buy this controller, you should have more games than this.
4538000	4541000	That's quite economical to use the Kinect instead,
4541000	4544000	but probably not quite as impressive.
4544000	4546000	I always just thought the Japanese name was cool.
4546000	4549000	Tekki, it just sounds cool to say.
4549000	4550000	Yeah.
4550000	4551000	Plus I like the box.
4551000	4555000	I think actually even the U.S. box is stamped with it, with the kanji.
4556000	4560000	So that's really, that's really it.
4560000	4563000	The game 2002, still Battalion by Capcom.
4563000	4566000	But of course, the controller came first.
4566000	4568000	So you cannot talk about the controller without talking about the game.
4568000	4569000	Absolutely.
4569000	4573000	So there it is, your peripheral of the month slash game of the week,
4573000	4578000	Steel Battalion, another fine choice by Dark Sakura.
4578000	4581000	This motion sick inducing like, oh, get out.
4581000	4583000	Real quick before we get back to the show,
4583000	4585000	since, you know, we don't get to have you in studio, sad face,
4585000	4587000	outside of these special segments.
4587000	4588000	Only a few more months.
4588000	4590000	Any exciting Halloween plans?
4590000	4591000	I'm working.
4591000	4594000	Oh, that's, that's really crappy. Sorry to hear it.
4594000	4596000	Well, I might see if I can, if I can get out.
4596000	4599000	Cause that's a couple of weeks.
4599000	4603000	I'm actually getting out early on Friday and not Friday on Friday.
4603000	4610000	I already have Fridays off on Wednesday so that I can make truffle bread.
4610000	4612000	But I have to go on the way home.
4612000	4619000	I have to stop by Joanne's and get black food dye.
4619000	4621000	Oh, to make scary food.
4621000	4622000	To make scary food.
4622000	4626000	Cause I'm not putting activated charcoal in it like a lot of these recipes call for.
4626000	4629000	Because people might not be aware of this,
4629000	4632000	but activated charcoal, since it's supposed to absorb,
4632000	4634000	like legit absorb toxins out of your body.
4634000	4637000	Like not in that, oh, I'm getting a detox kind of way.
4637000	4640000	But it's what they give you when you have poisoned yourself.
4640000	4643000	It also will absorb your vitamins. It will absorb your drugs,
4643000	4647000	which if someone at my work is on drugs that keep them alive,
4647000	4650000	I'm not going to be responsible for inhibiting that.
4650000	4653000	Wasn't the charcoal stuff the stuff that like they put in the Burger King burger
4653000	4656000	that was black that made everybody's poop turn blue or something like that?
4656000	4659000	I want to try the Burger King one that's green. It's got a green bun.
4659000	4660000	No, no thanks. No thanks.
4660000	4663000	I mean, I don't really like Burger King. I like their onion rings,
4663000	4666000	but I want to just eat the green burger so I can send a picture to my mother.
4666000	4671000	Although I did send her a wonderful picture today of a Liberace 8-track.
4671000	4673000	Oh, beautiful. Oh, at a thrift store, of course.
4673000	4674000	At a thrift store.
4674000	4675000	Quintessential thrift store item.
4675000	4676000	I almost bought it. I was going to make a wallet out of it,
4676000	4678000	but I was like, I'm just going to sit there going,
4678000	4681000	hi, I'm Liberace. I'm very gay and very dead.
4681000	4683000	All right. We need to go back through the portal to the present time.
4683000	4686000	But any final thoughts for our listeners for this week?
4686000	4690000	I'm playing Pokemon Go. I'm playing a lot of Pokemon Go.
4690000	4693000	A lot. And I got robbed Tim Tams.
4697000	4700000	And the Tim Tams were delicious, I'll have you know.
4700000	4705000	Anyway, thank you very much Dark Sakura for the walk down memory lane with Steel Battalion.
4705000	4709000	And that, again, is like an early memory I have of going to Dark Sakura's place
4709000	4712000	and actually seeing that massive display.
4712000	4715000	Loki, you remember the Steel Battalion controller and seeing that whole thing?
4715000	4716000	That thing was amazing.
4716000	4717000	I remember it, yes.
4717000	4719000	Yeah. Aren't you a big mech game fan?
4719000	4720000	Eh.
4720000	4721000	I thought you were kind of dizzy.
4721000	4722000	I didn't want to play Steel Battalion, though.
4722000	4723000	Oh, okay. Not that one.
4724000	4726000	You want that one game to come back.
4726000	4728000	What was that Sega game they put on 360 you really liked?
4728000	4729000	It was a mech game.
4729000	4732000	Oh, Virtualon? That's all right. That is coming back.
4732000	4734000	Oh, well, I guess we'll get into that later, won't we?
4734000	4735000	We will, yes.
4735000	4736000	All right.
4736000	4738000	No, the one I used to play a lot was the Battletech.
4738000	4740000	The Virtual World Battletech games.
4740000	4741000	Yeah.
4741000	4744000	Oh, are those the ones that were at the Dave and Busters?
4744000	4745000	You go in the pods.
4745000	4749000	Okay, so the ones that they still, like they still bring those basically like Dragon Combat.
4749000	4752000	They're rebranded now and there's a whole, Bobby did a whole show on it years ago.
4752000	4753000	Yeah.
4753000	4756000	Yeah, so like you kind of, the spirit of the whole thing lives on, but yeah.
4756000	4758000	But you don't ever go to Dragon Combat.
4758000	4760000	Man, if they updated those games, that'd be sweet.
4760000	4761000	You never know. You never know.
4761000	4764000	All right, let's move on. We got some rapid fire news to get into.
4764000	4765000	Loki, starting with you.
4765000	4767000	All right, so this is kind of cool.
4767000	4773000	You know, there's, of course, always new backwards compatible games on Xbox One.
4773000	4778000	Well, if you happen to have the Half-Life 2, the Orange Box Collection,
4778000	4784000	then those games are going to be enhanced and backwards compatible with Xbox One as well.
4784000	4792000	So you can find the X, yeah, the Portal still live, Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2.
4792000	4798000	Those are all going to have enhanced visuals on the Xbox One X,
4798000	4805000	as well as the Half-Life 2 Episode 2 Team Fortress Portal and Episode 1 as well.
4805000	4809000	And I think the original Half-Life, which were all part of the Orange Box.
4809000	4811000	So that's neat.
4811000	4815000	Along with that, there's also other enhanced titles as well.
4815000	4820000	Including, you know, Crackdown, Assassin's Creed, and Red Dead Redemption.
4820000	4822000	I believe those are all the older ones, so.
4822000	4827000	I still need to get my copy of the Orange Box in the Xbox One X and check that out.
4827000	4830000	I mean, that was a great, that Orange Box, if I remember right,
4830000	4833000	that was a previous OLR game of the year, the year that came out.
4833000	4835000	And that's just because we're both feeling orange.
4835000	4836000	It was a great value.
4836000	4837000	Yeah, it was an amazing value for games.
4837000	4840000	I wish they would do that again, but they don't have enough games to put in a collection.
4840000	4843000	The 3 Box, that's what we want, the 3 Box.
4843000	4847000	Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3, Half-Life 3.
4847000	4849000	That's right, the 3 Box.
4849000	4852000	Do you know how many, oh my god, do you know, like, everybody would just,
4852000	4853000	like all the gamers out there would just want to take a bus.
4853000	4854000	Dota 3.
4854000	4855000	Ahhh!
4855000	4856000	Bleh!
4856000	4858000	Okay, anyway.
4858000	4859000	Never going to fucking happen.
4859000	4862000	I know, let a man dream.
4862000	4863000	Alright.
4863000	4868000	And then, of course, unfortunately, as with most things, there's going to be delays.
4868000	4873000	And Days Gone, one of the games that they showed off, at least the last few E3s.
4873000	4877000	I spent a lot of time on it two E3s ago, I think.
4877000	4879000	Yes, they have delayed it again.
4879000	4883000	So now, it was originally going to be slated for February 22nd.
4883000	4886000	Now it's coming out April 26th, 2019.
4886000	4891000	And of course, as the usual goes, we've recently decided to move the release
4891000	4896000	of Days Gone from the crowded February timeframe to April 26th, 2019.
4896000	4900000	While the studio's eager to see Days Gone in the hands of fans,
4900000	4903000	Ben's studio will take the opportunity to further polish Days Gone.
4903000	4905000	More polish, spit shine, you know.
4905000	4910000	The game was not ready to go gold, so we're going to need a little more time.
4910000	4911000	Take the time.
4911000	4914000	Alright, take the time to get it right, especially with something that,
4914000	4917000	you know, you've shined a very, very bright, big spotlight on
4917000	4919000	in a game you want to perform very well.
4919000	4922000	I think many of us have a different way of thinking in this day and age
4922000	4925000	where, you know what, if they had to delay it to get it right, then so be it.
4925000	4928000	Something you could play on your PlayStation 4 in the meantime
4928000	4931000	while you're waiting for that is you could play Dream Daddy.
4931000	4932000	That's right, Dream Daddy.
4932000	4934000	Which, funny enough, I still haven't really played Dream Daddy.
4934000	4937000	I'm aware of Dream Daddy and I've seen some of it on Twitch and stuff.
4937000	4939000	I have not played the game myself.
4939000	4943000	Maybe that's something I need to fix because there is a Dad Director's Cut,
4943000	4946000	which I think is like Dada, but Dad Director's Cut,
4946000	4949000	which is coming out for the PlayStation 4.
4949000	4953000	And what's nice about this is that because it was originally out on the PC,
4953000	4958000	the PC version will get upgraded to the Dad Director's Cut for free,
4958000	4959000	so that's pretty cool.
4959000	4962000	So anyhow, if you don't know what Dream Daddy is,
4962000	4965000	it is a hunky dad dating simulator,
4965000	4970000	and that's kind of neat that it's coming out on PlayStation 4.
4970000	4972000	It's a little more mainstream by doing that.
4972000	4975000	My question is, has anyone cosplayed these characters?
4975000	4976000	I did.
4976000	4977000	Oh, that's right, you did. I forgot.
4977000	4978000	Yeah, I did.
4978000	4979000	I forgot, yeah.
4979000	4983000	And I swear, only one group of people knew who I was
4983000	4987000	because I walked by these guys and you know one of them let out the,
4987000	4990000	yeah, Dream Daddy.
4990000	4992000	And that's how I knew I was recognized.
4992000	4993000	I think his name was Brian.
4993000	4995000	It was the guy with the tank top and the corgi,
4995000	4997000	and I had a little stuffed corgi and I wore the green.
4997000	4999000	I did the whole thing because he had a beard too, like I do,
4999000	5001000	so I was like, I don't want to shave my beard,
5001000	5003000	so I found a character that I could do that.
5003000	5006000	And yeah, one person got it, so that's all right.
5006000	5010000	Anyhow, let's see, in chat over at live.vognetwork.com,
5010000	5014000	Rama in chat says, I know a few girls who did Dream Daddy crossplays.
5014000	5016000	Why not? Why not?
5016000	5020000	All right, but do people get it without having to have it explained to them?
5020000	5023000	That's when I really enjoy the outfit.
5023000	5026000	And even the ones that like blend things, you know,
5026000	5030000	like Deadpool but in the old Marriott carpet,
5030000	5032000	that's like stuff that you don't have to explain.
5032000	5034000	It's funny. Anyway.
5034000	5038000	The director's cut of Dream Daddy will come out on October 30th
5038000	5040000	for the PlayStation 4. What's new?
5040000	5043000	There's a new jogging minigame, more side quests,
5043000	5047000	and other content that was previously cut, so you can check that out.
5047000	5051000	Moving on to news about Rocket League.
5051000	5053000	We know that Rocket League is going to be getting crossplay soon,
5053000	5054000	but not that soon.
5054000	5058000	The developers of the game are saying that it's going to be coming out in 2019.
5058000	5061000	The goal was to release Rocket ID before the end of 2018.
5061000	5062000	The studio said.
5062000	5066000	But we've made the difficult decision to put this release into early 2019.
5066000	5069000	The good news is that with Sony's recent announcements
5069000	5071000	regarding full cross-form functionality,
5071000	5075000	we can now make additional changes to prepare Rocket ID for all platforms
5075000	5077000	should we receive the permission to do so.
5077000	5080000	This is not a delay because of Sony.
5080000	5082000	They are making that pretty clear.
5082000	5085000	I guess this is just, you know, since they have to kind of set up this whole Rocket ID
5085000	5087000	and the whole other thing that they're going to do.
5087000	5090000	But that is kind of neat that you'll be able to play cross-platform.
5090000	5095000	And I assume if I have it on Steam and I have it on PlayStation 4
5095000	5098000	and I have it on Switch, which I do have it on all those platforms,
5098000	5101000	I'll have one ID to have all my data across all those platforms,
5101000	5102000	which is pretty cool.
5102000	5103000	Yes.
5103000	5104000	That's very cool.
5104000	5105000	All right.
5105000	5107000	Let's check out what is in stores this week,
5107000	5110000	what types of releases we have for games this week.
5110000	5112000	We're starting to get into a busy time of year, right, Logie?
5112000	5114000	Yeah, well, yeah, we've already been there.
5114000	5116000	We're still there.
5116000	5119000	Bass Pro Shops to Strike Championship Edition coming out on the Switch.
5119000	5123000	Cavella's The Hunt Championship Edition on the Switch as well.
5123000	5130000	Just Dance 2019 on the Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox 360, Wii U,
5130000	5134000	and the Wii, the original Wii, still getting games.
5134000	5139000	Nickelodeon Kart Racers on the Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5139000	5145000	Paw Patrol on a Roll for PC, the Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

5174000	5176000	and Xbox One.
5176000	5180000	And last but not least, Red Dead Redemption 2 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5180000	5182000	No PC, boo.
5182000	5184000	All right.
5184000	5187000	Well, traveling to Japan to check out the releases over there this week.
5187000	5191000	You know, the only big one that I'm seeing here on the 26th
5191000	5195000	is we have the Red Dead Redemption 2 also coming out in Japan.
5195000	5198000	I don't think I see any other Japanese releases.
5198000	5200000	Oh, no, there they are. They're there on the 25th.
5200000	5202000	That's why they're on different day.
5202000	5204000	I don't know many of these games, but...
5204000	5206000	Oh, no, this one. This is the big one on PlayStation 4.
5206000	5209000	Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection International.
5209000	5211000	Remember how they bumped it back a little bit for Japan?
5211000	5214000	Yeah, to fix some things and make it appropriate?
5214000	5216000	That is finally out on the PlayStation 4 this week in Japan.
5216000	5218000	So that's out on the 25th.
5218000	5220000	That's why it took me a minute to find because it's the day before Red Dead.
5220000	5222000	Some other releases in Japan.
5222000	5224000	LEGO DC Super-Villains gets its Japanese release.
5224000	5228000	A game called Sakura Sakura, no relation to Dark Sakura, is also out.
5229000	5234000	And then Noratu Ojuu To Norinako Heart in Premium and Limited Edition.
5234000	5236000	That is also out in Japan this week.
5236000	5238000	That is all on the PlayStation 4.
5238000	5240000	Checking out the Nintendo Switch this week.
5240000	5242000	That same Street Fighter collection also on the Switch,
5242000	5245000	as well as Beyblade Burst Battle Zero,
5245000	5247000	and LEGO DC Super-Villains also on the Switch this week,
5247000	5250000	as well as the Noratu Ojuu To Norinako Heart,
5250000	5252000	which I had previously mentioned.
5252000	5255000	And I believe that is it for Japan.
5255000	5257000	Checking out to see the Vita, actually.
5257000	5259000	That Sakura Sakura is also out on the Vita this week
5259000	5261000	in a regular and limited edition,
5261000	5263000	even though we know the Vita is on its way out.
5263000	5266000	Hey, in Japan, there's still a party going on.
5266000	5270000	So, Loki, would you mind covering the UK while Jamie is still out?
5270000	5273000	Yep. Some different stuff coming out in the UK.
5273000	5277000	So we've got Spin Tires Mud Runner, American Wilds Edition.
5277000	5280000	That's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5280000	5285000	Red Dead Redemption 2 also coming out as well on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5285000	5288000	Dragon Ball Xenoverse and Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2.
5288000	5291000	Looks like a combo pack there for PlayStation 4.
5291000	5295000	And Dragon Ball FighterZ and Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2.
5295000	5299000	They're also doing another combo pack as well on PlayStation 4.
5299000	5306000	PAW Patrol on a roll on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and 3DS.
5306000	5310000	And last but not least, a game that my son's really interested in.
5310000	5313000	Bendy and the Ink Machine.
5313000	5316000	That's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One over there.
5316000	5318000	Which one's that? I don't know much about that.
5318000	5322000	It's like a survivor horror game,
5322000	5327000	but it's, imagine like old school Mickey Mouse,
5327000	5329000	but it's not Mickey Mouse.
5329000	5332000	Kind of like, it reminds me a little bit like Epic Mickey,
5332000	5335000	where they had, I mean, I guess that's technically still Mickey characters.
5335000	5337000	They're knockoff Mickey characters.
5337000	5340000	It's not Mickey Mouse and not Goofy,
5340000	5343000	but it's like horrible shit that happens and it's a scary game.
5345000	5347000	And of course, actually a few more games here.
5347000	5351000	We've got Rapala Fishing Pro Series on the Switch,
5351000	5354000	Chicken Range on PlayStation 4 and the Switch,
5354000	5358000	Just Dance 2019, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch,
5358000	5362000	Nickelodeon Kart Racers on PlayStation 4,
5362000	5364000	Xbox One and the Switch,
5364000	5366000	and what has Ninja Turtles in there?
5366000	5369000	Rugrats and SpongeBob and...
5370000	5372000	The only way I'd get that game is if it has Zim.
5372000	5374000	I can't really tell from the box art there.
5375000	5378000	Probably not, unfortunately.
5380000	5382000	Whatever. Hey Arnold's in there though.
5383000	5385000	Hey Arnold, hell yeah.
5385000	5387000	Alright, let's move on and get to...
5387000	5389000	I'm sorry I'm laughing,
5389000	5391000	because it's probably not picking up on the microphones,
5391000	5393000	but, so I full on fed Smoosh during the break.
5393000	5395000	Guess what? Guess what? He's back now.
5395000	5397000	Screaming again. I'm back bitches.
5397000	5399000	I'm back to scream for more. What's he want?
5399000	5401000	Is this supposed to be a limitless supply of food?
5401000	5402000	What a fat ass.
5402000	5404000	Feed me more.
5404000	5406000	Alright, let's get to the mailbag.
5410000	5412000	Every week you guys email us,
5412000	5414000	participate at orangeloungeradio.com
5414000	5417000	and we take your emails and we read them here on the show.
5417000	5419000	We didn't get a lot of emails,
5419000	5422000	just one email in two parts is what we got this week,
5422000	5424000	so we'll read it.
5424000	5426000	It's from our old pal Robert M who emails us a lot,
5426000	5428000	and I will always read Robert M emails,
5428000	5430000	especially when none of the rest of you are emailing,
5430000	5431000	so here we go.
5431000	5432000	Robert M says,
5432000	5436000	I still don't know when I'll get the chance to be in a party group to play,
5436000	5439000	but I do see that in spite of my original email saying the service
5439000	5442000	was only showing the Windows and Steam OS Linux versions,
5442000	5446000	the Mac version of Jackbox Party Pack 5 is in fact on sale on Steam,
5446000	5448000	and other services as well.
5448000	5451000	I do see the Switch store sales generally line up pretty well with Steam sales.
5451000	5454000	I'm guessing PlayStation and Xbox do as well.
5454000	5457000	There you go, that's the first part from Robert M.
5457000	5460000	So first off, I forgot that Jackbox Party Pack 5 came out.
5460000	5462000	I need to pick that up.
5462000	5464000	I guess that was just this past week.
5464000	5466000	Only had friends, and I totally play that.
5466000	5469000	But then really kind of getting to the second part of the question
5469000	5472000	about the sales generally lining up,
5472000	5475000	usually because the publisher may choose to do a sale.
5475000	5477000	Let's say in this case,
5478000	5481000	Jackbox Games themselves decides to do a sale,
5481000	5485000	they will probably do kind of a similar thing across all platforms.
5485000	5488000	In fact, some distribution ends,
5488000	5490000	like I think Amazon was notorious for this.
5490000	5492000	I don't know if this is still the rule with Amazon,
5492000	5494000	but Amazon's thing was always like,
5494000	5496000	if your product goes on sale anywhere else,
5496000	5499000	you will have to lower the price here too.
5499000	5502000	Like you cannot have a sale somewhere else
5502000	5505000	that isn't matched on Amazon basically,
5505000	5509000	and that's part of the way that they fight for the low prices.
5510000	5513000	Not that Amazon is usually known for game sales,
5513000	5515000	but I guess they do sell, I mean,
5515000	5517000	I should say, let me choose my words carefully,
5517000	5519000	digital game sales.
5519000	5521000	I know they do offer it,
5521000	5523000	but I always thought I liked the physical stuff.
5523000	5525000	But I haven't bought a game on Amazon ever since
5525000	5530000	I got rid of the discount for the Amazon Prime.
5530000	5533000	Last game I bought was Final Fantasy XI.
5533000	5537000	Again, it was like another copy because I wanted another.
5538000	5541000	Bobby in chat says there was a Humble Bundle with the first three packs
5541000	5543000	and even some of the earlier You Don't Know Jax.
5543000	5544000	Yeah, I remember that one.
5544000	5546000	So like a charity thing, of course,
5546000	5549000	since it was through the Humble Bundle.
5549000	5551000	There's a second part to the email from Robert M.
5551000	5553000	who says, sorry for the addendum,
5553000	5556000	but Cuphead was just released for Mac yesterday.
5556000	5558000	It runs wonderfully on my old MacBook.
5558000	5560000	That is all from Robert M.
5560000	5562000	Oh, yes, Cuphead, still a game worth looking at.
5562000	5566000	Great bullet hell game with a really nice twist on it
5566000	5568000	with the whole, like, 30s cartoon stuff.
5568000	5571000	It's a fantastic game worth your time
5571000	5572000	if you haven't checked it out.
5572000	5574000	My seal of approval. There you go.
5574000	5577000	Again, participate at OrangeLawnTrady.com
5577000	5578000	is the place to send an email
5578000	5580000	if you want to send us an email for a future week.
5580000	5581000	So there you go.
5581000	5583000	Loki, what do you have for us?
5583000	5584000	All right.
5584000	5587000	Well, let's talk a little bit about a game that I alluded to earlier
5587000	5588000	when we were talking about mech games,
5588000	5591000	and that would be Sega's Virtual On.
5591000	5595000	So recently we just had a Virtual On.
5595000	5596000	What was it?
5596000	5600000	It was a certain magical Virtual On,
5600000	5602000	which was, I think, like a spinoff.
5602000	5607000	But now the actual Cybertroopers Virtual On
5607000	5611000	and also I believe the, was it Cybertroopers Virtual On
5611000	5615000	or a Torrio Tangrim
5615000	5618000	and then Virtual On Force.
5618000	5620000	Those are going to be released as well.
5620000	5625000	This is coming out now with this also crowdfunded arcade stick
5625000	5627000	that they had for Virtual On.
5627000	5631000	So you can get that with the Tenita twin stick controller,
5631000	5634000	which looks goddamn massive.
5634000	5636000	But the twin sticks were awesome.
5636000	5639000	That's what made the game fun.
5639000	5643000	No idea how much that is, but looks pretty massive.
5643000	5647000	The game itself, though, is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4.
5647000	5652000	So we'll have to wait and see what the availability of those are as well.
5652000	5654000	I mean, God.
5654000	5657000	Neat.
5657000	5660000	Are you excited it's coming back?
5660000	5662000	I am. I think it's cool.
5662000	5665000	I wouldn't necessarily spend money on giant controllers
5665000	5668000	just for, you know, a couple games,
5668000	5672000	but it's neat that they're doing that.
5672000	5675000	That sounds like something that maybe Jamie and Dan might be into,
5675000	5677000	but I don't know.
5677000	5678000	I will have to ask her next time.
5678000	5680000	Actually, Jamie's going to be live in the studio next week,
5680000	5681000	so I'll have to ask her when she's here.
5681000	5683000	Yeah, so I was just trying to see real quick
5683000	5685000	what the actual sticks cost.
5685000	5687000	It went through like a crowdfunding thing.
5687000	5688000	Oh, here we go.
5688000	5689000	Ho, ho, ho.
5689000	5691000	No.
5691000	5693000	That's a big no.
5693000	5697000	So apparently...
5697000	5699000	Okay, okay, that's what their funding goal was.
5699000	5701000	I was like, is that the cost of the sticks?
5701000	5704000	Because I ain't buying it for that.
5704000	5706000	Let's see, so what was the actual cost here?
5706000	5709000	I've got to translate this because it's all in Japanese.
5713000	5714000	I don't think it says.
5714000	5715000	I think they were just raising money.
5715000	5716000	Okay, here we go.
5716000	5722000	So 55,400 yen would get you a twin stick controller.
5722000	5724000	Wow.
5724000	5727000	I don't know what that translates to.
5727000	5730000	I think if you want to be really quick and dirty,
5730000	5732000	100 yen is a dollar.
5732000	5734000	So $600?
5734000	5735000	Yeah.
5735000	5736000	No.
5736000	5738000	But that's a very quick answer.
5738000	5740000	Honestly, it's probably a little more generous than that.
5740000	5741000	But anyway.
5741000	5742000	No thanks.
5742000	5744000	Not worth it for me.
5744000	5746000	But, you know, it's cool that they're making it.
5746000	5748000	All right.
5748000	5750000	Let's move on and talk about something
5750000	5752000	they're not going to be making anymore, unfortunately.
5752000	5754000	These game magazines out of the UK.
5754000	5756000	So you wouldn't know them here in the States
5756000	5757000	unless you imported them.
5757000	5759000	But maybe some of our folks overseas
5759000	5761000	know Games Master and Games TM.
5761000	5763000	They have announced they are closing.
5763000	5765000	The publisher of the magazine, Future,
5765000	5767000	has said that both publications will be releasing
5767000	5769000	their final issues in November.
5769000	5772000	Games TM has been around since 2002.
5772000	5775000	Games Master goes all the way back to 1993
5775000	5777000	when it was released along a TV show
5777000	5780000	that had the exact same name that was on Channel 4.
5780000	5784000	Even when the Channel 4 show got cancelled in 1998,
5784000	5787000	the Games Master magazine was still running.
5787000	5789000	So Future, in a statement, said that these magazines
5789000	5791000	were no longer profitable parts of the business.
5791000	5793000	The decision was difficult,
5793000	5796000	but they're proud of the work, et cetera, et cetera.
5796000	5799000	Anyhow, there's other titles like Edge, PC Gamer,
5799000	5801000	and the official PlayStation and Xbox magazines.
5801000	5803000	Those are not expected to be affected,
5803000	5805000	but it's just, you know, magazines again.
5805000	5808000	The internet is kind of hurting all that.
5808000	5810000	It's instant, and magazines aren't.
5810000	5812000	Magazines are always kind of more collector's items
5812000	5813000	in the state of nature.
5813000	5815000	I don't even find, like, I get only one magazine now,
5815000	5817000	and that's Game Informer because I keep signing up
5817000	5820000	for their stupid discount thing over at GameStop occasionally.
5820000	5822000	And it's not because I actually sign up for it,
5822000	5824000	it's just because stuff I purchase,
5824000	5827000	and I always use my, you know, card with it.
5827000	5830000	It cruises points, and then the points pay for the membership,
5830000	5833000	so I don't really pay for it necessarily.
5833000	5836000	But, like, I honestly, I look at the magazine,
5836000	5839000	flip through it, like, very briefly, and I toss it aside.
5839000	5840000	I'm like, eh.
5840000	5844000	Although this month they had a thing about Dreams,
5844000	5847000	which is that new medium medical game, so that looks cool.
5847000	5851000	The more that I see of that, the more kind of hype I kind of get behind it,
5851000	5854000	but we haven't really heard too much about it.
5854000	5858000	Other than, like, they kind of had it, like, bits behind, you know,
5858000	5861000	like the transition stuff between things they were showing at, like,
5861000	5863000	I don't remember if it was the PlayStation event
5863000	5866000	or if it was the Sony press conference,
5866000	5868000	but they had, like, it as, like, a transition thing,
5868000	5870000	and they didn't really say much about it.
5870000	5873000	I think it was the last PSX because the E3 thing this year
5873000	5876000	was they went between the rooms and that whole thing, remember?
5876000	5878000	They started in the barn, yeah.
5878000	5881000	Yes, I remember and hate that.
5881000	5884000	Yeah, but it's probably something they won't be bringing back next year.
5884000	5886000	All right, let's move on. Loki.
5886000	5889000	All right, so this is unfortunate as well because, you know,
5889000	5894000	as much as I like games, I hate when things are removed from games,
5894000	5899000	and as we may have talked about when the PC version was coming out,
5899000	5904000	Senran Kongura Burst Renewal, which was delayed,
5904000	5909000	they were removing the intimacy mode from the port that was coming,
5909000	5910000	I think, the PC.
5910000	5912000	Well, now they're saying they're going to be removing it
5912000	5915000	from the PlayStation 4 version as well.
5915000	5919000	Basically, they're saying that the wishes of the platform holder
5919000	5921000	want it removed.
5921000	5927000	Intimacy mode, I'm assuming, was like a photo mode or something like that.
5927000	5931000	So, of course, you know, intimacy mode, you can dress up your characters
5931000	5937000	and grope them, so they wanted to remove that.
5937000	5940000	Apparently, they weren't happy with that being in the game.
5940000	5944000	Yeah, I feel like there's, you know, people out there
5944000	5946000	that would probably take a lot of issue to that,
5946000	5948000	especially with everything that's going on in the world.
5948000	5952000	It might not be the best time for a mode like that, I suppose.
5954000	5956000	There's people defending it, though,
5956000	5960000	saying, like, if you don't stand up for stuff you don't like,
5960000	5963000	when they come for the stuff you do like, you've already lost.
5963000	5965000	Oh, Jesus Christ.
5965000	5966000	Sit down.
5966000	5968000	There's more important things to worry about in the world
5968000	5970000	than your anime titties.
5970000	5972000	All right.
5972000	5974000	In fact, you know, it's really worrisome.
5974000	5977000	You know, it really gets the internet up in an uproar.
5977000	5978000	Puddles.
5978000	5982000	You remember with Superman, the new Superman game on PlayStation 4?
5982000	5983000	Spider-Man.
5983000	5984000	That's what I meant.
5984000	5987000	Spider-Man game on PlayStation 4, people were taking issue that,
5987000	5991000	oh my God, there's less puddles in the game than they were showing at E3.
5991000	5995000	Well, you know, there was a little bit of a tongue-in-cheek thing
5995000	5997000	that happened that Insomniac did
5997000	5999000	when they did an update to the game this week.
5999000	6002000	Now, they did a patch that did some, you know, useful game features
6002000	6005000	that people were looking for, like a new game plus mode,
6005000	6009000	and they also will have new items in the photo mode,
6009000	6012000	like stickers, frames, you know, the type of shit
6012000	6015000	that people do on their Instagrams and those type of, you know,
6015000	6017000	photo editing apps, Twitter even as well.
6017000	6020000	Well, one of the other stickers that they put in the game
6020000	6025000	is a cartoon puddle, and they actually did a tweet.
6025000	6028000	So there was a tweet that was put out by one of the guys there
6028000	6030000	that said, we have a new patch today.
6030000	6032000	Not only do we have a new game plus,
6032000	6035000	we have a bunch of stuff in photo mode, including stickers and frames,
6035000	6037000	and what's funny is they go back to that scene with the puddle,
6037000	6039000	and they put a bunch of new puddles with the stickers,
6039000	6041000	and he signed it with, I fixed this for you.
6041000	6042000	Happy face.
6042000	6044000	I love that.
6044000	6046000	What a sassy little bitch.
6046000	6048000	What a sassy bitch, I love it.
6048000	6050000	I love it.
6050000	6052000	Yes, hey dog, I heard you like puddles.
6052000	6056000	Our assistant, J100 Matt in chat says, puddles with puddles.
6056000	6058000	Puddle-ception.
6058000	6060000	Just a few more stories for you guys,
6060000	6062000	then we're going to get to your calls at Orange Lounge Radio,
6062000	6064000	all one word on Skype, but first, Loki.
6064000	6067000	So we talked a little bit about, I think it was a few weeks ago,
6067000	6072000	about Mario Kart and how they were receiving a cease and desist,
6072000	6077000	because they were operating a tour service that was in go-karts,
6077000	6080000	and they were dressed up like Mario Kart characters,
6080000	6082000	and Nintendo took issue with that,
6082000	6085000	because apparently they were colliding with cars and stuff like that,
6085000	6090000	and they didn't like the image that that was leaving.
6090000	6094000	Well, Mario Kart decided, hey, guess what, we don't give a fuck,
6094000	6098000	and they were going to continue doing business as usual,
6098000	6102000	despite having the cough of $90,000 in damages.
6102000	6106000	Apparently they're saying that right now they're going to be continuing their service
6106000	6112000	as it's appealing the ruling with the courts.
6112000	6115000	So, I don't know.
6115000	6118000	I don't know if you'd want to pick a fight with Nintendo,
6118000	6123000	but $90,000 seems like a pretty lax amount of money,
6123000	6124000	but now...
6124000	6127000	The man can't shut me down.
6127000	6129000	Yeah, so I don't know.
6129000	6132000	They know that they're holding a blue shell in their inventory right now.
6132000	6133000	I'd totally do it, though.
6133000	6137000	I would totally do a tour dressed up like Yoshi or Mario.
6137000	6139000	Oh, yeah, heck yeah. This sounds like a lot of fun.
6139000	6140000	Why not?
6140000	6142000	I think I mentioned this when the story first came up.
6142000	6145000	I went to that little racing place that isn't far from here one time.
6145000	6148000	An ex took me there a long time ago. It was my ex.
6148000	6152000	And we did that whole thing, and I was like, this is like playing Mario Kart,
6152000	6154000	but for real and without the red shells and green shells.
6154000	6155000	It was a lot of fun.
6155000	6157000	I kind of want to do that again sometime.
6157000	6159000	They need a totally like an AR.
6159000	6163000	I know they have the virtual, the VR Mario Kart,
6163000	6166000	but they need like an AR Mario Kart game of like...
6166000	6168000	Where you play with your real kart.
6168000	6170000	No, where you're actually in real go-karts and stuff,
6170000	6173000	and you hit a button or whatever that's on the steering wheel,
6173000	6175000	and then maybe they could have projectors or something that project.
6175000	6177000	Are you talking about like Mario Kart Arcade?
6177000	6180000	I'm talking about like an actual go-kart place or something.
6180000	6181000	You know, do like battle mode.
6181000	6183000	Oh, like, okay, okay.
6183000	6188000	Like maybe like you have a HUD that is on the windshield
6188000	6190000	or something that shows you like items and stuff.
6190000	6191000	Yeah.
6191000	6192000	That'd be silly.
6192000	6194000	I don't think they'd do it because it'd be too dangerous and hard to do,
6194000	6196000	but like, it'd be neat.
6196000	6197000	Yeah, it could be fun.
6197000	6198000	All right.
6198000	6201000	One more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line tonight,
6201000	6203000	and unfortunately, this is not so lighthearted.
6203000	6207000	It's pretty sad, but the co-founder of Microsoft, Paul Allen,
6207000	6209000	passed away this week at 65.
6209000	6214000	Now, I don't think Paul Allen really did a lot directly with the Xbox,
6214000	6218000	but certainly as he was one of the co-founders of Microsoft,
6218000	6222000	without him, we would not have the Xbox or any Xbox One, et cetera,
6222000	6225000	and PC gaming and all of that.
6225000	6228000	Microsoft has a huge responsibility and all that.
6228000	6230000	He did pass away at the age of 65.
6230000	6232000	That's really not old when you think about it.
6232000	6235000	He passed away from non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
6235000	6237000	He had been fighting various...
6237000	6240000	I mean, he had fought Hodgkin's lymphoma a while ago,
6240000	6243000	so unfortunately, yeah, he did pass in this past week.
6243000	6247000	There was a tweet from the current CEO of Microsoft
6247000	6251000	that said Paul Allen's contributions to our company and the community
6251000	6252000	are indispensable.
6252000	6254000	He was the co-founder of Microsoft,
6254000	6257000	and so his own quiet and persistent ways created magical products,
6257000	6260000	experiences, and institutions.
6260000	6264000	He founded Microsoft along with Bill Gates in 1975.
6264000	6268000	He did leave the company in 1982 when he was first diagnosed,
6268000	6271000	but then I think he was on the board or something for a little while,
6271000	6274000	and he didn't really officially resign from the board
6274000	6276000	until a few years ago.
6276000	6278000	He wasn't only known for Microsoft, though, however.
6278000	6279000	He did some other things.
6279000	6281000	He owned sports teams. I know that.
6281000	6283000	He was a big presence in the Pacific Northwest
6283000	6285000	because he owned the Portland Trail Blazers.
6285000	6287000	He owned the Seahawks.
6287000	6291000	He founded Vulcan, which is a lot of the philanthropy type of things
6291000	6292000	are through that,
6292000	6296000	and Ticketmaster was also something I think that he was an investor in.
6296000	6299000	I don't know how much he did with that, but he did that as well.
6299000	6304000	He was invested in various apps, one called SportsStream,
6304000	6306000	which is like a social app for sports people,
6306000	6311000	and he had a controlling interest in charter communications at one point too.
6311000	6313000	So, you know, he took all that Microsoft money
6313000	6315000	and basically invested in all these other companies.
6315000	6317000	So he's had a huge impact on the tech world
6317000	6319000	and unfortunately no longer with us,
6319000	6322000	so a lot of people are remembering him this week.
6322000	6324000	Going to our chat at live.vognetwork.com,
6324000	6327000	Bobby Blackwell says he co-founded TechTV,
6327000	6330000	which was eaten by G4 after he gave up on it.
6330000	6333000	He said the reason why Comcast bought TechTV,
6333000	6334000	and this is Bobby's comments in our chat,
6334000	6337000	is because Paul Allen was bored with it and wanted to get rid of it.
6337000	6339000	I did not realize that.
6339000	6342000	Wow, that's also very huge.
6342000	6343000	I'm glad he got bored with it.
6343000	6344000	Yeah, right?
6344000	6346000	Somebody should have found a way to entertain him.
6346000	6347000	What did he want to see on the...
6348000	6350000	Did he want, like, dancing kittens on the network?
6350000	6352000	Because if so, they should have just had that show at night.
6352000	6353000	We'll get you all the kittens.
6353000	6354000	Keep Paul Allen happy.
6354000	6356000	That merger would have never happened.
6356000	6358000	Anyway, that's unfortunate.
6358000	6360000	Well, you know, think of it this way.
6360000	6362000	TechTV and G4 and all that suck.
6362000	6364000	It didn't suck when Paul Allen was involved.
6364000	6368000	And when he left, well, you know the rest.
6370000	6371000	Anyway.
6373000	6374000	Let's move on.
6374000	6376000	We're going to open up our Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,
6376000	6378000	all one word, if you want to give us a call during our show.
6378000	6381000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
6381000	6382000	We're running really short tonight.
6382000	6383000	It's not even 8 o'clock yet.
6383000	6385000	But I feel like the news,
6385000	6388000	like a lot of the news isn't really like,
6388000	6389000	it's a lot of quick hits.
6389000	6392000	You don't have a lot of really deep dive news stories this week.
6392000	6394000	But maybe you have something you want to talk about
6394000	6396000	or bring up that we didn't get to.
6396000	6397000	Sure. Well, since we mentioned,
6397000	6399000	we were talking about backwards compatibility
6399000	6400000	with the Orange Box and stuff.
6400000	6403000	Guess what your Xbox One can run now?
6403000	6404000	Crysis.
6404000	6405000	Crysis.
6405000	6407000	It can run Crysis 1, 2, and 3.
6407000	6409000	Where's Breslull? He needs to know.
6409000	6411000	They're all backwards compatible.
6411000	6414000	So go play your Crysis games.
6414000	6416000	Hooray!
6416000	6418000	And then, of course,
6418000	6421000	there's a game I don't like to talk about because it's garbage.
6421000	6424000	But hey, this garbage game called Metal Gear Solid,
6424000	6426000	or Metal Gear Survive,
6426000	6429000	they're doing an event where you can get a Pyramid Head costume
6429000	6431000	and they have Castlevania music
6431000	6435000	because it's just a total fucking shit show.
6435000	6438000	Because Konami realizes that the retro stuff sells.
6438000	6440000	They don't really know how to sell it yet,
6440000	6442000	so they just kind of throw it everywhere and see what sticks.
6442000	6443000	Just don't.
6443000	6444000	Just no one.
6444000	6445000	No.
6445000	6446000	Don't buy the game.
6446000	6447000	Terrible.
6447000	6448000	Terrible game.
6448000	6452000	And then, man, this is a flashback for me.
6452000	6454000	Independent game shops are told they're not going to get
6454000	6456000	Red Dead Redemption 2 until November.
6456000	6459000	Yep, that's unfortunate.
6459000	6462000	And that's pretty typical because
6462000	6465000	when demand goes up, there's only a finite amount of copies,
6465000	6467000	and guess who gets those copies?
6467000	6468000	The large retailers.
6468000	6469000	Amazon.
6469000	6470000	Amazon.
6470000	6475000	Which is why your old company, sadly, is no longer around, really.
6475000	6477000	In part.
6477000	6479000	Yeah, lots of reasons, but yes.
6479000	6480000	That's definitely...
6480000	6483000	It didn't help being in those situations.
6483000	6486000	I had to be in the end of telling people a lot of times,
6486000	6489000	Hey, you know all the Call of Duty's you order for launch day?
6489000	6491000	Yeah, you're gonna get them launch day.
6491000	6492000	A lot of times.
6492000	6494000	And I'm sure they loved to hear that.
6494000	6496000	They got used to it.
6496000	6497000	Unfortunately.
6497000	6498000	That's horrible.
6498000	6499000	It is.
6499000	6500000	A hitstun in chat says,
6500000	6503000	Oh, I didn't know Loki OLR's old company isn't around anymore.
6503000	6505000	Well, the company might still be there, right?
6505000	6506000	No, it's gone.
6506000	6509000	The whole company went under, so they sold to their competitors,
6509000	6511000	and then...
6511000	6512000	I don't know if they...
6512000	6514000	I'm assuming they kept part of the game's version.
6514000	6516000	They kept a couple of people on from the game's thing,
6516000	6520000	but they have their own games company as well,
6520000	6522000	so it was kind of overlap.
6522000	6524000	But then they kept some of the...
6524000	6528000	like 30 of the people from my company, the video side,
6528000	6531000	over, and they opened like a satellite branch or whatever,
6531000	6534000	but yeah, they closed down in 2014, so...
6534000	6536000	Now I've moved on to bigger and better things.
6536000	6538000	So, it's all good.
6538000	6541000	Just don't have to deal with the game drama anymore.
6541000	6543000	Trust me, it's a lot less stressful now.
6543000	6545000	Yeah, what you do now is a lot less stressful.
6545000	6546000	Yeah, a hell lot less stressful.
6546000	6548000	You're a career man now.
6548000	6552000	Yeah, it's using my potential even better.
6552000	6555000	Do you get asked to do crunch time at your current job?
6555000	6556000	No.
6556000	6557000	No?
6557000	6558000	No.
6558000	6562000	No, I just get people angry because...
6562000	6564000	Well, don't say too much about your career.
6564000	6568000	I manage data, and so I point out when they're not managing their own data, and so...
6568000	6569000	People don't like to hear that.
6569000	6571000	And they don't like hearing that, like,
6572000	6573000	And they're like,
6573000	6576000	Okay, and then I check back six months later,
6576000	6578000	why haven't you cleaned this crap up yet?
6578000	6579000	And they're like,
6579000	6583000	Why are you always coming down on us and throwing us under the bus?
6583000	6586000	I'm like, because you're not fucking doing your work after six months.
6586000	6587000	Yeah.
6587000	6590000	No, I go through a similar struggle in what I do.
6590000	6592000	I mean, I love my job, don't get me wrong,
6592000	6594000	and I've never talked negative about my job on the show,
6594000	6596000	but, you know, part of my job is I do training,
6596000	6598000	and I train in medical-related things,
6598000	6600000	so you know HIPAA is a big thing, you know,
6600000	6602000	privacy of patient information.
6602000	6605000	So basically, part of my job is just making sure that every year,
6605000	6607000	everybody's doing their training, because that's, you know, the law.
6607000	6610000	But some people don't like the fact that I know
6610000	6613000	when they're not taking their HIPAA training on a yearly basis,
6613000	6615000	because I come to track them down saying,
6615000	6618000	You know, you do have to take your 30 minutes and do this training,
6618000	6620000	you know, 30 minutes a year to do this training,
6620000	6623000	because, you know, we're kind of like legally have to do that.
6623000	6626000	And some of these people, you know, they're very, very high up,
6626000	6628000	and they don't really want to be told that,
6628000	6630000	because it's like, I don't write the laws, buddy.
6630000	6632000	Yeah.
6632000	6634000	So, yeah. Anyhow.
6634000	6637000	Let's see. Bonds006 in chat says,
6637000	6639000	Clean your damn room.
6639000	6641000	It's kind of similar to that.
6641000	6644000	It is. I mean, it's stupid stuff that I have to manage.
6644000	6647000	You know, it's stuff I don't technically have to manage.
6647000	6650000	I've just taken it upon myself to manage, because it annoys me,
6650000	6653000	because I used to be in the position where I had to clean.
6653000	6655000	Well, I still have to clean it up now,
6655000	6657000	but I used to be in a position where, you know,
6657000	6661000	it's done, and it's just a cascading effect.
6661000	6663000	Yeah. One more call for calls.
6663000	6666000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype,
6666000	6669000	if you want to give us a call and talk about whatever's on your mind tonight.
6669000	6672000	This is one of those nights. It's going to be a quiet night here at Studio LR.
6672000	6674000	You know, if I don't end up using my second camera,
6674000	6677000	we have a nice HD camera, HD and 4K camera,
6677000	6679000	that we could totally use in this room.
6679000	6683000	Yoink. Let's steal that. Set that up.
6683000	6686000	I don't know if that XP computer can handle that,
6686000	6690000	but we can definitely put it on a new computer.
6690000	6692000	If you don't feel like calling, we'll field,
6692000	6694000	because I know it is a little short,
6694000	6699000	I will field questions in chat at live.orangelandradio.com.
6699000	6703000	Jesus Christ. Maybe if I wasn't broken, we wouldn't have such a short show.
6703000	6707000	live.vognetwork.com if you want to post any questions.
6707000	6711000	We'll just, you know, we can take open questions in our chat room,
6711000	6713000	since we are running a little short.
6713000	6715000	But yeah, no, that would be great. Actually, that's a huge,
6715000	6719000	that's one thing off the list. It's more the computer is the big thing I have to buy.
6719000	6721000	And then we're gonna have to think about how to rearrange this room,
6721000	6725000	because ideally, all of us will be against this wall here,
6725000	6728000	so this wall can kind of be green, and we can do tricks with it.
6728000	6731000	And so that way, because obviously we can't be at the same,
6731000	6734000	because right now, the way we're facing, if we were to put a camera face,
6734000	6736000	like you would see my dirty kitchen behind everything.
6736000	6740000	It's just like shit everywhere in the kitchen. I don't want to shoot at that angle.
6740000	6741000	You could face it this way.
6741000	6744000	You could. You could do it this way against this larger wall here.
6744000	6745000	That's something we could do.
6745000	6747000	Because then you have all the posters up already.
6747000	6749000	It's just the lighting in this room is not exactly what you're supposed to do.
6749000	6753000	Yeah, this isn't exactly the best studio, but we can figure that out.
6753000	6755000	Keep in mind, the green screen that I did buy came with more lights.
6755000	6757000	I just don't use them because they can get hot.
6757000	6758000	Yeah.
6758000	6759000	So, but...
6759000	6760000	I almost got a green screen, but then I was like,
6760000	6762000	no, I've already spent enough money on this crap.
6762000	6764000	I still may, because that was the other thing too,
6764000	6766000	is like if I don't end up using the camera for this,
6766000	6772000	I still may keep it for when I actually do non-DDR content as well,
6772000	6774000	which we can always buy another one.
6774000	6779000	Doesn't the chat, I mean, chat, do you want us to have a green screen behind it?
6779000	6782000	I mean, shouldn't we be able to float away to different worlds
6782000	6784000	and different places on a whim?
6784000	6788000	Or have the games that we're talking about possibly behind them?
6788000	6790000	Well, we could do like a total, because now that I've messed with OBS now,
6790000	6792000	and I'm like a little bit more comfortable,
6792000	6794000	we can do like a lot of fancy shit with that, so.
6794000	6795000	Yeah.
6795000	6796000	Well, I mean, we're all the...
6796000	6798000	I don't know how much I can say on,
6798000	6801000	but there's already one fancy kind of thing that Bobby is working on.
6801000	6803000	So that's all I can say.
6803000	6804000	Yeah.
6804000	6805000	So it'd be kind of nice.
6805000	6806000	I think it's fancy.
6806000	6810000	Anyway, S2100matt in chat says, nah, start with a regular studio show.
6810000	6813000	Well, I mean, don't worry, Matt.
6813000	6816000	I'm not going to go crazy out the gate, and it is still a radio show,
6816000	6819000	but it would be nice to have like the green screen,
6819000	6821000	and we could just put like a static image,
6821000	6823000	but when we're talking about a particular game,
6823000	6824000	like the classic game of the week,
6824000	6826000	have some of the footage of the game of the week running behind it
6826000	6827000	on the green screen.
6827000	6828000	It'd be kind of nice, wouldn't it?
6828000	6829000	So, all right.
6829000	6832000	Anyhow, which Tigerclaw is exactly saying in chat.
6832000	6834000	Yes, that is ideal.
6834000	6836000	Anyway, we do have a call finally coming in.
6836000	6837000	Y'all are slow tonight.
6837000	6838000	Hi, you're on Orson's Radio.
6838000	6839000	Who's this?
6839000	6840000	Hey, Bizack Def.
6840000	6841000	Oops, she didn't hear what I just said.
6841000	6842000	Did you?
6842000	6843000	Hi, Bizack Def.
6843000	6844000	How are you, buddy?
6844000	6848000	Well, basically, I want to talk about Pokemon Go.
6848000	6849000	Sure.
6849000	6850000	Why not?
6850000	6851000	Why not?
6851000	6852000	Let's be a Pokemon Go show.
6852000	6854000	What do you want to talk about?
6854000	6859000	Well, since we don't have a Pokestop podcast.
6859000	6865000	Anyways, but I want to talk about something you were talking
6865000	6871000	on your gaming week sense of older people playing Pokemon Go,
6871000	6875000	and it's something that, in my case,
6875000	6880000	I also said it's all people playing Pokemon Go
6880000	6888000	or people with under 50s, maybe in their 60s too,
6888000	6892000	but at least in my city, I have known many people
6892000	6897000	that actually are families, and they play together,
6897000	6901000	and it's really, really amazing.
6901000	6909000	And even though the age difference is kind of big,
6909000	6915000	we can still talk together, and we have a really great time,
6915000	6920000	even though, like Bobby said, it's a dead game, unquote.
6920000	6925000	It's still really fun to hang out with people of every age.
6925000	6928000	Bobby still opens my gifts pretty regularly,
6928000	6933000	so he doesn't really think it's a dead game, just so we're clear.
6933000	6934000	Yeah, I know.
6934000	6935000	I'm just teasing.
6935000	6941000	Even like yesterday, we got the Ultra Friend level.
6941000	6944000	I was about to say, actually, funny we bring that up,
6944000	6946000	so let me out, Bobby, on something else here too,
6946000	6950000	is that I hit level 40 in Pokemon Go this week.
6950000	6951000	I can't believe I left that out of my gaming week,
6951000	6952000	but I hit the maximum.
6952000	6954000	I totally neglected to say this.
6954000	6955000	Congrats again.
6955000	6958000	I hit the maximum level in Pokemon Go,
6958000	6961000	which means not only am I the maximum level in Pokemon Go
6961000	6963000	and the maximum level in Ingress.
6963000	6966000	So in both of my antics, I'm a 60-40, or 16-40,
6966000	6968000	which means I'm the max level in Ingress.
6968000	6970000	That must mean you're a shoo-in for whatever beta
6970000	6972000	they're going to have for the Harry Potter game.
6972000	6973000	I can't fucking wait.
6973000	6975000	I hope that Harry Potter game kicks ass.
6975000	6976000	Look at my credentials.
6976000	6977000	Look at my credentials.
6977000	6978000	Exactly, right?
6978000	6980000	But yeah, I hit level 40,
6980000	6982000	and the reason why I'm invoking Bobby when I do it,
6982000	6985000	even though he didn't message me to tell me he triggered it
6985000	6987000	so I could pop an experience egg, it's okay.
6987000	6991000	I was so close that when Bobby and I hit three star friends,
6991000	6994000	that is what pushed me to level 40,
6994000	6996000	was Bobby and I's friendship.
6996000	7000000	So Bobby, even though you say Pokemon Go is a dead game,
7000000	7001000	I just want you to remember,
7001000	7004000	our friendship made me the nerd I am today.
7008000	7011000	I did pop an egg, though, when we had four star friends.
7011000	7015000	Yeah, and I think the latest patch to the game
7015000	7017000	made it harder to get the jump on that
7017000	7018000	when you first opened the app,
7018000	7019000	because I open up the app, I'm like,
7019000	7020000	okay, I need to go pop an egg,
7020000	7022000	and before I could even hit items, it's like,
7022000	7023000	you and Loki O-L-R are friends.
7023000	7026000	I'm like, god damn it, I didn't get a chance to pop the egg.
7026000	7027000	I think they might have made that harder
7027000	7031000	because so many people were really milking XP from that.
7031000	7032000	That's easy.
7032000	7035000	Don't make your stupid eggs count towards that, then.
7035000	7037000	Yeah, that would be one way to do it.
7037000	7040000	Or, at the same time, is it really that bad
7040000	7043000	because people are buying those experience eggs?
7043000	7045000	I just need all the fucking notifications
7045000	7046000	that pop immediately.
7046000	7049000	I'm trying to sync my Pokemon.
7049000	7051000	Did you upgrade the latest version
7051000	7054000	where they consolidated all the notifications?
7054000	7055000	They don't, though.
7055000	7057000	It's still good at every...
7057000	7061000	Yeah, but at least they moved the icon for the Go Plus down
7061000	7062000	so it doesn't get in the way now.
7062000	7064000	No, it's still in the way.
7064000	7066000	Oh, because you don't have an iPhone X.
7066000	7068000	You have the smaller screen iPhone, right?
7068000	7070000	The screen's not that small.
7070000	7071000	It's just like, I don't know.
7071000	7072000	It's stupid.
7072000	7075000	I just don't want the notifications.
7075000	7076000	Interesting.
7076000	7077000	That is weird.
7077000	7078000	Anyway, sorry.
7078000	7079000	I didn't mean to make it about me, Act F,
7079000	7081000	but I felt that was an important point,
7081000	7082000	is that I hit level 40.
7082000	7084000	I'm the biggest nerd.
7084000	7087000	Well, technically, I hit level 40 before you, bud.
7087000	7090000	I'm still level 7 on Ingress, though.
7090000	7092000	Oh, well, at least I have that.
7092000	7093000	I have that.
7093000	7097000	I think I'm only the second player in Sacramento
7097000	7100000	that I know of, but the problem is
7100000	7102000	our team and the Resistance team in Ingress
7102000	7104000	don't exactly mingle a lot,
7104000	7108000	so I don't know if any of them are level 40 in Pokemon Go.
7108000	7110000	I suspect one of them might be,
7110000	7112000	but you can't really ping a player in Pokemon Go
7112000	7114000	like you can in Ingress to check their profile,
7114000	7117000	so if I'm not second, I'm probably third,
7117000	7119000	but that's in this whole city.
7119000	7121000	It's pretty disgusting.
7121000	7126000	That's still a really great achievement,
7126000	7129000	getting max levels on both games.
7129000	7130000	Thank you.
7130000	7132000	Again, congrats on that,
7133000	7135000	especially on Ingress. It's not easy.
7135000	7136000	It's not.
7136000	7138000	It is not. It is really not.
7138000	7141000	It's taken, but you know, I've met so many rats.
7141000	7144000	Just on Saturday, just yesterday,
7144000	7148000	we had a get-together of about 27 players here locally.
7148000	7152000	Just got together and had lunch and having a good old time.
7152000	7154000	We were kind of playing the game together, actually,
7154000	7155000	and a couple times this week.
7155000	7157000	I don't usually talk about this type of stuff during my gaming week
7157000	7160000	just because I feel like people probably get bored with Ingress chat,
7160000	7163000	but it's a short show, so here you go.
7163000	7165000	We got together twice.
7165000	7167000	We did it Thursday night, and then we did it Friday night as well
7167000	7170000	because we thought it would be funny
7170000	7172000	because the other team had to spend a couple hours
7172000	7174000	to take down what we did Thursday night,
7174000	7176000	so we were like, let's do it again, and we did it bigger.
7176000	7181000	So we were just having fun.
7181000	7184000	So what we do, we all get in two separate cars,
7184000	7188000	and we drive down what we call the grid, so downtown,
7188000	7191000	and we build these portals to max level and max strength.
7191000	7194000	But the whole time we're riding in the car,
7194000	7197000	we're just cracking jokes and talking and just having a good time,
7197000	7199000	and it's like all these people from different walks of life
7199000	7202000	who play this game, like these people I would have never met,
7202000	7204000	but they just happen to play the same game, you know what I mean?
7204000	7206000	Yeah, especially.
7206000	7211000	And turning back to the main topic I was going to talk about,
7211000	7216000	it's really awesome that you can pretty much hang out
7216000	7218000	with any kind of people.
7218000	7223000	I have played with people way younger than me,
7223000	7226000	again, people older.
7226000	7230000	It's something I really, really like about this game
7230000	7234000	and the community itself, especially in Pokémon GO,
7234000	7239000	because in Ingress we all know that doesn't happen really frequently,
7239000	7242000	but in Pokémon GO, even if you're like,
7242000	7246000	I'm Team Valor or I'm Team Mystic, I'm Team Instinct,
7246000	7250000	you can still help each other in so many ways.
7250000	7253000	Sadly, Ingress is very much not like that.
7253000	7256000	The whole game thing and that stuff, it's like another thing,
7256000	7259000	but it's not like the main thing, and I like that.
7259000	7260000	I like that.
7260000	7261000	Yeah.
7261000	7264000	How do you feel about the whole Pokéstops in Mexico?
7264000	7267000	Now, you're right outside, because they tend to draw the borders
7267000	7270000	at a certain latitude and longitude for that kind of stuff,
7270000	7273000	and you live just north of where they drew that border, right?
7273000	7275000	Yeah.
7275000	7280000	They launched the beta in Mexico on Tuesday, if I remember correctly,
7280000	7284000	and I'm level 40, so I'm awesome.
7284000	7287000	I'm going to play Pokéstops and all that stuff.
7287000	7294000	And when I open the app, the Pokéstop nomination doesn't appear,
7294000	7298000	so I started investigating, and also it has to do with Ingress
7298000	7302000	and how the cells work, how they tie up their place.
7302000	7304000	Oh, yeah.
7304000	7309000	So yeah, I can't nominate Pokéstops.
7309000	7317000	I have even nominated four, but I nominated four way south of the city,
7317000	7320000	the outskirts, literally, of the city.
7320000	7321000	Okay.
7321000	7328000	So yeah, I had to go way, probably not an hour,
7328000	7333000	but close to an hour from my home to at least try it.
7333000	7340000	And curiously, and this one, I'm really frustrated about it.
7340000	7346000	From where I work, it's like a kilometer away
7346000	7348000	where I can start nominating Pokéstops.
7348000	7350000	So it's like, really?
7350000	7353000	One kilometer away?
7353000	7355000	Yeah, so close yet so far.
7355000	7356000	But you know what's funny?
7356000	7359000	And so I get the other end of that because I am the high enough level in Ingress.
7359000	7361000	I do review stuff in OPR.
7361000	7363000	I haven't seen stuff that's come in from Pokémon yet,
7363000	7365000	and supposedly you can tell the difference
7365000	7369000	because Pokémon makes you take an extra picture, which is great.
7369000	7372000	That's actually a really good thing, and more stuff will go through because of that.
7372000	7376000	And just a tip, if you are going to submit stuff in Pokémon GO,
7376000	7379000	make sure you're not just submitting two of the exact same picture.
7379000	7382000	Do one close-up, especially if it's a plaque.
7382000	7386000	Do one picture of the plaque, and then do one way back
7386000	7389000	where you can see the plaque, but you can see what it's on
7389000	7391000	and that it's not in a private building somewhere,
7391000	7394000	that it's outside somewhere accessible on a sidewalk.
7394000	7397000	Because if I see that, it's publicly accessible somewhere like that,
7397000	7399000	I'm way more likely to approve it.
7399000	7402000	That's the rules. It has to be publicly accessible.
7402000	7404000	It can't be in a median.
7404000	7406000	And especially in a place like Mexico,
7406000	7410000	the Google Street technology is not the same as it is in the States,
7410000	7413000	so we don't necessarily have street view for everything.
7413000	7418000	Even here in California, I get reviews for some stuff in Mexico.
7418000	7421000	And the other day I got a church,
7421000	7425000	and all I had to go off of was the satellite view
7425000	7427000	and a really super close-up picture.
7427000	7431000	And I still approved it in good faith, pun intended.
7431000	7434000	I still approved it because there was like no pokey stops around.
7434000	7436000	I was like, you know what?
7436000	7439000	And the picture was definitely like a church-related thing,
7439000	7441000	and I'm like, I'm just going to trust this is legit
7441000	7444000	because on the satellite view, there was nothing for me to distinguish
7444000	7446000	that that was indeed a church and not somebody's house.
7446000	7449000	And that's the thing you're always paranoid of in Ingress.
7449000	7451000	You do not want somebody's house to get a portal,
7451000	7453000	and people will try it.
7453000	7459000	Oh, yeah. I know people that kind of have tried this on Ingress.
7460000	7463000	But yeah, talking about the process in Pokemon Go,
7463000	7469000	there's more steps because it's not only take the picture,
7469000	7472000	name the title, description, and that's it.
7472000	7475000	No, you do have to take another picture,
7475000	7482000	though I didn't know that you can take a wider shot of the same place.
7482000	7486000	What I have done is just like in one of the pokey stops,
7486000	7488000	I tried to nominate.
7488000	7494000	It's a mural of Virgencita, the Virgenava de Lupe.
7494000	7499000	And so I took the picture of the mural itself,
7499000	7502000	and then I turned around and turned to the street.
7502000	7505000	So I took the place that surrounds,
7505000	7509000	because it tells you the place that surrounds the pokey stops.
7509000	7511000	So I took it in that sense.
7511000	7513000	Oh, right.
7513000	7516000	If that gets rejected, do it again,
7516000	7518000	and do your one of the mural,
7518000	7521000	and then cross the street and take a picture
7521000	7525000	where you see the mural and the entire house that it's on.
7525000	7527000	That's what they're looking for.
7527000	7529000	That is not necessarily a house.
7529000	7532000	It's like a taco stand.
7532000	7535000	Okay, that's fine. If it's a taco stand, it doesn't matter.
7535000	7536000	Because what they want to know,
7536000	7538000	they just want to make sure it's not temporary.
7538000	7539000	It's not a taco truck.
7539000	7541000	It's a permanent taco stand of some sort.
7541000	7542000	You know what I mean?
7542000	7546000	It's permanent, so it's the wall.
7546000	7549000	And even though I took the picture of the street itself,
7549000	7552000	so it's not necessarily that bad.
7552000	7555000	But if it gets rejected, I'm going to try again
7555000	7557000	and do that, especially,
7557000	7560000	because I did get a pokey stop rejected,
7560000	7564000	but I think it was because of the placement it has,
7564000	7570000	because it's next to a firefighter place,
7570000	7573000	and also next to a police station.
7573000	7574000	So, yeah.
7574000	7576000	You know what I think I'll do one night?
7576000	7578000	I don't think there's any NDA or anything.
7578000	7580000	I really don't, because OPR is out there.
7580000	7581000	I think one night I'm going to do this,
7581000	7583000	if you guys would be interested in this.
7583000	7586000	I don't think everybody would be interested in this.
7586000	7588000	But at one point, I think what I'm going to do,
7588000	7591000	I'm going to do a stream on Twitch
7591000	7593000	of reviewing portals in OPR
7593000	7595000	so you guys can see what I'm doing
7595000	7597000	and what you see in that whole process.
7597000	7599000	Would that be fun? Would that be interesting?
7599000	7601000	I would watch it.
7601000	7603000	Yeah, cool. No, I think I'll do that at some point.
7603000	7605000	Not tonight. Bobby's going to do the post-stream tonight,
7605000	7608000	but I'm going to plan that for this week sometime.
7608000	7609000	I think that would be just a quick stream
7609000	7612000	just so you can kind of get a sense of what all goes into that.
7612000	7614000	I bet some of the Pokémon GO fans would be really curious
7614000	7619000	what an Ingress player is looking for in approving that,
7619000	7622000	because I know not everybody in the Pokémon GO.
7622000	7624000	The nice thing about being 1640 now
7624000	7628000	is I really feel like I can speak to both games with authority.
7628000	7630000	You know what I mean?
7630000	7632000	Because I've put my time in in both games, right?
7632000	7635000	So I feel like what the Pokémon GO crowd
7635000	7637000	doesn't kind of get about the Ingress crowd,
7637000	7638000	because they're like, what?
7638000	7641000	These people that play another game have the say on it.
7641000	7643000	But again, and I've said this a lot on OLR,
7643000	7646000	the Ingress players are also going to be much more scrutiny
7646000	7649000	of what is legit and what is not than Pokémon GO,
7649000	7651000	because there's really not a lot of downside
7651000	7655000	to Pokémon stops and gyms pretty much anywhere.
7655000	7657000	Although, as SHO 100 Matt points out,
7657000	7659000	you can't stop somewhere in somebody's backyard
7659000	7661000	on a memorial plaque that they put in their backyard,
7661000	7663000	and that's not okay.
7663000	7665000	But by having put that time in an Ingress
7665000	7667000	where you understand better the PvP nature of the game,
7667000	7670000	you understand why the game board can't be full of garbage.
7670000	7673000	It has to be places that are interesting.
7673000	7675000	And again, the cool thing about Ingress
7675000	7677000	is that it really has taken me to all these places
7677000	7680000	I wouldn't have given a shit about otherwise.
7680000	7683000	And to have discovered some of these different murals
7683000	7687000	or really gorgeous graveyard memorial sites
7687000	7690000	or the fact that there are more Korean churches
7690000	7693000	than I can count on my side of town and all this stuff,
7693000	7696000	I would have never known that before, you know?
7696000	7698000	Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
7698000	7699000	Yeah.
7699000	7701000	I still have tons of Poké stuff
7701000	7704000	that I haven't visited in my own town, so yeah.
7704000	7706000	Yeah. Very cool stuff.
7706000	7709000	Well, Act F, I appreciate the conversation on Pokémon.
7709000	7710000	It's one of my favorite subjects,
7710000	7711000	but I should let you go to see
7711000	7713000	if anyone else wants to sneak in, okay?
7713000	7714000	Okay, no problem.
7714000	7715000	All right, have a good one, buddy.
7715000	7716000	Thanks for having me.
7716000	7719000	Hey, any time. Thanks for being here. Bye.
7719000	7722000	All right, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype,
7722000	7724000	if you want to give us a call.
7724000	7727000	We'll leave it open for a little bit longer to see
7727000	7728000	because I thought I saw somebody in chat
7728000	7729000	say they wanted to try to get in,
7729000	7730000	so I'll leave it open a little bit longer
7730000	7732000	to see if anyone else wants to get in.
7732000	7734000	But otherwise, we'll probably wrap up here pretty soon.
7734000	7736000	Don't apologize for taking up time, Act F.
7736000	7737000	It was a good call.
7737000	7739000	Let's see, and again, Bobby Blackwell's
7739000	7741000	going to be doing the post-show stream tonight.
7741000	7743000	For those of you that are listening live,
7743000	7745000	you can check out his Twitch channel,
7745000	7746000	at BobbyBlackWolf.
7746000	7748000	You can check out mine, at Rob Roberts.
7748000	7751000	You can check out Loki's, at Loki O-L-R.
7751000	7752000	Yep.
7752000	7754000	And then, also, you should add VOG Network
7754000	7756000	while you're at it if you're not already there
7756000	7758000	because even though there's not a lot there yet,
7758000	7760000	you can anticipate that very soon,
7760000	7763000	you're going to start seeing more and more at VOG Network.
7763000	7765000	And we'll let you know more
7765000	7767000	when that's going to come into play.
7767000	7770000	Also, I should do a cheap shout-out for our Discord,
7770000	7774000	which you can go to at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
7774000	7776000	You can check that out.
7776000	7779000	And, you know, we pull stories for the show
7779000	7781000	from our Discord that you guys submit.
7781000	7783000	If you do like Pokémon GO, we have a little channel
7783000	7786000	where people kind of just share screenshots, friend codes,
7786000	7788000	things of that sort, and all that.
7788000	7790000	By the way, speaking of VOG,
7790000	7792000	I was going to do this for my final thought,
7792000	7794000	but since we have a little extra time,
7794000	7796000	I'll just elaborate a little more on it now.
7796000	7798000	This is the final episode of one of our, you know,
7798000	7800000	really starter shows here at VOG Network.
7800000	7802000	Remember the final episode tomorrow.
7802000	7805000	So it's, you know, we just want to bid a fond farewell
7805000	7807000	and thanks to the memories to Pod Culture,
7807000	7809000	who's going to be signing off tomorrow
7809000	7811000	with their final episode after, god,
7811000	7813000	I think it's like 12, 13 years.
7813000	7815000	I lost count, but they've been going over 10 years.
7815000	7817000	You know, on and off, granted.
7817000	7819000	They've, you know, had to have some time off
7819000	7821000	due to personal challenges,
7821000	7823000	but, you know, they still were able
7823000	7825000	to crank out the final episode.
7826000	7830000	So he will be signing off with his crew tomorrow
7830000	7832000	here at the Voice Geeks Network.
7832000	7834000	It's 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,
7834000	7836000	and we just want to say thank you very much
7836000	7838000	to Brad and the whole crew over at Pod Culture
7838000	7841000	for being here with the network for so long,
7841000	7843000	and I think there are some more things
7843000	7845000	that he has in store for the future.
7845000	7847000	He has said that they are not going to stop
7847000	7850000	doing the TARDIS interruptus kind of side stuff
7850000	7852000	they do with Doctor Who,
7852000	7855000	and I know a lot of people are really into this new series.
7855000	7858000	I saw a lot of rave reviews for the episode that was today.
7858000	7859000	Of course, I'm not going to spoil,
7859000	7860000	because I don't watch it myself,
7860000	7861000	so I wouldn't know what to spoil,
7861000	7863000	but I know I was seeing some rave reviews
7863000	7864000	on Twitters for today's episode,
7864000	7866000	so I know a lot of people are super into Doctor Who right now
7866000	7869000	that the Doctor regeneration is kind of, you know,
7869000	7872000	just always kind of re-energizes the fan base.
7872000	7876000	So, anyhow, Loki, any other stories you want to get out here
7876000	7878000	before we sign off for the night?
7878000	7879000	Nope, I don't have anything.
7879000	7881000	All right, and our phone really isn't ringing,
7881000	7882000	so I think that's it.
7882000	7884000	I think we're going to sign off a little early.
7884000	7886000	It's a little bit of a shorter show, but what can you do?
7886000	7889000	It gives Loki more time to go play Pokemon Go, doesn't it?
7889000	7891000	Uh, yeah, I have to go.
7891000	7893000	Do you have your Chimchar and your Piplup
7893000	7895000	and your Turtwig and all the Gen 4 stuff?
7895000	7897000	I have, yeah, a lot of those already,
7897000	7899000	so I'm just collecting them as they come.
7899000	7901000	What is my Synodex up to right now?
7901000	7902000	It's up to ten.
7902000	7904000	I have ten in the Synodex,
7904000	7906000	but you know what, I'm purposely holding back a little bit,
7906000	7909000	because I have the candy to evolve a Chimchar and a Piplup,
7909000	7913000	but I don't have one that is the highest appraisal for the good IVs.
7913000	7915000	I'm waiting until I get those.
7915000	7917000	I did get a Turtwig with high IVs,
7917000	7921000	and so I evolved the Groviel, Grotle? Grotle is what they're called.
7921000	7923000	I evolved one of those.
7923000	7926000	So I have ten of the new, because you know I got Bidoof.
7926000	7928000	I love me some Bidoof.
7928000	7931000	And actually, speaking of Gen 4, there's a little Kricketot,
7931000	7933000	the little red cricket that's in a suit.
7933000	7935000	There's one of those in the house right now.
7935000	7936000	I've already evolved one of those.
7936000	7938000	I haven't evolved one yet, because again, I can't get one
7938000	7939000	that's the highest appraisal.
7939000	7941000	They're weak as shit. Who cares?
7941000	7943000	Just evolve it and delete it.
7943000	7946000	I know, because I'm neurotic about that stuff.
7946000	7949000	What I'll do, if I get enough candies to evolve two,
7949000	7951000	then I probably will.
7951000	7954000	That's all I do, especially if it's a bird.
7954000	7957000	I'm like, you're just essentially garbage.
7957000	7959000	I'm just going to evolve you and throw you away.
7959000	7963000	Well, my concern is that those Gen 4 starters are everywhere right now,
7963000	7966000	but as they start to unleash more and more of Gen 4,
7966000	7968000	this stuff's going to scale back.
7968000	7971000	So I want to try to catch the wonder.
7971000	7976000	I got one of the Bonaire ones I had to get in a raid.
7976000	7978000	Oh my god, how about that?
7978000	7980000	The Kricketot is on the house? Wonder.
7980000	7982000	That's my first one.
7982000	7985000	So it's HP, stats exceed my calculations.
7985000	7987000	So it's level 15 HP. So there you go.
7987000	7989000	I'm going to get to 11 right here, live on the show.
7989000	7991000	I'm going to evolve that Kricketot right now.
7991000	7993000	How about that? Complaining works!
7993000	7995000	Hooray!
7996000	7999000	I think the one I got is the same specs, isn't it?
7999000	8001000	Yeah, the Wonder HP.
8001000	8002000	Yeah, nice, right?
8002000	8004000	You know, they should all be the same Pokemon.
8004000	8008000	That looks like a Kricket with a porn mustache or something.
8008000	8011000	That's quite something there, that little evolve one.
8011000	8012000	It's more like a collar.
8012000	8014000	Yeah, Kricketoon.
8014000	8017000	Oh god, their CP is horrible.
8017000	8019000	Yeah.
8019000	8021000	Oh, because they're bug type.
8021000	8023000	Anyway, apparently it's the Poke... I know.
8023000	8025000	Sorry Akuma, the Poke Show.
8025000	8027000	Hey, you know what?
8027000	8031000	It's something we play a lot of and there's a lot of excitement right now with the new generation.
8031000	8035000	But we will be talking about plenty more games coming up throughout the next week.
8035000	8037000	I know I want to get my hands on Soulcalibur 6.
8037000	8041000	Loki, Red Dead Redemption 2 is on your radar, I'm sure.
8041000	8044000	Yep, so we'll have some more games to talk about next week.
8044000	8046000	For download, so hopefully it'll be downloaded.
8046000	8049000	They said it was supposed to start downloading already, but...
8049000	8052000	That whole 100 gigs? The 100 gigs you got set aside?
8052000	8055000	Hey, I checked my Comcast the other day. I got plenty of gigs left.
8055000	8056000	It's good.
8056000	8059000	Especially after Free Leech on certain sites.
8059000	8061000	I was surprised that I have that much left.
8061000	8068000	I ate 120 or 122 gigs already this month just from Forza Horizon downloads alone.
8068000	8070000	But you know what? Worth it.
8070000	8073000	Yeah, I haven't played Horizon 4 in a while.
8073000	8076000	Oh, you need to. It's so good. I need to play more.
8076000	8079000	I need to let go of WoW, but this is what happens when I start doing MMOs.
8079000	8082000	Anyhow, let's wrap up.
8082000	8085000	Thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio.
8085000	8088000	Thank you for downloading our show and supporting us.
8088000	8090000	If you like what you heard, please tell a friend about the show.
8090000	8094000	Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if the voices are here to air.
8094000	8099000	Otherwise, a nice five-star review in a place like iTunes or wherever it is you found this show,
8099000	8102000	those go a long, long way and we really appreciate it.
8102000	8105000	We're going to wrap up and get final thoughts.
8105000	8107000	Loki, we'll go with you.
8107000	8113000	My final thought is I am not going to get rid of the second camera just yet
8113000	8117000	because I need, apparently, okay, this is stupid.
8117000	8122000	The stupid Fitbit app for PC, you have to sync it via a stupid $6 dongle you get to buy
8122000	8128000	even though it's fucking Bluetooth and my computer has fucking Bluetooth in it.
8128000	8131000	But no, you have to buy a stupid dongle.
8131000	8137000	So anyways, I'm going to try to be streaming maybe this week at 6.30 Pacific Time,
8137000	8139000	Monday through Friday, we'll see.
8139000	8141000	So just keep an eye on that.
8141000	8144000	Follow me if you want.
8144000	8146000	And I'm going to be doing some DDR stuff
8146000	8150000	and hopefully I'm not going to be too out of shape because it's yesterday when I played.
8150000	8158000	Granted, I play nonstop, so it's just straight back-to-back 30 minutes of actual playing DDR and heavy doubles.
8159000	8163000	That was tough. That was really tough.
8163000	8167000	So tune in though. It'll be fun.
8167000	8172000	Alright. Well, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
8172000	8177000	My final thought, I need to figure out what I'm going to dress up as for Halloween
8177000	8180000	or I'm going to have to recycle the pizza costume that Alan bought,
8180000	8182000	which is why there's a big foam piece of pizza sitting on the couch.
8182000	8183000	I was wondering about that.
8183000	8187000	That was Alan's Halloween costume he wore to a thing over the weekend.
8187000	8192000	And he dyed his hair orange with that temporary spray stuff and he wore a red shirt, so he was a big slice of pizza.
8192000	8196000	Yeah, I'm skipping Halloween this year just because.
8196000	8197000	You're no fun.
8197000	8200000	Well, no, because at my work they tend to do like,
8200000	8202000	we're voting on what we're going to do this year.
8202000	8204000	I just don't want to go with their stupid themes.
8204000	8209000	I want to do my own shit and they're like, we're doing circus this year.
8209000	8212000	I'm like, well, I'm doing nothing this year then.
8212000	8215000	I'm not fucking dressing up like circus.
8215000	8216000	You showed them.
8216000	8220000	They did Zoo last year and I dressed up in one of those inflatable T-Rex costumes.
8220000	8222000	So I think it's an animal.
8222000	8224000	All right. All right. Well, that's it.
8224000	8225000	We're done. We're out of here.
8225000	8227000	Have a great week, guys. We'll see you in seven days.
8227000	8231000	Jamie will be back here next week and it's episode number 750.
8231000	8237000	So we hope you'll join us here on another episode of our very, very, very, very, very long running video game podcast.
8237000	8239000	In the meantime, happy gaming.
8239000	8241000	Be cool to each other. Bye.
