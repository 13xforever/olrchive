WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:22.000
750 episodes, 750, that's a significant number and a heck of a lot of content from this music game turned all things gaming show.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
From us in NorCal straight to your ears, this is still the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back, it's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
This is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, episode number 750.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
750, just like Jason said in the intro there.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
For this, October the 28th of 2018.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
Happy Halloween y'all out there, since I know many folks are celebrating, you know, this weekend.

00:52.000 --> 01:01.000
Because Halloween's not really a lot of fun on a Wednesday, but maybe some of you guys will be trick-or-treating or maybe playing some scary games over the week, we'll see.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
Anyway, say hello to our co-hosts, welcome back to Studio Tonight.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
I know she's been on the show thanks to Radio Magic, but it's so nice to have her here in person during this work period.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Why do we call cookies cookies when you bake them?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Aren't they bakies?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Little bakies?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Bakies.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
I don't know.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Biscuits.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
And then it could be get baked off bakies.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Not these.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
By the way, this is a really funny story actually, I don't know, maybe it's not funny, but before we were on air tonight.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
So DarkSakura made cookies to bring to the show.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Anzac biscuits.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Which was very kind of you to do.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Bakies.

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
And then she said when she was explaining them to Loki, because Loki doesn't always eat every food you put in front of him.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I might as well just say hi to Tag Master Loki.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Hi, Loki.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Hi.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
So Loki doesn't always eat everything you put in front of him.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
He's what you call a picky eater, which is fine.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
I'm not picky, I just have a diet that I have.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
And cookies are a lot of calories.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
That's a convenient excuse.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
So anyway.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
I ate cookies yesterday, it's just, you know.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Alright, anyway, fine.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
They were soy cookies.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
Anyway, so DarkSakura, in explaining them to Loki, said they were special cookies.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
And I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
You put weed in these cookies?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
And DarkSakura goes, yeah.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Like totally without skipping a beat.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
And I'm like, Jamie, you're supposed to, like, you can't do that to your friends.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
I thought you said wheat.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Yeah, they're cookies.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
She thought I said wheat.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Like, yeah, they're cookies.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
They're made with flour.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I was like, why would you give me wheat cookies?

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
And not tell me, like, before the show.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
Because that's an awesome thing to do for episode 750.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
No, that's a horrible prank to play on your friends.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Don't do that.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
That's not nice.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
So I don't care if it's legal in California now.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Some people have issues.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Who could use a good stoning?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Anyway.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Jamie, how has the last month or so been treating you?

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Yeah, same TBH.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Same.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Anyway.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
It was a lot of pinball.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Really.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
I've been trying to play my theater of magic and get better at it.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Dan's like, cool, I could just show you everything.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
No, I want to learn it for myself.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
And finally I broke down and read the rule sheet.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
I keep forgetting.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
They do make, like, official rules for pinball, even though, like, very few of us have probably

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
ever seen them because they don't really exactly put them in arcades easily.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
Well, they might, like, hang them on the wall or something, but most people don't think

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
to look for them.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
You can get them now from the, like, the pinball internet database or something.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
The internet?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
The interwebs.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Anything is possible.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
And then Dan and I were watching the mini Games Done Quick from TwitchCon.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Yeah.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
That was pretty good.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
We watched the blindfold Symphony of the Night run.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Oh, that's fun.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
And just listening to the cues, though, I was like, I see how he's doing it.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
But you still have to have a good bit of memorization in on that one.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Have you picked up the Castlevania, like, combo pack?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
I forget the Requiem or whatever they called it.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Not yet.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
It's on the PS4.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Not yet.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
How do you feel about the fact that they use the newer voice acting as opposed to the classic?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
I don't mind.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Yeah?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
All right.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
I mean, the old one was cheeseball and great in its own light, but, you know, I really

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
don't mind.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Well, fair enough.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
I just wish that they would, like, do an HD version of the Saturn one.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
Yeah, that would be nice to use kind of like that as the base, even though it makes sense

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
because, you know, this PlayStation 4 that this back came out on, it makes sense.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
But yeah, I'd like to see the same one.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
I want to play through it as Richter or Maria.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
I've never gotten to play the game as Maria, so I would love to check that out.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Actually, we'll have to have you over to do a Saturn stream.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
That'll be fun.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
Of Nocturne in the Moonlight, which I still think is a better name than Symphony of the

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Night.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Yes, it would be a good time.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
Because it's the same as, you know, Rondo and Nocturne.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
They're the same type of thing instead of just a symphony.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
Go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
at the VoiceGeeks network, vognetwork.com.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Let's see.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
Fifth Dream says, I make cookies with coconuts, not wheat.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
But your-

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
These also have coconuts in them.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
They also say they have both.

05:03.000 --> 05:09.000
Actually, my dear friend JJ, who has been in the chat a few times, gave me this recipe

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
for Anzac cookies or biscuits that were, I think for World War II, that were made to

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
send off because they didn't need a lot of preservative or something.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Right.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
I'll have to find the official story again, but they're really delicious.

05:24.000 --> 05:31.000
They're made with coconut and rolled oats and golden syrup and baking soda.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Cooking with Sakura.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
Anyway, just to make sure I get the full plug in there so that Bobby gets his free plug.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the VoiceGeeks network, vognetwork.com,

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
that's vognetwork.com.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Some other comments in chat.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
MegamanX400, our pal Delvin, who was here about three weeks ago, says, come on, episode 750.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Woo, death drop.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
You missed a fun episode, not being able to be here when Delvin was here.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
It was a fun episode.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
It was very sad.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
I was also really sad that I was so sick the day before.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Oh, yeah.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
After brunch.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Oh, yeah.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
But we got to go.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
At least you got to meet him.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
We got to all go hang out and that was fun.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Yeah.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
It was good times.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Anyway, let's get into our video game kickoff topic.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
We actually have like a couple of smaller topics tonight.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
Well, first, I really actually, even before the kickoff topic, the pre-kickoff topic,

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
the singing of the national anthem part.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
Let's talk about the fact that we are episode 750.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I mean, it's kind of a landmark number.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
There's not a lot of gaming podcasts that have gotten this high in number.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Or have gotten this high in general.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
Well, here's the, if you want to get technical, if they're only weekly, I mean, we've been

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
running the longest since 2002, just about every week.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
I would say we miss one out of every eight shows or so just because, you know, sickness,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
holiday, whatever else comes up.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
But as far as pretty regularly weekly, we're the longest running.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
We know that.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
But there are other shows that maybe are twice a week, three times a week, or shows

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
that will do like a bunch of shows during E3 or PAX, like if they load up on interviews.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
So, you know, it kind of depends on how you're counting.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
So I would say there's a handful of gaming shows that have probably hit around 750 just

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
because they might do the multiple show thing, whether it's that they're multiple times a

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
week or what have you.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
But regardless, I mean, we've been doing this for 750 weeks off and on.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
So, I mean, what do you guys think?

07:25.000 --> 07:33.000
Like, how do things look now for gaming as opposed to when we first started?

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
Like, did you ever kind of think we'd be doing some of the stuff now with games?

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Did you ever think you'd be playing something like the games you're playing today, like

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
a DDR machine in your garage, Loki, when we first started our show way back on episode

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
one?

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
I didn't know if I'd...

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Yeah, sure.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
I thought I would have one by then.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Let's see.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Dark Sakura, did you ever think your pinball collection would be so big?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Kind of, yeah.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
Because I mean, keep in mind, it wasn't too long after we started the show that Dan started

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
collecting the pinball.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
I appreciate this here.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
Tabiri in chat says, you guys don't look a day over 500 episodes.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
That is so true.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
It really is.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Kind of taking a look down memory lane for a minute here, because I always think this

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
is kind of fun to see, like, well, what were we talking about back in the day?

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
And thankfully, we have a wiki that kind of like helps us out and we can go way back.

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
Now, unfortunately, like some episodes are so old that they haven't been like chronicled

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
in the wiki yet.

08:30.000 --> 08:37.000
But if I went back to say, if I went back to the to-go era, I think we did do an episode

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
50 in the to-go era.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Okay, here we go.

08:39.000 --> 08:46.000
So episode 50 of our to-go podcast was on December 12th of 2005, and it covered the

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Xbox 360 Japanese launch.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
Well, how do you how do you guys all think that went?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Space poncherific.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Well, well, you know what?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
They tried.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
They tried to Japan, probably more so than they did with the one, because they were trying

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
to, you know, team up with certain key players.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
That fact that they had Mistwalker with Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon was a thing, you know,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
they kind of tried.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
But I guess it just wasn't enough to really, you know, the Xbox 360 and Microsoft in general

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
just never really caught on in Japan.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
I think it's like kind of more of a niche thing.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
It still hasn't.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
No, and it still hasn't.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
You're right.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
It really hasn't.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Let's see.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
And yeah, Dartusuya says, those are the old shows.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I know many of the earlier episodes weren't archived.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
I probably have MP3s of almost all of them.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
I mean, there's there's some that are probably lost forever, but I have a good, good many

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
of them.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Let's see.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Going back to other nice big round numbers.

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
How about episode number 200 on September 17th of 2006?

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
We did Wii release date and price.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
So that's when we finally heard the when the Wii was coming out.

09:55.000 --> 10:01.000
Did you see that story this week, by the way, of the I guess they found a GameCube version

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
of the Wii controller.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Did you see that?

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
Like a prototype that so so when people were really developing for the Wii, it really was

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
a GameCube just duct taped to another GameCube in theory.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Let's see what else was on that episode.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
DDR power previews.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
I don't remember what that was.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
And then we did like we did an extra long episode that night because 200 was a big deal.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Let's see.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Let's go back to 250.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
I won't do every multiple 50.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
We'll cut a wrap here.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Episode 250.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
We not too big of a celebration.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
The wiki notes.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
But we hit the 250 episode mark.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
Stories included Halo DS.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
That was Halo DS was a thing.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
Yeah, there was a fan like indie fan game.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
I don't even remember that.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
OK, it was an indie fan game.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
OK, got it.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Well, actually, I don't know.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
It may have been something they were considering of developing.

10:52.000 --> 10:58.000
I remember I remember it vaguely, but like I don't remember if it was something like

10:58.000 --> 11:04.000
Microsoft was thinking about publishing this on the DS because they didn't have a platform

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
that was portable or if it was like, well, I remember they did something.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Some of the Viva Pinata stuff ended up on DS.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
So, yeah, so I think that may have been I remember there's like video of it and stuff.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
I don't know.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Let's see.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
And let's see.

11:18.000 --> 11:24.000
Eight bit the movie and episode number 250 was also the debut of Dark Sakura's classic

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
game of the week.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Before that, we hadn't done that before.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
You used to have other segments.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
You had like what was it?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Website of the week.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
And you had some advice column thing that you like.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Don't set yourself on fire.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
I don't remember what it was.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
It's like we should do an advice advice column again.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
You want to bring that back?

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
Yeah, maybe I should do like a Dear Abby thing on our website.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
It's called like Ask Dark Sakura.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
There you go.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Now, that's good content to bring people to our website.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
You should you should think about that.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Ask Dark Sakura some shit.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
All right.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
I love it.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Don't be an asshole.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Let's see.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Let's see.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
I'll do one more hand in chat.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
If you want me to do that.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
I'll do one more.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Let's see.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Going.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.640
Oh, you know, what's funny is it just if my screen froze for a minute on episode 285,

12:08.640 --> 12:10.880
that was the Tommy Tallarico week.

12:10.880 --> 12:11.880
That was when he came on.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.280
I bring that up because we had the television news last week.

12:14.280 --> 12:15.280
Forgot all about that.

12:15.280 --> 12:16.280
Yeah.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.280
Right.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.280
And I sort of remember that.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.280
But you don't remember when he came on the show.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.960
I sort of remember that six hour long show.

12:20.960 --> 12:25.920
You think the show is long usually that episode went all night.

12:25.920 --> 12:26.920
That man can talk.

12:26.920 --> 12:27.920
He can.

12:27.920 --> 12:28.920
He's great.

12:28.920 --> 12:29.920
He's just he loves what he does.

12:29.920 --> 12:30.920
What can you say?

12:30.920 --> 12:31.920
It's not a bad thing.

12:31.920 --> 12:32.920
Bring him on again.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.840
I will definitely send him an email as an invite, although it'll probably be better

12:35.840 --> 12:39.760
to get a little closer to when, you know, the Amico has a little more show.

12:39.760 --> 12:40.760
Sorry.

12:40.760 --> 12:45.080
When the show's over, Amico be out.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.080
Let's see.

12:46.080 --> 12:49.720
My my screen is freezing up over here, but let me see if I get because I'm on this ancient

12:49.720 --> 12:54.680
computer, which by the powers of Windows XP, I should say this, too.

12:54.680 --> 12:58.180
We're not going to be able to use Skype on this machine after next week.

12:58.180 --> 13:03.460
So tonight may be the last night you can use Skype to call into the show.

13:03.460 --> 13:04.460
I don't know yet.

13:04.460 --> 13:05.460
Or at least for a little bit.

13:05.460 --> 13:07.280
We have to just take a break from Skype.

13:07.280 --> 13:11.720
We have to see some other people for a little bit until we get the new computer and all

13:11.720 --> 13:13.480
that set up for the new studio.

13:13.480 --> 13:14.480
We'll see.

13:14.480 --> 13:15.480
All right.

13:15.480 --> 13:22.620
On the 500th episode of O.L.R., our Wiki says some features, some features of the original

13:22.620 --> 13:25.540
Wii are going offline.

13:25.540 --> 13:28.840
So episode 250 was the Wii is coming out.

13:28.840 --> 13:33.020
Episode 500 was the Wii is going offline.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.940
I don't know why that's so funny, but it is.

13:35.940 --> 13:40.940
And then Tomb Raider got a Japanese language pack for $30.

13:40.940 --> 13:44.740
So you could you could play the game in Japanese for a price.

13:44.740 --> 13:47.940
And I think that was a pretty big controversy that was going on at the time.

13:47.940 --> 13:50.180
And we did match game on episode 500.

13:50.180 --> 13:52.740
We haven't played one of our little games in quite some time.

13:52.740 --> 13:53.980
We used to be really known for those.

13:53.980 --> 13:54.980
We just kind of.

13:54.980 --> 13:58.320
I mean, without dark soccer being here regularly, we haven't really been able to do listless

13:58.320 --> 13:59.320
as much.

13:59.320 --> 14:02.900
And, you know, we used to do more of those games when our studio would really be full

14:02.900 --> 14:06.100
of people, because in the early days of O.L.R., especially like those years that you and I

14:06.100 --> 14:09.340
lived in that apartment, like I felt like we had like seven people on the show every

14:09.340 --> 14:10.340
week.

14:10.340 --> 14:11.340
It was nuts.

14:11.340 --> 14:12.340
So, yeah.

14:12.340 --> 14:15.860
So the games that Webcam with the one frame every ten seconds.

14:15.860 --> 14:16.860
Yeah.

14:16.860 --> 14:17.860
Now we're talking about moving back to Twitch.

14:17.860 --> 14:21.820
Y'all, for a while, you used to go you used to go to our Web site or it's not really a

14:21.820 --> 14:22.820
com.

14:22.820 --> 14:29.700
And we had a Webcam picture that would refresh once every like 15 seconds.

14:29.700 --> 14:30.700
Powers of the Internet.

14:30.700 --> 14:31.700
I know.

14:31.700 --> 14:32.700
Right.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.300
And now it's like, well, we're going back to it.

14:34.300 --> 14:35.300
What?

14:35.300 --> 14:37.260
The stream is only 30 frames per second.

14:37.260 --> 14:39.780
That's just terrible.

14:39.780 --> 14:40.780
I love it.

14:40.780 --> 14:41.780
All right.

14:41.780 --> 14:46.580
Anyhow, let's get into some kickoff topics for tonight.

14:46.580 --> 14:49.820
Let's talk about Nintendo Labo in schools.

14:49.820 --> 14:55.920
So Nintendo Labo is apparently going to be a part of some curriculums.

14:55.920 --> 15:00.260
They're saying Labo is going to be integrated in 100 U.S. classrooms throughout the current

15:00.260 --> 15:01.260
school year.

15:01.260 --> 15:07.100
This according to a Nintendo announcement with the nonprofit Institute of Play.

15:07.100 --> 15:11.800
Students in grades two through four are going to be able to build Labo projects focusing

15:11.800 --> 15:17.360
on the basic concept of STEAM, communication, creativity, critical thinking and problem

15:17.360 --> 15:18.640
solving.

15:18.640 --> 15:20.120
You can apply to join the program.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.200
If you happen to be a teacher, I know we actually have gamer teachers listen to the show.

15:23.200 --> 15:26.680
You go to the Institute of Play's Web site and you can be a part of this program.

15:26.680 --> 15:30.160
If you're selected, you get guidance from Nintendo and the Institute, a companion teacher

15:30.160 --> 15:35.040
guide that has a whole curriculum in it and the whole other like I guess the actual guide

15:35.040 --> 15:37.840
will be made available to free for anyone later in the year.

15:37.840 --> 15:38.840
So that's kind of cool.

15:38.840 --> 15:43.240
The Institute of Play does want to do a diverse group of schools around the U.S. urban, suburban,

15:43.240 --> 15:45.540
rural areas and so forth.

15:45.540 --> 15:49.400
So what do you guys think about Labo being used in the classroom?

15:49.400 --> 15:53.840
You know, I remember when Nintendo first announced Labo, it was kind of like, it kind of got

15:53.840 --> 15:56.480
some mixed reaction, I think, from the gamer fans.

15:56.480 --> 16:00.120
But I think there were definitely those of us that looked at that and said, well, it's

16:00.120 --> 16:02.840
not really meant to be a game.

16:02.840 --> 16:07.340
This is Nintendo's way to kind of find another niche in the toy market.

16:07.340 --> 16:09.920
This is kind of like the reverse of toys to games.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.380
It's games to toys.

16:11.380 --> 16:12.380
It's neat.

16:12.380 --> 16:17.580
It's like it reminds me of like those Lego, the robotic sets that they have, you know,

16:17.580 --> 16:22.820
where they do a lot of I've seen like different classes through, you know, could be schools

16:22.820 --> 16:27.220
or could be just like the most random one I've seen is they have this place called Bounce

16:27.220 --> 16:31.540
You, which is like one of those bounce house places that you go and jump on bounce houses

16:31.540 --> 16:33.620
for like an hour.

16:33.620 --> 16:38.420
But then they also do like this, like robotics camp or like night out thing where it's like

16:38.420 --> 16:43.180
you can drop your kids off and they build robots for using the Lego Mindstorm stuff.

16:43.180 --> 16:46.820
It's kind of like that, except it's Labo.

16:46.820 --> 16:47.820
And I don't know.

16:47.820 --> 16:54.660
I mean, granted, the software is pretty good, but I don't know how easy it is to create

16:54.660 --> 16:58.340
these new things versus like putting bricks together.

16:58.340 --> 16:59.340
Yeah.

16:59.340 --> 17:00.340
Yeah.

17:00.340 --> 17:06.660
So you've got a young kid, but like your kid is not quite at the age where they're doing

17:06.660 --> 17:10.620
this type of like educational gaming in the classroom yet, right?

17:10.620 --> 17:11.620
He plays.

17:11.620 --> 17:12.620
He has his own.

17:12.620 --> 17:17.060
Well, usually he would have his own Chromebook in the class.

17:17.060 --> 17:18.060
Oh, wow.

17:18.060 --> 17:20.900
So they do like something on that.

17:20.900 --> 17:26.520
I don't know what he does exactly on that, but like they do like typing and they earn

17:26.520 --> 17:32.000
credits doing things on there to play like educational games, I guess.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Like so long.

17:33.000 --> 17:41.040
So they can like he tends to save all of his credits, like play an hour of games at a time.

17:41.040 --> 17:43.040
OK, that's I guess that's good.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.600
He's learning investment early on.

17:44.600 --> 17:45.600
That's good.

17:45.600 --> 17:46.600
That's a good thing.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.440
So they have like Chromebooks and stuff in classes.

17:48.440 --> 17:49.440
OK.

17:49.440 --> 17:53.400
Because I just I remember, you know, back in my day when I was a kid, it was all about,

17:53.400 --> 17:56.040
you know, when we were in what, like the fourth grade?

17:56.080 --> 17:57.600
I think it wasn't until like the fourth grade.

17:57.600 --> 18:04.160
I remember going to the computer lab to play the Oregon Trail and number munchers.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.160
And I remember taking like a logo.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.480
I remember taking a nighttime class.

18:07.480 --> 18:10.520
It was about logo and that stuff was like an enrichment thing.

18:10.520 --> 18:14.440
I remember my dad went with me to something like that was like a turtle.

18:14.440 --> 18:15.440
Yeah.

18:15.440 --> 18:16.440
Logo was the turtle.

18:16.440 --> 18:17.440
It's like learning how to program.

18:17.440 --> 18:20.640
And so that way you think about flow charts and design and things like that.

18:20.640 --> 18:23.920
It's actually I don't think we ever got that far as more of like, OK, put these commands

18:23.920 --> 18:24.920
in.

18:24.920 --> 18:25.920
And what do you get?

18:25.920 --> 18:31.120
You know, it's like, OK, I go to our chat over at live dot vog network dot com.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.120
Let's see.

18:32.120 --> 18:36.200
Guys, you don't chat says the only way Labo is a good idea is if they give it to the school

18:36.200 --> 18:37.880
without making the teachers buy it.

18:37.880 --> 18:42.720
Well, I would assume if Nintendo is in on this, it's not something you have to buy it.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.880
I'm curious to see what it is like.

18:44.880 --> 18:48.200
The idea doesn't sound terrible, but it's just.

18:48.200 --> 18:53.800
I don't know, like if if it's just a software like some specific kits like, OK, here you

18:53.800 --> 18:55.200
can make this thing out of it.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.200
That's fine.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.400
That's kind of you can be creative and stuff with.

18:57.400 --> 19:03.360
But at the same time, like I think like it would be more intuitive, like for like Arduino

19:03.360 --> 19:08.860
or something like that, like, for example, someone we know, Mr. Punk Knight, you know,

19:08.860 --> 19:15.540
he is a teacher in middle school and he teaches computer science and stuff.

19:15.540 --> 19:21.120
And so he actually does like Arduino and robotics and 3D printing stuff in his class.

19:21.120 --> 19:22.120
Wow.

19:23.120 --> 19:31.560
You know, like that, if that was in like an elective when I was back in junior high, I

19:31.560 --> 19:32.560
would have taken that shit.

19:32.560 --> 19:37.440
I took the best I could do was American Technologies, which was like an engineering class and mechanical

19:37.440 --> 19:39.720
drawing, which, you know, is like drafting.

19:39.720 --> 19:44.080
So we didn't have any sort of my elective, like all throughout high school was banned,

19:44.080 --> 19:45.640
which I mean, I don't regret.

19:45.640 --> 19:46.640
Yeah.

19:46.640 --> 19:50.520
You're a fellow band geek to Bobby Blackwell's, a fellow band geek, like, you know, us band

19:50.520 --> 19:51.800
geeks turned out OK.

19:51.800 --> 19:57.600
And I think still kind of have a lot of a lot of overlap with gaming and all that stuff.

19:57.600 --> 20:01.360
Remember, it ain't a party until the contract contract to a clarinet player shows up.

20:01.360 --> 20:05.480
Well, I mean, there's a reason that there was that running joke in that movie American

20:05.480 --> 20:12.440
Pie where at this one time at band camp, because it's all true, you know, nerds were freaks.

20:12.440 --> 20:15.880
We didn't have like a camp that you went to like that.

20:15.880 --> 20:20.080
We had a swamp in the backfield at school that we would just march in.

20:20.080 --> 20:21.080
Oh, we had band camp.

20:21.080 --> 20:24.040
But it wasn't like it wasn't like you went away for three days.

20:24.040 --> 20:25.040
It was band camp.

20:25.040 --> 20:29.640
Well, my quote fingers was that three days, like a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday before

20:29.640 --> 20:33.340
the school semester started, you only three days.

20:33.340 --> 20:35.280
I think it was only three days or two weeks.

20:35.280 --> 20:36.280
Wow.

20:36.280 --> 20:39.720
That's well, we did the three days and then we also did like one night a week through

20:39.720 --> 20:42.640
the rest of the year, like an extra like field practices.

20:42.640 --> 20:46.900
That's how we learned the field shows, basically, you know, which the field show and band is

20:46.900 --> 20:49.200
when they do all those little patterns out on the football field.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.200
You guys have all seen that before.

20:50.320 --> 20:51.680
Yeah, no, we did.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.320
We did two weeks.

20:53.320 --> 20:58.200
There was like marching fundamentals and then we would learn the show and memorize a lot

20:58.200 --> 21:03.880
of our music, which I mean, it's well, this show did start as a music gaming show.

21:03.880 --> 21:08.100
And I think like music games in some ways, I don't want to say it was really like the

21:08.100 --> 21:11.640
gateway that got me into games because I was playing games before music games like still

21:11.640 --> 21:14.120
waiting for sex maniacs.

21:14.120 --> 21:16.920
Music games really made me love video games in a whole nother way.

21:16.920 --> 21:18.640
I don't know if that makes sense.

21:19.080 --> 21:24.040
Kind of made me finally make sitar hero and actually there wasn't like a real game.

21:24.040 --> 21:28.480
It was a flash game on the love guru website for that terrible movie.

21:28.480 --> 21:29.600
I know, but it was still funny.

21:29.600 --> 21:30.720
Yeah, sitar hero.

21:30.720 --> 21:31.240
Exactly.

21:31.240 --> 21:32.240
How long do we joke about it?

21:34.040 --> 21:38.680
So, I mean, what would you guys like to what do you guys think gaming could do?

21:38.680 --> 21:41.160
And I open this up to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

21:41.160 --> 21:46.120
It doesn't just have to be Labo, but what types of games do you think could help people

21:46.120 --> 21:46.640
learn?

21:46.760 --> 21:52.120
What do you think are some good like learning types of games that kids could be playing?

21:52.120 --> 21:55.920
You know, when I was in junior high school, we used to just kind of on our lunch, we used

21:55.920 --> 21:58.720
to play, um, scorched earth.

21:58.720 --> 22:00.200
I was thinking the same thing.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.200
Yes.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.200
Right.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.200
Do you remember that scorcher?

22:03.200 --> 22:05.560
And that's when you would learn about angles and velocity.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.640
So everybody's played a game like scorched earth.

22:07.640 --> 22:11.080
I'm sure like years ago there was another, it was a tank wars was the other big one that

22:11.080 --> 22:15.760
used to, which is basically all of these games, worms, like, right.

22:15.760 --> 22:20.360
Worms is kind of like, but worms now you could like move the worms and you wouldn't really

22:20.360 --> 22:21.360
do that.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.360
And scorched earth.

22:22.360 --> 22:23.360
I guess that's right.

22:23.360 --> 22:25.160
You get like little developments for the tanks and you can move them.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.160
Right.

22:26.160 --> 22:30.360
So anyway, those like scorched earth was all about being able to like shoot the nuke over

22:30.360 --> 22:33.720
the hill and you got to get the right velocity and angle.

22:33.720 --> 22:34.720
And it was actually kind of fun.

22:34.720 --> 22:35.720
Like, I don't know.

22:35.720 --> 22:39.520
Like, I feel like we learned a lot playing that game, but like our science teacher used

22:39.520 --> 22:42.920
to love to let us come in and use the computers to play scorched earth on lunch.

22:42.920 --> 22:43.920
He thought it was hilarious.

22:43.920 --> 22:44.920
So, yeah.

22:44.920 --> 22:45.920
Yeah.

22:45.920 --> 22:48.800
I mean, I don't know what they could play.

22:48.800 --> 22:53.320
I mean, I know that Minecraft has its own, like they have a whole programming thing that

22:53.320 --> 22:57.880
you can do with Minecraft as well, cause they're all redstone stuff.

22:57.880 --> 23:02.560
So they actually have like a coding Minecraft thing.

23:02.560 --> 23:03.560
I mean, I don't know.

23:03.560 --> 23:08.880
I think like there could be other tools that they could make that be able to do like something

23:09.200 --> 23:13.640
I don't really know what we're trying to teach our children is what I'm thinking.

23:13.640 --> 23:16.360
You know, a lot of it's just like, depends on the age.

23:16.360 --> 23:22.120
Like right now, you know, it's more of like typing skills, you know, maybe like a second

23:22.120 --> 23:23.120
language.

23:23.120 --> 23:26.960
Do they teach your kids how to write as much as they teach them how to type?

23:26.960 --> 23:29.640
They teach them how to write more than typing.

23:29.640 --> 23:34.600
Typing's more of like, here, here's your login to this, you know, typing site.

23:34.600 --> 23:37.440
Cause I would swear that cursive is going to become a lost art.

23:37.440 --> 23:40.400
I would like being able to write cursive, like that seems like the type of thing that

23:40.400 --> 23:43.680
like in like 30 years, I don't know.

23:43.680 --> 23:46.840
Maybe I'm, maybe I'm just being crazy, but like, is it just me, but it seemed like cursive

23:46.840 --> 23:47.840
is one of those things.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.240
How often do you write in cursive?

23:49.240 --> 23:51.000
When I sign my name.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Yeah.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
When I sign my name, that's it.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.420
When I sign my name, I write in cursive.

23:54.420 --> 23:55.880
Do you ever write in cursive, Darksira?

23:55.880 --> 23:56.880
All the time actually.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.200
Of course she does.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.200
Of course.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.200
Of course she does.

24:00.200 --> 24:01.200
It's always Jamie when there's something.

24:01.200 --> 24:05.680
I was writing cursive before it was popular.

24:05.700 --> 24:07.800
She used her hammer and chisel to do it.

24:07.800 --> 24:13.560
Well, no, but I'm also going back and trying to learn proper calligraphy because I mean,

24:13.560 --> 24:17.040
to me it's, it is kind of an art form.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.660
I could see it as like an art.

24:18.660 --> 24:21.520
If you have an artistic interest in absolutely like cursive and calligraphy.

24:21.520 --> 24:25.260
I'm not trying to like slam cursive, but I'm just saying like in the real world, how often

24:25.260 --> 24:26.920
do you use cursive outside of signing your name?

24:26.920 --> 24:27.920
Because now it's typing.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.180
You got to know how to type.

24:29.180 --> 24:30.180
You have to know how to type.

24:30.180 --> 24:34.640
Well, when I, when I hand take notes, it's actually kind of funny because sometimes I

24:34.640 --> 24:40.680
will switch in between using cursive and script in the middle of my notes or writing

24:40.680 --> 24:45.860
letters or I'll combine the letters cause they're easier to hand write in cursive than

24:45.860 --> 24:49.760
they are in print, especially after, you know, having three hand surgeries.

24:49.760 --> 24:54.840
Although I also will sometimes find that I've started writing my notes backwards.

24:54.840 --> 24:59.120
I mean complete backwards mirror image cause I can do that and it happens sometimes.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.120
Okay.

25:00.120 --> 25:01.680
Hey word.

25:02.000 --> 25:07.480
Bob coffee and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says educational games should also teach critical

25:07.480 --> 25:11.000
thinking because a lot of today's kids are fucking morons.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.760
Well, that seems to be a very broad stroke, but yes, they do need to teach critical thinking.

25:15.760 --> 25:19.380
I mean, I was just thinking the other day about like, are we teaching our kids in schools

25:19.380 --> 25:24.120
how to spot fake shit on social media and how to like, like, like seriously, like I

25:24.120 --> 25:27.160
don't mean to get all like political, but like I would think in this day and age you

25:27.160 --> 25:31.280
want to teach people at a young age how to spot fake shit online because there's a lot

25:31.280 --> 25:32.280
of it.

25:32.280 --> 25:37.000
I think that they should go back instead of making like debate part of, you know, like

25:37.000 --> 25:40.800
an extracurricular thing or making it part of like a particular class.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.560
They should teach rhetoric.

25:42.560 --> 25:49.000
Now, the communication class that I was in was like a group debate class in college,

25:49.000 --> 25:55.940
but he, my, my, uh, my professors actually had his masters in rhetoric and part of what

25:55.940 --> 26:00.640
rhetoric teaches is how to decide what is a fallacious argument.

26:00.640 --> 26:06.800
You know, how to point out when you're heading into a fallacy like slippery slope argument,

26:06.800 --> 26:11.100
straw man arguments, you know, let me, let me steer us back on course a little bit because

26:11.100 --> 26:13.480
even though this is a good conversation, it is games.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.280
Something that should be taught.

26:15.280 --> 26:17.720
Is there a way we could use games to do that?

26:17.720 --> 26:18.800
There could be games for that.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.640
There could be, you know, spot the fallacy.

26:20.640 --> 26:25.900
I mean, I would play a game like that because I do that all the time anyway on Facebook.

26:25.900 --> 26:26.900
You do it for free.

26:26.900 --> 26:27.900
I do it for free.

26:27.900 --> 26:28.900
Why not make a game out of it?

26:28.900 --> 26:31.240
That's like a high score for pointing out idiocy.

26:31.240 --> 26:38.940
I remember playing a game on my Commodore 64 that was about running for president and

26:38.940 --> 26:42.980
the things you had to do in different states to get electoral votes.

26:42.980 --> 26:46.140
And it taught you like by playing this game, it taught you about like how the electoral

26:46.140 --> 26:47.380
college worked and all that.

26:47.380 --> 26:51.360
And look, I know that's a controversial thing, but it's the, it's the way it is.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.400
So you should learn about it.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.700
You should learn how your government works, whether you agree with it or not, right?

26:55.700 --> 26:58.460
So like this game on the Commodore, like taught me about all that.

26:58.460 --> 27:01.500
And I think, you know, those, those are the types of things that I think are really cool

27:01.500 --> 27:06.020
when a game sort of helps you, like a video game helps you learn some of these more like

27:06.020 --> 27:11.620
complex things like, like in history and all that, um, especially, uh, where in the world

27:11.620 --> 27:12.620
is Carmen Sandiego?

27:12.620 --> 27:15.780
Well, especially the further down the road you went with those games was great.

27:15.780 --> 27:16.780
Yeah.

27:16.780 --> 27:18.640
Where in time you started to really learn historical things.

27:18.640 --> 27:22.980
Same thing with, um, where in, uh, I think there was where in the USA, where in the world

27:22.980 --> 27:26.100
and there was another one, I don't remember what it was like.

27:26.100 --> 27:31.020
I felt like the more they went, the more, I guess it was, there was more you would actually

27:31.020 --> 27:34.860
learn about like history and the earth, but now it's kind of hard to go back and play

27:34.860 --> 27:39.940
this because I actually tried like to pick up, you know, where in the world and it was

27:39.940 --> 27:44.260
because our geography has changed so much and you know, some of those countries don't

27:44.260 --> 27:46.260
even exist anymore.

27:46.260 --> 27:50.300
It's something that you absolutely update and keep that series fresh.

27:50.300 --> 27:52.300
Our chat rooms lighting up with some great comments.

27:52.300 --> 27:54.940
I can't read these all, but you guys are having a good discussion in there.

27:54.940 --> 27:55.940
Thank you.

27:55.980 --> 27:59.660
And looking at chat at live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwell started off mentioning the

27:59.660 --> 28:04.180
Assassin's Creed origins had the educational version where you'd learn about Egyptian mythology.

28:04.180 --> 28:06.980
That was kind of a recent thing and I thought that was, Oh yeah, that was kind of like a

28:06.980 --> 28:08.740
neat little side thing you could do.

28:08.740 --> 28:14.060
I did actually bring this up when Assassin's Creed two was out that my art history teacher

28:14.060 --> 28:20.460
used screenshots from Assassin's Creed two to talk about Renaissance Italy because it

28:20.460 --> 28:26.300
actually had a very, as she put it, a very accurate layout of what, uh, you know, the

28:26.300 --> 28:29.780
Vatican was supposed to be like then or however it was and where all these buildings were

28:29.780 --> 28:30.780
laid out.

28:30.780 --> 28:31.780
Right.

28:31.780 --> 28:32.780
Yeah.

28:32.780 --> 28:35.260
I would imagine Assassin's Creed has a lot of value in teaching art history, you know,

28:35.260 --> 28:38.500
because when the designers make this game, they immerse themselves in it.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.780
They have to teach themselves about all of this.

28:40.780 --> 28:45.680
So I just remember reading about how, um, for whatever this last one that came out was

28:45.680 --> 28:50.960
where they were actually having to go in and study like Spartan and Greek, uh, Odyssey

28:50.960 --> 28:56.280
the Greek Odyssey is the Greek one, the, um, lifestyles so that they could accurately do

28:56.280 --> 28:57.280
costumes.

28:57.280 --> 29:01.600
Now, some of them they had to tweak, you know, to make them work, but where they were going

29:01.600 --> 29:05.880
in and trying to make them as historically accurate as they could possibly be.

29:05.880 --> 29:07.960
And they were consulting with historians.

29:07.960 --> 29:10.200
And I think that we need more of that.

29:10.200 --> 29:14.020
I want to read one more comment in chat because I think this is important and then we'll go

29:14.020 --> 29:17.220
on to another kickoff topic we have, cause this was supposed to be a short one, but it's

29:17.220 --> 29:18.220
a good discussion.

29:18.220 --> 29:22.000
Uh, SG100 Matt says, my girlfriend is a school teacher and her feeling is that it's hard

29:22.000 --> 29:25.600
to make a game for kids that will get them engaged in it.

29:25.600 --> 29:28.980
Part of the reason is that kids are smart and know when they're trying to be catered

29:28.980 --> 29:30.180
to.

29:30.180 --> 29:33.700
Games that are overly educational seem lame to a lot of kids.

29:33.700 --> 29:38.260
It's all about hitting those things that kids like about games and helping them to retain

29:38.260 --> 29:40.700
the knowledge they learn from a game.

29:40.700 --> 29:42.480
How I, and that brings up a good point.

29:42.480 --> 29:45.660
How do you make educational games not lame?

29:45.660 --> 29:50.240
What was it about things like number munchers and Oregon Trail from our era?

29:50.240 --> 29:53.520
What made those games cool to play that didn't feel lame?

29:53.520 --> 29:54.520
I'll say this.

29:54.520 --> 29:59.160
I think in Oregon Trail, what made that game like not lame was that you had that whole

29:59.160 --> 30:00.360
little side thing.

30:00.360 --> 30:03.520
Well, not only cause your friends die of dysentery, that was huge, right?

30:03.520 --> 30:05.760
You would put in like your friends and your frenemies.

30:05.760 --> 30:10.480
So like you put in like dark Sakura and then like somewhere along the line, like dark Sakura,

30:10.480 --> 30:14.040
you know, and you try to Ford the river and dark Sakura drowns and you laugh cause your

30:14.040 --> 30:15.040
friend drowned.

30:15.040 --> 30:16.040
Even though it's kind of morbid.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.040
Sorry, dark Sakura.

30:17.040 --> 30:18.960
But she's done it to me, I'm sure.

30:18.960 --> 30:23.700
So anyway, but there's also those sequences where like you would go hunting for the Buffalo.

30:23.700 --> 30:25.760
And so that was like the arcade part of the games.

30:25.760 --> 30:30.480
It was like they made a little like, like arcade ish, which, you know, not that the

30:30.480 --> 30:34.280
shooting game was that complicated, but it was reminiscent of Atari.

30:34.280 --> 30:37.380
Number munchers was kind of like that number of munchers really felt like you were playing

30:37.380 --> 30:38.380
an arcade game.

30:38.380 --> 30:39.380
Yeah.

30:39.380 --> 30:43.840
It was like the arcade and back then, yeah, the quality was like, this is basically just

30:43.840 --> 30:47.360
a game, but you know, it's education based type.

30:47.360 --> 30:50.920
And so maybe, you know, kind of piggybacking on what dark Sakura said a minute ago about,

30:50.920 --> 30:53.280
you know, the assassin's creed and all that.

30:53.280 --> 30:56.520
And somebody in chat brought up the fact that there's actually historical notes that you

30:56.520 --> 30:58.600
can look at as you're playing assassin's creed.

30:58.600 --> 31:04.160
Maybe that's one way to do it is to kind of put a little more education in the games that

31:04.160 --> 31:05.160
we already enjoy.

31:05.160 --> 31:07.160
I don't know.

31:07.940 --> 31:11.340
I, I really want to see more things like that happen.

31:11.340 --> 31:16.340
And on top of that too, now, and there's people who are going to argue against this, but I'd

31:16.340 --> 31:23.860
like to see a lot more social commentary in games as in, you know, illustrate what terrible

31:23.860 --> 31:30.580
things happened in the past, you know, basic game around, you know, tragic events, you

31:30.580 --> 31:35.500
know, not necessarily to make light of those events, but to bring light to those events.

31:35.840 --> 31:39.520
Because, I mean, you've got a lot of people who are now trying to deny certain things

31:39.520 --> 31:44.680
in history happened and doing revisionist history, when the phrase still stands, those

31:44.680 --> 31:46.600
who forget history are doomed to repeat it.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.800
Hello world right now.

31:48.800 --> 31:53.360
You know, I think that we really should have a lot more historical commentary in light

31:53.360 --> 31:54.600
of what goes on today.

31:54.600 --> 31:55.600
You know what?

31:55.600 --> 31:59.200
That's one thing I always really liked about Gamer X, you know, the years that that was

31:59.200 --> 32:00.200
around.

32:00.220 --> 32:06.820
It wasn't just necessarily like LGBTQ plus type games, but I felt like there were a lot

32:06.820 --> 32:09.340
of games that had something to say with social commentary with them.

32:09.340 --> 32:14.100
I feel like that era, like when we were attending, you know, that show, we saw a lot of games

32:14.100 --> 32:17.940
that were coming out that were not just, you know, games from a perspective, like the,

32:17.940 --> 32:21.700
the fragments of him or something, which allows you to experience, you know, a story, you

32:21.700 --> 32:24.900
know, from a different perspective that might not be yours.

32:24.900 --> 32:28.140
But I remember playing this game that was like a puzzle game and it was about trying

32:28.160 --> 32:34.560
to arrange three people sleeping on a bed because it was kind of a social commentary.

32:34.560 --> 32:38.080
And I'm not saying it's a social, you have to agree with it or you don't agree with it.

32:38.080 --> 32:41.840
It's a reflection of a social commentary on triad relationships.

32:41.840 --> 32:46.240
You know, whether you get it or not, this is some people's lives, right?

32:46.240 --> 32:47.240
Absolutely.

32:47.240 --> 32:52.040
Um, you know, and things like, and I know, I know this game carries a lot of other weight

32:52.040 --> 32:56.920
out there, but if you look at the game isolated by itself, a game like Depression Quest, why

32:56.920 --> 33:01.300
did that game have the social impact that it did?

33:01.300 --> 33:05.800
And ultimately this whole other, whoo, they came up as a result, right?

33:05.800 --> 33:10.100
But I mean, if you go back to just the game itself, which was a text adventure game, it

33:10.100 --> 33:15.880
was a social commentary on this thing that not everybody is necessarily experienced.

33:15.880 --> 33:19.460
And it was a way for you to kind of like put yourself in the shoes.

33:19.460 --> 33:23.920
And I think a lot of our problems in the world would be solved if we could just walk in somebody

33:23.920 --> 33:25.540
else's shoes for a little bit.

33:26.440 --> 33:27.440
Not all of them.

33:27.440 --> 33:32.760
Basic empathy is something that a lot of people lack and it's not encouraged for people to

33:32.760 --> 33:34.400
have on top of that.

33:34.400 --> 33:39.920
If we had a little bit more focus on being able to relate and being empathetic to other

33:39.920 --> 33:45.660
people, I'm positive we wouldn't have, well, actually I'm even going to go another layer

33:45.660 --> 33:46.660
beyond that.

33:46.660 --> 33:51.960
If history were accurately taught, you know, I was lucky enough that I had teachers who

33:51.960 --> 33:55.500
would say, okay, this in your history book, it's wrong, here's what happened.

33:55.500 --> 34:01.240
If you had more people who were willing to step away from a curriculum and actually teach

34:01.240 --> 34:04.520
real things, yes, this is what really happened.

34:04.520 --> 34:08.780
Yeah, your book says this, but really these people came in and killed all these people

34:08.780 --> 34:09.780
or this happened.

34:09.780 --> 34:14.280
It wasn't just, you know, friendly handshake and everyone was, you know, suddenly pals,

34:14.280 --> 34:15.280
you know.

34:15.280 --> 34:20.680
I think that those things need to be taught younger and younger and then teach about,

34:20.680 --> 34:25.660
you know, where empathy comes in, the good that comes from being a compassionate human

34:25.660 --> 34:31.300
being so that it can hopefully, well, and on top of that to teach proper sexual education

34:31.300 --> 34:36.360
so that we don't have a bunch of asshole rapists who don't know where babies come from.

34:36.360 --> 34:41.040
You know, it's, it's just this cult of stupidity that people are fostering.

34:41.040 --> 34:47.200
And I honestly think that our video games could play such a role in combating that.

34:47.200 --> 34:49.940
Really make them, make them fun, but put the lesson in.

34:49.940 --> 34:53.860
If you've got to be sneaky about it, fucking be sneaky, but put it in there.

34:53.860 --> 34:54.860
All right.

34:54.860 --> 34:58.180
A good note to end on with that topic, but we can probably spend three hours talking

34:58.180 --> 35:01.060
about this topic alone, but great discussion and thanks everybody in our chat.

35:01.060 --> 35:03.900
I have another kickoff topic before we get to our gaming week because there's two things

35:03.900 --> 35:04.900
I wanted to bring.

35:04.900 --> 35:05.900
I thought that would be a short one.

35:05.900 --> 35:07.620
I didn't think we'd have a lot to say, but who knew?

35:07.620 --> 35:11.820
I want to also talk about TwitchCon because TwitchCon happened this past weekend.

35:11.820 --> 35:15.460
I'm really heartbroken I couldn't go because it was just two hours away, but there was

35:15.460 --> 35:19.900
so much going on this weekend that was just, it was quite frankly, with all due respect,

35:19.900 --> 35:22.060
more important than TwitchCon.

35:22.060 --> 35:27.460
For example, yesterday was Captain Spike from gameboo.org got married.

35:27.460 --> 35:33.640
So congratulations and all that to him and his new husband and wish them all the best.

35:33.640 --> 35:39.060
But also I hosted Rocky Horror last night, which is why my voice is a little bit eh today,

35:39.060 --> 35:41.160
because there was all that going on.

35:41.160 --> 35:44.020
So unfortunately I couldn't get to TwitchCon just because I had these other things going

35:44.020 --> 35:48.180
on, but I was certainly watching from home and I was looking at all the pictures and

35:48.180 --> 35:52.340
experiencing big time missing out syndrome, but it happens.

35:52.340 --> 35:55.200
But then I also was listening about some of the announcements.

35:55.200 --> 35:59.020
And I know as somebody who has done some streaming on Twitch and hopes to do more with this show

35:59.020 --> 36:02.820
on Twitch in the future, I was very curious what they had to say with some of the announcements.

36:02.820 --> 36:05.540
One of the biggest announcements they made at the Twitch keynote was that there will

36:05.540 --> 36:08.220
be a squad stream feature.

36:08.220 --> 36:13.420
In a nutshell, it's Mixer's co-stream feature finally making its way over to Twitch.

36:13.420 --> 36:15.020
The Minute Mixer unleashed that.

36:15.020 --> 36:18.580
We were kind of wondering how long before Twitch does something like that.

36:18.580 --> 36:19.580
Here we are.

36:19.580 --> 36:24.820
So you'll be able to stream with up to four people in a single view, which when you go

36:24.820 --> 36:28.100
to any of the channels, you will see basically the quad view.

36:28.100 --> 36:30.820
The chat is all linked, which I think is pretty cool.

36:30.820 --> 36:31.820
Oh no, I'm sorry.

36:31.820 --> 36:33.820
Chat is linked to whatever channel is your main view.

36:33.820 --> 36:38.640
So you can kind of go to, you know, camera one, camera two, whatever you want to do.

36:38.640 --> 36:39.640
Select streamers.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.500
They say, well, we get to test this out later this year.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.100
They're doing changes to the highlight editor.

36:43.420 --> 36:47.580
So you could do like multiple moments in one highlight as opposed to just like everything

36:47.580 --> 36:48.780
having to happen all in a row.

36:48.780 --> 36:51.100
It just sounds like you kind of like string your clips together.

36:51.100 --> 36:53.700
It just kind of sounds like an improvement there.

36:53.700 --> 36:57.020
This sounds really exciting for discoverability for those of us that are a little more up

36:57.020 --> 36:58.020
and coming.

36:58.020 --> 37:04.940
The Twitch homepage plans to feature new partners and affiliates, streamers local to the viewer,

37:04.940 --> 37:10.100
which is kind of interesting, up and coming streamers, which again was something Mixer

37:10.100 --> 37:12.500
did that I always kind of liked.

37:12.500 --> 37:17.340
Understanding how this competition is now kind of causing some developments.

37:17.340 --> 37:19.300
That's kind of cool.

37:19.300 --> 37:22.780
And then they're also talking about VIP badges is going to be something new so you can actually

37:22.780 --> 37:25.480
make somebody a VIP member of your community.

37:25.480 --> 37:29.700
So like if somebody maybe doesn't have the dollars to be able to subscribe, you can make

37:29.700 --> 37:34.060
them, depending on how much you stream, you can make so many VIP members and they get

37:34.060 --> 37:35.060
a special acknowledgement.

37:35.060 --> 37:37.260
They get a special badge just for being there.

37:37.260 --> 37:40.760
It's like a, you know, a VIP, somebody that is always there and supporting you.

37:40.760 --> 37:44.240
And I know there's a few people I would definitely like want to give this to.

37:44.240 --> 37:45.760
Some good moderator tools.

37:45.760 --> 37:49.480
This is more for the big channels that are consistently having to timeout, kick, ban

37:49.480 --> 37:50.480
people.

37:50.480 --> 37:51.480
This will allow them to keep that.

37:51.480 --> 37:53.120
Like it's basically like we can keep notes.

37:53.120 --> 37:57.520
So like, you know, let's say, you know, we can make a note on Bobby Black Wolf's file

37:57.520 --> 38:02.680
that like he was starting an argument about Chrono Trigger versus Super Metroid.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.760
And I had to give him a timeout for five minutes.

38:04.760 --> 38:07.120
I can make a note in the file there.

38:07.120 --> 38:10.720
So that way, like going in your permanent record, I'm putting this in your record,

38:10.720 --> 38:11.680
Bobby.

38:11.680 --> 38:14.760
And then that way, if somebody saw that later on, like, oh, he's doing it again.

38:14.760 --> 38:17.680
That's strike two, you know, or whatever we could, we could make notes on that.

38:17.680 --> 38:21.760
So I don't even have IRC open at the moment as I'm reading.

38:21.760 --> 38:26.640
I don't even want to see what Bobby's screaming in chat in response to that.

38:26.640 --> 38:27.640
Let's see.

38:27.640 --> 38:32.040
Uh, also for subscribers, you get to see exactly how long, uh, without it necessarily being

38:32.040 --> 38:33.240
consecutive months.

38:33.240 --> 38:37.120
And then I think the other big thing is with extensions, they're partnering with Snapchat

38:37.120 --> 38:38.120
and the snap camera.

38:38.640 --> 38:43.120
So you can do Snapchat filters on your Twitch stream, which sounds a little silly.

38:43.120 --> 38:47.720
Like I have no need for those types of things, but I guess if maybe you're more of a social

38:47.720 --> 38:53.520
ask me anything fun channel or whatever, then maybe you have a little more use for these.

38:53.520 --> 38:58.260
But I think it's a little bit silly myself, but Loki, would you use some Snapchat filters

38:58.260 --> 38:59.520
as you play DDR?

38:59.520 --> 39:00.760
I don't think that would work well.

39:00.760 --> 39:03.800
Make yourself a little puppy dog face as you're dancing.

39:03.800 --> 39:07.800
I think that would be all sorts of broken, but yeah, sure.

39:07.800 --> 39:11.960
One last thing, uh, the bounty board is going to be expanding.

39:11.960 --> 39:16.800
So certain affiliates and partners get to use the bounty board to earn more money.

39:16.800 --> 39:21.140
And I think this really, it really sounds like game companies that are willing to give

39:21.140 --> 39:25.880
you like a copy of the game and even maybe some kit back, some ad dollars basically for

39:25.880 --> 39:28.920
playing the game, not being negative on it.

39:28.920 --> 39:33.920
Like the, the little screenshot example that they show says Assassin's Creed Odyssey brought

39:33.960 --> 39:38.800
to you by Ubisoft game key included with bounty activation.

39:38.800 --> 39:42.440
And then basically, uh, you have to stream it for an hour straight with an average of

39:42.440 --> 39:43.820
a certain amount of viewers.

39:43.820 --> 39:46.720
If you don't hit the average, you get a proportional percentage of the payout.

39:46.720 --> 39:48.260
So that's kind of interesting.

39:48.260 --> 39:51.420
It says no needless bad mouthing of the content.

39:51.420 --> 39:54.000
Be sure to engage with the content in your community.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.700
And then you have a bounties widget and you have to turn on the past broadcasts and so

39:58.700 --> 39:59.700
on and so on.

39:59.700 --> 40:03.440
So like they're not telling you what to say, but they, you know, it makes sense if the

40:03.440 --> 40:07.760
company's going to be sponsoring you, you can't just sit there and bag on what a terrible

40:07.760 --> 40:12.960
game and necessarily, yeah, it has to be criticism with purpose basically, but I would think

40:12.960 --> 40:17.960
if you're doing one of these, you do have a responsibility to disclose, Hey guys, uh,

40:17.960 --> 40:21.840
we're checking out a bounty provided to us by Assassin's Creed and Ubisoft today.

40:21.840 --> 40:23.960
So I wanted to check this game out with y'all.

40:23.960 --> 40:24.960
Let's take a look.

40:24.960 --> 40:29.520
You know, you want to disclose, it's an ad basically hashtag ad, right?

40:29.520 --> 40:30.520
I do it.

40:30.520 --> 40:31.520
Yeah.

40:31.520 --> 40:32.520
I think that sounds kind of exciting.

40:32.600 --> 40:38.760
It'll be, it'll be interesting to see, um, uh, what levels they kind of let people participate

40:38.760 --> 40:39.760
that with.

40:39.760 --> 40:43.960
So, um, Bobby Black Wolf in chat is actually mentioning on a serious note.

40:43.960 --> 40:47.200
I mean, he's, he's poking fun at the chrono trigger thing, but on a serious note says

40:47.200 --> 40:51.160
I had total FOMO fear of missing out on not going to TwitchCon.

40:51.160 --> 40:55.360
When do we squad stream Forza Horizon 4, uh, day one that it's out.

40:55.360 --> 41:00.160
The only problem is you're going to be competing with Delvin and I streaming Mario Kart 8.

41:00.160 --> 41:02.400
So that's going to be a big week.

41:03.280 --> 41:04.280
Yeah.

41:04.280 --> 41:05.280
That'd be five.

41:05.280 --> 41:06.280
I'm just gonna make it a point to stream.

41:06.280 --> 41:07.280
Nothing new.

41:07.280 --> 41:09.080
Well, there's nothing wrong with playing retro titles.

41:09.080 --> 41:10.080
It's old.

41:10.080 --> 41:11.080
Why not?

41:11.080 --> 41:12.280
I want like, not like old, old.

41:12.280 --> 41:15.200
I want like PS one era.

41:15.200 --> 41:16.200
Go for it.

41:16.200 --> 41:18.000
I think there's people that will watch it.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.720
I have been thinking about switching up to fourth plus on my machine and I was like,

41:21.720 --> 41:24.160
you know, once I do that, I've got invite Rob over.

41:24.160 --> 41:25.160
Yeah.

41:25.160 --> 41:26.160
Heck yeah.

41:26.160 --> 41:27.160
Heck yeah.

41:27.160 --> 41:28.160
I want to play some fourth plus.

41:28.160 --> 41:29.160
Yeah.

41:29.160 --> 41:30.160
We need to do it.

41:30.160 --> 41:31.160
We may.

41:31.160 --> 41:32.160
We need to do like an OLR midweek stream.

41:32.920 --> 41:33.920
I want to do like, I'm so disappointed.

41:33.920 --> 41:38.040
Like, cause I always have to carry the brunt of the kids, but next week they're doing the

41:38.040 --> 41:41.920
whole extra life stuff on Saturday.

41:41.920 --> 41:45.760
So I was like, man, it'd be awesome to be able to just like play DDR all day and stream

41:45.760 --> 41:46.760
it.

41:46.760 --> 41:48.920
But that's a lot of DDR.

41:48.920 --> 41:52.680
Well, I wouldn't be doing like doubles non-stops constantly.

41:52.680 --> 41:54.960
I mean, that's the thing.

41:54.960 --> 41:55.960
Yeah.

41:55.960 --> 41:57.600
Well, um, let's figure that out.

41:57.600 --> 42:00.440
I mean, this week might be a little crazy cause of Halloween, but maybe in two weeks,

42:00.440 --> 42:05.320
why don't I come over and we'll do, um, like a strong, I'll come guest on your stream or

42:05.320 --> 42:06.320
something.

42:06.320 --> 42:07.320
Sure.

42:07.320 --> 42:08.320
And you get me a fourth mix plus.

42:08.320 --> 42:12.040
Oh, I have, I have the image in the seat, the drive, I just have to install it.

42:12.040 --> 42:13.040
All right.

42:13.040 --> 42:14.040
We'll make that happen.

42:14.040 --> 42:15.720
So anyway, exciting things happening with Twitch.

42:15.720 --> 42:19.040
Thanks to TwitchCon and hope everybody that went had a great time.

42:19.040 --> 42:21.880
I know Jason who does all the voiceovers here.

42:21.880 --> 42:26.560
If you noticed tonight, tonight's voiceover was very good, but he, you'll notice he kind

42:26.560 --> 42:27.920
of didn't address the news.

42:27.920 --> 42:32.020
He just said, hooray, they made it cause he did that in advance cause he's at TwitchCon.

42:32.020 --> 42:33.800
So he knew he'd be there this weekend.

42:33.800 --> 42:35.440
So he kind of gave us something we could use tonight.

42:35.440 --> 42:38.840
It's a little, little more generic and not targeted at the news this week since he wouldn't

42:38.840 --> 42:40.360
know what was going to come up in the news.

42:40.360 --> 42:42.960
So, uh, I know Jason's there and having a good time.

42:42.960 --> 42:45.520
So maybe we'll hear from him a little more about what it was like on the ground.

42:45.520 --> 42:51.040
And I know some streamers that I, I watch, um, and interact with went, so, um, hopefully

42:51.040 --> 42:52.400
we'll get to go next year.

42:52.400 --> 42:53.760
Uh, just wasn't in the cards this year.

42:53.760 --> 42:56.240
I really, please don't pick Halloween weekend next year.

42:56.240 --> 42:59.240
You guys, please don't pick Halloween weekend.

42:59.240 --> 43:02.600
And it's, you know what else is terrible about Halloween weekend?

43:02.600 --> 43:05.000
Next week is BlizzCon.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.880
And then the week after that, or two weeks after that is Final Fantasy Fan Fest, which

43:08.880 --> 43:11.880
I'm, which I realize not as many people are into, but I am.

43:11.880 --> 43:14.100
So it's like, Oh, back to back to back stuff.

43:14.100 --> 43:15.100
So crazy.

43:15.100 --> 43:16.100
Crazy.

43:16.100 --> 43:17.100
Anyway.

43:17.100 --> 43:18.100
Uh, let's get into our gaming weeks.

43:18.100 --> 43:21.480
Let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week, dark

43:21.480 --> 43:22.480
soccer.

43:22.480 --> 43:23.480
How was your gaming month?

43:23.480 --> 43:27.320
Um, I've been playing a lot of Pokemon go.

43:27.320 --> 43:30.280
Um, I'm still playing idle pouring.

43:30.280 --> 43:36.320
I've gotten back into playing a lot of bejeweled because this is going to sound stupid, but

43:36.320 --> 43:39.200
it really helps me relax right before bed.

43:39.200 --> 43:46.120
Um, and I'm also, um, I've got my wow subscription, but I haven't played in a while, which I really

43:46.120 --> 43:50.480
should now that people I know are playing and I kind of want to move my demon hunter

43:50.480 --> 43:52.240
over to proud more.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.440
I just need, you know, a guild to be in.

43:54.440 --> 43:55.440
I'm proud more.

43:55.440 --> 44:02.420
Um, other than the one I have, I need a, I need an Alliance Guild.

44:02.420 --> 44:05.000
Talk to Delvin cause he's the one that hooked me up.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
Yeah.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
We also, you know, there's also communities, there's not just guild, but communities.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
Yeah.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
But I want to be in a guild.

44:11.000 --> 44:15.820
But well I know, but also I was thinking anyway, just set up a community and somebody had the

44:15.820 --> 44:16.820
brilliant idea.

44:16.820 --> 44:17.820
I think that was me.

44:17.820 --> 44:18.820
Was it you?

44:18.820 --> 44:19.820
That conversation.

44:19.820 --> 44:20.820
Yes.

44:20.820 --> 44:21.820
You said call it death cake.

44:22.400 --> 44:24.500
After the, our old final fantasy 11 guild that we all used to play in.

44:24.500 --> 44:27.660
So other than that, I wanted to call it link shell.

44:27.660 --> 44:28.660
Yeah.

44:28.660 --> 44:29.660
I like that.

44:29.660 --> 44:30.660
That would have been funny.

44:30.660 --> 44:31.660
That's good.

44:31.660 --> 44:36.580
Um, but I've been playing a lot of, um, uh, theater of magic because I fucking love theater

44:36.580 --> 44:42.100
of magic and um, we may be selling a couple of our tables.

44:42.100 --> 44:44.380
Local people hit us up.

44:44.380 --> 44:51.480
Um, and then I'm consider, I'm trying to consider what I want to stream from PS one or Saturn

44:51.480 --> 44:55.460
era and I'm leaning towards symphony of the night for Saturn.

44:55.460 --> 44:58.280
For Maria, do the Maria stuff cause I've never really seen that.

44:58.280 --> 44:59.520
I'd be into that.

44:59.520 --> 45:00.520
Maria.

45:00.520 --> 45:05.060
Maria can steamroll through the game cause all she needs, well actually one of her spells

45:05.060 --> 45:09.160
is super hard to control and that's the Sadie one.

45:09.160 --> 45:10.160
Okay.

45:10.160 --> 45:14.080
So you know in Rondo how she has her little animal friend attacks Rob.

45:14.080 --> 45:15.080
Yeah.

45:15.080 --> 45:16.080
Okay.

45:16.080 --> 45:22.280
So well in, in symphony, um, she has like, they all are like magic attacks and she can

45:22.280 --> 45:27.800
summon like a big dragon that you can control over the screen.

45:27.800 --> 45:28.800
It is insane.

45:28.800 --> 45:29.800
Yeah.

45:29.800 --> 45:34.240
Or like, you know, a firebird instead of her little sparrows, it's, it's pretty intense.

45:34.240 --> 45:38.240
Except, you know, it's just not, not as pretty honestly enough as the PlayStation one, which

45:38.240 --> 45:41.960
is really stupid given that Saturn had a better 2d processor.

45:41.960 --> 45:44.480
Um, but I'm still trying to decide.

45:44.480 --> 45:47.760
I'm also kind of thinking of getting out, you know, a translation guide and played through

45:47.760 --> 45:48.760
blue seed RPG.

45:48.760 --> 45:49.760
I don't know.

45:49.760 --> 45:50.760
So.

45:50.760 --> 45:51.760
All right.

45:51.760 --> 45:52.760
We'll see.

45:52.760 --> 45:53.760
All right.

45:53.760 --> 45:54.760
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

45:54.760 --> 45:59.000
Um, my week was mainly just, uh, well a lot of dance has revolution.

45:59.000 --> 46:05.800
So I was streaming most of this week, um, after work doing my, like I ended up being

46:05.800 --> 46:09.000
in about like 45 minutes to 50 minutes a day.

46:09.000 --> 46:18.560
So I catch that twitch.tv slash logy O R and then, um, beyond that, uh, Pokemon go and

46:18.560 --> 46:21.040
then playing a bit of that.

46:21.040 --> 46:26.760
And then also, um, a little bit of redhead redemption too, which is an excellent game.

46:26.760 --> 46:30.560
Um, so I've been hopefully going to get into more of that.

46:30.560 --> 46:36.140
Um, it was funny that I actually realized that like when I was downloading that, making

46:36.140 --> 46:39.700
sure, well, of course I had enough hardware space cause I have a pro with a one terabyte

46:39.700 --> 46:42.100
on there and only had 500.

46:42.100 --> 46:43.100
I have a pro too.

46:43.100 --> 46:44.160
And it's already full.

46:44.160 --> 46:48.140
So yeah, well I haven't, I haven't been downloading a ton of stuff lately, but I noticed that

46:48.140 --> 46:51.980
a lot of my VR stuff on there, I was like, Oh crap, I should read, don't download this

46:51.980 --> 46:52.980
crap.

46:52.980 --> 46:53.980
So I did that.

46:53.980 --> 47:00.460
And then, um, I meant to play some PlayStation VR as well, but I didn't get around to that.

47:00.460 --> 47:01.460
Unfortunately.

47:01.460 --> 47:05.960
Uh, yeah, lots of, lots of stuff I need to get around to, but I just haven't bothered

47:05.960 --> 47:06.960
yet.

47:06.960 --> 47:09.960
And on the DER side, of course, it sounds like I'm going to be putting fourth mix plus

47:09.960 --> 47:10.960
on my machine now.

47:10.960 --> 47:16.760
Uh, which is fine cause I've been like kinda getting, it's a little stale with extreme

47:16.760 --> 47:17.760
all the time.

47:17.760 --> 47:19.800
Um, be nice to go back and play some of the older stuff.

47:19.800 --> 47:26.980
I do miss not having my 1.5 speed and I have to remember now with the vivid, um, or no

47:26.980 --> 47:29.000
vivid was, what was it?

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
The solo air.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.920
I don't even know what I had to, I had to came up after was third mix.

47:33.920 --> 47:34.920
Right.

47:34.920 --> 47:39.760
I remember that vivid was a third mix, but I'm trying to think of like what mods I used

47:39.760 --> 47:43.600
to put on there when I was playing, um, normally.

47:43.600 --> 47:48.160
And I remember, I remember at the pocket station do custom nonstop.

47:48.160 --> 47:53.520
So I'm actually, I don't have a memory card slot in my machine, uh, which is unfortunate.

47:53.520 --> 47:56.200
And I had the opportunity to purchase one for like 150 bucks.

47:56.200 --> 47:58.000
I passed up on that.

47:58.000 --> 48:02.540
Now the only cheapest one I could find out $350, which I'm not buying, especially since

48:02.540 --> 48:07.400
I'm planning on switching my machine over to a step mania machine at some point.

48:07.400 --> 48:12.420
So I've actually been starting the prep work for that and the software side, picking out

48:12.420 --> 48:15.040
what I want and theme wise and everything.

48:15.040 --> 48:18.620
So that'll be coming some point soon, hopefully.

48:18.620 --> 48:21.660
And then, um, yeah, more red dead.

48:21.660 --> 48:26.140
I want to stream actual red dead and stuff and find a place to do like, you know, console

48:26.140 --> 48:31.020
and PC streaming in my garage, but I don't have a lot of room in there and it's kind

48:31.020 --> 48:36.180
of full of garbage right now and I need to like, you could get rid of the garbage.

48:36.180 --> 48:40.780
You know, you think that would be easy, but a lot of it is like a lot of it is my stuff.

48:40.780 --> 48:46.020
You know, like our garages, like houses disaster, like all my rock band stuff just sitting on

48:46.020 --> 48:47.020
the side.

48:47.020 --> 48:48.020
Did you play rock band?

48:48.020 --> 48:49.020
Yeah.

48:49.020 --> 48:53.860
But, um, I, yeah, it's, I have my 3d printing stuff out of the way and probably have some

48:53.860 --> 48:54.860
room there.

48:54.860 --> 49:00.260
Plus, there's no heat in the winter, so that'll be not as great, but better than the summer.

49:00.500 --> 49:02.020
I'll take cold, liver, hot.

49:02.020 --> 49:03.020
Yeah.

49:03.020 --> 49:05.840
You know, as where, where layers, all right.

49:05.840 --> 49:10.340
My gaming week, honestly, um, because again, I haven't been buying a lot of new games lately,

49:10.340 --> 49:14.620
uh, just because, uh, I've been trying to watch the finances, uh, just because of some

49:14.620 --> 49:15.620
personal stuff.

49:15.620 --> 49:20.220
Um, but, uh, I would say I've been playing more world, world of Warcraft, uh, which I

49:20.220 --> 49:24.100
never thought I would like be playing it this much, but, uh, I've just kind of been into

49:24.100 --> 49:27.740
it and I finally kind of hit a point where I was kind of, I got my brew master monk up

49:27.740 --> 49:32.180
to about level 60 and then I was like, I want to, I need to get back to trying to do

49:32.180 --> 49:33.180
the end game stuff.

49:33.180 --> 49:35.740
So I finally used my boost on a warlock.

49:35.740 --> 49:40.300
And so I started playing warlock just the other night and, uh, I'm, I'm loving how fast

49:40.300 --> 49:41.300
things melt.

49:41.300 --> 49:46.180
Like I forgot how much easier it is to quest as DPS as it is a tank or a healer.

49:46.180 --> 49:49.740
Uh, so that's, that's been really great and I'm liking warlock so far.

49:49.740 --> 49:56.140
So, uh, I hit level 111 earlier this weekend, so I'm making my way up slowly to 120, which

49:56.140 --> 49:57.860
I'll hopefully hit, uh, before too long.

49:57.860 --> 49:59.180
So that would be very nice.

49:59.180 --> 50:02.260
Um, otherwise, uh, I'm also still playing Pokemon go.

50:02.260 --> 50:05.420
I just got my little reward, the spirit tomb.

50:05.420 --> 50:08.660
I just got that from the, uh, the quest that they gave you for Halloween.

50:08.660 --> 50:13.340
So I just got that today cause I finally, you know how you have to do 108 Pokemon with

50:13.340 --> 50:14.340
berries, right?

50:14.340 --> 50:17.380
Well, if you weren't already aware, did you already finish it?

50:17.380 --> 50:18.380
Because guess what?

50:18.380 --> 50:19.860
After you do that, you get to do 108 more.

50:19.860 --> 50:20.860
I did that.

50:20.860 --> 50:21.860
Oh good.

50:21.860 --> 50:22.860
Oh, so you got your spirit too.

50:22.860 --> 50:24.380
My poofy weird looking thing.

50:24.380 --> 50:25.380
Nice.

50:25.620 --> 50:29.580
You know, what's funny is I have that, but I still am stuck on that quest that is visit

50:29.580 --> 50:32.540
eight pokey stops you haven't visited before.

50:32.540 --> 50:33.860
Did that finish it today?

50:33.860 --> 50:35.100
Oh nice.

50:35.100 --> 50:36.100
Because I guess what?

50:36.100 --> 50:41.140
I got seven yesterday at the wedding and I need one more.

50:41.140 --> 50:46.700
I got, I got one in, um, uh, on flooring.

50:46.700 --> 50:50.900
I got six in, um, old town, Elk Grove.

50:50.900 --> 50:51.900
Oh yeah.

50:51.900 --> 50:52.900
There's a bunch of stuff down there.

50:52.900 --> 50:53.900
I never went down there before.

50:54.420 --> 50:57.900
And then I got the last one downtown around the corner from the LGBT center.

50:57.900 --> 50:58.900
Yeah.

50:58.900 --> 50:59.900
There's a button.

50:59.900 --> 51:00.900
I mean, obviously there's a bunch of stuff downtown.

51:00.900 --> 51:02.260
I can find one easy.

51:02.260 --> 51:05.980
It's just a matter of like being, you know, honestly, I don't think I've been over to

51:05.980 --> 51:08.860
like the park in Rancho, the big park in Rancho Cordova.

51:08.860 --> 51:11.680
I don't think I've spun the stops over there since the game started tracking it.

51:11.680 --> 51:12.680
So you know what?

51:12.680 --> 51:13.680
I can probably just go over there.

51:13.680 --> 51:14.680
It's not a big deal.

51:14.680 --> 51:19.120
It's just taking the effort when, what do you have to, I'm sorry, you have to spend

51:19.120 --> 51:20.120
new stops.

51:20.120 --> 51:23.500
You have to do, well, the weird thing is you get the spirit tomb from when you catch the

51:23.500 --> 51:27.780
108 Pokemon, but part of the quest chain is still, you have another quest where you

51:27.780 --> 51:30.460
have to spin eight pokestops you haven't spun before.

51:30.460 --> 51:36.980
Oh, see that would have been nice when I just went to Santa Clara where it was all new stuff

51:36.980 --> 51:37.980
anyway.

51:37.980 --> 51:39.580
I mean, there's still places I haven't been.

51:39.580 --> 51:40.580
Yeah.

51:40.580 --> 51:44.660
Well, and I'm, I'm going to Vegas in a couple of weeks and I'll get a billion pokestops

51:44.660 --> 51:48.260
I haven't got before there, but that, but then that quest will be kind of gone.

51:48.260 --> 51:49.580
I'm sure I'll get one more stop.

51:49.580 --> 51:51.300
I haven't been to yet at some point.

51:51.300 --> 51:52.780
I'm sure that's inevitable.

51:53.060 --> 51:59.260
I still need the trade of Pokemon for one of the ones I have now because I'm on the

51:59.260 --> 52:00.260
six or whatever.

52:00.260 --> 52:02.540
I can trade you a garbage Pokemon if that's all you need.

52:02.540 --> 52:05.940
Well, I think I need the trade like, yeah, yeah, we can, yeah, whatever.

52:05.940 --> 52:08.540
Just trade, catch something on the house and trade it to me.

52:08.540 --> 52:09.540
It's easy.

52:09.540 --> 52:10.540
Oh, I've got plenty of stuff.

52:10.540 --> 52:11.540
There you go.

52:11.540 --> 52:12.540
There you go.

52:12.540 --> 52:13.540
I had a dust skull that, well, I think I threw it away.

52:13.540 --> 52:17.700
I had a shiny dust skull, but I gave you unknown from dragon con, right?

52:17.700 --> 52:18.700
No.

52:18.700 --> 52:19.700
Okay, done.

52:19.700 --> 52:20.700
I'll give you an unknown from dragon con.

52:20.700 --> 52:21.700
All right.

52:21.700 --> 52:22.700
Woo.

52:23.620 --> 52:24.620
I have so many of those.

52:24.620 --> 52:25.620
I have so many of them in my inventory.

52:25.620 --> 52:26.620
All right.

52:26.620 --> 52:27.620
Anyway.

52:27.620 --> 52:28.620
It's like another.

52:28.620 --> 52:29.620
Well, yeah, I was like, I gave you one.

52:29.620 --> 52:30.620
You gave me the D.

52:30.620 --> 52:31.620
Okay.

52:31.620 --> 52:32.620
Yes, right.

52:32.620 --> 52:34.180
I gave you the D. It's the only time in my life I've ever given Jamie the D.

52:34.180 --> 52:40.500
It's the only time in my life I've ever wanted the D. Also, it was kind of cute.

52:40.500 --> 52:42.500
Oh, thank you.

52:42.500 --> 52:45.420
She thought his D was cute.

52:45.420 --> 52:48.580
We are talking about unknowns that were caught at dragon con.

52:48.580 --> 52:50.020
Thank you very much.

52:50.020 --> 52:52.300
Anyway, uh, I guess that's it for my gaming week.

52:52.300 --> 52:54.300
Let's get into some gaming news.

52:54.300 --> 52:57.180
Some announcements real quick, actually, before we do news.

52:57.180 --> 53:01.380
We will not be here on November 18th.

53:01.380 --> 53:02.660
So that is a few weeks away.

53:02.660 --> 53:05.140
That is right before Thanksgiving.

53:05.140 --> 53:09.260
Uh, I will be at the final fantasy fan fest in Vegas, and that is the day we're coming

53:09.260 --> 53:10.260
back.

53:10.260 --> 53:11.860
So I won't get back in time for the show, sadly.

53:11.860 --> 53:14.060
So, uh, no show that week.

53:14.060 --> 53:15.060
Okay.

53:15.060 --> 53:17.180
Um, let's get into some gaming news, Loki.

53:17.180 --> 53:21.300
So this is kind of funny that I just read that they're doing this because I thought

53:21.300 --> 53:23.340
it already was on PC.

53:23.340 --> 53:28.820
In fact, I almost bought the game pass, um, when I got Forza.

53:28.820 --> 53:32.520
Um, but apparently this is a new thing.

53:32.520 --> 53:38.040
So Microsoft is considering, or they're, they're intending on expanding the Xbox game pass

53:38.040 --> 53:40.460
program to PC as well.

53:40.460 --> 53:47.260
Apparently they said that with the increased growth of gaming, um, rising or the revenue

53:47.260 --> 53:53.220
rising 44% that they are, um, and their service earnings increased by 36%.

53:53.220 --> 53:58.820
This is coming out of their, uh, financial year 2019 quarter one earnings report, um,

53:58.820 --> 54:05.500
that they're going to, um, this, I guess this rise in, um, earnings led them to discuss,

54:05.500 --> 54:09.560
Hey, maybe we should ask, should we expand this, you know, cross-platform like we are

54:09.560 --> 54:11.300
doing with their other games?

54:11.300 --> 54:16.220
Um, and so with that, you know, they said that it would fall under the titles.

54:16.220 --> 54:18.680
That would be the Xbox play anywhere label.

54:18.680 --> 54:22.620
And so with that, you would get, you know, like fours of the horizon, three, four gears

54:22.620 --> 54:29.660
of war for, um, so that's going to be included with the $10 monthly subscription.

54:29.660 --> 54:35.740
So yeah, I'm surprised, like, I swear, I thought that was already a thing that they had game

54:35.740 --> 54:37.860
pass that it would apply.

54:37.860 --> 54:41.600
Basically there would be any of the game anywhere titles because you're getting access to this

54:41.600 --> 54:42.820
library on the Xbox.

54:42.820 --> 54:46.540
And so just because you have it on PC, you can get access to those.

54:46.540 --> 54:51.340
Um, I'm not sure windows 10 was set up necessarily to support that, but I imagine the recent

54:51.340 --> 54:55.020
updates they've been doing, but I can purchase it through the windows 10 store though.

54:55.020 --> 54:56.020
Right.

54:56.020 --> 54:58.740
That's where it like, cause I even when I was going with game pass, we're using game

54:58.740 --> 54:59.740
pass.

54:59.740 --> 55:03.140
No, I wasn't like at the point I was like, I was planning on purchasing Forza and it's

55:03.140 --> 55:07.400
like, do you want to purchase Forza or you can get it free with game pass and like this

55:07.400 --> 55:09.060
is on the windows 10 store.

55:09.060 --> 55:10.060
Oh, interesting.

55:10.060 --> 55:12.020
So that's why I thought this was already a thing.

55:12.020 --> 55:14.180
I was like, Oh, well they already have it.

55:14.180 --> 55:19.140
It's just, it's not that great on PC because it's only the play anywhere titles.

55:19.140 --> 55:21.860
Like I can't go play red dead redemption all of a sudden on PC.

55:21.860 --> 55:24.820
Well, I imagine it will be expanding significantly too.

55:24.820 --> 55:27.660
I think Microsoft's really kind of shifted focus a little bit down.

55:27.660 --> 55:33.620
I mean that's, that's not bad, but, um, yeah, I guess we'll have to wait and see when that

55:33.620 --> 55:34.900
that comes out.

55:34.900 --> 55:38.340
Uh, yeah, the more and more like game pass keeps expanding and stuff.

55:38.340 --> 55:40.260
I gotta say I'm really tempted with it.

55:40.260 --> 55:44.420
I really, really, as if I don't have enough of a backlog, like, but game pass got a lot

55:44.420 --> 55:45.420
of good stuff.

55:45.420 --> 55:46.820
Um, so yeah, that's the thing.

55:46.820 --> 55:50.500
Like if they have a lot of like first party tiles, it'd be nice to go back and play some

55:50.500 --> 55:51.500
of the stuff I haven't played.

55:51.500 --> 55:56.900
But honestly, on PC it's mainly like Forza, it's like Forza, Forza, Forza, Forza and

55:56.900 --> 55:57.900
Gears of War.

55:57.900 --> 56:01.700
And I guess, you know, when the Halo stuff comes out, you know, that might be a little

56:01.700 --> 56:02.700
worth it too.

56:02.700 --> 56:03.700
But yeah.

56:03.700 --> 56:04.700
All right.

56:04.700 --> 56:09.100
Well, uh, moving on to another story about Pokemon go clones.

56:09.100 --> 56:11.780
I don't know if you've tried some of the various Pokemon go clones out there.

56:11.780 --> 56:12.780
I have not.

56:12.780 --> 56:15.540
My sister plays the Jurassic Park one all the time.

56:15.540 --> 56:17.500
I was going to say some of them are pretty good.

56:17.500 --> 56:23.280
I hear the Jurassic Park one's pretty well received the, uh, walking, walking dead, which

56:23.280 --> 56:27.980
I haven't played yet, but I hear there's people into that one too, uh, that that one is pretty

56:27.980 --> 56:29.020
fun as well.

56:29.020 --> 56:30.820
And then there's some pretty crappy ones too.

56:30.820 --> 56:35.500
Like Garfield go is, is like, LOL stupid, really dog shit.

56:35.500 --> 56:36.500
Yeah.

56:36.500 --> 56:40.620
Well, I dare you to talk bad about this Pokemon go clone because you might go to hell for

56:40.620 --> 56:42.300
making fun of this one.

56:42.300 --> 56:45.000
It is JC go.

56:45.000 --> 56:48.220
It was designed by a Catholic evangelical group.

56:48.220 --> 56:53.040
They don't say Pope Francis as apparently blessed JC go.

56:53.040 --> 56:55.780
I'll let you guess what JC stands for.

56:55.780 --> 57:01.360
Uh, apparently, uh, this was a game that was made in preparation for world youth day 2019.

57:01.360 --> 57:06.680
That is a Catholic youth event that will be happening in Panama up in January.

57:06.680 --> 57:12.020
Um, obviously you would not be throwing little balls at saints and Catholics and stuff to

57:12.020 --> 57:15.640
capture them, uh, to enslave them in the ball to do your bidding.

57:15.640 --> 57:16.640
So it's a little bit different.

57:16.640 --> 57:21.680
So what happens is that they join your evangelization team.

57:21.680 --> 57:25.760
If you can answer questions about the Bible, that's right.

57:25.760 --> 57:27.880
It's a Bible quiz game.

57:27.880 --> 57:32.080
So talk about edutainment games.

57:32.080 --> 57:34.120
I remember the years.

57:34.120 --> 57:37.640
People don't know this, but I went to church for several years and I used to be pretty

57:37.640 --> 57:38.640
good at them.

57:38.640 --> 57:39.640
Bible quizzes.

57:39.640 --> 57:40.640
I used to be able to recite the books.

57:40.640 --> 57:41.640
You know what?

57:41.640 --> 57:42.640
What?

57:42.640 --> 57:43.640
I did Bible drill.

57:43.640 --> 57:48.960
Did you, what's Bible drill where like you have to memorize whole passages and Oh wow.

57:48.960 --> 57:53.680
Find anything in the Bible and you know, be able to do, you know, they give you one book

57:53.680 --> 57:58.320
you have to see what's before and what's after and it was stupid.

57:58.320 --> 58:02.600
I gotta be honest, like, but I won like third place in one.

58:02.600 --> 58:07.000
Like anytime I hear about these, like, you know, and maybe just because I'm not religious,

58:07.000 --> 58:09.280
but like it just seems so forced.

58:09.280 --> 58:12.320
You mean, and it's always like a knockoff of something.

58:12.320 --> 58:17.640
It's like, I don't have a problem with you creating like edutainment.

58:17.640 --> 58:20.120
That's you know, original.

58:20.120 --> 58:23.240
That's you know, religious based, but like stop knocking shit off.

58:23.240 --> 58:27.520
Like I remember when I was dating someone that was going to tell that to the Pope.

58:27.520 --> 58:28.520
Stop knocking shit off.

58:28.520 --> 58:29.520
Yes.

58:29.520 --> 58:31.760
I am going to tell them to tell them, it's like, dude, fucking come up with your own

58:31.760 --> 58:32.760
original shit.

58:32.760 --> 58:33.760
You know what?

58:33.760 --> 58:34.760
Seriously.

58:34.760 --> 58:40.200
Um, no, I, I used to like date someone that was like really, really just stop touching

58:40.200 --> 58:41.200
little boys.

58:41.200 --> 58:46.160
And, and I remember going to her church group and they would like, they would quote unquote

58:46.160 --> 58:47.160
jam and shit.

58:47.160 --> 58:50.840
And they would just like come up with like these religious lyrics to fucking just like

58:50.840 --> 58:52.640
normal songs.

58:52.640 --> 58:54.680
Like, you know, like they were being alternate.

58:54.680 --> 58:55.680
Yeah.

58:55.680 --> 58:59.720
Basically like the, you know, they were doing alternative lyrics to, you know, um, my name

58:59.720 --> 59:04.920
is, you know, like, you know, they were, you know, my name is Jesus.

59:04.920 --> 59:05.920
Yeah, I know.

59:05.920 --> 59:06.920
I don't.

59:06.920 --> 59:07.920
Yeah.

59:07.920 --> 59:10.240
It's just like, I'm like, it's so cringy.

59:10.240 --> 59:11.240
It's just cringy.

59:11.240 --> 59:12.240
Awful.

59:12.240 --> 59:15.840
It makes me think of that comment that was said earlier about the edutainment games that

59:15.840 --> 59:17.720
there's a lot of kids that kind of see right through it.

59:17.720 --> 59:18.720
You know?

59:19.040 --> 59:22.660
Just don't like, I get it.

59:22.660 --> 59:24.560
It's popular, but you know what?

59:24.560 --> 59:28.080
Come up with something original and not just like fucking knock it off.

59:28.080 --> 59:32.520
Like come up with something that is unique.

59:32.520 --> 59:36.700
So you, what you would like, what, what if, what if they were to rip off like street fighter?

59:36.700 --> 59:42.320
What if there was like, you know, seen that though, I really, they had a Jesus game that

59:42.320 --> 59:48.160
is street fighter like types of, it's all these different religious deities.

59:48.160 --> 59:49.480
The Pope didn't like that one.

59:49.480 --> 59:54.120
And Santa Claus is in there too, because of course, but it is all these religious deities

59:54.120 --> 59:55.120
fighting each other.

59:55.120 --> 59:58.960
So they do have that already, but I mean, that's not supposed to be taken seriously

59:58.960 --> 59:59.960
at all.

59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.520
It's just, it's silly, but.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.640
And I don't think the Pope is a fan of that one.

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:11.280
I just, I'm sorry, just, it seems very, out of all the religions that I've had contact

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:16.000
with in, in my lifetime, I feel that like Christianity, and maybe it's not Christianity,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.240
I'm just bundling all of like those religions as Christianity.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.600
So I'm not going to like Lutheran.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:25.920
I fucking don't know Catholic, it's all fucking Christianity to me.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:26.920
Dominations thereof.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:27.920
Yes, whatever.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.960
I am ignorant.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.960
That is it.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.960
I am ignorant.

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.280
Can someone just clip that?

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.280
I am ignorant.

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.280
Can someone just clip that?

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.280
I am ignorant to your religions.

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.080
Can I play that on a future show?

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:43.560
Out of all of the religions that I have had exposure to, Christianity is the only one

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:47.280
that's trying to like actively recruit you into, it's like trying to fucking save you

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:50.380
and it's irritating as shit to me.

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:53.400
Like get it, you're happy with your religion, cool.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.400
It's funny.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.400
You know, it's funny.

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.680
And I don't want to get into the religion debate too far, we've already gone far enough.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.680
Not all religions do that.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:03.840
I know, I know of at least one that you have to ask several times to be a part of it.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:08.040
So like, I'm, I'm cool with, if you're happy with it, cool.

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.240
That that's your cup of tea, not my cup of tea.

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:15.640
I'm not hating you for, but dude, it's just, it seems so forced and this is just seems

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:16.640
kind of forced as well.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.960
It's like, come up with something different.

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:23.840
If you can make a fun game and also teach religion at the same time, more power to you.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:24.840
Same thing.

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:28.400
Like if you can make a game that's fun, that teaches you about fucking Oregon Trail, like

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:34.560
if that, that game wasn't out, we probably know shit about, you know, there was, okay.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:38.800
You know, I will say there was a game I used to play at the mine shaft, the arcade years

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:39.800
ago.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:43.760
And they had, because you know, that place was like secretly like a Mormon stronghold,

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.280
you know, the, the mine shaft.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:48.720
So they actually had upstairs, they had a couple of games and one of them was Noah's

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:53.960
Ark and in this Noah's Ark game, you were trying to pair up animals and take them on

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:54.960
the Ark.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.880
And I actually played this game cause I thought it was fun.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:57.880
It was a fun game.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:58.880
Exactly.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.120
That's how you get people interested in stuff.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.440
Not just like, whatever, you know what?

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.440
It's fine.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.440
It's not for me.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.520
I, why am I complaining about a game that's not for me?

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.520
As you always do.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.040
It's like me complaining about sports games.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:15.200
I mean, anybody that's getting a little nerve to buy some of your religious discussion,

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:18.760
you would, you would treat any game like this really.

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.000
I don't get it.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
It's fine.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.280
I just, and this is any game that's like trying this shit.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.280
That's any game.

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:28.240
Like even like the Jurassic parks, I was like, really, really lost world, really, really

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.240
Ghostbusters.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:32.740
You fucking need to make a goddamn, you know, Pokemon go clone.

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:37.900
Just fucking come up with some of the original, Ingress is different than Pokemon go.

01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:41.300
They're both AR games, but they're played completely fucking different.

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:46.460
But everybody, because Pokemon goes popular, everything's gotta be catching some bullshit

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:49.380
and like training it and trading and bull.

01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:53.720
It's just fucking Pokemon go make a different AR game.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:57.300
And that's why I'm kind of excited for Harry Potter, because since Niantic's involved there

01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:03.160
too, it's going to likely be a different game than Ingress prime, which we have to kind

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:05.900
of say Ingress prime now, because that's starting to roll out.

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:10.940
A lot of my friends are playing Ingress prime now, uh, that's because that's the scanner

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:12.780
that's going to replace Ingress in November.

01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:17.260
But anyway, uh, Ingress prime and, um, uh, Pokemon go, Harry Potter is sure to be different.

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.540
I'm really excited about it.

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:20.740
So yeah, that'll be neat.

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:26.740
That'll try because I, you know, I like their track record, buggish fucking shit.

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:27.740
Oh yeah.

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:28.740
Speaking of Niantic.

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:29.740
Oh boy.

01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:34.980
You know, so I saw that they have that update now where it's going to be tracking your,

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:38.940
you know, basically doing what it's supposed to be doing, which is coming up later in the

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:39.940
show.

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:40.940
So watch what you say.

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:46.020
But like to that I had to laugh because like I use, you know, a gotcha or whatever and

01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:50.260
I keep the app, I just keep my phone like asleep as I'm doing that.

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:53.660
And that app crashes so fucking often in my pocket.

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:55.420
It's just like, really?

01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:58.360
You're going to, you're going to be tracking this in the background because fucking your

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.940
app cannot stay open for like more than five minutes anyways.

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:04.220
Well, I think there's a way it may still work.

01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:07.300
We'll talk a little more about that later in the show when we get to that.

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:08.300
So all right.

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:11.020
But for now, let's go to another story from Dark Sakura.

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:12.540
Yeah.

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:22.320
So at any rate, there is a few actually interesting things going on in the print world.

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:26.060
First of all, we all know what Raspberry Pi is, right?

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:27.060
Delicious.

01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:28.060
Yes.

01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:31.980
A delicious tiny little thing for your TV that's basically a computer.

01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:32.980
Yeah.

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:36.740
That is a tiny computer to make it easier to get into computing.

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:43.100
Well, they are doing a magazine dedicated to video game development and video gaming

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:45.260
called Wireframe.

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:50.700
And even better, they're giving away 10,000 free copies of the first edition if you register

01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:52.540
on their website.

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:59.580
I put in for it, by the way, it's two pound shipping to the U.S. from the U.K.

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:06.940
But it's also going to be, you know, money that's used to buy the print version will

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:12.780
go back in to keep the Raspberry Pi foundation going so that they can keep making low cost

01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:14.760
computers for people.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:19.740
They also own other publications, including the Mag Pi and Hack Space magazine, which

01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:23.940
is under Raspberry Pi Press.

01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:26.740
But Wireframe itself is going to be more indie focused.

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:28.340
So that will be really good.

01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:34.640
They actually have things like mods, early access games, development tools, all kinds

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:35.640
of neat stuff.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:41.900
So I did actually decide it would be worth it to get in a little bit on this and ordered

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:46.860
the first issue, which will go on sale officially on November 8th, 2018.

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:52.300
And we'll have an interview with the creative director for Assassin's Creed 3 and Far Cry

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:53.820
4, Alex Hutchinson.

01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:55.500
So we'll see.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:56.500
Nice.

01:05:56.500 --> 01:06:02.300
I need to get me one of these things and, you know, for science, for science, absolutely.

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:05.380
I bet a Raspberry Pi would probably be more powerful than the computer we're using now

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:06.380
to do O.L.R.

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:07.380
You want to know what?

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.540
Can a Raspberry Pi run Windows 10?

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:12.020
That's probably true.

01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:13.760
You and I need to talk.

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:14.760
Do we?

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.860
But we always talk.

01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:20.220
We need to repeat a conversation that we've had.

01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:21.220
All right.

01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:22.220
Let's move on.

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:24.420
A few more stories where we get to the classic game of the week.

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:25.420
Loki.

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:32.560
Apparently, with the release of Soul Calibur 6, there's been, you know, some shenanigans

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:35.300
being done with the create a character mode.

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:41.180
So apparently, I really I guess you can take these creative characters, the custom characters

01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:45.020
online and actually play ranked matches with them, which is a little weird.

01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:47.220
Yeah, I think I think that is the thing you can do.

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:49.340
And so you imagine it.

01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:54.140
Someone's done it, you know, took like five seconds for someone to do Bowsette in Soul

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:55.140
Calibur 6.

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:59.340
So now there's these troll characters that appear online because what they're doing is

01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:03.260
they're using the create a character mode on PC and, of course, using a cheat engine

01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:09.980
or something like that to be able to go beyond the bounds of what is available on those sliders,

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:13.180
which I'm glad that they have no anti-sanity check.

01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:16.460
Thanks a lot, Namco Bandai.

01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:22.520
But so now you have things like this dude that's in a giant cube or basically the cube

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:23.520
that they're fighting.

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:25.400
You can't see the person in the cube.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:26.400
You see this giant cube.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:29.280
So it's hard to judge where the person is to play that.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:32.240
So they've done that.

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:37.960
And also, I guess the guy that was behind it, Abok, he was also showing off how you

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:38.960
can do this yourself.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.800
So he made a giant apple as well.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:45.360
And then there's a nice little picture that I saw with someone that made a giant dick

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:49.080
because the TTP in anything is immediately.

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:50.080
Yes.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.840
And Red Dead Redemption also saw a picture because of the wonderful snow physics that

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:55.960
they have that you can walk and you can see the trail.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.880
Someone also walked in the shape of a penis.

01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:58.880
You don't say.

01:07:58.880 --> 01:07:59.880
Yes.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:00.880
You don't say.

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:04.760
Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Bob Coffey says lizard dongs are a big problem

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:05.920
in Soul Calibur 6.

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:08.040
I don't even know if that's a joke or a true statement.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:11.360
It's got to be a true statement.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:16.840
But yeah, so it's kind of weird, though, that I'm assuming this is going to get patched

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:17.840
out.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.240
They've got to put some sort of sanity checks in there.

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:23.000
You know, hey, you know, is this between this and this value?

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.880
If not, you know, flag this or whatever.

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:27.720
I'm surprised that that's not a thing.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:33.760
But that's as I like to call it at work, MVP, Minimal Viable Product.

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:36.600
All right.

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:40.340
Let's talk about something else that is probably like the minimum of what they can offer because

01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:43.640
there's going to be a lot of problems with this, I think, and that is the PlayStation

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.800
name change feature.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:49.320
As we have already discussed, the name change feature probably isn't going to work with

01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:52.940
a lot of old PlayStation games because it's only going to be guaranteed to work with games

01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:55.200
after a certain date or beyond.

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:59.200
And even then, apparently, some of the beta testers are learning that name changes may

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:04.440
actually make you lose access to content like paid DLC for your games.

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:07.960
Things like leaderboard data, progress towards trophies.

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:08.960
Not all the time.

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.760
I want to stress, not all the time.

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:14.040
But in some cases, this is getting messed up.

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:18.520
Why are we implementing a feature that breaks things like I don't want it?

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:19.520
It is a beta.

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:20.520
Let's be fair.

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:21.520
Betas.

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:26.480
When we test these things that come to light in the hopes that Sony will fix them.

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:28.680
But it's not looking good so far.

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:33.300
Like honestly, y'all just probably want to keep the names you've got right now.

01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:37.200
Maybe wait for PlayStation five before you start making some big change.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.560
I got to say, honestly, like fuck that.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.680
I mean, like, I'll just wait for the next fucking Microsoft console to be honest.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.880
This is ridiculous.

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:49.600
Bobby Blackwolf in chat suggests, even if it's broken, just give me the option.

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:52.920
Some people want to change their name that badly.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.800
Even if it's broken, give me the option.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:57.760
I'm not changing my name, so I'm good.

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.760
Yeah, I know.

01:09:58.760 --> 01:09:59.760
I'm in a weird place.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.600
It's like, I'm not really interested in changing my name.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:04.480
Like I'm not like Rob Roberts on PlayStation, but that's what I'm like.

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:05.480
I'm okay with that.

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:06.480
It's fine.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:12.880
Plus PlayStation allows you to link to Facebook and like, you know, if we're going to be PlayStation

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:15.360
friends, we're probably Facebook friends.

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.080
And that's a really good way to find people.

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:23.680
So like I kind of the names don't really matter when you have that sort of integration, but

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:27.680
that's just at least my, I don't know, my thing.

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:28.920
All right.

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:29.920
Interesting.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:34.840
We have a user in our chat at live.vognetwork.com named Protect the Second who says, it's so

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:39.640
funny because I made my PlayStation network the same I have on this IRC and they made

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:40.640
me change it.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.020
It changed no problem.

01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:44.940
So weird that this has taken so long to make a feature.

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:47.180
So if they don't like your name, you can change it easily.

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:52.220
Well, that is an interesting counterpoint is that if they force you to do a name change

01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:58.200
because you know, you have something in your name that either you, you get a name clash

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:01.060
with a famous person that wants like, you can't name yourself Lady Gaga.

01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:05.460
So if Lady Gaga wants that name, she gets it, uh, whether you like it or not, uh, or

01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:09.020
something that is quote unquote offensive.

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:14.500
I'm not, oh, cause her name is really Stephanie.

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:15.500
I see what she did there.

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:20.660
I go, she's so I'd be pissed if that was the case, honestly, like, you know, Oh, well,

01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:21.660
I'm sorry.

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:22.660
I want this thing.

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:24.940
Well, no, no, but it's weird that they could force you to change it.

01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:25.940
It doesn't have any problems.

01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:31.660
If I was Lady Gaga, like back when, you know, the PS3 came out or whatever like that.

01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:35.060
And then for whatever reason, she decided to get in the game and wanted to be called

01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:36.060
Lady Gaga.

01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:37.060
They would just, okay.

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:39.940
I know this is a hypothetical situation, but like, I'd be fucking pissed.

01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:41.780
Let's say you have like an offensive name.

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:46.140
Like let's say you took your hatred of JC go too far and you made a handle on PlayStation

01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:47.140
network.

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:48.140
JC go to hell.

01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:49.140
Yeah.

01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:50.140
Okay.

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:51.140
You made it.

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:52.280
You made JC go to hell and somebody's going to say, you know what?

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:57.400
Go to hell is not a nice thing to say on PlayStation network when kids could be on it playing Minecraft.

01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:01.840
So they're going to force you to change your name away from JC go to hell so they can force

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:04.720
you to change your name and it works fine apparently.

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:07.320
So why doesn't it work in this case?

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.320
It's weird.

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.320
It's very strange.

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:14.820
Anyway, uh, Bobby Black Wolf suggests they probably have a complicated manual system

01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:18.920
that they can do behind the scenes to allow the forced name change, which is not something

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:22.920
they can replicate in an automatic way that is consumer facing.

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:26.320
It all goes back to the whole, they made a bad design.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:29.600
So all right.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:34.280
D'artistsuya in chat says along those lines to what Rob was saying over on Nintendo, I

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:37.720
found a Miss Vangie on Splatoon 2.

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:38.720
She even added me.

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:43.920
Though I don't know if it's just a fan or what, uh, video games, drag queen, likely

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:44.920
OLR listener.

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:45.920
Yes.

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:48.920
I don't know.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:50.880
Dark Sakura is your, is your Nintendo name?

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:51.880
Miss Vangie?

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:52.880
No.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:55.480
I don't think it's just Dark Sakura.

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.880
All right.

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.720
Anyway, uh, let's move on.

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:01.200
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us next in the news?

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:02.960
The library of Congress.

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:05.360
Oh, the library is open.

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:06.360
Yeah.

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.440
I'll read something about the government.

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.440
No.

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:15.040
Um, anyway, uh, the library of Congress in the US Copyright Office revised its list of

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:20.240
specific exceptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the DMCA.

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:28.560
Um, it now has expanded, um, the ability to revive and protect older games as well as

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:36.560
DIY repairs to systems to break DRM to fix the hardware.

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:42.160
Basically, um, it's, it's all in the name of preserving old games.

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:48.120
In fact, um, they gave libraries and archives as well as museums their right to circumvent

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:52.720
DRM so that video games can be preserved in playable condition.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:57.200
And so this year's list actually reaffirmed and expanded that a little bit.

01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:03.080
So, um, an additional section there actually calls out instances where online authentication

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.440
is required in order to play games.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:10.200
Um, once a copyright holder shuts down authentication services, consumers now have the right to

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:13.320
break DRM in order to play games.

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:18.640
So yes, you can copy that floppy in order to play a game that can no longer validate

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.440
you online.

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:23.760
And I know this was a big, um, kind of back and forth in the gaming industry.

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.160
Uh, just not that long ago.

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.320
So we were talking about, you know, servers coming down and so forth.

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:28.720
So this is a pretty big deal.

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:33.000
Well, it goes into effect as of today.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000
So huzzah, I'm sure there are going to be some court challenges coming up.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.720
I'd really like to see how it pans out, but for right now, do the thing.

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:47.160
You can copy that floppy all you want in this context and this context only.

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:49.280
Break that DRM for preservation.

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:50.280
Not the new stuff.

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:51.280
So, all right.

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:54.440
Only when the servers get taken offline, which, um,

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:55.440
Final Fantasy 11.

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.440
Woo!

01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:57.440
Yeah.

01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:58.440
Right.

01:14:58.440 --> 01:14:59.440
And some other games too, right?

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:00.440
Logie?

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:01.440
Yes.

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.440
Other games like Warhawk on PS3.

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:07.560
Apparently there's a couple of people that are up in arms about the fact that it was

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:12.200
announced that they would be shutting down their servers on October 25th as opposed to

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:16.680
the 90 day window that they're supposed to give us according to the back of the box.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:22.680
Um, previous games that they did shut down like recently at, well, not so recent, SOCOM,

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:27.600
they shut down their servers August 31st, 2012, and they did announce that 90 days

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.160
in advance, but Warhawk, not so much.

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:35.240
I got to wonder how many people are actually playing Warhawk, so, uh, but another one bites

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:39.800
the dust, but I'm guessing that there was really no one playing that game.

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:42.560
Maybe that's why I didn't do notice.

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:47.960
Yeah, I'm guessing a lot of these games probably aren't super trafficked anyway, but you never

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:48.960
know.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:49.960
Yeah.

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.600
I'm sure it made somebody angry enough to write an article about it.

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:58.000
Uh, Destiny 100 Matt, uh, eulogizing a bit, says Warhawk was a fun game at its time.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.880
Well, hey, you know, thanks to this Library of Congress decision, you can bring it back.

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:06.720
Well, I mean, this is, you know, it's funny though with the Warhawk thing is like, they

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:07.720
could bring it back.

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:11.280
They just put it as part of like a PlayStation Now thing and then you can play it online

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:12.280
still.

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:14.480
I guess they probably just don't make enough money to run those servers.

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.520
It's not beneficial for them.

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:17.520
All right.

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:21.840
Uh, let's see, let's talk about Dreamcast games coming to the Switch.

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:22.840
Yep, that's right.

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:26.520
You might get to relive your favorite Dreamcast classics all over again.

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:32.240
This coming from a recent, uh, talk with Famitsu where Naoki Horii from Sega talked about how

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:38.160
the Switch was getting very close to successfully running the Dreamcast titles, uh, via emulation,

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.160
which would not be surprising.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:40.160
They were doing it on PC.

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.880
They invented it on other consoles.

01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:43.360
So why not the Switch as well?

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:47.340
So they could theoretically remake or port certain Dreamcast games.

01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:48.340
So sure.

01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:49.340
Why not?

01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:50.640
Space Channel Five all over again.

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:51.700
Crazy Taxi.

01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:52.700
Why not?

01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:53.700
But you know what?

01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:56.640
Where's the, I mean, I know it's not a Sega game, but like when I think of Dreamcast,

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:57.640
I think of Power Stone.

01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:02.320
I was just going to say like, it's not a Dreamcast game, but like Power Stone, please.

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:05.480
The best we got was PSP I think had a Power Stone.

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:11.240
It was PSP or Vida got a Power Stone collection of one and two, I believe.

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:12.240
I think it was PS.

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:15.160
No, it must have been Vida.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:20.640
I don't think PSP would have had Power Stone, but it was one of the Sony portable systems

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.240
that got that.

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:26.200
Um, but yeah, I, I would love a new Power Stone game.

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:27.920
It would be awesome.

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.000
Or even some of those characters coming over to like a Street Fighter game or something

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000
like that.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Yeah.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
At least, uh, at least it would be nice if somebody would like take the concept, but

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.720
I guess, um, they are, uh, it was PSP.

01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:40.720
Okay.

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:44.080
I guess Capcom is talking about bringing some of their old stuff back, kind of.

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:46.160
They had a tweet about it this week.

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:52.040
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf suggests Seaman HD, a popular Dreamcast game that always comes up

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:53.040
on OLR.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:54.040
That is supposed to be coming.

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:55.040
There's supposed to be a new Seaman coming.

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:58.200
I thought there would, they're working on a new Seaman.

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:03.400
So whenever that happens, didn't they, was it like a Kickstarter or something?

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.920
I thought that they were doing that.

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:05.920
Yeah.

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:08.020
I thought I remember that being a thing that we talked about earlier too.

01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:14.180
So orange right suggests considering that Parappa port essentially ran on a PSP emulator

01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:16.580
and apparently Castlevania might be a similar situation.

01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:19.620
I can see Capcom releasing Power Stone on PlayStation four.

01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:21.500
You just, you just need to scream.

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:24.260
You need to passively, aggressively tweet Capcom enough.

01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:25.260
No, I'm just kidding.

01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:28.740
Be respectful, but you know, let them know, let them know the demand is out there.

01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:29.960
So all right.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:33.640
And yeah, dark to see you confirming what I saw on Twitter, uh, Capcom's confirmed that

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:37.380
they're putting Resident Evil zero, Resident Evil four on switch.

01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:41.300
So you get to buy Resident Evil four again, but I mean, it was a really good, like it's

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:42.940
probably like the best Resident Evil game.

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:43.940
So Power Stone instead.

01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:44.940
Yeah.

01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:45.940
I'd like to see some Power Stone.

01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:49.660
I'd even like take Tatsunoko versus Capcom, but I don't think that's going to happen.

01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:50.660
Oh man.

01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:53.180
I would love them to bring that out on, on the switch.

01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:55.660
Now I'd imagine the licensing issues are gonna make that a challenge.

01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:58.340
So I don't know about that, but you can still play that in some arcades.

01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:00.660
I know round one in a Concord has it.

01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:02.900
So I almost stopped at round one in San Jose.

01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:08.300
I was so tempted, but I was like, I can't stand being in this car any longer than half

01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:09.300
there.

01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:10.300
And the kids have whined.

01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:11.300
Yeah.

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:12.300
I play ticket games.

01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:13.300
Yeah.

01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:14.300
I'll play the crane.

01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:15.300
I'll play dancer.

01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:17.300
She doesn't want to play a game with the answer.

01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:18.300
No ticket games.

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:25.860
It was like, uh, all right, uh, let's take a trip down memory lane to the classic game

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:27.260
of the week.

01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:30.580
Not Power Stone tonight, but another goodie because every week dark soccer gets into the

01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:34.340
gaming vault and usually we have to rely on radio magic to make it happen.

01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:39.460
But she's here in person for this very special 750th episode of orange launch radio to pick

01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:44.660
a game that she thinks, Hey, brats, you should be respecting this game.

01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:47.420
And honestly though, this is a game everybody already respects.

01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:54.100
I think like, I don't know people that don't not like this game unless they just dislike

01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:55.100
this genre.

01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:57.900
If they dislike this genre, then they probably don't care for this game.

01:19:57.900 --> 01:19:59.740
But if you're into this genre, you like this game.

01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:01.140
Anyway, I'll stop yapping.

01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:05.840
What is the classic game of the week dark saga versus street fighter, which, no, I haven't

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:06.840
done it before.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:07.840
I checked the Wiki.

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:12.940
So X-Men versus street fighter, um, it is a fighting game.

01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:21.820
It is the big one that started the versus saga that came out in Japan in September 1996.

01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:28.860
And um, it had several different home releases, the best of course being on the sake of Saturn.

01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:35.500
Um, it basically had, it was actually, I kind of look at it as a direct result of X-Men

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.020
children of the Adam.

01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:41.540
So it had the characters from X-Men battling street fighter characters.

01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:48.860
Um, it was, uh, honestly a very unique game cause I mean you had, what else was the only

01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:51.860
thing out like it at the time was king of fighters.

01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:57.340
And, but this one was definitely like a combining of, of different genres.

01:20:57.340 --> 01:20:59.340
It was pretty cool.

01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:05.500
Um, it was pretty positively received and it also gave way to the sequel Marvel superheroes

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:08.460
versus street fighter that came out the next year.

01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:11.660
So with this one, it is a 2D fighting game.

01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:13.960
You have all kinds of different characters.

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:19.900
It is the first formal installment of the Marvel versus Capcom series.

01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:22.380
So this, this isn't started the whole thing.

01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:26.780
Um, you start off with, you know, each character has their own life gauge and you switch between

01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:31.220
each character so that you can have some people refill their life bar in the back end.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:38.060
Um, you know, you had assist moves and hyper combos and variable counters and fun stuff

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:39.620
like that.

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:45.900
Um, you also had, um, your arcade mode where you do a story against an AI and you have

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:46.900
your versus mode.

01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:53.460
Um, if you do the story mode, then after you beat apocalypse, you actually fight your partner.

01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:55.740
You're left with whoever you beat the boss with.

01:21:55.740 --> 01:22:00.140
Um, and then you get an ending for that one.

01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:07.740
So the characters that were in this one, um, were, uh, Cyclops, Gambit, Juggernaut, Magneto,

01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:10.780
Rogue, Sabretooth, Storm and Wolverine.

01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:18.100
And then for the, uh, street fighter characters, Akuma or Golki as he was in Japan, Kami, Charlie,

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:26.780
um, Chun-Li, Dalsim, Ken, Bison, oh well, or Balrog I guess as he was, uh, not Balrog.

01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:29.780
Who was it?

01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:30.780
Vega, that was it.

01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:31.780
Vega.

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:32.780
They were all so many bad people.

01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:43.020
Uh, Ryu and Zangief, so, um, the game was, uh, released on, uh, for CPS2 arcade board

01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:51.260
and, um, it had a direct port to Sega Saturn that was, uh, released with the 4MB RAM cart.

01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:55.060
This did not come out in the U.S. because they didn't know shit about marketing Saturn

01:22:55.060 --> 01:23:01.300
in the U.S., um, but they were selling it at EB in the U.S.

01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:05.420
Um, Sega had plans to release it in Europe, um, that had it bundled with the expansion

01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:09.620
cartridges, but they eventually put that to the side.

01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:17.300
I said, um, that it was going to be exclusive to the Saturn and then, um, because, uh, Capcom

01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:21.300
was accused of favoritism to the Saturn, but even though the Saturn versions of Street

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:28.700
Fighter Alpha 2 were better and the home version of, uh, Night Warriors was a Saturn exclusive

01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:33.460
as well, Capcom pulled back on that and said that they would do a PlayStation version,

01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:37.540
which was, of course, nowhere near arcade perfect.

01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:41.860
Um, it was pretty terrible, actually.

01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:47.100
It was missing animation, it had no versus mode, um, you know, because of the memory

01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:54.740
limitations of the, um, the PlayStation, of course, there was no real, like, supported

01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:57.460
RAM, uh, cart, you know.

01:23:57.460 --> 01:24:01.020
I was assuming that they would have something that would have fit into that I.O. port in

01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:06.100
the back, but that never happened and, of course, you know that, um, later models never

01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:09.140
had, they removed all those extra ports in the back.

01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:13.140
Which, by the way, I found the first gen PlayStation at a first gen the other day.

01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:17.140
I didn't get it because I already have, like, three of them.

01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:25.020
Um, but the game was positively received, um, it was really fun except, of course, the

01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:31.260
PlayStation 1 was pretty much, you know, kicked in the ass for being terrible, um, and then,

01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:35.260
of course, it led to the sequel, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, which then led

01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:43.260
to, you know, Marvel vs. Capcom series, Marvel vs. SNK, Capcom vs. SNK, Tatsu no Ko vs. Capcom.

01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:48.940
We have more and more of these versus series, uh, coming out that just took everything we

01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:51.460
loved and made it awesome.

01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:55.260
Except for what the fuck is up with putting that comedian in Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street

01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:57.260
Fighter, that's stupid.

01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:58.260
Norimaru.

01:24:58.260 --> 01:24:59.260
I'm done.

01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:05.260
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, a classic fighter for sure.

01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:08.260
X-Men vs. Street Fighter.

01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:12.260
Good pick for a landmark episode of Orange Lounge Radio, good, uh, fighting game selection.

01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:13.260
Yes.

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:17.260
Alright, we're gonna take a quick break, but when we come back, there is plenty more Orange

01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:20.260
Lounge Radio to come, including more rapid fire news.

01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:24.260
We're gonna get to, uh, your emails, or emails as the case may be, and we'll get to your

01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:27.260
calls, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:31.260
When we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:41.260
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight with episode number 750

01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:43.260
of our show already in progress.

01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:47.260
Um, I know you guys love all the Pokémon GO updates, but I do have to say, so during

01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:53.260
the break, uh, I traded that unknown to Loki, and, uh, I said, just give me anything that

01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:56.260
I won't be upset if it went lucky, and he gave me a Magikarp.

01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:57.260
Guess what happened?

01:25:57.260 --> 01:25:58.260
Lucky trade.

01:25:58.260 --> 01:25:59.260
Of course, yeah.

01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:03.260
So now I have a lucky Magikarp, which obviously will become a Gyarados when I have the candy,

01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:04.260
and, um...

01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:06.260
Apparently, Gastly's turned into Diddos now.

01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:07.260
Oh, do, oh, can they?

01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:08.260
Oh, is the one on my house a Ditto?

01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:09.260
Yeah, the one is a Ditto, yeah.

01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:10.260
Oh, funny.

01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:13.260
And then, uh, but you got a lucky unknown, which not a lot of people have, so there you

01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:14.260
go.

01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:15.260
Yep.

01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:16.260
That's fun.

01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:17.260
Alright.

01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:20.260
Anyway, uh, let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about, uh, some other quick

01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:24.260
things that have been happening this week while Mr. Smoosh is screaming in the other

01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:29.260
room, so I'm gonna see if some kibble will satiate his fat ass for a little while.

01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:30.260
Loki.

01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:31.260
Alright.

01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:32.260
Just bring him to me.

01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:34.260
I will comfort him.

01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:35.260
Alright.

01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:42.260
So, uh, Jade Raymond has left Electronic Arts, and she was, of course, the producer of the

01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:50.260
Assassin's Creed series before moving to EA's Motive Studio, uh, about three years ago,

01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:57.260
and, uh, she was originally gonna be overseeing a, I think it was that, uh, Star Wars, uh,

01:26:57.260 --> 01:27:02.260
the single-player game, the kind of, uh, action-adventure game, but apparently they canceled that, so

01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:10.260
now, um, Motive is working on a new IP in Star Wars, um, project, but she is no longer

01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:15.260
gonna be working on that, because she has left the studio onto bigger and better things

01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:20.260
than whatever EA can churn out for a Star Wars game.

01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:26.260
Um, and then, of course, for you, Soul Calibur 6 players, they'd be happy to know that Nier

01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:34.260
Automata's 2B is gonna be coming to Soul Calibur 6 as a, um, DLC character.

01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:36.260
So, that's pretty awesome.

01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:37.260
Alright.

01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:42.260
Uh, last week on the show, we spent some time talking about the Intellivision Amico, and

01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:46.260
we had mentioned that more information would be coming out on the Monday following our

01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:47.260
show, and that did happen.

01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:50.260
They did end up having a trailer, uh, that came out.

01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:54.260
Um, most of the trailer kind of recap things we already had known about, uh, although you

01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:58.260
did get to see some of the personalities that would be involved with the Intellivision.

01:27:58.260 --> 01:27:59.260
A lot of people.

01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:00.260
I didn't realize how many.

01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:03.260
Yeah, which the one that struck me as funny, which obviously, you know, going back way

01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:09.260
back throwback to our DDR days, but the guy that was, like, big with DDR's relations,

01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:13.260
I think it was, like, PR relations, and I don't remember what his official title was,

01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:16.260
but Jason Enos was kind of, out of Konami, he was, like, kind of like the face of DDR

01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:20.260
a little bit for a while, and he's going to be, it sounds like, what, like second in command

01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:22.260
on this Intellivision thing, isn't he?

01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:26.260
Yeah, and I remember, what was it, Dave Perry with, was it Shiny?

01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:32.260
He was in there as well, so, I mean, lots of people that are on board with this thing,

01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:33.260
so it has potential.

01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:35.260
I'm curious to see what happens with it.

01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:39.260
And Perrin Kaplan, who I think was involved with Nintendo for a short while, unfortunately,

01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:44.260
I think she was there during that whole Wii Vitality sensor debacle, but, not everything's

01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:46.260
a hit, it happens.

01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:51.260
So, anyway, Loki, would you mind grabbing this other thing I had, because unfortunately

01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:54.260
I'm not able to pull it up on this computer, it's having a problem.

01:28:54.260 --> 01:28:55.260
Oh, darn, that Windows XP.

01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:59.260
I know, right, but I know it has to do with Capcom's beat-em-up bundle, and it's getting

01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:00.260
a new patch that's coming out.

01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:06.260
Yeah, it's because their beat-em-up bundle was absolute dog shit on, I think it was PC,

01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:08.260
but apparently that's not the issue.

01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:12.260
It says they're going to be getting a patch that's coming in November, and it's going

01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:16.260
to be adding new screen filters, a new screen size, an option to turn off the ability for

01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:18.260
other players to join in-game sessions online.

01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:23.260
I guess that has nothing to do with just the absolute lag and bullshit that was in, I think,

01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:26.260
the PC version, or maybe in the Switch version.

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:30.260
I just remember watching a video of it where it was stuttering like fucking crazy.

01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:32.260
But that's cool that they're supporting their games.

01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:38.260
Hopefully whatever that issue was and whatever version it was that I saw a video of is fixed.

01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:42.260
Alright, and Dark Sakura has a few stories for us before we get to releases around the

01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:43.260
world.

01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:44.260
Ah, I do.

01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:47.260
Well, if I can make the words come out of my mouth.

01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:54.260
The next Splatfest in Japan, or Splatoon 2 Splatfest, I should say, is about Poki, as

01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:56.260
in the confection.

01:29:56.260 --> 01:30:03.260
There is regular Poki, and there is Poki Extremely Thins, which are about the girth of a spaghetti

01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:04.260
strand.

01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:07.260
And some of us, you've probably heard it pronounced Poki.

01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:09.260
Some people pronounce it like that.

01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:11.260
Yeah, because I think of Poki as in like raw fish.

01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:13.260
I think of the fish thing, yeah.

01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:14.260
That's Poki.

01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:16.260
I know, I know.

01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:17.260
But you know how we-

01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:20.260
But I'm a dumb American, so I don't understand the difference.

01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:21.260
Y'all need to speak American.

01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:25.260
Can I make spaghetti out of the Poki or whatever?

01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:30.260
Maybe Sp-Sp-Poki?

01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:34.260
So also, Team Sonic Racing has been delayed until next year.

01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:39.260
It's been pushed back to May 21st, 2019, and no one curr.

01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:45.260
I hope it's only to get the guy that did the theme song for Daytona to do the theme song

01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:46.260
for this game.

01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:48.260
I hope it's to get Danica Patrick back.

01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:50.260
Well, let's see, why not both?

01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:53.260
I really, actually, it's funny, have you ever watched that guy sing?

01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:54.260
Yeah.

01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:58.260
He's absolutely engaging to watch.

01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:02.260
Even like studio stuff, he's like, I'm totally into Brew Brew Sky.

01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:03.260
That's right.

01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:04.260
And he sang Burning Rangers.

01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:08.260
He had, didn't he team up for like F-Zero song?

01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:09.260
Yes, yes.

01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:11.260
I was like, he was just recently, we were talking about that guy.

01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:13.260
Yes, everything he touches is magic.

01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:14.260
Yeah.

01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:18.260
And SSG100Matt in our chat at live.vognetwork.com wants to point out, I care, Sonic All-Star

01:31:18.260 --> 01:31:19.260
Racing was great.

01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:23.260
I care too, but you know, you want it to be a good game.

01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:26.260
Every little thing he sings is magic.

01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:27.260
Right.

01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:30.260
Let's travel around the world and check out some upcoming releases.

01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:33.260
What you'll be buying a little sooner than Team Sonic Racing.

01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:34.260
Yes.

01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:40.260

01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:44.260

Dream Daddy, Dadrector's Cut on PS4.

01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:50.260
Which I still have never played.

01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:51.260
Is that weird?

01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:53.260
I just haven't gotten around to that.

01:31:53.260 --> 01:31:55.260
Especially since you've cosplayed.

01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:56.260
I know, right?

01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:57.260
You haven't played the game yet.

01:31:57.260 --> 01:31:58.260
Sorry to let you all down.

01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:01.260
I'm a fake, fake gamer boy.

01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:03.260
Fake gamer boy.

01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:05.260

Steven Universe Save the Light on the Switch.

01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:32.260
This one should be a little bit up Rob's alley.

01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:35.260
Diablo 3 The Eternal collection on the Switch this week.

01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:37.260
Yeah, I kind of want to get it.

01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:41.260
It's money, it's money, but I'm probably going to end up getting that anyway.

01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:43.260
And then for you music game fans,

01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:47.260
Taiko no Tatujin Drum and Fun on the Switch.

01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:48.260

Taiko no Tatujin Drum Session on PlayStation 4.

01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:53.260
That's it.

01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:54.260
Nice.

01:32:54.260 --> 01:32:56.260
Japan feels a little light this week.

01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:59.260
I'm not seeing huge releases, at least not on PlayStation 4.

01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:02.260
Transference is the only really big release from Ubisoft

01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:05.260
on November 1st this week on the PlayStation 4.

01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:08.260
Over on the Nintendo Switch,

01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:11.260
I don't think I see anything big over there either actually.

01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:14.260
Niko Tomo is the only game that I see on the Switch this week.

01:33:14.260 --> 01:33:16.260
So it seems to be a quiet week on the Switch,

01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:18.260
or excuse me, a quiet week in Japan for whatever reason.

01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:20.260
Dark Sakura.

01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:22.260
It's busy over in Europe.

01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:25.260
So starting with the 30th,

01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:27.260
we have Fallout 76 Beta.

01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:31.260
We have Call of Cthulhu for PlayStation and Xbox.

01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:34.260
Steep X Games Gold Edition.

01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:39.260
We have Sports Party The Escapist 2 for Switch.

01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:42.260
8 To Glory Bull Riding.

01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:43.260
Okay.

01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:46.260
Gungrave VR Loaded Coffin Edition.

01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:48.260
That's on the 31st.

01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:54.260
Galmetal World Tour Edition on the 31st on Switch.

01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:57.260
It looks like on November 2nd,

01:33:57.260 --> 01:34:02.260
we have Football Manager 2019.

01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:05.260
We have Mutant Football League Dynasty Edition.

01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:08.260
Steven Universe Double Pack.

01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:11.260
Looks like Diablo 3 The Eternal Collection.

01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:14.260
Taiko no Tatsujin Drum and Fun.

01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:16.260
Jeez, Mushi.

01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:18.260
This was all during the show last week,

01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:20.260
so you just have to get used to it.

01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:23.260
Lego Harry Potter Collection for Xbox and Switch.

01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:26.260
Witcher 3 Dark Souls 3 Bundle.

01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:27.260
God, there's a bunch on this.

01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:28.260
Okay, here's the last one.

01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:30.260
And Gem Smashers.

01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:31.260
There you go.

01:34:31.260 --> 01:34:33.260
All right.

01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:34.260
Well, let's move on.

01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:35.260
You know, everything I read about the cat meowing

01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:37.260
says you can't acknowledge it,

01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:40.260
because then it just teaches them that it works.

01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:41.260
It'll make it worse, yeah.

01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:42.260
It works, yeah.

01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:45.260
So, sucks, huh?

01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:47.260
I just feed Midna and she shuts up.

01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:49.260
No, I just fed this one.

01:34:49.260 --> 01:34:50.260
Anyway.

01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:52.260
I don't know, usually I just get Midna in my lap

01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:53.260
and she shuts up.

01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:56.260
SSG100Matt says Mr. Smoosh wants to do release dates.

01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:57.260
Maybe that's what it is.

01:34:57.260 --> 01:34:58.260
Maybe Mr. Smoosh is coming for your...

01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:00.260
He's gonna release his poop.

01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:03.260
As long as he does it in the litter box, fine.

01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:05.260
SSG100Matt suggests that Mr. Smoosh

01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:08.260
gets Australian release dates.

01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:11.260
That might not be a bad idea.

01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:12.260
Coming out this week.

01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:13.260
Meow.

01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:14.260
And meow.

01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:15.260
Oh, good.

01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:17.260
Other dad is home and can hopefully take care

01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:20.260
of Mr. Smoosh's insensitive meowing.

01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:21.260
All right, anyway.

01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:22.260
He's singing us the song of his people.

01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:23.260
That's right.

01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:24.260
All right.

01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:25.260
Let's move on to the mailbag,

01:35:25.260 --> 01:35:27.260
because every week you guys send us e-mails

01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:29.260
to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:32.260
I'm quite pleased with how clean the mailbox was.

01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:33.260
Yes.

01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:35.260
I... because I knew you would bellyache

01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:37.260
if I didn't move everything to trash.

01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:38.260
Meow.

01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:39.260
Meow.

01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:40.260
Exactly.

01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:41.260
Meow.

01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:42.260
Meow.

01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:43.260
See, I speak Smoosh.

01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:45.260
Uh, Darce Acro, what is in the mailbag?

01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:47.260
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:48.260
is the e-mail address.

01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:50.260
From our own Raginator.

01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:51.260
Hi, everyone.

01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:52.260
As opposed to someone else's.

01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:53.260
Someone else's Raginator.

01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:54.260
Sorry, Raginator.

01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:55.260
We're giving you to someone else.

01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:56.260
You can't be ours anymore.

01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:57.260
Kidding.

01:35:57.260 --> 01:35:58.260
Hi, everyone.

01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:00.260
Just writing this very last second e-mail

01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:02.260
to pose a long-winded question

01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:04.260
that is arising from a shitstorm

01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:06.260
that occurred this weekend.

01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:08.260
I'm trying to help someone come up with ideas

01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:10.260
for a video streaming service.

01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:12.260
She does cosplay for cons and photoshoots.

01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:13.260
Twitch is out.

01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:16.260
Um, skipping, skipping, skipping.

01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:19.260
Um, she ruled out YouTube,

01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:21.260
saying that their streaming is shit.

01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:25.260
Uh, Mixer, from what I've been told, has issues.

01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:27.260
That being said, can you think of any alternatives?

01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:30.260
If need be, we can discuss this more off-air

01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:32.260
if you need more info or details.

01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:34.260
Normally, I would just close an e-mail

01:36:34.260 --> 01:36:35.260
with my brand of humor,

01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:36.260
but this time, I'll skip the humor

01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:37.260
and just say this.

01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:39.260
Slash kitty, you have my full support,

01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:41.260
and I will do what I can to help.

01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:44.260
Um, doesn't Vimeo do, like, streaming, too?

01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:45.260
Yes.

01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:48.260
And first off, in response to talking about it off-air,

01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:50.260
there's only gonna be, like, two people to get this joke,

01:36:50.260 --> 01:36:52.260
but, Raginator, nothing you ask matters

01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:54.260
unless that audio is rolling.

01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:55.260
You get the joke, Jamie?

01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:57.260
All right, anyway, it's a Drag Race reference.

01:36:57.260 --> 01:37:00.260
Anyway, um, I know, Loki, you're not supposed to get it.

01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:03.260
All right, anyway, uh, in all seriousness,

01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:06.260
uh, yeah, Vimeo, I guess, is one.

01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:08.260
I mean, gosh, cutting yourself out of YouTube,

01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:10.260
that is a big chunk of it.

01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:14.260
Um, here's, I mean,

01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:16.260
I'm gonna give you an honest answer,

01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:18.260
and I'm not saying this to sound, like, skeezy

01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:21.260
or anything like that, but OnlyFans,

01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:24.260
and I realize that is a usually thing

01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:26.260
associated with pornography.

01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:28.260
I'm bringing it up because I'm not gonna shame sex workers.

01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:30.260
I don't know if that is anything at all remotely

01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:32.260
that the person is interested in,

01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:34.260
but it doesn't have to be that.

01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:36.260
So, like, I know a podcast I listen to

01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:39.260
is kinda half talking about doing something with OnlyFans,

01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:41.260
so, I mean, just, I just thrown it out there as an option.

01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:43.260
It is an option.

01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:46.260
Um, maybe, doesn't Patreon allow you

01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:49.260
to unlock video stuff on there?

01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:51.260
But I don't think it's streaming.

01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:54.260
Oh, I thought they had, like, a built-in VOD thing,

01:37:54.260 --> 01:37:56.260
but you had to, like, actually pay for the Patreon

01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:57.260
in order to see it.

01:37:57.260 --> 01:37:59.260
I don't know, I'm not gonna really use it.

01:37:59.260 --> 01:38:01.260
Wait, what are we, streaming adult content?

01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:03.260
No, no, no, no, no, I, no, just, like,

01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:05.260
not necessarily.

01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:07.260
My answer kinda got into that

01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:09.260
because if that's something somebody wants to do,

01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:12.260
then go for it, but I don't think it was specifically that.

01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:14.260
I think it was just cosplay, featuring,

01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:16.260
and things like that.

01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:18.260
I mean, if it were me doing that,

01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:21.260
I wouldn't stream cosplay stuff at all.

01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:25.260
I would do more of the Instagram route.

01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:26.260
I don't know.

01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:28.260
Oh, Instagram's a great idea, actually.

01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:29.260
But you can do video,

01:38:29.260 --> 01:38:32.260
and you can do live stuff on Instagram and Facebook.

01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:34.260
And they have that new Instagram TV thing, too.

01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:35.260
So, there's that.

01:38:35.260 --> 01:38:37.260
Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.

01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:38.260
Good suggestion.

01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:40.260
Um, and then also, uh, D'Artezia suggests

01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:42.260
is Ustream still around?

01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:44.260
I thought maybe it was, like,

01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:46.260
I thought maybe it shut down at some point.

01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:48.260
I think they're still there because of, uh,

01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:51.260
the PlayStation will still let you stream there, won't it?

01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:52.260
And that would be,

01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:55.260
Dailymotion would be, uh, part of that as well.

01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:56.260
So, I think, uh,

01:38:56.260 --> 01:38:59.260
the PlayStation 4 officially supports all those, uh, platforms,

01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:01.260
even though they're not as common.

01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:03.260
And I don't know, like, as far as what,

01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:06.260
what type of, like, account, like,

01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:09.260
you know, what offerings you're talking about here,

01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:12.260
but, like, I know there's, like, subreddits and stuff

01:39:12.260 --> 01:39:14.260
where people offer stuff like that,

01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:17.260
and, like, photos and, you know, stuff where they can sell.

01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:19.260
And I don't know what services they use,

01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:20.260
but you can always see,

01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:22.260
hey, what are you using for your shit?

01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:24.260
And use the same thing.

01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:26.260
Yeah, I think Instagram was really the best suggestion

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:28.260
because, um, I know Aria Snark,

01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:30.260
who does a lot of cosplay that was hosting

01:39:30.260 --> 01:39:32.260
Shaking and Crying with Me for a while.

01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:34.260
She's been building and building on Instagram

01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:35.260
and doing very well.

01:39:35.260 --> 01:39:37.260
There's a few other cosplayers that I follow.

01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:39.260
Um, in fact, I'm, you know,

01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:41.260
as soon as I get back to learning my DMs,

01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:43.260
learning my damn sewing machine,

01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:45.260
my own cosplay is gonna be going up there

01:39:45.260 --> 01:39:47.260
under its own account, which, by the way,

01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:49.260
you can follow me on Instagram as DarkSakura.

01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:51.260
You can follow Midna as Batittles.

01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:53.260
Uh, TigerClaw says Ustream is around,

01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:55.260
but it's no longer called Ustream.

01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:57.260
It's IBM Cloud Video.

01:39:57.260 --> 01:39:59.260
IBM's buying all this shit, aren't they?

01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:01.260
They just bought Red Hat, too.

01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:03.260
There you go. Microsoft just acquired GitHub.

01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:05.260
Everything, everything's been bought.

01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:07.260
Did you know that DreamWorks used to do all of their, um,

01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:10.260
proprietary rendering software in, um, Red Hat?

01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:12.260
I know now.

01:40:12.260 --> 01:40:14.260
I got to speak with somebody who graduated from my college

01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:16.260
and went on to work for DreamWorks

01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:18.260
and worked on the Sherman and Peabody movie.

01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:20.260
Oh. And I asked them about their rendering software.

01:40:20.260 --> 01:40:22.260
He's like, yeah, it all runs in Red Hat, and it's proprietary.

01:40:22.260 --> 01:40:24.260
Huh. Cool. How about that?

01:40:24.260 --> 01:40:25.260
You learn something every day.

01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:26.260
All right, if that's it for emails,

01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:28.260
I'll encourage you to send more emails.

01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:30.260
Participate at orangelandtrader.com

01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:32.260
is the place to send emails in the future.

01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:34.260
In the meantime, we've got some more news stories

01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:37.260
for you guys, and we'll get to our Skype line eventually.

01:40:37.260 --> 01:40:39.260
Loki, what do you have for us?

01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:41.260
Well, VR's canceled.

01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:43.260
No, just kidding.

01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:45.260
Um, so apparently the, um,

01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:50.260
there is rumors that the Rift 2 is canceled,

01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:52.260
and apparently the co-founder of Oculus

01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:55.260
has left the company as well.

01:40:55.260 --> 01:40:57.260
Now, what this would necessarily mean

01:40:57.260 --> 01:40:59.260
is not necessarily that they're gonna stop

01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:01.260
development of the Oculus Rift.

01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:04.260
It's just that what was currently the Rift 2

01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:06.260
is now not being worked on,

01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:08.260
and I'm probably in part with the fact

01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:11.260
that they've done stuff like, so the Oculus, um,

01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:12.260
what the hell was the last Oculus

01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:14.260
that they put out, the standalone one?

01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:15.260
I don't remember what the fuck it's called.

01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:18.260
But, um, they have other Oculus products

01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:20.260
that are gonna be available instead.

01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:23.260
So, um, Michael Abrash basically said that,

01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:26.260
you know, these are the good, these are the good old days,

01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:30.260
um, when they're talking about, like, you know,

01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:33.260
as far as how VR has come along.

01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:36.260
Um, but now, of course, you know, with that,

01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:39.260
they're gonna be pushing for new hardware,

01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:41.260
maybe going in even a different direction

01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:43.260
with stuff like that, you know, um,

01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:46.260
the brand new Oculus headset that they have as standalone.

01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:48.260
I'm curious to see, like, what's gonna run on that,

01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:49.260
because I know they have, like,

01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:51.260
was it the whole Vader thing,

01:41:51.260 --> 01:41:54.260
but, like, what else can it do?

01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:57.260
Is it, how is this gonna, like, tie in with Facebook again,

01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:59.260
you know, with, are they gonna be doing, like,

01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:01.260
you know, some sort of VR Facebook crap on there?

01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:03.260
I don't know if this is directly related,

01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:05.260
but I will say one thing that I've been saying

01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:07.260
and the one thing that I've been super into

01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:09.260
that I think is neat on Facebook lately,

01:42:09.260 --> 01:42:11.260
and I know Dark Soccer's feeling this too,

01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:14.260
is that they just enabled those 3D photos,

01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:18.260
and if you have a phone that has basically two lenses,

01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:22.260
so I know any iPhone, uh, past seven will do it,

01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:26.260
because if your phone can do the portrait thing on iPhone,

01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:27.260
I don't know what the Android equivalent is,

01:42:27.260 --> 01:42:29.260
but it's just, like, basically just two,

01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:30.260
it has to have, like, one camera

01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:32.260
and a depth perception lens as well.

01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:34.260
It's called the knockoff.

01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:35.260
Yeah, well, you know.

01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:38.260
Um, but anyway, as long as your phone has that

01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:39.260
and that data's in the picture,

01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:42.260
you can post these 3D pictures to Facebook.

01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:43.260
They're weird, though.

01:42:43.260 --> 01:42:44.260
Yeah, they're kinda trippy.

01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:47.260
But it, did you see the one I did of my, uh, tea mug?

01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:48.260
I don't think I saw that one.

01:42:48.260 --> 01:42:49.260
Yeah, it kinda got jacked up on that.

01:42:49.260 --> 01:42:52.260
Yeah, the, basically, because it's clear glass

01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:56.260
and the top part of the mug ended up foreground,

01:42:56.260 --> 01:42:57.260
and then, of the handle,

01:42:57.260 --> 01:42:59.260
and then the bottom half that was lighter

01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:02.260
ended up as background, so it's, like, it's split apart.

01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:03.260
Okay, that's trippy.

01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:04.260
Let me really quickly read the whole excerpt

01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:06.260
that he put in his Facebook post.

01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:07.260
So, so much has happened since the day

01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:10.260
we found out Oculus in 2012, or July 2012.

01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:13.260
I never could have imagined how much we would accomplish

01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:14.260
and how far we would come,

01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:17.260
and now, after six incredible years, I am moving on.

01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:18.260
I am deeply proud and grateful

01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:20.260
for all that we have done together.

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:21.260
We have assembled one of the greatest

01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:23.260
research and engineering teams in history,

01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:26.260
delivered the first step of true virtual presence

01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:28.260
with Oculus Rift in touch,

01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:30.260
and inspired an entirely new industry.

01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:33.260
We started a revolution that will change the world

01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:35.260
in ways we can only envision.

01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:39.260
Yet, as far as we've come, the journey has just begun.

01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:43.260
You know, basically talking about the good old days.

01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:45.260
And then, now, when we pioneer the foundation

01:43:45.260 --> 01:43:48.260
for the next great computing platform and medium,

01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:50.260
this is our time to be pushing state-of-the-art

01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:51.260
onward and upward.

01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:54.260
Every part of AR, VR needs to improve,

01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:56.260
especially the hardware and core technology.

01:43:56.260 --> 01:43:59.260
So, I think it sounds to me like the frustration

01:43:59.260 --> 01:44:02.260
may have been that, you know, now we have this,

01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:04.260
I don't know, maybe the standalone software.

01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:05.260
I think he's expecting more.

01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:08.260
Maybe we're just not pushing it enough.

01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:09.260
But I still think they need to get

01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:10.260
the kind of saturation out there first

01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:12.260
before we're really pushing the technology,

01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:14.260
but maybe doing both at the same time.

01:44:14.260 --> 01:44:15.260
Yeah.

01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:16.260
Because how do you make it affordable

01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:18.260
and entry-level for people to get into it,

01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:21.260
to get wanting more as far out of the hardware and everything?

01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:22.260
Right.

01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:23.260
I don't know.

01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:24.260
And, obviously, Facebook acquiring this

01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:27.260
was never really about only games.

01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:28.260
Although, you know, it's interesting

01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:30.260
talking about kind of like other moves

01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:33.260
that Facebook makes and how it might relate to this

01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:34.260
because, you know, we just talked about

01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:36.260
the 3D pictures thing and how, actually,

01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:38.260
I find that stuff to be really fascinating.

01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:40.260
I mean, it's still got issues,

01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:42.260
like Darcy points out with her tea mug picture,

01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:44.260
but, like, the picture I posted of, like,

01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:47.260
Mr. Smoosh lying down in 3D got, like, a ton of feedback

01:44:47.260 --> 01:44:49.260
because people were like, that is so cool.

01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:51.260
And, like, it was just a normal picture

01:44:51.260 --> 01:44:53.260
I took in portrait mode because you can go back

01:44:53.260 --> 01:44:55.260
to any picture in your library that you took in the past

01:44:55.260 --> 01:44:57.260
in portrait mode and it'll run its filter on it,

01:44:57.260 --> 01:44:58.260
which is really cool.

01:44:58.260 --> 01:45:02.260
So, anyway, you know, but I noticed one thing,

01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:03.260
and this is annoying me about Facebook,

01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:05.260
is that now, like, every time I open up

01:45:05.260 --> 01:45:07.260
Facebook on my phone, the games thing lights up

01:45:07.260 --> 01:45:10.260
with, like, you have one notification in games.

01:45:10.260 --> 01:45:11.260
You have this in games.

01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:12.260
It's like, I don't, like, I really wish

01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:14.260
I could just, like, get rid of that or uninstall it

01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:16.260
because I'm not interested in doing games.

01:45:16.260 --> 01:45:20.260
It's going back to the whole, remember when people

01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:22.260
get super fucking annoyed at this on Facebook

01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:25.260
when it's like a friend has sent you something in Farmville.

01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:26.260
A friend needs you to get their farm

01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:28.260
in Farmville, so you get, like, 20 of those requests.

01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:29.260
Yeah, I remember blocking all that shit.

01:45:29.260 --> 01:45:32.260
Like, I feel like Facebook is, like, coming back to that,

01:45:32.260 --> 01:45:34.260
but it's Facebook's own shit where it's like

01:45:34.260 --> 01:45:36.260
you have a post in a new gaming community.

01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:37.260
No, I get that all the time and, like,

01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:39.260
I've turned off notifications for most everything.

01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:42.260
I don't need to know when someone's posted a picture

01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:43.260
or something like that unless I'm, like,

01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:46.260
specifically choosing to be notified by that,

01:45:46.260 --> 01:45:48.260
but they keep doing that.

01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:49.260
Like, oh, you have a notification.

01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:51.260
It's like, oh, such and such has posted something

01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:52.260
on their Instagram feed.

01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:54.260
I don't fucking care about Instagram.

01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:55.260
I'm on Facebook.

01:45:55.260 --> 01:45:57.260
I don't give a shit about that.

01:45:57.260 --> 01:45:59.260
Or I, this person's posted a photo

01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:02.260
or this person's posted a comment or, like, an update.

01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:04.260
Who cares?

01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:05.260
I don't care.

01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:07.260
If I wanted to be notified by that,

01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:12.260
I would set my notifications to be like that.

01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:14.260
All right, yeah, I just, that's the type of crap

01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:16.260
that's gonna just annoy me with Facebook

01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:18.260
and make me just uninstall it for my phone again,

01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:20.260
but it's like, it's a double-edged sword

01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:22.260
because, you know, where else am I gonna show people

01:46:22.260 --> 01:46:24.260
the picture of me dressed up as sexy?

01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:26.260
Which was my Halloween costume, by the way,

01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:27.260
if you weren't already aware.

01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:28.260
So, and then, of course, to go back to...

01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:30.260
Where's your Miss Peacock shoes?

01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:31.260
They were my Miss Peacock shoes.

01:46:31.260 --> 01:46:33.260
If I'm gonna, girl, if I'm gonna spend $40

01:46:33.260 --> 01:46:34.260
on a pair of heels,

01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:35.260
you know I'm gonna wear them more than once.

01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:37.260
So, to go back to the article real quick.

01:46:37.260 --> 01:46:39.260
So, the actual reason that he left is,

01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:41.260
basically, he had fundamentally different views

01:46:41.260 --> 01:46:44.260
of the future of Oculus that grew deeper over time

01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:47.260
and wasn't interested in the race to the bottom.

01:46:47.260 --> 01:46:49.260
So, it sounds like, you know,

01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:52.260
maybe the race to make it cheaper, more affordable.

01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:53.260
I don't know.

01:46:53.260 --> 01:46:55.260
He wants to really push the VR hardware,

01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:58.260
which, you know, I'm kind of on board with that.

01:46:58.260 --> 01:47:00.260
But, at the same time, I understand why they have to

01:47:00.260 --> 01:47:02.260
because you gotta get people interested in it

01:47:02.260 --> 01:47:05.260
in order to push this high-end hardware.

01:47:05.260 --> 01:47:06.260
Yeah.

01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:07.260
All right.

01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:10.260
Well, we'll see what the future is gonna hold for this.

01:47:10.260 --> 01:47:13.260
I don't think, necessarily, that, you know,

01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:15.260
Facebook is just, like, totally getting out of VR,

01:47:15.260 --> 01:47:17.260
but maybe it's not gonna be, like, kind of like,

01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:21.260
it's, like, not necessarily a race to outdo Vive

01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:24.260
and PlayStation VR, which are starting to cement themselves

01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:25.260
as more like the gaming options.

01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:27.260
I really wish PlayStation would come out with some new

01:47:27.260 --> 01:47:29.260
goddamn, like, controllers for that shit

01:47:29.260 --> 01:47:31.260
because those move controllers are...

01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:34.260
I would assume, and it's the biggest assumption,

01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:36.260
but I would assume any of that type of stuff

01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:38.260
is being rolled over to PlayStation 5

01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:41.260
and how VR might work with PlayStation 5 at this point.

01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:44.260
So, speaking of PlayStation VR...

01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:46.260
I have not played it yet.

01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:48.260
Shame on you!

01:47:48.260 --> 01:47:49.260
I just...

01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:50.260
Shame!

01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:52.260
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:54.260
We're, what, two weeks out from Tetris Effect?

01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:55.260
Yes.

01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:56.260
So, it's gonna happen.

01:47:56.260 --> 01:47:58.260
So, I am excited.

01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:01.260
I actually was listening to the soundtrack of Tetris Effect

01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:02.260
the other day.

01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:03.260
It's so good.

01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:04.260
Oh, yeah, they have a soundtrack online?

01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:06.260
Yeah, because if you pre-order it, you get the soundtrack.

01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:07.260
And somebody put it all on YouTube.

01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:08.260
It's great.

01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:09.260
I do need to pre-order and get the soundtrack.

01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:10.260
Yeah, it's great.

01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:11.260
All right.

01:48:11.260 --> 01:48:13.260
Let's get into some stories on Pokemon Go.

01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:15.260
The first story, which I know you guys love it

01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:17.260
when we talk about it, but, you know,

01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:19.260
it's kind of a big deal,

01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:21.260
and this one was something Loki kind of referenced

01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:25.260
a little bit ago, is that Niantic is going to be

01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:27.260
unveiling an adventure sink.

01:48:27.260 --> 01:48:29.260
They're calling it a Niantic real-world platform

01:48:29.260 --> 01:48:31.260
gameplay system that gives players

01:48:31.260 --> 01:48:33.260
more reason to go outside.

01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:36.260
So, basically, what you're gonna be doing with this

01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:38.260
is that it will kind of tie together

01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:42.260
with the health monitors in your phone, I guess,

01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:45.260
to actually give you credit for walking eggs

01:48:45.260 --> 01:48:47.260
and things of that sort,

01:48:47.260 --> 01:48:51.260
which is something that you get the credit

01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:53.260
for the egg walking and all that,

01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:55.260
but it's tied into the health apps

01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:56.260
that are already on your phone.

01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:58.260
Well, yeah, and I saw that, and I hope that's the case

01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:00.260
because I use those.

01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:01.260
I don't know.

01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:05.260
I think it was just a Samsung Fit or the Android Fit.

01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:08.260
It's Android Google Fit, and it's iOS Health Kit.

01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:10.260
All of my stuff ties into my health app.

01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:11.260
Right, and that's just the watch.

01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:13.260
I don't know if I used Android Fit.

01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:14.260
I used the Fitbit stuff.

01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:15.260
I think that ties in with Android.

01:49:15.260 --> 01:49:16.260
I'm sure it does.

01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:17.260
It should, but I don't know if there are issues.

01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:20.260
Now Pokemon goes working again on the Apple Watch.

01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:21.260
Oh, does the Apple Watch?

01:49:21.260 --> 01:49:23.260
The Apple Watch thing has never worked for me.

01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:25.260
It's been pretty okay.

01:49:25.260 --> 01:49:27.260
I don't need it because I have the Gotcha,

01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:29.260
but I do like that the watch...

01:49:29.260 --> 01:49:31.260
But I like this for tracking my walking.

01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:32.260
Yeah, the watch tracks your...

01:49:32.260 --> 01:49:35.260
You know what's funny is that before I got the watch,

01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:36.260
I was very much like, I don't need an Apple Watch.

01:49:36.260 --> 01:49:37.260
I don't do any of that stuff,

01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:39.260
but then the exercise stuff kind of pulled me in,

01:49:39.260 --> 01:49:41.260
and I really do like that it shows me,

01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:43.260
like, oh, this is how much you've moved today.

01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:45.260
Get up off your butt and do some walking

01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:46.260
because you haven't really done any.

01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:47.260
Mine reminds me to stand up

01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:49.260
instead of just getting so locked up in my work.

01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:50.260
Yeah, and...

01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:51.260
But now you know why I stand up

01:49:51.260 --> 01:49:52.260
like every hour during the show.

01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:53.260
Oh, for sure. No, because I...

01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:55.260
Well, I'd already hit my 12 hours before

01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:56.260
because I don't...

01:49:56.260 --> 01:49:58.260
My phone stops reminding me after 12 hours.

01:49:58.260 --> 01:50:00.260
It doesn't remind me anymore.

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:02.260
Yeah, mine goes from about nine to six.

01:50:02.260 --> 01:50:03.260
It will stop.

01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:06.260
But then, you know, the other thing, though,

01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:09.260
is that I'm also doing this mindfulness challenge at work

01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:13.260
where I think, like, the goal is to, like, do, like...

01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:16.260
What is it? 25 days at minimum?

01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:17.260
Mm-hmm.

01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:20.260
To do the meditation for 10 minutes,

01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:21.260
the breathing, the mindful breathing.

01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:22.260
Yeah.

01:50:22.260 --> 01:50:24.260
And I've done every day this month.

01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:25.260
That's great.

01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:27.260
Now, supposedly, this feature

01:50:27.260 --> 01:50:29.260
is also going to let you have challenges,

01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:31.260
kind of work with friends.

01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:33.260
There's going to be more stuff in the game,

01:50:33.260 --> 01:50:35.260
so it isn't enabled in the game yet.

01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:38.260
So as Joe and Hunter Matt in chat asks,

01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:39.260
so in order for this to work,

01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:42.260
you need to have background data enabled on Pokemon Go.

01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:43.260
If it's going through other apps,

01:50:43.260 --> 01:50:44.260
I wonder if it does anymore.

01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:46.260
I don't think it does.

01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:47.260
Unfortunately, we're just not going to have

01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:49.260
a lot of answers to these questions

01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:50.260
until the feature comes out

01:50:50.260 --> 01:50:53.260
and those people on Silf Road tear it apart

01:50:53.260 --> 01:50:54.260
in five minutes.

01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:55.260
I don't think it's going to have background data.

01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:56.260
It's probably going to be just,

01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:58.260
okay, you launch this app,

01:50:58.260 --> 01:51:00.260
or the last time you launched this app was here,

01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:03.260
and how many steps or whatever distance you've covered

01:51:03.260 --> 01:51:04.260
between them.

01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:05.260
And it's going to pull that from the health app.

01:51:05.260 --> 01:51:09.260
It's just like, yeah, it's like I use my fitness coach

01:51:09.260 --> 01:51:10.260
for logging my food,

01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:12.260
and I use my Fitbit app for everything else,

01:51:12.260 --> 01:51:13.260
for activity-wise.

01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:15.260
I kind of separate them that way.

01:51:15.260 --> 01:51:16.260
I don't know why.

01:51:16.260 --> 01:51:17.260
I just do it that way.

01:51:17.260 --> 01:51:20.260
Now, Rama's trying to give you some Android advice,

01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:22.260
because DarkStalker and I can't really help there.

01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:24.260
Rama in chat says you have to open the Google Fit app

01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:26.260
and have it sync the Fitbit app.

01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:29.260
Yeah, I was just about to download it,

01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:31.260
because I don't have it installed on my phone.

01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:32.260
Get on that.

01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:34.260
Hatch them eggs.

01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:37.260
But I have so many fitness trackers.

01:51:37.260 --> 01:51:39.260
Niantic will just sell more incubators

01:51:39.260 --> 01:51:41.260
so they're all about this, I'm sure.

01:51:41.260 --> 01:51:44.260
But I imagine this feature will probably be unlocked

01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:45.260
at some point in the next week.

01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:47.260
I don't know if they're going to make us wait

01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:48.260
all the way until the Halloween event is over,

01:51:48.260 --> 01:51:50.260
but we shall see.

01:51:50.260 --> 01:51:53.260
So lots of news around Pokémon GO right now.

01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:55.260
Not all of it good, right, DarkStalker?

01:51:55.260 --> 01:51:57.260
Fuck that.

01:51:57.260 --> 01:52:00.260
Yeah, so Niantic posted on their Twitter,

01:52:00.260 --> 01:52:04.260
Trainers in Arizona come join the Autism Speaks Walk

01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:08.260
on October 28th and raise money for SARRC,

01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:10.260
which provides research, treatment, education,

01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:12.260
and community outreach for people with autism.

01:52:12.260 --> 01:52:14.260
First of all, fuck Autism Speaks.

01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:16.260
Fuck them, fuck them, fuck them.

01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:19.260
It wasn't until this year that they finally got

01:52:19.260 --> 01:52:21.260
an autistic person on their board.

01:52:21.260 --> 01:52:25.260
They spent decades sharing misinformation

01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:27.260
and treating us like we have a disease,

01:52:27.260 --> 01:52:30.260
instead of this just being how our brains are wired.

01:52:30.260 --> 01:52:37.260
They advocate the ADA, which is like this behavioral therapy.

01:52:37.260 --> 01:52:38.260
ABA.

01:52:38.260 --> 01:52:39.260
ABA, sorry.

01:52:39.260 --> 01:52:41.260
It's this behavioral therapy that, in some cases,

01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:45.260
have been borderline abusive to kids.

01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:48.260
I'm sure there are some places that do it better,

01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:51.260
but a lot of times I will just see, like,

01:52:51.260 --> 01:52:53.260
completely outrageous things that are done against children.

01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:55.260
And then they, you know, started putting out

01:52:55.260 --> 01:53:00.260
all of these videos and this propaganda, really,

01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:03.260
that were saying that people with autism

01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:06.260
are a danger to their parents and a burden

01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:08.260
and that we need to be, quote, cured.

01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:11.260
Fuck that, fuck that noise, and fuck you Niantic

01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:14.260
for not doing any goddamn research

01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:19.260
and working with a good place like ASAN,

01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:21.260
the Autism Self Advocacy Network,

01:53:21.260 --> 01:53:24.260
and any of these other places that are not just

01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:26.260
this money-grabbing shithole.

01:53:26.260 --> 01:53:28.260
They are on par with the Komen Foundation.

01:53:28.260 --> 01:53:30.260
They are just completely terrible.

01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:33.260
Do not give Autism Speaks any of your money,

01:53:33.260 --> 01:53:39.260
and if you are in Arizona, please do not support this event.

01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:42.260
Give your money to a good service

01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:45.260
that will do good things for people with autism.

01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:48.260
Now Niantic did seem to acknowledge some of the feedback,

01:53:48.260 --> 01:53:51.260
but I got the sense they kind of had to do it in a way

01:53:51.260 --> 01:53:53.260
that they weren't going to pull out of the event,

01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:55.260
but they may not be able to.

01:53:55.260 --> 01:53:57.260
Honestly, it may be at the point where it's kind of like

01:53:57.260 --> 01:53:59.260
once you commit something, you can't really do it.

01:53:59.260 --> 01:54:01.260
You can't really necessarily just yank yourself out,

01:54:01.260 --> 01:54:03.260
especially if the check's already been cashed.

01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:05.260
But I remember seeing a tweet from them that kind of said,

01:54:05.260 --> 01:54:07.260
we heard your feedback, and we look forward to working

01:54:07.260 --> 01:54:09.260
with other charities in the future.

01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:11.260
We want to hear your feedback on what charities

01:54:11.260 --> 01:54:13.260
we should be working with type of thing.

01:54:13.260 --> 01:54:15.260
That's kind of what I drew from it.

01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:20.260
But I guess for maybe folks that don't totally like,

01:54:20.260 --> 01:54:23.260
because this is a good comparison in my head

01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:27.260
to kind of understand where your anger comes from,

01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:32.260
is that this would be if Niantic got an offer on their desk

01:54:32.260 --> 01:54:37.260
that says, we want you to sign up for this charity

01:54:37.260 --> 01:54:39.260
that helps gay children.

01:54:39.260 --> 01:54:41.260
This charity helps gay children,

01:54:41.260 --> 01:54:43.260
and we want you to be a partner in this

01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:46.260
so we can raise money to help gay children.

01:54:46.260 --> 01:54:48.260
And Niantic probably thinks, oh, that sounds like,

01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:50.260
you're right, there's so many gay kids out there

01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:52.260
that get kicked out of their homes,

01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:55.260
and they need a place to go, and we want to help.

01:54:55.260 --> 01:54:57.260
You're right, we should sign off on that,

01:54:57.260 --> 01:54:59.260
because that sounds good, and that's doing good.

01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:02.260
And then it turns out, what did this charity mean

01:55:02.260 --> 01:55:04.260
when they say, help gay children?

01:55:04.260 --> 01:55:06.260
It's conversion therapy.

01:55:06.260 --> 01:55:08.260
It's conversion therapy, electroshock therapy,

01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:10.260
or something like that, right?

01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:12.260
Is that a fair comparison to where your anger comes from

01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:14.260
when you talk about Autism Speaks?

01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:16.260
Is that it's like...

01:55:16.260 --> 01:55:19.260
Probably not in that level of extreme,

01:55:19.260 --> 01:55:24.260
but it's just where the place that they're coming from is.

01:55:25.260 --> 01:55:28.260
Is that they treat us like we're a disease.

01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:31.260
Like, there's something wrong with us to cure.

01:55:31.260 --> 01:55:34.260
And neurodivergence is not a disease.

01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:36.260
It is how your brain is wired.

01:55:36.260 --> 01:55:39.260
And there are a lot of us who function perfectly fine in the world.

01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:41.260
I mean, there's a lot of nonverbal people.

01:55:41.260 --> 01:55:44.260
There's a lot of people who just completely cannot function.

01:55:44.260 --> 01:55:47.260
Those people could probably use more assistance.

01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:50.260
But what we need a lot is people to understand

01:55:50.260 --> 01:55:52.260
that not everyone is going to approach things

01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:55.260
from the same point of view that you do.

01:55:56.260 --> 01:55:59.260
It takes multiple levels of thought

01:55:59.260 --> 01:56:02.260
and thought processes to make the world work.

01:56:02.260 --> 01:56:05.260
If you are finding that you can't communicate with someone with autism,

01:56:05.260 --> 01:56:07.260
maybe you should change how you talk

01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:10.260
instead of asking them to rewire themselves.

01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:14.260
How does Niantic get themselves out of this hole that they've dug

01:56:14.260 --> 01:56:17.260
with especially the autistic community?

01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:20.260
Short of pulling out.

01:56:20.260 --> 01:56:23.260
Let's say checks been cashed.

01:56:23.260 --> 01:56:25.260
Pulling out at this point is not an option.

01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:28.260
So short of that, what can they do to fix this?

01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:30.260
Not work with Autism Speaks again.

01:56:30.260 --> 01:56:32.260
I mean, ever again.

01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:35.260
I did find the two posts that they made about that,

01:56:35.260 --> 01:56:37.260
so I'll just read them real quick.

01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:41.260
They basically left out all mention of Autism Speaks now.

01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:45.260
We're excited to support the SARRC in their walk,

01:56:46.260 --> 01:56:48.260
which is directly benefiting the school,

01:56:48.260 --> 01:56:51.260
and appreciate the response that many of you had about the event.

01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:53.260
If you want to read more about them and their work,

01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:55.260
we encourage you to learn here, autismcenter.org.

01:56:55.260 --> 01:56:59.260
So that I think they are separating themselves from Autism Speaks already,

01:56:59.260 --> 01:57:01.260
which is good.

01:57:01.260 --> 01:57:03.260
And then the second thing was the one that you said.

01:57:03.260 --> 01:57:05.260
We hear and appreciate all the feedback

01:57:05.260 --> 01:57:07.260
as well as the other recommendations for autism organizations

01:57:07.260 --> 01:57:09.260
that you'd love to see supported.

01:57:09.260 --> 01:57:13.260
So please continue to share some of the organizations you're close to.

01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:16.260
So I think that they are realizing

01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:19.260
that they did dig themselves into a pile of shit,

01:57:19.260 --> 01:57:25.260
and are really just...

01:57:27.260 --> 01:57:31.260
I will say to Niantic's somewhat credit,

01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:33.260
not in this situation certainly,

01:57:33.260 --> 01:57:38.260
but it is nice to see Niantic wanting to use their game to benefit charities.

01:57:38.260 --> 01:57:41.260
It's a worthy... I mean, they've just got to get the right charities.

01:57:42.260 --> 01:57:47.260
One person that posted something in a response

01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:50.260
is actually exactly how I feel.

01:57:50.260 --> 01:57:52.260
And the thing is that they're still not acknowledging

01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:56.260
that SARRC still has ties to Autism Speaks.

01:57:56.260 --> 01:58:01.260
Rewording it isn't going to completely change this.

01:58:01.260 --> 01:58:05.260
Especially the fact that Autism Speaks actually has a background

01:58:05.260 --> 01:58:09.260
in being involved in eugenics programs.

01:58:09.260 --> 01:58:12.260
And has for a while. It's completely disgusting.

01:58:12.260 --> 01:58:14.260
But here's the response I like.

01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:18.260
This is Shiroko Spooky at Yomacon.

01:58:18.260 --> 01:58:21.260
I'm extremely disturbed to think that you'd financially support

01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:24.260
or promote an organization dedicated to erasing people like me

01:58:24.260 --> 01:58:28.260
through quote prevention via keeping autistic babies

01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:30.260
from even being born simply because they're autistic

01:58:30.260 --> 01:58:34.260
and quote treatment via shock therapy and worse.

01:58:34.260 --> 01:58:37.260
So taking Autism Speaks out of it,

01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:40.260
and still using another organization that works closely with them,

01:58:40.260 --> 01:58:43.260
I don't want any of my money going to this.

01:58:43.260 --> 01:58:48.260
So when the event is over, I will buy stuff again.

01:58:48.260 --> 01:58:52.260
But I'm going to make 100% positive that there has been no association

01:58:52.260 --> 01:58:55.260
if I start giving them money again.

01:58:55.260 --> 01:58:59.260
Because they're not getting a cent from me until this is over.

01:58:59.260 --> 01:59:02.260
Getting some comments from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:03.260
Rama in chat says,

01:59:03.260 --> 01:59:06.260
I don't think Niantic really knew how bad Autism Speaks really is.

01:59:06.260 --> 01:59:07.260
S2100matt says,

01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:09.260
I think Niantic's heart was in the right place,

01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:11.260
but they just didn't do the proper research.

01:59:11.260 --> 01:59:12.260
They've learned their lesson now.

01:59:12.260 --> 01:59:15.260
Well, your brain needs to be in the right place.

01:59:15.260 --> 01:59:16.260
Time will see.

01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:19.260
So, Dr. C in chat says,

01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:21.260
I've heard all the bullshit Autism Speaks has been up to.

01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:23.260
I used to follow Hot Wheels on Facebook.

01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:25.260
Hey, been a fan of the diecast car since I was little.

01:59:25.260 --> 01:59:28.260
But then I found out they were teaming up with Autism Speaks on something,

01:59:28.260 --> 01:59:29.260
so I was done.

01:59:29.260 --> 01:59:33.260
So, you know, and kind of something I expressed,

01:59:33.260 --> 01:59:35.260
we were texting about this yesterday or the day before,

01:59:35.260 --> 01:59:37.260
I was kind of expressing shock.

01:59:37.260 --> 01:59:40.260
I was like, well, I mean, I get that this is bothersome,

01:59:40.260 --> 01:59:44.260
but how does this fucking charity stay afloat?

01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:46.260
Like, that's my bigger question.

01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:50.260
Like, how is this charity even still in existence?

01:59:50.260 --> 01:59:53.260
So, I guess education is a big part of that.

01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:55.260
Wasn't I saying it has a lot to do with their PR?

01:59:55.260 --> 01:59:56.260
Probably.

01:59:56.260 --> 01:59:57.260
You know, the fact that,

01:59:57.260 --> 02:00:02.260
and I even have an autistic friend who says that she got a lot of assistance from them.

02:00:03.260 --> 02:00:08.260
But, you know, and doesn't see where all the bad press is coming from,

02:00:08.260 --> 02:00:11.260
but I'm like, how about the rest of us who have been a complete,

02:00:11.260 --> 02:00:14.260
or, you know, there's people in other threads I've seen on there,

02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:18.260
who when they got their diagnosis as an adult reached out for assistance

02:00:18.260 --> 02:00:22.260
and were basically just completely ignored or told to find somebody else.

02:00:22.260 --> 02:00:24.260
Like, in those words.

02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:30.260
You know, it's, and the thing I like about the Autism Self Advocacy Network

02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:34.260
is that their motto is nothing for us without us.

02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:39.260
And there's not many things that I will get super heated about.

02:00:39.260 --> 02:00:41.260
There are some things.

02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:44.260
This one I feel very passionately about because…

02:00:44.260 --> 02:00:45.260
Well, sure.

02:00:45.260 --> 02:00:48.260
And that's why I really brought up the scenario about the whole, like,

02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:51.260
conversion therapy thing, like, trying to make an analogy.

02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:55.260
Because if it was that, like, not that I'm not pissed off on your behalf,

02:00:55.260 --> 02:00:59.260
but, like, I would be really pissed off if it was, like, the scenario I described.

02:00:59.260 --> 02:01:02.260
Now that I think about it, actually it is fairly apt because, I mean,

02:01:02.260 --> 02:01:05.260
they are doing shock therapy to autistic kids out there.

02:01:05.260 --> 02:01:07.260
That's what they're thinking, yeah.

02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:11.260
And even though he's one of my favorite actors, Jim Beaver,

02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:18.260
who was on Supernatural, I reached out to him to ask about his daughter's treatment

02:01:18.260 --> 02:01:21.260
because his daughter was, I think, non-verbal for a while.

02:01:21.260 --> 02:01:23.260
And he's like, she's not autistic anymore.

02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:26.260
I'm like, what the fuck do you mean she's not autistic anymore?

02:01:26.260 --> 02:01:28.260
You never are not autistic.

02:01:28.260 --> 02:01:30.260
It just means she's learned behavioral therapies.

02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:34.260
You cannot cure autism.

02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:36.260
It's not a disease.

02:01:36.260 --> 02:01:38.260
And vaccines don't cause it.

02:01:38.260 --> 02:01:40.260
Autism Speaks used to be on the bandwagon with that too.

02:01:40.260 --> 02:01:41.260
I know, I know.

02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:42.260
All right, anyway.

02:01:42.260 --> 02:01:44.260
I'm sure we could do a whole…

02:01:44.260 --> 02:01:46.260
We have a show full of three-hour shows tonight,

02:01:46.260 --> 02:01:48.260
but I do want to move on for now.

02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:51.260
But, hey, if nothing else, the people listening tonight

02:01:51.260 --> 02:01:53.260
maybe learned something tonight, so.

02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:56.260
Won't make the same booboo as Niantic.

02:01:56.260 --> 02:01:59.260
So, anyhow, let's move on with some more news stories.

02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:02.260
Just a couple more, actually, and then we're going to get to the Skype line

02:02:02.260 --> 02:02:04.260
at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:02:04.260 --> 02:02:06.260
And this may actually be the…

02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:08.260
No, I think we'll still have Skype next week

02:02:08.260 --> 02:02:11.260
because I'll probably just use the iPad to work around it.

02:02:11.260 --> 02:02:14.260
But Skype's sadly a daze with our show.

02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:15.260
Maybe a little bit numbered.

02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:16.260
We'll see.

02:02:16.260 --> 02:02:17.260
Anyway, for now, for now, for now.

02:02:17.260 --> 02:02:21.260
I'm not saying that we won't have a way to take calls one way or another.

02:02:21.260 --> 02:02:23.260
If I have to bring back the 800 number and do that whole thing,

02:02:23.260 --> 02:02:26.260
then we'll do it that way, but we'll work on that.

02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:28.260
Anyway, for now, Loki.

02:02:28.260 --> 02:02:31.260
So, there's this massive Fallout mod that's been released

02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:35.260
called Fallout New Californians, a mod for Fallout New Vegas.

02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:39.260
And it's finished, and you can play it now, so go check it out.

02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:44.260
Apparently it's been a project that's been in the works for about six years now.

02:02:44.260 --> 02:02:48.260
They have a ton of content in this.

02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:53.260
There's 42 missions in the game, 13 different endings.

02:02:53.260 --> 02:02:56.260
Depending on your play style, it'll take about six to eight hours

02:02:56.260 --> 02:02:59.260
to 15 to 30 hours if you're a completionist.

02:02:59.260 --> 02:03:04.260
The play's almost 17,000 lines of dialogue spoken by…

02:03:04.260 --> 02:03:10.260
They said about 15,000 of those, which are spoken by 60 volunteer voice actors.

02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:13.260
Yeah, so it's awesome.

02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:17.260
So if you're interested in checking it out, go to moddb.com slash mods slash

02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:23.260
Fallout Project Brazil, and you'll find Fallout New California.

02:03:23.260 --> 02:03:25.260
I'm thinking about checking this out.

02:03:25.260 --> 02:03:26.260
Yeah, it sounds like fun.

02:03:26.260 --> 02:03:30.260
Because I'm not picking up Fallout 76, so maybe.

02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:33.260
A different way to experience Fallout in the next few days, I suppose.

02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:34.260
Yeah.

02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:39.260
Alright, I got one more Twitter fuckup for you guys to close out the news tonight,

02:03:39.260 --> 02:03:41.260
and I'm sure you guys have heard of this one.

02:03:41.260 --> 02:03:45.260
This one's shitty. There's really no way around this one.

02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:50.260
It comes from goodoldgames.com, or GOGcom as they're known on Twitter.

02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:53.260
They wrote a tweet earlier this week that said,

02:03:53.260 --> 02:03:57.260
classic PC games hashtag won't be erased on our watch.

02:03:57.260 --> 02:04:00.260
Yeah, how's that for some use of hashtags?

02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:03.260
And they deleted that tweet, and the reason why that was a shitty tweet

02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:09.260
is because hashtag won't be erased is a Twitter hashtag that has been used a lot

02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:13.260
by the trans community in response to a lot of the news

02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:18.260
that has come out of our government about how basically the president

02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:23.260
and some advice counselor, I don't know all the legal names of things,

02:04:23.260 --> 02:04:28.260
but in a nutshell, the president and the people around him want to

02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:34.260
basically legal define his two genders that are defined by, you know,

02:04:34.260 --> 02:04:37.260
what's in your pants, and it's gross.

02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:44.260
And I want any trans folks out there listening to know that I support you.

02:04:44.260 --> 02:04:47.260
You're valid. This is bullshit.

02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:50.260
And that's why I think it pissed a lot of people off

02:04:50.260 --> 02:04:54.260
when GOGcom decided to make a joke out of it, you know?

02:04:54.260 --> 02:04:58.260
I mean, the second sentence there, yeah, how's that for some use of hashtags?

02:04:58.260 --> 02:05:04.260
Fuck off. Like, how dare you? Go fucking sell games.

02:05:04.260 --> 02:05:09.260
Like, do you think you're fucking edgy like Wendy's or Arby's or something?

02:05:09.260 --> 02:05:12.260
That's not edgy. That is not, like, this is very-

02:05:12.260 --> 02:05:14.260
That's cunty.

02:05:14.260 --> 02:05:18.260
One way. But, I mean, this is a serious issue that, you know,

02:05:18.260 --> 02:05:21.260
this is not the time. Like, if you want to look at, like,

02:05:21.260 --> 02:05:24.260
how to, like, be ruffle feathers or whatever on Twitter,

02:05:24.260 --> 02:05:28.260
go look up Wendy's account or something. Wendy's would not do something stupid like that.

02:05:28.260 --> 02:05:30.260
Well, at least I hope they wouldn't. You know what I mean?

02:05:30.260 --> 02:05:33.260
So, it was just, oh, it was really gross.

02:05:33.260 --> 02:05:39.260
And what makes it worse, like, it would be one thing if this is the first time this has happened.

02:05:39.260 --> 02:05:41.260
But it's not the first time this has happened.

02:05:41.260 --> 02:05:46.260
So, the social media team at Good Old Games and CD Projekt Red,

02:05:46.260 --> 02:05:51.260
which this all kind of runs up to, is they run the Good Old Games.

02:05:51.260 --> 02:05:53.260
And, of course, they're making the Cyberpunk 2077,

02:05:53.260 --> 02:05:56.260
which was where one of the other bad tweets came from, was that account.

02:05:56.260 --> 02:06:02.260
The social management at this team, like, needs, like, a good, hard, scolding, probably firing,

02:06:02.260 --> 02:06:07.260
but, you know, some serious education on how to conduct themselves online

02:06:07.260 --> 02:06:09.260
and what is and what isn't appropriate.

02:06:09.260 --> 02:06:12.260
And there's a lot of people calling for some serious change over there.

02:06:12.260 --> 02:06:18.260
Or they're going to pay for it in other ways, such as the fact that, as a result of this,

02:06:18.260 --> 02:06:24.260
the makers of Journey Quest, Zombie Orpheus, cancelled their contract with Good Old Games.

02:06:24.260 --> 02:06:30.260
They, as soon as, you know, this happened again, they basically said, the CEO Ben Dobbins said,

02:06:30.260 --> 02:06:34.260
quote, the harm that hate speech does to people who are under immense threat from governments,

02:06:34.260 --> 02:06:37.260
private individuals and corporations is incalculable.

02:06:37.260 --> 02:06:41.260
It's downright sociopathic to demean our friends and allies in this way.

02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:44.260
There's absolutely nothing funny about any of it.

02:06:44.260 --> 02:06:48.260
And that's the same reason why I won't buy any of the Witcher games or that new Cyberpunk game coming out.

02:06:48.260 --> 02:06:51.260
That company has done the same shit, too.

02:06:51.260 --> 02:06:58.260
Yeah, well, I mean, I would be a little more comfortable buying that stuff because here's the thing.

02:06:58.260 --> 02:07:03.260
Like, the social media team is bonkers crazy with this stuff.

02:07:03.260 --> 02:07:07.260
I don't want that to invalidate necessarily the hard work of all these people that are making the game,

02:07:07.260 --> 02:07:09.260
the hundreds of other people.

02:07:09.260 --> 02:07:14.260
But that social media stuff needs to change and it needs to be communicated to us how it's going to change.

02:07:14.260 --> 02:07:16.260
And if that doesn't happen, then we have no other choice.

02:07:16.260 --> 02:07:23.260
But I'm not going to give my money to a company that thinks it's OK to do that.

02:07:23.260 --> 02:07:24.260
And honestly, I...

02:07:24.260 --> 02:07:29.260
Right, and they need to come out in very plain language and not these runaround tweets.

02:07:29.260 --> 02:07:34.260
They come out in very plain language and say how it's going to be different, in my opinion.

02:07:34.260 --> 02:07:39.260
I'm not going to support a company that allows that, even for the sake of the employees, I'm sorry.

02:07:39.260 --> 02:07:44.260
Because they're just going to, if we keep doing that, they're going to keep doing that shit.

02:07:44.260 --> 02:07:46.260
You have to vote with your money.

02:07:46.260 --> 02:07:47.260
Fair enough.

02:07:47.260 --> 02:07:50.260
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:07:50.260 --> 02:07:53.260
SSJ100Matt says, GOG needs to delete their account.

02:07:53.260 --> 02:07:55.260
That would be a good resolution as well.

02:07:55.260 --> 02:07:58.260
Dungeonbuster in chat says, I was pretty shocked when I read this story.

02:07:58.260 --> 02:08:02.260
And dartitsuya says, I remember that one about Cyber 2077 months ago.

02:08:02.260 --> 02:08:04.260
It was probably the same asshole.

02:08:04.260 --> 02:08:06.260
Yeah, so...

02:08:06.260 --> 02:08:10.260
If you're going to do social media, like, remember you are representing a whole company.

02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:15.260
And stop being edgy for clicks.

02:08:15.260 --> 02:08:18.260
And if, like, don't...

02:08:18.260 --> 02:08:23.260
Like, if you're going to be edgy, do it the way Wendy's does it by talking shit about McDonald's.

02:08:23.260 --> 02:08:24.260
That's funny.

02:08:24.260 --> 02:08:26.260
This? Not funny.

02:08:26.260 --> 02:08:28.260
So, anyway.

02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:31.260
What's your favorite Wendy's tweet?

02:08:31.260 --> 02:08:33.260
I don't know.

02:08:34.260 --> 02:08:40.260
Probably, you know, the most famous tweet of all time or the most retweeted was the guy that asked for the chicken nuggets from Wendy's.

02:08:40.260 --> 02:08:43.260
I guess that was as annoying as that whole thing, I think, ended up becoming.

02:08:43.260 --> 02:08:46.260
I think that was a pretty epic thing on Wendy's behalf. I don't know.

02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:49.260
What happened with that? Did he get his chicken nuggets?

02:08:49.260 --> 02:08:51.260
I think he did get his chicken nuggets, yeah.

02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:58.260
But he actually tweeted Wendy's and was like, how many for free McNuggets, or not McNuggets, but whatever, just free nuggets for life or whatever.

02:08:58.260 --> 02:09:01.260
And Wendy's said it was, I don't know, 18 million.

02:09:01.260 --> 02:09:02.260
And he got, like, really close.

02:09:02.260 --> 02:09:04.260
And Wendy's, I think, gave him the free nuggets anyway.

02:09:04.260 --> 02:09:09.260
And I'm sure it was all done on the Ellen show, because that's how these things always resolve themselves.

02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:13.260
Anyway.

02:09:13.260 --> 02:09:16.260
We are going to open up the Skype line right now.

02:09:16.260 --> 02:09:18.260
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:09:18.260 --> 02:09:24.260
If you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight, or perhaps something else, while we wait to see if any calls come in.

02:09:24.260 --> 02:09:26.260
I don't know if we have any last minute stories.

02:09:26.260 --> 02:09:41.260
There was some pictures of some prototypes that apparently Microsoft's been working on as far as controllers that would attach to some sort of phone or tablet device to go along with this whole streaming service that they were going to be doing, the Project X cloud.

02:09:41.260 --> 02:09:46.260
So they have some prototypes that show, like, some controller things that look neat.

02:09:46.260 --> 02:09:50.260
I mean, looks like they might be comfy.

02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:54.260
It kind of reminds me a little bit of, like, the Switch dock a little bit.

02:09:54.260 --> 02:10:00.260
Because they have, you know, basically this piece that goes in the middle that you put the two halves into to charge it.

02:10:00.260 --> 02:10:03.260
And they would just clip on the side of your phone or whatever.

02:10:05.260 --> 02:10:07.260
I could see that, I guess.

02:10:07.260 --> 02:10:10.260
So curious where Microsoft's going to go for their next console.

02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:14.260
I wonder if they're really going to try to do something a little more radical with their next console.

02:10:14.260 --> 02:10:18.260
Like, you know, how, like, Nintendo did the whole, you know, take it anywhere you go type of thing.

02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:22.260
Like, what is Microsoft going to try to do something that really sells that ecosystem with PC?

02:10:22.260 --> 02:10:25.260
Or, like, what are they going to do for their next consoles?

02:10:25.260 --> 02:10:30.260
Because I think we all expect that PlayStation 5 is just going to be, like, more PlayStation 4, but, like, more parts.

02:10:30.260 --> 02:10:32.260
You know, that whole type of thing.

02:10:32.260 --> 02:10:35.260
You know, maybe VR integrated a little more or something.

02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:41.260
But, you know, it's interesting to guess where Microsoft's going to go next.

02:10:41.260 --> 02:10:43.260
I'm just curious where everything's going to go.

02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:46.260
Because, I don't know.

02:10:46.260 --> 02:10:50.260
You know, we'll probably have it all figured out by the time we get to episode 1,000.

02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:53.260
Probably will.

02:10:53.260 --> 02:11:00.260
Who would have thought that the MECO is going to take over the market and become the dominating force of everything?

02:11:00.260 --> 02:11:02.260
Who would have thought?

02:11:02.260 --> 02:11:04.260
Who would have thought?

02:11:04.260 --> 02:11:07.260
Do you think this show's going to get to 1,000 episodes?

02:11:07.260 --> 02:11:08.260
Probably.

02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:10.260
How many years is it going to take to do 200?

02:11:10.260 --> 02:11:11.260
That's about five more years of episodes.

02:11:11.260 --> 02:11:13.260
So we've got five more years left in us?

02:11:13.260 --> 02:11:14.260
Yeah.

02:11:14.260 --> 02:11:16.260
What the hell?

02:11:16.260 --> 02:11:20.260
We have to make sure all the kids are old enough to take over the show properly once we're done.

02:11:20.260 --> 02:11:26.260
We have to make sure, like, Julian, whoever else's kids wants to come in, take over the show.

02:11:26.260 --> 02:11:29.260
That they're, like, 18 and they're good to take it over.

02:11:29.260 --> 02:11:31.260
So.

02:11:31.260 --> 02:11:34.260
Fuck if I won't let those kids take over the show.

02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:39.260
Over my dead body!

02:11:39.260 --> 02:11:40.260
Let's see.

02:11:40.260 --> 02:11:45.260
Oh, Mega Man X400 says, I tried calling on Skype and it doesn't seem like it's working.

02:11:45.260 --> 02:11:46.260
Uh oh, that's not good.

02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:48.260
We should let Midna and Smoosh do the show.

02:11:48.260 --> 02:11:50.260
Let me.

02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:52.260
I'm going to restart Skype.

02:11:52.260 --> 02:11:54.260
Actually, one thing I always do is I try to call for my phone.

02:11:54.260 --> 02:11:56.260
I'm going to try calling for my phone and see if that works.

02:11:56.260 --> 02:11:59.260
And then if it doesn't, I'll give it a good old trusty reboot.

02:11:59.260 --> 02:12:01.260
This is going to be meh.

02:12:01.260 --> 02:12:02.260
Meh.

02:12:02.260 --> 02:12:07.260
So, in Google Fit news, apparently it's not compatible with the Fitbit.

02:12:07.260 --> 02:12:09.260
So they can fuck right off because.

02:12:09.260 --> 02:12:10.260
Really?

02:12:10.260 --> 02:12:11.260
How the fuck am I going to track?

02:12:11.260 --> 02:12:14.260
You have two apps open to track mileage?

02:12:14.260 --> 02:12:15.260
Fuck that shit.

02:12:15.260 --> 02:12:17.260
Seriously.

02:12:17.260 --> 02:12:20.260
Okay, yeah, I just called the Skype line and it worked fine.

02:12:20.260 --> 02:12:25.260
Just make sure you're using Orange Launch Radio, all one word, on Skype.

02:12:25.260 --> 02:12:27.260
And it should work.

02:12:27.260 --> 02:12:29.260
But we'll see.

02:12:29.260 --> 02:12:32.260
But I did call a test just now and it worked.

02:12:32.260 --> 02:12:34.260
Any other stories you want to get to, Loki?

02:12:35.260 --> 02:12:43.260
There's speculation that the PlayStation 5 will have a built-in VR functionality to let players track their movement without an external device.

02:12:43.260 --> 02:12:44.260
Hmm.

02:12:44.260 --> 02:12:48.260
So, apparently according to some patent information.

02:12:48.260 --> 02:12:49.260
Interesting.

02:12:49.260 --> 02:12:51.260
That's neat, I guess.

02:12:51.260 --> 02:12:57.260
There was an exploit in Grand Theft Auto 5 that allowed hackers to kill people in single player.

02:12:58.260 --> 02:13:01.260
If you're connected to Rockstar Social Club.

02:13:01.260 --> 02:13:10.260
Because apparently they were hacking using the admin tools that apparently they had super user powers that could do all sorts of shenanigans.

02:13:10.260 --> 02:13:12.260
And that did get patched out, thankfully.

02:13:12.260 --> 02:13:14.260
But it was a thing.

02:13:14.260 --> 02:13:18.260
Yeah, multiplayer mode is no fun to be fucking around with on that stuff.

02:13:18.260 --> 02:13:20.260
But this was single player though, this was not multiplayer mode.

02:13:20.260 --> 02:13:21.260
Oh, I thought it was multiplayer mode.

02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:23.260
This was in single player that people were getting hacked.

02:13:23.260 --> 02:13:24.260
Yikes.

02:13:24.260 --> 02:13:25.260
If they were, you know, online.

02:13:25.260 --> 02:13:26.260
Oh dear.

02:13:26.260 --> 02:13:29.260
So, yeah, not fun there either.

02:13:29.260 --> 02:13:31.260
Glad they closed that out.

02:13:31.260 --> 02:13:34.260
Yooka-Laylee's getting a 64-bit mode.

02:13:34.260 --> 02:13:39.260
It's gonna look like Nintendo 64 or Banjo-Kazooie since, I mean, that is what it's kind of...

02:13:39.260 --> 02:13:41.260
So it's getting a retro filter.

02:13:41.260 --> 02:13:42.260
Inspired by, yeah.

02:13:42.260 --> 02:13:47.260
Retro filter with all of the blurry, low-resolution assets.

02:13:47.260 --> 02:13:48.260
Fantastic.

02:13:48.260 --> 02:13:51.260
So that's kind of neat, I guess.

02:13:52.260 --> 02:13:55.260
Another completely random thought.

02:13:55.260 --> 02:13:57.260
I was looking at release dates coming out.

02:13:57.260 --> 02:14:03.260
And did you know that the same day Smash Brothers comes out on the Switch, Katamari comes out as well.

02:14:03.260 --> 02:14:05.260
Oh no, I didn't realize they shared the same day.

02:14:05.260 --> 02:14:07.260
And it's on PC, so I'm totally picking that bump on PC.

02:14:07.260 --> 02:14:09.260
The Katamari game's on PC.

02:14:09.260 --> 02:14:10.260
It says it's on PC.

02:14:10.260 --> 02:14:11.260
Oh, that's great.

02:14:11.260 --> 02:14:12.260
I'm excited for that.

02:14:12.260 --> 02:14:14.260
Because I'm looking for mods.

02:14:14.260 --> 02:14:15.260
Fuck yeah, new levels.

02:14:15.260 --> 02:14:16.260
Hell yes.

02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:18.260
Yeah, they're gonna mod the shit out of that.

02:14:19.260 --> 02:14:20.260
Other people will fucking support that shit.

02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:22.260
They'll break that shit apart and make it awesome.

02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:24.260
Oh, that's really exciting about PC.

02:14:24.260 --> 02:14:26.260
We rolling up giant dicks in no time.

02:14:26.260 --> 02:14:30.260
What to do, mods on PC or portability on Switch?

02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:32.260
It's hard to decide.

02:14:32.260 --> 02:14:37.260
You buy the Switch version, then you wait for the sale on PC because Switch games never fucking go on sale.

02:14:37.260 --> 02:14:38.260
Okay.

02:14:38.260 --> 02:14:39.260
You can just do that and you get both.

02:14:39.260 --> 02:14:40.260
Alright.

02:14:40.260 --> 02:14:41.260
That's some critical thinking.

02:14:41.260 --> 02:14:42.260
I like that.

02:14:43.260 --> 02:14:46.260
Dark Sakura, when are we gonna get to see you next here in studio?

02:14:46.260 --> 02:14:47.260
Another fourth Sunday.

02:14:47.260 --> 02:14:48.260
Another fourth Sunday.

02:14:48.260 --> 02:14:49.260
Alright.

02:14:49.260 --> 02:14:50.260
We'll see.

02:14:50.260 --> 02:14:53.260
Well, I think, I don't know if Skype is broken or what.

02:14:53.260 --> 02:14:56.260
Even though I just did a test call, it worked fine.

02:14:56.260 --> 02:14:57.260
Something must be going on.

02:14:57.260 --> 02:15:01.260
So it's nice to see Skype on Windows XP going out with a whimper.

02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:02.260
Oh, and then of course.

02:15:02.260 --> 02:15:03.260
Here on episode 750.

02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:08.260
With us, there was a big ol' 4chan Smash Brothers rumors thing this week.

02:15:08.260 --> 02:15:15.260
You know, allegedly there was artwork, marketing artwork that was leaked,

02:15:15.260 --> 02:15:18.260
showing the full banner with all the characters in there.

02:15:18.260 --> 02:15:21.260
It's crazy the amount of investigation.

02:15:21.260 --> 02:15:25.260
The blurry guesses based on what they saw.

02:15:25.260 --> 02:15:34.260
Shadow, the Hedgehog, Banjo-Kazooie, Isaac, Ken, Mock Rider, Geno, and Chorus Kids.

02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:35.260
We'll see.

02:15:37.260 --> 02:15:38.260
I mean, coming from 4chan.

02:15:38.260 --> 02:15:39.260
Come on.

02:15:39.260 --> 02:15:40.260
Come on.

02:15:41.260 --> 02:15:42.260
We're only a few months away.

02:15:43.260 --> 02:15:44.260
Alright.

02:15:44.260 --> 02:15:45.260
We'll just wait and see.

02:15:46.260 --> 02:15:47.260
I know, that's where my head is at.

02:15:47.260 --> 02:15:52.260
Is it like, you know, oh they've got these, you know, leaks and things and all this analysis.

02:15:52.260 --> 02:15:54.260
There's been so many fake leaks anyways.

02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:59.260
Remember the whole Rayman leaked in with the last version of Smash that Rayman was gonna be in the game?

02:15:59.260 --> 02:16:05.260
Is it really going to change your perception on if you're gonna buy the game or not?

02:16:05.260 --> 02:16:09.260
Like, are you really gonna change your mind based on these last character leaks?

02:16:09.260 --> 02:16:10.260
No.

02:16:10.260 --> 02:16:12.260
Like, you know, all the people whooping and hollering.

02:16:12.260 --> 02:16:15.260
If Geno isn't in the game, I'm not gonna buy it.

02:16:15.260 --> 02:16:16.260
It's like, yeah right.

02:16:16.260 --> 02:16:17.260
Yeah right.

02:16:18.260 --> 02:16:20.260
Hey, we got a call coming in.

02:16:20.260 --> 02:16:24.260
I'm sure this person is helping us test the line or something, but let's see.

02:16:24.260 --> 02:16:26.260
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:16:26.260 --> 02:16:27.260
Who's this?

02:16:27.260 --> 02:16:28.260
I think it works.

02:16:28.260 --> 02:16:29.260
It does work.

02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:30.260
I knew it worked.

02:16:30.260 --> 02:16:31.260
I don't know what's going on.

02:16:31.260 --> 02:16:32.260
Hey Bobby, how you doing?

02:16:32.260 --> 02:16:33.260
I'm doing well.

02:16:33.260 --> 02:16:34.260
How are you?

02:16:34.260 --> 02:16:35.260
Good.

02:16:35.260 --> 02:16:37.260
It's the host of the one and only Bobby Blackwell Show here on our show.

02:16:37.260 --> 02:16:38.260
That's right.

02:16:38.260 --> 02:16:39.260
That's right.

02:16:39.260 --> 02:16:42.260
We'll let us in at the end of your show, but it's nice to have you here, especially

02:16:42.260 --> 02:16:44.260
on a big episode number like this.

02:16:44.260 --> 02:16:45.260
Yes.

02:16:45.260 --> 02:16:46.260
Yes.

02:16:46.260 --> 02:16:47.260
750.

02:16:47.260 --> 02:16:48.260
This was a momentous episode.

02:16:48.260 --> 02:16:49.260
It was.

02:16:49.260 --> 02:16:50.260
Just because.

02:16:50.260 --> 02:16:51.260
It was.

02:16:51.260 --> 02:16:52.260
They're all momentous episodes.

02:16:52.260 --> 02:16:53.260
Very special.

02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:54.260
We did a lot of special things.

02:16:54.260 --> 02:16:55.260
Yes.

02:16:55.260 --> 02:16:56.260
What's on your mind tonight?

02:16:56.260 --> 02:16:57.260
Nothing.

02:16:57.260 --> 02:17:00.260
I'm actually just trying to get stuff to work on Windows 10.

02:17:00.260 --> 02:17:04.260
Because trying to get a microphone to work with no delay, that's the thing that kills

02:17:04.260 --> 02:17:05.260
me.

02:17:05.260 --> 02:17:06.260
Oh yeah.

02:17:06.260 --> 02:17:08.260
That's the thing that's always made me nervous about the Windows 10 upgrade is the whole

02:17:08.260 --> 02:17:15.260
delay and all that stuff, but there's a whole, but then money and that you're locked into

02:17:15.260 --> 02:17:18.260
one system, but garage band is better.

02:17:18.260 --> 02:17:20.260
I don't know for what we do with live.

02:17:20.260 --> 02:17:21.260
I don't think it is.

02:17:21.260 --> 02:17:22.260
If this were taped.

02:17:22.260 --> 02:17:23.260
Absolutely.

02:17:23.260 --> 02:17:25.260
It would work great for life.

02:17:25.260 --> 02:17:26.260
Yeah.

02:17:26.260 --> 02:17:27.260
Yeah.

02:17:27.260 --> 02:17:29.260
Especially with the, with the, with the Twitch and all that other stuff.

02:17:29.260 --> 02:17:30.260
I don't know.

02:17:30.260 --> 02:17:31.260
It's gonna be the right option.

02:17:31.260 --> 02:17:33.260
I know how to make it all work.

02:17:33.260 --> 02:17:34.260
Come up with a proposal.

02:17:34.260 --> 02:17:35.260
We'll look into it.

02:17:35.260 --> 02:17:36.260
All right.

02:17:36.260 --> 02:17:39.260
Kajudo in chat says, my mic never delayed on Windows 10.

02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:41.260
I, I think it's because this is the onboard one.

02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:44.260
Cause like I'm seeing like other things that are like, well, if you use a different sound

02:17:44.260 --> 02:17:49.260
card, so I may like when I build a new machine, actually put like a special, a different sound

02:17:49.260 --> 02:17:51.260
card in there and that may help.

02:17:51.260 --> 02:17:53.260
Cause that's what I've got in my Windows 7 machine.

02:17:53.260 --> 02:17:54.260
Yeah.

02:17:54.260 --> 02:18:00.260
So, so, and I don't think my work would let me use my Mac laptop for this type of stuff

02:18:00.260 --> 02:18:02.260
because that's the only Mac I have.

02:18:02.260 --> 02:18:03.260
Yeah.

02:18:03.260 --> 02:18:04.260
Yeah.

02:18:04.260 --> 02:18:09.260
Um, and I was going to say, um, Oh, uh, with the, the, with all the windows stuff I was

02:18:09.260 --> 02:18:13.260
looking into, I was going to look at getting a USB sound blaster.

02:18:13.260 --> 02:18:18.260
Cause my last idea was getting a laptop, you know, because they make laptops that are beefier

02:18:18.260 --> 02:18:20.260
than what we run OLR on now.

02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:25.260
So get a laptop, use an, uh, USB, uh, sound blaster card with it.

02:18:25.260 --> 02:18:30.260
Get kind of redo the mixing board to go all digital with it and a little more cause we

02:18:30.260 --> 02:18:31.260
can probably scale it down.

02:18:31.260 --> 02:18:35.260
We have like a full on like music, like mixing board.

02:18:35.260 --> 02:18:37.260
It probably doesn't need to be as good as what we have.

02:18:37.260 --> 02:18:39.260
Kind of scale that back and make it digital.

02:18:39.260 --> 02:18:42.260
And I think it, I think it'll be great for, um, OLR.

02:18:42.260 --> 02:18:43.260
Yeah.

02:18:43.260 --> 02:18:45.260
I'm looking at all this stuff too.

02:18:45.260 --> 02:18:46.260
Yeah.

02:18:46.260 --> 02:18:50.260
So it's going to be, uh, going to be some big changes ahead, but, uh, hopefully we'll

02:18:50.260 --> 02:18:52.260
be able to get that settled in the next month or so.

02:18:52.260 --> 02:18:55.260
Probably it's something I'm going to be looking to do during like the Thanksgiving break.

02:18:55.260 --> 02:18:56.260
So we'll see.

02:18:56.260 --> 02:18:57.260
Yeah.

02:18:57.260 --> 02:18:59.260
And everybody's like, my mic didn't delay in windows 10.

02:18:59.260 --> 02:19:00.260
What's happening?

02:19:00.260 --> 02:19:05.260
What happens is like when I'm listening to it with headphones, cause I like to hear my

02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:11.260
own levels, uh, in windows seven, it's, I just hear myself and it's not, it doesn't

02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:12.260
mess me up or anything.

02:19:12.260 --> 02:19:17.260
I'm like, I'm just a little louder in my ears, which is great in windows 10 and windows eight

02:19:17.260 --> 02:19:18.260
actually.

02:19:18.260 --> 02:19:22.260
Cause my laptop is windows eight still cause I never upgraded it to 10 cause it couldn't.

02:19:22.260 --> 02:19:24.260
I didn't have hardware drivers for it.

02:19:24.260 --> 02:19:28.260
It would be just, it's like not even a full second off.

02:19:28.260 --> 02:19:30.260
It's like maybe like a fourth of a second.

02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:32.260
It's like 200 milliseconds maybe.

02:19:32.260 --> 02:19:36.260
That's when it would come back and it's just enough of an echo to mess with you.

02:19:36.260 --> 02:19:37.260
Yeah.

02:19:37.260 --> 02:19:38.260
Yeah.

02:19:38.260 --> 02:19:40.260
And we have, I mean like here in studio, we don't use headphones.

02:19:40.260 --> 02:19:44.260
We actually have like speakers, but technically our own voices go out through the speakers.

02:19:44.260 --> 02:19:46.260
Thankfully there's no lag.

02:19:46.260 --> 02:19:49.260
So it just kind of sounds like our voices are amplified here in the room a little bit,

02:19:49.260 --> 02:19:53.260
but it's how we hear you guys on Skype and the various onboard noises and those very

02:19:53.260 --> 02:19:57.260
limited places where we do like YouTube's or let's say the intro, I guess the intro

02:19:57.260 --> 02:20:00.260
is something that's every week, you know, or the little music beds that happen over

02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:01.260
classic of the week.

02:20:01.260 --> 02:20:04.260
We can hear all that in studio and that kind of helps us a lot.

02:20:04.260 --> 02:20:05.260
Yeah.

02:20:05.260 --> 02:20:07.260
And Kajudo says, you know, use virtual audio cables.

02:20:07.260 --> 02:20:08.260
You can set the delay.

02:20:08.260 --> 02:20:12.260
The problem is you can't delay it back in time.

02:20:12.260 --> 02:20:16.260
You can delay it forward in time, but not necessarily back in time.

02:20:16.260 --> 02:20:21.260
So if virtual audio cables doesn't get it until a hundred milliseconds after it's

02:20:21.260 --> 02:20:25.260
come out of your mouth, there's nothing it can do to make it go back a hundred milliseconds.

02:20:25.260 --> 02:20:26.260
Right.

02:20:26.260 --> 02:20:29.260
Unless you're the doctor.

02:20:29.260 --> 02:20:31.260
Which may be the only way.

02:20:31.260 --> 02:20:32.260
Yeah.

02:20:32.260 --> 02:20:37.260
So it's a fun, but like music producers have this issue all the time.

02:20:37.260 --> 02:20:41.260
And so they've been talking about this because it's very hard to do karaoke like this.

02:20:41.260 --> 02:20:42.260
Yes.

02:20:42.260 --> 02:20:43.260
For instance.

02:20:43.260 --> 02:20:47.260
And, you know, anybody that tries to like record music has these kind of issues.

02:20:47.260 --> 02:20:51.260
And I know Mac is better on this stuff, but I can't afford a Mac.

02:20:51.260 --> 02:20:55.260
So and I've got a Mac here and I'm sure it would work great, but my work would really

02:20:55.260 --> 02:20:57.260
get upset at me for using my Mac.

02:20:57.260 --> 02:20:59.260
You have to separate work and play.

02:20:59.260 --> 02:21:02.260
I know people though who do all their stuff off Mac minis.

02:21:02.260 --> 02:21:06.260
I'm running Logic Pro X.

02:21:06.260 --> 02:21:10.260
So just, and I already own a copy, so.

02:21:10.260 --> 02:21:11.260
What was it?

02:21:11.260 --> 02:21:14.260
I was looking in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:21:14.260 --> 02:21:18.260
Tigerclaw does point out that the virtual audio cable is good for audio, but not for video.

02:21:18.260 --> 02:21:22.260
So, and that's obviously an important direction for the future of what we're doing as well.

02:21:23.260 --> 02:21:26.260
So it's got to be able to do both, which is what we're looking into.

02:21:26.260 --> 02:21:27.260
So.

02:21:27.260 --> 02:21:30.260
I was trying to set something up to stream tonight from that machine.

02:21:30.260 --> 02:21:34.260
And I'm not sure if it's done yet or not, but I finally like, I'm like, okay, I don't

02:21:34.260 --> 02:21:38.260
monitor myself when I'm streaming video, so it'll be fine.

02:21:38.260 --> 02:21:42.260
But I hadn't actually hooked up one of my good mics to this machine yet.

02:21:42.260 --> 02:21:43.260
So I was trying to play around with that.

02:21:43.260 --> 02:21:45.260
I'm like, can I get the delay done?

02:21:45.260 --> 02:21:47.260
Because this is a fast enough computer.

02:21:47.260 --> 02:21:50.260
Why don't you tell us a little bit about the stream after the show tonight, even though

02:21:50.260 --> 02:21:53.260
I know it's a podcast and they'll miss it.

02:21:53.260 --> 02:21:55.260
Please pimp your stream.

02:21:55.260 --> 02:21:59.260
So I was considering if I can get everything set up, and I don't have, because I haven't

02:21:59.260 --> 02:22:03.260
hooked up this camera to it yet, and I finally got that working.

02:22:03.260 --> 02:22:08.260
Yeah, Windows 10 thankfully turns off all the privacy on your microphone and your camera,

02:22:08.260 --> 02:22:10.260
so other apps can't access it.

02:22:10.260 --> 02:22:12.260
It's off by default, or at least it was for me.

02:22:12.260 --> 02:22:16.260
So I'm like, why can't I see my webcam in OBS?

02:22:16.260 --> 02:22:17.260
And that's why.

02:22:17.260 --> 02:22:19.260
So, pro tip if you can't get it working.

02:22:19.260 --> 02:22:24.260
But I just got Forza Horizon 4 on my PC up here.

02:22:24.260 --> 02:22:30.260
So I've been playing it in 4K on the Xbox One, but I've got it on the PC, so I think

02:22:30.260 --> 02:22:35.260
I may be able to stream it tonight, and if anybody wants to Horizon Convoy or something,

02:22:35.260 --> 02:22:40.260
we can meet up in Discord or something and try to do some multiplayer.

02:22:40.260 --> 02:22:42.260
I tried to do some multiplayer.

02:22:42.260 --> 02:22:48.260
I jumped into Brad from PodCulture's game, and he immediately was like, no, I don't play

02:22:48.260 --> 02:22:49.260
online with other people.

02:22:49.260 --> 02:22:52.260
And so I was like, okay.

02:22:52.260 --> 02:22:55.260
Well, you can play however you want to play, that's right.

02:22:55.260 --> 02:22:56.260
Yep.

02:22:56.260 --> 02:22:59.260
He's like, I didn't realize I was online, and he just went offline.

02:22:59.260 --> 02:23:00.260
Yep.

02:23:00.260 --> 02:23:03.260
What was I going to say with all that stuff too?

02:23:03.260 --> 02:23:09.260
Oh, make sure of course you're following Bobby over on Twitch, and I need to level myself

02:23:09.260 --> 02:23:13.260
up on Forza to get all to that stuff, because I've kind of slacked on Forza 4.

02:23:13.260 --> 02:23:14.260
Yeah, I'm still not going there yet either.

02:23:14.260 --> 02:23:19.260
Yeah, so I'll probably need to play some of that this week to at least unlock that stuff.

02:23:19.260 --> 02:23:21.260
We could probably still do an adventure mode thing or something, I don't know.

02:23:21.260 --> 02:23:22.260
Yeah, maybe.

02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:23.260
I don't know if I'll be around tonight.

02:23:23.260 --> 02:23:25.260
I think I'm doing an errand after the show, so.

02:23:25.260 --> 02:23:29.260
But, I wish you success with your stream, and of course, you know, thanks.

02:23:29.260 --> 02:23:33.260
I know you haven't been there for all 750 episodes, but honestly, you've been there

02:23:33.260 --> 02:23:37.260
for the majority of them, and it's always fantastic having you around, Bobby.

02:23:37.260 --> 02:23:38.260
Thank you.

02:23:38.260 --> 02:23:39.260
You're welcome.

02:23:39.260 --> 02:23:41.260
Best of luck with your show, and we'll talk to you next week.

02:23:41.260 --> 02:23:42.260
All right.

02:23:42.260 --> 02:23:43.260
Just not on Skype and Windows XP.

02:23:43.260 --> 02:23:44.260
No.

02:23:44.260 --> 02:23:45.260
All right.

02:23:45.260 --> 02:23:46.260
Later.

02:23:46.260 --> 02:23:47.260
Yeah.

02:23:47.260 --> 02:23:48.260
All right.

02:23:48.260 --> 02:23:49.260
Let's see.

02:23:49.260 --> 02:23:51.260
I wanted to get to a question in our chat room, because Mega Man X or Delvin was trying

02:23:51.260 --> 02:23:52.260
to get in.

02:23:52.260 --> 02:23:57.260
He couldn't, so he wanted to ask a question kind of like over this, so I'll get to this.

02:23:57.260 --> 02:24:00.260
He says, I guess I will ask my question here to you guys.

02:24:00.260 --> 02:24:07.260
What are your guys' thoughts on the increase in IRL streams on Twitch?

02:24:07.260 --> 02:24:11.260
With TwitchCon this weekend, I was able to watch a few people streaming from there, and

02:24:11.260 --> 02:24:12.260
I felt like I...

02:24:12.260 --> 02:24:13.260
Excuse me.

02:24:13.260 --> 02:24:14.260
I felt like I was there.

02:24:14.260 --> 02:24:15.260
LOL.

02:24:15.260 --> 02:24:18.260
I should have watched more streams from TwitchCon.

02:24:18.260 --> 02:24:22.260
I didn't even think to do that, but again, I was really busy yesterday, so I didn't really

02:24:22.260 --> 02:24:23.260
have time to do it either.

02:24:23.260 --> 02:24:29.260
What do you guys think about watching IRL streams and how IRL is really growing a presence

02:24:29.260 --> 02:24:31.260
on Twitch?

02:24:31.260 --> 02:24:33.260
I don't know quite what you mean by IRL.

02:24:33.260 --> 02:24:34.260
Like real life stuff?

02:24:34.260 --> 02:24:35.260
Yeah.

02:24:35.260 --> 02:24:36.260
Non-gaming.

02:24:36.260 --> 02:24:37.260
Yeah.

02:24:37.260 --> 02:24:38.260
Non-gaming.

02:24:38.260 --> 02:24:39.260
Like people...

02:24:39.260 --> 02:24:40.260
ASMR is really growing.

02:24:41.260 --> 02:24:43.260
So here's the funny thing.

02:24:43.260 --> 02:24:46.260
When I first did my experimental stream, I was like, okay, I'm going to stream myself

02:24:46.260 --> 02:24:49.260
playing DDR, so I did it with my phone using the Twitch app.

02:24:49.260 --> 02:24:50.260
Guess what?

02:24:50.260 --> 02:24:52.260
You can only do IRL crap in there.

02:24:52.260 --> 02:24:55.260
You can't categorize the stream as gaming, so I had to do...

02:24:55.260 --> 02:25:01.260
I think I did like dancing or something, because there was no way for me to say, I'm playing

02:25:01.260 --> 02:25:03.260
a fucking game, you asshole.

02:25:03.260 --> 02:25:05.260
Like put game on here.

02:25:05.260 --> 02:25:09.260
But yeah, you can only do IRL stuff on there, so I don't know.

02:25:09.260 --> 02:25:14.260
I don't watch any of this stuff, but neat, I guess.

02:25:14.260 --> 02:25:16.260
I mean, I could see myself like...

02:25:16.260 --> 02:25:21.260
Eventually when I get set up, it'd be fun to build Legos and shit on stream, and I know

02:25:21.260 --> 02:25:22.260
people do that.

02:25:22.260 --> 02:25:24.260
They'll put together sets and stuff, and that would be fun.

02:25:24.260 --> 02:25:25.260
I'd be down for that.

02:25:25.260 --> 02:25:28.260
I used to draw on livestream.

02:25:28.260 --> 02:25:33.260
I'm not the biggest fan of like a talking head just sitting there reading their chat

02:25:33.260 --> 02:25:34.260
and answering questions.

02:25:34.260 --> 02:25:35.260
I don't like...

02:25:35.260 --> 02:25:38.260
I don't think that content is particularly compelling for me.

02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:41.260
I know there's a lot of feeds that do that, and if you're having success with that, good

02:25:41.260 --> 02:25:42.260
for you.

02:25:42.260 --> 02:25:44.260
It's just not compelling for me.

02:25:44.260 --> 02:25:47.260
But I am loving the game show stuff, right?

02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:51.260
I mentioned a few weeks ago we had Buzzer is really growing over on Twitch.

02:25:51.260 --> 02:25:55.260
That's something I really like to watch, so I like the TV stuff that's growing more and

02:25:55.260 --> 02:25:56.260
more.

02:25:56.260 --> 02:25:58.260
We do have another call coming in, so I do want to get to it.

02:25:58.260 --> 02:25:59.260
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:25:59.260 --> 02:26:00.260
Who's this?

02:26:00.260 --> 02:26:01.260
Hey, what's going on, everyone?

02:26:01.260 --> 02:26:02.260
It is Ranma.

02:26:02.260 --> 02:26:03.260
Hey, Ranma.

02:26:03.260 --> 02:26:04.260
It's good to hear from you.

02:26:04.260 --> 02:26:05.260
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:26:05.260 --> 02:26:06.260
It's good to hear from Oli.

02:26:06.260 --> 02:26:09.260
We have an entire squad back together, you know?

02:26:09.260 --> 02:26:12.260
Like, live concert, one-night-only type, you know?

02:26:12.260 --> 02:26:13.260
I like my laser discs.

02:26:13.260 --> 02:26:14.260
Thank you.

02:26:14.260 --> 02:26:15.260
You're welcome.

02:26:15.260 --> 02:26:16.260
It is.

02:26:16.260 --> 02:26:20.260
It's a bummer we can't do this every week, but I mean, life sucks sometimes.

02:26:20.260 --> 02:26:21.260
It is what it is.

02:26:21.260 --> 02:26:23.260
We work around the challenges life gives us.

02:26:23.260 --> 02:26:24.260
I know.

02:26:24.260 --> 02:26:29.260
I mean, I've been doing my show via Skype for like the last five years, and we do have

02:26:29.260 --> 02:26:32.260
to rotate people out here and there, so you know.

02:26:32.260 --> 02:26:33.260
We just roll with it.

02:26:33.260 --> 02:26:35.260
Yep, you gotta roll with it.

02:26:35.260 --> 02:26:36.260
A couple of things.

02:26:36.260 --> 02:26:37.260
I'll be on my merry little way.

02:26:37.260 --> 02:26:41.260
Number one, I'm a former band geek.

02:26:41.260 --> 02:26:42.260
Nice.

02:26:42.260 --> 02:26:44.260
You're in good company.

02:26:44.260 --> 02:26:49.260
I played the trombone from grade four to seven.

02:26:49.260 --> 02:26:50.260
Okay, good call.

02:26:50.260 --> 02:26:54.260
That's around, I played the clarinet from around six to twelve.

02:26:54.260 --> 02:26:58.260
Good lord, you don't want to know how long I was doing band.

02:26:58.260 --> 02:26:59.260
Your whole life.

02:26:59.260 --> 02:27:03.260
I started on alto sax in sixth grade.

02:27:03.260 --> 02:27:07.260
Moved on to contra alto clarinet in seventh grade.

02:27:07.260 --> 02:27:10.260
Played tenor sax, alto clarinet, contra alto clarinet.

02:27:10.260 --> 02:27:15.260
Went into jazz band in college and played in symphony for three years.

02:27:15.260 --> 02:27:17.260
I was at the University of South Alabama.

02:27:17.260 --> 02:27:18.260
Nerd.

02:27:18.260 --> 02:27:21.260
And then I moved right here, and my saxophone got destroyed in Hurricane Katrina.

02:27:21.260 --> 02:27:22.260
Oh, that's depressing.

02:27:22.260 --> 02:27:28.260
Yeah, I loaned it to somebody who was a wind major.

02:27:28.260 --> 02:27:29.260
Bastards.

02:27:29.260 --> 02:27:31.260
How dare they?

02:27:31.260 --> 02:27:37.260
Well, I mean, you know, it's not much you can do about the hurricane, but my clarinet is long gone.

02:27:37.260 --> 02:27:40.260
I think it ended up going to one of my nieces who doesn't even talk to me, so whatever.

02:27:40.260 --> 02:27:43.260
Whatever is what it is.

02:27:43.260 --> 02:27:48.260
I was about to say the same thing, but moving right along with the whole Skype thing.

02:27:48.260 --> 02:27:53.260
Oh, good lord almighty.

02:27:53.260 --> 02:27:55.260
What? What are you having a laugh about?

02:27:55.260 --> 02:27:59.260
Just laughing from what you're stressing with.

02:27:59.260 --> 02:28:02.260
I lived it, and it was not fun.

02:28:02.260 --> 02:28:08.260
When Microsoft said Skype 7 was being discontinued, I'm like, okay.

02:28:08.260 --> 02:28:13.260
I had to find out all of my stuff, which version of Windows everybody's running, and figure shit out.

02:28:13.260 --> 02:28:19.260
And I'm like, let's try doing this show on Discord.

02:28:19.260 --> 02:28:25.260
Within the first ten minutes of it live, the lag was just atrocious.

02:28:25.260 --> 02:28:30.260
During the musical break, we jumped back onto Skype and just rolled with it.

02:28:30.260 --> 02:28:37.260
Because at that time, they were still trying to make Skype 8 a little bit nicer, a little bit better.

02:28:37.260 --> 02:28:40.260
But now it's good.

02:28:40.260 --> 02:28:46.260
The only thing is that it automatically adjusts your volume when you're talking.

02:28:46.260 --> 02:28:50.260
And I keep disabling that, but it turns itself back off.

02:28:50.260 --> 02:28:54.260
I hate that. Why do things turn themselves back on?

02:28:55.260 --> 02:29:02.260
I will say this. When I play back the episode in the edits, it's solid going across, so I can't complain.

02:29:02.260 --> 02:29:09.260
I know some podcasters are going to Discord, and Discord actually has a robot out there that you can download.

02:29:09.260 --> 02:29:14.260
It's not an official Discord thing, but it'll actually help you record podcasts, which is interesting.

02:29:14.260 --> 02:29:18.260
It's not great for live, but for the recorded stuff, it's another option.

02:29:18.260 --> 02:29:21.260
Had. My other podcast, we used that.

02:29:21.260 --> 02:29:26.260
Come to find out, I wasn't getting links to the episodes that they were recording.

02:29:26.260 --> 02:29:29.260
Come to find out, the people running that bot shut it down.

02:29:29.260 --> 02:29:31.260
Oh no.

02:29:31.260 --> 02:29:39.260
Yeah, so now if I can't record the show, whoever's on it has to either fire up Audition or Audacity to record it.

02:29:39.260 --> 02:29:44.260
Dump it to me in OneDrive or Dropbox, and I do the edits and upload.

02:29:44.260 --> 02:29:56.260
But I will say this. When you're going to Windows 10 and Skype, you may have to definitely switch to a USB mixer or a USB sound card.

02:29:56.260 --> 02:30:03.260
Because I notice with a lot of regular sound cards, when recording, it doesn't pick up both sides of the conversation.

02:30:05.260 --> 02:30:07.260
I mean, but it's not that bad.

02:30:07.260 --> 02:30:13.260
I know, but do you see why I've been stuck on Windows XP this whole time? Because it works. It works for what I need it for.

02:30:13.260 --> 02:30:22.260
I know, but when you're not trying to shill, not trying to shill, when you step into 10, you're going to be like, why haven't I not done this before?

02:30:22.260 --> 02:30:30.260
Uh, maybe. I'll be more like, everything is different in herp derp technology.

02:30:30.260 --> 02:30:36.260
Well, you have my number. You know you can message me or call me anytime and I'll give you that text support.

02:30:36.260 --> 02:30:38.260
I know. Anytime about anything?

02:30:38.260 --> 02:30:40.260
Oh, you know it, baby.

02:30:41.260 --> 02:30:43.260
Uh, Rob, anything else in your mind tonight?

02:30:43.260 --> 02:30:52.260
Uh, no, that's it. No, that's basically it. I'm just getting ready for the work week and how we do, you know.

02:30:52.260 --> 02:30:56.260
Alright, well best of luck. At least you got Halloween this week, so something to mix it up a little.

02:30:56.260 --> 02:30:59.260
Halloween and three bottles of booze in the freezer.

02:30:59.260 --> 02:31:02.260
Sounds good. Alright, take care my friend. I'm going to let you go.

02:31:02.260 --> 02:31:04.260
You too. And Rob, stay fabulous.

02:31:04.260 --> 02:31:06.260
I always do.

02:31:06.260 --> 02:31:08.260
That's what I'm talking about, honey.

02:31:08.260 --> 02:31:10.260
Bye.

02:31:10.260 --> 02:31:15.260
Alright, I think that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight and we're going to wrap up the show tonight.

02:31:15.260 --> 02:31:20.260
As we always say though at the end of OLR, if you enjoyed what you heard, please tell a friend or two about the show.

02:31:20.260 --> 02:31:27.260
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if the voices are here to air out there and spread around the world.

02:31:27.260 --> 02:31:32.260
So, please help us spread the word of Orange D'Andrea because clearly we're not going away anytime soon.

02:31:33.260 --> 02:31:40.260
Thank you as always again for listening and participating with the show tonight, whether it was live here at the Voice Gees Network or via our podcast feed.

02:31:40.260 --> 02:31:45.260
A nice five star review wherever you found this show at a place like iTunes or wherever you're listening to this show.

02:31:45.260 --> 02:31:51.260
Those go a very long way, so please help us out. We would really appreciate it with some good reviews for OLR.

02:31:52.260 --> 02:32:00.260
Dark Sakura, thank you for being here tonight. Missed having you live in studio, although many people don't realize you're actually in studio.

02:32:00.260 --> 02:32:08.260
You're just not here Sunday nights. You're usually here on Friday or something, making some magic with the radio.

02:32:08.260 --> 02:32:11.260
It was nice to have you here on a Sunday night.

02:32:11.260 --> 02:32:17.260
It's good to be back. I'm just really kind of tired of how my schedule is working.

02:32:17.260 --> 02:32:18.260
Yeah, I understand.

02:32:18.260 --> 02:32:19.260
We'll see what happens.

02:32:19.260 --> 02:32:23.260
But look at you. You're a career girl and things are moving in the direction you want to.

02:32:23.260 --> 02:32:25.260
February is when our next change is, so we'll see what happens.

02:32:25.260 --> 02:32:28.260
Fingers and toes crossed. Well, any final thoughts for our listeners in the meantime?

02:32:28.260 --> 02:32:31.260
Um, your cat's loud.

02:32:31.260 --> 02:32:34.260
I know. Did you just hear Alan yelling?

02:32:34.260 --> 02:32:35.260
Shut up.

02:32:35.260 --> 02:32:37.260
That's good.

02:32:37.260 --> 02:32:41.260
I gotta go to the grocery store too to get butter for more cookies.

02:32:42.260 --> 02:32:49.260
More cookies. My final thought tonight is thank you, Dark Sakura, for the Girl Scout Cookie Thin Mint Coffee.

02:32:49.260 --> 02:32:52.260
Yes, the moment I saw that, I was like, heck yeah.

02:32:52.260 --> 02:32:54.260
Fantastic. And just what I needed this evening.

02:32:54.260 --> 02:32:55.260
Awesome.

02:32:55.260 --> 02:32:57.260
Last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:32:57.260 --> 02:33:03.260
My final thought is, I guess I'm going to try to figure out how to install Fourth Mix Plus on my machine this week.

02:33:03.260 --> 02:33:10.260
And I'm going to work on my step mania setup to also get that installed at some point.

02:33:10.260 --> 02:33:19.260
And then, um, follow me on Twitch. Twitch.tv slash Loki O-L-R.

02:33:19.260 --> 02:33:20.260
Alright.

02:33:20.260 --> 02:33:23.260
So we can get that affiliate status for some reason.

02:33:23.260 --> 02:33:24.260
For biddies.

02:33:24.260 --> 02:33:25.260
For biddies, I guess.

02:33:25.260 --> 02:33:27.260
They just gave it to me for no reason.

02:33:27.260 --> 02:33:28.260
Because you're special.

02:33:28.260 --> 02:33:32.260
But I'll be streaming tomorrow, hopefully. Yeah, I've been trying to stream every day.

02:33:32.260 --> 02:33:38.260
Like, Friday, this is my, I guess I'm just not used to, because I've been playing more difficult songs.

02:33:38.260 --> 02:33:43.260
I've been playing heavy songs, which I may cut back on that a little bit, because I've been failing a lot of that shit.

02:33:43.260 --> 02:33:50.260
Because especially doing, like, I'm not used to playing for like an hour straight playing, you know, heavy non-stop songs.

02:33:50.260 --> 02:33:52.260
Because it's four songs in a row, just non-stop.

02:33:52.260 --> 02:34:00.260
Like in the other day, I had like, hey, it's Paranoid Evolution, followed by somewhat of an easier song, followed by, you know, um.

02:34:00.260 --> 02:34:02.260
Oh god, what the fuck was it?

02:34:02.260 --> 02:34:07.260
It was, um, some other fucking hard Fifth Mix song.

02:34:07.260 --> 02:34:14.260
Um, so I was just like, okay, I can't, like, I literally feel like my heart's gonna explode at some point.

02:34:14.260 --> 02:34:18.260
So not to die on stream, I have to stop what I'm doing.

02:34:18.260 --> 02:34:19.260
Good call.

02:34:19.260 --> 02:34:20.260
You know.

02:34:20.260 --> 02:34:22.260
But, so, let me kick it back a little bit easier.

02:34:22.260 --> 02:34:25.260
But, Fourth Mix, you know, there's gonna be plenty to go through.

02:34:25.260 --> 02:34:30.260
Um, I don't know if I'll have it installed tomorrow, but, um, I'll read up on it.

02:34:30.260 --> 02:34:32.260
I still have to burn the disc for it, so.

02:34:32.260 --> 02:34:42.260
Well, actually, I technically have Fourth Mix, I think I actually have a legit Fourth Mix, plus I have almost all the mixes in a box next to the machine that you can't see off-screen.

02:34:42.260 --> 02:34:46.260
But, um, I could probably reinstall those, but.

02:34:46.260 --> 02:34:47.260
Alright.

02:34:47.260 --> 02:34:48.260
Superdisc.

02:34:48.260 --> 02:34:49.260
Alright, uh, that's it.

02:34:49.260 --> 02:34:53.260
We're gonna see you in seven days, and we'll do this all over again with another episode of OLR.

02:34:53.260 --> 02:34:57.260
Until then, happy gaming, have a safe week, and don't be a dick to people online.

02:34:57.260 --> 02:34:58.260
Bye.

02:34:58.260 --> 02:35:02.260
