7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	21000	This week, Microsoft's cloud grows larger as they announce a streaming service that lets you play Xbox games, joining in the list of an ever increasing number of services past and present.
21000	27000	That's just one story in another week of gaming news. Stay tuned for so much more, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	43000	Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 748 for this October the 14th of 2018.
43000	48000	My name is Rob Roberts, here in studio with you, and joining me as always, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
48000	49000	Hello.
49000	50000	Hi, Loki.
50000	51000	Hi.
51000	59000	But DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers, she is still off due to work conflicts. She'll be joining us a little later in the show for the Classic Game of the Week.
59000	65000	Before we went on air tonight, Loki, we were talking a little bit, reminiscing a bit about laser tag, which I know is one of your favorite things to discuss.
65000	66000	It is.
66000	80000	So, and the reason why this topic came up is that one of my buddies in Ingress mentioned that there's a new laser tag place that just opened up by, like a lot of the crew here in Ingress will meet up at that restaurant.
80000	83000	And I can't remember the name, I shouldn't say on air either, because I don't want to give away anywhere I live.
83000	89000	But there's a restaurant thing, and there's a lot of portals there, slash pokestops, so if you play that, that works too.
89000	94000	So a lot of times we kind of meet up there to, you know, build a bot for gear and eat, you know, and that whole stuff.
94000	104000	So right, I guess right around the corner or whatever from there is some new laser tag place. It's like two stories, the biggest one in Sacramento, I guess.
104000	108000	And I was like, oh, this sounds up Loki's alley, actually.
108000	110000	But you didn't know, you didn't know about this thing.
110000	121000	They're not Cuzar, though, in that stealing bad thing. Like, I keep playing, was it, I've been, my kids like going to play laser tag at Golf Land in Roseville, so.
121000	122000	That's too bad.
122000	125000	And it's laser runners, the system that they have there.
125000	128000	Have they changed that laser tag since like 97 when that place opened?
128000	134000	The guns have been updated, because the old guns look like they used to be just like some piece of foam with like electrical tape wrapped around them.
134000	140000	I like swear to God, they were just electrical tape and just like a tiny little laser pointers surrounded with duct tape.
140000	148000	And it was, I think they've added sensors to the guns, too, because like they used to be able to just like duck behind a wall and just keep your gun out and just shoot everybody because there's no sensors on the gun.
148000	150000	So you can just get away with that.
150000	162000	Now, for the listeners that don't know, like you were like, I don't want to say you were pro with laser tag, but you were like, like, if that was a thing that people streamed on Twitch, you would be like a well-known player.
162000	164000	I would bet anything at this point.
164000	167000	I played over 2000 games of Qsar.
167000	168000	That's amazing.
168000	171000	I got a job there just to play more Qsar.
171000	172000	Briefly.
172000	173000	That's the life, though.
173000	176000	It sucked, but there's lots of free games.
176000	179000	It's minimum wage, but you have free games and that more than paid for.
179000	184000	Well, it's minimum wage plus you aren't spending the money on the games.
184000	187000	So did you have to be like the marshal that was protecting?
187000	188000	Yeah.
188000	197000	So what was like the craziest stupid thing that you ever saw go down in a game that you like had like step in and go, sir, don't do that.
197000	201000	I don't remember anything really out like that is crazy.
201000	207000	We did have to come in one time because they had rented the place out for a rave like the night before.
207000	210000	And so, like, it was a mess.
210000	215000	Like, so, like, we did they keep the walls up for the maze and everything they had to raise?
215000	223000	Yeah, they basically like everybody would pay to go in to play laser tag, but they wouldn't play laser tag because they're tripping on stuff and just like staring at the lights in the smoke.
223000	231000	And so apparently I didn't get to actually see it because I know, you know, there was a cuddle puddle in the enemy base.
231000	237000	No, the cuddle puddle was actually in the what the hell game was that?
237000	245000	It was because if y'all what's the Atari game that like the big one, they get to sit like the cockpit and like it's vector tanks and stuff.
245000	246000	What was that zone?
246000	248000	Yes, it was in battle zone.
248000	251000	The cuddle was in your cockpit.
251000	254000	Was in battle zone.
254000	255000	No, no, no, it wasn't about them.
255000	257000	I'm sorry, we didn't have battles that we had T-MEC.
257000	261000	It was T-MEC that they were OK.
261000	265000	I'm just for those of you that like never been to a rave like I went to a couple in college.
265000	267000	OK, those were the years like I was in college.
267000	270000	And hard driving, I believe hard driving had some action too.
270000	277000	There was a lot of people at raves that would be on, you know, substances like ecstasy that heightened a lot of senses.
277000	284000	So it'd be very common to see people just kind of like cuddling because that was, you know, that's what those things do to you.
284000	286000	So that's what a cuddle puddle was basically.
286000	287000	So anyway.
287000	291000	Yeah, so T-MEC and hard driving.
292000	296000	So anyway, so so this mess had gone on at the rave and you were just you guys were just like, yeah, we got that.
296000	298000	We were a cleanup crew the next morning. So that kind of thing.
298000	301000	Thankfully, when we got there, most of the stuff has been done is just, you know.
301000	305000	Yeah, it's a mess. Like you have to sweep up all the cocaine. It's unfortunate, probably.
305000	308000	Yeah. So it was just yeah.
308000	311000	There wasn't anything really too crazy. I don't. Nothing that really stands out.
311000	320000	So, OK, but yeah, I mean, we had a lot of a lot of times where the smoke set off the fire alarms.
320000	323000	Oh, that was, you know, usually like the fake dry ice of the dry.
323000	328000	Yeah, I don't like that stuff. They're fake smoke. Like, I'm not like allergic to the fog machines or whatever, but I just like that.
328000	332000	That's when I inhale, like I'm sitting in a theater that uses it for a performance.
332000	339000	I was like, oh, I think it's just like I seriously miss it because that was like one of the best laser tag systems I've ever played with.
339000	342000	They have some nearby, but they're not.
342000	345000	I say there's one in Concord because we were driving.
346000	349000	It's called the entertainment zone there, but they have Cuzar there.
349000	354000	And then there's one that's in Stars, which is a bowling alley in Vacaville.
354000	358000	But both I think the Concord ones kept up a little bit better and they have a lot of music games and stuff there.
358000	363000	So that's pretty cool. But it's like it's that's a good hour and a half hour drive.
363000	367000	You know, it's it's pretty long, long time to get there.
367000	370000	They have theirs, but there's a ton of laser tag places nearby.
370000	372000	I haven't found one that's been good.
372000	373000	Yeah, I hear you.
373000	376000	Nothing to that level of Cuzar.
377000	384000	Let me let me say hi to our chatters, because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network.
384000	387000	VOG Network dot com. That's VOG Network dot com.
387000	390000	And you can join us if you do happen to be listening live.
390000	393000	Come on in our chat room over at live dot vog network dot com.
393000	398000	Our pal Bobby Black Wolf, who's on before us, says, I knew the Marshall speech at Cuzar.
398000	402000	I was an addict there. I actually gave the briefing a couple times.
403000	408000	Awesome. We should totally play. I hope I don't know if they have any arenas left.
408000	411000	There's not many left because Cuzar went under.
411000	416000	I think they got bought back up there like in the UK now, but it's not like the original owners or anything.
416000	420000	And there's not many around there. They're not really producing new equipment, I don't think.
420000	427000	Well, you know, a lot of these type of places are coming back and entertainment places are becoming more and more popular is because
427000	433000	things like Sears, Macy's, Kmart, these types of things are going under.
433000	437000	And so it's like there's only so many types of things that can fill in that space.
437000	440000	You see a lot of gyms. I know in my neck of the woods, gyms are very popular.
440000	446000	In Southern California, like medical groups, large medical offices are going in a lot of places where grocery stores are.
446000	451000	But like entertainment, like that's how we're getting around one in Roseville.
451000	454000	The very first Cuzar that I played in was probably one of the coolest ones.
454000	460000	And speaking about taking up places that used to have something else, my favorite one was in San Jose.
460000	467000	It was near the East Ridge Mall and it was underground because it was in an old like Jiffy Lube or something like that.
467000	471000	So with our stockroom that was underground was where the arena was.
471000	475000	Because I remember we walked in there like, well, this building's not big enough to have an arena.
475000	477000	Where the hell's the arena for this thing?
477000	482000	And my friend's like, it's downstairs. I'm like, oh, there's a downstairs.
482000	485000	And they actually had two arenas that were next to each other.
485000	489000	And then when it was slow, they'd open the thing in the middle and it would just be this super huge arena.
489000	490000	Oh shit, that sounds fun.
490000	492000	They had this like giant bunker in the middle.
492000	493000	Ah, good times.
493000	494000	Good times.
494000	498000	That reminds me of the, I mean, it's the throwback episode of OLR.
498000	502000	That reminds me of this miniature golf place we had in town called the Mineshaft.
502000	504000	You've got to remember that back from the heyday, right?
504000	509000	Where it's kind of like you look at the golf course outside and you're like, it looks big, but not that big.
509000	511000	But it's because it started underground.
511000	513000	And that's why they called it the Mineshaft.
513000	515000	You would go underground in the basement for like the first five holes.
515000	517000	And it had that whole little like cave theme.
517000	519000	And then you go upstairs and that's it.
519000	522000	I think that place is like an RV shop now or something.
522000	523000	It was a huge building.
523000	524000	Oh no, it's a haunted house right now.
524000	526000	Because there's advertisements everywhere.
526000	527000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
527000	528000	It is.
528000	529000	Heartstoppers!
529000	530000	Yeah, yeah, that's, that's, I forgot.
530000	531000	It's the time of year for that.
531000	535000	That's the other thing all those grocery stores turn into are the limited time Halloween shops.
535000	538000	Lots of miniature golf courses turning into haunted houses.
538000	549000	There's also the one that was behind the old mall that we have over here where now it's like police storage slash perpetual haunted house run down piece of crap, you know.
549000	556000	But it's interesting how, you know, and this is something that's going to be, I know this isn't directly about video games, but in a way it's still like the entertainment and everything.
557000	566000	And because of the fact you're probably buying more of your video games online and you're going, not necessarily just amazon.com, but even using like walmart.com or bestbuy.com.
566000	570000	I think a lot of you are probably, or just buying your games digitally as a lot of people are doing.
570000	575000	And I think because less people are going to, you know, places like Sears.
575000	577000	I remember my Nintendo came from Sears.
577000	580000	But like you don't think of Sears as a video game shop anymore, right?
580000	582000	My, when I say my Nintendo, my NES back then.
582000	585000	Your GameCube came from Circuit City.
585000	588000	Right? And these, these places don't really exist anymore.
588000	592000	But you know, these other types of shop and it's only going to be even different in like 10 years.
592000	593000	Like what? It's in the headlines right now.
593000	598000	Speaking of Sears, they're looking at bankruptcy protection and they're going to probably close half their stores.
598000	600000	The one nearby me already closed down.
600000	601000	It already went under.
601000	605000	Which is the one that I got my NES at when I was like nine years old. Crazy.
605000	608000	It's a big empty, that whole mall is just on borrowed time.
608000	609000	Yeah.
609000	612000	Yeah. Anyway, it's interesting. It's interesting to see how that all go.
612000	614000	Anyway, go into chat at live.vognetwork.com.
614000	617000	SJ100Matt points out there is a QZR in Long Island.
617000	620000	Glow in the dark mini golf places are also on the rise.
620000	624000	Yeah, that's like the Monster Golf out by the mine shaft.
624000	626000	Yeah, lots of entertainment places there opening up.
626000	631000	I mean, it's kind of like a boom again, but I don't know.
631000	635000	Yeah. I would think a lot of those types of places are so hit and miss too, but.
635000	639000	They are sometimes, but like it's birthday parties. I mean, it gets to drive it.
639000	642000	Or did you hear about, uh, in San Jose, I mean a little bit of a drive,
642000	645000	but surely at some point in your life, you went to the Valco mall in San, right?
645000	648000	Right. Coopty. It's like, it's like I used to live in San Jose.
648000	650000	Okay. It's like across the street from Apple's new building, right?
650000	654000	The Valco mall. Bye bye. They're bulldozing it. Bye bye.
654000	656000	It went under and it's going to be condos.
656000	658000	I was going to say more Apple more, no more housing,
658000	661000	more housing for the employees at that Apple building.
661000	665000	So which is that big, that fancy one that looks like a glass spaceship or whatever.
665000	667000	Anyway, it is a spaceship.
667000	669000	That's, they're just not telling me that.
669000	672000	All right. Uh, we should get into some other gaming.
672000	675000	So I mean, it's kind of interesting to talk about these retail shops
675000	678000	and things we do in our spare time. Some of y'all I'm sure have memories too,
678000	682000	but let's get into, we are looking at the future a little bit.
682000	684000	And I think for our kickoff topic tonight,
684000	688000	this might be a little look at the future of what gaming might be.
688000	690000	I mean, we, this is kind of a follow up, right?
690000	692000	Loki, we've talked about this before.
692000	696000	So, you know, Microsoft, um, there'd been rumors that they've been launching
696000	700000	a, some sort of streaming service that's going to go along with the Xbox one,
700000	704000	perhaps like even just a streaming only console or a digital, you know,
704000	706000	console without a drive.
706000	711000	Well, apparently now they've started talking about Project X cloud.
711000	715000	It's going to be a streaming service that allow you to stream Xbox one games
715000	721000	to computers, phones, and tablets.
721000	724000	And basically they said with Project X cloud,
724000	730000	our goal is to deliver quality experience for all gamers on all devices
730000	734000	that is consistent with speed and high fidelity gamers experience
734000	738000	and expect on their PC and consoles.
738000	742000	So yeah, I mean, cool.
742000	747000	I wonder if this is the future of gaming is going to be more of this streaming stuff,
747000	752000	you know, processing in the cloud, whatever you want to call it on like a supercomputer.
752000	755000	So that way you're just looking, you know, as well.
755000	758000	I know we talked about this a little bit last week because, you know,
758000	761000	we have, uh, somebody brought up like the issue of latency and all that,
761000	763000	but that's just going to improve as technology.
763000	769000	Yeah. And apparently, well, my thought was like needed like a really huge, um,
769000	773000	bit of bandwidth to do this, but apparently it's not, not as large as I thought.
773000	776000	And they're even seen to help with mitigate some of this stuff.
776000	779000	They're actually installing these special servers in data centers,
779000	784000	which are basically Xbox ones, um, just multiple Xbox ones in there.
784000	788000	So they're going to be, um, doing that as well to kind of help with this,
788000	791000	but it's pretty funny. And then along with that, you know, we have,
791000	794000	was it Project Stream, which is the Android or the, um,
794000	799000	Google service that you've been able if you like signed into it, the beta,
799000	805000	they have the Assassin's Creed Odyssey, um, trial that you can do.
805000	809000	So you can actually play Assassin's Creed Odyssey in your Google Chrome
809000	814000	browser. Um, which is kind of cool. I did not sign into that,
814000	817000	but thought about it.
817000	819000	Now, uh, looking at chat at live.vognetwork.com,
819000	823000	Rage Nator says one word on live. And then of course,
823000	825000	I think about the Phantom. Remember the Phantom console?
825000	828000	Because I thought that was a big way that that was supposed to work too,
828000	831000	was going to be a lot of like in the cloud processing or what have you.
831000	834000	So it's, it's kind of weird to think that maybe some of these companies
834000	837000	were just like way ahead of their time in a way that, you know,
837000	840000	and we've talked about this in more rural parts of the country,
840000	842000	like, you know, Alaska or heck,
842000	845000	even just like rural parts of here in California that aren't the big cities,
845000	848000	you know, maybe they don't have the internet to support this.
848000	850000	And back in like 2003, 2004,
850000	853000	we were talking about the Phantom more commonly.
853000	857000	They certainly weren't that, but now again, internet's getting faster.
857000	858000	Internet's getting better.
858000	862000	Like just here in this past couple of weeks here in SAC where we live,
862000	865000	they just started rolling out that 5g service. You know what that means?
865000	869000	You get cable fast internet through the air,
869000	872000	no more cable internet without the cable. That's 5g. Yeah.
872000	877000	So that's starting here. Now we sadly at OLR studios,
877000	881000	we don't have that because technically I don't live in the downtown area,
881000	885000	which is where all of this is being kind of piloted, but it's coming.
885000	889000	It's downtown now. What's it going to look like in five years? You know,
889000	892000	at least it's Sacramento and not San Francisco because that's a little bit
892000	895000	further to go. Well, I'm sure they're getting some form of it too,
895000	898000	but the reason why they pay, and I know Sacramento isn't the only city,
898000	899000	they're doing a handful of cities,
899000	902000	but one of the reasons why they picked Sacramento is that the city kind of
902000	904000	welcomed it. The city was like, Oh,
904000	907000	you want to put devices on all these telephone poles? Sure. Go for it.
907000	911000	Like the city really welcomed it. Whereas I'm sure in San Francisco,
911000	913000	there's a lot of red tape.
913000	915000	I think that comes a lot of stuff that you want to do there.
915000	919000	So it was just like easier to try it here, you know? So.
919000	923000	Is it an olive branch because of the throttling of services for our
923000	928000	firefighters? That's a much more complicated issue. I don't feel.
928000	931000	I'll tell you what, you know, you just forget about the whole throttling thing.
931000	936000	We'll just give you a 5g in Sacramento. Uh, nifty in chat says,
936000	939000	but what about Comcast data caps? Special plans for gamers.
939000	944000	I think those data caps are going to have to give to larger data caps.
945000	948000	As the average consumer consumes more data.
948000	952000	Like why do the data caps exist in the first place right now? I mean,
952000	954000	easy moneymaker, I guess, but I,
954000	959000	I get the sense that one of the reasons why those were put into place in the
959000	962000	beginning was to try to kind of curb piracy a little bit.
962000	966000	It was kind of an answer to BitTorrent in some ways is that if you leave your
966000	969000	BitTorrent running all the time and you're uploading these, you know,
969000	973000	one or two gigabyte episodes of game of thrones pretty quickly,
973000	978000	that's going to really eat away at your bandwidth. And so this was one way I,
978000	981000	that was always kind of part of the, I mean, don't get me wrong.
981000	983000	Yeah. I mean, don't get me wrong.
983000	987000	There's some of this whole more and more people are cutting the cord and
987000	992000	getting rid of their television altogether. We have to make money somehow.
992000	993000	But like,
993000	998000	I know a lot of people downtown that are thinking of dropping Comcast and
998000	1001000	switching to Verizon to get the 5g like that is,
1001000	1003000	that's where the competition is going to go is like,
1003000	1008000	how fast can you get me my internet? How good and clean and, and you know,
1008000	1010000	uh, without noise,
1010000	1013000	can you get my internet so I can stream video games or do whatever I want to do?
1013000	1016000	I would love to have competition in my neighborhood, you know,
1016000	1020000	and I have Verizon for my phone, which is, yeah, it's all right.
1020000	1022000	I get discount through work.
1022000	1024000	Hopefully it's still get discount through the 5g,
1024000	1029000	which I think it would because they actually were at our work for a vendor
1029000	1031000	fair type thing. And I talked to him, I'm like, yeah,
1031000	1034000	I'm looking for that 5g coming in. He's like, hi, yo, me too.
1034000	1039000	Cause the guy is like, didn't quite live in Sacramento. Yeah. But, um,
1039000	1043000	hopefully soon. But I would, yeah, drop them in the heartbeat.
1043000	1046000	So back to the topic at hand where I really wanted to go with this discussion
1046000	1048000	because I think we need to kind of have a serious look at this,
1048000	1053000	especially when we're talking about things like PlayStation five next box,
1053000	1057000	whatever they end up doing there. Uh, and heck even Nintendo.
1057000	1061000	I mean, we've kind of blinked and missed it sort of thing, but,
1061000	1063000	and probably because this is more prevalent in Japan,
1063000	1066000	I think they released one of them here, but not the other,
1066000	1070000	but Japan has that resident evil seven and Assassin's Creed Odyssey because
1070000	1071000	they're running, they're streaming.
1071000	1074000	That's how they're getting the powerful games to run on the switch.
1074000	1078000	They're streaming them. So kind of those LOL.
1078000	1082000	Nintendo is under power to run stuff may not last much longer.
1082000	1086000	I think there's a very big potential Nintendo's next system.
1086000	1089000	I mean, I think, well, they're going to stay invested in the switch for a good
1089000	1093000	long time, but Nintendo may be the first, if anybody to be like,
1093000	1099000	not everything is going to be this streaming thing because it's the way that
1099000	1103000	we can deliver like huge technology, but not pass on that cost to you.
1103000	1107000	I think the streaming thing is good to a point, but like right now,
1107000	1111000	like I can't, I don't think we're going to be able to stream 4k gameplay.
1111000	1116000	You're like, you're not going to get Xbox one X quality gameplay streaming.
1116000	1117000	You're not going to get that.
1117000	1122000	But you know, if you just want Xbox one type gameplay,
1122000	1125000	then those visuals, you probably could do that.
1125000	1130000	It's just, I don't think, I don't think it's going to be as good as the console,
1130000	1135000	but it'll definitely fill gaps for like some consoles that are under powered
1135000	1138000	that could run some of these games in that way.
1138000	1140000	It's another way to deliver that to a few more platforms.
1140000	1145000	Going to chat at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Lackwolf says,
1145000	1148000	I think now that net neutrality is gone for everywhere but California,
1148000	1149000	they could just sell it.
1149000	1151000	Didn't Washington do something similar anyway,
1151000	1154000	but they could just sell you tiers that exempt certain sites in the data cap.
1154000	1157000	So you'll still have a data cap and under your traffic to Fortnite
1157000	1159000	and other registered gaming services will count against it for your
1159000	1161000	$9.99 extra a month on your bill.
1161000	1163000	Key term, registered gaming services,
1163000	1166000	which means AAA games and not indie games,
1166000	1169000	AAA studios will have to pay to be a part of their tier.
1169000	1171000	I think with the whole net neutrality thing, though,
1171000	1173000	you know, without getting too political,
1173000	1176000	I think one thing we have to remember is that the government works for us.
1176000	1181000	And when the government swings way too far into special interests,
1181000	1186000	which is, you know, they're misinformed by these special interest campaigns
1186000	1187000	that are trying to...
1187000	1189000	They're not misinformed, they're paid off.
1189000	1191000	You know what I mean.
1191000	1194000	Where it's basically guiding their hand to sign off on a lot of these things.
1194000	1196000	I think you're seeing a lot of people rise up and saying,
1196000	1198000	I think the fuck not.
1198000	1200000	And that's why you're seeing this happen at the state level.
1200000	1202000	Ironically by Verizon, too.
1202000	1204000	Oh?
1204000	1209000	Yeah, G-Pi, I think he was with Verizon prior to his current role.
1209000	1212000	Oh, well, shock, shock, shock upon shocks.
1212000	1214000	But I think, again, I think even though, yes,
1214000	1216000	that's something that happened at the federal level,
1216000	1218000	I think you're going to see more and more states,
1218000	1220000	especially after what California did,
1220000	1222000	I think you're just going to see more states pass a similar type of policy
1222000	1224000	and it'll be the people.
1224000	1230000	Honestly, like, I see a lot of very tense shit on Twitter, you know,
1230000	1233000	when it comes to blue team versus red team.
1233000	1235000	And I don't really want to get into that right now.
1235000	1239000	But I think one place where we all kind of come together,
1239000	1242000	for the most part, certainly it would have not passed
1242000	1245000	if there weren't some people that felt net neutrality was a bad thing.
1245000	1247000	But I think for the most part, there's a lot of people from the red team
1247000	1250000	that would, you know, cross over and say,
1250000	1253000	yeah, Ajit did not do a good thing here
1253000	1256000	and net neutrality is overall a good thing.
1256000	1258000	So at least that's the vibe I get on Twitter
1258000	1260000	is that most people are on the same page there.
1260000	1263000	So at least that's one thing I feel like we can kind of get going
1263000	1265000	is, you know, striking these things that were signed.
1265000	1268000	The problem is you have really old people in Congress in the House
1268000	1270000	that don't get it.
1270000	1272000	They don't understand what the Internet is.
1272000	1274000	And they don't understand.
1274000	1276000	Remember when we were in awe.
1276000	1280000	Like, we were really surprised when, gosh darn it,
1280000	1285000	I don't, oh, it was the Schwarzenegger versus person law.
1285000	1287000	I'm sorry, it was person versus Schwarzenegger.
1287000	1289000	Somebody on the channel will know the name.
1289000	1291000	But it was they struck down that law where they were going to have,
1291000	1293000	you had to be 18 or up to buy a game at GameStop.
1293000	1295000	Remember that whole thing?
1295000	1298000	But the term, what a mature game was, was too gray.
1298000	1302000	So that was the problem is that somebody else was basically going to have to tell us
1302000	1304000	what was good for us and what was not.
1304000	1306000	And it ended up getting struck down by the Supreme Court.
1306000	1308000	And we were all kind of like, whoa,
1308000	1315000	because in one of the justices things supporting the decision to strike down the law
1315000	1318000	talked about how people on their staff played Mortal Kombat
1318000	1320000	and all this stuff growing up.
1320000	1324000	They had to learn from their legal clerks about what Mortal Kombat was.
1324000	1327000	I don't want to misplace it, but I want to say it was Justice Kennedy.
1327000	1331000	Maybe somebody in chat remembers that whole thing and can correct me.
1331000	1335000	But that like people on his legal staff had to kind of advise,
1335000	1338000	like, you know, guide him a little bit because he didn't know.
1338000	1341000	And you're right, a lot of people making the laws in this country
1341000	1346000	may not necessarily know how a lot of technologies and that stuff works.
1346000	1350000	Okay, Bobby's correcting me. Thank you.
1350000	1354000	It was Schwarzenegger versus EMA, then Brown versus EMA by default
1354000	1356000	when Jerry Brown became governor, took over for Schwarzenegger.
1356000	1361000	And they don't seem to, Black Wolf thinks it was Lena Kagan.
1361000	1364000	And that would make a lot of sense because she would have been the newest justice
1364000	1368000	at the time that that was heard because this was heard before
1368000	1372000	President 45's latest appointees.
1372000	1377000	So it was Justice Kagan, I believe, at that time was the youngest on the court.
1377000	1383000	It may still be if I'm not mistaken, although I'm not sure if the new guy is younger.
1383000	1389000	But anyway, all that aside, by the time, you know, we're not getting any younger, Loki.
1389000	1393000	Our generation, this whole like borderline of Gen X and Millennials,
1393000	1398000	the Zillennials, I know some of you hate that term, but deal with it for the moment.
1398000	1401000	You know, we're going to be approaching that age more and more
1401000	1404000	where I think we're going to see ourselves represented more in politics.
1404000	1407000	You know, and it'll be our generation making some of these rules and stuff.
1407000	1409000	This is interesting.
1409000	1413000	I think that's why they say more and more youth needs to get involved in politics
1413000	1416000	because that's the only way these things kind of change.
1416000	1420000	So I hope you all registered to vote because the deadline passed in some places already.
1420000	1424000	But hopefully, you know, where you're at, if you're not registered to vote, you can take care of that because
1424000	1426000	I got my vote, my available forms.
1426000	1428000	Yeah, me too. Me too.
1428000	1432000	So anyway, wow, we got on a whole tangent there.
1432000	1436000	So we got streaming games and then it got it got all political.
1436000	1438000	Kind of easy to do that this time of year.
1438000	1442000	It is. Well, because because you're right.
1442000	1446000	I mean, the concerns are right about things like net neutrality
1446000	1451000	and the fact that the Comcast and the Verizon of the world can set these rules
1451000	1454000	when it comes to data caps and all that stuff.
1454000	1459000	That's the big concern a lot of people have when it comes to streaming their games full time
1459000	1461000	is, well, what about my data caps and all this stuff?
1461000	1465000	Because, you know, if you're streaming Netflix in 4K all day long,
1465000	1469000	which some people do, you're going to hit those data caps pretty quickly.
1469000	1474000	Which is funny because like Comcast is literally they have their new box that has Netflix built into it.
1474000	1477000	They're advertising, hey, we got Netflix on our box.
1477000	1479000	What doesn't have Netflix?
1479000	1484000	But like I just thought it was funny. It's like, but you're so against that.
1484000	1486000	I'm confused. Who are you?
1486000	1490000	I think in that case, because, you know, Comcast had their own thing.
1490000	1492000	They had the stream flicks or whatever that was called stream pics.
1492000	1495000	I don't know what it's called. I don't even know if it's still stream pics.
1495000	1499000	But I really think that was a case of if you can't beat them, join them.
1500000	1506000	And even Netflix can see from where they're sitting, they see Hulu coming in the picture.
1506000	1511000	They see CBS. They see Disney. Here comes Disney.
1511000	1516000	Here comes what WB Warner Brothers just said in the past week.
1516000	1519000	They're looking at doing something too. Warner Brothers owns all the Harry Potter movies.
1519000	1524000	What? I'm not going to be able to get my CW content anymore? Oh, no.
1524000	1526000	No Buffy the Vampire Slayer for you.
1526000	1529000	Ah, I am disappointed.
1529000	1534000	Yeah. So I do think it's kind of one of those if you can't beat them, join them type of things.
1534000	1542000	So, but, uh, Bobby Black Wolf again, very chatty tonight saying that Comcast does state in the fine print that Netflix does count against your data cap.
1542000	1549000	That is probably honestly though, that is actually a good thing because that is net neutrality in action.
1549000	1554000	If they didn't count Netflix towards your cap, that would not be net neutrality.
1554000	1562000	Right? So even though it's weird to say, and it might kind of suck, that's actually probably a good thing that Netflix counts against your cap.
1562000	1566000	Just like any other traffic would count against you or just, you know, get rid of those data caps.
1566000	1572000	Just like, just like listening to the show. But it's, that's the nice thing of us about us being audio only.
1572000	1577000	It's so, and even when we go to video, like honestly streaming 720 video is not as bad as you'd think.
1577000	1583000	Like I would say, like right now we've been streaming for 28 minutes and we've sent out, I'm looking at the counters.
1583000	1590000	It's ticking up. We don't want, I can't even count all the digits. I think we've sent out 20 megabytes of data and that's it.
1590000	1597000	So it's not that much, all things considered. So it's about a megabyte a minute. Anyway.
1597000	1604000	All right. Anyhow, let's, uh, let's move on. Let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1604000	1606000	Loki, how was your gaming week? What have you been up to?
1606000	1618000	I didn't play much. I played, um, Pokemon Go. I played a lot of that. Um, I played Dance Dance Revolution still because I'm doing that.
1618000	1628000	And someone might, or some people might've been lucky enough to catch my, um, stream on Twitch that I just fucked around with the Twitch mobile app.
1628000	1632000	I missed it. Am I subscribed? I must not be subscribed on Twitch. I didn't see it.
1632000	1639000	It's all right. It wasn't worth watching, honestly. It was a test. It was a test. I was just, hey, there's a mobile app on this thing.
1639000	1646000	What if I prop my phone up? Let's see how well that works. And just, you know, I didn't even have it plugged in and it died after 30 minutes.
1646000	1654000	And I, which is fine, but it was just an experiment. However, with that being said, I am going to be streaming on Twitch.
1654000	1659000	I have gear coming. I have a whole setup that's going to be multi-camera setup plus screen feed.
1659000	1663000	You can't do anything half-assed and that's why you never finish a project.
1663000	1667000	But I've got, I've got it ready to go.
1667000	1669000	Now I'm excited. What's your Twitch name? Loki OLR?
1669000	1670000	Yeah, I believe so.
1670000	1671000	Okay. That's awesome.
1671000	1683000	So, um, yeah, I'll be doing that. The only thing I don't like so far is, um, and I had this happen with the really crappy stream that I did, um, is the muting of audio because
1684000	1695000	synchronized love. Damn you, Joe, whatever your name is. I don't remember his, the musician's name, but damn you for muting my audio during that portion.
1695000	1701000	So you are saving your archives because Twitch doesn't do that by default. You have to tell it to.
1701000	1702000	Yeah, I didn't.
1702000	1703000	Whoops.
1703000	1704000	Well, no, it's fine.
1704000	1707000	How'd you know it got muted then if you don't save your archives?
1707000	1708000	I was able to play it back.
1708000	1710000	Then you're saving your archives. Good job.
1710000	1711000	Oh, I don't remember doing that.
1711000	1712000	Yeah.
1712000	1713000	Cool.
1713000	1728000	I would always turn that on by default anyway. Um, but yeah, well, I mean, I can imagine with DDR there's going to be copyrighted songs if you talk over it because like, like I've played Forza and somehow gotten away with it, but I talk a lot.
1728000	1732000	But it wasn't even like direct audio. It was on a phone across the room.
1732000	1740000	It doesn't matter. You know how YouTube can detect that shit. It's, it's, they use something similar to what like Shazam and those types of apps. Is that the big one Shazam?
1740000	1741000	Yeah.
1741000	1749000	But they, they sound hound, I don't know what they're called, but they, they listen in a similar manner so that you can tell what song is playing. Those similar technology to what operates those apps.
1749000	1756000	Yeah. So, um, I did get, for my DDR machine, I did get replacement CD drive.
1756000	1758000	Tiger Claw found your video in like three seconds.
1758000	1759000	Yeah.
1759000	1760000	But only part of it is muted.
1760000	1769000	Yeah. Well, it's part of it and only part of it was muted and it sucks too because like apparently my, well, I just did this on a whim, like I didn't actually prep for it.
1769000	1775000	So I plugged in my phone, my phone had already, it was down to like 30% anyways. I'm like, eh, it should last long enough for this.
1775000	1787000	And then my laptop, you know, eats through battery like any, like nothing. So I didn't have that plugged in either. So I couldn't tell, you know, in fact, I think the last bit that before it cut out, I'm like, oh, my laptop's dead.
1787000	1797000	You know, cause the battery had gone dead on that. Um, but you know, I actually did play max 300, uh, only on difficult and I did pass it.
1797000	1803000	I was like, oh, cool. And then I was like, oh, it's dead. Oh, no one saw that. Oh, well, but that's fine.
1803000	1814000	Um, but yeah, I'm going to hopefully do that. So then like I said, I got replacement optical drive for my DDR machine so I can do the super disk if I want to and put other mixes on there.
1814000	1824000	Um, I haven't decided if I'm going to do that yet. I am seriously considering a setup with a step mania machine as well.
1824000	1829000	But what I'm actually gonna do a little bit differently with that is I'm going to have it toggleable.
1829000	1835000	So it's going to be, I can flip between step mania machine and arcade hardware when I want to.
1835000	1836000	That sounds like a project.
1837000	1842000	It's actually not, it doesn't seem like it's going to be that hard. It's just, you know, some, uh, splicing of stuff.
1842000	1852000	But for now, just, you know, DDR, I am trying to figure out what songs are going to be flaggable on Twitch. I guess live wise, it doesn't matter.
1852000	1861000	Yeah, it doesn't matter if you're focusing on live. It doesn't matter. I mean, you just, you just have to realize if you're playing a song that really hinges on the music, you're going to probably get muted.
1861000	1867000	Like a lot of music games are going to do this too. If well, like, you know, not like a, um, you know, like the dance mania stuff. Yeah.
1867000	1873000	Yeah. Yeah. If you, if you play things that are big on licensed music, like guitar hero, rock band. Yeah.
1873000	1878000	You know, you're going to get muted because those songs are going to trigger it. So, you know, it's a live only type of thing.
1878000	1880000	And DDR is just kind of the same thing.
1880000	1884000	Yeah. So I'll be doing that, um, you know, as part of my exercise each day.
1884000	1890000	So I'm going to try to push it a little longer and maybe not walk as much during the day so that I actually have energy to do it.
1890000	1894000	Um, so yeah, so look forward to that sometime soon.
1894000	1901000	I just have to get it all set up and test some things. So you may see some test streams, but yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
1901000	1905000	And I think the cameras are coming tomorrow, so I'm, I can't wait.
1905000	1913000	Neat. Um, my gaming week, uh, not, not too thrilling, uh, because I was playing world of Warcraft a bit and working on a new character.
1914000	1918000	So I got my Horde Druid up to 120 and now I'm working on an Alliance Monk.
1918000	1927000	So I'm just kind of, uh, slogging away at that. And I think I've hit level 48, but you know, that's without spending an awful lot of time on it.
1927000	1934000	So that's pretty cool. So I'm happy with the progress there, but otherwise I haven't been playing a lot of otherwise like console stuff and things.
1934000	1942000	Um, a little bit of Forza. I do remember dabbling in Forza a little bit, but, um, keep in mind part of my week, Delvin, who was here on the show last week,
1942000	1952000	he was still here. So we went up to Reno on Monday and I was trying so hard to find him a killer instinct machine because he hasn't played on an actual killer instinct arcade machine in forever.
1952000	1958000	And I thought, Oh, maybe that classic arcade row at Peppermill. Cause you know, Peppermills, I was like, I thought maybe they would have one.
1958000	1966000	They didn't, but they did have that new Ninja Turtles game. So yes, I took a picture of that and put it on Twitter. And so golf land.
1966000	1970000	Oh, do they really? Yeah. Did you play it? I haven't. I didn't get a chance to play it cause some other kids were,
1970000	1976000	and I was just kind of like watching, but it definitely kind of rings true of the old school one. Yeah.
1976000	1985000	I haven't gotten to like it. The problem is like my kids don't have the attention span. Like they, they want to do other things. And so like, Oh hey, let's play Ninja Turtles.
1985000	1992000	I'll play something that spits out tickets. I want to play the candy claw machine. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Of course. Candy claw.
1993000	2002000	Um, so yeah. So, um, actually if, if casino games count as a video games, which they might, they might as well be, it's, it's what Konami does now.
2002000	2011000	Y'all can, I mean, does casino games. Well anyway, so I like to play slot machines a little bit. I'll set myself a limit and, you know, say this is how much I'm going to waste on slot machines today.
2011000	2018000	But anyway, long story short, I went to a wheel of fortune machine that was just on some classic, you know, sevens and bars type of thing.
2018000	2027000	I put the max credit in, put, uh, pulled the thing and it came up on the wheel and it spun the wheel and I won 500 credits. So it was quarters.
2027000	2035000	So ended up being 125 bucks. I love the wheel of fortune machines. Yeah. So that was it. And after that I was like done.
2035000	2045000	So I was very proud of myself for kind of like walking away. Um, but I did also, so this is also funny cause it's play, it's like Vegas dreams IRL.
2045000	2053000	Did y'all ever play Vegas dreams on the super Nintendo? Cause I love that game. We went, it was dead. Reno was dead on Monday because of course it's a Monday.
2053000	2062000	It's a weekday even though it was Columbus day or whatever. I guess nobody really has the day off except maybe banks in the States. So, uh, the casinos were dead.
2062000	2071000	So like the thing that kind of crossed Delvin and I's mind was that if we go up to play a table game, they can actually like kinda interact with us.
2071000	2078000	Like we wouldn't, you know how like with blackjack, you don't want to go play blackjack when you don't know what you're doing cause you'll fuck it up for everybody else at the table.
2078000	2085000	I don't know if you know that, but that's like a thing. If you like hit when you're not supposed to in blackjack, you can, you can like take somebody else's 10 basically and like screw it up.
2085000	2098000	So, um, so I didn't play blackjack, but we played roulette for the first time. So this is just a funny side story. Delvin was like learning about like, kind of like, cause I guess you have to do like a $5 minimum bet.
2098000	2109000	You can spread it out on the inside or you can do it all on one thing on the outside. So the lady was kind of teaching us how to place. So I watched him go through like $20 and then I was like, you know what, I'll play, I'll play for fun.
2109000	2119000	So I put my things down and I put $2 on my mom's birthday, the month in the year, or I'm sorry, the month of the day. And then I put $1 on my birthday, the 26th.
2119000	2130000	Well, guess what? Roulette number came up 26. So I won like 35 bucks or whatever. And I was like, done. That was my one and only game of roulette. Like, cause it's not going to happen to me twice in a row.
2130000	2143000	That was my one and only game of roulette I ever played. So that was kind of fun. Anyway, uh, SSU100Matt in our chat over at live.avag.net.com says, uh, yeah, $125 more money than you've had before.
2143000	2156000	Well, in a way, Matt, that was kind of Reno paying me back for all the money it's taken from me in the past. So, you know, and while it's a nice sum of money, don't get me wrong.
2156000	2170000	It's not that much money. Like it pretty much, it paid for dinner and gas by then it's like, oh, money's gone. But it was nice. It's nice to have the trip to Reno, I guess, on the house, uh, that way. So we had a good time.
2170000	2179000	Um, trying to think of like other, we walked around to some of the arcades, but it's just, it's so sad how the vast majority of arcades are all like, just take any DDR machines to be found.
2179000	2189000	No, believe it or not. No, like a wheat check. Cause we were looking for the killer instinct machine circus circus has a whole new area. What used to be the ice cream shop is all like a subsidiary arcade.
2189000	2201000	Now, no DDR machine in there or anything like it. No, like, like in the groove or anything like that. Uh, nothing at Harris, none of it. Peppermill didn't have it. Huh? Maybe, you know, maybe I just went to the wrong casino.
2201000	2209000	Somebody's probably listening to the show going, I live in Reno. It's over here. Well, we just missed it. I guess it happens. So I used to love the silver legacies buffet.
2210000	2220000	I love casino buffets. That's like my guilty pleasure. Yeah. It's so, uh, so much crap, but it's, it's so much garbage, but it's good. It's a buffet. What do you expect?
2220000	2232000	Well, I'm going to Vegas in November, so there won't be an OLR, uh, November or may actually I might be back in time for it. I don't know. We'd be pushing it a little bit. It was like November 19th or something around that day.
2232000	2240000	There's not going to be an OLR because I'm going to final fantasy fan fest for final fantasy 14, where they'll undoubtedly announce the next expansion that's in Vegas.
2240000	2249000	And, um, so, uh, yeah, probably we'll go to some of the Vegas buffets and all that stuff when I go, go down there for ironically a video game related convention.
2249000	2261000	So anyway, that's my gaming week, pretty much like world of Warcraft and just a few other things here and there. And that's, that's really it forza. That's it watching some Twitch, but not a lot of, uh, otherwise game, but just focusing on that.
2261000	2272000	Um, I started another one of my reality games on Facebook, at least this time I can talk about it. Uh, it's not the whole thing in secret. So there actually might be because some of them heard about my show.
2272000	2282000	So, Hey, if y'all are listening, uh, but, um, yeah, so I know that's going to be another time sink as well, but those are more like social types of games. I really kind of parallel it to D and D.
2283000	2295000	Not everybody agrees with me, but D and D is like a very social thing. That's what these are. They're social games. So anyway, let's get into some gaming news. We'll start it off with the first news story. Loki.
2295000	2305000	Yep. So this is another game that probably got the pickup, even though I've been bad about playing the VR games that I have purchased on the PlayStation four, but this is pretty cool.
2305000	2328000	Borderlands two VR is going to be coming to the PlayStation VR in December 14th. It's a retooled version of Borderlands two. And apparently they have a new mechanic called Banff time or badass mega fun time, which I guess slows down everything, allows people to dodge bullets and do other cool stuff.
2328000	2347000	Um, of course driving is first person now and the weapons, uh, weapons are controlled, I guess, by head movement. And they're saying that, um, you can also choose between the standard controller movement or the point to point teleportation.
2348000	2359000	So neat. I'm curious to see what other cool stuff you could do in this, but I don't know. So I'll probably pick it up because I'm a sucker for that crap.
2359000	2371000	So let me play through Skyrim. Um, I really, I needed like what I needed is I need to move my whole setup away from where I'm at. Hey, that's actually speaking of this whole streaming thing.
2371000	2388000	So one of the thoughts I had was, you know, for the channel is basically calling the thing Loki's garage because it is literally in my garage, but I may end up moving some of my gaming stuff out into the garage because then I can actually play it and talk without interrupting everybody or being annoying.
2388000	2393000	So I may end up sticking with that for other games other than DDR as well.
2393000	2402000	You should look at trying to like insulate the garage a little bit so that it's like tolerable. Well, in the winter it'll be more tolerable. And then like trying to, um, I don't know how you would soundproof.
2402000	2408000	No, not necessarily soundproof, but try to like, uh, for the, for the summer to not get it so fricking hot in there.
2409000	2421000	Uh, yeah, insulation, but the walls do not have insulation in them. I know that for a fact and the roof. Yeah, it would just be, I would like to have it insulate so it's not 115 degrees in the summer.
2421000	2433000	Because Loki's garage will be fun in the winter, but in the summer it's not going to be fun. Summer is not fun. I play DDR in the summer. I will still play DDR in the summer, but it is not. It is opening the garage door and it's sweating your balls off.
2434000	2444000	Uh, let's see. So, uh, Cajudo in chat says, I'm down for Borderlands VR. Yeah. You know what I thought was interesting about this is that this kind of reminded me, weren't we expecting like Borderlands 3 by now?
2444000	2452000	Like shouldn't that have been a thing at this year's E3, but I guess it's just maybe it's just not fully done yet. So this is, this is, you got rage too. That's pretty close.
2452000	2459000	I guess this is kind of the crumbs we're getting to hold us over VR port. Although I want a new Borderlands game. I feel like border.
2459000	2463000	I love and played through the pre-sequel though. So technically I do have a new Borderlands game I haven't played yet.
2463000	2470000	I feel like, uh, uh, Borderlands 2 is like all of a sudden back again cause like I've seen more and more people streaming it.
2470000	2475000	Like our buddy Travis Donovan is trying to get more and more involved in Twitch. So shout out for his channel.
2475000	2480000	But he's been playing some Borderlands 2 and I'm kind of like, well this is a throwback. I haven't seen this game in a while.
2480000	2483000	Cause that game came out a while ago at this point, Borderlands 2.
2483000	2486000	Yes, it's been out for a long time, but it's a great game.
2486000	2490000	Yeah, no, it is. It'll be interesting to try it again in VR, I think. Play it all over again.
2490000	2497000	So, uh, let's see. Dungeon buster and chat says they're working on it, but I'm guessing they don't have anything to show for Borderlands 3.
2497000	2503000	So it just wasn't ready to go yet. Maybe next year or maybe they're going to sit on it for the next consoles. Who knows?
2503000	2513000	Cause now that's a question we have to start asking. Or no, no, Borderlands 3 will come out on this round of consoles and then they'll have the definitive edition on the new consoles.
2514000	2523000	Wait, oh god. Borderlands Battle Royale? How dare you. Don't even plant that idea in their heads. Alright.
2525000	2531000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, butter.
2531000	2537000	Well, um, you know, hey, for Battle Royale games, cross platform is all the rage, right?
2537000	2544000	So, uh, you know, one question we asked when we heard that Fortnite was going to go cross platform was how long until the other games go cross platform?
2544000	2551000	And Blizzard, uh, was one company that we were all looking at for Diablo, you know, and Diablo is going to be coming out on the Switch.
2551000	2556000	Well, interesting, there's been a little bit of back and forth on this this week.
2556000	2571000	So apparently there was a rep that actually was being interviewed talking a little bit about cross play in Diablo 3 who responded that it's not a question of when, sorry, it's a question of when, not if.
2571000	2583000	Basically leading us to go like, oh shit, they're going to put cross play in Diablo 3 so that would be great cause you can play the Switch and the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One and who knows, maybe there'd be a way to kind of link to PC.
2583000	2595000	And I thought, I kind of thought this was really exciting news as well, or this statement was very exciting because this may mean that, okay, well if it's cross play, then it may not necessarily go through Nintendo servers and whatever.
2595000	2604000	It's going to go through battle net. So maybe, I mean, think of it this way, you could chat with somebody playing World of Warcraft from your Nintendo Switch when you're in Diablo, right?
2604000	2614000	That would make sense how that might work, right? Well, unfortunately, that was the news a couple days ago, but Blizzard came out after that and said, I don't think so.
2614000	2628000	So there's a second comment from a Blizzard rep that said, while we love the idea of bringing our players together across platforms, we do not have any plans to implement cross platform gameplay for Diablo at this time.
2628000	2639000	Now, some are reading into this a bit, is that maybe Blizzard doesn't want to commit to this. They don't want to say it's going to happen because they haven't been testing it, they haven't been doing anything in Nintendo, they don't want to let anybody down.
2639000	2650000	Or, if they want to unveil this, they're going to wait for Blizzcon to do it. So there's still some wishful thinking going into this statement. Is that kind of one of those, well they didn't say not ever, just that they're not announcing it right now.
2650000	2652000	But, who knows.
2652000	2654000	Here's what they're waiting to see.
2654000	2662000	Don't expect it out the gate. Do not buy Diablo 3 on Switch expecting that it'll be cross platform. That is something that's very important.
2662000	2673000	Now, speaking of companies and cross platform, I think this is a good chance to say something about another company that does a lot of publishing on all these different systems, and that would be Bethesda.
2673000	2693000	So Bethesda is looking at doing more cross play. In fact, in a quote, they were doing an interview with Eurogamer, and part of what they said during this Eurogamer was, I'm trying to look at where the specific quote is here, because they actually talked about how cross play would be a really good thing.
2694000	2704000	He says here, I'm most heartened by Sony's news last week about cross play, because it seems they're going to open up and embrace not just cross play, but cross platform progression. Those are two very different things.
2704000	2714000	I don't want to just be able to play against people on other platforms, I want to be able to take my progress with me from device to device. What I've unlocked my character can do, I want to go from platform to platform.
2714000	2728000	And both those things I think are equally important, and I'm very much hopeful that with the next gen platforms, we'll see even more of that in terms of treating our fan base as a whole, as opposed to here's the Xbox folks, here's the PS4 folks, here's the Switch folks and PC.
2728000	2738000	Everybody's segmented and walled off from each other. We can just say you're all playing game X, and we can treat you all the same because your experiences are the same. You're playing against each other.
2738000	2750000	We already know Bethesda's head is kind of in this a little bit. They're not going to do it with Fallout 76, because it's one of those that was already in the planning stages and kind of done before cross play started going everywhere.
2750000	2759000	But we know for their Elder Scrolls game, they flat out came out and said, what's the new one called, the mobile one, but I say mobile, but it's going to be everywhere. It's going to be on Switch, PS4.
2759000	2761000	The Elder Scrolls Blades?
2761000	2770000	Yeah, that's it, Blades. So they come out and said, if you don't support cross platform, you're not getting Blades. So Bethesda kind of put their foot down on this whole thing.
2770000	2774000	So they really want, and you know, as somebody, Bethesda being a third party publisher.
2774000	2779000	They should also push for better mods in the PlayStation 4 version of Skyrim, but you know.
2779000	2781000	Might be a little late for that now. I think they're looking ahead.
2781000	2782000	It's never too late.
2782000	2791000	Bethesda was self-parry-ing themselves this year when it came to how many fucking versions of Skyrim there are.
2791000	2799000	I don't think Bethesda's interested in going back and visiting any more Skyrim. I think any talk here on out is going to be Blades, and then eventually Elder Scrolls 6.
2799000	2802000	But I would say Elder Scrolls 6 is still quite a ways out.
2802000	2806000	There's always room for Oblivion remasters.
2807000	2810000	Boy oh boy. Alright, anyway.
2810000	2817000	So it sounds like Bethesda really wants this, and I think, you know, as we get into more and more consoles, that may be very well the way it goes.
2817000	2820000	Especially if the third parties are putting on a lot of pressure to do that.
2820000	2823000	And then what else is it going to say with all that?
2823000	2833000	Is that they're putting a lot of pressure on it, and then, oh, with Forza, I've been playing that, you know, on both Xbox One and PC.
2833000	2836000	And when they talk about the portability, that is really nice.
2836000	2844000	It is nice. I can do one thing on my PC, and then when it's like, oh, I want to show my friend, so let's play on Xbox One for a little bit, it just, like, picks right up where I left off, essentially.
2844000	2850000	I mean, in Forza, you kind of start over at your house, but it's the same thing.
2850000	2854000	You can restart from where your progress is. Yeah, I need to play more of that, too.
2855000	2859000	Anyway, there you go. Cross platform and what the future might hold for that.
2859000	2866000	It sounds like third parties are putting a little more pressure on for this to stay the norm, especially going into the next generation of consoles.
2866000	2870000	But maybe don't expect it for all your games coming out this year.
2870000	2872000	Anyhow, moving on, Loki.
2872000	2879000	Yes, so apparently some PlayStation 4 users are claiming that they're receiving messages that are locking up their consoles.
2879000	2893000	So what they're receiving is basically some user message that can't really be displayed, and then what happens is their controllers and sound output fail, and then basically the console continues with error loops.
2893000	2896000	So what can you do to possibly stop this?
2896000	2899000	Well, there's a few things you can do to kind of prevent the message if you haven't gotten it already.
2899000	2906000	You can basically lock down your privacy settings to only allow friends only or no one to send you messages.
2906000	2920000	And then if you do happen to run across the message, the other thing you can do is download the PlayStation mobile app, delete it through the app, and then you can also rebuild your database on the PlayStation to fix the error.
2920000	2925000	So that's kind of annoying. Hopefully it's something that they address and will patch out.
2925000	2932000	And most likely it sounds like some sort of characters that can't be displayed or something and the console gets confused.
2933000	2935000	I don't know. That's stupid.
2938000	2943000	Well, I don't like, too, that there's a lot of clickbait going around about how this is bricking consoles.
2943000	2944000	It's locking up.
2944000	2954000	Yeah, it was brought up on Discord, and I think there was some feedback on Discord like, that headline is really misleading, because if it was bricking your console, you would not be able to use said console ever again.
2954000	2965000	This is more like just a fucking giant inconvenience, which isn't cool, don't get me wrong, but if this happens to your PlayStation 4, don't throw it in the dumpster. It's fixable. It's just really inconvenient.
2965000	2970000	And honestly, by the time the workday starts on Monday, I'm pretty sure Sony is well aware of this.
2970000	2977000	I mean, it just came up with a weekend, so I'm pretty sure you're going to see a patch rolling out probably this week that's going to fix this right up.
2977000	2989000	But I think it's a good reminder for everybody to check your privacy settings, and honestly, unless you have a reason for the public to be sending you messages, turn it off. Have it be your friends only.
2989000	3000000	I think mine's set to friends only. It might be set to friends of friends, if that's an option, because sometimes I want people to be able to add me if they see we have mutual friends, and they're like, oh, I know that guy.
3000000	3012000	But yeah, it's kind of on lockdown for the general public. And luckily, I have the mobile app. I tend to look at my messages on the mobile app first. So if I got anything funky like this, I'd probably delete it before I ever saw it on my PS4.
3012000	3023000	Yeah. And with how often I use my PlayStation 4, except for last night when I had to watch the DVD version of A Star is Born from 1970.
3023000	3029000	Aside from that, I hardly ever get to play my PlayStation 4 anyway, so yeah.
3029000	3044000	So yeah, you know where I get a ton of messages. So this is going to be a big throwback. So if you were here, the night that Orange Lounge Radio, the very last night of Orange Lounge Radio, the DDR show before we merged with the podcast.
3044000	3054000	You remember how we used to do it split? We did like an hour long podcast with the live show. It was a split show. Not all of you may know that. If you're new to Orange Lounge Radio, you may not realize there used to be a live only show that was not podcast at all.
3054000	3064000	And that obviously changed a long time ago. But anyway, I'm bringing that up because if you were here for that very last show, we had a guest named Mistress Tia on that show, who's one of my longest and dearest friends. She's wonderful.
3064000	3078000	She lives in New York City now. Well, this is how long ago that was. Her kid's like 13 or 14 now. And so I get all of these messages on PlayStation because the kid spams the entire friends list talking about fucking Fortnite.
3079000	3093000	And it's all these things. It's like, I didn't ask this, but it's her PlayStation out. So of course we friended each other, but it's her kid obviously monopolizes the PlayStation using her account, sending all these messages about how he's going to kick some dude's ass at Fortnite.
3093000	3103000	And I'm just kind of laughing. Like it's, I have a good time. I'm not like actually annoyed with it, but I'm just kind of like, Oh my God, stop. Get the kid his own account.
3104000	3113000	I know I didn't make her show roll, but there was one thing, you know, with the whole Call of Duty Black Ops 4 being now through the Blizzard launcher or whatever. Yeah.
3113000	3121000	Yeah. I guess what happens when you chat in Call of Duty on PC? Your real name shows up. Fun times.
3121000	3131000	So I went on a little bit of a Twitter rant because that's what we do now in 2018. We Twitter rant because this goes back to Blizzard's shitty implementation of Real ID.
3131000	3143000	And I realized Blizzard has done a lot of great things for PC games. Blizzard has a very diehard community, but even some of the most diehard Blizzard people, like I would die on Blizzard's hill.
3143000	3153000	Even some of them that I've met through the years that I did a Horde house, the Warcraft show years ago, even many of them that I've met think Real ID is implemented shittily.
3153000	3161000	And when I say shittily, I mean, and I might be making up a word there, but it's a word now. Shittily. It's how Real ID was implemented.
3162000	3177000	Is that on the Wiki? Shitty implementation. Shittily. Anyway, I say that because it's like Blizzard goes out of their way to make sure you're using your real name on all this stuff.
3177000	3190000	When, you know what, that might not be such a good idea. I realized they did that because they thought they would prevent toxicity, but clearly you're not paying attention to Overwatch if you think this is going to work.
3190000	3202000	I don't understand why putting your real name on blast in this day and age of everybody streaming, which Blizzard themselves endorses you streaming through Facebook.
3202000	3211000	Remember, they have a partnership with Facebook. It's right there in the Battle.net app. You can stream right there on Facebook. It defaults to showing your real name.
3212000	3222000	And in this day and age of streaming, like, is that such a good idea? And you might go, well Rob, if you don't want to put it out there, don't fucking stream.
3222000	3232000	Yeah. Problem with your little snap analysis is that if one of my friends is streaming, I can't do anything about it.
3232000	3240000	Because the default is to always show your friends real names. So if I send a friend a message who happens to be streaming, oh, I just showed my real name.
3240000	3250000	And one I didn't get to pick, one that Blizzard took off of my credit card I was using to pay for World of Warcraft without my permission and permanently put it on my account.
3250000	3257000	And I can't change it without some fucking court order or something like that. Like this is still a big problem with Blizzard.
3257000	3267000	And one that I really wish, because Blizzard is pretty decent about listening to their fan base when they make a stink, I wish there was more of a stink about this issue because it sucks.
3267000	3274000	Especially for those of us that for protection and, you know, things that have happened to us in the past don't always like to use their birth names.
3274000	3285000	So I really wish Blizzard, all they have to do, look, if they want to make you accountable or whatever by having your real name, fine, have it on a mouseover.
3285000	3291000	Have it on view profile. Like if you're like, Sky, who's Sky? Oh, right click view profile. Oh, it's Rob. Oh, that's who that is.
3291000	3299000	Fine, do it that way. But don't have it be like the name that just shows up in chat with the message. It sucks.
3299000	3304000	So I just wish Blizzard people would make more of a stink about that because Blizzard might actually listen.
3304000	3309000	But I just feel like people either feel like A, there's nothing that can be done. We've already had this real ID debate a long time ago.
3309000	3317000	Or B, it's just not a big enough issue for some people, whatever. And for a lot of people it isn't a big deal. They use their real name everywhere.
3317000	3323000	But maybe this call of duty thing and how big that news is, maybe that'll spawn a discussion. I don't know.
3323000	3331000	But I just would, again, all I want, I want the Blizzard ID to just default to the nicknames and show real name on request or something if you want to do it that way.
3331000	3335000	Fine. I'll compromise. Anyway.
3335000	3344000	Looking at chat over at live.voggenover.com. Oh, they're still talking about the PS4 spam. Not a lot of feedback to my rant there, but they're talking about the Fortnite spam.
3344000	3348000	Kaijuda is saying, I got spam messages on PlayStation 4 a few times. I've been meaning to turn off messages.
3348000	3353000	Well, the story about the brick consoles, even I said it. It's not really bricked. Not really bricked.
3353000	3357000	Asterisked consoles is a good opportunity to remind yourself about that.
3357000	3362000	Fifth Dream says, happens to me too. Some random dude I friended early on sends messages to 70 people.
3362000	3369000	Tigercall on chat says, PSN does this thing that would show your IRL name next to your PSN username.
3369000	3374000	So I just put in Tiger as the first name and Claws the last name. I got around that too on PSN.
3374000	3381000	I think it's because I linked it to my Facebook, which is not my real name, or PlayStation lets you fill it in.
3381000	3386000	Like, you don't have to fucking call Sony to be like, I need to change my real name. I'm pretty sure.
3386000	3393000	Maybe somebody in chat can correct me if I'm wrong. You can change it yourself by going in there and just changing your name.
3393000	3398000	Blizzard does not let you change your name without, like, calling and jumping through hoops.
3398000	3406000	This has gotten them some shit with transgender individuals who, you know, go through a process of changing their name and so forth.
3406000	3420000	But I believe, to be fair to Blizzard, under some type of heat and feedback, they reduce the requirements to change that sort of information to make that process easier for those folks going through that.
3420000	3431000	Anyhow. Yeah, BobbyBlackWolf in chat says, I never linked anything to my Battle.net account either, so they actually still believe my name is BobbyBlackWolf.
3431000	3436000	Yeah, they took my info off my credit card. That's what pisses me off. That's how they got my real name.
3436000	3444000	So I'm just, I'm really... Anyway. Alright. Let's move on and talk a little bit about other ways to lock things down.
3444000	3448000	But this time, a little more literally, how do you lock things down?
3448000	3459000	It's a new item called the Switch Safe. It locks the Switch to the dock and prevents the game card slot from being used, and it has a little lock on it.
3459000	3467000	So it's basically a dock for your dock that you can put the Nintendo Switch in and you can lock it away.
3467000	3473000	Maybe if you're afraid it's gonna get stolen or something like that. I don't know. But what I think it's really for is for families with kids.
3473000	3481000	And you know how you might tell the kids, now you don't get to play Nintendo Switch until all your homework is done, and I better not see what...
3481000	3488000	This is a way that you can make sure you're literally putting it under lock and key so that the kid can't play the Switch until they've done all their homework.
3488000	3495000	So that is a, that's a new little item there that you can get for sale, the actual Switch Safe. Would you get one of these for your house, Loki?
3495000	3496000	No.
3496000	3498000	Keep your kids away?
3498000	3506000	By the way, this is not the first time there's been something like this. Do you remember this for the NES? And Dartetsuya posted this in our story forms.
3506000	3507000	Yes, I remember that.
3507000	3520000	He's like, it reminds me of this. It looked like this little bar you put on your original Nintendo Entertainment System that would like hold the lid up and prevent games from going in. It was the master lock.
3520000	3521000	It's the club.
3521000	3529000	It basically is, it's the club. You guys remember that too for your car, for your car from getting stolen, you put the club on the street. It's basically that but for your Nintendo Entertainment System.
3529000	3536000	So it kind of is a throwback to that in a way. So it's interesting how all these parental controls have evolved over the years.
3536000	3545000	But also, it's interesting because doesn't Nintendo Switch kind of like have parental controls and they're pretty transparent in how to use them?
3545000	3552000	And if you want to see what your kid is playing and when, if you just educate yourself on it a little bit, it's really easy to find that information out.
3552000	3553000	Totally easy.
3553000	3558000	But most people don't know how to do it. So they're like, I'm just going to pick up this lock and key.
3558000	3561000	Ignorance is cash.
3561000	3572000	I think that is a good way to sum it up. Ignorance is cash. TigerConChat says, do people still use the club? I think if you drive a car from that era still, which some people do, you might.
3572000	3574000	Probably not because they're really easy to break through.
3574000	3582000	Oh, are they? See, now a lot of cars are all about like, I know my car uses a fob. So you don't even have a key anymore.
3582000	3584000	You can still spoof those, I think.
3584000	3591000	I was going to say, there's got, but certainly like, okay, you know how like your garage door opener runs on like a wireless signal?
3591000	3596000	So you can, you can change the code on your garage door to basically make it run on a different signal.
3596000	3600000	So like somebody can't just drive around the neighborhood holding down the garage door button and hope to open your garage, right?
3600000	3605000	You can change the code to something unique to prevent that. I would imagine like fobs are kind of like that too.
3605000	3610000	Or, I mean, there's so like, there's got to be a unique key in them that's 120.
3610000	3618000	Well, yeah. And I think originally garage door openers were infrared and they're a little bit more limited, but I think nowadays probably that probably just wireless.
3618000	3624000	And yeah, it's a little bit more, I don't know, higher tech.
3624000	3631000	SHO 100 Matt in chat over at live.voguenetwork.com says, I still see a ton of people using the club on older cars.
3631000	3638000	So, you know, for the good old cars that still run on ignition keys and things like that, of which there's, I mean, heck, my 2010 Civic ran on a key still.
3638000	3642000	So technically I, well, that's Alan's car now. He could use the club.
3642000	3646000	I have a 2017 car, but mine has the chip in the key though. So.
3646000	3653000	Oh, you know what? I think my Honda did too. I think that you're right. I think there was still like a chip in the key and it wouldn't work without it.
3653000	3659000	So you're right. All right. Anyway, uh, let's move on a couple more new stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.
3659000	3663000	Uh, next up a game you and I played a lot of exciting stuff.
3663000	3670000	It's Pokemon Go. And it's only a matter of time because they've already teased it. There's new Pokemon coming.
3670000	3678000	But when, when you might say, I think probably in the next few weeks, maybe right after a Halloween update, maybe. I don't know.
3678000	3683000	But gen four is coming and along with that, some rebalancing to the game as well.
3683000	3691000	So they're going to be doing some rebalancing to the battle mechanic, including adjusting CP values, um, to improve balance.
3691000	3695000	HP values. Thank God. Fucking Blissey.
3695000	3700000	No, my gym queen. No, she needs a nerf. It's fine.
3701000	3706000	Um, so they're going to adjust that to close the gap between high HP Pokemon and low HP Pokemon.
3706000	3717000	Pokemon defense and stamina values will be retroactively rebalanced, allowing higher defense Pokemon to be valuable in battle by outlasting opponents rather than simply running back the clock.
3717000	3723000	Uh, defensive values have also been slightly retroactively reduced for most Pokemon changes.
3723000	3729000	Um, or changes like this will help narrow the gap between Pokemon with the highest defensive stats and other Pokemon.
3729000	3737000	And then they're saying the other migration changes, um, adjustments to the weather and moving forward will have a reduced effect on the rate at which Pokemon spawn.
3737000	3740000	Is that like bad weather? Because that's even worse.
3740000	3748000	Um, no, I think it's that like, you know, um, how some climates just don't ever get rain like here or snow.
3748000	3753000	So it's basically those, I mean, I think it sounds like they'll still enhance some of the spawns, but it's not going to be like dependent.
3754000	3760000	Oh yeah. It's not going to be like where I look at it now and like 30 of the Pokemon in there nearby are enhanced by the weather type thing.
3760000	3764000	Yeah, it's going to be, it'll still be there, but not to the extent you see it now.
3764000	3771000	Um, apparently they said as you explore a given area, you'll notice that a greater variety of Pokemon will appear over time in different rates. Cool.
3771000	3780000	That is very good. Well, cause I'm wondering like with gen four hitting, that's a lot of, like, especially if you're new to the game, you're going to be overwhelmed with all the fucking Pokemon that are out there.
3780000	3784000	So, I mean, there's gotta be a way to kind of distribute the Pokemon in different ways.
3784000	3790000	Certain areas such as parks and nature reserves are now going to contain a more variety, um, variety of Pokemon species.
3790000	3797000	And that's going to be one way to do it. They're going to probably limit some types of spawns to parks. So that'd be interesting.
3797000	3807000	I'm, I'm down for a variety, especially after this psychic week and whatever, like they had, was it the day of female Pokemon, which I was like, Ooh, I got my love disc cause I didn't have that yet.
3807000	3811000	Oh, wow. You didn't have a love disc. Yeah, but everything else is like, eh, I don't need that.
3811000	3815000	Well, they also did shiny, uh, needle, needle queen and evolution.
3815000	3822000	I didn't get any of those. Yeah, no, I didn't either. I did get a shiny drowsy though. Just randomly from the psychic event going on. So that's kind of cool.
3822000	3828000	It's more and more shinies that are out there now. So yeah. You know, and coming up this Sunday is a Bedlam. Yes. Day. Yes.
3828000	3841000	So gen four, when, um, I believe if you follow some of the like Reddits and stuff that really get into the nitty gritty of this, Android got a limited release of the version of the game that is basically has the gen four Pokemon in it.
3841000	3848000	It has to be enabled server side still. So, and they do that. So that way, like Android and iPhone are not getting them at separate times.
3848000	3855000	And then at some point they'll force an upgrade. So you're going to have to download the latest version. That's when you know, the gen four Pokemon are here, uh, with the psychic event ending Monday.
3855000	3867000	Honestly, I think gen four is hitting next week. Um, well at least let me dial that back a little bit. The rebalancing will hit next week. I think, I think that might come first and then gen four, like really soon.
3867000	3873000	I thought they would do like on a Halloween event or something like that where it's like ghost Pokemon or something. They might, they might just unleash them all.
3873000	3885000	I mean, because so much of gen four is evolutions and pre evolutions, like with ride on and, and that whole thing with them getting, uh, it was like the mega evolutions now.
3885000	3896000	No, no, they're not mega evolutions. They're just like, they get new forms. So like electabuzz has a new form. Uh, so there's Rhyhorn, Rhydon, and that's why some of the rebalancing has to happen.
3896000	3908000	Like Rhydon is like one of the most, like I might be switching them around. Sorry. But that rhinoceros dude, he's like one of your best like Raiders and like if he's getting another form, that thing is going to be overpowered as fuck.
3908000	3919000	So they have to dial it back a little bit. So that's what I'm waiting for. My Merkrow to update. I've got so much candy. It's like you're a fucking useless piece of shit, but I'm going to keep you because, uh, mammal swine is going to be new.
3919000	3933000	That's, you know, a big one for the, that, that, uh, line. So yeah, I, so that, that's why I kind of think they can't do just the ghosts first because there's going to be so much gen four that it revolves on evolution and stuff.
3933000	3948000	So we'll see what happens. Uh, looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Uh, let's see. Bobby says, if there's one thing that I've learned from the gaming community, it's that just because something makes a lot of money doesn't mean it isn't failing.
3949000	3960000	Uh, let's see. Yeah, there's still, there's still a lot of money. Act F points out dead gay cause they're joking about the dead game thing. I know Bobby's not serious because I still send him gifts and Pokemon go and he opens them.
3960000	3972000	So act F says black Wolf, a dead game that made over $84 million only in September. Oh yeah. Well, cause people were buying incubators like mad to get their fucking mime and a Kangaskhan. Guilty.
3972000	3982000	I got a mime, but I don't remember where I got that from. I got it from some, I think it must've hatched it. One of the eggs, probably one of the Alolan eggs finally gave you one. So there you go. Let me get me now. Nothing.
3982000	3994000	Uh, Alolan eggs, Alolan eggs are just kind of generic right now, but I would assume when gen four hits, there's going to be something in them you're going to want. I know they're going to do it when gen four hits.
3994000	4005000	They're going to be like, Oh, such and such things are only, I was an idiot. So I had that whole Evie like that for the celiby thing. I've had the Evie thing where you have to walk an Evie for 10 kilometers and then evolve it. Oh right.
4005000	4017000	I walked it for 10 kilometers, switched it with something else and forgot to evolve it. Like, no, damn you. You have to, it has a big common mistake people make. You have to evolve it while it's your buddy.
4018000	4026000	Do not drop it out of your inventory. You can put it back as your buddy and I think you're okay because I think it still has the walk, but you have to evolve it when it is your buddy.
4026000	4037000	Hmm. So if you're willing to sacrifice it or look it up on the internet first, I'm sure somebody has done it. Maybe somebody in our channels. Well, I did evolve it already and I think actually it's, it's yeah, it evolves into something else.
4037000	4048000	But, uh, let's see. Go into chat at live.vognetwork.com. Tigerclaw wants some Pokeballs. Sorry, Tigerclaw. I'm trying to send gifts, but, um, especially on like Sundays, I don't get out on Sundays.
4048000	4059000	So like no gifts go out at all on Sundays, but other days it just depends on what I'm doing. Like when I was in Reno, like I got so many fucking Poke stops while we were in Reno.
4059000	4069000	I think I sent a gift to every single person on my friends list. It's like 120 people. I sent a gift to every single person that didn't already have something sitting in their inventory.
4069000	4079000	Because I think you're, you're limited to sending a hundred gifts a day. There, I just sent you one. Oh, you sent Tigerclaw one? Yes, I sent him. Oh, what a nice guy. Nice guy, Loki. There you go.
4080000	4090000	So it just depends. But if I try to catch, like I sometimes like I don't get enough gifts out of the Poke stops and because I know I usually with my walks, I try to walk past as many of them as I can.
4090000	4103000	But you know, you sometimes you go with like a few spins that it's not that or what'll happen is like, yeah, I'll have my gotcha on and I forget. Oh yeah, I can only collect 10 gifts at a time and I forget to send them.
4103000	4113000	Yeah. Which happened yesterday. Yeah. And my big thing is I forget to open them. Like, I'll be like, Oh, before I go to bed, I'm going to open all my gifts to make sure I hit the max today.
4113000	4123000	And I usually go through and I'll open gifts first from people who I haven't had an interaction with yet for the day to get, you know, as much credit as I can with the leveling up of all the different friendships that I have.
4123000	4132000	But, um, yeah, then I'll forget. And then it would be like, oops, it's one 30 in the morning and it's now tomorrow. So whoops. Uh, I've done that so many times anyway.
4134000	4149000	Yeah. Which by the way, five more days. Yeah. We're going to hit BFF next week. Same thing with Jamie. So I hit, I hit BFF like four people next week, which will be nice because if I time it with the lucky eggs, which you better tell me when we hit it. Cause I can do a lucky egg.
4149000	4156000	If I, yeah, I just didn't like act after that too. He told me that we're going to hit it, but then like, I didn't have a lucky egg on me.
4156000	4168000	I've got like, I was like, I was like, okay, I'm gonna go buy one in his poop popped and like, Oh yeah, you have to do it right away. Like as soon as the game opens, go bring up your screen to do the inventory so it can't beat you to the pop up or whatever.
4168000	4181000	But yeah, if you can pop a lucky egg, uh, I will hit level 40 next week with those friendship increases. Um, if I'm able to lucky egg them all and I'm very excited because that means I'm going to be in the rare level 16 level 40 club.
4181000	4191000	There's a few, I'm actually in a chat for level 16 years. Players who haven't also played on go and there's a few, but not a lot. So it'll be pretty soon whenever Harry Potter, Harry Potter.
4192000	4204000	I got my eye on that whenever that starts. So we'll see. All right. Anyhow, uh, gen four, but we want to go coming soon. Also coming soon, but not that soon coming less soon in the way future.
4204000	4214000	The PlayStation four successor, which I mean, is it not going to be called the PlayStation five? Would you not call it the plate? I don't know. I guess somebody can do whatever the fuck they want.
4214000	4229000	And then again, you know, Microsoft, yeah. Xbox one, three 16 in an interview with the financial times. Uh, Kenny Shiro Yoshida, who's now the boss of Sony did say at this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next generation hardware.
4229000	4238000	Uh, and the financial times continued the early indications, uh, were that it might not be a major departure from the PS four and that the fundamental architecture will be similar.
4239000	4249000	So basically they're saying, yep, we're working on the PlayStation successor, which we already knew they were working on the PlayStation successor the day, the PS four hit shelves.
4249000	4257000	That's how long these things take. Especially, you know, if we're going to be talking full four K gaming on that, which is I imagine is what it's going to be on the next round of consoles.
4257000	4265000	Like you're going to have, you know, companies that are already working on it because it's going to take that time to develop those type of games.
4265000	4273000	So, um, yeah, I'm sure it's just a matter of when is it next year is going to be 2020. Who know? I would say probably at this point 2020.
4273000	4279000	I hope so. Yeah. Although Microsoft really kind of set the stage to unveil something next year.
4279000	4294000	Although I feel like that's shooting the Xbox one X in the foot a little bit, but we also know that Microsoft's plan is that whatever is their next console, you could still play the games for that console on the old systems.
4294000	4302000	But it's like the cell phones and we, we, I think we had to play their old games on our, their old console games on my system, my PC.
4302000	4307000	Oh, even with that, that too, as a lot of other games are out there, new console on my PC.
4307000	4313000	But you know what I mean? Like if they come out with, you know, halo 21 or whatever they're up to now. Oh no, it's halo infinite.
4313000	4317000	So if halo infinite comes out on the next console, it's still going to play on the old consoles as well.
4318000	4327000	But it's kind of like your cell phone is that, you know, Pokemon go doesn't run quite the same on an iPhone six as it does on an iPhone 10.
4327000	4337000	There's a little bit of a difference, right? Right. So that's kind of what you can expect with something like what will happen in Microsoft's future and perhaps PlayStations as well.
4337000	4348000	I would assume, although I could be very fucking incorrect in this, but I hope Sony doesn't fuck this up, that the PlayStation five will be built so that you can play a PlayStation four games on it.
4348000	4366000	I hope, I don't know you guys. Anyway, that is it for what is going on with the current and the new games, but I think we should take a moment to journey to gaming's past.
4366000	4375000	I will say though tonight, the segment for gaming's past is a little shorter than it has been previously because we had to catch Dark Sakura during a break during the day to day.
4375000	4380000	So for those of you that step away during the break and so forth, you won't have as much time tonight.
4380000	4385000	So anyway, with that being said, let's get in the time portal and visit the classic game of the week.
4386000	4394000	And so we take a step back through time and space and radio magic and Skype to welcome Dark Sakura to the show.
4394000	4395000	Hi Jamie, how are you doing?
4396000	4397000	I'm okay. How are you?
4398000	4404000	I'm doing well. I'd be better if you were here, but I understand, you know, circumstances are what they are.
4405000	4406000	Yep.
4406000	4410000	So you're actually calling us like while you're on break at your job right now, right?
4411000	4412000	Well, I'm on lunch. Yeah.
4412000	4419000	Yeah. That's dedication. So Dark Sakura is dedicated to bringing you the classic game every week here on the show.
4419000	4426000	So let's get to it Dark Sakura. What did you pick as folks should be going into their own gaming vaults and finding a game to play this week?
4426000	4428000	What did you pick for the classic game of the week?
4429000	4433000	We're time traveling to 1999 and picking Jumbo Safari.
4433000	4434000	I love this game.
4437000	4441000	So Jumbo Safari was released by Sega in 1999 and it was a NAOMI game.
4442000	4449000	Although this was one of the few NAOMI games that did not make it to the Dreamcast, which, you know, was the course of the system at the time.
4451000	4459000	It also was supposed to be one of the real life career series games along with Brave Firefighters and Emergency Call and Helix.
4461000	4470000	So the other thing with this one is that it did eventually get home versions on the Wii and the DS under the title Jumbo Safari Animal Rescue in 2009.
4471000	4482000	So in this particular game you use a steering wheel and a gear shift on the machine to drive in a jeep and then you shoot a lasso to select your animals or to catch animals.
4482000	4490000	It has one of four different players with their own vehicles. The Wii actually has the same arcade game but it uses the motion control.
4491000	4498000	Also with that too is that you've got some other little characters and vehicles and stuff like that in the story mode.
4498000	4506000	Where you go and roam around in the game and you can catch your animals that way and you gain experience points and become a full park ranger.
4506000	4508000	It's a little bit more RPG-ish.
4508000	4513000	And you can also interact with the animals in that game and treat their injuries and feed them.
4513000	4520000	And you have co-op mission mode and four player party games like foster tracing.
4521000	4524000	The DS version is kind of the same way.
4524000	4532000	So it really was just a very simple game though in the arcade. Catch animals, get points. Catch animals, get points.
4532000	4537000	And you get hyenas and cheetahs and all kinds of animals.
4537000	4540000	But that's really it. It's very simple.
4540000	4546000	The console versions are pretty fun but for me it's just whatever I found in the arcade.
4546000	4548000	I'm going to go lasso me a hyena.
4549000	4551000	And that's it. Jambo Safari.
4552000	4559000	Yeah, I remember seeing this game in arcades and it's like, either you've seen Jambo Safari in the arcades or you haven't.
4559000	4562000	It's a very unique kind of looking game in the arcades.
4562000	4566000	And definitely like, you know, oh I'm going to go, you know, rassle me a bear.
4566000	4568000	Although it's not really. It's more like Safari animals.
4568000	4571000	So yeah, like, you know, lions and tigers and ligers.
4571000	4573000	I'm going to catch a hippo.
4573000	4578000	Exactly, exactly. But it kind of reminds me of like Crazy Taxi but a safari.
4578000	4579000	Yeah.
4579000	4580000	I think that's a good way to put it.
4580000	4581000	Yeah, it really is along the same vein.
4581000	4582000	Yeah.
4582000	4588000	And I mean it's like, you see that rhino over there? I'm going to catch him.
4589000	4590000	Exactly.
4590000	4593000	I could have done a Pokemon game like that. Like Pokemon Snap Arcade.
4594000	4598000	I wish, I never did pick this up on the Wii and I kind of wish I had.
4599000	4605000	But yeah, I guess, I guess, you know, maybe it's one of those things that will come back someday either on the Switch or something like that.
4605000	4608000	You should tweet Sega immediately and demand Jambo Safari.
4610000	4612000	There's other games I'd rather see.
4614000	4620000	But it is fun. I mean, if they did that, it should be like called Let Safari!
4621000	4630000	Plus it's unique. I think that's one other thing that makes this like classic game of the week very suitable is that, you know, you can't think of a lot of games that are about like safari animals.
4630000	4633000	Well, maybe the PlayStation 3 classic Africa.
4633000	4634000	Africa.
4634000	4635000	Africa.
4635000	4636000	Yeah.
4636000	4641000	But this isn't that. This is, you know, a little more action packed and a little more arcade fun type of thing.
4642000	4643000	Exactly.
4643000	4644000	Exactly.
4644000	4647000	All right. Well, there it is. Short and sweet. But yeah, I know you're on break tonight.
4647000	4651000	So do you have any final thoughts for our listeners before we head back to the show?
4653000	4654000	I wish I was on the show right now.
4655000	4656000	Oh, we miss you. Come back.
4657000	4658000	What are you throwing?
4659000	4660000	What's that?
4660000	4662000	What are you throwing if you're missing?
4662000	4667000	I'm going to drive my Jambo Safari to the Jeep over there and I'm going to lasso you in.
4668000	4670000	Ah, no. It's just painful.
4670000	4675000	Yeah. Well, I would rather be doing the show, but I got to earn that money.
4676000	4678000	That's right. Make that money. All right. We'll see you next week.
4680000	4681000	All right. Bye.
4687000	4697000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with our 748th episode already in progress for this October the 14th of 2018.
4698000	4700000	Let's get back into some rapid fire news.
4701000	4704000	We will be opening up the Skype line a little later in our show at Orange Lounge Radio.
4705000	4706000	All one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.
4707000	4709000	Is Mr. Smoosh's, like, screaming coming through the mics?
4710000	4713000	He's very antsy. I'll go give him some kibble to try to shut him up.
4714000	4717000	So you might have to take the rapid fire news a little longer tonight, Loki.
4718000	4723000	All righty. Sounds good. Anyways, so hey, who likes Commodore 64 games?
4723000	4724000	Me!
4726000	4736000	Anyways, as part of the Internet Archive, they've recently added a Commodore 64 emulator, as of last month, actually.
4737000	4741000	And you can actually check out quite a few Commodore 64 games that are on there as well.
4742000	4747000	So in total, they've uploaded, I guess, 15,000 programs, including 9,000 games.
4748000	4755000	The Commodore 64 catalog has quite a bunch of classic games, including Donkey Kong, Ms. Pac-Man, Space Invaders, and whatnot.
4756000	4759000	And they have, like, curated, I guess, like a showcase.
4760000	4773000	So if you want to check out the Commodore 64 and the different games you can play, you can actually go to archive.org slash details slash softwarelibrary underscore c64 underscore showcase.
4773000	4781000	And you can check out, they have Bubble Bobble, Donkey Kong, Ghostbusters, Ms. Pac-Man, Blood Money, Defender, and Chucky Egg.
4782000	4794000	Huh. That's amazing. I was just reminiscing about Commodore 64 with a friend this week, so it actually kind of made me want to go play some more Commodore 64 games and maybe do some streaming or even maybe videos on demand.
4794000	4802000	Kind of like the, remember that project Let's Remember I did on YouTube for like a month? Maybe bring that back with some old Commodore 64 games because such good memories.
4803000	4804000	All that stuff, all those games are great.
4805000	4806000	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
4807000	4814000	So, yeah, check it out if you're interested. And actually, I think there might be more than that available to actually check out.
4815000	4819000	I just loaded up, yeah, here we go. Yeah, Ghosts and Goblins.
4819000	4838000	Yeah, pretty much I think the whole library is available, so if you actually go to archive.org slash details slash softwarelibrary underscore c64 underscore games, you can check out the full library, which is, they have 9,000 results almost, including like BurgerTime, Choplifter, The Last Ninja.
4839000	4842000	And you can browse through there and find everything that's playable.
4842000	4849000	Oh, B.C. Quest for Wheels. I thought it was B.C.'s Quest for Wheels. I remember playing that on the ColecoVision.
4850000	4856000	Yeah, I remember that game too. B.C. was a comic strip, if you didn't know. It's about cavemen and stuff. They had a computer game about it, yeah.
4857000	4858000	Yeah, I used to love that game.
4858000	4859000	Yeah, it's an awesome game.
4860000	4868000	Alright, and then other fun stuff. This kind of falls along the lines of one of my other interests, which is LEGO.
4869000	4878000	And Overwatch now has some new official LEGO sets that you can check out. The first one, of course, being the Omnic Bastion set.
4879000	4890000	For $25, you can purchase it via the Blizzard store, and also be on sale at BlizzCon. I may have to purchase this, because I like LEGOs.
4891000	4897000	You do like LEGOs, and Overwatch is pretty sweet. I know you're not a big Overwatch player, but the characters, the lore, all that stuff is really cool.
4898000	4900000	But they have minifigs coming too, so it's not just Bastion.
4901000	4902000	Yeah, yeah. I mean...
4903000	4904000	I'll have to get D.Va when that happens.
4904000	4911000	Yeah, I was going to say, Alan's super into Overwatch, but I think Trastian is one of his not-so-picked players.
4912000	4921000	So, I don't know if he'll want to get this, but if they come out with Symmetra, Lucio, Zarya, like one of the characters I know he really loves.
4922000	4928000	He's a really good Zarya, by the way. So, he kind of got me to play the more. I need to play more Overwatch.
4928000	4934000	They're doing that Halloween event right now, too, and everything, and they just reworked Torbjorn, and I played...
4935000	4942000	That was something I did do. I didn't talk about it, really, but I just went into the Torbjorn training mode, just to see how he played now.
4943000	4947000	Because I actually really liked Torbjorn before, so I was a little scared of the changes, but it's interesting.
4948000	4955000	They made it so you can kind of let you throw the turret, and it self-builds now, and then you shoot lava. It's different. I don't know how I feel yet.
4956000	4957000	I'll have to get in there and actually play it in some matches.
4958000	4960000	Do you play as the Hamster?
4961000	4967000	I have a Wrecking Ball. I've played as Wrecking Ball, but I can't really figure out how to play Wrecking Ball effectively.
4968000	4977000	But you know, Xtaphir, my old buddy from Hoard House, got a play of the game this week as Wrecking Ball, so I think he's kind of playing that character.
4978000	4986000	I love Wrecking Ball as a character. Well, I love Tracer as a character, but I can't fucking play her for shit in the game. I can't figure it out.
4986000	4997000	I'm more excited when these characters come over to Heroes of the Storm, because not all of them are in Heroes of the Storm, but somebody like Lucio in Heroes of the Storm plays just like he does in Overwatch, but it's just a different type of game.
4998000	5000000	So it's kind of a neat thing. I don't know. Anyway.
5001000	5008000	All right, moving on with some more rapid-fire news, although, you know what, it's kind of a short show so far, so it's probably going to be a shorter show tonight, so we can spend a little more time on rapid news.
5009000	5014000	Stardew Valley, which I know some of you are addicted to. You can get addicted all over again on mobile.
5014000	5022000	That's right. The publisher of the game, Chucklefish, said that for iOS it will be released on October 24th, and I'm assuming Android is coming soon after.
5023000	5028000	So for those of you that want to play Stardew Valley on the road, or anyone that somehow hasn't played it yet, you will soon have your opportunity.
5029000	5037000	Also, something you'll have the opportunity for is that Sony finally, officially, officially saying that you will be able to change your PlayStation ID.
5038000	5043000	That's right. It was announced this week starting in early 2019. You can change your old PlayStation Network ID.
5044000	5051000	Part of the news I wouldn't have expected is that the first change will be free. So everybody gets one new free name change, which is cool, I guess.
5052000	5060000	If you want to change it after that, $10 a pop, or only $5 if you're with PlayStation Plus. Beta testing is going to begin soon if you're part of the preview program.
5061000	5067000	However, this is interesting. Not all games will support the new ID.
5067000	5079000	So this must have really been some poor planning that Sony is paying for now, because apparently any PS4 game published after April 1st, 2018 will support it.
5080000	5089000	The rest? Not guaranteed. However, Sony does say a large majority of the most played PS4 games that were released before.
5089000	5098000	Which I would imagine would mean probably anything first party, but they're not going to be able to account for a lot of the third party stuff, especially if they didn't help them with it.
5099000	5105000	And I would imagine like maybe indie stuff may really have a problem as well. So just a heads up. That's so weird to me.
5106000	5109000	But it's just the way it worked behind the scenes. That's just how it happened.
5109000	5118000	They do also say, not all games applications for PS4, PS3, and Vita systems are guaranteed to support the online ID change.
5119000	5123000	Users may occasionally encounter issues or errors in certain games.
5124000	5131000	If you experience issues after changing your ID, you can revert back to the original for free at any time.
5132000	5135000	Reverting back to the old ID will resolve most issues caused by the name change.
5136000	5139000	So, in other words, don't change.
5140000	5142000	Never change. Change is bad.
5143000	5145000	If you play old stuff, don't change.
5145000	5157000	The thing about this though, I don't know. I kind of feel like people are making a bigger deal out of this than is necessary.
5158000	5164000	But, you know, it would be unfair of me to sit here and complain about real ID and not kind of point out the whole, this is a little silly too.
5165000	5168000	Because people do change their identities and so forth later on.
5168000	5174000	You know, people want to go, maybe the name they picked when they were 13 years old playing Fortnite isn't quite what they want when they're 21 years old.
5175000	5178000	You know, which PlayStation 3 and 4 and online has been around that long.
5179000	5184000	Where, you know, some folks that were 12 and 13 when this first rolled out are like in their 20s now and they want to change their damn name.
5185000	5194000	So I get it to that extent, but because of the way Sony's infrastructure was set up, you're not really changing your name, it sounds like, because the old name is like there forever.
5195000	5198000	It's just like there's some type of, we're just calling it something different for now.
5199000	5202000	Pretty much, pretty much. So yeah.
5203000	5209000	And Brad from Pod Culture points out Sky versus Rob Roberts on Twitter, you know, and that's in our chat room.
5210000	5214000	It's a fair call out, but I'm not going to change my PlayStation ID to Rob Roberts.
5215000	5221000	Like, I don't see the need. I'm fine with still being like Sky on consoles.
5221000	5228000	Well, here's the other thing, you know, here's the other reason I don't change because PlayStation 4 has all that Facebook integration now.
5229000	5235000	So like, even if many of you change your names, I'm never going to see it because I have your Facebook name in my friends list.
5236000	5241000	And that's actually kind of what I prefer. Isn't that funny? Because now I'm going back and saying, I like the real name thing.
5242000	5249000	But it's your Facebook name, you can change it whenever you want, you don't have to like call, you know, it's a lot easier to do.
5250000	5255000	It's also like, you have a choice, whereas, you know, it's kind of forced upon you otherwise.
5256000	5259000	Yeah. So I'm probably just not going to be changing my online username.
5260000	5264000	So, alright, let's travel around the world and check out what's coming out in stores this week.
5265000	5268000	Games that will support these changes because they're after April 1st.
5268000	5273000	Yes. So Big Buck Hunter Arcade for Nintendo Switch.
5274000	5282000	Crayola Scoot on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Apparently that's an extreme sports game, whatever the fuck that's supposed to be.
5283000	5288000	Lego DC Super Villains on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5289000	5294000	NBA 2K Playgrounds 2 on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5294000	5297000	Rapala Fishing Pro Series on the Switch.
5298000	5307000	Starlink, or Star Fox, but still Starlink, Battle for Atlas on the Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5308000	5314000	Warriors Orochi 4 on PlayStation 4, the Switch, PC, and Xbox One.
5315000	5323000	Let's try to pronounce this one. I think it's DICE, RA, Amantas, Armentis.
5324000	5326000	It's a visual novel game. It's on the Switch.
5327000	5337000	Moto Racer 4 on the Switch, Siberia 3 on the Switch, and let's see, Sinner, Sakura Fice for Redemption.
5338000	5340000	That's a weird way to spell that.
5340000	5344000	That's on the Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5345000	5352000	Dark Souls Remastered on the Switch, and last but not least, Soul Calibur 4 on...
5353000	5354000	6.
5354000	5359000	6, whatever. 4, 6. It's all the same. It's not going to have Yoda in this one?
5360000	5363000	No, it's not. It's going to have the Witcher guy, Geralt.
5364000	5365000	Close enough. That's like Yoda, right?
5365000	5366000	Close enough.
5367000	5369000	Soul Calibur 6 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5370000	5374000	By the way, Siya Tabiri would like you to know it's pronounced Diaz-E-Ray.
5375000	5376000	There you go.
5377000	5383000	Traveling to Japan. Probably the big release over there on the PlayStation 4 this week is Soul Calibur 6 on October 18th.
5384000	5386000	I know I am really looking forward to that. That's a fighting series that I enjoy.
5387000	5391000	So to celebrate Soul Calibur 6, you can also get a special arcade stick that's going to be coming out as well.
5391000	5396000	And I believe they may... No, they do not have a special PlayStation. There's just other types of...
5397000	5398000	There's like third-party joysticks you can get, too.
5399000	5402000	I'm surprised there's not a special PlayStation 4 to celebrate it, but it looks like they don't have that.
5403000	5406000	If Soul Calibur isn't up your alley, then you can look forward to Crystar.
5407000	5411000	It's another big game that's coming out in Japan this week. Both those games on the 18th.
5412000	5414000	That's really it for the PlayStation 4. I imagine Soul Calibur is kind of a big deal.
5415000	5420000	But over on the Nintendo Switch, you have Dark Souls Remastered getting its Japanese release this week.
5421000	5426000	There is that Dark Souls figure that comes with that. So your amiibo, for those of you still collecting amiibo.
5427000	5431000	Also, Crash Bandicoot Butobi San Dan Mori, which is of course the Crash Bandicoot collection.
5432000	5436000	That is coming out on the Switch over there as well. So that's what you have to look forward to.
5437000	5442000	DS Irae is also on the Nintendo Switch. That whole game is hitting Japan this week as well.
5443000	5446000	Without Dark Sakura, we have no one to do the UK dates. Maybe you could pick that up, Loki?
5447000	5449000	Or maybe Mr. Smoosh wants to scream it into the mic.
5449000	5451000	Yeah, he's very interested in doing that.
5452000	5455000	God, he's having a fit. Because his other dad's not here.
5456000	5460000	Well, in the UK you're getting Big Buck Hunter Arcade on the Switch.
5461000	5465000	Starlink Battle for Atlas on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch.
5466000	5470000	Dark Souls Remastered on the Switch. Warriors Orochi 4 on the Switch.
5471000	5472000	PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5472000	5479000	Siberia 3 on the Switch. Project High Rise Architects Edition on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch.
5480000	5485000	And, let's see, Soul Calibur 6 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5486000	5492000	And we have Crayola Scoot on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch.
5493000	5495000	Luigi's Mansion on 3DS.
5495000	5500000	And Lego DC Super Villains, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch.
5501000	5504000	Motor Racer 4 on the Switch.
5505000	5508000	And finally, Grave Danger on PlayStation 4 and the Switch.
5509000	5510000	Lots of Switch games.
5511000	5514000	So, the chat over at live.vognetwork.com is lighting up going,
5515000	5519000	Poor Mr. Smoosh, give him attention. Nobody loves him except for all his internet fans. Give him a mic.
5520000	5524000	Okay, first off, we love Mr. Smoosh. You know that. Shut up.
5525000	5531000	I could call him over here. He's not a dog. He's not gonna come over here. Cats do whatever the hell they want.
5532000	5535000	So, I wouldn't be able to get him over here on a mic even if I could. Oh, oh. Other dad just got home,
5536000	5540000	and so now Mr. Smoosh will be following him around like crazy. I just sent Alan a message going,
5541000	5542000	He's being a terror.
5543000	5545000	Okay, you guys. Alan's here, and he'll take care of Mr. Smoosh.
5546000	5551000	But sadly, no mic, because you can't make cats do anything, and you all know that.
5552000	5553000	You cat lovers know that. Cats do what they want.
5553000	5556000	You don't own the cat. The cat owns you.
5557000	5561000	Let's get to the email, because you guys own us with your thoughts and opinions.
5562000	5564000	Every week with your emails, if you want to send us emails,
5565000	5569000	participate at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send your emails,
5570000	5573000	and we read your emails here live on air.
5574000	5577000	We have two emails tonight, and the first one to us comes from YYR,
5577000	5583000	who's continuing on his DDR adventures and questions for you, Loki, from a previous episode.
5584000	5586000	So let's start. YYR starts us off tonight.
5587000	5592000	Hello, LR. Thanks as always for the show, for promoting my crude-looking games.
5593000	5596000	They're retro, YYR, and for reading and responding to these emails of mine.
5597000	5601000	In response to the in-depth discussion that was had last week regarding Loki's DDR progress,
5602000	5604000	or lack thereof, I'll make a few suggestions.
5604000	5608000	Loki, you can follow them or not based on how much you're looking to build your skills, if at all.
5609000	5612000	And you can find out by following Loki on Twitch at lokiolr.
5613000	5617000	We'll see what my skills are and how I stumble about, but I don't use the bar.
5618000	5620000	Maybe you'll have to start. Who knows?
5621000	5624000	YYR might be your first Twitch subscriber when you hit that affiliate status. Anyway.
5625000	5627000	YYR continues, in my typical two sessions per week,
5628000	5633000	I personally find it difficult to focus both on single and double skill building within the same session.
5634000	5637000	If I'm seriously looking to improve, I have to focus on one or the other.
5638000	5640000	I do try to switch between them regularly, though,
5641000	5645000	because I definitely find that skill building in one style does help the other, for me at least.
5646000	5650000	For example, I learned how to do crossovers properly in single by playing double.
5651000	5654000	It sounds to me like you do ultimately want to focus on double, which is fantastic,
5655000	5659000	but that you've hit a wall. My recommendation is that you focus a bit more on single at the moment
5659000	5665000	in an effort to practice foot speed and streams, with the goal being to break into the upper 8, lower 9 range,
5666000	5670000	because doubles charts have similar density and patterns to their single counterparts
5671000	5675000	that should help prepare you to break through the wall and eventually reach the same point on double.
5676000	5678000	Which, you know, if you aren't playing doubles, Loki, you're not going to use the bar anyway.
5679000	5680000	Well, I take that back.
5681000	5682000	Yeah, you say that, but I've seen that.
5683000	5684000	If your legs are big enough, you can do it.
5685000	5686000	My legs are not big enough. That's not an option.
5686000	5692000	Yeah. Some specific charts. YYR getting into the theory of all games. This is game theory.
5693000	5705000	Anyway, some specific charts to work on or work towards could include the heavy difficulties of B-Lovin', Dxy, Zenon, La Senorita Virtual, and Do You Remember Me?
5706000	5710000	So, for those that are not as well-versed in DDR, those are all songs in the game.
5711000	5714000	Also, I would encourage you to try the standard difficulties of the boss stages.
5714000	5718000	In other words, anything with Survivor or Max in the title except for Trip Machine Survivor.
5719000	5723000	These are much easier than the heavy versions, but retain the high speed so they make for great practice.
5724000	5728000	If any of this sounds unattainable, well, that's good because it will make it much more satisfying when you do nail it.
5729000	5734000	Just remember, everyone thought Max 300 looked impossible the first time they saw it, myself included.
5735000	5743000	But now, even as I'm turning 39 next month, one of my goals is to get a perfect, full combo on that very same Max 300 Expert Chart on DDR Ace.
5744000	5750000	I think the best way to improve at DDR is to set goals that seem like they're just a little bit out of reach, then work towards them as best you can.
5751000	5756000	Good luck! I'll end by expressing my disappointment at something that I believe was missing from last week's episode.
5757000	5765000	It is true that there were a few mentions, but I was looking for a full segment containing news and updates covering everything new in the world of Bowsette.
5766000	5770000	On the Orange Launch Radio website, the subtitle proclaims, news that gamers really want to know.
5770000	5777000	Well, I'm Gamer, and I want to know about the latest Bowsette innovations, cosplays, and especially dank memes.
5778000	5781000	So please implement this new segment starting next week.
5782000	5790000	Well, YYR, when it comes to Bowsette, all I have to say is that's fake news, and we don't talk about fake news that gamers really want to know about.
5791000	5795000	Thank you as always for listening to our feedback and implementing it into the show.
5796000	5798000	Have a great week, lots of love, YYR.
5798000	5806000	P.S. Yes, the ridiculous request for a Bowsette segment was made specifically so we could all hear Rob's reaction. You're welcome.
5807000	5811000	Fake news, fake reaction. Alright, moving on.
5812000	5819000	It's not that I hate Bowsette. Let's talk about this for a minute. Can we talk? Can we twawk? We're gonna twawk.
5820000	5824000	It's not that I hate Bowsette. I hate what you've all done with it.
5825000	5828000	There's a difference. There's a big difference.
5830000	5834000	Did you see, did you see the trailer for the Bowsette porn that hit the web this week, or maybe it was last week?
5835000	5836000	Which one?
5837000	5840000	Exactly. Exactly. Delete it.
5842000	5850000	Moving on. One more email tonight from Frodo Swagons, who sends us like a, it's like a Twitter sized email basically.
5850000	5861000	So Frodo Swagons sends us an email that says, Loki, you were just elected the president of Nintendo. What are your plans for Nintendo's future?
5862000	5869000	Frodo Swagons. That's it. That's the email. So I love it. Short and to the point. Frodo Swagons doesn't have time to fuck around here.
5870000	5877000	It also, actually P.S. sent from Yahoo Mail on Android. So they were on a mobile device when they did it.
5877000	5879000	No Yahoo Mail wasn't on Android yet.
5880000	5888000	Oh, now you know. The more you know. Anyway, so one more time. You were just elected the president of Nintendo because that's how presidents get put in place.
5889000	5890000	Elected by the board.
5891000	5892000	It really should be. I mean.
5893000	5895000	What are your plans for Nintendo's future? Congratulations on your promotion, Loki.
5896000	5897000	That's awesome.
5898000	5899000	What are you doing day one? What are we doing?
5900000	5902000	Day one? Well, first off, we're totally, totally announcing a new F-Zero game.
5903000	5904000	Good. Good.
5904000	5907000	And then number two, of course, we're announcing Waluigi for Smash.
5908000	5912000	Okay. I like where this is going. How about a cease and desist on Bowsette on the internet?
5913000	5914000	Oh, she's going in Smash.
5915000	5916000	Fuck off.
5918000	5919000	Why not?
5920000	5921000	Fine. Waluigi and Bowsette in Smash. Fine.
5922000	5929000	But no, if we really want to piss off the fans, you know, in Nintendo's side, what we'll do is we'll do our own version of Bowsette that's totally like just, you know, more Bowser than Bowsette.
5930000	5933000	You know, less Boobs, more dinosaur turtle thing.
5934000	5935000	Yeah.
5936000	5937000	So we can do that.
5939000	5940000	What else?
5941000	5943000	Mother 3. Got to localize that, of course.
5946000	5947000	Yeah, basically what everybody else wants.
5948000	5949000	Yeah.
5950000	5957000	It's kind of less than I would have thought. I thought you would have had this whole spiel and 10-point plan about what to do about online.
5959000	5962000	My lack of a plan for online is still better than their plan for online.
5962000	5967000	Hold yourself for this. Here we go. Because I got this question in chat at live.fognotor.com.
5968000	5974000	ActDeft in chat says, Rob Roberts, you get the Peachette crown and are elected new president of Nintendo. What do you do?
5975000	5980000	Alright, I'm going to do two things. Number one, I'm going to ban Bowsette from the internet.
5981000	5982000	Cease and desist all the websites.
5983000	5984000	But you have the Peachette crown.
5985000	5991000	That's my first step. Second step, I sell the company to Microsoft. Now online will finally be figured out.
5992000	5999000	Done. Mic drop. And that's it. I sell the company to Microsoft and give everybody what they've always wanted.
6000000	6008000	The super company that has, why didn't I sell it to Sony? Because a little more interesting competition. A little more interesting competition if I sell it to Microsoft.
6009000	6015000	Microsoft's having problems breaking into Japan. Microsoft can help out with the online. There's a little more of a help me help you situation there.
6016000	6017000	There it is.
6018000	6019000	President cat localized.
6019000	6023000	Yes. Yes. And then president cat localized on my way out the door.
6024000	6028000	And new F0 again. I guess I have more than two things I want to do. Alright.
6029000	6034000	Anyway, thank you for the emails. Participate at OrangeLawnTradio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week. Those are fun.
6035000	6038000	Let's get into some more news stories. Low keys.
6039000	6048000	Alright. So this is pretty awesome. So they've got this whole, basically you can get a different version of
6049000	6052000	The Legend of Zelda. Well, I wouldn't say it's a different version, but it's a
6053000	6061000	A tweet starting save for The Legend of Zelda. They call it The Legend of Zelda Life of Luxury.
6062000	6070000	Living the life of luxury. It's apparently a version of Zelda that you can get through the whole NES library on the Switch online app.
6070000	6074000	Which allows you to start off the original Legend of Zelda, which originally you start with nothing.
6075000	6079000	And you have to, you know, get a sword from a man and continue the game through that.
6080000	6090000	But you start off with a lot more stuff. So you start off with the white sword, a magical shield, blue ring, power bracelet, blue candle, and a red potion and a piece of meat.
6091000	6095000	Three extra heart containers as well as a ton of rupees, bombs, and keys.
6095000	6101000	It's like basically Bobby Black Wolf mode of The Legend of Zelda.
6102000	6107000	And you get to play the game that way. And then of course if you beat the game then you can get the second quest type thing.
6108000	6113000	Neat idea. I wonder if I can get my kids to play Zelda this way, but I don't know.
6114000	6122000	I mean, you know, I checked out the Switch online this week and it was cool to see the Solomon's Key and this dodgeball and whatever golf game they added that I don't plan on playing.
6122000	6126000	But, you know, the other two games are cool to see. And then, you know, it was kind of like this extra little bonus.
6127000	6131000	Like Zelda SP, obviously Twitter ruined it for me so I knew it was coming, but I thought that's kind of interesting.
6132000	6138000	What do you think? I mean, and basically all it is, it's like either a ROM save state or like a game genie-fied version.
6139000	6145000	Because what's interesting about it is that when you start it you completely bypass the title screen. Have you actually gone in to check it out?
6146000	6147000	It sounds like a save state.
6148000	6149000	Like a modified save state.
6149000	6155000	That's what it feels like. It feels like a modified save state. I mean, and I don't know how they did it, but seeing as Nintendo...
6156000	6160000	So what happens when you go to those dungeons with those things in there? Is that, it's just like...
6161000	6164000	I don't know. I haven't played that far into it yet, so I don't know if they're not there or what.
6165000	6171000	I'm thinking that's going to be my after show stream tonight as I'm going to play through that and kind of answer some of those questions about where do those items go?
6172000	6175000	What happens when you go to those places? So we'll take a look at that later tonight.
6175000	6181000	It doesn't give you everything because you don't get the magic sword and I think the bow is in one of those levels.
6182000	6190000	So I think it gives you everything you can buy from merchants, but I'm not sure it gives you the stuff in the levels. You might still have to play through the levels and all that stuff.
6191000	6196000	But it's still interesting that Nintendo is kind of padding the online library with this stuff.
6196000	6207000	I mean, okay, it's kind of a, I don't know, it's a bit of a throwaway, but it's not, it is something, Loki, where it's not just a straight up emulation of an old game, you know what I mean?
6208000	6211000	Like it's something like, oh, Nintendo did something different.
6212000	6219000	Let's give us some ROM hacks. We need some ROM hacks of like, you know, Mario games or Metroid or something. Is Metroid in there already?
6219000	6228000	I believe it's, it's on the, I think it's next month's big game is next month. Yeah. But who knows, you know, maybe Nintendo is planning to do this to pad the library.
6229000	6231000	I would go for an easy mode in Metroid. I'm down with that.
6232000	6236000	Yeah. Well, that's, that's why we had good old passcodes back in the day. Like Justin Bailey understood.
6237000	6238000	Yeah, that should still work.
6239000	6244000	Yeah. All those old passwords should still work. So, uh, if, if you have an old ass password from the NES days, they should still work.
6244000	6253000	I mean, the game's programming has not changed or any of that. So you could use a lot, but there's no reason. I mean, what, and again, it wouldn't take much effort on Nintendo's part.
6254000	6267000	Why not just like, if you start Metroid, have it go use save password for regular Metroid or for special Metroid, uh, that you play as Samus, like basically Justin Bailey or whatever, or you play as, um, you know what I mean?
6267000	6279000	Samus without the suit or that you start with like all the items and stuff like a super code that you can go right to mother brain or whatever. I mean, maybe that's a direction Nintendo's exploring that we see going on here with this, uh, Zelda hack.
6280000	6282000	I wish we get more NES remix stuff.
6283000	6290000	You know, what's funny is over in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, they're kind of talking about NES remix. Uh, let's see. What was the, oh yes.
6291000	6303000	Act Dev says, you know, with this, when are we getting NES remix for NES online? You never know. That could be something. Uh, Tigerclaw follows that up with the real question is when are we getting SNES remix? Never say never.
6304000	6315000	So, yeah, but I thought this was an interesting direction for Nintendo with the, you know, it's something different besides just the game and it's not much, but it's like, oh, that's a, that's an interesting thing that they did.
6316000	6319000	So I'll be curious to see if they do this with other games in the coming, in the coming weeks.
6320000	6326000	Now, um, so I joked earlier about how I would sell Nintendo to Microsoft. I wasn't being serious, you guys, just, just so we're clear.
6327000	6336000	Um, but, uh, Microsoft is certainly going to, uh, buy as many studios as they can to really get those first parties and give them an edge, uh, in the next generation of games.
6337000	6349000	And it sounds like this next one could be a doozy. Uh, Microsoft is finalizing a deal to acquire Obsidian Entertainment, uh, which, you know, Obsidian Entertainment made Pillars of Eternity II and they made some pretty big games.
6350000	6356000	Uh, apparently there's been some people briefed on negotiations and it leaked to the press, but, you know, we don't know if it's a done deal yet.
6357000	6362000	Uh, apparently one person said it's 90% finished, it's not a matter of when, it's if, and so on.
6363000	6369000	Some of the other big games that Obsidian's worked on, Knights of the Old Republic II, Fallout New Vegas, and of course Pillars of Eternity.
6369000	6376000	So, um, yeah, uh, of course Microsoft gave the good old, we do not comment on rumors or speculation when they were called out on it.
6377000	6383000	But, I mean, where there's smoke, there's fire, apparently there's three different sources cluing in that this is happening and this could be a pretty, pretty big deal.
6384000	6385000	Uh, what do you think?
6386000	6394000	I think it's, I mean, it's not unexpected because they've been purchasing a ton of different studios. I'd just like to see what's coming out of all these studio purchases.
6394000	6401000	Well, I don't think we'll know that for a little bit. You know, we won't really know until the next box, whenever that is, but it's interesting nonetheless.
6402000	6413000	Uh, I love Obsidian's response to this, by the way. Obsidian said, unfortunately we don't comment on rumors or speculation other than to say that the Rumors album by Fleetwood Max still holds up.
6414000	6416000	That was their official comment.
6417000	6418000	That's hilarious.
6419000	6429000	It's a bummer Lindsey Buckingham ain't touring with them and Fleetwood Max is just in the year 2018. They are just as much of a dramatic mess as they were back in the day.
6431000	6436000	This is what happens when you're in your 70s and you do a lot of drugs. Alright, let's move on. Loki.
6437000	6445000	Alright, so the Brazilian government is calling for the removal of some, um, violent far right games from Steam.
6445000	6458000	So they have, you know, right now there's been this whole thing on Steam where they just said, listen, we're not gonna really police anything unless it's, you know, straight up trolling, but we're just gonna let everything on to the service.
6459000	6463000	And because of that, now you're getting all sorts of, like, weird shit on there.
6463000	6483000	So there's this thing called, um, Bolsamido 2K18 where you play as, um, Bolsonaro and he punches and stomps on black LGBTQ and political rival protesters.
6484000	6487000	So you're beating up minorities and stuff like that.
6488000	6497000	And basically, you know, there's this whole thing in the beginning, defeat the communistic evils in this disrespectful game and be the hero that will free the nation from misery.
6499000	6503000	It just sounds like more trash that they've unloaded on Steam. More garbage.
6504000	6516000	But I think it's interesting that now the government is stepping in, basically telling Steam, like, I mean, not our government, but the Brazilian government is stepping in to basically tell Steam to fucking, like, clean up their shop. You know what I mean?
6517000	6523000	Basically because they're, you know, saying this can, like, incite violence or, you know, it's just that they're promoting this type of thing.
6524000	6526000	That Steam by selling it is promoting it.
6527000	6534000	Which, yeah, I mean, you can't really argue that they're not promoting this stuff because they're, you're allowing it on your marketplace.
6535000	6543000	It's essentially, as I've heard the descriptions, like, if you're allowing, like, people to bring in, like, feces and place it on your store shelves.
6543000	6546000	It's like you went to your favorite supermarket and people are just placing-
6547000	6548000	Wait, you don't see that at Walmart today?
6549000	6553000	You're placing just, like, straight up feces in a box, you know, on the store shelves.
6554000	6564000	And they're like, yeah, we're cool with that, you know, I mean, you can't be upset when someone says you can't put feces on your store shelves and sell it as food.
6565000	6566000	There's rules and laws against that.
6566000	6571000	We have, we have, it's gonna violate some health codes or something, so you can't do that, you know.
6572000	6577000	That's, that's basically what the Steam storefront is right now. It's just they're letting anything out with our-
6578000	6581000	Wait a second! Is that trolling? No, it's not trolling, it's feces. Oh, okay, that's-
6582000	6586000	Fifth Dream in chat says, feces are us. Why not?
6587000	6591000	And Sia Tabiri, of course, mentions, usually that's in a plastic bag and in the garden section.
6592000	6594000	But it's not being, well, it's being sold as pet food.
6594000	6600000	Gotcha, because Target got rid of all their garden sections. I think most Walmarts did too, right? I don't know, anyway, it doesn't matter.
6601000	6602000	New gardens nowadays.
6603000	6618000	The point is, it's about Steam, and the point is, is that, look, and I get a lot of people are like, we're becoming too politically correct in our society and people are so sensitive and all this stuff, but like, this is some shit that crosses a very obvious line.
6618000	6631000	Like, you know what I mean? Like, this isn't about, like, maybe a tasteless joke or something like that. This is about, like, beating up people that are like, correct me if I'm wrong, this is like beating up minorities and people, like, it's not cool.
6632000	6634000	Like, it's like violence and shit. It's not okay. Right?
6635000	6636000	Right.
6637000	6646000	That's what we're talking about in this game. So, and this is why the government of Brazil has stepped in and said, um, no, not in this country, you're not selling this. Which is what they're doing, they're selling that stuff, so.
6647000	6648000	On a side tangent.
6649000	6650000	Oh boy.
6651000	6652000	That I completely forgot in my gaming week.
6653000	6654000	Oh boy.
6655000	6656000	I checked out that Naked Fighter game. It is garbage.
6657000	6658000	Oh, from last week?
6659000	6675000	It is garbage, because it's basically, it's like a turn bait, so you create your stupid characters and you put them, like, against each other, and then you watch them fight, and it's the most boring fucking piece of, like, I seriously, like, sat there for a couple minutes, and the fight was still not over yet, and I'm like, this is boring.
6676000	6677000	I'm like, this is fucking dumb.
6678000	6679000	Only video games can make nudity boring.
6680000	6690000	Seriously, it's like, it's like, it made the, it's like, it's dumb. It's so boring at that point. The game is just garbage. Yeah, I get it, hahaha, it's naked people, but the game is garbage.
6691000	6699000	But isn't that, okay, that's, that's like, any mod, like a Skyrim mod that makes everybody naked, or Mario, I'm sure there's a Mario 64 mod that makes everybody naked and all that stuff.
6700000	6701000	Yeah, Bowser in there.
6702000	6707000	Anyway, but isn't one of those things where it's like, haha, they're naked, and then it's like, that's it. That's it.
6708000	6714000	But that never gets boring in Skyrim. Skyrim is a fun game, and adding the nudity on top of that is just the icing of the cake.
6715000	6724000	But when, when all your cake is just, it's icing, covering feces, you know, then you can't, it's not, that does not make a cake.
6727000	6728000	Moving on.
6729000	6730000	I've had it.
6731000	6738000	Dragon Quest on the 3DS, or lack thereof, because Dragon Quest XI didn't come out on the 3DS, and, here in this country.
6739000	6743000	A lot of us were left wondering, well, why? Because it looked kind of awesome with the retro and all this stuff.
6744000	6758000	Well, apparently, there's a statement from Yu Miyake, who's the executive producer of the Dragon Quest series, talking about Nintendo 3DS re-releases and saying they were popular in Japan, but they didn't sell as well as they hoped in the West.
6758000	6770000	Dragon Quest X hasn't released overseas, says the quote. The 3DS games weren't that popular overseas, and some folks jumped from Dragon Quest VIII all the way to Dragon Quest XI.
6771000	6783000	Basically indicating that Dragon Quest IX, which was 3DS exclusive, if I remember correctly, didn't sell that well over here, and may indicate why Dragon Quest XI they didn't feel like doing over here.
6784000	6791000	Hopefully still that Switch version is going to end up happening over here, because I know for me, I think I've moved on from the DS to the Switch.
6792000	6803000	I do kind of wish Nintendo would take the 3DS out back and shoot it already, but I got it a little more when the Switch was first launching, and we weren't sure if it was going to be a success.
6804000	6810000	But I think it's safe to say now, it's a success, so they can retire the 3DS. It's okay. Let it go.
6810000	6816000	But we all know that's not happening, because there's still the Luigi's Mansion remake, and lord knows what else.
6817000	6822000	So, anyway. Fifth dream in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, save it for Switch.
6823000	6827000	I want to jump back quickly to your last story about the game that got Brazil's attention.
6828000	6837000	Cajudo in chat says, the PC argument is bullshit. Us sane people know how to follow work rules, school rules, restaurant rules, movie theater rules, the internet is no different.
6837000	6845000	It has rules. Follow them. That's a good point. Yes, we have free speech, but I'm sure you all know free speech is A, not freedom from consequence.
6846000	6856000	Free speech has nothing to do with the place of private business and so forth. Brazil is a different country with their own laws, and I'm not up to up on their constitution and what governs their country. I apologize.
6857000	6859000	But maybe free speech isn't the same thing there. But anyway.
6860000	6861000	Well, I think it's still hate speech.
6861000	6874000	Well, my point is, you don't yell fire in a crowded theater, because free speech does not allow you to do that. You know what I mean? You're still in a private place of business, and not only are you breaking all sorts of societal laws, but you're basically, you know, you're being an asshole.
6875000	6876000	Don't be an asshole.
6877000	6879000	Exactly. If only more people just kind of knew that inherently, right?
6880000	6882000	It's weird that you have to tell somebody.
6883000	6887000	I know, right? But, I mean, you're raising kids. Do you have to educate your kids? Don't be a little asshole?
6888000	6889000	Yes.
6889000	6891000	And it's not always easy, is it?
6892000	6899000	Just like, just like my cat. Stop being a little asshole. Unfortunately, the cat doesn't speak English, so it's hard to communicate.
6900000	6901000	Yeah, but the cats know that they're being assholes.
6902000	6903000	That's true.
6904000	6905000	My cat does that all the time.
6906000	6907000	That's true.
6908000	6911000	Like, you'll pay attention to her, you'll pet her, you'll cuddle with her, and she gets up off your lap and then goes, wakes up the kids.
6912000	6913000	It's like, what the fuck is your problem?
6914000	6915000	Like, scratches at their doors.
6916000	6922000	Why are you doing that? I am paying attention. I'm giving you all the things you want. I gave you your food, I gave you your treats.
6923000	6924000	And this is the thanks I get.
6925000	6930000	And instead you're just like, fuck you, I'm scratching at the door. I'm gonna wake them up and piss you off. Ha ha ha ha.
6931000	6932000	More treats for me.
6933000	6935000	I don't think she understands what she's supposed to be doing.
6936000	6940000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys before we go to the Skype line at OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.
6940000	6948000	So this is a pretty awesome mod, but there's somebody that made a custom Mario 64 mod called Portal 64.
6949000	6953000	And it's, like you would think, it's Mario 64 with portals. Think he went portals.
6954000	6962000	So it's got all the usual suspects, you know, the portal gun, they've even got like a companion cube that's in one of these.
6963000	6968000	There's the cores falling around, instead of the castle, Peach's Castle, you have Aperture Labs.
6968000	6976000	Still collecting the stars and whatnot, but it's pretty cool, like you can use the portals for different jumps and things.
6977000	6988000	I'm not sure where you can necessarily download it yet, because I think it's still being worked on, but it's pretty cool to check out.
6988000	7000000	It was by a guy, Emanuar, I think. I can't see what his YouTube page is here. Yeah, Kaze Emanuar.
7001000	7004000	Mods are pretty amazing and the things that people do with them, isn't it?
7005000	7008000	Yeah, he calls it Portal 3, but it's basically Portal 64.
7009000	7010000	You wish!
7011000	7013000	It's pretty functional for a mod, I mean, it's pretty awesome, so...
7013000	7019000	Yeah, no, that is rad, and it's especially not just that you're modding a current game, but you're going back and you're modding it.
7020000	7025000	What is it about Mario 64 that that is always, because I feel like just like three months ago...
7026000	7027000	Mario 64 Maker, and like...
7028000	7030000	And then the Battle Royale in Mario 64 or something.
7031000	7032000	That was awesome, yeah, the online one.
7033000	7034000	Where they put Waluigi in there and all that stuff.
7035000	7036000	Nintendo shut that shit down.
7037000	7039000	Mario 64 online, it came back though, I think.
7039000	7043000	Well, yeah, it's the internet, it's whack-a-mole, Nintendo's C&D is one side because of somewhere else.
7044000	7058000	It was awesome, I wish, that's something like when they eventually add stuff to, you know, Mario 64 that I hope that they add online functionality or something like that to the Nintendo collection or whatever they're doing.
7059000	7061000	NES library whenever they move past the NES.
7062000	7068000	That's the type of stuff Nintendo, instead of the Zelda with all the rupees enabled, that's the type of thing they should be doing, huh?
7069000	7078000	I mean, if some Joe nobody that has no idea how you program the game, I mean, can do it, then why can't you do it? Oh, that's right, because it's online.
7079000	7080000	I forgot.
7081000	7091000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says there's a neat mod or ROM hack out there that blended Zelda A Link to the Past with Super Metroid and a randomizer.
7091000	7100000	You know, those randomizers are really the rage on Twitch. I was watching our buddy Breslil streaming Zelda randomizer. It was this morning or last night, one of those things.
7101000	7116000	Yeah, it was weird because like it basically made like any shop or level entrance could be anything. Like you might go to the level entrance for level one and it's the old lady who gives you a letter or something like completely different.
7117000	7119000	So he has to actually hunt around for the different levels. It was interesting.
7119000	7131000	Yeah, normally the ones I've seen with the randomizers haven't been with the doors. It was just the items in the chest. The chests were all randomized, so you might go someplace where you might get the sword, you might get something else.
7132000	7137000	Would that work though? Because wasn't Zelda sort of built where like you have to have the item in one dungeon to get to the next dungeon?
7138000	7139000	Like the original Zelda?
7140000	7141000	Yeah. I thought that was a thing.
7142000	7147000	Maybe. They might have some sort of safe guards for that, but this is A Link to the Past is what I was talking about.
7147000	7151000	Oh, oh, oh, okay. Gotcha. Oh yeah, I've seen The Link to the Past randomizer. I have seen that.
7152000	7161000	Yeah, but The Link to the Past randomizer though with Super Metroid would be awesome. I hope we see the next one or either the upcoming Game of Summer Quick or Summer Game of Summer Quick.
7162000	7166000	They're just throwing all this stuff in a blender now, seeing what they can come up with. It's pretty cool though. I like all this like retro stuff.
7166000	7176000	I do wish Nintendo kind of officially embraced this a little more. Maybe this whole Zelda thing that they did on the Switch is them kind of showing like we might be open to something a little different.
7177000	7182000	Can you imagine if Nintendo like fully embraced like a Zelda randomizer as a thing? That would be fucking rad.
7183000	7184000	It would be.
7185000	7192000	I think people would be really into that. And then it would also, instead of all these unofficial hacks and stuff out there, not that there's anything wrong with that because the community's created a beautiful thing,
7193000	7200000	but for Nintendo to like officially endorse that and take that on would create a benchmark. Imagine allowing like mod support for some of these games.
7201000	7208000	Like maybe not, you know, maybe we can police it where it's not like nudie mods and shit, but it's just like, you know, these randomizers.
7209000	7214000	What about the good things mods did? More difficult maps or different maps like brand new maps or something.
7214000	7220000	Yeah. Yeah. All right. Anyhow, our last story tonight before we open up the Skype line, although I will go to Loki for last minute news too.
7221000	7233000	Uh, guess what? A new company has started a gaming division. Uh, that's right. There's apparently a KFC gaming. That's right. Kentucky Fried Chicken.
7234000	7235000	They did have that weird VR game.
7235000	7248000	Is getting into gaming. All right. Uh, and of course a lot of people are kind of doing, oh, this is a throwback. Remember Yo Noid on the NES, which was, that was Domino's thing years ago, right?
7249000	7253000	Yeah. Or Cool Spot on the Super NES. Cool Spot was on, or actually it was on Genesis too.
7254000	7258000	One of the greatest games they ever released on Xbox 360, Sneak King, Limburger Kings games.
7259000	7267000	All their games are awesome. I only have Pocket Bike Racer. I don't know what happened to my Sneak King. I would have never sold it, so I don't know what happened.
7268000	7269000	Man, Sneak King was so good. So anyway.
7270000	7277000	It was great. They should have put out more games. Come on, come on guys. Like I'd even settle for like a Sneak King mobile game.
7278000	7283000	So anyway, apparently KFC now has a gaming division, so maybe we're going to see some type of game from them in the future.
7283000	7292000	And then this particular story has a picture of the new spokesperson for the new Colonel Sanders, who I believe, isn't that Reba? That's Reba McEntire that plays the Colonel now.
7293000	7298000	I thought she was a few, I don't know. I can't keep track of who's playing the Colonel nowadays, but I know she was.
7299000	7300000	It's always changing.
7301000	7302000	It is.
7303000	7309000	So anyway, we'll see what game. What game could Kentucky Fried Chicken come up with?
7310000	7314000	By the way, I'm going to open up the Skype line over Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.
7315000	7322000	The phone lines are open. If you want to do it the old fashioned way, 1-877-GAME-OLR. But Skype's probably better. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7323000	7328000	But I was going to say, what kind of game would you want to see KFC make?
7329000	7334000	How about a Mario Kart game, but you're racing drumsticks?
7335000	7342000	I would want to see whatever crazy shit they could come up with. Because remember, they had the whole VR game that was supposed to be a training game.
7343000	7349000	That was fucking weird. And I'm down with the fucking weird. If it's fast food, make it as strange as fucking possible.
7350000	7353000	Bob Coffey in chat suggests KFC versus Taco Bell.
7354000	7359000	I don't need a versus game. Unless it's a fighting game, in which case I'm down with the mascots fighting.
7360000	7365000	Doesn't the same parent company own KFC, Taco Bell, and I think Pizza Hut are all the same number.
7366000	7369000	Oh yeah, that's right. They're all Pepsi. Pepsi man. He runs everything.
7370000	7376000	There's the secret. It's like the final boss you have to get in the game. I thought I saw a call coming through, but then it disappeared.
7377000	7380000	But the Skype line is open at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7380000	7386000	Dark Tutsi is saying BK did a racing game, if I recall correctly, and yeah, that was the one you owned, right?
7387000	7390000	Anyway, we do have a call, so let's go to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7391000	7392000	Hey, what's going on everybody? It's Rama.
7393000	7394000	Hey Rama, buddy. How you doing?
7395000	7396000	I'm doing pretty good. How about you?
7397000	7398000	I am fantastic. What's on your mind tonight?
7399000	7407000	A few things, and I'll be on my merry little way. Now, if you tune into our show over at Anime Jam Session, if you listen, sometimes throughout the episode,
7407000	7411000	you will hear Mako Chan's cat, Damien, scream his little head off.
7412000	7415000	I'm glad it's not just us that's having cat issues during the show.
7416000	7423000	No. It's like when we're doing our How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, sometimes as we're going through our routine, you'll hear this cat meowing.
7424000	7425000	We all stop and go, hi, Damien.
7426000	7430000	And that's because the cat wants to play on How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.
7431000	7436000	Something like that, plus he's putting himself right on Mako Chan's shoulders going, my human.
7437000	7439000	I missed that segment. That's what we used to call it, you know?
7440000	7441000	Yeah.
7442000	7444000	Back before OLR was strictly video games, we used to call it How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.
7445000	7457000	Well, like I said, a lot of what Anime Jam Session does is heavily inspired by OLR, which, as I've said, we're like the bratty kid, sister, kid, brother of the show.
7458000	7461000	And I love it, but I'm also speaking to you through that cat.
7462000	7464000	And I believe it, every single minute of it.
7464000	7466000	What else is on your mind, buddy?
7467000	7474000	Now, I know Loki mentioned DDR earlier, so I gotta know. What is y'all's go-to song for DDR?
7475000	7479000	It's Rainin' Men by Jerry Howell. No, that's what you want me to say. That's what you want me to say.
7480000	7488000	No, it depends what mix I'm playing. I always liked the ones that were very, like, constant stream of notes was a good warm-up.
7489000	7494000	So when Fourth Mix was All the Rage, I always thought Kick the Can was a great warm-up song.
7495000	7498000	You know, obviously, for one, it's got that great little...
7501000	7504000	You know, it's obviously the old, you know, classic tune that's incorporated in the dance song.
7505000	7507000	But it was just like that constant stream of eighth notes made, like, a really good warm-up song.
7508000	7511000	But that song isn't around in newer mixes.
7512000	7513000	It was like Fourth Mix and Fourth Mix.
7513000	7518000	Yeah, but that was, like, my go-to warm-up. I used to do Ghosts when that was available, when we had a max machine.
7519000	7524000	But that's no longer available. I'm not sure what I would do on an Extreme machine these days.
7525000	7527000	Because that's the machine that you have in your house, right? You have a Dance Dance Revolution Extreme?
7528000	7529000	Yes.
7530000	7531000	Do you have, like, a same go-to starter song that you do every day?
7532000	7535000	Well, I play non-stop random mixes, so it's whatever comes up.
7536000	7542000	So if I'm playing just, like, actual songs, I don't know, it just depends what kind of a mood I'm in.
7543000	7553000	I mean, usually I like Last Message or 1998's Pretty Good or Dance Dance Revolution.
7554000	7555000	You know what song?
7556000	7557000	Fantasy.
7558000	7561000	You know what song I will still rock in DDR Extreme to this day? My answer? Butterfly.
7562000	7563000	I can see it.
7564000	7569000	The butterfly steps are really, I play that once in a while because it'll come up on my, the non-stop or whatever.
7569000	7577000	But, like, the steps for doubles are kind of, they're mirrored. So, like, you do one pattern and it mirrors it and you do it again.
7578000	7579000	It's just, like, it's kind of boring.
7580000	7582000	Kick the Can would be my real answer, though, if it's a machine that has that.
7583000	7584000	I like that.
7585000	7590000	Oh, and I also like, what was the other one? So In Love has actually got some pretty fun steps to play.
7591000	7593000	I don't know.
7593000	7602000	Man, y'all want me to get a DDR machine. This is making me want to get a DDR machine more and more, but, you know, it's just not in the cards right now, maybe in the future.
7603000	7608000	Well, I mean, you could kind of build your own step mania machine and just kind of make your way up, you know?
7609000	7616000	Yeah, I guess that's true. You know, it'd be about kind of getting, it's all about that right dance pad that isn't going to, like, fuck up your floor.
7617000	7621000	If you want to spend a ton of money, you can always buy the step mania, step maniac ones.
7621000	7623000	Well, at that point, why not just buy the fucking game?
7624000	7625000	Yeah, you're probably surprised.
7626000	7628000	Honestly. That's my thought, anyway.
7629000	7630000	So true, so true.
7631000	7637000	Yeah, ask your 200 Matt in our chat over at live.voguenetwork.com. Absolutely right, it will be Mr. Smoosh's DDR machine. That is absolutely right.
7638000	7640000	Surprisingly enough, my cat does not give a shit about the DDR machine.
7641000	7642000	Really?
7643000	7644000	Yeah, she does not lay on it.
7645000	7646000	Does the cat not enjoy the garage, maybe?
7646000	7653000	She loves the garage. She likes sleeping in a paint tray that's in our, like, our shelving. We, like, store our paints in, like, a shelving unit.
7654000	7660000	So she's hidden back there and she'll sleep in those, like, a paint tray. Not the four beds we have in the house, but the paint tray.
7661000	7664000	But she won't touch the cabinet. She won't sleep near it or anything.
7665000	7672000	I think it's because it's too cold. She likes the warmth, especially in the summer. Like, it's like 100 degrees out there and she'll go to sleep out there.
7672000	7682000	Even in the winter, though, she'll come out there sometimes and sleep. But no, never touches the machine. But once again, I think it's because it's all metal and it's cold. So she won't, doesn't like it.
7683000	7685000	Interesting. Anything else on your mind tonight, Rama?
7686000	7699000	One more thing, and we'll be on our merry little way. On the anime jam session, we understand some of the issues and how some things in OLR and gaming can cross over with anime and anime jam session.
7699000	7706000	So in regards to YYR's email, we will gladly sponsor This Week and Bowsette for Orange Lounge Radio.
7707000	7709000	Have a great night, Rama. It was good to hear from you.
7713000	7725000	I just, I just don't understand why it's everywhere. It's like you can't escape it. Like, somebody showed me a fucking video. It was like, they took New Super Mario Brothers Wii or whatever.
7725000	7732000	It was one of the New Super Mario Brothers games in the level where Bowser chases you in the castle and they made it Bowsette. Why? Because they can.
7733000	7736000	There's also a mod for Breath of the Wild where you can play as Bowsette.
7737000	7738000	Yippee!
7739000	7759000	I can't explain it. Sometimes I can't. Sometimes I can't. It's just something that everybody is loving and, you know, last week there was a comic somebody drew of all the popular meme waifus telling Bowsette, enjoy your 15 minutes of fame while you can before you get tossed in the trash.
7760000	7761000	Put me in that picture.
7762000	7765000	Breath of the Wild's footage. Her dress is doing some weird physics, man. That's all I gotta say.
7765000	7770000	SSJ100Matt in our chat points out the real exciting news of the week is that Rob will be coming back to New York City soon.
7771000	7782000	Yes, with the news that Lady Gaga may be in a Broadway play, my good Judy Victoria down in LA is like, we're going. We're going to New York City. We're gonna see this fucking play with Gaga. If it's true.
7783000	7788000	And they haven't officially announced that yet, but I'm really overdue for a New York visit. Allen's never been and he really wants to go sometimes.
7788000	7800000	So I think Toronto's like for sure next year and I really want to work in New York City. I'm not going to do MAGFest, which I know is sad, but that frees me up to be able to do some other stuff. So that's kind of the thought process there.
7801000	7807000	I'm perfectly okay with that because Mako-chan wants to meet you and Allen. She wants to add you two to her collection.
7808000	7813000	Ah, well, I'm already an honorary member, I would hope. But yes, officially it would be nice.
7813000	7822000	Yes. Remember, there was an episode way back when of Ask Orange Lodge where she did ask, but now a picture or two together, it'll be official.
7823000	7825000	Yeah, we'll make it official. We will. We'll get ring pops and everything.
7826000	7831000	Don't give her any ideas. You don't know.
7832000	7836000	Look out, bitch. I'll get her a Bowser crown. Then you'll really be sorry for inflicting that on the internet.
7836000	7843000	Cosplay's daisy to my Luigi. Don't give her more of a inflated head than she already has.
7844000	7851000	SS 2100 Matt says, it's been over 10 years since Rob has come to New York. I had hair when Rob was in New York last. So did I.
7852000	7855000	Anyway, I'm going to let you go. Thanks for the call.
7856000	7857000	Take care, bros.
7858000	7860000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to get through.
7861000	7863000	Loki, any last minute stories?
7863000	7867000	Well, you took both my Bowser stories. I guess I can't read them.
7868000	7869000	Gosh, I'm so upset.
7870000	7878000	Oh, darn. So I guess the annual annual desert bus for hope is starting going to be soon.
7879000	7884000	November 9th, they're going to be starting at 10 a.m. and apparently they're starting their fundraising.
7884000	7894000	So last year they raised six hundred fifty thousand dollars or one hundred fifty eight hours for Child's Play.
7895000	7897000	So maybe they'll top it again. We'll see.
7898000	7899000	Good cause.
7900000	7904000	Yep. And then, of course, the Mortal Kombat trilogy apparently is having a fan remake.
7905000	7909000	Apparently people are redoing the graphics in the game, doing like an HD remaster type of thing.
7910000	7913000	Why? I don't get it. Are they redigitizing the characters or something?
7914000	7919000	I. Yeah, it looks like they might be doing that or like I don't know if they're filming different characters or something.
7920000	7923000	What they're doing is there says the fan project has been under development since 2011.
7924000	7930000	It started as a Mugen project and it's not going to be one soon.
7931000	7937000	This is a pixel perfect arcade remake of the original Mortal Kombat trilogy using new 3D models created from the original Mortal Kombat games.
7938000	7942000	From all of the behind the scenes clips from massive scale.
7942000	7952000	Oh, because Tobias or Boone, one of those guys on Twitter, was putting out like videos of the motion capture from back in the day.
7953000	7957000	So somebody must have picked that up and was like, we can make HD video out of this.
7958000	7959000	That's interesting. Wow.
7960000	7963000	Yeah. So Tiger Claw actually links video of the HD remakes.
7964000	7969000	I kind of want to see this. I don't like to usually play YouTube's live on air, but we're running a little short tonight.
7970000	7971000	So I'll play play this.
7972000	7977000	Wow. That does look really good compared to the original.
7978000	7981000	Yeah. They kind of went back and redid the backgrounds.
7982000	7983000	That's the other important part.
7984000	7986000	Like they totally went back and redid those backgrounds.
7987000	7992000	So this is a Scorpion and Sub-Zero, which obviously is just the same with a palette swap.
7993000	7996000	But they're in that stage where Shang Tsung is sitting in the background.
7997000	8000000	Huh. Okay. I got to give it to him.
8000000	8004000	That looks pretty fricking good. Ooh, where's the fatality? Ooh, the fatalities at the end.
8006000	8007000	Gross.
8008000	8010000	Wow. They made that HD too.
8011000	8012000	Okay.
8013000	8017000	Curious to see what they come up with there. Thanks for that leak for YouTube. That's the first I've heard of that.
8018000	8019000	Yeah. So it was pretty neat.
8020000	8024000	Well, one more call for calls to see if anybody wants to get through Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8025000	8026000	Anything else for last minute stories?
8027000	8031000	Someone's trying to remake the single player campaign of Goldeneye in Unreal 4.
8032000	8034000	Again? Didn't we have a remake on like the Wii?
8035000	8037000	Well, we have like an official remake that we did.
8038000	8039000	But no, this is someone else doing it now.
8040000	8041000	All right. Fair enough.
8042000	8049000	Well, Goldeneye is one of those things where it's like I play, or not me personally, but I've heard people say I play first person shooters because of Goldeneye.
8050000	8052000	Like Goldeneye got me into this. So, you know, people have a lot of love for that game.
8052000	8055000	So I'm not surprised people want to go back and play the classic.
8056000	8058000	Why don't we have a Goldeneye Battle Royale game yet?
8059000	8060000	Guys are slow.
8061000	8062000	Licensing nightmare. That's the problem.
8063000	8064000	Oh, fan game. Licensing.
8065000	8070000	Yeah, but they can't call it Goldeneye. And if you don't call it Goldeneye, people are going to be like, Golden Spy.
8075000	8080000	What would you call it? Jim Band Golden Spy.
8082000	8084000	I don't know what you'd do. Anyway.
8085000	8091000	All right. Well, I guess nobody else is trying to call. So that's it. That's going to do it for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio.
8092000	8094000	A little bit shorter, but that's the way it goes sometimes. Some weeks are bigger than others.
8095000	8097000	We'll be back in seven days to do it all over again.
8098000	8102000	But in the meantime, I'm going to say, as I always do, thank you so much for listening to the show.
8103000	8106000	Thank you for taking time out of your week to be here with us on Sunday night.
8107000	8109000	Or if you're listening to us on the podcast feed, that's always appreciated as well.
8109000	8113000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show and help us spread the word.
8114000	8118000	Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here to air, then what are we going to do?
8119000	8125000	So, yeah, there's that. That's it. That's all I have to say. Loki, any final thoughts for you tonight?
8126000	8134000	My final thought is that hopefully I'm going to be streaming on Twitch soon, so just waiting on my hardware to come in.
8135000	8136000	That's exciting. Sure is.
8136000	8140000	And hopefully the bandwidth can hold all that.
8141000	8145000	And then my final thought is I need to be streaming on Twitch more. I haven't done it in a few days.
8146000	8150000	And it's just, you know, real life gets in the way. I do it where I can, though. It happens.
8151000	8155000	But then I'll be like, oh, I'm going to get sucked into another MMO or another Facebook game or something like that.
8156000	8158000	And then it's like, whoops, I haven't been streaming lately. Oops, my bad.
8159000	8164000	Anyway, but we will be back in seven days. That's the one thing we will be doing, is we always do another episode of OLR in seven days.
8164000	8169000	Dark Sakura, I think, is still working next week, so she won't be here, but we will have you guys here.
8170000	8173000	And who knows, maybe we'll try to find a fun guest to bring us to. That was a lot of fun with Delvin last week.
8174000	8176000	So we'll hopefully have some more third chairs sitting in with us in the coming week.
8177000	8180000	Anyway, that's going to do it for another episode of OLR. Thanks for being here, and we'll see you next time.
8181000	8182000	Have a great week. Happy gaming.
8183000	8185000	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
