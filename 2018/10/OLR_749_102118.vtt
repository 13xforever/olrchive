00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 749 for this October the 21st of 2018.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
Joining you in studio, myself, Rob Roberts, and say hello to Loki with me, as always.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Hello.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Hi, how are you?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm here.

00:55.000 --> 01:04.000
Yes, you're smelling up my whole house with garlic with your food choice tonight. No, but you went to a place that I recommended to you, so I'm psyched to have you try it, because some of the best-

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Halal chicken, or fried chicken.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
Yeah, halal fried chicken, and I went there for the first time with Alan like a week ago, and I was like, dang, that's some of the best. And they don't pay me to do these ads, by the way.

01:13.000 --> 01:24.000
I know you listen to a lot of podcasts that start off with ads, they're gonna tell you about some boxed meal thing, or some bed. No, this is just legit, like, our lives, and you know what, sometimes I get really excited about food.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
So, I felt the need to share, yeah, I thought this place was really good, so.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah, it's pretty good.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Yeah.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Yeah, they just took a little bit of time getting stuff ready, but it's good.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
It happens, it happens.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
So I got chicken and waffles.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Uh-huh, as one does.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Well, now all I have is waffles, because chicken's gone.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Chicken's gone, but the chicken was good?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Chicken was pretty good, yeah.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Yeah, chicken was good.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Probably could have gotten more chicken.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Did you just get, like, strips, or did you get, like, the type you eat off the bone?

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
I got, like, chicken legs.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Okay, yeah.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Yeah, drumsticks.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
I like chicken, I like the fried chicken, yeah, the drumsticks are good, yeah.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
Yeah, so I could have gotten the strips, I guess, but I, this is really my only meal

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
today, so I was like, I can do whatever I want.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Izzy or this, I'm gonna drive to Quiznos, the only Quiznos that's still around my house.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
I didn't know there was anywhere left.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
Which is, like, all the way by the other freeway, and, like, it's, like, 20 minutes out of

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
the way, but I may go there next week.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Okay, all right, we'll check in with you.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Next week, you know, it's kind of a landmark number, so it's 750.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Oh, yeah.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Dark Sakura, not with us tonight.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
She'll be joining us a little later via Magic for the Classic Game of the Week, which is

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
kind of fun this week.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
It's a little two-in-one, you'll know what I mean when we get there.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
But Dark Sakura, she'll be here next week, and it actually kind of works out, because

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
next week is 750 episodes of OLR, which, you know, I don't know, like, I know a lot of

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
podcasts will celebrate 50, 100, and, you know, every episode of which we're celebrating

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
that your show's still going, you know, 200 and so forth, but, you know, what are the

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
landmark numbers after, like, 500?

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
I think 750 could be a landmark number, because it's like three-fourths of the way to 1,000.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
I don't know, is 750 kind of a big number?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
I think it is.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
I think it is a big number.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
So Jamie will be here with us next week in studio.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
It just happens to also be the week that she's able to arrange her work schedule to be here,

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
so that'll be very nice.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
So, yeah.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
But this week, we have a lot of news to get into here at the top of the show.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I wanted to talk about the podcast thing real fast, though.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
I know I kind of cracked a joke there, but not that I'm usually one to read other podcasts,

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
because, you know, I'm a big fan of supporting every indie podcast, and I think you guys should,

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
you know, I really want to promote people making their own stuff, you know,

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
especially people that don't feel like they have a voice out there.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
I really, especially with some of the news today, good God.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Like, I'm just like, please elevate more voices so people can relate to, you know, people.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
And then, anyway, I'm getting on a tangent.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
But for, like, some of the non-indie stuff, I got to shade a little bit.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Like, I was checking out this one podcast.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
I won't name the podcast, but it's a top 50-ish iTunes show that I do enjoy to listen to.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
And I started the show, and I swear to God, it was like the first five and a half minutes

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
were nothing but there was, like, a commercial at the beginning.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
There was an intro where the hosts talk about other shows on the network that you should be listening to.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
And then they played a full minute clip from one of those, like, other shows.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
And then, like, finally five minutes and a half in, they finally get to the topic.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
And I'm like, this is asking a lot of your audience for an hour show.

04:08.000 --> 04:16.000
Like, I realize, as a gaming podcast, it's a three-hour, you know, two to three-hour gaming podcast show.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
We don't always get right into the video games, but, you know, at least I'm not, like,

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
plugging your ear off with other stuff and, you know, mattresses and food supply and books on tape.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
I mean, I support podcasters.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
That's how they gotta make money nowadays.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
I support podcasters' right to make coin, don't get me wrong.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
I'm not trying to say, like, oh, we're better than that. That's not what I'm saying at all.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
And I told, you know, one day we might have an arrangement, but I would just like to think

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
not five and a half minutes at the beginning of your show, you know what I mean?

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
Like, sprinkle it out a little bit. Save it for a commercial break in the middle or something, you know what I mean?

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
I don't know. What do you guys think in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com?

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network,

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
vognetwork.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, and that's an ad I will always give for free,

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
is for our pal Bobby Black Wolf, so there you go.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
Tigerclaw on chat says, most podcasts use Patreon to support them.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
That's true. That's the way a lot of indie podcasts have gone.

05:20.000 --> 05:28.000
Even with the Patreon, though, usually it's like, you know, we've got our Dollar Shave Club and...

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Well, that's not Patreon.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Well, no, with that.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Oh, that and commercials. Yeah, I gotcha, I gotcha.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
I'm trying to think of all the ones that I commonly hear.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
SeatGeek or like...

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Well, don't give them all free plugs now.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
All the different VPNs and stuff out there.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
But anyway, no, I was gonna say, no, I'm fine, and we do not have a Patreon for the record,

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
but that is a choice that we made for our own reasons,

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
and if other indie podcasts want to use Patreon to support them, I'm all for that.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Go for it.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
So, you know, we have talked about other things that we might do instead of Patreon in the near future,

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
and if you've been paying attention the last couple months, you can probably figure it out pretty quick,

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
what direction we are going in, but, you know, I don't know.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
Anyway, I'm also going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Let's see, Dark Tetsuya in chat says,

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
I can see you doing ads during the break, but right off the bat, come on now.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
I'm even okay with like a little opening ad.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
Like, okay, I will name this one by name because I'm actually gonna compliment it.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
I love this show called Why Won't You Date Me with Nicole Byer.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Have you watched Nailed It on Netflix?

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
The show with the cakes that they...

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Have you seen that? Okay.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
She's the host and she's fucking funny.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
And she has her own podcast about basically the title, Why Won't People Date Me.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
You know, and just get into dating times, like a love relationship type of podcast.

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
And she always opens with her own ad, but like she's funny and she makes a lot of the stuff funny.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
And then it's like the one little ad and then the show.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
And, you know, then I think she does another ad in the middle or whatever.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
And that's fine because it's one ad.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
It's not like a barrage of stuff. You know what I mean?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
That's kind of the difference. So, anyway.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Shout out to Nicole Byer. You're my hero.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Let's see.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Also in chat, one more comment and then we'll get into games.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Because you guys were probably sitting there going,

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
Rob, you're like seven minutes into your show and you still haven't gone into games.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
TigerClan chat says, the thing about Patreon is there are some podcasts

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
who post episodes that only a Patreon subscriber can listen to or view.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Oh, yeah. That's a super common thing. That's a super common thing.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
It would be the type of chat that honestly we've been doing for the past five minutes

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
that we're just giving to you because that's just all we've ever known

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
in the time that we've been doing podcasting.

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
But anyway, if you feel so inclined to tip us, there will be ways to do that later on.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
But honestly, you know what? We've been doing it for free for 17 years.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Like, are we going to suddenly change it tomorrow?

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Or excuse me, 16 years. I'm at the point where we've lost count.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Are we going to just change it overnight? No, we're not going to do that to you.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
With tips, we're going to start remembering how many years we've been doing it.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Accurate information.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
I can't remember the information that if only I had 50 cents right now.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Alright, anyway.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
We almost got the killer, but we ran out of money.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
Please insert a quarter to continue the show.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
And our show will be the same difficulty level as the Ninja Turtles arcade game back in the day.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
We will constantly have to throw quarters into it.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Okay, let's get into our kickoff topic.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Do you want to cover this? You want me to do this?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
About the new Intellivision.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
So we have a new console that got announced this weekend.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I have no idea what's going on with Intellivision.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Other than Tommy Tallarico is somehow involved and that's it.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
He is. So Intellivision never really went away.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Like, Atari sold the name and sold all the rights.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
You don't say Atari. He's stealing their stuff.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
Well, Intellivision has kind of been there.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
They were there for a while. They made their last game very late.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Like, into the late 80s, maybe even early 90s.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
So they were making their games for a while.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
And then, of course, the company continued to do the Intellivision Lives stuff.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
Remember, that was kind of big back when we were working with all games.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
Because I remember one of the E3s we were there.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
They were like big guests at the event.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Yeah, that was O5 because that was still the original Xbox too.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Yeah, so there was all that going on.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Intellivision has kind of been around.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
But now Tommy Tallarico is kind of like he's put money into the company.

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
And now he's kind of, you know, like the new blood coming in to come up with some new ideas and some new things.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
And now we have an idea what that is.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
So it's going to be called the Amico is the new system.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Now, I want you to get this out of your heads right away.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
This is not a competitor to the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox One.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
This is not something that's going to be state-of-the-art graphics and things like that.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
In fact, they've very much said that is not what they're doing with this.

09:56.000 --> 10:03.000
They chose to do their big reveal at the Portland Retro Gaming Expo, which is, you know, it's not an E3.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
No shade to the Portland Retro Gaming Expo.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I would love to go to the Portland Retro Gaming Expo.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
In fact, if I kind of knew that was coming up, I might have gone.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Because Portland is maybe a 10-hour drive. It's not that far.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
But anyway, I'm not shading it.

10:13.000 --> 10:20.000
I'm just saying it's not typical you hear about a new console at a thing that's not E3 or even PAX or, you know, some big fan event.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
So anyway, they actually announced this is the date we're releasing.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
10-10-20. So October 10th, 2020 is the date that they're going to be releasing this console.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
No price, but they are aiming for an amount between $149 to $179.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
Here's what's something a little different about this.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
The controllers are going to be things that you actually put inside the console to use wireless charging.

10:44.000 --> 10:52.000
If you remember the old Intellivision from the 80s, the controllers kind of went in the console too as kind of like their resting space to keep things clean.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
But of course they had those big telephone wires that kind of connected it to the actual...

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
And if you know what I mean by telephone wires...

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
I only know from a Coleco because a Coleco is basically the same.

11:01.000 --> 11:11.000
But instead of like the number pad, remember the thing that really made the Intellivision different was those little sleeve cards that you would put inside.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
You mean the same thing that the ColecoVision had?

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Yeah. Intellivision did that too.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
You put in those little cards into like the top of the controller.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
It was a piece of plastic that sat on top of the buttons.

11:22.000 --> 11:33.000
So instead of just being 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, it would be like, oh, it's a little picture of these four arrows so you know these buttons are move and this one is shoot.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
You know, things like that.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Well, what they're going to do with this new system instead is that that's going to be a touchscreen.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
So it's kind of something a little different.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Cool.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
So they'll have a little disk, but it's not going to be like the disk it was before.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
It'll be something that's a little more usable, honestly.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
And then a little touchscreen to do that.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
So that's kind of a neat little throwback, I suppose.

11:51.000 --> 12:01.000
And then I guess something else they're going to do, which I think this is a really good idea, they're going to have an app for mobile phones that will allow your phone to act as an additional controller.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Which, you know, is obviously a great idea.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
I think we started seeing with like Jackbox Party Pack does something like that to have all these different controllers by just using mobile devices.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
So the Intellivision is going to have something like that built in.

12:15.000 --> 12:24.000
The console is said to have 21st century 2D chip and architecture, so they are coming out the gate saying 2D games only.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
No 3D games.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
What about 2.5D? Is that going to be too much?

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
I don't think you could do that because really 2.5D is 3D.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
It's a 2D game kind of made in a 3D space.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
Well, I actually know now that I'm blabbing, I don't know.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
What would a game like Zelda Link to the Past be considered?

12:40.000 --> 12:47.000
Because it's a 2.5D game, some would call it that because like the above thing, but it's all sprite based, you know what I mean?

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
That would be like still 2D, but like Donkey Kong Country, it's all pre-rendered.

12:52.000 --> 12:59.000
Yeah, so I guess, okay, it just kind of depends how you are choosing to render that.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
If you can run it on the hardware, more power to you, I think.

13:03.000 --> 13:11.000
Exactly. They're saying that the 2D will be stronger than PlayStation 4 and Xbox One because these machines are 3D focused.

13:11.000 --> 13:20.000
So instead of having to fake a 2D game in a 3D rendering engine like Unity, this is something that's going to really focus on 2D games.

13:20.000 --> 13:30.000
And the games will be no more than $8, or if you want to nitpick, $7.99, but we all know that's $8.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
So the games will be no more than $8 and no less than $3, $2.99 if I must.

13:35.000 --> 13:43.000
So these are going to be low cost games, and the games will only be E-rated or E-10 rated games.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
No violent games allowed, sorry Loki.

13:46.000 --> 13:54.000
And that also means no nudity, so we can't have like booby slapper, the game will not be coming out on the amico, sad to say.

13:54.000 --> 14:10.000
But even something like bungee ferret tossing, our pal YYR is classic, that would probably not be able to be done on television because it's got the fake destruction of animals, opposed to weapons.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
You're not bothered by this.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
You can just make it less violent.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Just turn the blood into sweat.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Change the blood into sweat.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
Anyhow, they want to pitch this as something that parents want to buy.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
So you can also see the market they're really aiming for.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
They want this to be a family machine, a kid machine.

14:36.000 --> 14:47.000
I wonder if they aren't aiming for a very kind of like, the type of homes that usually shun video games altogether, because video games are the devil type of thing.

14:47.000 --> 14:58.000
Like if this isn't the type of thing where they're kind of more aiming for those types of households where this console, because it has that rule, might be okay I suppose.

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
There will also be remade Atari and iMagic games, they will be exclusive to the system.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
Any game that is remade they say will have updated graphics, audio, added levels, and multiplayer.

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
The console will allow lots of sprites, so it's going to be a very sprite based thing.

15:14.000 --> 15:22.000
There will also be an occasional retail release of games, though it would be a special and premium price, probably similar to why Switch cartridges are a little more pricey.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
But you can imagine that most things are going to be done digitally, as I suppose they are with your mobile phones.

15:27.000 --> 15:34.000
The Amico will come with leaderboard support and some type of achievement system unique to the Amico.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
So already Intellivision sounds like they have their online more together than Nintendo, right?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Yes.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Leaderboards and achievements, we got something there.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Really.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Devkits coming out next summer.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
Intellivision will be paying developers to make games for the system.

15:48.000 --> 15:54.000
You pitch your game to Intellivision, and if they think it doesn't sound like garbage, they're going to fund your game.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Interesting.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
I don't know, do you think they're being too limiting?

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
Loki, you're grinning ear to ear, what are you going to say with this?

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
I was going to say, you know, my initial reaction was, ooh yeah!

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Because we had the same fucking shit.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I got the joke, I got the joke.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
The ooh yeah didn't really do that stuff.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Yes they did.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
But that all fell apart quickly.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Right, yeah, I understand that.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
Anyway, more details will arrive tomorrow.

16:25.000 --> 16:33.000
So by the time most of you hear this podcast, that's the unfortunate thing about the delay between our live taping here and when most of you guys will actually hear it.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
But there are going to be more details Monday, I assume that's going to be in a trailer.

16:37.000 --> 16:44.000
But I wouldn't expect too much two years out, especially with dev kits not coming out until next year.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
So, I had a few more notes on this.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
Loki, any initial thoughts on what I'm saying while I dig up? Because there was a couple of other notes I had on this.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
I'm cautiously skeptical.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
How so?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
I don't want to pay for a new console.

17:00.000 --> 17:12.000
Especially with a track record right now, because as much as I, you know, I like Tommy Dalryko, but we'll see what happens when it comes out.

17:13.000 --> 17:24.000
Let's see. Oh, yeah, the whole like, there's no financial risk for developers because accepted pitches will be funded by Intellivision and the costs will be from future royalties.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Which I find very fascinating.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
And the other thing was that they will, okay, this is the big one.

17:30.000 --> 17:36.000
There was a quote said during the presentation, when did quantity take over for quality?

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
No ports allowed on the console.

17:40.000 --> 17:48.000
Which, I mean, that's a lot of borders Intellivision is drawing for its console.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
No ports, $8 or less, although they'll fund the development, so there's that.

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
And it has to be like a 7 out of 10 type of game. Like no shovelware on Steam.

17:59.000 --> 18:05.000
We'll see. I mean, that's tough saying that you don't want ports and stuff.

18:05.000 --> 18:15.000
Because how are you going to, that's a, I mean, I understand it's not a risk for development as far as money goes, but time is a risk as well.

18:15.000 --> 18:22.000
So am I going to spend like all this time developing a game and then release it on your platform, make no money off of it?

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
I mean, I guess you paid for my development, but still, I mean, it's time as well.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Kaijuto in chat says, sounds like a lot of half-baked games.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
Tigerclaw in chat says, no ports, yet they will have remakes of classic Atari games.

18:34.000 --> 18:42.000
You know, I gotta say though, that is one way to kinda open the door and get people interested in this system.

18:42.000 --> 18:47.000
I mean, this system probably won't have a problem getting shelf space at a place like Target.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
Because if you look, if your Target's big enough, right, I mean, they probably don't sell these at like city Targets.

18:52.000 --> 18:58.000
But at the, you know, regular sized Targets, if you look, they've got a section where they sell like flashback consoles.

18:58.000 --> 19:04.000
And heck, this thing, I forgot to talk about this on the show last night. Do you notice I added a new mini arcade game to my collection?

19:04.000 --> 19:12.000
This is a different line of mini arcade things now. And I think it is just simply called My Arcade. That's what it's called.

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
So I got a BurgerTime machine. So that one, you notice it's a little bigger, it's a little fatter than the other ones?

19:17.000 --> 19:22.000
And it's honestly, it's probably a slightly little better game that's in there too.

19:22.000 --> 19:28.000
Well, obviously it's BurgerTime. It's one of the all-time best. But I paid $35 for that whereas the other ones were $20.

19:28.000 --> 19:39.000
But that was at Target. And there's still like three more to get to. I think they had Pac-Man, Galaga, and Dig Dug were the other games that they were offering in that.

19:39.000 --> 19:47.000
But my point is, Target sells that stuff. So if the Intellivision, as kind of like a way to get people interested is,

19:47.000 --> 19:58.000
yes, not only does it play Atari and Intellivision old games, but it's got the old and the new versions of those games and more.

19:58.000 --> 20:09.000
I think that might make Target and some of those retailers perk up because it's basically a retro and then some type of console. Am I right?

20:09.000 --> 20:18.000
But I think the leaderboard stuff is where things really get interesting. I'm a big fan of retro gaming. Take a game like BurgerTime.

20:19.000 --> 20:28.000
If somebody would just make that, but it actually was just like it ran similar to the old game. They didn't try to go over the top with, you know,

20:28.000 --> 20:34.000
because there was a BurgerTime game that came out on WiiWare not that long ago. And it was like you were running around in a 3D environment.

20:34.000 --> 20:42.000
And now the burger guy, he has a real name, Peter Pepper or whatever his name is, now he's in a 3D environment and running around.

20:42.000 --> 20:49.000
And it's like, no, no, no, just stick to the classic. And so the Intellivision game can kind of stick to the classic and have like leaderboards and stuff.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
That could be interesting. I don't know. I think I might be into something like that.

20:52.000 --> 20:59.000
I'm just curious to see what the games look like and what actually, how it runs and all that. How quickly it's going to be hacked open because they'll be like immediately.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Because that sucker's going to be a powerful...

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
Is your goal to get blood and titties on the Intellivision through the art of hacking?

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
Tell me I can't have something. It just makes me want to have it more.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Maybe Loki will finally finish a game.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
Blood, sweat and titties coming out for the Intellivision amico.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
It's looking less likely every day, unfortunately.

21:22.000 --> 21:28.000
There's just so much I'm cramming into my day. Like that is just right now.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
I'm not even going to pretend that there's progress being made because there's no progress being made.

21:34.000 --> 21:42.000
I understand. Also, I think one place where I bet a lot of people are going to kind of lose sight of this when they...

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
Because I can see that there's going to be a lot of armchair critics right now that are going to say,

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
This thing sounds like a flop in the making.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
This thing sounds like a flop in the making.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
Oh wait, what? Are you seeing something?

21:55.000 --> 22:02.000
Number one, fuck all the way off. Number two, I think some people are not considering the global market.

22:02.000 --> 22:16.000
And I think that Tommy Tallarico might be having an eye not just on America and the desire for a guaranteed family-friendly thing, a cost-effective thing in America,

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
but I think the worldwide is a very interesting component.

22:20.000 --> 22:33.000
I think if the Intellivision can launch in places like Brazil, Argentina, you know, Africa, places that don't usually get a lot of these top-tier gaming consoles,

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
other parts of the world. The world is a big fucking place, y'all.

22:36.000 --> 22:42.000
And if the Intellivision can kind of be a cheaper piece of gaming hardware and launch in some of these other places,

22:43.000 --> 22:50.000
then why wouldn't maybe this have success in those places?

22:50.000 --> 22:58.000
You know, we talked for a long time about how the Master System was popular for a long time in Brazil, and I think the Genesis still is.

22:58.000 --> 23:05.000
I bet the Intellivision would do great in Brazil. And there's a lot of fucking people in Brazil.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
You know what I mean?

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
Well, why do the other systems not do well?

23:10.000 --> 23:16.000
They're too expensive because Sony doesn't have an official presence in a place like Brazil.

23:16.000 --> 23:23.000
ActDeaf has called in before to kind of explain this a little bit, but if a company does not have that official presence,

23:23.000 --> 23:28.000
and they're manufacturing the consoles in that country or what have you, or the distribution is happening in the country,

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
because obviously PlayStation is made in Japan, they come over here, but it's still being distributed in the US.

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
So if you don't have that official distribution in the country, then you're importing.

23:38.000 --> 23:45.000
You have to import everything. And that's where things get crazy, because basically every PlayStation 4 somebody has in a place like Brazil

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
was imported from, at least I think, Sony does not have an official Brazil presence.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
I am so sorry if I'm incorrect. Obviously I don't live there, I'm not on the up and up.

23:55.000 --> 24:00.000
But I believe in a place like Brazil, you have to import a PlayStation 4 from the US.

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
So now you have to buy it from the US and they want to cut it the money.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
You have to ship it from the US to Brazil and they want to cut it the money.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
You have to sell it in a Brazil store, they want to cut it the money.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
These things get more and more expensive.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
And they become a lot more of a novelty, I suppose.

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
And ActDeaf is backing me up there, thank you. Yeah, pretty much Rob Roberts.

24:22.000 --> 24:30.000
And Bobby Blackwolf points out, he does a lot of video game live shows in places like Argentina, Brazil, Chile.

24:30.000 --> 24:36.000
Video Games Live sells out soccer stadiums in Brazil. So, there's that too.

24:36.000 --> 24:42.000
Caijudo, with another interesting angle, this is going to be the first console for gamers over 50.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
It's going to be in every old folks home around the world.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
Caijudo, I get where you're kind of going, I think it's a little tongue in cheek.

24:49.000 --> 24:55.000
But, you know what beat the Intellivision to every old folks home in America? The Wii.

24:55.000 --> 25:04.000
Remember? Remember when the Wii first came out and all the quote unquote old folks could play Wii bowling in their retirement homes?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Like, that stuff was no joke.

25:06.000 --> 25:15.000
So, you know, maybe this is a console with a retro edge in mind that will cater to people that I don't necessarily think have to be 50.

25:15.000 --> 25:21.000
Caijudo, you're in the danger zone now because I'm 40 and I remember the Intellivision, so watch it.

25:22.000 --> 25:28.000
But anyway, let's see, I'm also looking at chat at live.vognetware.com.

25:28.000 --> 25:34.000
Dungeonbuster in chat says Sega secured a partnership with a company in Brazil that allowed them to manufacture the hardware.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
They're giving them a huge advantage early on.

25:36.000 --> 25:42.000
That's why the Genesis exploded there and is still being sold because they're literally still making them.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Very, very interesting.

25:44.000 --> 25:50.000
So, I don't know if the Intellivision is going to have international distribution, but I certainly think this could be something that would be very appealing.

25:50.000 --> 25:58.000
And if Tommy Tallarico is selling out soccer stadiums in all these countries, surely he's thinking about that in the back of his mind with these consoles.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
We'll see.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Yeah, we'll see. We'll see.

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
Anyway, alright, I guess that's enough about this console, especially when we don't really have screenshots of games yet.

26:07.000 --> 26:13.000
But, you know, I'm not going to write it off as, oh, it's just, you know, garbage because they have all these rules and boundaries.

26:13.000 --> 26:22.000
I'm interested. I think this is unique, but I'm not expecting this to be the type of games that are going to, like, blow my fucking mind.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
But, maybe I will be pleasantly surprised.

26:25.000 --> 26:38.000
I would be perfectly happy if it was, like, retro-style Atari 2600 and Intellivision grates that are now, like, online with leaderboard support, which, honestly, we kind of had with GameTap, which has been gone for how long.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
So, I would like to see a console kind of bring something like that back. I think it would be pretty awesome.

26:42.000 --> 26:51.000
So, anyway, let's move on. We got to get into this week's news, and I think we should also get into a little bit of how was your gaming week and what type of video games have you been playing this week.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Loki, we'll start with you. How was your gaming week?

26:53.000 --> 27:02.000
I've been playing Pokemon Go a little bit. I did the community day stuff today. I evolved a shiny and a non-shiny.

27:02.000 --> 27:23.000
And, what else? Oh, DDR. I've been playing lots of DDR because I have been. I've got my setup finally done. Well, I wouldn't say done. It's set up. I did a test stream yesterday, and I've got the two cameras and the video capture working.

27:23.000 --> 27:40.000
The game music was a little loud, so I needed to turn that down a bit. It's still adjusting volume levels and stuff, but it's working okay. I think I may cut the back camera because no one wants to stare at my ass while I'm playing the game. I mean, honestly.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Or, like, point it down at the arrows.

27:42.000 --> 27:54.000
Well, I already have one pointed down at the arrows. The front camera is. So, what I'm actually thinking of doing instead is maybe cutting that camera and doing my heart rate monitor instead.

27:54.000 --> 28:14.000
I challenged myself during that to actually play all the difficult non-stop courses with the random ones. Normally, I just stick to the standard difficulty stuff, but I decided to play everything on the heavy difficulties.

28:14.000 --> 28:34.000
Apparently, I am not exactly used to that, so that was fun watching my heart rate monitor. It's like, oh, hey, we're up at 170 now. I feel very tired. But, yeah, it worked out okay. It's still kind of rough, but I'm going to hopefully start doing that a little bit more.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
That's it?

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
That's pretty much it.

28:37.000 --> 28:47.000
Let's see, my gaming week. I also did a lot of Pokemon Go. I did Community Day today. I got 11 shinies. That's the best I've ever done on the shiny stuff. Sadly, none of them were any good.

28:47.000 --> 29:00.000
But I figure with trading now, one thing I can try doing, and sadly you're limited to one a day because they're shinies, but try to trade, like, a crappy shiny for the same crappy shiny for somebody else, but when you trade the IV shuffle, right?

29:00.000 --> 29:07.000
And you might get really lucky and get a lucky Pokemon. Or sometimes you get unlucky with those lucky Pokemons.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
Unlucky Pokemon. Even worse.

29:10.000 --> 29:29.000
I was trading for distance because I had, like, a Meowth from, like, or no, no, it was the other way around. I traded some garbage from here in Sacramento. I don't think it was garbage, though. I think I traded, like, I don't know, it was something like a, like one of the starters, like maybe like a Chimchar or something, one of the new ones.

29:29.000 --> 29:43.000
And I traded it to Allen for his New Hampshire Meowth, right? And they traded, and because he hatched to any guy out of New Hampshire, and that came over lucky. So it's like, what am I going to do with a lucky Meowth? A lowland Meowth.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
What won't you do with that?

29:45.000 --> 29:56.000
They're not that great Pokemon. But I've also really liked that. So now what I've started doing, because I still, I still have tons of Unowns from Dragon Con. I still have them all in my inventory.

29:56.000 --> 30:09.000
So, like the other night, I was hanging out with some of the Ingress crew, because I was playing Ingress as well. And one of the gals, I hadn't given an Unown yet. And she said, well, what do you want in exchange? And I'm like, just not a Pidgey or not.

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
Because I learned that lesson when Delvin was here, we traded an Unown for a Pidgey and my ass ended up with a lucky Pidgey.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Lucky Pidgey.

30:15.000 --> 30:31.000
So she was like, okay, I'll give you something you could actually use just in case. And she gave me a Chansey with low IVs. So it was a crappy Chansey for her. And I gave her the Unown and guess what? They went lucky because the Chansey was really old.

30:31.000 --> 30:41.000
So I got a Wonder Chansey because when they're lucky, their IVs are guaranteed to be high. And she got a Wonder Unown, which is pretty cool out of the deal. So yeah, that was, that was cool.

30:41.000 --> 30:55.000
So now I have a Wonder Blissey. So, but she had named it Frank the Tank. And I think I named it too Bad Janet. I changed the name. So there, cause there's not, I guess when they're going to get hit with a Nerf bat here, when they do the CP reshuffling, she's not going to be very much of a tank anymore.

30:55.000 --> 31:07.000
So, um, yeah, so I just named her Bad Janet because that was the, that was the image I had in my mind. So I was able to do a raid today. I got, did you, I got in a low in, uh, Raichu cause I didn't have one of those.

31:07.000 --> 31:14.000
Um, I don't know. I need to do more raids cause the game tells me I need to do more raids.

31:14.000 --> 31:21.000
I have to do that. And then, um, I don't know.

31:21.000 --> 31:28.000
Yeah, just pretty much, um, trying to catch as many of the Beldums as I could.

31:28.000 --> 31:35.000
Yeah, just, we were around Capitol Park, just everywhere trying to get them. Uh, sadly I got 11, Alan got two.

31:35.000 --> 31:47.000
And he, you know, you usually want three from a shiny day so you can have one of each evolution. That's what most people go for. So of course I gave, cause I'm a nice guy, I gave Alan one of my many extra shinies just so he could have his three.

31:47.000 --> 31:52.000
But you know, that is kind of crappy that it's so off balance where I can get 11 and he can get two.

31:52.000 --> 31:57.000
Most of mine were just caught with the gotcha. Like anything I tried catching wasn't shiny.

31:57.000 --> 32:06.000
The best community day so far in my opinion was the Squirtle one because the quest rewards could be shiny Squirtles if you knew where to go.

32:06.000 --> 32:11.000
And so that way everybody was guaranteed like at least a set number of shiny Squirtles. I thought that was the best.

32:11.000 --> 32:23.000
I wish this was done on Saturday, not Sunday because I was ready. Like in fact I didn't read the day because normally they're on Saturdays and I was like, okay, I'm ready. Uh, I don't see any.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
I had to check at the end, I'm like, ah man, it's tomorrow.

32:25.000 --> 32:40.000
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, dead game. You know, as a funny aside, I was sitting at a Starbucks the other night waiting for a friend and there was this table next to me and there were these three older people that could have come from Kaijuto's Intellivision old folks home.

32:40.000 --> 32:49.000
There was, they weren't that old, but they were, you know, they were, they were mature in love and life because I could clearly see these three individuals were all playing Pokemon Go.

32:49.000 --> 32:54.000
Cause you know, you know, if you've watched somebody or you've played Pokemon Go, you could tell they were playing, throwing curve balls.

32:54.000 --> 33:00.000
They're like drawing that little circle on their phone and you know, throwing the whole thing. Like nobody does that to their phone unless they're playing Pokemon Go.

33:00.000 --> 33:06.000
That's not, unless you want to make a joke about old people sending text messages. That's not what they were doing. Okay. They were clearly playing Pokemon Go.

33:06.000 --> 33:15.000
So I actually said, I kind of made a joke. I was like, oh, you guys are playing Pokemon Go as well. And the one, you know, lady just lit up and she's like, oh yes, we love Pokemon Go so much.

33:15.000 --> 33:22.000
And we just got my sister involved. Why don't, I've never seen you at a raid. What's your name? Do you raid around here? And this was at a Starbucks near my work.

33:22.000 --> 33:35.000
So I don't usually raid there, uh, because I go home and I raid usually in this area. Um, so I didn't know this lady, but you know, we, we, so I connected with this lady that was older on Pokemon Go, which is interesting.

33:35.000 --> 33:52.000
I'm not used to talking to folks 20 years older than I am about video games. I don't remember doing that when I was younger. So that's kind of, you know, interesting little thing about the world that's different now, I suppose. So, um, anyway, Bobby.

33:52.000 --> 34:03.000
Oh my God. Horrible comment in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and this comment came straight out of the mouth of black Wolf saying she'll be dead soon. Just like that game.

34:03.000 --> 34:14.000
That's a horrible thing to say. I'm sorry. You're must be referring to like ingress. Yeah, exactly. You click. Yeah, you're free ingress. Uh, dungeon buster says that got dark real fast.

34:14.000 --> 34:32.000
Yeah. Bobby dark sided Wolf anyway. Or maybe like, you know, Garfield go anyway. Shut up. All right. Uh, other stuff I play, I played more than what you want to go cause I played world of Warcraft working on my monk, uh, just about to hit level 60, which has been, you know, fun, uh, playing my monk and leveling that up.

34:32.000 --> 34:42.000
And, uh, I've been playing some more with friends online a little bit. I got into Delvin's Guild with that character. So, you know, at least I, I'm not alone on there. So just trying to make my way to max level.

34:42.000 --> 34:51.000
Um, and I was toying around with potentially starting a mage on there as well. Uh, and maybe using my boost to do that. Cause I don't know if I want to tank everything at a high level and we'll see.

34:51.000 --> 35:06.000
Um, and then, um, also I was, I was walking around, uh, downtown, uh, the other night and I ended up at the, uh, the bar that has all the old arcade games, you know, the coin op. Yeah. And, uh, I played around immortal combat too.

35:06.000 --> 35:20.000
And I'm so happy that to this day I can still remember how to do Katana's fatality. It's very easy. If you don't remember Katana's fatality, you just mash the block button cause you have to hit it like three or four or five times. I don't remember how many times.

35:20.000 --> 35:27.000
But you have to hit the block button like four times. So you just hit the mash the block button and then hit high kick. And that's how she chops off the person's head with their fan.

35:27.000 --> 35:36.000
And I remember that all these years later. So I was able to, uh, do fatalities on a Mortal Kombat 2 machine this week. I also played a fancy new, uh, pinball machine called Houdini.

35:37.000 --> 35:49.000
Very fancy. It was a, I don't know the company that makes all these newer games. I wish Jamie was here to, to tell me, maybe somebody in chat knows, but they, they must've done the, the new Batman, uh, sixties series table as well.

35:49.000 --> 35:59.000
And I think they have a Star Wars table. Like they all have these like video screens in the back instead of dot matrix things. Yeah. And so this new one's called Houdini and it was a very flashy machine.

35:59.000 --> 36:06.000
Uh, even though like really taunted me when I wasn't doing very well. Oh, Blackwell says it's Stern that does those machines. Oh, that's pretty cool.

36:06.000 --> 36:16.000
Uh, hit stun says Jersey Jack. I think they do the Wizard of Oz one. I don't know if they did this one. So I think, um, oh, Blackwell says Houdini is by American pinball.

36:16.000 --> 36:24.000
I guess I think pinball is making somewhat of a retro comeback. Um, just, you know, I know there's, you know, the various collectors, obviously we hear Jamie talk about it on the show a lot.

36:24.000 --> 36:31.000
And I think just, you know, in general, there's, there's very much a scene for that. So it's kind of neat, but otherwise that was really my gaming week. I didn't play.

36:31.000 --> 36:37.000
I wanted to get Soul Calibur six, but I just didn't get around to it this weekend. I was a little bit busy, so I did end up picking that up.

36:37.000 --> 36:45.000
But that's still on my agenda for this week is to pick up Soul Calibur six. Cause, uh, I I'm seeing all the character creator things people are doing and I've just always enjoyed this whole caliber series.

36:45.000 --> 36:57.000
So I want to pick that game up. So, all right, we're going to get into some gaming news for the night. Uh, I, after I do some housekeeping of which I don't think I have a lot of stuff to announce right now.

36:57.000 --> 37:05.000
We will be missing a show in November. I want to say it's like November 17th or so, uh, because I will be in Las Vegas at Final Fantasy Fan Fest.

37:05.000 --> 37:13.000
And I won't be back in time because we're driving back on Sunday. And in order to be back in time for the show, we would have to leave Las Vegas by 8 AM.

37:13.000 --> 37:21.000
I'm going to tell you right now, it's not going to happen. So, uh, no show, uh, that weekend. So you can, uh, plan accordingly.

37:21.000 --> 37:27.000
So anyway, uh, let's get into, I hear Mr. Smoosh screaming in the background, so I'm going to go see what the hell's his problem is.

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
And while Loki starts to get into some gaming news for tonight.

37:31.000 --> 37:40.000
Yes. So one of my favorite series is actually coming out again here pretty soon, um, with the sequel of Red Dead Redemption.

37:40.000 --> 37:51.000
So Red Dead Redemption 2. And of course, Rockstar was in the news this week because, you know, getting ready for the launch of Red Dead Redemption 2 has caused a bit of crunch time.

37:51.000 --> 38:02.000
And they were talking about, I guess, this was during an article published in New York Magazine about, um, you know, how they were working 100 hour weeks, you know, getting ready for the game.

38:02.000 --> 38:13.000
You know, the polishing, rewrites, uh, reedits, um, are, does, uh, the Rockstar does arm ends. We were working 100 hour weeks.

38:13.000 --> 38:21.000
Um, we probably made 70 versions, but the editors, uh, make several hundred.

38:21.000 --> 38:31.000
Uh, Sam and I will both make a lot of suggestions as well as other members of the team talking about, uh, the different TV commercials and trailers and stuff that they shot as well.

38:31.000 --> 38:39.000
Um, some of the work they did during those 100 hour weeks, 300,000 animations, 500,000 lines of dialogue, and lots of code.

38:39.000 --> 38:55.000
Um, of course, recently, studios have come under fire because of these really crunch time periods where kind of the whole morale of the workforce is low because they're being forced to work these immense hours.

38:55.000 --> 39:02.000
Um, not exactly good for the employees, but necessary, I guess, to release the game on time.

39:02.000 --> 39:12.000
Um, so because of that, there's been lots of developers speaking out about it. In fact, I guess there was some ban on social media talking about these hours as well.

39:13.000 --> 39:19.000
So, um, some of the feedback people were leaving on Twitter and Facebook, for example.

39:19.000 --> 39:25.000
Uh, one's from Keith Thorburn, who he works in the music department at Rockstar North.

39:25.000 --> 39:32.000
He's saying, first off, this was one of the most rewarding and least stressful projects that I worked on.

39:32.000 --> 39:38.000
I know what an epic crunch feels like, but this was managed in such a way that I felt happy and healthy.

39:38.000 --> 39:51.000
And then, of course, um, you know, there, there's a comment from Dan Houser, who is the head of, um, you know, Rockstar, basically saying, you know, um, we were, you know, kind of referring back to those.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
We don't ask or expect anyone to work anything like that.

39:55.000 --> 40:04.000
Um, it sounds like more that the team was kind of motivated to work these hours because of the hard work that they put into it.

40:05.000 --> 40:12.000
There's peer pressure a lot with this stuff, too. You know, it's like, oh, you're not going to work overtime? Okay.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Yeah.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
We'll see how that goes for you when review time comes around.

40:15.000 --> 40:22.000
Well, like another coder, Phil Beveridge, he's saying, you know, in the time that I've been with the studio, work practices have definitely improved.

40:22.000 --> 40:33.000
Crunch on Red Dead Redemption 2 has definitely been a lot better than it was on GTA 5, where I was pulling a month of 70 plus hour work weeks, um, while being told by my boss at the time to go home.

40:33.000 --> 40:40.000
Um, I've never worked more than, and then of course, there's another guy, uh, or woman, I should say Vivian Langdon.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
She's a tools programmer.

40:42.000 --> 40:47.000
So she's saying I've never worked more than maybe 50 hours a week.

40:47.000 --> 40:52.000
And that's a rare occurrence by generally work about two to six hours of paid overtime per week.

40:52.000 --> 41:02.000
So it sounds like that it's not so much like, oh my God, I hate working here, but it's that they, they treat their employees well, which I imagine with the amount of money that they bring in.

41:02.000 --> 41:09.000
Like, especially from like Grand Theft Auto 5, they probably can do that, but I know that's not always the same with other studios.

41:09.000 --> 41:17.000
I mean, hell, just recently with Telltale Games, we were hearing about, you know, just kind of the shit that they were putting their employees through.

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
And you know, now with all this lack of severance and everything, that kind of sucks.

41:21.000 --> 41:27.000
Um, and then of course, the, this also applies to the QA testers as well.

41:27.000 --> 41:36.000
So they were basically saying that the Rockstar QA studio was told that overtime is optional after they, the workers were saying that it felt mandatory.

41:36.000 --> 41:45.000
Through the conversations we've been having, it's clear to us that the requested scheduled overtime feels like an obligation to some, if not many of the team.

41:45.000 --> 41:51.000
We therefore spoke to them, made sure that it's clear that overtime is not mandatory.

41:51.000 --> 41:59.000
So at least it seems like they're taking some action to make sure that the workforce is not overly stressed.

41:59.000 --> 42:04.000
That's good. I guess that's more accountability than we see from some other studios.

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
But you know, I don't know if crunch time is necessarily a great thing.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
No, it's, I would think it's the result of poor planning.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
But this thing's been good. They've been developing this game for a long time.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Right!

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
I mean, I don't know.

42:16.000 --> 42:21.000
I don't know. Why does it seem like every bad news thing that happens in the industry comes back to management?

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
I mean, no wonder the employees want to unionize.

42:24.000 --> 42:29.000
And I mean, when it comes to like this crunch time stuff and all this, like I, I kind of think they deserve it.

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
I mean, I realize it gets political and people have their, you know, feelings about it.

42:33.000 --> 42:40.000
But like when this is just this recurring theme over and over and over again, like I can't help but like ask the question, like, how is this being managed?

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
Like, why aren't you planning for enough hours or why aren't you staffing adequately?

42:44.000 --> 42:50.000
Well, money. We all know that. To, uh, you'll be, be, have enough time to do these things.

42:50.000 --> 42:57.000
I gotta tell you though, if you're feeling really stressed out being a tester at Rockstar Games, you can always go work for Bethesda because those testers don't work very long hours at all.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Stop it. Because you know.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
I know they do. I know they work hard.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
You know those testers find stuff that management doesn't fix.

43:04.000 --> 43:09.000
They work hard. They find all of the bugs but they just don't fucking care because they're Bethesda and they gotta release the game and we love them.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
And it becomes self-parody at some point. Exactly.

43:12.000 --> 43:20.000
So, um, all this news though, you as the gamer, the consumer, uh, you, you could care less and are still gonna get Red Dead Redemption 2, right?

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
Yes.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
I'm part of the problem.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
Maybe that's the problem at the end of the day. Who knows.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Uh, go into some more comments in our chat over.

43:28.000 --> 43:33.000
I gotta tell Rockstar Games to stop making such good games. You know, maybe focus more on, um, some Table Tennis games.

43:33.000 --> 43:40.000
Live.vog.net.org.com. Bobby kind of reinforcing there. The testers do care. They report it. The managers decide not to fix.

43:40.000 --> 43:44.000
That is kind of what I was trying to get out there between Loki's little, little fucking around.

43:44.000 --> 43:50.000
Uh, Sia Tabiri in chat says, I mean it could be that they're looking for such specific qualities they won't hire new people.

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
I've known some managers to have that kind of struggle. You know what though?

43:54.000 --> 44:02.000
To not plan. To have a plan to replace. And maybe this is just my passion because I do a lot of like training for a living.

44:02.000 --> 44:08.000
If you don't have a plan on how you're gonna replace your good people and how you can train people on those unique skill sets.

44:08.000 --> 44:15.000
You are setting yourself up for fucking failure. Because there is nothing you can do if somebody, especially in California, it's an at-will state.

44:15.000 --> 44:22.000
There are no contracts. The Powerball, no the Mega Millions is 1.6 billion dollars.

44:22.000 --> 44:27.000
If your employee wins the Mega Millions or, you know, that thing, you cannot control.

44:27.000 --> 44:33.000
They're gonna walk into that office on Monday and go, fuck you, I quit. And there is nothing you can do.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
It doesn't matter how skilled they are. There is nothing you can do.

44:36.000 --> 44:43.000
So if you don't have a plan, that's your problem as a manager. You as a manager need to have that plan.

44:43.000 --> 44:49.000
So, I mean, in my opinion, that is still a fault of the management if the skills are too specialized.

44:49.000 --> 44:54.000
Now I'm not saying that employees with special skill sets aren't valuable. Of course they are.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
And that's why, you know, that type of seniority and that stuff should be rewarded too.

44:57.000 --> 45:01.000
But if you're not planning to lose that, because you don't know.

45:01.000 --> 45:08.000
I mean, you know, I'm joking about Mega Millions, but somebody could, I don't want to be dark, but somebody could suddenly pass away.

45:08.000 --> 45:14.000
There's nothing you can do about it. Somebody could get pregnant and they have the right to go out for so many weeks under law for FMLA and baby bonding and all that stuff.

45:14.000 --> 45:19.000
You know, if you don't have a plan, you're a bad manager. So, anyway.

45:19.000 --> 45:27.000
And see, Tiberi does, you know, qualify that saying. I'm not saying it's justified. Oh, no, no, I'm not saying you were, but I just want to make sure that kind of point is clear.

45:27.000 --> 45:33.000
Is that, you know, if these guys, I'm sure these guys are very skilled at Rockstar's systems and software and all that stuff.

45:33.000 --> 45:40.000
But if Rockstar doesn't have a way to at least get new people and ramp up to that same sort of skill set, then they're just setting themselves up for failure.

45:40.000 --> 45:46.000
So, anyway. Gaming unions, you think it's something we're going to see in the next few years?

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Maybe. I don't think so, though.

45:48.000 --> 45:54.000
I think if this Telltale thing doesn't make it happen, I'm not sure anything will. After what those guys all went through.

45:55.000 --> 45:59.000
But you'll notice it's now been about two weeks and people aren't really talking about that anymore.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
Well, this isn't necessarily a new thing either.

46:02.000 --> 46:09.000
A friendly reminder from Orange Lounge Radio. Bad management at Telltale fucked over a lot of people unnecessarily.

46:09.000 --> 46:17.000
Just a friendly reminder in case you forgot. Two weeks ago, that was a big thing. So, never forget. Bad management fucked over all those people unnecessarily.

46:18.000 --> 46:27.000
Anyhow. I feel I feel like we need like PSAs here at Orange Lounge Radio.

46:27.000 --> 46:36.000
Also, there was a massive leak with many of what was it? What was the credit card monitoring company?

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Oh, you mean like Equifax?

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Remember that?

46:40.000 --> 46:44.000
Yeah. Friendly reminder. Equifax lacked leaked all your credit information.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
And Facebook several times.

46:46.000 --> 46:54.000
That's right. Yep. Friendly reminder that Super Smash Brothers got delayed several times and you didn't care because the game came out actually really good.

46:56.000 --> 47:01.000
Hitstun in chat says, sadly bad management is not news. It's too common.

47:01.000 --> 47:07.000
Oh, I'm sure everybody has a story in their life where at one point or another they worked for a bad manager.

47:07.000 --> 47:11.000
I mean, that's just that's just part of the big wide world out there, isn't it?

47:11.000 --> 47:18.000
Alright. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says Grand Theft Auto 4 was delayed for a long time and nobody cares now.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
So, anyway.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
I cared greatly then.

47:22.000 --> 47:27.000
But you don't now because you ended up being like one of the top 100 players in the world at Grand Theft Auto 4.

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
That's why I cared because I wanted to play right away.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
Alright.

47:32.000 --> 47:39.000
We were playing the PSP version in Saints Row. That's right. I was one of the dozens that were playing Saints Row multiplayer online.

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
Can we talk about cat that drama for a minute? Like, I just.

47:43.000 --> 47:48.000
OK, so Mr. Smoosh is out here screaming. So I gave him some little kibble. I don't even think it's feeding time. Alan doesn't even know I gave him kibble.

47:48.000 --> 47:52.000
So I gave him a little kibble and I filled up his water bowl completely because it was looking a little.

47:52.000 --> 47:56.000
And now it's been that held him over for five minutes and now he's back out here yelling again.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
That's cats.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Y'all.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
That's why our cat tries to wake us up at like five in the morning.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
No, that. No, no.

48:05.000 --> 48:09.000
And she and she wants a treat. She's like, I treats. And I'm like, I'm throwing your ass in the garage.

48:09.000 --> 48:14.000
That's that's that's why we I sleep with earplugs and we shut the door.

48:14.000 --> 48:18.000
So she'll scratch the door. And if she doesn't wake us up, she'll go wake the kids up.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
That's so I like you fucking asshole.

48:22.000 --> 48:28.000
She'll do that, too. Like it could be just like at random, like just I have to remind you that I'm an asshole.

48:28.000 --> 48:33.000
Like, you know, you'll be sitting there watching TV. She's curled up in your lap. You're petting her.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
She's like enjoying life. She's getting full attention.

48:36.000 --> 48:41.000
She'll just get up, stretch out, hop down, go scratch at the door of the kids.

48:41.000 --> 48:46.000
I'm like, what the fuck is your problem? Why the fuck are you doing this?

48:46.000 --> 48:52.000
I was paying attention to you a hundred percent and you have to go and be an asshole.

48:52.000 --> 48:59.000
All right. Speaking of assholes, I see a lot of them on Facebook. How do you like that transition?

48:59.000 --> 49:05.000
Let's talk about Facebook for a minute. Facebook. Did you know Facebook has a whole gaming platform built into it?

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
It's something called instant games. I just got my block all that shit.

49:08.000 --> 49:17.000
I got my first one today because one of my friends posted a thing that was like, come look at my rap album that, you know, it's like one of those meme quiz things.

49:17.000 --> 49:23.000
And so I tapped on it and it was like, do you want to install OMG? No, no, no.

49:23.000 --> 49:33.000
It's like this application will receive your name, your real name, your mailing address, your friends list, your privacy, your blood, your semen sample.

49:33.000 --> 49:40.000
I'm like, good Lord. Why does this game need everything? It's crazy.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
We already have it.

49:42.000 --> 49:49.000
So anyway, so instant games is a thing and unfortunately this is only going to get bigger.

49:49.000 --> 49:56.000
Now, I don't see where like, see my rap album was supposed to be a big game unless I missed out on karaoke or something.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
I don't know. Maybe that's the thing.

49:57.000 --> 50:08.000
But apparently Facebook games is now also coming to Facebook groups and the Facebook light app because, you know, Facebook isn't confident enough just having one app on your phone.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
You have to have a separate message. Well, you don't have to do anything.

50:11.000 --> 50:17.000
And I know many of you don't. But, you know, if you want to be able to talk to people and stuff, you have to have the Facebook Messenger app on your phone.

50:17.000 --> 50:24.000
You have to have the Facebook groups thing to manage pages. You have to have the, like, because one app isn't enough, Facebook wants to have all these apps on your phone.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
And now they're putting this gaming platform on all of them.

50:27.000 --> 50:36.000
So anyhow, the future will be available to all gaming groups if your group is flagged as like a gaming related thing, meaning members can play with each other.

50:36.000 --> 50:40.000
They are playing with a feature to make it opt in for all groups.

50:40.000 --> 50:45.000
Anyhow, they're saying that they're seeing an increase with active players and all this other stuff.

50:45.000 --> 50:49.000
And I'm like, who's playing these games? I'm sure not. But I do, I mean,

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Is Farmville still a thing?

50:51.000 --> 50:57.000
I don't, I think it is still a thing, but it's not like the thing it used to be.

50:57.000 --> 51:08.000
But I mean, you know, for better or for worse, and oftentimes when it comes to Facebook, mostly worse, you can pull up a game right into the Facebook app.

51:08.000 --> 51:14.000
And it's like you're not downloading a separate app or anything. It's like basically like you're playing like the Flash game or whatever, but on your phone.

51:14.000 --> 51:18.000
You know, the one I do remember playing in Messenger was like a Pac-Man thing.

51:18.000 --> 51:26.000
And it actually, you could see like your ranking against other players in the group, but like the people in my messaging group, like nobody else wanted to play it.

51:26.000 --> 51:33.000
And it's just Pac-Man. It's not like we're playing it at the same time or anything like that. I don't know.

51:33.000 --> 51:37.000
Anyhow, Facebook gaming, it's still a thing, believe it or not.

51:37.000 --> 51:44.000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Let's see. You know what's funny? I thought this was a comment about Facebook.

51:44.000 --> 51:50.000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, yeah, sounds like my dogs. They go crazy for a biscuit and five minutes later they want another one.

51:50.000 --> 51:54.000
I seriously thought that was a comment about Facebook and all of its apps.

51:54.000 --> 51:58.000
And not a comment about Mr. Smoosh.

51:58.000 --> 52:02.000
But I mean, if it fits, apply it, right?

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
If it fits, it's no.

52:06.000 --> 52:14.000
Sia Tabiri in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, friendly for Facebook when you want to filter out 60% of your friends' feeds.

52:14.000 --> 52:18.000
And Dungeon Buster says, in a way it kind of makes sense with Facebook. Exactly.

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
Install my new app. Meow, meow, meow. Install my new app. Meow, meow, meow.

52:22.000 --> 52:27.000
You can't talk with your friends unless you do a new app. Meow, meow, meow.

52:27.000 --> 52:33.000
Are you sure you don't want to give us your blood type? Because we might need to know your blood type.

52:33.000 --> 52:37.000
Meow, meow, meow. Or like, where do you work? We need to know where you work. Where'd you go to school?

52:37.000 --> 52:41.000
Where are you right now? I can see you, but where are you?

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
We're noticing that you're at a fancy restaurant right now with somebody who isn't your spouse.

52:45.000 --> 52:50.000
Do you wish to check in here and write a review?

52:50.000 --> 52:55.000
And tell all your friends you were here? I fucking hate Google Maps does that shit sometimes.

52:55.000 --> 53:01.000
We're like, I'll be at the park. It's like, do you know something about this park?

53:01.000 --> 53:06.000
Like, fill in some data for us. I'm like, fuck off. I'm just trying to get directions somewhere.

53:06.000 --> 53:11.000
The thing that gets me is I'll go somewhere and I'll just open Facebook to like check my feed or something.

53:11.000 --> 53:16.000
Albeit like a store. And then like a day later, I see ads for the store I was in.

53:16.000 --> 53:21.000
And I wasn't even doing anything on Facebook with it. I didn't check in there or anything like that. Nope. Facebook just knew I was there.

53:21.000 --> 53:29.000
Yeah, my wife insists, and I've heard a lot of people insist as well, that she was talking with her friend about something.

53:29.000 --> 53:34.000
And not even like didn't bring it up in Facebook or whatever. And all of a sudden just started receiving ads about it.

53:34.000 --> 53:40.000
And they claim they're not listening. They claim that. Just like they claim that the data hasn't been breached.

53:40.000 --> 53:44.000
To the extent that it was. But they're fucking liars.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
Do you think Zuckerberg's listening to this right now?

53:47.000 --> 53:53.000
Because they have fucking liar money is what they have. They have money where it's like, oh, we need to pay a fine.

53:53.000 --> 53:58.000
Here's the fine money. And we're just going to keep doing what the fuck we were doing before because we make a lot more money to offset it.

53:59.000 --> 54:05.000
All right. Let's take off the tinfoil hats, although, I mean, are they tinfoil if what we're saying is pretty much true.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
Let's move on to some more news. Loki.

54:08.000 --> 54:17.000
So much like we got the high end, you know, analog, was it? I remember it's called like Super NT, analog NT.

54:17.000 --> 54:26.000
Anyways, now we're going to be getting the Mega SG, which is a high end Sega system.

54:26.000 --> 54:35.000
So it's going to play Genesis, Mega Drive, Master System games, outputting all the video from them with 10 AP and zero latency.

54:35.000 --> 54:41.000
It's supposed to be coming out April twenty nineteen. It's going to retail for one hundred and ninety dollars.

54:41.000 --> 54:50.000
And they're saying that they're even going to have add ons to play, I think, Sega CD, which is ridiculous.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
Yeah, Sega CD or Mega CD games.

54:54.000 --> 55:01.000
So neat that you can do that. And then they have also other cartridge adapters that plug in.

55:01.000 --> 55:06.000
So you can even use looks like Game Gear and.

55:06.000 --> 55:15.000
I can't really tell what else is in there. Oh, Game Gear, Sega, my card, SG 1000 and SC 3000.

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
Not familiar with those systems, but needs.

55:19.000 --> 55:24.000
I mean, I don't have a need for this, but it's cool that it's a thing.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
Sure. Why not? All the retro consoles. Why not?

55:27.000 --> 55:31.000
I mean, now you got to find one just take a Genesis games and stuff to play.

55:31.000 --> 55:36.000
Speaking of retro consoles, one of my friends on Facebook got one of those Commodore 64 minis.

55:36.000 --> 55:40.000
Yeah. And I was like, oh, how are this? Because I've kind of heard mixed reviews on them.

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
I kind of I kind of want one, even though the reviews are kind of mixed.

55:43.000 --> 55:50.000
And yes, I know damn well I can do the same thing with a Raspberry Pi and all that shit.

55:50.000 --> 55:54.000
It's a collector's item. Exactly. It's a collector's item and I want it.

55:54.000 --> 56:00.000
Anyway, even if the games that are included are apparently not really the best ones, but it is what it is.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Can't you hack that thing to put the other ones on there? Oh, I'm sure you can.

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
In fact, I think I think actually the sideloading is like wide open.

56:05.000 --> 56:09.000
I think that thing fully embraces D64 images probably.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
We know you're going to do this anyway.

56:10.000 --> 56:15.000
Well, well, and also because the technology at this point is so old, it's from the 80s.

56:15.000 --> 56:20.000
I'm pretty sure any type of trademark or patent has probably fallen off at least the disk type.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
So if people want to do it, they're going to do it. You know what I mean?

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Yep. So.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
All right. Well, moving on to some new things.

56:26.000 --> 56:30.000
Some of you might be picking up Diablo three on the switch.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
I let's I'm not going to try to lie.

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
Like I'll probably end up being one of them, even though I already own this game.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
You'll tease me for Mass Effect three when I buy that.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
But this will be like the third or fourth platform I bought.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
I can't even remember.

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
You'll buy Mass Effect again when this comes out on the switch.

56:44.000 --> 56:49.000
If if they do a Mass Effect remastered trilogy, you bet your ass I'm going to buy it again.

56:49.000 --> 56:55.000
Absolutely. But anyway, Diablo three is, of course, coming out on the switch.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
And you know, why? Why stop at just doing a mere port?

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
You know, Nintendo and Blizzard.

57:00.000 --> 57:06.000
You know, Nintendo really loves that Blizzard is crawling into their bed a little bit by putting out Diablo three on the system.

57:06.000 --> 57:09.000
Oh goody, what amiibo support are we getting now?

57:09.000 --> 57:16.000
Well, I think it's more like Nintendo is like, if you will put Overwatch on this console, like we will give you favors.

57:16.000 --> 57:20.000
You know, like I think Nintendo would love to have something like Overwatch.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
Tracer and Smash.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Even.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
You should watch those things that come out of your mouth.

57:26.000 --> 57:32.000
All right. Anyway, I'm going on into I don't think that would really happen, but fucking you never know.

57:32.000 --> 57:41.000
Anyway, I'm going to a story about Diablo three and the special limited edition console that's going to come out on November 2nd.

57:41.000 --> 57:47.000
So it's the Diablo three eternal collection is the game, of course, that's coming on November 2nd.

57:47.000 --> 57:57.000
You can get a whole hoopla thing for three hundred fifty nine bucks with a Nintendo switch dock that features Diablo three artwork.

57:57.000 --> 58:01.000
You can get a carrying case that features Diablo three art.

58:01.000 --> 58:06.000
So if you want to look like you're carrying Satan with you everywhere you go, which some of you do.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
Yes.

58:07.000 --> 58:11.000
Then then you can have your you know, your whole like switch themed case.

58:11.000 --> 58:18.000
I'd actually I'd buy the case if they sold it separately, although my I have a Mario Kart eight case right now that's pretty solid.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
But I would pick this up maybe if they sold it separately.

58:20.000 --> 58:25.000
So, yeah, they're going to do a full on little bundle with a theme dock and everything.

58:25.000 --> 58:28.000
So I guess that's pretty cool. I already have a switch.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
So that's that.

58:31.000 --> 58:34.000
Apparently, Blizzard is also doing like a virtual treasure hunt, basically.

58:34.000 --> 58:38.000
They're hiding things around the Internet and real world locations.

58:38.000 --> 58:43.000
And when you find them, you might get prizes like that Nintendo switch bundle I just talked about.

58:43.000 --> 58:47.000
You might also end up with the digital copy of the game or some of the other collectible items.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
So that's kind of interesting. They're doing their whole little loot hunt.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
So you might be mugged.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
I guess it depends what real world places you want to go to.

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
You know, I was thinking about this the other day.

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
You know, Blizzard's working on some secret projects, right?

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
Of course, of course, Blizzard's working on secret projects, right?

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
And it seems less and less likely Diablo four is what they're going to announce.

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
But they're probably going to announce something Diablo.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
I don't think they're going to announce Diablo three expansion.

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
I think Diablo Diablo mobile is coming.

59:14.000 --> 59:17.000
I think that's I don't know if it's necessarily Diablo three,

59:17.000 --> 59:21.000
but it's either going to be a Diablo two remasters and be Diablo mobile.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
And I was just thinking about like, you know, Blizzard,

59:24.000 --> 59:27.000
because I think I was kind of thinking about this while I was playing Pokemon Go.

59:27.000 --> 59:32.000
Certainly Blizzard has to be thinking about what can we do in the real world?

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
Can you imagine Blizzard doing something like Pokemon Go?

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
And don't take that literally.

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
I'm not talking about collecting little orcs and things from World of Warcraft

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
or the Blizzard characters in the real world.

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
But I'm talking about imagine if Blizzard took its little touch on things

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
and did it with like AR games.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Wouldn't that be interesting?

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
I don't know.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
Sure.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
You wouldn't play a Blizzard AR game?

59:54.000 --> 59:58.000
I don't have as much love for Blizzard as a lot of people do.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
A lot of people do.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
I'm not doubting that.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
All right.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Anyway, just a few more stories for you guys,

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
But first, Loki.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
All right.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Well, this is unfortunate if you're waiting to get a copy of Starlink from Best Buy.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Apparently, it's...

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Oh, you mean Starfox?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Uh, yes.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
The game that features Starfox but is not Starfox.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
The Toys of Life game.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Yes.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Starlink Battle for Atlas had a starter kit that they sold at Best Buy.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And apparently, those copies of the game, or at least some of them,

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
were missing the game.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000
So you got the accessories, but you got no game.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
And that's a problem, because you kind of need the game to play the game.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
But apparently, Ubisoft is aware, and they're investigating,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
basically saying to you,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.000
hey, we made aware of a small amount of Starlink Battle for Atlas starter packs

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000
that we have shipped without a copy of the disc, or cartridge included.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
We are currently investigating the scope and issue of these,

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
and potential solutions for this issue.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:12.000
They were saying, of course, if you received a copy of Starlink without the game in the box,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000
contact support.ubi.com to resolve that issue.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Complain loudly on the internet about it, because that's what people do.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
We fucked up.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Dope.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.000
But, you know, I have no interest in this game, honestly.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I don't need a new Toys to Life game.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000
I need more of the ones that we have already, like more Disney Infinity.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Disney Infinity 4.0 would have been fucking awesome.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Disney Infinity is dead and gone, and it's never coming back.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
I know it's dead and gone.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Same with the LEGO game.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
It's sad.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
It is.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
But they're trying.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
They're like, we can do it.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
I just think it's going to fail.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
But Star Fox.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Star Fox ain't going to save that shit.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I'm sorry.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
It may get a few copies sold, but no one.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Then again, then again, that's like saying, Spyro Toys to Life game.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Spyro's not going to sell that shit.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
But then people are like, fucking, who the fuck is Spyro?

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
I love Skylanders, you know?

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And I'm like, you're a fucking blasphemous piece of shit.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Sia Tabarian Chat says, we need more passive aggressive people on the internet talking about not getting their games.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
That was a really good read.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Good job, chatters.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Alright.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Anyway, something that may or may not be dead and gone and never coming back, but it's certainly temporarily gone.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
NBA 2K Playgrounds, or NBA Playgrounds.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
It's gone.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
It's gone. The first game is gone.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000
The NBA Playgrounds disappeared from the Switch eShop and no word on why or if it's ever coming back.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
And nothing of value was lost.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.000
It is awfully interesting that NBA 2K Playgrounds 2 just came out.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
You can get that one just fine.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
So when the part two came out, the first one is now gone.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
That's interesting.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
What they did is they took it down and they added the number two and they put it back up.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
And updated the year in the rosters.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
And then the year in the roster.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
By golly, Loki, I think you might be onto something.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Also, speaking of games that were pulled from the Nintendo Switch eShop, a game called One Strike has been pulled.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
This one they are saying is temporary.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
It's a very interesting reason why it's been pulled.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:42.000
They found that some music was lifted from what I would call an obscure Famicom title.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
And I'm calling it obscure because it was never out over here.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
So most of you probably don't know it.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:55.000
So anyway, thanks to the magic of YouTube, we actually can hear a little bit of the music from this game which was called Morayu Senkai Madara.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000
So this was the game and this was some of the music from that game if YouTube will cooperate with it.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Not a bad soundtrack for an NES game for Famicom.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
It's a pretty good song, yeah.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
So that was the song of the game.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.000
And now here is some actual gameplay that somebody put on YouTube of them playing One Strike.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000
And if you forward to about eight minutes into this video, you hear this song in one of the menus.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Stealing is bad, UK.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
That is right. That is the exact same song, isn't it?

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000
So anyway, they were kind of called out on this on Twitter.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000
And by the way, that game I just mentioned, the Madara game, that was actually a Konami game.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
So just funny kind of aside. But anyway.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
And as we like to say, Konami will sue.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Well, not this time. Anyway, Cubic Games acknowledged the situation and says they were unaware that the music was stolen.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000
They basically said that they thought the track was original work.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
They paid a composer for the music.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000
So maybe the composer bait and switched them. Who knows?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Yeah. Dungeon Buster in chat says, hey, this game is so obscure, no one will figure it out.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Internet accepts challenge.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Dude, don't. If you think you're going to pull a fast one by stealing from some obscure NES game,

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:30.000
you're not going to get away with it because there's people out there that love, love 8-bit games that no one else loves.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
I mean, look at us in the Guardian Legend.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Now, granted, that's a little bit more mainstream of a cult title.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
I think a lot more gamers have heard of that particular game.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
But there's a lot of gamers that haven't.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
But I would not try to steal a song from the Guardian Legend and be like, oh, this game's so old.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Nobody heard of it. Nobody played it.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Because you know what? There's a lot of people that would recognize it like that.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. Like you would know that.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:57.000
So just to be clear here, because I'm not aware that he does music production on the side,

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:02.000
but the music producer wasn't, you know, Philip Musen, was it?

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
What's that?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Philip Musen?

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:11.000
No. Oh, God. Oh, no. I don't believe it was that whole thing.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Just making sure he doesn't do music production on the side.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Yes.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
With his totally original work.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
All right. Oh, my gosh.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000
So, by the way, I got distracted there for a minute because Alan just texted me the instructions.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Oh, by the way, you need to feed Mr. Smusher. He's going to scream his head off all night.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Oh, thanks.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
You don't say.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
You don't say. Thanks. Thanks for doing that before you left. All right. That's all right.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Animal needs food.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Here's the other thing. He's actually going to a movie tonight. He's going to see Halloween.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
He found a friend that will go see scary movies with him, so I don't have to.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
So that's good news.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Are you eh?

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I don't know. The Halloween series is like, OK.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
I hear the new one's all right.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Like, if you're a fan of those type of movies, I hear this new one's pretty good.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Yeah, but I'm just not I don't you know, I don't like gore.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
And, you know, Michael Myers going to chop somebody's head off and I don't see it.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
And even that trailer, he was like the teeth were falling. I was like, no, no.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Oh, no.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
All right.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Yeah.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
No, Mr. Smoosh is not going to a movie.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Yes, you and her.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Alan is going to a movie.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
All right. Anyhow, Mr. Smoosh goes to the movies.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:23.000
The brand new theatrical release coming this fall to theaters near you.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Maybe, maybe we'll give him a Twitch channel where he just sits there and watches movies, but he won't just sit there and do anything.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
That's the that's the joke.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
All right. Anyhow, already the chat room's lighting up.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I listen to that podcast.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
All right.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Let's go back to a classic time when we did not we did not stream cats watching movies on the Internet.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:53.000
We we instead spent lots and lots and lots of money on things to play one particular game.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Let's get to it with this throwback classic game of the week.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:08.000
And so we take a step into the gaming vaults, a journey back through space and time to visit with Dark Sakura, who's here in the house.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Thanks to Radio Magic.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Thanks to me going to the thrift store.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
That's right.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Did you find anything thrifty at the thrift store?

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
I don't laugh. I've always wanted an egg cobbler.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
You know what those are?

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Are those like the little things that hold porcelain?

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I think I know.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
And they have a screw top on them?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I've wanted one and they're like twenty five bucks for a good porcelain one if I wanted a thrift store for two bucks.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
The classic cookware of the week.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Classic cookware.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
I wanted an egg cobbler because I like coddled eggs.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
There you go. All right.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Just told me not to coddle them too much and they'll get mouthy.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
All right.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.000
It's the classic game of the week, but actually once a month, Dark Sakura decides, you know what?

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I'm going to do a peripheral because there's tons of like neat shit that came out for gaming.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Except now I'm like that little girl with the meme.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Why can't we do both?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
That's right porque no los dos.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Right now.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
So so the classic peripheral was not good enough for you.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
You're going to do a peripheral and a game.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Because these two you can't do one without the other.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
They are peas in a pod.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
So let's stop making the audience wait.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
What is the classic peripheral?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I guess technically.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
So you get one a month but slash game of the month.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000
It's Steel Battalion also known in Japan.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.000
And this is a game and and the peripheral I can't make words happen.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:25.000
It was developed by Capcom for the Xbox and you control a vertical tank, which is bipedal mecha kind of think metal gear.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.000
But yeah, I actually think metal gear.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
It required this massive controller to play it.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:39.000
The controller itself has two control sticks and 40 about 40 buttons.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
They only came out in limited quantities and then they sold out.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:49.000
I got an original one for Dan and they did do a rerelease, but it has blue buttons instead of green buttons.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:55.000
So that's all you can tell which one you had, which by the way, now I looked on eBay to see what they're going for.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:01.000
And while the whole set was about 200 bones together, they're going like 700 plus.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Oh, yeah.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I mean, it's not like they make these controllers anymore.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
And it was big.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.000
I mean, this thing like would fit on a desk and it came in three pieces.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
And this was an event.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
It was an experience.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
If you bought one of these, you were you were going to have an event.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Yeah. And they did actually make like some mods for it where you could like make it smaller.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:30.000
And then there were some I think people who did like aftermarket versions that were kind of OK.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:40.000
But at any rate, this is where the game part comes into it with this controller, is that it was supposed to be like this immersive.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Like well, like you were saying, an event where you are in the cockpit and you were fully immersed in the gameplay through this.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:57.000
At the start of every mission, you had to start up your mecha, which well, not just the mecha, but its operating system as well,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000
which was done through a different series of switches and buttons that were just for that.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:07.000
And if you like turn corners too quickly, you fall over.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
If your machine overheats, you have to reset your operating system.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
You have window wipers.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
So if you get hit by mud, it wipes them off.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:23.000
And the other thing, too, is that if you don't hit your eject button when your mecha is about to go boom, you die with it.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
And if you die, your save game gets deleted.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
And you have to start the fuck over.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000
No!

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Yes.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Oh my God, that eject button.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:37.000
So I remember one of my earliest memories of meeting you and Dan was that you had this brick in your house.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
And I was fascinated by the eject button.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000
I'm like, why do they need an eject button in a game?

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
This was serious business.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
This was the Dark Souls of mech games.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
The Dark Souls of peripheral movement.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Well, if you didn't hit that eject button, say goodbye to all that hard work.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Rob, imagine in Diablo.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I know, I'd cry.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000
I'd cry.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.000
As much as I love Diablo, I think that's one of those things that I like the way it's better in Path of Exile.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
If you play hardcore mode and your character dies, you simply, it drops to regular.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
You just lose your hardcore mode status.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
So I like that better.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Can you get it back?

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Nope.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I mean, as frustrating as it is, it's like you didn't completely lose your character, you know what I mean?

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Yeah.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Anyway.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Well, at any rate, as I said earlier, the vertical tanks, or VTs, are like giant metal gear things.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
They walk on two legs, they shoot shit.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
You have different types of combat roles.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000
You have assault, support, scout, and fast attack.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000
And then you have three weight classes, which is like medium and heavy.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
And so as you progress through the game, you can get different tanks.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Now, the group that developed this at Capcom, it was Capcom Production Studio 4,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
and they worked with some of the designers from Human Entertainment.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:57.000
And that it was basically focused on the product.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.000
They wanted to create a new peripheral and software designed to go with the peripheral.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000
So really, in this case, the peripheral came first, and the game followed.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.000
And it actually did, you know, the project grew while they were working on it.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.000
And the game was originally, well, the earliest build-up, it ran on PlayStation 2.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
But when the Xbox came out, they were like, oh, this thing's a little bit more hardcore, so they did it.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
They were going to do online play.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
They took it out because they thought it would be too ambitious.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
And they really didn't turn a whole lot of profit on this.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
They did make a profit on it, just not a whole lot.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:41.000
But Inaba, that's Inaba Atsushi, was the producer on it.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
And he said that the point of it wasn't for profit,

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000
but it was to show what could be done in the game industry that cannot be done in others.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000
As for ratings, Metacritic gave it an 83 out of 100.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Famitsu gave it 35 out of 40.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000
It got really, really good reviews for the most part.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Some were not so stellar, like Eurogamer and Edge gave it 6 out of 10.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
But who cares what they think?

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Who cares what they think?

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.000
I think that's notable, though, that a Japanese magazine like Famitsu enjoyed an Xbox game.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
You don't hear these stories anymore.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Yeah, well, one of the...

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000
I guess it was Capcom's game.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
It was Retro Core, I think.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000
The guy who does the Battle of the Ports that I'm so fond of

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:32.000
was talking about how he had to go special order his Xbox One in Japan.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Yeah.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
But there's a reviewer from IGN.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
I really like this quote.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
It's like,

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Accurate.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Hello, AOL.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Anyway, there were some issues playing on consoles that use the executor mod chip.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000
The ignition button would trigger the console reset function of the mod chip

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000
so you couldn't start your VT because you would just reset your system.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000
So it can be avoided by pushing fully forward on the right aiming lever

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000
and pressing the ignition key or disabling the mod chip before playing.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
So there were sequels.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
There's still Battalion, Line of Contact.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
And it also used the same controller.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000
That came out in 2004.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
By the way, this was 2002, I forgot to say.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
The third installment was still Battalion Heavy Armor.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000
And it used the Kinect instead of the original controller,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
which is pretty stupid.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
If you buy this controller, you should have more games than this.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
That's quite economical to use the Kinect instead,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
but probably not quite as impressive.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
I always just thought the Japanese name was cool.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Tekki, it just sounds cool to say.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Yeah.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Plus I like the box.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.000
I think actually even the U.S. box is stamped with it, with the kanji.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000
So that's really, that's really it.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000
The game 2002, still Battalion by Capcom.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
But of course, the controller came first.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
So you cannot talk about the controller without talking about the game.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Absolutely.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000
So there it is, your peripheral of the month slash game of the week,

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Steel Battalion, another fine choice by Dark Sakura.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
This motion sick inducing like, oh, get out.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Real quick before we get back to the show,

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
since, you know, we don't get to have you in studio, sad face,

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
outside of these special segments.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Only a few more months.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Any exciting Halloween plans?

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I'm working.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Oh, that's, that's really crappy. Sorry to hear it.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Well, I might see if I can, if I can get out.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Cause that's a couple of weeks.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.000
I'm actually getting out early on Friday and not Friday on Friday.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:50.000
I already have Fridays off on Wednesday so that I can make truffle bread.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
But I have to go on the way home.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:59.000
I have to stop by Joanne's and get black food dye.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Oh, to make scary food.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000
To make scary food.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Cause I'm not putting activated charcoal in it like a lot of these recipes call for.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Because people might not be aware of this,

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000
but activated charcoal, since it's supposed to absorb,

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
like legit absorb toxins out of your body.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Like not in that, oh, I'm getting a detox kind of way.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
But it's what they give you when you have poisoned yourself.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000
It also will absorb your vitamins. It will absorb your drugs,

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
which if someone at my work is on drugs that keep them alive,

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
I'm not going to be responsible for inhibiting that.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Wasn't the charcoal stuff the stuff that like they put in the Burger King burger

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
that was black that made everybody's poop turn blue or something like that?

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
I want to try the Burger King one that's green. It's got a green bun.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
No, no thanks. No thanks.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000
I mean, I don't really like Burger King. I like their onion rings,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
but I want to just eat the green burger so I can send a picture to my mother.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Although I did send her a wonderful picture today of a Liberace 8-track.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Oh, beautiful. Oh, at a thrift store, of course.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000
At a thrift store.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Quintessential thrift store item.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000
I almost bought it. I was going to make a wallet out of it,

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
but I was like, I'm just going to sit there going,

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
hi, I'm Liberace. I'm very gay and very dead.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
All right. We need to go back through the portal to the present time.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
But any final thoughts for our listeners for this week?

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I'm playing Pokemon Go. I'm playing a lot of Pokemon Go.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000
A lot. And I got robbed Tim Tams.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000
And the Tim Tams were delicious, I'll have you know.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Anyway, thank you very much Dark Sakura for the walk down memory lane with Steel Battalion.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000
And that, again, is like an early memory I have of going to Dark Sakura's place

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
and actually seeing that massive display.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Loki, you remember the Steel Battalion controller and seeing that whole thing?

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
That thing was amazing.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000
I remember it, yes.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Yeah. Aren't you a big mech game fan?

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Eh.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000
I thought you were kind of dizzy.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000
I didn't want to play Steel Battalion, though.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Oh, okay. Not that one.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
You want that one game to come back.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
What was that Sega game they put on 360 you really liked?

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
It was a mech game.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Oh, Virtualon? That's all right. That is coming back.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Oh, well, I guess we'll get into that later, won't we?

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.000
We will, yes.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.000
All right.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
No, the one I used to play a lot was the Battletech.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
The Virtual World Battletech games.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Yeah.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Oh, are those the ones that were at the Dave and Busters?

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000
You go in the pods.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Okay, so the ones that they still, like they still bring those basically like Dragon Combat.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000
They're rebranded now and there's a whole, Bobby did a whole show on it years ago.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Yeah.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Yeah, so like you kind of, the spirit of the whole thing lives on, but yeah.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
But you don't ever go to Dragon Combat.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Man, if they updated those games, that'd be sweet.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
You never know. You never know.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
All right, let's move on. We got some rapid fire news to get into.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Loki, starting with you.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
All right, so this is kind of cool.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:33.000
You know, there's, of course, always new backwards compatible games on Xbox One.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Well, if you happen to have the Half-Life 2, the Orange Box Collection,

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:44.000
then those games are going to be enhanced and backwards compatible with Xbox One as well.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:52.000
So you can find the X, yeah, the Portal still live, Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Those are all going to have enhanced visuals on the Xbox One X,

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:05.000
as well as the Half-Life 2 Episode 2 Team Fortress Portal and Episode 1 as well.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
And I think the original Half-Life, which were all part of the Orange Box.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
So that's neat.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Along with that, there's also other enhanced titles as well.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Including, you know, Crackdown, Assassin's Creed, and Red Dead Redemption.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
I believe those are all the older ones, so.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:27.000
I still need to get my copy of the Orange Box in the Xbox One X and check that out.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000
I mean, that was a great, that Orange Box, if I remember right,

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
that was a previous OLR game of the year, the year that came out.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
And that's just because we're both feeling orange.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000
It was a great value.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Yeah, it was an amazing value for games.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
I wish they would do that again, but they don't have enough games to put in a collection.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
The 3 Box, that's what we want, the 3 Box.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3, Half-Life 3.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
That's right, the 3 Box.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Do you know how many, oh my god, do you know, like, everybody would just,

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000
like all the gamers out there would just want to take a bus.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Dota 3.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Ahhh!

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Bleh!

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Okay, anyway.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Never going to fucking happen.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
I know, let a man dream.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Alright.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:08.000
And then, of course, unfortunately, as with most things, there's going to be delays.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.000
And Days Gone, one of the games that they showed off, at least the last few E3s.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000
I spent a lot of time on it two E3s ago, I think.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Yes, they have delayed it again.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000
So now, it was originally going to be slated for February 22nd.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Now it's coming out April 26th, 2019.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.000
And of course, as the usual goes, we've recently decided to move the release

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000
of Days Gone from the crowded February timeframe to April 26th, 2019.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000
While the studio's eager to see Days Gone in the hands of fans,

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Ben's studio will take the opportunity to further polish Days Gone.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
More polish, spit shine, you know.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:50.000
The game was not ready to go gold, so we're going to need a little more time.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Take the time.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Alright, take the time to get it right, especially with something that,

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000
you know, you've shined a very, very bright, big spotlight on

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
in a game you want to perform very well.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000
I think many of us have a different way of thinking in this day and age

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
where, you know what, if they had to delay it to get it right, then so be it.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Something you could play on your PlayStation 4 in the meantime

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000
while you're waiting for that is you could play Dream Daddy.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000
That's right, Dream Daddy.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Which, funny enough, I still haven't really played Dream Daddy.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000
I'm aware of Dream Daddy and I've seen some of it on Twitch and stuff.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
I have not played the game myself.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Maybe that's something I need to fix because there is a Dad Director's Cut,

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
which I think is like Dada, but Dad Director's Cut,

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
which is coming out for the PlayStation 4.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.000
And what's nice about this is that because it was originally out on the PC,

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:38.000
the PC version will get upgraded to the Dad Director's Cut for free,

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000
so that's pretty cool.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
So anyhow, if you don't know what Dream Daddy is,

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
it is a hunky dad dating simulator,

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:50.000
and that's kind of neat that it's coming out on PlayStation 4.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
It's a little more mainstream by doing that.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000
My question is, has anyone cosplayed these characters?

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
I did.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Oh, that's right, you did. I forgot.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Yeah, I did.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
I forgot, yeah.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
And I swear, only one group of people knew who I was

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000
because I walked by these guys and you know one of them let out the,

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
yeah, Dream Daddy.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
And that's how I knew I was recognized.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I think his name was Brian.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
It was the guy with the tank top and the corgi,

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
and I had a little stuffed corgi and I wore the green.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I did the whole thing because he had a beard too, like I do,

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
so I was like, I don't want to shave my beard,

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
so I found a character that I could do that.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
And yeah, one person got it, so that's all right.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Anyhow, let's see, in chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Rama in chat says, I know a few girls who did Dream Daddy crossplays.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Why not? Why not?

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000
All right, but do people get it without having to have it explained to them?

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.000
That's when I really enjoy the outfit.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000
And even the ones that like blend things, you know,

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000
like Deadpool but in the old Marriott carpet,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
that's like stuff that you don't have to explain.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
It's funny. Anyway.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.000
The director's cut of Dream Daddy will come out on October 30th

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
for the PlayStation 4. What's new?

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000
There's a new jogging minigame, more side quests,

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
and other content that was previously cut, so you can check that out.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Moving on to news about Rocket League.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
We know that Rocket League is going to be getting crossplay soon,

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000
but not that soon.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.000
The developers of the game are saying that it's going to be coming out in 2019.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000
The goal was to release Rocket ID before the end of 2018.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000
The studio said.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000
But we've made the difficult decision to put this release into early 2019.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000
The good news is that with Sony's recent announcements

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
regarding full cross-form functionality,

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.000
we can now make additional changes to prepare Rocket ID for all platforms

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
should we receive the permission to do so.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
This is not a delay because of Sony.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
They are making that pretty clear.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
I guess this is just, you know, since they have to kind of set up this whole Rocket ID

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
and the whole other thing that they're going to do.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000
But that is kind of neat that you'll be able to play cross-platform.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:55.000
And I assume if I have it on Steam and I have it on PlayStation 4

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000
and I have it on Switch, which I do have it on all those platforms,

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000
I'll have one ID to have all my data across all those platforms,

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000
which is pretty cool.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Yes.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000
That's very cool.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000
All right.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Let's check out what is in stores this week,

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
what types of releases we have for games this week.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
We're starting to get into a busy time of year, right, Logie?

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Yeah, well, yeah, we've already been there.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
We're still there.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Bass Pro Shops to Strike Championship Edition coming out on the Switch.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Nickelodeon Kart Racers on the Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Paw Patrol on a Roll for PC, the Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000

Chicken Range on the Switch.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Disaster Report 4 Plus Summer Memories on PlayStation 4.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Eve Burst Error R on the Switch.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Castlevania Requiem on PlayStation 4.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:14.000
My Hero One's Justice on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4,

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
and Xbox One.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000
And last but not least, Red Dead Redemption 2 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
No PC, boo.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
All right.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Well, traveling to Japan to check out the releases over there this week.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000
You know, the only big one that I'm seeing here on the 26th

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000
is we have the Red Dead Redemption 2 also coming out in Japan.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
I don't think I see any other Japanese releases.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Oh, no, there they are. They're there on the 25th.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
That's why they're on different day.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
I don't know many of these games, but...

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Oh, no, this one. This is the big one on PlayStation 4.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection International.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Remember how they bumped it back a little bit for Japan?

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Yeah, to fix some things and make it appropriate?

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
That is finally out on the PlayStation 4 this week in Japan.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
So that's out on the 25th.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
That's why it took me a minute to find because it's the day before Red Dead.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Some other releases in Japan.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
LEGO DC Super-Villains gets its Japanese release.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.000
A game called Sakura Sakura, no relation to Dark Sakura, is also out.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000
And then Noratu Ojuu To Norinako Heart in Premium and Limited Edition.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
That is also out in Japan this week.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
That is all on the PlayStation 4.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Checking out the Nintendo Switch this week.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
That same Street Fighter collection also on the Switch,

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
as well as Beyblade Burst Battle Zero,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
and LEGO DC Super-Villains also on the Switch this week,

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000
as well as the Noratu Ojuu To Norinako Heart,

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
which I had previously mentioned.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000
And I believe that is it for Japan.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Checking out to see the Vita, actually.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
That Sakura Sakura is also out on the Vita this week

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
in a regular and limited edition,

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
even though we know the Vita is on its way out.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Hey, in Japan, there's still a party going on.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000
So, Loki, would you mind covering the UK while Jamie is still out?

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Yep. Some different stuff coming out in the UK.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.000
So we've got Spin Tires Mud Runner, American Wilds Edition.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000
That's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Red Dead Redemption 2 also coming out as well on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Dragon Ball Xenoverse and Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Looks like a combo pack there for PlayStation 4.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000
And Dragon Ball FighterZ and Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000
They're also doing another combo pack as well on PlayStation 4.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:26.000
PAW Patrol on a roll on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and 3DS.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000
And last but not least, a game that my son's really interested in.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Bendy and the Ink Machine.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
That's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One over there.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Which one's that? I don't know much about that.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000
It's like a survivor horror game,

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:47.000
but it's, imagine like old school Mickey Mouse,

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
but it's not Mickey Mouse.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Kind of like, it reminds me a little bit like Epic Mickey,

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000
where they had, I mean, I guess that's technically still Mickey characters.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
They're knockoff Mickey characters.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
It's not Mickey Mouse and not Goofy,

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000
but it's like horrible shit that happens and it's a scary game.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
And of course, actually a few more games here.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000
We've got Rapala Fishing Pro Series on the Switch,

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Chicken Range on PlayStation 4 and the Switch,

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Just Dance 2019, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch,

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Nickelodeon Kart Racers on PlayStation 4,

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Xbox One and the Switch,

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
and what has Ninja Turtles in there?

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Rugrats and SpongeBob and...

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
The only way I'd get that game is if it has Zim.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I can't really tell from the box art there.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Probably not, unfortunately.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Whatever. Hey Arnold's in there though.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Hey Arnold, hell yeah.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Alright, let's move on and get to...

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
I'm sorry I'm laughing,

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
because it's probably not picking up on the microphones,

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
but, so I full on fed Smoosh during the break.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Guess what? Guess what? He's back now.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Screaming again. I'm back bitches.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
I'm back to scream for more. What's he want?

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Is this supposed to be a limitless supply of food?

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.000
What a fat ass.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Feed me more.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Alright, let's get to the mailbag.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Every week you guys email us,

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
participate at orangeloungeradio.com

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000
and we take your emails and we read them here on the show.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
We didn't get a lot of emails,

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000
just one email in two parts is what we got this week,

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
so we'll read it.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
It's from our old pal Robert M who emails us a lot,

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
and I will always read Robert M emails,

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
especially when none of the rest of you are emailing,

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
so here we go.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Robert M says,

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000
I still don't know when I'll get the chance to be in a party group to play,

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000
but I do see that in spite of my original email saying the service

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
was only showing the Windows and Steam OS Linux versions,

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.000
the Mac version of Jackbox Party Pack 5 is in fact on sale on Steam,

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
and other services as well.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000
I do see the Switch store sales generally line up pretty well with Steam sales.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000
I'm guessing PlayStation and Xbox do as well.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.000
There you go, that's the first part from Robert M.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.000
So first off, I forgot that Jackbox Party Pack 5 came out.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
I need to pick that up.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
I guess that was just this past week.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Only had friends, and I totally play that.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000
But then really kind of getting to the second part of the question

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
about the sales generally lining up,

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.000
usually because the publisher may choose to do a sale.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Let's say in this case,

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Jackbox Games themselves decides to do a sale,

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.000
they will probably do kind of a similar thing across all platforms.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000
In fact, some distribution ends,

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
like I think Amazon was notorious for this.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
I don't know if this is still the rule with Amazon,

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
but Amazon's thing was always like,

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
if your product goes on sale anywhere else,

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000
you will have to lower the price here too.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Like you cannot have a sale somewhere else

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
that isn't matched on Amazon basically,

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.000
and that's part of the way that they fight for the low prices.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Not that Amazon is usually known for game sales,

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
but I guess they do sell, I mean,

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
I should say, let me choose my words carefully,

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
digital game sales.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
I know they do offer it,

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
but I always thought I liked the physical stuff.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
But I haven't bought a game on Amazon ever since

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:10.000
I got rid of the discount for the Amazon Prime.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Last game I bought was Final Fantasy XI.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Again, it was like another copy because I wanted another.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Bobby in chat says there was a Humble Bundle with the first three packs

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
and even some of the earlier You Don't Know Jax.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Yeah, I remember that one.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
So like a charity thing, of course,

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.000
since it was through the Humble Bundle.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
There's a second part to the email from Robert M.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
who says, sorry for the addendum,

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.000
but Cuphead was just released for Mac yesterday.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
It runs wonderfully on my old MacBook.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
That is all from Robert M.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Oh, yes, Cuphead, still a game worth looking at.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Great bullet hell game with a really nice twist on it

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
with the whole, like, 30s cartoon stuff.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000
It's a fantastic game worth your time

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.000
if you haven't checked it out.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
My seal of approval. There you go.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Again, participate at OrangeLawnTrady.com

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000
is the place to send an email

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
if you want to send us an email for a future week.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000
So there you go.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Loki, what do you have for us?

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
All right.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Well, let's talk a little bit about a game that I alluded to earlier

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
when we were talking about mech games,

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.000
and that would be Sega's Virtual On.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:15.000
So recently we just had a Virtual On.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.000
What was it?

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.000
It was a certain magical Virtual On,

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
which was, I think, like a spinoff.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:27.000
But now the actual Cybertroopers Virtual On

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:31.000
and also I believe the, was it Cybertroopers Virtual On

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:35.000
or a Torrio Tangrim

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000
and then Virtual On Force.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Those are going to be released as well.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:45.000
This is coming out now with this also crowdfunded arcade stick

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
that they had for Virtual On.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000
So you can get that with the Tenita twin stick controller,

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.000
which looks goddamn massive.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
But the twin sticks were awesome.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000
That's what made the game fun.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.000
No idea how much that is, but looks pretty massive.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.000
The game itself, though, is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:12.000
So we'll have to wait and see what the availability of those are as well.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
I mean, God.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Neat.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Are you excited it's coming back?

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
I am. I think it's cool.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.000
I wouldn't necessarily spend money on giant controllers

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.000
just for, you know, a couple games,

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000
but it's neat that they're doing that.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
That sounds like something that maybe Jamie and Dan might be into,

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
but I don't know.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000
I will have to ask her next time.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Actually, Jamie's going to be live in the studio next week,

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.000
so I'll have to ask her when she's here.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Yeah, so I was just trying to see real quick

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
what the actual sticks cost.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
It went through like a crowdfunding thing.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Oh, here we go.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Ho, ho, ho.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
No.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
That's a big no.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000
So apparently...

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Okay, okay, that's what their funding goal was.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
I was like, is that the cost of the sticks?

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Because I ain't buying it for that.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Let's see, so what was the actual cost here?

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000
I've got to translate this because it's all in Japanese.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000
I don't think it says.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.000
I think they were just raising money.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Okay, here we go.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:22.000
So 55,400 yen would get you a twin stick controller.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Wow.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.000
I don't know what that translates to.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
I think if you want to be really quick and dirty,

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
100 yen is a dollar.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
So $600?

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Yeah.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
No.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
But that's a very quick answer.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Honestly, it's probably a little more generous than that.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000
But anyway.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.000
No thanks.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Not worth it for me.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
But, you know, it's cool that they're making it.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
All right.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Let's move on and talk about something

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
they're not going to be making anymore, unfortunately.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
These game magazines out of the UK.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
So you wouldn't know them here in the States

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000
unless you imported them.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
But maybe some of our folks overseas

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
know Games Master and Games TM.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
They have announced they are closing.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
The publisher of the magazine, Future,

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
has said that both publications will be releasing

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
their final issues in November.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Games TM has been around since 2002.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Games Master goes all the way back to 1993

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
when it was released along a TV show

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.000
that had the exact same name that was on Channel 4.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Even when the Channel 4 show got cancelled in 1998,

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000
the Games Master magazine was still running.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
So Future, in a statement, said that these magazines

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
were no longer profitable parts of the business.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
The decision was difficult,

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.000
but they're proud of the work, et cetera, et cetera.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Anyhow, there's other titles like Edge, PC Gamer,

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
and the official PlayStation and Xbox magazines.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Those are not expected to be affected,

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
but it's just, you know, magazines again.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000
The internet is kind of hurting all that.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
It's instant, and magazines aren't.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Magazines are always kind of more collector's items

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.000
in the state of nature.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
I don't even find, like, I get only one magazine now,

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
and that's Game Informer because I keep signing up

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000
for their stupid discount thing over at GameStop occasionally.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
And it's not because I actually sign up for it,

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
it's just because stuff I purchase,

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000
and I always use my, you know, card with it.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.000
It cruises points, and then the points pay for the membership,

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.000
so I don't really pay for it necessarily.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.000
But, like, I honestly, I look at the magazine,

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000
flip through it, like, very briefly, and I toss it aside.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000
I'm like, eh.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Although this month they had a thing about Dreams,

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:27.000
which is that new medium medical game, so that looks cool.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:31.000
The more that I see of that, the more kind of hype I kind of get behind it,

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000
but we haven't really heard too much about it.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Other than, like, they kind of had it, like, bits behind, you know,

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.000
like the transition stuff between things they were showing at, like,

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
I don't remember if it was the PlayStation event

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.000
or if it was the Sony press conference,

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
but they had, like, it as, like, a transition thing,

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
and they didn't really say much about it.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
I think it was the last PSX because the E3 thing this year

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000
was they went between the rooms and that whole thing, remember?

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
They started in the barn, yeah.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Yes, I remember and hate that.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Yeah, but it's probably something they won't be bringing back next year.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
All right, let's move on. Loki.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.000
All right, so this is unfortunate as well because, you know,

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:14.000
as much as I like games, I hate when things are removed from games,

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.000
and as we may have talked about when the PC version was coming out,

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Senran Kongura Burst Renewal, which was delayed,

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:29.000
they were removing the intimacy mode from the port that was coming,

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I think, the PC.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Well, now they're saying they're going to be removing it

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.000
from the PlayStation 4 version as well.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Basically, they're saying that the wishes of the platform holder

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
want it removed.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Intimacy mode, I'm assuming, was like a photo mode or something like that.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000
So, of course, you know, intimacy mode, you can dress up your characters

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:57.000
and grope them, so they wanted to remove that.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Apparently, they weren't happy with that being in the game.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Yeah, I feel like there's, you know, people out there

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
that would probably take a lot of issue to that,

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
especially with everything that's going on in the world.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.000
It might not be the best time for a mode like that, I suppose.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
There's people defending it, though,

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000
saying, like, if you don't stand up for stuff you don't like,

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000
when they come for the stuff you do like, you've already lost.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Sit down.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
There's more important things to worry about in the world

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
than your anime titties.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
All right.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
In fact, you know, it's really worrisome.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.000
You know, it really gets the internet up in an uproar.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Puddles.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.000
You remember with Superman, the new Superman game on PlayStation 4?

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Spider-Man.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
That's what I meant.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Spider-Man game on PlayStation 4, people were taking issue that,

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:51.000
oh my God, there's less puddles in the game than they were showing at E3.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Well, you know, there was a little bit of a tongue-in-cheek thing

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
that happened that Insomniac did

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
when they did an update to the game this week.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Now, they did a patch that did some, you know, useful game features

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000
that people were looking for, like a new game plus mode,

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000
and they also will have new items in the photo mode,

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000
like stickers, frames, you know, the type of shit

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000
that people do on their Instagrams and those type of, you know,

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
photo editing apps, Twitter even as well.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Well, one of the other stickers that they put in the game

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:25.000
is a cartoon puddle, and they actually did a tweet.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.000
So there was a tweet that was put out by one of the guys there

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
that said, we have a new patch today.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Not only do we have a new game plus,

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.000
we have a bunch of stuff in photo mode, including stickers and frames,

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
and what's funny is they go back to that scene with the puddle,

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
and they put a bunch of new puddles with the stickers,

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
and he signed it with, I fixed this for you.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Happy face.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
I love that.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
What a sassy little bitch.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
What a sassy bitch, I love it.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
I love it.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Yes, hey dog, I heard you like puddles.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Our assistant, J100 Matt in chat says, puddles with puddles.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Puddle-ception.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Just a few more stories for you guys,

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
then we're going to get to your calls at Orange Lounge Radio,

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
all one word on Skype, but first, Loki.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000
So we talked a little bit about, I think it was a few weeks ago,

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.000
about Mario Kart and how they were receiving a cease and desist,

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:17.000
because they were operating a tour service that was in go-karts,

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000
and they were dressed up like Mario Kart characters,

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
and Nintendo took issue with that,

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.000
because apparently they were colliding with cars and stuff like that,

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:30.000
and they didn't like the image that that was leaving.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Well, Mario Kart decided, hey, guess what, we don't give a fuck,

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:38.000
and they were going to continue doing business as usual,

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.000
despite having the cough of $90,000 in damages.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Apparently they're saying that right now they're going to be continuing their service

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:52.000
as it's appealing the ruling with the courts.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:55.000
So, I don't know.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.000
I don't know if you'd want to pick a fight with Nintendo,

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.000
but $90,000 seems like a pretty lax amount of money,

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000
but now...

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.000
The man can't shut me down.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Yeah, so I don't know.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.000
They know that they're holding a blue shell in their inventory right now.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000
I'd totally do it, though.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000
I would totally do a tour dressed up like Yoshi or Mario.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Oh, yeah, heck yeah. This sounds like a lot of fun.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Why not?

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
I think I mentioned this when the story first came up.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.000
I went to that little racing place that isn't far from here one time.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.000
An ex took me there a long time ago. It was my ex.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.000
And we did that whole thing, and I was like, this is like playing Mario Kart,

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
but for real and without the red shells and green shells.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.000
It was a lot of fun.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
I kind of want to do that again sometime.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
They need a totally like an AR.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:43.000
I know they have the virtual, the VR Mario Kart,

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:46.000
but they need like an AR Mario Kart game of like...

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Where you play with your real kart.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
No, where you're actually in real go-karts and stuff,

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000
and you hit a button or whatever that's on the steering wheel,

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
and then maybe they could have projectors or something that project.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Are you talking about like Mario Kart Arcade?

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.000
I'm talking about like an actual go-kart place or something.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.000
You know, do like battle mode.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Oh, like, okay, okay.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Like maybe like you have a HUD that is on the windshield

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
or something that shows you like items and stuff.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Yeah.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000
That'd be silly.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
I don't think they'd do it because it'd be too dangerous and hard to do,

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
but like, it'd be neat.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Yeah, it could be fun.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000
All right.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.000
One more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line tonight,

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
and unfortunately, this is not so lighthearted.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
It's pretty sad, but the co-founder of Microsoft, Paul Allen,

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
passed away this week at 65.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Now, I don't think Paul Allen really did a lot directly with the Xbox,

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:38.000
but certainly as he was one of the co-founders of Microsoft,

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.000
without him, we would not have the Xbox or any Xbox One, et cetera,

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.000
and PC gaming and all of that.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Microsoft has a huge responsibility and all that.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
He did pass away at the age of 65.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
That's really not old when you think about it.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.000
He passed away from non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
He had been fighting various...

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:00.000
I mean, he had fought Hodgkin's lymphoma a while ago,

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:03.000
so unfortunately, yeah, he did pass in this past week.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.000
There was a tweet from the current CEO of Microsoft

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
that said Paul Allen's contributions to our company and the community

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000
are indispensable.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
He was the co-founder of Microsoft,

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.000
and so his own quiet and persistent ways created magical products,

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:20.000
experiences, and institutions.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:24.000
He founded Microsoft along with Bill Gates in 1975.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000
He did leave the company in 1982 when he was first diagnosed,

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.000
but then I think he was on the board or something for a little while,

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000
and he didn't really officially resign from the board

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
until a few years ago.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
He wasn't only known for Microsoft, though, however.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.000
He did some other things.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
He owned sports teams. I know that.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
He was a big presence in the Pacific Northwest

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
because he owned the Portland Trail Blazers.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
He owned the Seahawks.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:51.000
He founded Vulcan, which is a lot of the philanthropy type of things

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000
are through that,

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:56.000
and Ticketmaster was also something I think that he was an investor in.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.000
I don't know how much he did with that, but he did that as well.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:04.000
He was invested in various apps, one called SportsStream,

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
which is like a social app for sports people,

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:11.000
and he had a controlling interest in charter communications at one point too.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
So, you know, he took all that Microsoft money

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
and basically invested in all these other companies.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
So he's had a huge impact on the tech world

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
and unfortunately no longer with us,

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000
so a lot of people are remembering him this week.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Going to our chat at live.vognetwork.com,

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Bobby Blackwell says he co-founded TechTV,

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:30.000
which was eaten by G4 after he gave up on it.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:33.000
He said the reason why Comcast bought TechTV,

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.000
and this is Bobby's comments in our chat,

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.000
is because Paul Allen was bored with it and wanted to get rid of it.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
I did not realize that.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Wow, that's also very huge.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:43.000
I'm glad he got bored with it.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Yeah, right?

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Somebody should have found a way to entertain him.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.000
What did he want to see on the...

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Did he want, like, dancing kittens on the network?

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Because if so, they should have just had that show at night.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000
We'll get you all the kittens.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Keep Paul Allen happy.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
That merger would have never happened.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Anyway, that's unfortunate.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Well, you know, think of it this way.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
TechTV and G4 and all that suck.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
It didn't suck when Paul Allen was involved.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:08.000
And when he left, well, you know the rest.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Anyway.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Let's move on.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
We're going to open up our Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
all one word, if you want to give us a call during our show.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000
We're running really short tonight.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000
It's not even 8 o'clock yet.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
But I feel like the news,

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.000
like a lot of the news isn't really like,

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.000
it's a lot of quick hits.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:32.000
You don't have a lot of really deep dive news stories this week.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
But maybe you have something you want to talk about

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
or bring up that we didn't get to.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Sure. Well, since we mentioned,

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
we were talking about backwards compatibility

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.000
with the Orange Box and stuff.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Guess what your Xbox One can run now?

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Crysis.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Crysis.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
It can run Crysis 1, 2, and 3.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Where's Breslull? He needs to know.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
They're all backwards compatible.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.000
So go play your Crysis games.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Hooray!

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
And then, of course,

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:01.000
there's a game I don't like to talk about because it's garbage.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.000
But hey, this garbage game called Metal Gear Solid,

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
or Metal Gear Survive,

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:09.000
they're doing an event where you can get a Pyramid Head costume

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
and they have Castlevania music

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:15.000
because it's just a total fucking shit show.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Because Konami realizes that the retro stuff sells.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
They don't really know how to sell it yet,

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
so they just kind of throw it everywhere and see what sticks.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Just don't.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Just no one.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000
No.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Don't buy the game.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Terrible.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Terrible game.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:32.000
And then, man, this is a flashback for me.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Independent game shops are told they're not going to get

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Red Dead Redemption 2 until November.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Yep, that's unfortunate.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.000
And that's pretty typical because

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:45.000
when demand goes up, there's only a finite amount of copies,

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
and guess who gets those copies?

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000
The large retailers.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Amazon.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Amazon.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Which is why your old company, sadly, is no longer around, really.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
In part.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Yeah, lots of reasons, but yes.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:00.000
That's definitely...

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.000
It didn't help being in those situations.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:06.000
I had to be in the end of telling people a lot of times,

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Hey, you know all the Call of Duty's you order for launch day?

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Yeah, you're gonna get them launch day.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000
A lot of times.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
And I'm sure they loved to hear that.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
They got used to it.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Unfortunately.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000
That's horrible.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.000
It is.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:20.000
A hitstun in chat says,

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Oh, I didn't know Loki OLR's old company isn't around anymore.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Well, the company might still be there, right?

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000
No, it's gone.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.000
The whole company went under, so they sold to their competitors,

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
and then...

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:32.000
I don't know if they...

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
I'm assuming they kept part of the game's version.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
They kept a couple of people on from the game's thing,

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000
but they have their own games company as well,

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
so it was kind of overlap.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
But then they kept some of the...

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:48.000
like 30 of the people from my company, the video side,

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.000
over, and they opened like a satellite branch or whatever,

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:54.000
but yeah, they closed down in 2014, so...

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Now I've moved on to bigger and better things.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
So, it's all good.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Just don't have to deal with the game drama anymore.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Trust me, it's a lot less stressful now.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Yeah, what you do now is a lot less stressful.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Yeah, a hell lot less stressful.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
You're a career man now.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Yeah, it's using my potential even better.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Do you get asked to do crunch time at your current job?

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.000
No.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000
No?

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.000
No.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.000
No, I just get people angry because...

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Well, don't say too much about your career.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.000
I manage data, and so I point out when they're not managing their own data, and so...

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:29.000
People don't like to hear that.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
And they don't like hearing that, like,

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000
And they're like,

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Okay, and then I check back six months later,

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
why haven't you cleaned this crap up yet?

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.000
And they're like,

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Why are you always coming down on us and throwing us under the bus?

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:46.000
I'm like, because you're not fucking doing your work after six months.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Yeah.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000
No, I go through a similar struggle in what I do.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
I mean, I love my job, don't get me wrong,

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
and I've never talked negative about my job on the show,

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
but, you know, part of my job is I do training,

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
and I train in medical-related things,

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
so you know HIPAA is a big thing, you know,

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
privacy of patient information.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.000
So basically, part of my job is just making sure that every year,

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
everybody's doing their training, because that's, you know, the law.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000
But some people don't like the fact that I know

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.000
when they're not taking their HIPAA training on a yearly basis,

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
because I come to track them down saying,

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:18.000
You know, you do have to take your 30 minutes and do this training,

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
you know, 30 minutes a year to do this training,

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.000
because, you know, we're kind of like legally have to do that.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.000
And some of these people, you know, they're very, very high up,

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
and they don't really want to be told that,

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
because it's like, I don't write the laws, buddy.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Yeah.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
So, yeah. Anyhow.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Let's see. Bonds006 in chat says,

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Clean your damn room.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
It's kind of similar to that.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.000
It is. I mean, it's stupid stuff that I have to manage.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000
You know, it's stuff I don't technically have to manage.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000
I've just taken it upon myself to manage, because it annoys me,

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.000
because I used to be in the position where I had to clean.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Well, I still have to clean it up now,

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
but I used to be in a position where, you know,

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:01.000
it's done, and it's just a cascading effect.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Yeah. One more call for calls.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype,

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:09.000
if you want to give us a call and talk about whatever's on your mind tonight.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:12.000
This is one of those nights. It's going to be a quiet night here at Studio LR.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
You know, if I don't end up using my second camera,

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.000
we have a nice HD camera, HD and 4K camera,

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
that we could totally use in this room.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Yoink. Let's steal that. Set that up.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:26.000
I don't know if that XP computer can handle that,

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:30.000
but we can definitely put it on a new computer.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
If you don't feel like calling, we'll field,

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
because I know it is a little short,

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:39.000
I will field questions in chat at live.orangelandradio.com.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Jesus Christ. Maybe if I wasn't broken, we wouldn't have such a short show.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:47.000
live.vognetwork.com if you want to post any questions.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:51.000
We'll just, you know, we can take open questions in our chat room,

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
since we are running a little short.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
But yeah, no, that would be great. Actually, that's a huge,

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:59.000
that's one thing off the list. It's more the computer is the big thing I have to buy.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
And then we're gonna have to think about how to rearrange this room,

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:05.000
because ideally, all of us will be against this wall here,

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.000
so this wall can kind of be green, and we can do tricks with it.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000
And so that way, because obviously we can't be at the same,

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.000
because right now, the way we're facing, if we were to put a camera face,

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
like you would see my dirty kitchen behind everything.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000
It's just like shit everywhere in the kitchen. I don't want to shoot at that angle.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000
You could face it this way.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.000
You could. You could do it this way against this larger wall here.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000
That's something we could do.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Because then you have all the posters up already.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
It's just the lighting in this room is not exactly what you're supposed to do.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Yeah, this isn't exactly the best studio, but we can figure that out.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Keep in mind, the green screen that I did buy came with more lights.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
I just don't use them because they can get hot.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Yeah.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.000
So, but...

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.000
I almost got a green screen, but then I was like,

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
no, I've already spent enough money on this crap.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
I still may, because that was the other thing too,

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
is like if I don't end up using the camera for this,

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:52.000
I still may keep it for when I actually do non-DDR content as well,

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
which we can always buy another one.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Doesn't the chat, I mean, chat, do you want us to have a green screen behind it?

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.000
I mean, shouldn't we be able to float away to different worlds

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
and different places on a whim?

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Or have the games that we're talking about possibly behind them?

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Well, we could do like a total, because now that I've messed with OBS now,

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
and I'm like a little bit more comfortable,

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
we can do like a lot of fancy shit with that, so.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Yeah.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Well, I mean, we're all the...

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
I don't know how much I can say on,

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:21.000
but there's already one fancy kind of thing that Bobby is working on.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
So that's all I can say.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Yeah.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000
So it'd be kind of nice.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.000
I think it's fancy.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Anyway, S2100matt in chat says, nah, start with a regular studio show.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Well, I mean, don't worry, Matt.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.000
I'm not going to go crazy out the gate, and it is still a radio show,

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:39.000
but it would be nice to have like the green screen,

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
and we could just put like a static image,

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
but when we're talking about a particular game,

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.000
like the classic game of the week,

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
have some of the footage of the game of the week running behind it

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.000
on the green screen.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000
It'd be kind of nice, wouldn't it?

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.000
So, all right.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Anyhow, which Tigerclaw is exactly saying in chat.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Yes, that is ideal.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Anyway, we do have a call finally coming in.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Y'all are slow tonight.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Hi, you're on Orson's Radio.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Who's this?

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Hey, Bizack Def.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Oops, she didn't hear what I just said.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Did you?

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Hi, Bizack Def.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.000
How are you, buddy?

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Well, basically, I want to talk about Pokemon Go.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Sure.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Why not?

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Why not?

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Let's be a Pokemon Go show.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
What do you want to talk about?

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Well, since we don't have a Pokestop podcast.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Anyways, but I want to talk about something you were talking

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:31.000
on your gaming week sense of older people playing Pokemon Go,

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:35.000
and it's something that, in my case,

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:40.000
I also said it's all people playing Pokemon Go

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:48.000
or people with under 50s, maybe in their 60s too,

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.000
but at least in my city, I have known many people

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:57.000
that actually are families, and they play together,

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.000
and it's really, really amazing.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:09.000
And even though the age difference is kind of big,

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:15.000
we can still talk together, and we have a really great time,

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:20.000
even though, like Bobby said, it's a dead game, unquote.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:25.000
It's still really fun to hang out with people of every age.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Bobby still opens my gifts pretty regularly,

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:33.000
so he doesn't really think it's a dead game, just so we're clear.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Yeah, I know.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.000
I'm just teasing.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Even like yesterday, we got the Ultra Friend level.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:44.000
I was about to say, actually, funny we bring that up,

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
so let me out, Bobby, on something else here too,

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:50.000
is that I hit level 40 in Pokemon Go this week.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.000
I can't believe I left that out of my gaming week,

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000
but I hit the maximum.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
I totally neglected to say this.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Congrats again.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.000
I hit the maximum level in Pokemon Go,

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.000
which means not only am I the maximum level in Pokemon Go

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
and the maximum level in Ingress.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.000
So in both of my antics, I'm a 60-40, or 16-40,

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
which means I'm the max level in Ingress.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
That must mean you're a shoo-in for whatever beta

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
they're going to have for the Harry Potter game.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.000
I can't fucking wait.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
I hope that Harry Potter game kicks ass.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Look at my credentials.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Look at my credentials.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Exactly, right?

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
But yeah, I hit level 40,

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
and the reason why I'm invoking Bobby when I do it,

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:25.000
even though he didn't message me to tell me he triggered it

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
so I could pop an experience egg, it's okay.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.000
I was so close that when Bobby and I hit three star friends,

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:34.000
that is what pushed me to level 40,

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
was Bobby and I's friendship.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.000
So Bobby, even though you say Pokemon Go is a dead game,

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.000
I just want you to remember,

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:44.000
our friendship made me the nerd I am today.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:51.000
I did pop an egg, though, when we had four star friends.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Yeah, and I think the latest patch to the game

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
made it harder to get the jump on that

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.000
when you first opened the app,

01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:59.000
because I open up the app, I'm like,

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.000
okay, I need to go pop an egg,

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
and before I could even hit items, it's like,

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:03.000
you and Loki O-L-R are friends.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.000
I'm like, god damn it, I didn't get a chance to pop the egg.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.000
I think they might have made that harder

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:11.000
because so many people were really milking XP from that.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:12.000
That's easy.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Don't make your stupid eggs count towards that, then.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Yeah, that would be one way to do it.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Or, at the same time, is it really that bad

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.000
because people are buying those experience eggs?

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
I just need all the fucking notifications

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.000
that pop immediately.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.000
I'm trying to sync my Pokemon.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Did you upgrade the latest version

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:34.000
where they consolidated all the notifications?

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.000
They don't, though.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
It's still good at every...

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Yeah, but at least they moved the icon for the Go Plus down

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.000
so it doesn't get in the way now.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
No, it's still in the way.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Oh, because you don't have an iPhone X.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
You have the smaller screen iPhone, right?

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
The screen's not that small.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:51.000
It's just like, I don't know.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.000
It's stupid.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:55.000
I just don't want the notifications.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Interesting.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000
That is weird.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Anyway, sorry.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.000
I didn't mean to make it about me, Act F,

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
but I felt that was an important point,

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000
is that I hit level 40.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
I'm the biggest nerd.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Well, technically, I hit level 40 before you, bud.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:10.000
I'm still level 7 on Ingress, though.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Oh, well, at least I have that.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:13.000
I have that.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:17.000
I think I'm only the second player in Sacramento

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:20.000
that I know of, but the problem is

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
our team and the Resistance team in Ingress

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
don't exactly mingle a lot,

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:28.000
so I don't know if any of them are level 40 in Pokemon Go.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
I suspect one of them might be,

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
but you can't really ping a player in Pokemon Go

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
like you can in Ingress to check their profile,

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:37.000
so if I'm not second, I'm probably third,

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
but that's in this whole city.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
It's pretty disgusting.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:46.000
That's still a really great achievement,

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:49.000
getting max levels on both games.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Thank you.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Again, congrats on that,

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
especially on Ingress. It's not easy.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.000
It's not.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
It is not. It is really not.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:01.000
It's taken, but you know, I've met so many rats.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Just on Saturday, just yesterday,

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:08.000
we had a get-together of about 27 players here locally.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Just got together and had lunch and having a good old time.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
We were kind of playing the game together, actually,

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.000
and a couple times this week.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
I don't usually talk about this type of stuff during my gaming week

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.000
just because I feel like people probably get bored with Ingress chat,

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:23.000
but it's a short show, so here you go.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
We got together twice.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
We did it Thursday night, and then we did it Friday night as well

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:30.000
because we thought it would be funny

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
because the other team had to spend a couple hours

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
to take down what we did Thursday night,

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
so we were like, let's do it again, and we did it bigger.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:41.000
So we were just having fun.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:44.000
So what we do, we all get in two separate cars,

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:48.000
and we drive down what we call the grid, so downtown,

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.000
and we build these portals to max level and max strength.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000
But the whole time we're riding in the car,

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.000
we're just cracking jokes and talking and just having a good time,

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
and it's like all these people from different walks of life

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:02.000
who play this game, like these people I would have never met,

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
but they just happen to play the same game, you know what I mean?

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Yeah, especially.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:11.000
And turning back to the main topic I was going to talk about,

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:16.000
it's really awesome that you can pretty much hang out

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
with any kind of people.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:23.000
I have played with people way younger than me,

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:26.000
again, people older.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:30.000
It's something I really, really like about this game

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:34.000
and the community itself, especially in Pokémon GO,

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:39.000
because in Ingress we all know that doesn't happen really frequently,

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:42.000
but in Pokémon GO, even if you're like,

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:46.000
I'm Team Valor or I'm Team Mystic, I'm Team Instinct,

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:50.000
you can still help each other in so many ways.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Sadly, Ingress is very much not like that.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:56.000
The whole game thing and that stuff, it's like another thing,

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:59.000
but it's not like the main thing, and I like that.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:00.000
I like that.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Yeah.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:04.000
How do you feel about the whole Pokéstops in Mexico?

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Now, you're right outside, because they tend to draw the borders

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:10.000
at a certain latitude and longitude for that kind of stuff,

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:13.000
and you live just north of where they drew that border, right?

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Yeah.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:20.000
They launched the beta in Mexico on Tuesday, if I remember correctly,

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:24.000
and I'm level 40, so I'm awesome.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.000
I'm going to play Pokéstops and all that stuff.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:34.000
And when I open the app, the Pokéstop nomination doesn't appear,

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:38.000
so I started investigating, and also it has to do with Ingress

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:42.000
and how the cells work, how they tie up their place.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Oh, yeah.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:49.000
So yeah, I can't nominate Pokéstops.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:57.000
I have even nominated four, but I nominated four way south of the city,

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:00.000
the outskirts, literally, of the city.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Okay.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:08.000
So yeah, I had to go way, probably not an hour,

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:13.000
but close to an hour from my home to at least try it.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:20.000
And curiously, and this one, I'm really frustrated about it.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:26.000
From where I work, it's like a kilometer away

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
where I can start nominating Pokéstops.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
So it's like, really?

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:33.000
One kilometer away?

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Yeah, so close yet so far.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:36.000
But you know what's funny?

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:39.000
And so I get the other end of that because I am the high enough level in Ingress.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
I do review stuff in OPR.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
I haven't seen stuff that's come in from Pokémon yet,

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
and supposedly you can tell the difference

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:49.000
because Pokémon makes you take an extra picture, which is great.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.000
That's actually a really good thing, and more stuff will go through because of that.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:56.000
And just a tip, if you are going to submit stuff in Pokémon GO,

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.000
make sure you're not just submitting two of the exact same picture.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Do one close-up, especially if it's a plaque.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Do one picture of the plaque, and then do one way back

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:09.000
where you can see the plaque, but you can see what it's on

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
and that it's not in a private building somewhere,

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:14.000
that it's outside somewhere accessible on a sidewalk.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Because if I see that, it's publicly accessible somewhere like that,

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
I'm way more likely to approve it.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:22.000
That's the rules. It has to be publicly accessible.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
It can't be in a median.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
And especially in a place like Mexico,

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:30.000
the Google Street technology is not the same as it is in the States,

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:33.000
so we don't necessarily have street view for everything.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Even here in California, I get reviews for some stuff in Mexico.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:41.000
And the other day I got a church,

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:45.000
and all I had to go off of was the satellite view

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
and a really super close-up picture.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:51.000
And I still approved it in good faith, pun intended.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.000
I still approved it because there was like no pokey stops around.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
I was like, you know what?

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:59.000
And the picture was definitely like a church-related thing,

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
and I'm like, I'm just going to trust this is legit

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:04.000
because on the satellite view, there was nothing for me to distinguish

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
that that was indeed a church and not somebody's house.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:09.000
And that's the thing you're always paranoid of in Ingress.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
You do not want somebody's house to get a portal,

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
and people will try it.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Oh, yeah. I know people that kind of have tried this on Ingress.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.000
But yeah, talking about the process in Pokemon Go,

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:29.000
there's more steps because it's not only take the picture,

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:32.000
name the title, description, and that's it.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.000
No, you do have to take another picture,

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:42.000
though I didn't know that you can take a wider shot of the same place.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.000
What I have done is just like in one of the pokey stops,

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
I tried to nominate.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:54.000
It's a mural of Virgencita, the Virgenava de Lupe.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:59.000
And so I took the picture of the mural itself,

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:02.000
and then I turned around and turned to the street.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:05.000
So I took the place that surrounds,

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:09.000
because it tells you the place that surrounds the pokey stops.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
So I took it in that sense.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Oh, right.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:16.000
If that gets rejected, do it again,

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
and do your one of the mural,

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.000
and then cross the street and take a picture

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:25.000
where you see the mural and the entire house that it's on.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
That's what they're looking for.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
That is not necessarily a house.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:32.000
It's like a taco stand.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Okay, that's fine. If it's a taco stand, it doesn't matter.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Because what they want to know,

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
they just want to make sure it's not temporary.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:39.000
It's not a taco truck.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
It's a permanent taco stand of some sort.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.000
You know what I mean?

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:46.000
It's permanent, so it's the wall.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:49.000
And even though I took the picture of the street itself,

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:52.000
so it's not necessarily that bad.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:55.000
But if it gets rejected, I'm going to try again

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
and do that, especially,

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:00.000
because I did get a pokey stop rejected,

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:04.000
but I think it was because of the placement it has,

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:10.000
because it's next to a firefighter place,

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:13.000
and also next to a police station.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.000
So, yeah.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
You know what I think I'll do one night?

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
I don't think there's any NDA or anything.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
I really don't, because OPR is out there.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.000
I think one night I'm going to do this,

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
if you guys would be interested in this.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.000
I don't think everybody would be interested in this.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
But at one point, I think what I'm going to do,

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:31.000
I'm going to do a stream on Twitch

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
of reviewing portals in OPR

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
so you guys can see what I'm doing

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
and what you see in that whole process.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Would that be fun? Would that be interesting?

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
I would watch it.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Yeah, cool. No, I think I'll do that at some point.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Not tonight. Bobby's going to do the post-stream tonight,

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:48.000
but I'm going to plan that for this week sometime.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.000
I think that would be just a quick stream

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:52.000
just so you can kind of get a sense of what all goes into that.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
I bet some of the Pokémon GO fans would be really curious

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:59.000
what an Ingress player is looking for in approving that,

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:02.000
because I know not everybody in the Pokémon GO.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
The nice thing about being 1640 now

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:08.000
is I really feel like I can speak to both games with authority.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
You know what I mean?

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Because I've put my time in in both games, right?

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.000
So I feel like what the Pokémon GO crowd

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
doesn't kind of get about the Ingress crowd,

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.000
because they're like, what?

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:21.000
These people that play another game have the say on it.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
But again, and I've said this a lot on OLR,

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:26.000
the Ingress players are also going to be much more scrutiny

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:29.000
of what is legit and what is not than Pokémon GO,

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
because there's really not a lot of downside

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:35.000
to Pokémon stops and gyms pretty much anywhere.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Although, as SHO 100 Matt points out,

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
you can't stop somewhere in somebody's backyard

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
on a memorial plaque that they put in their backyard,

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
and that's not okay.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
But by having put that time in an Ingress

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
where you understand better the PvP nature of the game,

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:50.000
you understand why the game board can't be full of garbage.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:53.000
It has to be places that are interesting.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
And again, the cool thing about Ingress

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
is that it really has taken me to all these places

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:00.000
I wouldn't have given a shit about otherwise.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:03.000
And to have discovered some of these different murals

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:07.000
or really gorgeous graveyard memorial sites

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:10.000
or the fact that there are more Korean churches

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:13.000
than I can count on my side of town and all this stuff,

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:16.000
I would have never known that before, you know?

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Yeah.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
I still have tons of Poké stuff

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:24.000
that I haven't visited in my own town, so yeah.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Yeah. Very cool stuff.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Well, Act F, I appreciate the conversation on Pokémon.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:30.000
It's one of my favorite subjects,

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:31.000
but I should let you go to see

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
if anyone else wants to sneak in, okay?

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Okay, no problem.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:35.000
All right, have a good one, buddy.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Thanks for having me.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Hey, any time. Thanks for being here. Bye.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.000
All right, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype,

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
if you want to give us a call.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:47.000
We'll leave it open for a little bit longer to see

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:48.000
because I thought I saw somebody in chat

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:49.000
say they wanted to try to get in,

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:50.000
so I'll leave it open a little bit longer

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
to see if anyone else wants to get in.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
But otherwise, we'll probably wrap up here pretty soon.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Don't apologize for taking up time, Act F.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.000
It was a good call.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Let's see, and again, Bobby Blackwell's

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
going to be doing the post-show stream tonight.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
For those of you that are listening live,

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
you can check out his Twitch channel,

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:06.000
at BobbyBlackWolf.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
You can check out mine, at Rob Roberts.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:11.000
You can check out Loki's, at Loki O-L-R.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Yep.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
And then, also, you should add VOG Network

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
while you're at it if you're not already there

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
because even though there's not a lot there yet,

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
you can anticipate that very soon,

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:23.000
you're going to start seeing more and more at VOG Network.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
And we'll let you know more

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
when that's going to come into play.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:30.000
Also, I should do a cheap shout-out for our Discord,

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:34.000
which you can go to at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
You can check that out.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:39.000
And, you know, we pull stories for the show

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
from our Discord that you guys submit.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
If you do like Pokémon GO, we have a little channel

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:46.000
where people kind of just share screenshots, friend codes,

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
things of that sort, and all that.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
By the way, speaking of VOG,

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
I was going to do this for my final thought,

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
but since we have a little extra time,

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
I'll just elaborate a little more on it now.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
This is the final episode of one of our, you know,

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
really starter shows here at VOG Network.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Remember the final episode tomorrow.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.000
So it's, you know, we just want to bid a fond farewell

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
and thanks to the memories to Pod Culture,

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
who's going to be signing off tomorrow

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
with their final episode after, god,

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
I think it's like 12, 13 years.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
I lost count, but they've been going over 10 years.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
You know, on and off, granted.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
They've, you know, had to have some time off

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
due to personal challenges,

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
but, you know, they still were able

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
to crank out the final episode.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:30.000
So he will be signing off with his crew tomorrow

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
here at the Voice Geeks Network.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
It's 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
and we just want to say thank you very much

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
to Brad and the whole crew over at Pod Culture

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:41.000
for being here with the network for so long,

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
and I think there are some more things

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
that he has in store for the future.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
He has said that they are not going to stop

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:50.000
doing the TARDIS interruptus kind of side stuff

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
they do with Doctor Who,

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.000
and I know a lot of people are really into this new series.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.000
I saw a lot of rave reviews for the episode that was today.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Of course, I'm not going to spoil,

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:00.000
because I don't watch it myself,

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.000
so I wouldn't know what to spoil,

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
but I know I was seeing some rave reviews

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:04.000
on Twitters for today's episode,

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
so I know a lot of people are super into Doctor Who right now

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.000
that the Doctor regeneration is kind of, you know,

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:12.000
just always kind of re-energizes the fan base.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.000
So, anyhow, Loki, any other stories you want to get out here

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
before we sign off for the night?

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Nope, I don't have anything.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
All right, and our phone really isn't ringing,

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:22.000
so I think that's it.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
I think we're going to sign off a little early.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
It's a little bit of a shorter show, but what can you do?

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.000
It gives Loki more time to go play Pokemon Go, doesn't it?

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
Uh, yeah, I have to go.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Do you have your Chimchar and your Piplup

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
and your Turtwig and all the Gen 4 stuff?

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
I have, yeah, a lot of those already,

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
so I'm just collecting them as they come.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
What is my Synodex up to right now?

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:42.000
It's up to ten.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
I have ten in the Synodex,

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
but you know what, I'm purposely holding back a little bit,

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:49.000
because I have the candy to evolve a Chimchar and a Piplup,

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:53.000
but I don't have one that is the highest appraisal for the good IVs.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
I'm waiting until I get those.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
I did get a Turtwig with high IVs,

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:01.000
and so I evolved the Groviel, Grotle? Grotle is what they're called.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
I evolved one of those.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:06.000
So I have ten of the new, because you know I got Bidoof.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
I love me some Bidoof.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:11.000
And actually, speaking of Gen 4, there's a little Kricketot,

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
the little red cricket that's in a suit.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
There's one of those in the house right now.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:16.000
I've already evolved one of those.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
I haven't evolved one yet, because again, I can't get one

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:19.000
that's the highest appraisal.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
They're weak as shit. Who cares?

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Just evolve it and delete it.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:26.000
I know, because I'm neurotic about that stuff.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.000
What I'll do, if I get enough candies to evolve two,

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
then I probably will.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:34.000
That's all I do, especially if it's a bird.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:37.000
I'm like, you're just essentially garbage.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
I'm just going to evolve you and throw you away.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Well, my concern is that those Gen 4 starters are everywhere right now,

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.000
but as they start to unleash more and more of Gen 4,

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
this stuff's going to scale back.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:51.000
So I want to try to catch the wonder.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:56.000
I got one of the Bonaire ones I had to get in a raid.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Oh my god, how about that?

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
The Kricketot is on the house? Wonder.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
That's my first one.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.000
So it's HP, stats exceed my calculations.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
So it's level 15 HP. So there you go.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
I'm going to get to 11 right here, live on the show.

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
I'm going to evolve that Kricketot right now.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
How about that? Complaining works!

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Hooray!

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.000
I think the one I got is the same specs, isn't it?

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Yeah, the Wonder HP.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Yeah, nice, right?

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
You know, they should all be the same Pokemon.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:28.000
That looks like a Kricket with a porn mustache or something.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:31.000
That's quite something there, that little evolve one.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.000
It's more like a collar.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
Yeah, Kricketoon.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Oh god, their CP is horrible.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Yeah.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
Oh, because they're bug type.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Anyway, apparently it's the Poke... I know.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Sorry Akuma, the Poke Show.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Hey, you know what?

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:51.000
It's something we play a lot of and there's a lot of excitement right now with the new generation.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:55.000
But we will be talking about plenty more games coming up throughout the next week.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
I know I want to get my hands on Soulcalibur 6.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Loki, Red Dead Redemption 2 is on your radar, I'm sure.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:04.000
Yep, so we'll have some more games to talk about next week.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
For download, so hopefully it'll be downloaded.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:09.000
They said it was supposed to start downloading already, but...

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:12.000
That whole 100 gigs? The 100 gigs you got set aside?

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Hey, I checked my Comcast the other day. I got plenty of gigs left.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.000
It's good.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Especially after Free Leech on certain sites.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
I was surprised that I have that much left.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:28.000
I ate 120 or 122 gigs already this month just from Forza Horizon downloads alone.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
But you know what? Worth it.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:33.000
Yeah, I haven't played Horizon 4 in a while.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Oh, you need to. It's so good. I need to play more.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:39.000
I need to let go of WoW, but this is what happens when I start doing MMOs.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:42.000
Anyhow, let's wrap up.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Thank you for downloading our show and supporting us.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
If you like what you heard, please tell a friend about the show.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if the voices are here to air.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Otherwise, a nice five-star review in a place like iTunes or wherever it is you found this show,

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:02.000
those go a long, long way and we really appreciate it.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:05.000
We're going to wrap up and get final thoughts.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
Loki, we'll go with you.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:13.000
My final thought is I am not going to get rid of the second camera just yet

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:17.000
because I need, apparently, okay, this is stupid.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:22.000
The stupid Fitbit app for PC, you have to sync it via a stupid $6 dongle you get to buy

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:28.000
even though it's fucking Bluetooth and my computer has fucking Bluetooth in it.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:31.000
But no, you have to buy a stupid dongle.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:37.000
So anyways, I'm going to try to be streaming maybe this week at 6.30 Pacific Time,

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Monday through Friday, we'll see.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
So just keep an eye on that.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:44.000
Follow me if you want.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
And I'm going to be doing some DDR stuff

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.000
and hopefully I'm not going to be too out of shape because it's yesterday when I played.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:58.000
Granted, I play nonstop, so it's just straight back-to-back 30 minutes of actual playing DDR and heavy doubles.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:03.000
That was tough. That was really tough.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.000
So tune in though. It'll be fun.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:12.000
Alright. Well, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:17.000
My final thought, I need to figure out what I'm going to dress up as for Halloween

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:20.000
or I'm going to have to recycle the pizza costume that Alan bought,

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
which is why there's a big foam piece of pizza sitting on the couch.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.000
I was wondering about that.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:27.000
That was Alan's Halloween costume he wore to a thing over the weekend.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:32.000
And he dyed his hair orange with that temporary spray stuff and he wore a red shirt, so he was a big slice of pizza.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Yeah, I'm skipping Halloween this year just because.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:37.000
You're no fun.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Well, no, because at my work they tend to do like,

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
we're voting on what we're going to do this year.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
I just don't want to go with their stupid themes.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:49.000
I want to do my own shit and they're like, we're doing circus this year.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:52.000
I'm like, well, I'm doing nothing this year then.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:55.000
I'm not fucking dressing up like circus.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:56.000
You showed them.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:00.000
They did Zoo last year and I dressed up in one of those inflatable T-Rex costumes.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
So I think it's an animal.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
All right. All right. Well, that's it.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:05.000
We're done. We're out of here.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Have a great week, guys. We'll see you in seven days.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Jamie will be back here next week and it's episode number 750.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:17.000
So we hope you'll join us here on another episode of our very, very, very, very, very long running video game podcast.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
In the meantime, happy gaming.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
Be cool to each other. Bye.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:24.000
