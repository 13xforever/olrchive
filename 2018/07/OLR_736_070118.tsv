7000	13000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
13000	27000	Tonight, rumors are growing that Google plans to compete in the video game console space. Would you be down for a Google Console? And more importantly, will you be able to play Fortnite Crossplay on it? All this and more on another episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	46000	Hello, my friends, and welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, July the 1st of 2018, episode number 736 of our show.
46000	57000	Happy Canada Day to all of our pals up north. Happy We're Back night because we were off last week. No better way to celebrate a birthday of OLR than taking a week off.
57000	69000	But we're back to start another year full of Orange Lounge Radio episodes after our 16th birthday two weeks ago. With you in studio, myself, Rob Roberts, and with me, as always, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
69000	70000	Oh, hi.
70000	71000	Hello, hello.
71000	72000	Hello.
72000	75000	Thank you for cat-sitting Mr. Smoosh while I was away in Chicago. Appreciate it.
75000	76000	He was a good kitty.
76000	80000	Had a very good time, and I brought you back some candy.
80000	82000	Yes, and I'm going to have some right now.
82000	85000	Good. Those little, so what do you call this place? Vosges?
85000	89000	V-O-S-G-E-S.
89000	95000	Okay, so I'm assuming, they don't have them here. I'm assuming it's a thing in Chicago or maybe generally the Midwest.
95000	100000	Actually, I did find that there's supposed to be one in New Orleans, and I think there's one in Southern California.
100000	101000	Oh, okay.
101000	102000	But I didn't know about it.
102000	104000	So maybe Southern California. So not really close to here.
104000	105000	Oh my God, it smells so good.
105000	111000	But anyway, those peanut butter things I bought, those are the best things I've ever had in my entire life, as far as candy goes.
111000	115000	So I'm really excited for Jamie to try one here on air. So she's going to open that box.
115000	123000	I will say this too about Jamie is that she went with me to accompany me right before I left for Chicago,
123000	132000	because she's been an owner of one of these devices, and I finally bit the bullet and bought myself for my birthday an Apple Watch.
132000	136000	I said I would never get on the Apple Watch train, and here I am. I finally bought one.
136000	140000	You know what finally did it for me? You know what finally brought me over to the dark side?
140000	144000	All the exercise motivating that it does.
144000	149000	And I have to admit, the whole bugging me to stand up and all that stuff is actually really motivating.
149000	152000	Speaking of exercise, time for candy. So you're going to eat one of these?
152000	154000	Got sea salt on top. Let's take a bite.
154000	156000	Alright, so she's going to eat one right now.
156000	157000	Oh, fucking hell.
157000	158000	Right?
162000	164000	Aren't those amazing?
164000	168000	Praise Jesus. Now that I don't even believe in Jesus.
168000	176000	Leave it to the resident Jewish girl here on the show to say praise Jesus for fighting into a chocolate.
176000	181000	I love it. Alright. Yeah, I know. I know. I know. Alright.
181000	182000	Fucking A.
182000	187000	While she's indulging in that, you need to, you need to put those, you know what you need to do?
187000	193000	You need to put those in a glass case, dark Sakura, which is like in case of shark week, break glass.
193000	195000	And then you have those ready to go.
195000	200000	Girl, it's so rich. I'm just going to sit here in the afterglow and smoke a cigarette.
200000	202000	Alright. Sounds good. Just blow the smoke outside.
202000	206000	Alright. Say hello to tech master. Loki is also here. Hi, Loki.
206000	207000	Hi.
207000	210000	Hi. You may have to try to bribe your way to one of those chocolates later.
210000	211000	I know you don't usually eat food.
211000	212000	Is it chocolate and peanut butter?
212000	213000	It's chocolate and peanut butter.
213000	214000	Yes.
214000	215000	I fucking hate chocolate and peanut butter.
215000	217000	God damn it, Loki. You hate everything.
217000	220000	I did bring something else though that Loki might be interested in.
220000	221000	What's that?
221000	222000	Honey butter potato chips.
222000	224000	I'll try some of those. That sounds good.
224000	226000	Maybe. That's just like weird.
226000	227000	They're really fucking good.
227000	230000	If it's not meat, Loki doesn't care. You know how to get Loki?
230000	235000	It tastes like the honey butter from, um, what was that salad place we used to have out here?
235000	238000	Not sweet tomatoes, but, uh, the soup.
238000	239000	Fresh choice.
239000	240000	Fresh choice.
240000	241000	Yeah.
241000	242000	Yeah.
242000	243000	It's really good.
243000	244000	It is good. Anyway.
244000	248000	But you, you brought dinner tonight from one of those make your own pizza places that they're
248000	250000	like, where did these things come from?
250000	252000	Like, it's like overnight we have, what is it?
252000	256000	The pizza rev, the pyology, the mod pizza, like all these.
256000	257000	Yeah.
257000	260000	Somebody took the idea of a Chipotle and applied it to pizza.
260000	262000	All these places popped up like overnight.
262000	263000	It's crazy.
263000	266000	And it's just like, I didn't really necessarily want anything fancy.
266000	271000	I just wanted pepperoni, you know, but I added a few extra things on top of it.
271000	272000	Garlic.
272000	275000	But honestly, they're like, I like my LG better.
275000	276000	Like, I don't know.
276000	279000	This is the first time I've had mod pizza and it's just kind of, it's all right.
279000	280000	They're really all the same to me.
280000	284000	They really, they're not all the same because they had different sauces and stuff and that stuff
284000	285000	does make a difference.
285000	286000	All right.
286000	291000	Uh, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com because part of what part of what makes Warren
291000	295000	songs radio special is the fact that we have been broadcasting live over the past 16 years.
295000	300000	And we're always with you guys in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and you can chat
300000	305000	along with the show and say things like calling me a sheep, which some people are doing about
305000	306000	my new watch purchase.
306000	308000	To which I say, fuck them.
308000	310000	To which I say, suck it.
310000	311000	All right.
311000	315000	You know, you know what, know what people treat their technology like fucking religion
315000	320000	and you want to know what giving people shit about the technology that they like is just
320000	322000	as stupid as giving people shit for their religion.
322000	326000	I don't like, honestly, it's not that important to me.
326000	328000	I, if you want a Fitbit, get a Fitbit.
328000	331000	I realized the newer Fitbits do like a lot of the same shit.
331000	333000	If that's what you want, go ahead.
333000	334000	I don't care.
334000	336000	Like it doesn't.
336000	337000	Okay.
337000	340000	My Monique heart voice is kicking in here.
340000	344000	Um, but, uh, I just do what you want.
344000	345000	It's all good.
345000	347000	Just, you know, I just chose to get the Apple watch.
347000	351000	I definitely wanted my rainbow band, which Jamie helped hook me up with.
351000	354000	And then I have the little, the little face on the watch that does a little dancing rainbow
354000	355000	too.
355000	359000	I got robbed for his birthday and I fed him and bought me.
359000	360000	Yes.
360000	361000	I appreciate it.
361000	362000	Let's see.
362000	364000	Also looking in chat at live.vog network.com.
364000	365000	Uh, let's see.
365000	369000	A rage in here talking about Loki hating chocolate and peanut butter together.
369000	370000	Yeah, I just don't.
370000	372000	I like them both individually.
372000	376000	I just don't like the combination saying, uh, of course, Loki hates everything.
376000	377000	He's a gamer.
377000	379000	Gamers hate everything.
379000	380000	Remember?
380000	381000	I like both.
381000	382000	I just don't like the combination of flavors.
382000	383000	I'm sorry.
383000	391000	I like Nintendo switch and I like Xbox one, but how dare Minecraft put them together?
391000	393000	No, it's nothing like that.
393000	394000	Uh, let's see.
394000	398000	It is a little confusing to have two copies of Minecraft though on my switch now.
398000	399000	It is.
399000	402000	Uh, tiger call on chat says, can Rob make calls on his Apple watch?
402000	404000	I think so, but I have the one.
404000	405000	You absolutely can.
405000	407000	Yeah, but mine doesn't have the cellular cause I didn't need it.
407000	412000	Like I do have an iPhone, so I was like, well, I always have my iPhone, so I'm not worried
412000	414000	about the whole, like you have to be near it.
414000	417000	And I do notice they work pretty far apart still.
417000	419000	And it's not like your watch immediately shuts down.
419000	422000	If you get away from your phone, like it still tracks all the stuff.
422000	425000	And then the next time you're close to your phone, it kind of, I can leave my watch in
425000	429000	the living room and I have to be about a house and a half away outside through the building
429000	431000	before it realizes I don't have my phone with me.
431000	432000	Yeah, yeah.
432000	433000	Same, same, same thing at work.
433000	437000	So anyway, uh, let's see, we're going to get into, uh, some news stories here.
437000	441000	In fact, I want to get into our kickoff topic tonight, uh, where I want to talk about some
441000	444000	of the things that we missed last week while we weren't here.
444000	449000	Cause, uh, we did miss quite a few things last week, including official news that Yoshi
449000	452000	on the switch was delayed to 2019.
452000	454000	Everything's delayed to 2019.
454000	459000	Kind of, well, I mean, and not too surprising when you figure that it didn't make the E3
459000	462000	press conference and a lot of people were asking, where's Yoshi?
462000	467000	So the fact that it got delayed to 2019, probably not the biggest surprise in the world.
467000	472000	And honestly, is Nintendo doing anything different than the other companies?
472000	477000	Like practically all those games that Sony showed at their thing, except Spiderman are
477000	478000	2019 games.
478000	482000	So you know what, whatever is last of us to 2019 as well.
482000	485000	I believe I don't think they've committed to a date yet.
485000	486000	Have they?
486000	487000	I don't know.
487000	488000	Anyway.
488000	489000	Um, let's see.
489000	494000	Also, uh, I guess, uh, captain toad treasure tracker, speaking of Nintendo news, the world's
495000	500000	dedicated to super Mario three D world are being replaced by super Mario Odyssey ones,
500000	501000	which, okay.
501000	505000	So it's not going to be a direct port of captain toad on Wii U.
505000	507000	Why not just put both in there?
507000	508000	That's true.
508000	509000	Why not?
509000	510000	Oh, let's just take it out.
510000	511000	Why?
511000	512000	Maybe there'll be DLC.
512000	513000	I don't know.
513000	514000	Who knows?
514000	515000	Uh, let's see.
515000	522000	Nintendo and Disney are teaming up to make a Nintendo switch themed game show.
522000	524000	Nintendo switch family showdown.
524000	529000	It is a new show that's going to be on the Disney channel, Disney XD, and I think online
529000	533000	the Disney or the Disney now streaming out cause you know, everybody has their own fucking
533000	534000	streaming app in this day and age.
534000	539000	So anyway, four families will battle it out for points and prizes by playing Nintendo
539000	540000	switch games against each other.
540000	544000	So it's kind of like, I guess like a modern day Nick arcade meets family double dare
544000	545000	or something.
545000	546000	I don't know.
546000	549000	Which by the way, speaking of game shows and speaking of double dare, Loki, I know you
549000	550000	had to have watched the new one.
550000	552000	I didn't watch the new one, but I know it came back.
552000	553000	Yeah, no, it did come back.
553000	554000	I didn't watch it either.
554000	559000	Cause I was, I have no, I don't have Nickelodeon, so I don't really, I will know cause we don't
559000	560000	have cable.
560000	561000	I thought, Oh, so I was like Nickelodeon.
561000	563000	I thought it was a part of like basic cable.
563000	564000	Okay.
564000	565000	No, it's not actually basic.
565000	566000	No.
566000	569000	Basic cable is your local channels and that's it.
569000	570000	All right.
570000	573000	Well anyway, um, I know a lot of people were looking forward to the double dare.
573000	576000	I like that they have a new host and they have Mark Summers.
576000	578000	I liked that they kind of used both.
579000	583000	I thought that was a good way to kind of nod to the classic, but still keep it like very
583000	584000	modern.
584000	590000	So anyway, back to the Disney game show, uh, searching for collectibles in Mario Odyssey
590000	594000	might be one round head to head Mario tennis aces, just dance, dance off.
594000	596000	So that'll be a hoot and a holler.
596000	597000	Anyway.
597000	598000	I don't know.
598000	599000	That sounds really stupid.
599000	602000	It's, it's going to be a family game show.
602000	607000	I get it, but it's just, it's hard to ignore the just product.
607000	612000	It's, it's just, it's like an advertisement break man in chat wants to know, uh, when
612000	613000	is that coming out?
613000	615000	Probably 2019 like everything else probably.
615000	617000	I don't think it's this year.
617000	620000	I just took a bite of my other chocolate.
620000	621000	So, okay.
621000	623000	So not to derail, but that's what Jamie does.
623000	627000	So you opened the other chocolate bar that I brought you, which was what it was a stout
627000	628000	chocolate bar.
628000	631000	It's a burnt caramel smoke and stout, but it doesn't taste like caramel.
631000	632000	So it's good.
633000	638000	Um, but I can get the stout taste in it cause chocolate and Guinness are amazing together.
638000	642000	It's got like a cream in it and you have to let me try like a little bite at some point
642000	643000	just cause I'm curious.
643000	644000	Super curious.
644000	645000	All right.
645000	646000	Anyway, go ahead and have some.
646000	648000	I'm trying to do a show here.
648000	651000	Girl, put this in your mouth and eat it.
651000	652000	If you insist.
652000	653000	All right.
653000	654000	Hold on.
656000	657000	Okay.
657000	658000	That is pretty fucking good.
658000	659000	Right.
659000	660000	You want some?
660000	661000	That's pretty amazing.
661000	662000	Moki hates everything you forgot.
662000	663000	All right.
663000	665000	I would still be ready to find it and offer.
665000	669000	Um, the cross platform debates heat up.
669000	672000	I think we're going to get into it a little bit on tonight's show as well.
672000	676000	But, um, I think you guys probably saw the commercial that showed up, uh, on Twitter
676000	677000	at least.
677000	679000	I think it's, um, around social media and stuff.
679000	680000	The whole survive together.
680000	686000	There's a Minecraft ad that's full on Microsoft and Nintendo did this ad together and there's
686000	688000	an Xbox player and a Nintendo player.
688000	691000	And it's really cute because the Xbox player is wearing green, the Nintendo players weren't
691000	692000	playing red.
692000	697000	It's, isn't it interesting how like we have the three, like, I know they're not the three
697000	698000	primary colors.
698000	701000	I guess they're the three light colors, red, green, blue, right?
701000	704000	Cause I know primary is red, yellow, blue, but Xbox is green.
704000	707000	Nintendo is now red and Sony is blue.
707000	711000	So we have a green and a red commercial that came together and it says survive together.
711000	712000	It's really cute.
712000	713000	Did you see the commercial?
713000	714000	Yes.
714000	715000	Yeah.
715000	717000	So it's a, and then of course that led to all these parodies where people were making
717000	722000	like a blue screen that said survive alone, you know, things like that kind of taking
722000	723000	jabs at Sony.
723000	728000	But anyway, uh, an ex Sony developer said that the PlayStation four console cross platform
728000	731000	block is all about the money.
731000	733000	Uh, duh.
733000	738000	We all know it's about greed and we all know it's about Sony just trying to sit on their
738000	739000	little throne.
739000	744000	But the problem is this little reputation is going to hurt them in the long, the long
744000	746000	game is not good with a strategy.
746000	747000	That's the problem with this.
747000	752000	People are going to fucking remember this when the Xbox two isn't, I'd call it, we all
752000	756000	know it's not going to be called that, but when the next Xbox is announced, Sony can't
756000	761000	stick to these types of rules or they're only going to allow Microsoft to punch them the
761000	766000	way that they punched Microsoft at E3 a few years ago when they first failed PS4.
766000	770000	So just look out Sony, don't do this.
770000	771000	All right.
771000	775000	Anyway, uh, let's see other news from last week.
775000	777000	Final Fantasy seven remake.
777000	779000	It is still happening.
779000	783000	Tetsuya Nomura expressing a little regret that they announced it so early, but they
783000	788000	kind of had to because of all the rumors and talk, you know, uh, also they're saying the
788000	793000	remake will dive deeper into avalanche members and other characters, which makes me think
793000	798000	that this isn't so much a remake as it is a re-imagining if they're expanding on certain
798000	801000	elements of the story and changing things like this.
801000	803000	That's not really a remake, is it?
803000	806000	Remakes can be, you know, covering different stuff.
806000	807000	I guess that's true.
807000	808000	I guess so.
808000	810000	But doesn't that seem more like a re-imagining Logie?
810000	815000	Maybe a little bit, but I hope that they have more like the advent children's stuff in there.
815000	816000	Yeah.
816000	817000	Let's go even beyond the story.
817000	820000	Uh, some thoughts in our chat at live.vognetwork.com.
820000	824000	Uh, as Joe and Hunter Matt said, they needed to announce it before Walmart Canada announced
824000	825000	it.
825000	826000	Very true.
826000	830000	Uh, JD says maybe they're pulling in some of the prequel games like crisis core before
830000	831000	crisis.
831000	833000	Oh, so kind of like alluding to some of the other things that happen in the side stories.
833000	837000	That's a good, a billion of side story games that they had good call out, I suppose.
837000	844000	Uh, and then one of the biggest stories that came out the week we were gone, uh, evil G
844000	847000	or GameStop, but we sometimes call them evil G.
847000	851000	Uh, they're in talks with private firms about a buyout.
851000	854000	So it looks like you also heard the other story though too.
854000	855000	What's that?
855000	856000	They're going to carry comics.
856000	858000	Yeah, I did hear that too.
858000	862000	So GameStop is definitely having to change a little bit probably because of the ramp
862000	865000	up in more and more games being distributed digitally.
865000	870000	So they're not content with putting the, the local, uh, video game stores out of business.
870000	873000	They're also now aiming for the jugular for the comic book industry.
873000	877000	They're trying to, they're basically trying to diversify cause there's no margin in games.
877000	883000	And so even with game sales, you know, and I imagine even less so with digital stuff,
883000	885000	they're not making a lot of money on that.
885000	888000	And I'm guessing that maybe the used market's not what it used to be.
888000	892000	And so now they're making money from other things that are higher margin, like, you know,
892000	896000	collectibles, 50% pop figures.
896000	897000	It is, it is.
897000	902000	And you know, judging by my kids and stuff, most of their attention was on all the collectible
902000	906000	stuff that they had there and not so much the games.
906000	909000	So these are basically going to become nerd stores across America.
909000	913000	It's probably like a, like a hot topic, but just gaming centric.
913000	914000	Interesting.
914000	916000	Isn't that box lunch?
916000	918000	Box lunch is actually a lot better than hot topic.
918000	920000	I like, I like box lunch a lot personally.
920000	921000	Yeah.
921000	922000	I have the stuff in there.
922000	924000	They had a Retsuko shirt I want, but they wanted like 40 bucks for it.
924000	925000	So whatever.
925000	926000	Do they have those?
926000	929000	I don't know if everybody in our chat would know what that store is, but it's in like,
929000	934000	if you go to this place called the mall, which most towns still have them, not all.
934000	935000	Wait, wait, wait.
935000	936000	Sorry.
936000	937000	It's where your Sears used to be.
937000	939000	A line from a movie pops in my head.
939000	944000	He took us to something called the mall and something called credit cards.
944000	945000	Sorry.
945000	946000	Is Bill and Ted's excellent.
946000	947000	Oh my God.
947000	948000	That's, that's a throwback.
948000	949000	I was thinking mall rats.
949000	956000	If you want to see like malls at their heyday height, go check out mall rats with Jay and
956000	957000	silent Bob.
957000	959000	Pay attention to the name of the stores.
959000	960000	Yeah.
960000	963000	And see if you can see the stereo image.
963000	964000	Anyway.
964000	965000	Uh, where were we?
965000	966000	Oh yes.
966000	967000	GameStop malls.
967000	968000	Yeah.
968000	973000	Oh, and also, you know, along the lines of GameStop looking for a buyer, you know, Toys
973000	978560	R Us is officially closed now that I saw the memes of the Jeffrey with his bags packed,
978560	983120	ready to go and all the, you know, because I missed the last day, I was hoping to go
983120	984800	like one more time before they closed.
984800	986360	They didn't really have anything in there though.
986360	987840	I guy looked, there was nothing.
987840	991800	I did not set foot into a Toys R Us one time during that entire sale.
991800	994340	What do I win?
994340	996600	You win not getting stuff for really cheap.
996600	997600	No.
997600	1000040	Well, isn't it all going to end up at the dollar store now anyway?
1000040	1001600	No, they'd sold it off.
1001600	1005760	I mean, well I think like a lot of like, especially like I was looking at Legos, so a lot of Lego
1005760	1006760	stuff that was there.
1006760	1011480	I think the local hobby shop that sells Legos bought most of that because you know, it's
1011480	1012480	50% off.
1012480	1013480	That reminds me.
1013480	1014480	I got you something.
1014480	1016000	You know, they could throw the markup stuff.
1016000	1017000	Oh yeah.
1017000	1018000	The Lego tape stuff.
1018000	1019000	That's awesome.
1019000	1020000	It was like the last one they had.
1020000	1021000	What is that?
1021000	1022000	It's tape.
1022000	1024680	You like stick it on your wall and you can stick stuff to it.
1024680	1025680	That's cool.
1025760	1026760	Thank you.
1026760	1031880	Um, but yeah, they, I saw, I got like a nice sign, you know, save like 80 bucks off of
1031880	1032880	it.
1032880	1033880	Huh?
1033880	1037080	I bought one of those and I bought Jenga, but it was like not real Jenga.
1037080	1041520	They had like my, uh, I was speaking with my mom yesterday and she went there and bought
1041520	1044600	Christmas gifts for the kids because they had a lot of stuff and there was a lot of
1044600	1048280	like big ticket items that my kids wanted and I'm like, I wish this was cheaper.
1048280	1052120	Um, so I was waiting for it to go cheaper and that's why it was actually, that was my
1052120	1055080	next trip was going to be is buying that stuff for Christmas.
1055080	1058280	So maybe she took care of that.
1058280	1062360	Um, something that I noticed in our little, uh, thread where we compile all the stories
1062360	1066680	where a dark Tetsuya helps us out and some of our story compilation for each show, uh,
1066680	1071000	he kind of called this out as a piece from last week that he thought was worth mentioning
1071000	1075800	and dark soccer since this has to do with retro games, namely SNK, I think this is something
1075800	1079680	that probably be up your alley, but you know how they're doing this SNK 40th anniversary
1079680	1081440	collection that's coming out later this year.
1081440	1084740	That's kind of like the, you know, all the old school games in one package.
1084740	1090920	Apparently, uh, some of the games have been redesigned to work as twin stick games because
1090920	1096200	some games, well, some games originally had a rotary control, so that can't be replicated
1096200	1100100	on a controller because the rotary is kind of unique in its design.
1100100	1105460	So what happened is that, you know, the ports were mapping buttons to rotate clockwise or
1105460	1107660	counterclockwise and it just didn't work.
1107660	1111240	So now the games play as twin stick basically.
1111240	1115800	So instead of, you know, turn it, you basically have one to point, I guess like, uh, you know,
1115800	1116800	playing like what?
1116800	1119100	Smash TV, robotron, those types of games.
1119100	1120100	So that's kind of cool.
1120100	1121100	That's pretty cool.
1121100	1122100	Yeah.
1122100	1125280	So, uh, I developed, I was already sold on this collection anyway, cause I'm a sucker
1125280	1127080	for retro compilations.
1127080	1130220	So that just makes me, uh, all the more interested in this.
1130220	1131220	That's for sure.
1131220	1132760	So there you go.
1132760	1137920	So that's a little bit of what y'all missed last week while we were off.
1137920	1140820	You also missed Rob's birthday.
1140820	1141820	That's right.
1141820	1142820	Yes.
1142820	1145180	My 40th birthday was on Monday.
1145180	1146580	Tuesday was on Tuesday.
1146580	1147580	Yeah.
1147580	1148580	I'm at that age where I forget.
1148580	1149580	Yeah.
1149580	1150580	My 40th birthday was Tuesday.
1150580	1152220	Your 40 Stravaganza.
1152220	1153220	I didn't forget.
1153220	1160220	So I figured, you know, as a gift to not only the listeners, but to Rob, you know, okay.
1160220	1165200	So because I, it's more for Rob, but you know, the listeners I'm sure can enjoy, you know,
1165200	1167500	being that I have no idea what's coming by the way.
1167500	1169980	He is not, he just said that there's a birthday present.
1170140	1171140	Yes.
1171140	1173900	And, and, and Bobby will appreciate this.
1173900	1177340	So I'll be right back and I'll bring you one in.
1177340	1178340	Okay.
1178340	1180340	Oh Lord.
1180340	1182220	Did he, he hid something.
1182220	1183680	He's bringing you ahead.
1183680	1184680	I know.
1184680	1185680	I'm fucking scared.
1185680	1187780	That means it was too big to hide.
1187780	1188940	So he dropped it in the living room.
1188940	1189940	Oh my God.
1189940	1190940	This is gigantic.
1190940	1191940	What the fuck is this?
1191940	1192940	Oh my God.
1192940	1193940	Oh shit.
1193940	1194940	Oh my God.
1194940	1195940	I'm scared.
1195940	1196940	This is.
1196940	1197940	What?
1197940	1202260	I figured since you've been putting it off for too long, it's about time that you got
1202260	1206040	on the whole VR craze.
1206040	1210820	So not only you got that, but also one of my favorite games on the system, which is
1210820	1216020	uh, until Don Russia, he bought me a PS VR, I can't believe it.
1216020	1217020	And it does.
1217020	1218020	Yep.
1218020	1219020	It has Skyrim.
1219020	1220020	Cool.
1220020	1221020	They all have Skyrim nowadays.
1221020	1222020	Thank you so much.
1222020	1223020	Oh my God.
1223020	1224020	I'm like speechless.
1224020	1225020	It's great.
1225020	1226020	You know, who's going to be mad at you though?
1226020	1227020	What?
1227100	1231420	Because just to, just before I left for Chicago, I was like, Oh, when I get back from Chicago,
1231420	1233380	I'll look into buy your PS VR.
1233380	1234380	Oops.
1234380	1235380	Oops.
1235380	1237860	No, I love it.
1237860	1239380	Oh, there's something else in here.
1239380	1240380	Yeah.
1240380	1241380	Until Dawn.
1241380	1242380	Cause it sets.
1242380	1243380	Oh no.
1243380	1244380	It's a great game.
1244380	1246740	Oh no.
1246740	1247740	I love it though.
1247740	1248740	Thank you.
1248740	1249740	Look, you really did.
1249740	1250740	I know these things aren't cheap.
1250740	1251740	Thank you so much.
1251740	1252740	Holy shit.
1252740	1253740	No problem.
1253740	1254740	Wow.
1254740	1256020	So I figured it'd be fun because you know, you do the streaming stuff and everything.
1256020	1257380	So Oh, for sure.
1257380	1260380	And I am super looking forward to Tetris effect.
1260380	1261380	Exactly.
1261380	1262380	That was finally the thing.
1262380	1263380	Well, let me go.
1263380	1264380	Okay.
1264380	1265380	I have games already.
1265380	1266380	So you have rez.
1266380	1267380	Yep.

1268380	1269380	Oh my God.
1269380	1270380	I'm so excited.
1270380	1271380	Yeah.
1271380	1272380	Super excited.
1272380	1274380	Looking in chat over at live.vog network.com.
1274380	1278100	Uh, as 200 Matt says, Mr. Smoosh is like a new thing.
1278100	1279100	That's mine now.
1279100	1280100	Yep.
1280100	1281100	Uh, blowing shit up.
1281100	1284140	Man says everybody gets a Skyrim and dark Tetsuya says, Oh man, I want to see that on
1284140	1285140	Twitch.
1285260	1286260	You got it.
1286260	1288300	We'll do, we'll do some Twitch streams for the PS4 later this week.
1288300	1292220	I can't, I can't do it tonight cause I'm not going to get set up that fast, but uh, this
1292220	1293220	week for sure.
1293220	1294220	That's great.
1294220	1295220	Oh my God.
1295220	1296220	Thank you so much.
1296220	1297220	They have most of the games are digital.
1297220	1299020	So you have to get some digital games.
1299020	1303180	Like I just, I picked up like some stuff this week by seven played it yet.
1303180	1310140	Uh, just in time ink, which is kind of a cross between like if you think, um, super hot and
1310140	1311520	job simulator.
1311520	1315720	So you, you're trying to stop people from dying from tragedies.
1315720	1317940	And so it's, it's hilarious though.
1317940	1321560	So like I really want to play that, but that'd be a great like streaming game right there.
1321560	1327460	Uh, rage nator in chat says, now that Rob Roberts has a PSVR, I have to ask the million
1327460	1328460	dollar question.
1328460	1332240	What is the TTP with the PSVR?
1332240	1333660	First off, you nasty.
1333660	1336920	Second off, how do you know it hasn't already happened?
1336920	1339960	Just don't be nasty.
1340200	1341920	Maybe I'll do a Twitch stream with no pants.
1341920	1342920	You'll never know.
1342920	1343920	You'll never know.
1343920	1344920	All right.
1344920	1345920	Anyway.
1345920	1346920	Nasty, nasty.
1346920	1347920	Uh, let's see.
1347920	1352660	Uh, going to chat at live.vognetwork.com, uh, dungeon buster says I can only imagine
1352660	1354540	what it's like in VR, but I liked it.
1354540	1356040	Good luck on saving everyone.
1356040	1360460	Uh, tiger claw wants you to know is if you don't already Loki ready player one is coming
1360460	1363600	out digitally this Tuesday already pre-ordered the digital version.
1363600	1366680	Yeah, I'm in no hurry to get the digital version again.
1366680	1369360	I mean, I've already seen it like two or three times.
1369360	1371680	So yeah, okay.
1371680	1375360	I wanted to go see ant man and the loss this weekend.
1375360	1381620	However, I have been informed by my wife that the Whitney Houston documentary is coming
1381620	1383880	to theaters that same day.
1383880	1388280	So unfortunately I will be seeing that instead.
1388280	1399320	So, Oh, well, I'll have to see it on the weekend.
1399760	1404400	I still, I, I can't wrap my hand around that.
1404400	1408440	It's not about learning your spouse to see something they don't want to see.
1408440	1411440	I would take your wife to see the Whitney Houston documentary cause I would see that.
1411440	1412440	I didn't even know one was coming.
1412440	1415600	I knew there's a mr Rogers documentary that I want to see.
1415600	1416600	Yeah.
1416600	1417600	Maybe you guys can negotiate.
1417600	1418600	See that one.
1418600	1420320	But like if Dan was like, Hey, I'm going to go see this.
1420320	1421320	You want to go?
1421320	1425160	I'd be like, no, that's, that's with me.
1425160	1429160	That's Alan and scary movies when he wants to go see, I don't know what are the big scary
1429200	1430200	moves?
1430200	1431200	It, he wants to go see it.
1431200	1436520	I'm like, don't you have other friends locally that want to go see it like, you know, that
1436520	1437520	that's everything.
1437520	1438520	He's free.
1438520	1439520	All right.
1439520	1442120	I mean, I went and saw, was it the bodyguard musical and everything?
1442120	1445200	So I mean, I forgot with, uh, uh, who was it?
1445200	1446200	Crystal waters, right?
1446200	1447200	Or something?
1447200	1448200	No.
1448200	1449200	Uh, one of those divas from the nineties.
1449200	1450200	Right.
1450200	1451200	Here's somebody, but I don't remember who it was.
1451200	1452200	Yeah.
1452200	1453200	But it was all right.
1453200	1455200	I mean, it was okay.
1455200	1456200	Okay.
1456720	1458000	Was it right?
1458000	1459000	But it's okay.
1459000	1465000	Were you going to make it any way stop?
1465000	1469400	You want to know how many freaking drag queens I've heard do that song?
1469400	1470400	All of them.
1470400	1471400	All right.
1471400	1472400	All of them, Rob, all of them.
1472400	1476600	Let's get into how is your gaming week and the types of video games that you've been
1476600	1478120	playing this week?
1478120	1479120	Uh, dark soccer.
1479120	1480160	How was your gaming week?
1480160	1483160	I didn't play a damn thing except for the stuff I play on the phone.
1483160	1484880	You want to know why?
1484880	1487640	Because of awesome games done quick.
1487640	1496560	I'm also right now buying a legend of Zelda t-shirt, but anyway, back to this, um, I have
1496560	1500400	been playing Pokemon and I've been playing, um, idle pouring.
1500400	1506360	Um, but I really like, I watched the finale last night so I could watch the final fantasy
1506360	1510040	six play through and I really super enjoyed it.
1510040	1513040	And it was just so much memory on that, that I think I'm actually planning on starting
1513040	1519780	that up again, um, to play on my, um, um, my, uh, SNES classic.
1519780	1526080	So I'm thinking about it anyway, but that's really been about what I've been doing anyway
1526080	1533560	just because I really haven't wanted to do anything else.
1533560	1534560	All right.
1534560	1535560	Then we'll move on to Loki.
1535560	1541280	Um, I didn't play a whole ton of stuff this week, but I did play, um, I got luminous remastered.
1541280	1544600	So I played a little bit of that on the switch and it was fine.
1544600	1552960	Um, I tried a little bit of the new Minecraft for the switch, so it's kind of confusing
1552960	1553960	that.
1553960	1556680	So they have the Minecraft switch edition, which is its own thing.
1556680	1562400	And then the Minecraft that's kind of everybody, you know, the one that's tied in with, um,
1562400	1567640	Xbox live, the one that you can play cross platform on is its own thing, which is really
1567640	1568840	weird.
1568840	1573080	And then on top of that, like I don't really care for the port that they did for that one
1573080	1580320	because it's probably good on TV, but on the screen, they didn't account for the size of
1580320	1582120	the screen and the resolution.
1582120	1588200	So all of the text boxes are really small and it makes it kind of difficult to see what
1588200	1590200	you're doing in there.
1590200	1593040	I mean, whatever, that's a small nitpick, but it's kind of annoying.
1593040	1597280	It's like, ah, I kind of rather play the other one that would look much nicer, but whatever.
1597280	1602380	I just wish you had an option to like tweak some of that stuff, but whatever, it's, it's
1602380	1603380	all good.
1603380	1604560	The aquatic updates are pretty awesome.
1604560	1609200	I haven't really played too much of it on my PC, so I'll have to check that out.
1609200	1611160	But yeah, it was kind of fun.
1611160	1615560	Most of my time was playing Pokemon go just because I feel obligated now to get enough
1615560	1617840	gifts to send to everybody every single day.
1617840	1623840	And so it's the struggle, it's just like I have 11 friends and it's just like, dude,
1623840	1628880	I had to drive by all of these pokey stops to get stuff and it's just, you have to let
1628880	1630140	it go at some point.
1630140	1633800	Now again, I got into this on Bobby show a little bit.
1633800	1637160	I'm not trying to be that guy, but the reality is between the people I know that play ingress
1637160	1641580	between the people on Facebook, Twitter, I have 73 friends on Pokemon go.
1641580	1644240	So like I'm, I'm not going to be able to send out that many gifts a day.
1644240	1648480	I just, I just can't, like I physically cannot visit 73 pokey stops in a day and that's assuming
1648480	1651640	each stop gives me a gift, which is not even the case.
1651660	1656640	So I kind of have to prioritize like who are the local people that I'm more likely to raid
1656640	1659920	with and trade with because I want to increase those friendships faster.
1659920	1664320	It's like, I'll send gifts out to the long distance people as I can, but like, yeah,
1664320	1669840	Oh my God, I just, I don't get enough gifts and they did nerf it a bit cause you were
1669840	1674540	getting like a ton of stuff from those gifts and then now it's a little less, but I mean,
1674540	1675920	I'm still having trouble like key.
1675920	1680360	I've had to expand my inventory twice just to be able to keep up with everything and
1680360	1682760	it's still not enough.
1682760	1684200	I'm like, I'm trying to catch everything.
1684200	1688720	I literally am catching everything I see, even if I don't want it just to use up the
1688720	1692180	pokey balls and it's not enough.
1692180	1695720	I just can't, I can't throw enough of them away.
1695720	1698200	So that's what, that's why I played this week.
1698200	1699200	All right.
1699200	1703040	Um, my gaming week, uh, I've also played the brand new Luminous remastered on Nintendo
1703040	1704040	Switch.
1704040	1706280	I'll probably play it after the show tonight on the live streams.
1706280	1707280	That'll be fun.
1707280	1710920	Um, but, um, yeah, I'm, I'm a fan, obviously.
1710920	1713640	I love that they redid Luminous.
1713640	1717980	It is pretty much the original game, but this time, you know, I can play on my HDTV as opposed
1717980	1719480	to a little portable device.
1719480	1720480	So that's cool.
1720480	1724440	And like I realized that they did do a version of Luminous on Xbox 360, they did do a version
1724440	1728600	of it on PC, you know, so it's not like I haven't played Luminous on my TV before, but
1728600	1733420	it's the first opportunity to play those old skins, you know, shine in, move your body
1733420	1736000	and like, you know, those, those like older skins from that game.
1736040	1738280	Um, so it's really cool to get to experience all that again.
1738280	1740780	And the fact that it's on the Switch, you know, being portable and all that stuff.
1740780	1741780	Very cool.
1741780	1745120	So, uh, yeah, big fan of shine it or of shine it, of lumen.
1745120	1750600	I mean, what else is there in Luminous, it's shine in the game, but no, seriously, a big
1750600	1751620	fan of Luminous.
1751620	1757360	If you've never played it and you like puzzle games at all, you have to give this a try.
1757360	1760920	If you like music games, I kind of feel like you have to give this a try.
1760920	1765160	Now, if you're not a fan of puzzle games, then I don't think this one's going to win
1765160	1770120	you over, you know, because you're probably, you're probably going to look at it and go,
1770120	1771680	it's kind of like the same thing over and over.
1771680	1775040	Like if you can't see the value in a game like Tetris, then you're not going to see
1775040	1776720	it in Luminous either.
1776720	1780200	But like, have you seen, speaking of Tetris, by the way, have you guys seen some of the
1780200	1783560	gameplay that's out there now for Tetris effects because now that I don't know if critics have
1783560	1789600	a copy of it or somehow, like I know it was at E3, but like, there's like off the screen
1789600	1793400	or like a direct feed B roll stuff out there.
1793400	1797040	It is, it is Luminous, but Tetris.
1797040	1801240	It is like the exact same, like the themes and the block change after you get so many
1801240	1803080	like lines and stuff.
1803080	1807640	And the thing they did to Tetris, they made it so that you can stop time.
1807640	1812600	And so you can actually get up to 16 clears at one, you can get 16 lines at a time.
1812600	1813840	Pretty crazy stuff.
1813840	1815640	The expert Tetris player did.
1815640	1816640	Yes.
1816640	1817640	Yeah.
1817640	1819220	That's the same thing I saw that YouTube out there, which I guess a ton of people have
1819220	1820220	seen that.
1820460	1825180	Just Google or look on YouTube for Tetris effect expert player or something, and you'll
1825180	1829340	find this video and it has a lot of footage from the game and you can see the expert Tetris
1829340	1830340	player.
1830340	1833580	I think they showed like footage of him from like the NES world championships in the nineties
1833580	1834640	or something.
1834640	1839820	So he's in his forties now like me and he's like a Tetris master and he was playing that
1839820	1840820	game.
1840820	1845040	So, yeah, I'm so excited for Tetris effects, you guys and like Luminous is just like warming
1845040	1846040	me up to that.
1846040	1850620	Otherwise, I've also been playing a lot of Pokemon Go.
1850620	1854560	Same kind of deal that Loki was talking about, except, you know, just trying to get all the
1854560	1855560	presents I can.
1855560	1859160	So again, if you're my friend in Pokemon Go and I haven't been sending you enough gifts
1859160	1862240	or opening your gifts, I am sorry.
1862240	1865000	Blame Niantic for only letting me open 20 a day.
1865000	1869840	They should still let you open gifts, even if you only get like a Pokeball or a potion
1869840	1873920	or just like experience or something like just a little something to let you open all
1873920	1874920	your gifts would be great.
1874920	1876640	At least you can send out unlimited.
1876640	1879620	But again, trying to try to get that many is a beast.
1879620	1884820	But I am trying to prioritize people that like I raid with, I trade with that are like
1884820	1887420	local where I'm going to see those benefits.
1887420	1891480	So sorry about that anyway.
1891480	1892480	Let's see.
1892480	1895720	And then there's no shiny Roselia, though, which disappoints me.
1895720	1896720	I've been trying.
1896720	1898960	I don't really like that Pokemon in the beginning.
1898960	1900960	They're like, OK, there's a shiny one out there.
1900960	1905280	Just like everyone I've seen is like not shiny by not a shiny by.
1905280	1909220	Well, I guess the reason why they did that is this safari zone event they're doing in
1909220	1913600	Europe right now, which is kind of like Europe's own community day sort of thing.
1913600	1918360	I guess it's happening at a rose garden or it's some type of like botanical gardens.
1918360	1920120	So that's that's why they did Roselia.
1920120	1921120	Yes, it makes sense.
1921120	1923160	I just, you know, I can't evolve it.
1923160	1929080	So it's like, well, I mean, not yet, but it's a Gen Gen four or five has a evolve.
1929080	1930440	I think it's Gen four.
1930440	1934800	Gen four has so many like game breaking Pokemon for the current system.
1934800	1938520	Like this is why we're having to wait a little bit for Gen four, because I think Gen four
1938520	1941180	is going to require a rebalance of everything.
1941180	1944800	And so I'm not sure how popular that's going to be.
1944800	1947980	Act Deft in our chat room points out at live dot vog network dot com.
1947980	1951380	The go fest shinies are going to be minion and plusle.
1951380	1955720	So the little the little battery pikachus, you all know which ones those are right.
1955720	1956720	Plus minus pikachus.
1956720	1959960	Yeah, those are the ones that are going to be shiny for Chicago.
1959960	1964120	But they'll be it'll be worldwide like the Roselia was, but they're so weak.
1964120	1965700	I know they're not my favorite either.
1965700	1967040	And I don't think those do evolve.
1967040	1968440	I don't think those ever go anywhere.
1968440	1970200	I'd I could be wrong.
1970200	1973760	Chatters, Pokemon experts, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I've been catching a
1973760	1976160	lot of those too lately, but it's just like they're so weak.
1976160	1977680	Yeah, I don't think they go in.
1977680	1980440	They don't go into the Pikachu chain at all.
1980440	1981440	They're kind of separate.
1981440	1983440	So let's see.
1983440	1988720	S.J. 100 Matt says spots that don't get too much pogo traffic have better odds of getting
1988720	1989720	shinies.
1989720	1990720	Interesting.
1990720	1995380	I thought kind of the friends list was an interesting way to help players in rural areas.
1995380	1999440	Because you know, if I know people that are in rural areas that don't get to spin pokestops,
1999440	2001840	imagine getting to open 20 gifts in a day.
2001840	2004240	Like you're able to get gear, which is nice.
2004240	2009720	So anyway, other games I've been playing this week still playing Diablo three.
2009720	2014840	So my seasonal character I mentioned before the last show, I wasn't 70 yet.
2014840	2019440	So now I'm 70 Paragon 300 plus I hit Paragon 300 earlier today.
2019440	2025400	So thanks to some of Grandpa from Hoard House or Captain Matt from Starboard Power Coupling.
2025400	2028040	Thanks to his friends for power leveling.
2028040	2032180	We were doing like level 75 greater rifts.
2032180	2036680	I gained 64 Paragon levels in one run.
2036680	2037680	One of those was crazy.
2037680	2038680	So that was fun.
2038680	2043200	And then I've been playing more Heroes of the Storm again because they suckered me into
2043200	2047840	watching it on Twitch to get more of the loot chest drops, which in turn made me want to
2047840	2049320	play Heroes of the Storm more.
2049320	2050720	So that's that.
2050720	2053740	Oh, and one more Overwatch.
2053740	2056680	I actually checked out Overwatch for the first time this week in a long time because of all
2056680	2057680	the Symmetra rework.
2057680	2060160	They did a big Symmetra rework.
2060160	2063600	They announced a new character on the PTR, which I know is coming up later in the show,
2063600	2067000	which Overwatch fans already know, but we'll talk about that later.
2067000	2069580	But I wanted to see the Symmetra reworking that they did.
2069580	2072680	So obviously I wasn't going to get to play her in quick match because people are picking
2072680	2074360	her like that to get to use her.
2074360	2076560	But I got to play around in a little test zone.
2076560	2079880	And then I went into a match as like Moira because I really love playing Moira.
2079880	2085360	She's a great, like kind of fun, like heal and slight damage person.
2085360	2089840	So yeah, I had a lot of fun playing her and I, I got, I did well enough that I got the
2089840	2093160	little reputation thingies that are new.
2093160	2094160	Is that what they're called?
2094160	2095160	I don't know.
2095160	2101220	They introduced, I think it's to try to counteract some of the toxicity in Overwatch is instead
2101220	2105000	of making a negative mark thing, they try to do a positive thing where you can basically
2105000	2107960	give like commendations to players who are really, really good.
2107960	2110480	I think that's, I think that's what they call it.
2110480	2114060	Maybe somebody in chat at live.vognetware.com knows what they really call it, but it's like
2114060	2117780	extra recognition to, to do a well and beyond.
2117780	2118780	And it goes on your profile.
2118780	2122460	Like the more of these you get, the more of these commendations you get, the more you
2122460	2124700	kind of level up on your profile, which is kind of cool.
2124700	2128560	So people, people are trying to be nice to get those endorsements.
2128560	2129560	Thank you.
2129560	2130560	I knew like, I was like, what were they called?
2130560	2131560	Yes.
2131560	2132560	Endorsements.
2132560	2133560	Thank you.
2133560	2134560	No, I think that is right.
2135120	2136120	This is my gaming week.
2136120	2137120	I've talked plenty enough.
2137120	2140800	So in this part of the show, I will remind you to check out our Twitter at twitter.com
2140800	2145620	slash O L R. We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
2145620	2148560	And that's all the housekeeping I have for you right now.
2148560	2150540	We will be here over the next few weeks.
2150540	2155620	There's no shows off planned until labor day because labor day weekend, I will be at dragon
2155620	2156620	con.
2156620	2161400	And if you are in the Southeast area or anywhere remotely near Atlanta, you should be making
2161400	2165200	plans to attend dragon con as well, because it's a whole lot of fun.
2165200	2170240	It looks very, very likely I will be doing some panels with the podcasting track.
2170240	2172680	Very likely there may be more than that this year.
2172680	2176520	So you'll just stay tuned, really excited at some of the prospects for this year's dragon
2176520	2177520	con.
2177520	2178520	So stay tuned for that.
2178520	2179760	Bobby Black Wolf will be there too.
2179760	2181320	He's doing a lot of stuff too.
2181320	2186880	And from my understanding is because you guys know a good friend that was here on the last
2186880	2189880	episode relocated to the East coast.
2189880	2193320	So extra first now on the East coast, but he only is going to live like six hours from
2193320	2194320	Atlanta.
2194320	2198320	So extra for maybe a dragon con this year, I'm trying to try to get him to come.
2198320	2199880	So we'll we'll see what happens.
2199880	2201160	I think it'll be fun.
2201160	2204160	So check that out anyway.
2204160	2209280	Let's get into some gaming news and some other things that have happened this week, Loki.
2209280	2216480	So you may remember that valve got rid of the API support for that was allowing steam
2216480	2218620	spy to work.
2218620	2224520	And mainly they had to kind of shut it off because of some of the GDPR European, I guess
2224520	2228080	guidelines for data privacy enforcement.
2228080	2230160	They had to stay in compliant with that.
2230160	2235840	And because of that, that's why, you know, all the various profiles are private, so they
2235840	2237720	can't really scrape that stuff.
2237720	2243280	So now they're basically saying, you know, that they're going to come up with something
2243280	2244640	to take its place.
2244640	2246800	That's going to be better.
2246800	2250880	Their quote, basically, our general approach has been to provide open API so that we don't
2250880	2257800	offer the amount of tools that we are when we don't offer the amount of tools that we
2257800	2258800	should.
2258800	2263920	The community can step in, which allows things like steam spy to happen.
2263920	2268860	However, that had a broad variance in how accurate it was.
2268860	2273400	It was very accurate for some games and inaccurate for a few others.
2273400	2278500	So they're hoping to fix the issue and create something that's better than steam spy to
2278500	2279580	replace it.
2279580	2285020	So yes, we're working on new tools and new ways to getting data out of steam.
2285020	2289580	And we hope that data can be more accurate and more useful than what seems by previously
2289580	2291000	offered.
2291000	2292620	So that sounds like a good thing.
2292620	2297220	And I guess we'll just wait and see when that happens because we're talking valve time here.
2297220	2301340	So you know, we might count to three.
2301340	2306980	We might be alive when that happens or we might not.
2306980	2307980	Who knows?
2307980	2308980	Do they even give a shit?
2308980	2314880	Because I mean, after all, it's just, it's just selling games.
2314880	2319060	I didn't really buy a whole lot on the steam sale or was that, that was recently wasn't
2319060	2320060	it?
2320060	2321060	It's still going.
2321060	2322060	Yeah.
2322060	2326920	You got, I, I've had, I had some strong words on steam past couple episodes.
2326920	2332160	So I'm not really jumping at the bit to, to promote their sale, but I understand.
2332160	2336680	And the reality is, you know, I'm, I bought a game that was very, very cheap.
2336680	2344600	I had to buy it for 4.1 because it was only 20 bucks instead of like 50 what it normally
2344600	2345600	is.
2345600	2347960	But I can still be a frustrated customer.
2347960	2348960	I haven't even looked at it.
2348960	2353400	I should probably look, there's, yeah, there's a lot of stuff, but people can be pissed.
2353400	2355360	So also can be pissed at me.
2355360	2357680	Well, no, well, I'll say this too though.
2357680	2361640	Keep in mind that usually when these types of sales happen, don't forget to check out
2361640	2365520	GOG itch IO, the other humble bundle, the other stores too, because they tend to do
2365520	2368360	response sales, especially around the 4th of July.
2368360	2372600	So, you know, I will say that don't feel like you have to put all your eggs in one basket.
2372600	2373600	Right.
2373600	2374600	Yeah.
2374600	2375600	So, all right.
2375600	2380160	And I did, I did check the others first, but they were, you know, earth defense forces
2380160	2381680	only on sale in the scene of store.
2381680	2382680	So yeah, it happens.
2383360	2384720	How to bite the bullet there.
2384720	2385720	All right.
2385720	2388760	Well, anyway, let's talk about Pokemon go again.
2388760	2389760	Yeah.
2389760	2393120	We won't talk about our weeks, but the reality is there's probably a lot of people talking
2393120	2394840	about Pokemon go right now.
2394840	2395840	Why?
2395840	2400800	Because it apparently is at its highest player count since the beginning of the game.
2400800	2405180	So obviously when the game first came out, like fucking everybody was playing it then
2405180	2409320	as some of the server issues and you know, they took away the radars, you know, they
2409320	2412580	were doing things that made some people kind of over it.
2412580	2415500	So it dropped way off, but it was far from dead.
2415500	2419140	It was never a dead game, despite what some sensationalist clickbait headlines would make
2419140	2420140	you believe.
2420140	2425020	And the reality is it's back from the dead, uh, this week it's doing very well.
2425020	2427220	This is based on a study from super data.
2427220	2430880	Apparently the game generated $104 million in may.
2430880	2435940	I don't know how they, they measure this, but I guess they can see some of the, uh,
2435940	2438180	the rankings and the different stores and stuff.
2438180	2440140	They kind of figure it out that way.
2440140	2444380	Um, the long awaited trading feature as well as friend feature.
2444380	2446720	This is being credited for that whole thing.
2446720	2449020	So, um, have you done any trading in?
2449020	2450020	I haven't.
2450020	2454100	No, I should, I should trade you a Pokemon cause if I trade you a Pokemon that I got
2454100	2458660	in Chicago, uh, you'll instantly get your bronze trading metal cause it's over a thousand
2458660	2459660	kilometers.
2459660	2460660	Oh yeah.
2460660	2461660	Kind of fun.
2461660	2462880	And I can trade you one too, Jamie, if you want.
2462880	2468340	So anyway, um, the also, uh, a lot of people coming back to Pokemon go because they're
2468340	2470700	getting ready for let's go Pikachu and Eevee.
2470700	2472740	I know there were some people that were coming back for that.
2472740	2475720	Uh, so yeah, the game is doing quite well.
2475720	2479540	So if you call it a dead game right now, you don't know what you're talking about.
2479540	2480540	Clearly.
2480540	2483500	Um, so I mean, props to them for bringing people back.
2483500	2485900	How long will it stay that high?
2485900	2486900	We'll see.
2486900	2490760	I think it'll probably taper off pretty quick again, but they've done a pretty good job
2490760	2494340	about doing these little things to kind of get people that are curious to pop on back
2494340	2495340	and check it out.
2495340	2496340	That's for sure.
2496340	2498100	So, uh, check that out.
2498100	2499100	Moving on.
2499100	2500100	Dark Sakura.
2500100	2501100	What do you have for us?
2501100	2505140	Uh, just finding out the Dragon Ball Fighter Z for the ultimate edition of 70 bucks on
2505140	2506140	steam right now.
2506140	2512820	No, but other than that, um, Google is, uh, doing shenanigans.
2512820	2518460	They're basically, well, at least the sources indicate that they are planning a gaming platform
2518460	2523100	to take on Microsoft, to take on Sony, to take on Nintendo.
2523100	2526220	Um, they want it to be a streaming platform.
2526220	2530600	They're creating hardware for it, and they're already working on bringing in developers
2530600	2535540	under Google, so, uh, they've been putting in some major recruiting and trying to acquire
2535540	2538180	their company, too.
2538180	2539180	Other companies.
2539180	2545740	Um, and basically the people who have been talking about this, um, have either been involved
2545740	2549060	in the issue or know people who have been involved in the issue.
2549060	2554980	Um, I mean, and they did try to acquire Twitch before Amazon stepped in, so we had that there.
2554980	2557260	So they've been thinking about this for a while.
2557260	2558260	Um.
2558260	2559840	Thank God that didn't happen.
2559840	2564420	The rumor was going on for a while that they wanted to do something based on Android, but
2564420	2566760	that didn't happen either.
2566760	2570100	So they're, they're trying to push through other things.
2570100	2574380	I mean, it's all been rumors before, but this one seems to be, have a lot more weight to
2574380	2575380	it.
2575380	2576380	So, we'll see.
2576380	2580900	How about you support your fucking platforms you already have, like my Android TV that
2580900	2583060	hardly has any fucking apps on it.
2583060	2584060	How about that shit?
2584140	2589100	Yeah, I can't help, but when I hear like Google gaming, my mind instantly goes to an Android
2589100	2592140	console and I go like, oh, so they're going to make an Ouya.
2592140	2594580	No, it's not going to be an Ouya.
2594580	2597020	I mean, I, I don't know.
2597020	2600500	So the streaming platform right now is code named Yeti.
2600500	2604700	Um, so we'll see if there's an accuracy to it.
2604700	2606620	Yeah, I'm not going to knock it till I've tried it.
2606620	2608300	You know, let's, let's see what games.
2608300	2609300	Right.
2609300	2610300	Right.
2610300	2611380	Dark Sakura, golden rule of OLR.
2611380	2614300	It's been a while, it's been a while since we've reminded the listeners about the golden
2614300	2615300	rule of gaming.
2615300	2618940	Dark Sakura, would you please, uh, educate the listeners of OLR what the golden rule
2618940	2619940	of gaming is?
2619940	2621740	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
2621740	2622740	That is correct.
2622740	2623740	With caveat.
2623740	2631740	It also depends on how well those games play because after having played the same game
2631740	2636100	on multiple consoles, some, some consoles will do it better.
2636100	2637100	Okay.
2637100	2638100	Fair enough.
2638100	2642220	In other words, PC is all you need because PC is going to do it lately.
2642220	2644260	It depends on your setup though.
2644260	2649420	PCs, gaming on PC is expensive and I don't want to get into the console versus PC debate.
2649420	2651140	I'm just being playful.
2651140	2654060	Uh, you got to do what works for you at the end of the day.
2654060	2658220	So well, and I came to this conclusion actually watching one of my favorite YouTube channels,
2658220	2660220	battle of the ports.
2660220	2665660	They talk about games that just look stellar on some consoles and play like shit.
2665700	2668380	So again, take all that into account.
2668380	2669380	Yep.
2669380	2672540	Especially with so much being multi-console in this day and age.
2672540	2673540	That's for sure.
2673540	2674540	Exactly.
2674540	2675540	Exactly.
2675540	2676540	All righty.
2676540	2677540	Uh, let's move on.
2677540	2678540	Loki, what do you have for us?
2678540	2682580	So here's something kind of fun and something we've been asking for for a while.
2682580	2687900	It's like, why these consoles, these modern consoles have USB ports in them.
2687900	2690220	Why don't they support mouse and keyboard?
2690220	2691220	Huh?
2691220	2692500	Why don't they?
2692500	2693500	No idea.
2693500	2698420	The controller does if the game does it because you can play a Final Fantasy 14 with keyboard
2698420	2699420	and mouse.
2699420	2700420	I do it.
2700420	2702500	Well, that's nice, but I'm talking about like other games.
2702500	2703500	I know.
2703500	2704500	I know.
2704500	2708260	I, but, but I'm just saying the system can support it, but for whatever reason, a lot
2708260	2713140	of games like Overwatch won't allow it because Blizzard views that as like tipping the balance
2713140	2716220	or I don't know what the fuck their problem is, but that's, you know, they don't, they,
2716220	2720500	they see that as an advantage over people playing on controller, I guess it's separated
2720500	2721500	out.
2721500	2722500	I don't know.
2722500	2727380	Um, but anyways, Microsoft is actually been working with razor to bring full mouse and
2727380	2730100	keyboard support to the Xbox one.
2730100	2736680	Apparently there's been some leaked documents about a presentation where they've been creating
2736680	2742980	some different, uh, devices to work with the Xbox one citing, they said that the turret
2742980	2751420	and black widow devices and, um, even with chroma light up keys and whatnot, funny enough,
2751420	2757820	I actually just got gaming, uh, a gaming PC and, or not PC, but a keyboard and mouse.
2757820	2763060	Cause now we have, uh, I set up like a home office thing for my laptop.
2763060	2767060	So I have a, you know, game of mouse and keyboard now with a, I got a Corsair keyboard and a
2767060	2768500	razor mouse.
2768500	2774000	So now I can try to do some mousey keyboard like everybody else and instead of using controller,
2774000	2775700	it's unnatural for me though.
2775700	2779740	So I don't like it, but I'll try it.
2779740	2782500	Um, interesting though.
2782500	2785740	It doesn't say any other details like when we might expect this.
2785740	2791740	Um, but I know they said basically, no Minecraft bedrock edition currently supports mouse and
2791740	2796860	keyboard and that's, you know, on all these platforms.
2796860	2799380	So I guess we'll have to wait and see.
2799380	2802360	I would be very curious how many of you are interested in something like this.
2802360	2807680	I always kind of thought when people want to use mouse and keyboard, they just go to,
2807680	2809200	you know, their computer.
2809200	2813280	You know, Xbox three 60 also cause final fantasy 11 also used keyboard, right?
2813280	2814280	Keyboard.
2814280	2815520	I don't know about mouse, but use keyboard.
2815520	2818120	So anyway, I mean, I don't know.
2818120	2822120	Like for more of these like MMO type games, maybe, uh, maybe if you really want to get
2822120	2826280	competitive like Overwatch or something like that and all you have as a console, you can't
2826280	2831280	afford, you know, to buy an expensive PC or something, maybe at least you can drop money
2831280	2835800	for a keyboard mouse and try to play better that way.
2835800	2836800	I don't know.
2836800	2837800	All right.
2837800	2839640	Let's talk about sexy band games.
2839640	2840640	Yay.
2840640	2841960	I love sexy band game.
2841960	2842960	All right.
2842960	2844800	So what is the latest sexy band game?
2844800	2847800	It's a game called Omega Labyrinth Z.
2847800	2851640	It was a game that was released for the PlayStation four and the PlayStation Vita.
2851640	2854400	So you know, I'm talking about Japan cause it was Vita supported.
2854400	2855600	Uh, this was a game.
2855600	2858360	It's a dungeon crawler, I guess.
2858360	2862040	But I mean when you look at like the graphics and stuff, it doesn't look like a dungeon
2862040	2863040	crawler.
2863040	2865720	That is official dungeon crawling garb.
2865720	2873480	I am sorry, but this, this school girls like F cup boobies are like, they're not just sticking
2873480	2874480	out.
2874480	2876840	They're sticking out and like going around her jacket.
2876840	2878460	That's not an F cup, Rob.
2878460	2880120	As one, I can tell you that's not an F cup.
2880120	2881120	Oh my God.
2881120	2882840	So what cup would that be?
2882840	2885400	That would be more like a double Z.
2885400	2888040	No, they actually do make double G.
2888040	2890000	It's, it's, it's H for hentai.
2890000	2891000	Okay.
2891000	2892560	It's H it's an H cup.
2892560	2893560	H for hentai.
2893560	2894560	I like that.
2894560	2895560	All right.
2895560	2896560	Anyway.
2896560	2900040	Uh, so apparently the localization of this game has been refused by Sony, uh, for North
2900040	2901560	America and Europe.
2901560	2904160	The game was being localized by P cube.
2904160	2905680	It's a UK based publisher.
2905680	2908200	Uh, and then I guess the localization has been announced.
2908200	2909200	It's been canceled.
2909200	2913280	Uh, and they put in a little statement over on Twitter.
2913280	2918360	Uh, basically they try to do Japanese content for its fans as close to the source material
2918360	2919360	as possible.
2919360	2924440	Uh, P cube try to work with the relevant age rating, uh, bodies and their respective territories,
2924440	2927320	and they have to comply with the wishes of the platform holder.
2927320	2928460	And so they just withdrew it.
2928460	2935360	So basically the game was too, too slutty with people that are too young, uh, to be
2935360	2936360	released.
2936360	2940240	Well, I mean, they could have changed the age to everyone.
2940240	2948120	That sucks that these platforms are just, you know, have no region code, all region
2948120	2949120	free anyway.
2949120	2950120	I dunno.
2950120	2955800	Anyway, I guess also, uh, the Britain video standards council refused a box release for
2955800	2961480	the game in the UK back in March because the player touches certain points on a female
2961480	2964400	character's body to arouse them.
2964400	2971560	A successful action will activate a shame break where parts of their clothing come off,
2971560	2973160	revealing more of their bodies.
2973160	2975280	Do they have shit like this on the 3DS?
2975280	2977040	I don't understand what the problem is.
2977040	2983500	The player places honey on the girl's bodies, a fantastical dog-like creature that proceeds
2983500	2988680	to lick the honey off of their bodies, which causes them to become aroused.
2988680	2989680	I'm laughing.
2989680	2991400	This is so fucking stupid.
2991400	2995900	Like the previous mini game, when they reach a certain level of arousal, parts of their
2995900	2998580	clothing fall off or vanish.
2998580	3003880	As the dog licks at the honey, the girls respond with sexualized language.
3003880	3008740	But of course the main problem is that it takes place in a high school.
3008740	3014080	And so that means the characters are probably not quite 18 or barely so.
3014080	3017720	So where is the labyrinth in like the dungeon crawling with this?
3017720	3022760	Because so far I'm hearing like there's a dog that's licking a girl.
3022760	3026680	I mean, where's the dungeon crawling here?
3026680	3030240	By the way, in some of the screenshots, we see one female character saying to another,
3030240	3034320	you there, your skirt is too short, fix it right now.
3034320	3038520	And another one, a little fairy type creature is saying, eh, well, you have to stroke it
3038520	3040920	between your breasts.
3040920	3043680	Jamie, would you play this game?
3043680	3044680	Maybe.
3044680	3055960	I just, I think that's ridiculous.
3055960	3061360	It's God forbid that God forbid we represent, you know, women getting aroused by something,
3061360	3065340	but let's just blow some fucking brains and have, have intestines falling out.
3065340	3066340	That's okay.
3066340	3067340	Here's the thing.
3067340	3068340	Here's the thing.
3068340	3069340	I get the age concern.
3069340	3070340	I don't want to invalidate that.
3070340	3073840	It is fucking creepy when it's high school kids at 16, 17.
3074480	3080840	If upon localization of the game, maybe they could be it's college and they're 20 years
3080840	3085960	old, you know, it's a little bit like less creepy than maybe, you know, this, some of
3085960	3088000	these concerns would probably be eased up a little bit.
3088000	3089000	I don't know.
3089000	3090000	It's also a cartoon.
3090000	3091000	They're not alive.
3091000	3094000	They don't have ages anyway.
3094000	3095000	I don't know.
3095000	3096600	It's more of the connotation of it.
3096600	3100200	Yeah, perhaps, perhaps blow those brains away.
3100200	3101200	That's fine.
3101700	3107640	It is ridiculous that people are far more concerned about violence than they are about,
3107640	3117040	um, I'm sorry, far less concerned about violence than they are about, um, sex or language or
3117040	3118440	it's, people are fucking stupid.
3118440	3124380	But if you want to play a game that oozes sexuality and femininity and is about adults,
3124380	3126020	play Bayonetta.
3126020	3130260	That's why I fucking love Bayonetta because there is room for excessiveness and over the
3130260	3131780	topness in video gaming.
3131780	3139420	Not everything has to be, you know, like a legit story, you know, like a Pulitzer Prize
3139420	3140980	writing script thing.
3140980	3146620	Like for in every movie, movie theater and every movie house and things, there's going
3146620	3149180	to be campy films.
3149180	3151300	There's going to be John Waters movies.
3151300	3155620	There's going to be the types of movies that Elvira watches and mystery science theater
3155620	3157360	3000 makes fun of.
3157360	3159180	There's a place in art for that type of stuff.
3159180	3160940	And that's where Bayonetta kind of fits for me.
3160940	3165300	Maybe we can get John Waters a telltale series.
3165300	3168580	Why hasn't John Waters a telltale game?
3168580	3170820	Pink Flamingos, the live adventure.
3170820	3171820	All right.
3171820	3176100	Anyway, they should just do a game called the quest for eggs.
3176100	3181620	Uh, over in our chat, over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, Bobby Black Wolf says, my wife walked
3181620	3187820	in right when you were describing this, she's wondering what I'm actually listening to.
3187820	3188820	Come on.
3188820	3189820	This isn't that stream.
3189820	3190820	My bad.
3190820	3191820	Sorry about that for us.
3191820	3196820	I mean, she couldn't tell my insanely nasally over the top voice describing this.
3196820	3198820	She couldn't tell it was me.
3198820	3203940	Uh, anyway, uh, dungeon buster says this sounds like a trash game, but to each their own,
3203940	3205820	here's the thing though.
3205820	3212460	Sometimes you want trash, like, can you explain to me why Taco Bell stays in business?
3212460	3215860	Because news flash, the food ain't good.
3215860	3218140	But sometimes you're craving trash.
3218140	3219140	No, no, no.
3219140	3222560	You're not craving Mexican food because Taco Bell is not Mexican food.
3222560	3226340	You're craving trash, right?
3226340	3229980	I had some friends that went to Waffle House for the first time today.
3229980	3231780	I fucking love Waffle House and it's not trash.
3231780	3236620	Shout out to Extifer and Shane who are on their adventure today.
3236620	3238660	Sometimes you're craving trashy diner food.
3238660	3240860	Waffle House is not trashy food.
3240860	3241860	It's delicious.
3241860	3242860	It's hangover food.
3242860	3243860	It is not.
3243860	3244860	I don't know.
3244860	3245860	I want unlimited waffle right now.
3245860	3249500	But you always have to order them well done because they do make their waffles a little
3249500	3250500	soggy.
3250500	3251500	All right.
3251500	3255060	Uh, and that's the 100 Matt and Chad says, wake me when a sleep away camp game comes
3255060	3256060	out.
3256060	3257060	Seriously.
3257060	3260420	Like if they had a place that would offer, you know how like I have offers like unlimited
3260420	3261420	pancakes.
3261420	3262420	I want unlimited waffles.
3262420	3265140	We're going to get unlimited waffles.
3265140	3269100	I how was I hob now?
3269100	3271460	No, it's, it's, I hob.
3271460	3273700	No one goes to your stupid restaurant for burgers.
3273700	3275620	Your burgers tastes like shit.
3275620	3276860	No one ever goes there.
3276860	3279500	Isn't that whole thing just a marketing stunt to get people to talk about it?
3279500	3281560	Like they're not actually changing their name.
3281560	3284940	I understand that, but like, I think it was a whole stunt to bring out the sassiness of
3284940	3285940	Wendy's.
3285940	3288460	But it's like, it's like, Hey, we make pancakes.
3288460	3290540	We make some fucking bomb ass pancakes.
3290540	3294340	Let's focus on these shitty ass fucking hamburgers that we make.
3294340	3296940	Why would you do that?
3296940	3300100	Why did you focus on the breakfast food?
3300100	3301100	It's good.
3301100	3303460	Your hamburgers not so much.
3303460	3310580	Because the problem is most of the I hops in America die between the hours of 1 PM and
3310580	3316260	midnight because, well, I mean, once the bars are let out, then they start filling up again.
3316260	3317340	Cause people are like, Oh, I'm drunk.
3317340	3318340	I want pancakes.
3318340	3322420	If I'm going during dinner time, I'm getting fucking pancakes because it's an I hop.
3322420	3323980	I'm not going there for fucking hamburgers.
3323980	3328740	If I want a hammer, I'll go to a million other places that are better than them, including
3328740	3330140	McDonald's and McDonald's.
3330140	3332460	Isn't even the food.
3332460	3334740	Speaking of sometimes you crave trash.
3334740	3338220	I never, I, do you know what they put in chicken nuggets?
3338220	3339220	Trash.
3339220	3341420	They're so fucking delicious.
3341420	3344760	I know, but it is just as I thought trash.
3344760	3349620	Their hamburgers though are not so great, but they are better than the I hops hamburgers.
3349620	3354460	Hey, when you're dead broke, you know, dollar hamburger works.
3354460	3358820	Tiger claw on chat says, do you know anyone that eats pancakes for lunch or dinner?
3358820	3361660	Um, yeah, I'm raising my hand.
3362260	3363260	I'm raising them both.
3363260	3365340	Breakfast for dinner is bomb.
3365340	3366340	Like yeah, it is.
3366340	3370420	I mean, you know what, O L R official challenge.
3370420	3374660	I want everyone, including the hosts, I want everyone this week, once this week to have
3374660	3378460	breakfast for dinner and send us your snaps at O L R over on Twitter.
3378460	3380140	I do this shit without a challenge.
3380140	3382620	I make, I make scram.
3382620	3384500	I make omurice at night.
3384500	3386200	You know what omurice is, right?
3386200	3387500	It's the omelet over rice.
3387500	3390780	I don't make it with ketchup cause ketchup is disgusting.
3390780	3392860	But I make omurice like regularly.
3392860	3394300	You don't, you don't have to go to I hop.
3394300	3395520	This is not a commercial for I hop.
3395520	3397500	You can, you can make your own damn pancakes.
3397500	3401580	Get out the bisque quick and make your own damn pancakes and fucking bisque quick.
3401580	3408020	I have the Birch benders pancake mix, which is delicious and craisins because it goes
3408020	3410720	amazing in their pancakes and chocolate chips.
3410720	3413300	And if you want to waffle, have a waffle.
3413300	3414300	Make that waffle bitch.
3414300	3417060	We got rid of our waffle irons.
3417060	3418060	I need a waffle iron.
3418060	3419060	Oh my God.
3419060	3422140	Why would you get rid of waffle irons and not give it to me?
3422140	3423300	My wife didn't like them.
3423300	3425180	Do you want to borrow our Hello Kitty waffle maker?
3425180	3426180	No, it's, it's cool.
3426180	3428260	I don't need the waffles like that.
3428260	3433260	I mean, I might be able to make it work if I put it in cause you know I have a Hello
3433260	3434260	Kitty.
3434260	3435940	I have like one of those, like it's not a George form.
3435940	3436940	It's a panini press.
3436940	3441420	Maybe if I put enough batter in there, that might make a weird looking like crinkle cup
3441420	3442420	waffle or something.
3442420	3447320	Well, actually the Foreman grills have a waffle tray.
3447320	3448820	That's how Alan makes waffles.
3449580	3450580	The nicer ones.
3450580	3451580	Yeah.
3451580	3452580	Yeah.
3452580	3453580	Oh, well we have a nice Foreman grills.
3453580	3454580	Rob, can I borrow your waffle maker?
3454580	3455580	Yeah.
3455580	3457300	Cause I think my pancake batter works for waffles.
3457300	3458300	Oh yeah.
3458300	3459300	Work.
3459300	3460300	Cool.
3460300	3461300	All right.
3461300	3462820	And my work, to be honest though, my work on our cafe, we have self-serve waffles.
3462820	3466180	I wonder if I can make like, put my protein powder in it, make protein waffles.
3466180	3469620	Speaking of breakfast, let's talk about eggs, dark Sakura.
3469620	3470620	Eggman.
3470620	3473780	Eggs, eggs, it's the Eggman.
3473780	3475100	I love my eggs.
3475100	3477700	I love the Eggman.
3477700	3481340	The sad thing is there's probably like two OLR listeners that will understand that reference
3481340	3483220	whatsoever.
3483220	3484220	You know, I know that reference.
3484220	3486220	I've never seen the movie all the way through.
3486220	3490740	It's a Pink Flamingos reference for those who don't know, which I just, I feel the need.
3490740	3491740	Isn't it Edith?
3491740	3495380	Yeah, it's Edith Massey's character that she's like this old lady that sits in a crib the
3495380	3496380	whole movie.
3496380	3497380	And she loves eggs.
3497380	3498380	Yeah.
3498380	3499380	She loves the Eggman.
3499380	3500380	She gets excited when she visits.
3500380	3501780	See, you guys just don't understand.
3501780	3502780	You don't understand.
3502780	3503780	You do need the watch.
3503780	3506460	So seriously though, if you, they did this wonderful thing.
3506460	3510460	I watch a lot of this channel, Red Letter Media.
3510460	3517280	They did a retrospective on Pink Flamingos and they really do go break down all the details
3517280	3518280	of the movie.
3518280	3519280	So you got to totally watch it because it's awesome.
3519280	3521780	So it's like Game Theory, but for Pink Flamingos.
3521780	3526060	More like Gaming Historian than like for Pink Flamingos.
3526060	3529540	But they're filmmakers, so they go into like different techniques and they even go like,
3529540	3530540	what techniques?
3530540	3533180	Well, they talk about like how they feel different.
3533180	3534180	What techniques?
3534900	3535900	I don't know.
3535900	3539900	John Waters movies do have some very interesting film techniques, especially for the lower
3539900	3540900	budget stuff.
3540900	3544900	Cause you have to, when you have no budget like that, but then again, you want to see
3544900	3548260	some interesting cinematography, fucking watch Cry Baby.
3548260	3551220	MXC in chat says, Edith Massey for life.
3551220	3553100	I love her in Desperate Living.
3553100	3554100	Okay.
3554100	3557920	You got points for me for referencing Desperate Living because I mean, you have a hard enough
3557920	3562060	time finding people who've actually seen Pink Flamingos, then try to see who's seen Desperate
3562060	3565940	Living because that was like the one John Waters movie that Divine wasn't in.
3565940	3569180	And so it's like even less people have seen that somehow, but that movie is incredible.
3569180	3570180	Anyway.
3570180	3571180	I fucking love Divine.
3571180	3572180	Anyway.
3572180	3573180	Sorry.
3573180	3574180	Eggs.
3574180	3575180	Okay.
3575180	3577580	So, and I'm sure everyone knows this cause I've seen it all the fuck over Facebook, but
3577580	3579620	I figured it had to be mentioned.
3579620	3588660	Jim Carrey has been in negotiations with Paramount to play Eggman as in Dr Robotnik from Sonic
3588660	3589740	the Hedgehog.
3589740	3594700	And yes, the Sonic the Hedgehog movie is going to be a combination of live action CG.
3594700	3598500	It sounds like a fucking train wreck, but we'll see.
3598500	3606300	It has James Marsden in it and Tika Sumpter being directed by Jeff Fowler.
3606300	3607460	We'll fucking see.
3607460	3611220	I mean, I guess he could play a pretty good Eggman.
3611220	3616020	I kind of see him being able to just given the range of comedic roles that he's played
3616020	3620260	and he would definitely play a funny kind of evil.
3620260	3628780	So it makes sense to me, but at the same time, I'm just still kind of like, I'm down.
3628780	3632340	I'm down for any train wreck starring Jim Carrey.
3632340	3633340	You're a big Jim Carrey fan.
3633340	3634420	I am a big Jim Carrey fan.
3634420	3635560	I'll watch anything that he's in.
3635560	3637540	That's where Loki comes from.
3637540	3641900	Sometimes people think it's the Marvel character, but you actually got your name for the mask.
3641900	3642900	Yeah.
3642900	3644900	So it's kind of funny.
3645860	3653380	I was thinking Norse God, you know, before not referencing Marvel, but nope, Jim Carrey.
3653380	3654380	Anyway.
3654380	3656260	No, I'll check it out.
3656260	3657260	Why not?
3657260	3661020	I I'm with some of the chatters that are like, let's see a trailer.
3661020	3664820	Let's let's let's see some footage before we come to a conclusion on that.
3664820	3665820	Yeah.
3665820	3667300	I don't know how I feel.
3667300	3671820	I want to know where they're going to get the Mario and Luigi voices from for the Mario
3671820	3676700	Brothers movie that they're doing over on the others that the people that did Despicable
3676700	3679180	Me are doing that that Mario movie, right?
3679180	3683020	Because that's why we're getting Mario Land at Universal Studios are going to do a movie
3683020	3684020	as well.
3684020	3685020	So I'm kind of curious.
3685020	3686020	We'll see.
3686020	3687020	We'll see.
3687020	3690060	Actually, speaking of Mario movies, have you ever seen the anime that came out in the 80s
3690060	3692540	where Luigi has like the blue and yellow outfit?
3692540	3693540	I don't think I have.
3693540	3696300	The whole fucking thing is on YouTube and it's bad.
3696300	3698380	It is not good, but it's hilarious.
3698380	3700860	Yeah, I'm good with hilariously bad.
3700900	3701900	All right.
3701900	3705660	Just a few more stories before we get into the hilariously awesome classic peripheral
3705660	3706660	of the month.
3706660	3707660	Loki.
3707660	3708660	Yes.
3708660	3712820	So my kids are bugging me again today when we went to the GameStop to look at what we
3712820	3717100	just killed time before we went grocery shopping, but they wanted to buy Labo stuff.
3717100	3720300	And I said, no, because it's 80 dollars and fuck that shit.
3720300	3721620	And they said and they're like, why?
3721620	3725340	I'm like, well, you're going to break it and it's going to be all over the house and that's
3725340	3726660	why you can't have it.
3726660	3728660	But this is something interesting, though.
3728660	3734660	So if you like arcade games, you can get your own arcade cabinet that's cardboard for the
3734660	3735660	Nintendo Switch.
3735660	3737300	It's only 20 bucks.
3737300	3741640	It's coming out November 27th, coming out from a Nyko.
3741640	3744940	And it's this cute little cabinet that you can put your joy cons in.
3744940	3752260	They even have little like joystick add ons for your analog sticks.
3752260	3755740	And yeah, it looks like you can customize it.
3755740	3757580	They have sticker sheets with pixels on them.
3757780	3763780	They can make pixel art. It's 20 dollars way better than 80 dollars.
3763780	3765260	So that's good.
3765260	3768620	I like that they're kind of branching out and doing more stuff with Labo.
3768620	3772140	Yeah, definitely. Well, I mean, yeah, absolutely.
3772140	3773640	So and this is kind of neat, too.
3773640	3776300	Now, this is something else for like arcade fans, too.
3776300	3781580	You may remember that they're getting a lot of different games that have vertical screen
3781580	3787560	support. So like Ikaruga, for example, the arcade archives Donkey Kong.
3787560	3792360	Was another thing. So now there's this Kickstarter for an accessory for the switch called the
3792360	3799960	Flip Grip, and the Flip Grip allows you to actually put the screen in a vertical orientation
3799960	3802920	and be able to snap the joy cons in there as well.
3802920	3807840	So you can play vertical games without having to balance the screen really funky in order
3807840	3809640	to actually make that happen.
3809640	3811640	So that's pretty cool.
3812640	3818000	Basically, it says right now the let's see what they've got left on it.
3818000	3820720	So they had quite a bit to go in the campaign.
3821920	3826760	And I think I think you didn't have the pledge too much to actually get one of these.
3826760	3831120	So there's still no, actually, they've hit their goal.
3831120	3832800	So they had seven days to go right now.
3832800	3836920	There are one hundred and nine thousand of forty two thousand dollars, so they've made it
3836920	3840680	there. If you want one of these flip grips, you can pay twelve bucks.
3841040	3846920	And they're estimated they're going to deliver those on sometime in 2018.
3846920	3850600	Looks like November. So neat.
3851360	3856280	All right, well, if all that expansion in the Labo universe and associated universe wasn't
3856280	3857480	enough, guess what?
3857480	3862320	Now, Nintendo Labo products can be used with actual switch games.
3862320	3867760	Yeah, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was patched this week to be compatible with Nintendo Labo.
3867800	3874080	So you can actually use the little like motorcycle type of little thing that you can make
3874080	3875480	out of the Labo little motorcycle head.
3875680	3880000	You can now use that as like an official controller type in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
3880400	3884560	So because Mario Kart also lets you do motorcycles, some people forget it's not just
3884560	3886360	karts, but you can do motorcycles in that game.
3886360	3888080	So it's it's pretty legit.
3888320	3892720	So, yeah, motion controls, cardboard button presses, all of that will work.
3892720	3893920	So that's kind of fun.
3894480	3897920	So you can do that. And Nintendo says it's not going to stop there.
3899000	3900720	Nintendo has said there will be more.
3900920	3904720	It is the first game outside of Nintendo Labo to receive Toy-Con support.
3905120	3906280	Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is.
3906440	3910200	More titles will be compatible with Nintendo Labo in the future.
3910640	3911640	Please look forward to it.
3912920	3914880	Neat. Yeah, kind of neat.
3914880	3918640	I mean, I don't want to fill my house up with all this fucking cardboard, but I like that
3918640	3920040	there's, you know, options.
3920040	3923080	And who knows, maybe something will be really compelling where I've got to try it.
3923920	3929000	I'm wondering if it will be possible to laminate all that cardboard or to seal it with
3929000	3930040	like some sort of resin.
3930560	3933120	Maybe that would give it some sort of permanence.
3933560	3938840	How about a music game that actually uses that piano keyboard mania on the switch?
3938920	3942640	There was someone that was actually an indie game that was doing that.
3942640	3944880	Oh, cool. So I don't know.
3945120	3946920	That would be awesome. I would love that.
3947520	3948720	So. All right.
3948720	3951600	And JD in chat says, I wish I could buy the piano separately.
3951960	3954920	You know, if they start releasing stuff like that, maybe you will be able to maybe you'll be
3954920	3956400	able to buy the motorcycle stuff separately.
3956400	3958360	I mean, this is where Labo's at now.
3958560	3959880	Like half the price.
3959880	3962040	I mean, it just honestly is really expensive.
3962160	3965320	I'm kind of surprised Nintendo isn't putting out a little more for the holidays.
3965320	3966360	Fucking cardboard.
3966360	3968760	Like I get the game took some development and everything.
3968760	3970320	But dude, come on.
3970320	3971680	It's fucking cardboard.
3971680	3975680	Now, here we are back to the debate from several weeks and actually to to your point.
3976040	3980320	No, no. To the point, though, if you are looking for just the piano or something like that
3980320	3984400	and you can find a used copy of the game, you could do that, because remember, they do
3984400	3986520	sell each of the pieces separately.
3986520	3987880	You can buy the replacement parts.
3988800	3990400	I just don't know if you can find it.
3990400	3992360	Use. All right.
3993120	3997400	Well, let's move on and talk about let's talk about an old school peripheral.
3997560	4001280	You know, back when everything back when your peripherals were not made out of cardboard,
4002720	4004000	they were made out of other stuff.
4004160	4005880	It's the classic game of the week.
4005880	4009560	And every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,
4009680	4015840	hey, you little brats, you should be checking this out or you can just go kick rocks.
4016440	4020800	Anyway, once a month, Dark Sakura does the classic peripheral of the month.
4021560	4025960	Since we weren't here last week, which would have been the end of June, Dark Sakura's behind
4025960	4029680	on the peripherals. So tonight is actually June's peripheral.
4029960	4034360	Yes, I know it's July 1st, but we're just going to ask you to deal with it.
4035480	4039520	So Dark Sakura, what is the classic peripheral of the month?
4039960	4043920	I chose the Rez trans vibrator.
4045960	4047200	Which great pick.
4048320	4056680	And contrary to popular parody, the trans vibrator was really not intended to be a sex
4056680	4058560	toy. Sorry, kids.
4059160	4063880	Even though Screw Attack ranked it as the number one best gaming peripheral because of
4063880	4066120	that reason. There was a whole article about it.
4066120	4067240	It was actually pretty funny.
4068080	4074920	But anyway, one of the points for Rez was to bring about the sense of synesthesia.
4075480	4079520	And if no one if you don't know what synesthesia is, it actually is something that
4079520	4083760	people like me who have autism or are autistic experience.
4083760	4085560	Not everyone does, but some of us do.
4085880	4093680	It's where one set of sensations trigger another section, almost like, for example,
4093680	4095440	people who say they can taste colors.
4096200	4105680	The theory is that their receptors in their brain that that process color goes through
4105680	4108680	their their taste sensation area as well.
4108880	4116000	Is that similar to that ASMR stuff where like you kind of hear somebody like, you know,
4116440	4121760	playing with the lady eating the pickles really slowly in the video, right in the
4121760	4124840	microphone, right? That whole like people like feel the tingles in their neck.
4124840	4125720	Is that similar to that?
4125760	4130080	It's similar, but not quite like there's a type of synesthesia.
4130080	4134520	I was actually watching a thing about it where I got this one particular person
4134520	4136560	perceives numbers as patterns.
4137040	4139360	So it actually triggers like a pattern sense.
4139360	4142280	You know how people can usually pick up patterns and things.
4142280	4148640	It triggers a pattern sense and he can do almost any math, thinkable without having
4148640	4152800	any background training or any advanced mathematics studies just by paying attention
4152800	4154200	to the patterns that form in his brain.
4154200	4157560	He can recite pie practically to infinity.
4157560	4162880	He did it to like, I want to say, a hundred points was pretty crazy.
4163680	4166040	Now, me, I do have synesthesia myself.
4166040	4173080	For me, it triggers anything that has to do with writing, reading and sound.
4173080	4177080	Anything that has to do with that all goes through my spatial awareness myself.
4177080	4181360	So I get a sense of architecture with things that I read or things that I listen to.
4181760	4186000	That's why I can't listen to some things because it will just make me feel like I'm
4186000	4187640	claustrophobic. Seriously.
4187920	4195720	So back to the trans vibrator, it is it's supposed to add to this experience of
4195720	4201160	synesthesia where you have this device that provides haptic feedback.
4201160	4206760	It's one of it's an early experiment, I'd say, into, you know, more recent technology
4206760	4207840	that uses haptic feedback.
4207840	4210600	I mean, our Apple watches Rob haptic feedback.
4211840	4220360	So at any rate, it was requested by Mizuguchi when he was designing the game and
4220360	4223760	wanting to do he was actually going through the arcade division that they wanted
4223760	4226800	cockpit chairs that would vibrate in time with the music.
4226800	4230760	And even though that didn't come about, he wanted to also use the DualShock controller
4230760	4232640	for haptic feedback in rez as well.
4232640	4233920	But it wasn't strong enough.
4234360	4242000	So he went to ASCII to design a peripheral that would function like the DualShock to
4242000	4246440	be stronger. And so in the special package version of the PlayStation 2 release of
4246440	4252080	rez included a USB haptic feedback called a device called a trans vibrator, which is
4252080	4255400	about a mouse sized peripheral that pulses in time with music.
4255760	4260920	And it was designed to either be held or put in a pocket or some people would sit on it.
4260920	4263720	You know, it had a pouch on it and the pouch could be cleaned, by the way.
4263720	4270080	So it meant to be hygienic, but you could get a closer sense of synesthesia.
4270080	4276120	It wasn't true synesthesia, but it engaged another sense to go along with the playing
4276120	4277360	and interacting with the game.
4279640	4283240	You know, and again, people will almost turn anything into something sexual because of
4283240	4287440	course they will. And so there were all the parodies around the game with that.
4287440	4288960	Like putting it in your vagina.
4289200	4290680	Yeah, but not.
4291680	4296440	At any rate, it also is compatible, though, with two other games.
4296440	4301800	One of them is with Space Channel 5 Part 2 and another with the Japanese version of
4301800	4303240	Disaster Report.
4305320	4309680	They did do some aftermarket versions.
4309880	4312040	Well, you can still buy them on aftermarket retailers.
4312040	4315400	There are some third party versions of the same thing.
4316440	4318960	They go for about 60 bucks, depending on where you find it.
4319280	4322120	They also did reverse engineer the trans vibrators.
4322120	4328960	So now they have PC drivers out for it so that you can now it was for Windows XP and
4328960	4332600	Windows 2000, but I'm sure that other people have updated those drivers for current
4332600	4339800	systems. And on top of that, a guy named Sam Hocovar, if I pronounced that right, wrote
4339800	4341080	a driver for the Linux kernel.
4341240	4346240	So now it works for Linux, which makes me think that we would be able to have there's
4346240	4351280	got to be Mac drivers for it, too, because, I mean, they're both Unix, so whatever.
4353920	4360520	And then while the trans vibrator never had any other kind of re-release and they made
4360520	4366080	a nod to it in Res HD, where you can use up to three additional controllers to add that
4366080	4368440	trans vibration function back into the game.
4370240	4373520	And I know I've been trying to avoid peripherals that are used for very specific
4373520	4377040	purposes, even though I've done the twin sticks, because other games will use the twin
4377040	4384720	sticks. But this one is so iconic because it really is because, first of all, the major
4384720	4388440	demand for it that was out at the time and even now people still go for it.
4388440	4393160	I mean, I wouldn't mind it's one thing I don't have in my collection, but there are
4393160	4398640	people, you know, who just immediately think of that need to either think of the screw
4398640	4404720	check joke, lol, haha, dildo, or, you know, think of it in terms of that collecting thing.
4404720	4407920	And there's usually general, oh, I remember that.
4407920	4409320	Not that.
4410040	4414680	Yeah, so I think it's worthy enough to be on the peripheral of the list.
4414680	4417760	And I like that they've tried to emulate it since then, like when they did Res on the
4417760	4421000	360, like the controller would kind of vibrate and you could.
4421000	4424000	Yeah, you put the extra controllers and I guess some people are talking about how
4424000	4427280	Luminous Remastered kind of does something with it on the Switch.
4427280	4430520	It really does set a precedence for that because now, I mean, well, if you think about
4430520	4435000	it too, we were already sort of having things like this in theaters, like with Captain
4435000	4436120	Neo, remember?
4436120	4436880	Oh, yeah.
4436880	4438800	You'd feel the music through your chair.
4438800	4440240	40.
4440240	4441160	Right.
4441160	4444600	And there's been a concept that's been around for a while, but we never really had anything
4444600	4448600	like that incorporated into our games pretty much until this game.
4448600	4449320	Yeah.
4449320	4450920	I mean, there were others that tried.
4450920	4455280	I mean, there was also like Sega on the Saturn.
4455280	4460280	There were some fucking weird ass games, like the ones where it was all meant to be played
4460280	4461120	without the screen.
4461120	4466000	You played it by sound or the one that like grows your flowers, grow seeds while you're
4466000	4466800	playing the damn game.
4466800	4470080	You know, weird stuff like that, that tried to engage other things.
4470080	4475680	But this was really the one that really brought that sensory feedback into, I think, modern
4475680	4477080	gaming.
4477080	4477920	All right.
4477920	4478400	There it is.
4478400	4482800	Your classic peripheral of the month, the Res trans vibrator.
4482800	4484720	The dildo.
4484720	4486760	Whatever.
4486760	4488560	We're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, guys.
4488560	4492640	We've got plenty more OLR to come, including your emails, some rapid fire news and your
4492640	4498480	calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype and more gaming news, including a
4498480	4505520	story about the latest going ons in the PUBG legal drama and some changes in the next Mega
4505520	4507120	Man collection, the Mega Man X collection.
4507120	4511280	We'll talk all about all of that when we come back after this break with more of Orange
4511280	4511920	Lounge Radio.
4511920	4512400	Stay tuned.
4519280	4525120	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live, episode number 736 in progress
4525120	4527440	for this July 1st of 2018.
4527440	4532080	And as we said at the top of the show, happy Canada Day to all of our friends up north.
4532080	4533360	Hope you guys had a good day.
4533360	4537760	And I know this week would be the 4th of July for those of us down here in the States.
4538400	4540240	A nice day off of work.
4540480	4545040	I don't know if you guys have anything fun planned or if you're going to set off fireworks
4545040	4548480	or as my mom used to call it, you might as well just set the money on fire.
4548480	4551360	It's just as effective as those safe and sane fireworks are.
4551360	4553200	Loki, you seem like a fireworks kind of guy.
4553200	4554880	Are you going to buy some fireworks and set them off?
4554880	4558160	No, I'm too smart to not buy those fireworks anymore.
4558160	4560400	Those lame safe and they're just garbage.
4560400	4562400	Yeah, it's just you might as well forget it.
4562400	4564960	Jamie, you and Dan used to buy some and set them off.
4564960	4566000	Are you doing that this year?
4566000	4568640	No, because I have to go to bed at 8 o'clock because I have to work at 5 a.m.
4568640	4569200	the next day.
4570000	4573440	Yeah, so I'm going to be using my noise canceling earplugs.
4573440	4574000	There you go.
4574000	4580000	And my light canceling eye mask and to cancel the world out.
4580000	4582000	And furthermore, with the current state of this country,
4582000	4583760	I don't think there's anything we're celebrating.
4583760	4584640	So fuck it.
4584640	4586160	Yeah, nothing to celebrate.
4586160	4588960	We have now completely turned away from what this country was founded to be.
4588960	4589520	So fuck them.
4590160	4593200	We should celebrate everybody who registers to vote.
4593200	4594880	That's what we should be celebrating.
4594880	4601840	So, yes, if you live in the United States and you also are completely disgusted with
4601840	4604960	what's going on, don't just sit on your ass and fucking complain about it.
4604960	4606640	Register the fuck to vote.
4607440	4613920	And if you have registered to vote, I would like to see you go in and actually vote besides that,
4613920	4614560	too.
4614560	4620560	But go on, go on, go on Twitter and just post.
4620560	4621520	OLR says vote.
4623280	4623760	All right.
4623760	4624480	Make a tag of it.
4624480	4625360	OLR says vote.
4626160	4626480	All right.
4626480	4627520	I'll be looking for you.
4627520	4628480	OLR says...
4628480	4634000	I might even send you a Pride edition Cards Against Humanity glitter pack.
4634000	4634480	Oh, God.
4634480	4635360	Did you get the ones with glitter in it?
4635360	4636560	I bought five of them.
4636560	4637440	I love it.
4637440	4637680	All right.
4637680	4638400	Let's get into it.
4638400	4640560	OLR says it's time for rapid fire news.
4640560	4643040	Or, oh, as Bobby Blackwolf says in Chad and Old Slogan,
4643040	4645200	vote or P Diddy will kill you.
4645200	4647680	Vote or D Se will kill you.
4647680	4653600	Anyway, I actually realized Dark Sakura has the same initials as a 3DS.
4653600	4657760	Anyway, so up to your interpretation, if a Nintendo system will kill you or if Dark Sakura
4657760	4658320	will.
4658320	4660720	Anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news.
4660720	4661520	I'm sneakier.
4661520	4664640	Loki, it's that time of the year.
4664640	4669440	It's the beginning of a new month, which means there's more new free games you get for paying
4669440	4670560	for online.
4670640	4678080	So starting with PlayStation Plus, in July, we're getting Heavy Rain and Absolver on
4678080	4679280	PlayStation 4.
4679280	4685200	PlayStation 3 is getting Raymond 3 HD and Deception 4, the Nightmare Princess.
4685200	4690160	And on the Vita, Space Overlords and Zero Escape, Zero Time Dilemma.
4691200	4692320	So that's pretty awesome.
4692320	4694720	I don't know if there's any other cross play.
4695600	4696560	Don't see any.
4696560	4698720	So we'll have to take it from there.
4699600	4707440	And then, of course, on the Microsoft side of things, for the Xbox One, for the whole
4707440	4710960	month of July, you'll be getting Assault Android Cactus for free.
4710960	4715440	And then from the second half or from the halfway point in July through the halfway
4715440	4719120	point in August, Death Squared will be free.
4719120	4725520	And then as part of the Xbox 360 and also compatible with Xbox One, Virtua Fighter 5,
4725520	4730240	the final showdown is going to be coming July 1st through the 15th and Tom Clancy's
4730240	4734720	Splinter Cell Conviction for the second half of July.
4736560	4737120	All right.
4737120	4744480	And then, in case you're living under a rock, there is a new Overwatch character and it
4744480	4749680	is a hamster in a giant ball that's a death machine.
4749680	4756800	So Hammond or Wrecking Ball, I guess, is going to be the character's name, is the new
4756800	4758800	tank character in the game.
4758800	4760240	And he shoots stuff.
4760240	4762640	He rolls around in a ball, has a grappling hook.
4762640	4764640	It's all the things that you want in a robot hamster.
4765360	4765860	Ball.
4766720	4767600	And I'm down.
4767600	4768480	It looks awesome.
4768480	4773440	I fucking love Hammond or as they call it, Wrecking Balls, the actual game by Hammond.
4773440	4774640	The little cam.
4774640	4775440	Little ham.
4775440	4776080	Hamtaro.
4776080	4776720	I love it.
4776720	4778320	So, yeah, super cute.
4778320	4782240	I love what people are doing on Twitch, too, with like the races and things like that.
4782240	4785040	Like they're racing the little balls on the map.
4785040	4785920	It's adorable.
4785920	4788800	I've saw some where there's people just spinning around stuff.
4788800	4789760	Why wouldn't you?
4789760	4790260	Yeah.
4791120	4798000	So I haven't played the public test realm yet for this new character, but yeah, it's
4798000	4799600	going to be interesting.
4799600	4800320	I can't wait to try it.
4800320	4805520	Did you see the Overwatch cartoon that someone made where the cat has a mecha?
4805520	4806020	No.
4806640	4807520	It was pretty funny.
4808000	4809040	I found it on Facebook.
4809040	4812640	There was, you know, I remember Blizzard from one of their panels from an old Blizzcon or
4812640	4816320	something showed all these Overwatch characters that didn't make the cut because they brainstormed
4816320	4819280	a ton because there was one based off of that one.
4819280	4820560	I don't remember the name of the movie.
4820560	4824240	It's one of those kung fu movies and it has the older lady with the curlers in her hair.
4824240	4825280	Oh, Kung Fu Hustle.
4825280	4825520	Yeah.
4825520	4826240	Was that it?
4826240	4828800	And so, um, like she, like they had a character.
4828800	4833760	It was basically her that they cut, unfortunately, but they also had jetpack cat.
4833760	4834400	That's awesome.
4834400	4836640	So it's like, okay, if fucking.
4836640	4842240	I say we need to go full on, you know, crazy.
4842240	4846880	Just all of this shit that you'd said, nah, nah, it's, it's too crazy.
4846880	4848080	No, bring it all back.
4848080	4848480	That's right.
4848480	4850640	We need to make this president cat level.
4852320	4853120	That's right.
4853120	4855120	Canvassing president jet pack cat.
4856960	4857200	All right.
4857200	4861600	If somebody at Blizzard really loves me, they'll make that president jet pack cat or he's got
4861600	4862720	to be the president or something.
4862720	4864560	Anyway, uh, let's move on.
4864560	4868800	So, uh, one of the reasons I was out last week is again, I was in Chicago and I was
4868800	4872160	going to pride in Chicago, just like dark soccer was at San Francisco pride.
4872160	4872880	I marched in pride.
4872880	4873200	Yes.
4873200	4873840	It was amazing.
4873840	4878160	Well, sadly, the pride event we weren't at was Seattle, but to be fair, there were lots
4878160	4882000	of pride events all around the country last week and, um, throughout the month of June
4882000	4884880	and some have them a different time of the year, just depending on what's going on in
4884880	4885680	your town.
4885680	4889600	But the reason why I bring it up and yes, it is video game related because at the Seattle
4889600	4894880	pride parade, Nintendo actually marched in the parade as did Niantic.
4895440	4896800	Nintendo actually had these stickers.
4896800	4898480	They were given away that said, play it proud.
4898480	4900000	And they had little rainbows on them.
4900000	4903920	Uh, the, the employees are giving out the sticker and I think that's a really cool.
4903920	4907920	Um, so we actually saw some tweets out there from some of the employees in Nintendo, including
4907920	4909760	Jose Otero and Bill Trennan.
4909760	4911360	So, um, yeah, that's really cool.
4911360	4914240	I wish I could have seen that, but I bet some of you in Seattle did.
4914240	4918960	And, uh, you know, I know that the whole like corporations with rainbow logos and kind of
4918960	4920400	jumping in on pride month.
4920400	4923520	I know it's a little bit controversial because some people kind of feel like, Oh, they just
4923520	4925680	show up for pride month and try to get the gay dollars.
4925680	4926320	Then they run away.
4926320	4926800	But you know what?
4927440	4930880	I remember a time when nobody wanted to touch these issues.
4930880	4936800	So I mean, it kind of warms my heart in many ways to see like Nintendo with rainbow flags
4936800	4938480	and employees like marching in the parade.
4938480	4939280	Cause that's awesome.
4939280	4944880	Cause you know, I remember a time in my life when I turned to video games because I kind
4944880	4946400	of didn't think there was anything else.
4946480	4950000	So, you know, let's have a moment here.
4950000	4950640	All right.
4950640	4955680	Anyway, uh, moving from a serious topic like that to a less serious topic, but apparently
4955680	4957360	very serious for some people.
4957360	4961200	And that would be the exclusion of Waluigi from Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.
4963760	4966800	Or, uh, he's a, uh, a support character, I suppose.
4966800	4971440	Apparently Reggie Fils-Aime has been asked about it in an interview with Vice.
4971440	4974480	Jesus Christ, this is the level of fuckery we've gotten to.
4974480	4979520	And, uh, Reggie Fils-Aime said, clearly Nintendo does not hate Waluigi.
4982240	4983920	I look, Reggie is on record.
4983920	4986800	You guys, Nintendo does not hate Waluigi.
4986800	4987680	Stop it.
4987680	4990880	They have to like, they have to add more characters as it goes along.
4990880	4994000	I mean, this isn't the full roster that they announced, obviously.
4994000	5000000	But basically he's pushed it off on Sakurai because it's his game saying Mr.
5000000	5004080	Sakurai will be aware of the groundswell of support that appeared for Waluigi.
5004080	5006640	And in the end, it's his decision to make.
5006640	5008160	They will bring him in there.
5008160	5010640	He'll be a character by the time the game comes out.
5010640	5011360	Or DLC.
5012880	5014000	He'll be in the roster.
5014000	5014160	Right.
5014160	5015840	But he's, he's an assist trophy right now.
5015840	5018480	They're going to have to take out that assist trophy because you don't have
5018480	5020320	characters that are also assist trophies.
5020320	5022080	I'm sure they can remove this trophy.
5022080	5022720	It's Waluigi.
5022720	5023360	He can do anything.
5024160	5024880	I like that.
5024880	5026000	That's a good perspective.
5026000	5030000	I also found, by the way, that everything that I thought about his name is actually
5030000	5031680	accurate, that it is the pun that I thought it was.
5032400	5035840	Because Walui would be, means bad or sick.
5036800	5039280	And so in the G part would be like for person.
5039280	5041760	So he just means his name means bad person.
5043520	5048480	Ranma in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Waluigi is trash.
5048480	5049280	Fuck him.
5049280	5050480	Go away Waluigi.
5050480	5051280	No one likes you.
5052000	5052800	Wow.
5052800	5057920	The views and opinions expressed in our chat room do not reflect those of VOG Network or
5057920	5058400	ourselves.
5058400	5059920	Here's that's, that's some powerful words.
5060000	5062800	It's funny that he has a thing for Daisy and she's like, bitch, no.
5062800	5070480	To which, to which I say, Ranma, to which I say, wah, that stupid noise is never going
5070480	5070960	to get old.
5073120	5078400	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com
5078400	5080880	use the passphrase, butcher.
5080880	5081840	What are you drinking over there?
5081840	5082240	You're pretty satisfied.
5082240	5086560	I mixed the last of my blackberries in with that orange juice that did steal over that
5086560	5087280	coconut water.
5087280	5087680	Yeah.
5087680	5091440	Made myself my own little delicious cocktail and I get to eat blackberries when I'm done.
5092080	5093920	She just mixed a little bit of everything.
5093920	5095360	Actually, it's kind of a purple drink.
5095360	5096960	I think I would call that a Waluigi.
5096960	5097920	I'll take a picture of it.
5097920	5100560	You all know because it's actually delicious and doesn't make me sick.
5100560	5103520	An official Waluigi drink here at OLR.
5103520	5104240	All right.
5104240	5106720	Then you just have to add a little bit of vodka to top it off.
5106720	5106960	All right.
5106960	5110960	Well, you know, oh, by the way, I did finish another infused vodka.
5110960	5111280	I know.
5111280	5113120	I saw the pictures of rose petals, right?
5113120	5117520	I'd made rose petal vodka and I would be willing to share it with people if they're interested.
5118480	5119440	Uh, let's move on.
5119440	5122560	Dark Sakura, before you take pictures, you got to do some rapid fire news stories of
5122560	5123040	your own.
5123040	5126400	Well, I just took the picture because I can fucking multitask like a bitch.
5126400	5131120	So anyway, um, also Nintendo is doing some good things for us.
5131120	5134720	Well, they've already done it and it's probably already sold out by now, but they brought
5134720	5137600	back the NES classic edition on June 29th.
5137600	5143200	So two days ago from today, um, they've released it for $59.99.
5143200	5147440	Just like when it released in November, 2016 has all the same consoles on it.
5147440	5155920	Like, you know, Super Mario Brothers, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, um, and the SNES classic edition
5155920	5157520	is still in production.
5158080	5161680	Um, but good luck finding them.
5161680	5165200	I mean, seriously, I've, I've, I've, I've heard from some people who said that they
5165200	5169600	found them like at, you know, Walmart, which I don't support and other stores.
5169600	5171760	So you may still be lucky.
5171760	5174640	So if you want it, go and get it while you can.
5177120	5185520	And I have the final totals for Summer Games Done Quick, which I watched the shit out of.
5185520	5188800	I saw the countdown when they were trying to reach 2 million.
5188800	5189760	It was pretty epic.
5190400	5198000	Um, the total donation amount, um, was, uh, $2,128,069.
5198880	5202080	And that is over 35,000 people donating.
5202080	5205600	The average donation by people was about $60 a donation.
5208240	5211360	I donated, um, Dan and I did.
5211360	5216560	Um, and I would actually like to say that when we go up for Awesome Games Done Quick,
5217120	5221920	I was actually thinking of, of putting it out there to our listeners of starting like
5221920	5227040	a small fund so that we could do a mass donation in the name of Orange Lounge Radio.
5228320	5231520	Oh, donate so we can donate, donate so we can donate big.
5232080	5232800	Exactly.
5232800	5234240	You know, interesting.
5234240	5236720	And I would encourage everyone to do, you know, the little bit here and there.
5236720	5242080	But I think that if we start accumulating the donations, we can make out that one big
5242080	5247280	massive check so that we can ensure that the animals will be killed on the snow.
5247280	5253200	I save the animals so we can see that little pixel fly off the planet.
5253200	5254960	The animals will be killed.
5254960	5256480	No, save the animals.
5256480	5257760	Save the frames.
5257760	5258640	Save the animals.
5260080	5261280	You're a terrible human being.
5261280	5261520	All right.
5261520	5261760	Yeah.
5262320	5266160	JD says, where would you accept donations to that wouldn't take a percentage fee?
5266160	5266720	My hand.
5268400	5269520	No, give me, give me money.
5269520	5270400	I'll work on it.
5270400	5271520	Yeah, we'll see.
5271520	5271760	Okay.
5271760	5272880	Dark soccer is going to work on it.
5274240	5274740	All right.
5275440	5279200	Meanwhile, let's travel the world and check out some release dates.
5279200	5279700	Loki.
5280320	5281200	There's not much.
5281200	5286400	I mean, honestly, July is usually a very dead month when it comes to game releases.
5286400	5287600	So we've got two.
5287600	5290800	We've got run bow coming out on Nintendo switch.
5290800	5298480	And then your pun title of the week, red faction gorilla, the remarse stirred edition.
5300160	5301040	That's on PC.
5305200	5305700	That's it.
5306800	5307300	All right.
5307840	5310240	Well, let's see what the news is like in Japan.
5310240	5312400	On July the 5th on PlayStation four.
5312400	5317600	Zankai zero is out as well as a classic edition of far cry three.
5317600	5320320	And that's really it for Japan this week on the PlayStation four.
5321040	5326240	PlayStation Vita also gets that Zankai zero as well as a game called seven days.
5326240	5327840	Not to be confused with the ring.
5327840	5329200	It's actually called seven days.
5329200	5330160	Anata two.
5330160	5331120	So Guso.
5331120	5332960	Nano Kaka comes out.
5333920	5339680	I didn't realize that on the Vita in the U S did you know next week on the Vita in the U S
5340320	5342240	good old, uh, OLR favorite title.
5342240	5346000	Muv Luv is coming out in the U S we're getting our own.
5346000	5350080	It's that same company that got denied the, uh, the, uh, translation.
5352080	5354960	Anyway, plus rapture, uh, nothing on the switch this week.
5354960	5357120	It is a quiet week on the switch in Japan.
5357120	5359120	So there's your Japanese releases.
5359120	5362160	How about the UK dark soccer on the third?
5362160	5364720	And really the third is the only day with stuff coming out.
5364720	5368240	We have drastic world evolution for Xbox and PlayStation.
5368880	5373680	We had red faction gorilla remastered again, same, uh, consoles.
5373680	5377360	And also on the same consoles is Warhammer 40 K Inquisitor martyr.
5378320	5380080	That is it.
5380080	5380720	Symphony.
5382560	5384640	All right, let's get to the mailbag.
5384640	5386000	We'll have to read fast too.
5386000	5390960	Cause every week you guys send us emails and sometimes we read them.
5390960	5391760	I have hiccups.
5391760	5393120	I'm just going to turn it over to Jamie.
5393120	5394800	I hate radio guys.
5394800	5397600	Biggest nightmare is hitting me right now.
5397600	5398640	So Jamie, take it away.
5398640	5400320	Participate at orange.radio.com.
5400320	5402240	I'm going to be reading fast cause Jamie's got to go.
5402240	5403760	Cause she's got work in the morning.
5403760	5404160	Hi guys.
5404160	5405520	Just wanted to bring up a few things from last up.
5405520	5407040	So that kind of struck a nerve with me.
5407040	5408160	This kind of long email.
5408160	5408480	Sorry.
5408480	5410720	Regardless, I still have been a fan of the show for years.
5410720	5411680	I will continue to listen.
5412400	5414960	First thing I hope I didn't hear the wrong way and clarify if I am,
5414960	5417600	but dark soccer mentioned the kids included in last of us.
5417600	5419520	Part two is some sort of tokenism.
5419520	5422080	I see his growth of the character and the last of us left behind.
5422080	5425520	We saw Ellie lose her best friend who in the end realized she had feelings for
5425520	5425920	the writing.
5425920	5429520	The performances felt incredibly natural and it wasn't shoehorned in.
5429520	5432240	I feel like this writing was present in the last of us part two trailer as well
5432240	5436160	and left behind has earned the believability of her sexuality.
5436160	5438640	And her sexuality isn't pointed out in an obnoxious way throughout the
5438640	5440000	entirety of the last of us.
5440000	5443280	The question to this is what is the right way of presenting LGBT characters
5443280	5444240	in a trailer?
5444240	5448720	And is it any representation of LGBT in a big event like E3 tokenism?
5448720	5450080	First of all, I've never played last of us.
5450080	5453520	So I have any idea about the character story and kind of don't give a shit
5453520	5455360	cause I don't want to play last of us.
5456240	5458400	But to be fair, you did call it tokenism.
5458400	5461440	I said it seemed like tokenism or if I called it tokenism is more that I
5461440	5466480	thought it seemed like it cause on the surface, you know, it seems like
5466480	5470400	something that a big company is going to do is throw a bone to try to attract
5470400	5471840	a more diverse audience.
5471840	5472400	Right.
5472400	5473760	You know, here's the thing.
5473760	5475200	I wouldn't put it past Sony.
5475200	5478640	I haven't played the games either because I'm just not big on scary
5478640	5480160	zombie type games right here.
5480720	5486080	However, I was aware because we talked about it a couple or a year or two
5486080	5487760	ago when that DLC came out.
5487760	5491600	I remember the big reveal about her sexuality in the DLC.
5492480	5495600	So therefore, I know that this is something that's been and as the
5495600	5498000	emailer kind of points out, it was developed then.
5498000	5501440	And so that's why to me, I'm kind of like, okay, I mean, this isn't just
5501440	5503680	like surprise, everybody's gay.
5503680	5505440	Like this isn't like that type of thing.
5505440	5510000	So I, I think what they did was appropriate, but that's, that's a
5510000	5511040	personal perspective.
5511040	5512640	Again, I'm not a lesbian.
5512640	5513760	I'm also ace.
5513760	5517760	So I don't really see what the fuck point there is that any type of
5517760	5519920	romantic subplot is going to add to a game anyway.
5519920	5521280	It's just, I mean, okay.
5521280	5524560	I like it for Mass Effect cause for me, that's like 50% of BioWare games
5524560	5525520	is who you're going to romance.
5526400	5530720	But the same thing anyway is just, I'm, I'm, I'm actually a really a lot
5530720	5531360	more as of late.
5531360	5533600	Why does there have to be fucking romance involved in the game anyway?
5534160	5538320	Well, just to, to, to kind of put the email in perspective, I think as
5538320	5541040	part of this, cause I think this is written respectfully and you know,
5541040	5542560	they say they're a fan.
5542560	5549040	Um, what if the next, let's say the next big reveal is Mass Effect 4 and
5549040	5554320	in the Mass Effect 4 trailer, they show, uh, Shepard is back magically
5554320	5555440	somehow space magic.
5555440	5558480	Shepard is back and Shepard makes out with Kayden in the trailer.
5558480	5559920	Is that going to be tokenism?
5559920	5563920	Well, no, because you can also pick whoever you fucking romance in a
5563920	5564640	Mass Effect game.
5565520	5565840	Okay.
5565840	5566640	Fair, fair.
5566640	5567920	So there is, there is that choice involved.
5567920	5569520	And besides that, my Shepard is always female.
5569520	5571040	So I instantly thought femshep.
5571040	5571200	Okay.
5571200	5574560	So if femshep makes out with Liara in the trailer, is that tokenism?
5575200	5578160	Well, they are technically agendered.
5578160	5578560	Yeah.
5578560	5581120	How about they all have sex with everybody?
5581120	5581680	No, I'm just kidding.
5581680	5581840	Okay.
5581840	5582320	That's fine.
5582960	5583520	All right.
5583520	5586160	No, my thought is because again, I don't play that game.
5586160	5587280	I don't know that game.
5587280	5589520	I haven't really been interested in that game.
5589520	5592000	If it's something that's been in development, that's great.
5592000	5597680	I just think this, that if it's something that was expected, then that's one thing.
5597680	5599520	And I'll take it back in the case of this game.
5599520	5603120	But if they'd like say introduce new game and they have two girls kissing
5605120	5608800	that if we don't have any context around it, then it can seem very much like,
5608800	5610240	Oh, by the way, gay stuff.
5610240	5611280	Come on people.
5611280	5613600	So it's kind of like the corporate logos in rainbow.
5613600	5615920	It's not about, yeah, it's like the corporate logos in rainbow.
5615920	5617440	Put up or shut it up type of thing.
5617440	5618080	Exactly.
5618080	5618320	Yeah.
5618320	5619520	You can't have a rainbow logo.
5620960	5623920	Now that I, you know, know a little bit more about the character, then that's fine.
5624560	5625280	I'm fine with it.
5625280	5626000	I don't care.
5627120	5629040	It's clearly not tokenism in that case.
5629040	5636320	But if it was just like random trailer new game, if Anthem had two girls making out while
5637280	5641520	two boys are making out and then two completely weird tentacle aliens are making out that
5641520	5644640	are clearly of whatever the gender is in their particular species.
5644640	5645140	Yes.
5646080	5649760	That would seem a little bit, by the way, rainbow logos.
5649760	5650240	Come on.
5650240	5652000	BioWare loves you gays.
5652800	5653760	Exactly.
5653760	5654880	Yeah, I get it.
5654880	5655360	I get it.
5655360	5658320	I mean, to be fair, I get the perspective kind of you're coming from as well.
5658320	5659040	So yeah.
5659040	5659440	Okay.
5659440	5663360	Second, why is everyone comparing games to other things is kind of annoying to me.
5663360	5667680	Starlink isn't as open as No Man's Sky and has a narrative present throughout the trailers.
5667680	5669360	It has very little semblance to it.
5669360	5671600	And I don't think it's fair to compare games to others.
5672160	5676400	This affected games like Battleborn, for example, which had MOBA gameplay, unlike Overwatch.
5676960	5682480	Even then, if something is similar to another game, it can present competition and iteration,
5682480	5684720	which can improve the gaming industry.
5684720	5688880	For example, Fortnite and PUBG, which are two different games of the same genre, or
5688880	5689920	Tomb Raider and Uncharted.
5692560	5694320	People like to have, though...
5694320	5697200	I mean, and this is something that I don't know, because I'm honestly not a big fan of
5697200	5700240	comparisons along those lines.
5700880	5704800	But at the same time, people like to link it to something that's familiar to them.
5704800	5705360	Exactly.
5706160	5708160	It's how we tend to describe things.
5708160	5711280	Like, if I were to say, like, I have to do this all the time.
5711280	5712960	Like, we'll be out playing Pokemon Go.
5712960	5715600	And then I'm like, hold on, I got to switch to Ingress real fast.
5715600	5716480	What's Ingress?
5716480	5717680	How do you play Ingress?
5717680	5722080	And I have to kind of catch myself going, well, it's kind of like Pokemon Go.
5722080	5724720	Even though in the back of my head, I'm like, it's actually nothing like Pokemon Go.
5724720	5728000	But like, that's how this person is going to know it because they play Pokemon Go.
5728560	5732080	So at least they're going to understand how the real world kind of locations play into it.
5732080	5736000	So I think sometimes you kind of like have to compare to be able to explain something
5736000	5736960	to someone.
5736960	5740640	But really, the best way to know it is to try it your damn self.
5740640	5742400	Well, it's sort of like the same thing for me.
5742400	5747120	Like, if I go on Facebook, okay, and say, you know, I hate marshmallows.
5747840	5749760	And someone goes, well, I love marshmallows.
5749760	5750880	And I hate this, this and this.
5750880	5754560	I'm like, well, what the fuck do those other things have to do with the fact that marshmallows
5754560	5755440	are fucking disgusting?
5756400	5757360	Well, here's the thing.
5758080	5762400	I love marshmallows, but you have every right to hate them because I also know that you
5762400	5763280	have your thing.
5763280	5764480	I like mayonnaise.
5764480	5766080	I hate mayonnaise.
5766080	5766880	I hate ketchup.
5766880	5767600	You like it.
5767600	5769680	Do you know what the perfect solution is to this problem?
5769680	5770240	Dark Sakura?
5770240	5772000	You can have the marshmallows and I'll have the mayonnaise.
5772000	5772800	Oh, my God.
5772800	5775360	If only we knew how to solve all of our problems.
5775360	5778640	Oh, I thought it was, you know, putting mayonnaise inside of marshmallows.
5778640	5781600	No, even that.
5781600	5782800	Now, given I grew up.
5783120	5786320	And if you ever watch Emmy made in Japan, she tried this.
5786320	5788080	I grew up eating mayonnaise on pears.
5789120	5790160	It's a Southern thing.
5790720	5793120	Don't you?
5793120	5794560	I will take the marshmallows.
5794560	5797840	You may have the mayonnaise, but marshmallows are disgusting and so is ketchup.
5797840	5804640	Anyway, third, Sony have been releasing games in the spring and summer seasons rather than
5804640	5805600	the fall and winter seasons.
5805600	5810240	Lately, they're less likely to have more games this year after E3, they released God of War
5810720	5814080	in Detroit, become human this year, and we'll have Spider-Man in September.
5814080	5815200	Those are some big games.
5815200	5818960	Hopefully dreams can have a beta in winter and released in the spring.
5818960	5823040	I do agree, however, that their games are becoming similar to that uncharted slash The
5823040	5826240	Last of Us third person cinematic stealth action gameplay formula.
5826800	5830400	To be honest, I'm not that interested in their lineup either.
5830400	5834000	Death Stranding especially looks incredibly dull to me as someone who hasn't played the
5834000	5835120	Metal Gear Solid games.
5835680	5837920	Once again, I really like listening to the show every week.
5837920	5839280	I look forward to the discussion.
5839280	5840080	That's from Multi.
5840080	5844160	Thank you for a very good and well thought out and actually decently grammar email.
5844880	5848560	And I think you are right on the Sony thing about how they have a lot of these similar
5848560	5850400	types of games, but it does well for them.
5850400	5855040	I mean, look how well received Uncharted and Last of Us and those games do like people
5855040	5855920	want more of it.
5855920	5858000	So that's what Sony's delivering.
5858000	5859920	They latch on to what's going to make the money.
5859920	5861440	I do want to read one comment from our chat.
5861440	5863600	I know you're trying to run through these dark soccer, but I think this is a really
5863600	5865840	good response to the whole tokenism thing.
5865840	5872640	So JD in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com said it's hard to get actual LGBT representation
5872640	5874160	without romance.
5874160	5880160	We're more than who we love, but there's a long tradition of not showing that as a means
5880160	5880960	of erasing us.
5881520	5884640	That's a very interesting perspective and kind of right.
5884640	5892480	Like, is there a way to be lesbian, gay, without having or transgender, let's say?
5892480	5896400	Because remember in transgender is not a sexuality, though.
5896400	5896960	It's not.
5896960	5898400	But here's my point.
5898400	5903360	Because Mass Effect Andromeda caught a lot of shit because you had that character that
5903360	5904560	was dead named herself.
5904560	5905040	Exactly.
5905040	5906160	I'm transgender.
5906160	5906800	Look at me.
5906800	5910640	I'm transgender and I'm going to do all these things that a transgender person actually
5910640	5911280	would never do.
5912160	5918720	I do know I have a couple of trans friends who will just be upfront about it.
5919280	5922720	You may have known me as this, or if we were in the same circles, you might have known
5922720	5923120	this name.
5923120	5924240	That was me then.
5924240	5927840	You know, I've known people who've said that, but usually they were people that you knew
5928560	5930480	or the people that I knew.
5930480	5930720	Right.
5930720	5932400	As they were going through this transition.
5932400	5932720	Yeah.
5933600	5936160	But at the same time, yeah, you're correct.
5936160	5937680	No one's really going to dead name themselves.
5939120	5941600	Anyway, I don't want to drag it out, but I just thought that was a really good point
5941600	5942160	from JD.
5942160	5945760	But also, though, my thing, too, is, though, and I'm not referring necessarily to romance
5945760	5948480	in the case of it being a gay romance.
5948800	5949680	I have a thing.
5949680	5955920	It just seems like romance has become such an integral part to any game or movie or book.
5956720	5961200	People have to be fucking or something or falling in love.
5961200	5966960	And I'm like, can't you have a relationship in a book or movie or a game that is based
5966960	5969120	on really strong friendship?
5969120	5972560	Or how about something where the thing you learn to love is yourself?
5972560	5975680	Because if you can't love yourself, how the hell you gonna love somebody else?
5975680	5977280	Can I get an amen up in here?
5977280	5977920	Next email.
5978480	5978980	Okay.
5979840	5983040	I've been listening to the show for a while, and I was wondering who is this, Ron?
5983040	5985360	By the way, it's R-A-N-M-A, just letting you know.
5986080	5988160	This is also from another Jamie, which is great.
5988160	5989920	I don't have a nickname on here, though.
5989920	5995520	Guy that calls in when you open the Skyplines, you all seem to be friends and have some history.
5995520	5999040	I have no idea of if I even said his name correctly.
5999040	5999680	Lol.
5999680	6000880	Explain this person.
6000880	6001680	Lol.
6001680	6006560	By the way, I've listened to damn near every gaming podcast, and OLR feels like home base
6006560	6007120	for me.
6007120	6008880	I look forward to hearing you all every week.
6008880	6010400	Oh, thank you, Name Twin.
6010400	6010900	Thank you.
6011680	6014000	Ron has been our buddy for an age.
6014000	6018720	He's been there practically since the beginning, you know, through the live 365 era.
6018720	6020480	He's been with us for an age.
6020480	6021520	He's been out here.
6021520	6023040	We've gone to conventions.
6023040	6025920	He has his own show called Anime Jam Session with his buddies.
6025920	6026420	Yes.
6026960	6029520	And he's just a really awesome guy.
6029520	6030480	And on top of that,
6030480	6033200	And he needs to not pay his friends money to write emails about him.
6033200	6033920	No, I'm kidding.
6033920	6034480	I'm totally kidding.
6034480	6034960	I'm kidding.
6034960	6040960	But I've, you know, we've all we've become really just good friends anyway.
6040960	6043920	I mean, I'd consider him part of part of our family here.
6043920	6044420	Oh, for sure.
6044960	6052000	And the thing is, emailer, before we did not know Ranma before this show.
6052000	6057680	We know Ranma and many people that call in, not just Ranma, but many of the regulars.
6057680	6058800	You know, we love our regulars.
6058800	6059760	We love new people, too.
6059760	6061680	Everybody should feel free to call in and participate.
6061680	6062800	It's for everybody.
6062800	6064080	It's where every gamer has a voice.
6064720	6069600	But like, there are so many people that we have met and become friends with and do feel
6069600	6071600	like family because of this show.
6071600	6075440	And it is it is a feeling I can't really describe.
6075440	6076400	We find our tribe.
6076400	6077440	We've created this thing.
6077440	6078400	Yeah, we find our tribe.
6078400	6079200	I like that.
6079200	6079920	We sure do.
6079920	6081200	That's a good note to end that on.
6081200	6082320	You know, we have one last email.
6083280	6084320	Merry evening, peoples.
6084320	6085920	By the way, this is Redertainment.
6086640	6089280	I've noticed an odd thing in an article posted by an outlet.
6089280	6092240	Sky has stated he has reservations about Polygon.
6094480	6098000	This, hold on, let me find the article real quick.
6098000	6103040	So the article here is the seven year old Sims mobile game is being pulled from Chinese
6103040	6103600	app stores.
6106080	6109600	The headline of the story leads with the game being removed from Chinese app stores.
6109600	6114000	But the other six countries affected by this are predominantly Muslim countries.
6114000	6119920	Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar and Egypt.
6120480	6125280	The article also cites a source from a company manager from EA that the game is being removed
6125280	6126640	for regional standards.
6127520	6130560	Speculation among fans is that the content is being removed.
6132000	6132640	Wait, never mind.
6132640	6134080	I skipped to the same line again.
6134080	6138720	Speculation among fans is that the content is being removed because of regional standards
6138720	6140080	in Muslim countries.
6140080	6141600	I'd like to join that speculation.
6141600	6145920	It is my honest belief that this game was pulled from the app stores that are predominantly
6145920	6149840	Muslim countries because the game no longer meets the regional standards of those countries.
6149840	6154000	Remove the game from Chinese app stores at the same time may just be coincidence.
6154560	6158240	Anyway, the point of me sending this email, why lead with the game being removed from
6158240	6163200	Chinese app stores when the game is being removed from many countries, from many countries
6163200	6166160	app stores, most of whom are majority Muslim?
6166160	6170240	Isn't the game being removed from the app store of majority Muslim countries the lead?
6170240	6172960	Bottom line, Sky is correct to distrust articles from Polygon.
6172960	6173840	Yes, Sky is correct.
6173840	6175040	Pause to allow for gloating.
6175040	6175680	Stay black.
6175680	6176720	Redertainment.
6176720	6179120	I distrust headlines from a lot of places.
6179520	6182000	Here, you know, articles are not right.
6182000	6186320	Or, you know, most websites are not writing articles with headlines to accurately reflect
6186320	6187440	what's in the story anymore.
6188080	6190560	They're writing headlines to get you to click on on Facebook.
6191920	6193200	I mean, that's the reality.
6193200	6196640	So, you know, US versus China is very in right now.
6196640	6200640	Thanks to all this talk about terror tariffs and all this stuff you see on the national
6200640	6200880	news.
6200880	6205120	I'm not going to get into politics, but that's the reality is US versus China is super in
6205120	6205520	right now.
6206240	6210000	So, I think that's what you're seeing with some of that, you know.
6210640	6216880	To be fair, as much as I don't want to give this particular website credit, I will, because
6216880	6217840	I'm a fair person.
6218640	6224800	To be fair, the population of China is much bigger than any other country in the world.
6224800	6229040	So, it is fair to kind of lead off with China because it is the most populated.
6229040	6231600	But I think an accurate headline would have been game is removed.
6231600	6232640	Your larger world power.
6233520	6236320	Game was removed from eight countries or whatever the total number was.
6236320	6239280	I'm sorry, I didn't catch the whole number, but may have been a more accurate reflection
6239280	6240480	of what's going on.
6240480	6248400	But anyway, Bobby Blackwell in chat says, also realized that on most web websites, the author
6248400	6251600	of the article does not write the headline.
6251600	6254400	The editor does after reading the article.
6254400	6255360	That's a very good point.
6256240	6261360	JD also brings up, it might also be that China has its own internet and therefore its own
6261360	6262080	app store.
6262080	6263520	So, some thoughts from our chatters.
6264160	6265440	Any other emails or was that it?
6266160	6266800	That was it.
6266800	6270640	And on that note, I will bid everyone a fond adieu for the evening.
6270640	6271600	Well, thanks for being here.
6271600	6274160	As always, Dark Sakura, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?
6274960	6276640	I'm going to fucking eat another one of these chocolates.
6276640	6278960	I don't care how sick it makes me because it's amazing.
6278960	6280400	They are pretty fucking good, aren't they?
6280400	6281360	Oh my God, yes.
6281360	6282240	Enjoy.
6282240	6283680	All right, there you go.
6283680	6290000	So, if you want to send us an email for a future week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
6290640	6293600	We're going to get into some more news and I'm going to apologize because I can't seem
6293600	6295760	to get rid of these hiccups, but I'm going to do my best.
6295760	6298880	So, let's go to Loki to get some gaming news.
6299600	6301840	All right, so this is unfortunate.
6302560	6308080	There is a whole issue with companies suing other companies for copying things.
6308080	6314160	So, for example, you know, you had the folks at Bluehole that were suing Epic Games for
6316160	6317200	copying.
6317200	6317760	No, I don't know.
6317760	6318560	Don't they use bleach?
6319200	6319920	They probably don't.
6319920	6320720	Weren't you leaving?
6321920	6323920	You're the one who brought it back stuff earlier, I'm just saying.
6325440	6330960	So, unfortunately, you know, they were accused of copying something and we'll get to that
6330960	6335200	in a little bit, but this is another game that actually has been on my radar because
6335200	6339280	I have it in my, I want list for Steam.
6339280	6340960	It's a game called Donut Country.
6340960	6345840	It's a sort of, I guess, sort of like a reverse katamari game.
6345840	6351520	So, basically, you have a hole that you control that you suck up things in and as, you know,
6351520	6356080	things fall into the hole, the hole gets bigger and you can drop more things into the hole.
6356720	6362640	So, this game's been in development for a while and because of that and with the new
6362640	6367360	information that's been out there, somebody has stolen that idea and put out a game called
6367360	6370560	Hole.io because that's so fucking clever.
6370560	6371440	Holy moly.
6371440	6377680	It's on the iOS store and, you know, I went into this endeavor to make something meaningful
6377680	6381280	to people and spent a long time trying to figure out what it looks like.
6381280	6384880	I had to make all the little details myself.
6384880	6385920	I wanted it to matter.
6387360	6390320	They just took the elevator pitch, the unique selling point.
6391120	6396320	It is the message that can, it's the message that content doesn't matter.
6396320	6399680	The message is if you can find the content for free, take it.
6399840	6407200	So, that's kind of unfortunate that someone kind of stole the concept of the game, but
6407200	6409280	I'm looking for the actual game coming out.
6409280	6413520	And I guess this is why companies don't announce stuff way in advance anymore because people
6413520	6415040	will just flat out fucking steal it.
6415920	6416420	Yeah.
6417120	6419920	So, I mean, there's a lot of games that are kind of like that.
6419920	6422640	So, I don't know.
6422640	6427440	And apparently, I think this company has been doing this for a while.
6427920	6432400	There's other companies, you know, they've had that ridiculous fish scene had an issue.
6434000	6437600	There was a different publisher that released a game called Ninja Fishing that was very
6437600	6438100	similar.
6440080	6444320	There was, I guess, another, I don't know.
6445760	6448320	It just, it's unfortunate.
6448320	6452880	But, you know, honestly, though, even though they stole the premise of the game, it's going
6452880	6454160	to come out to the polish.
6454960	6460880	And I think that this whole this game is going to be much more polished when it comes out.
6460880	6465600	This other like whole IO thing was just made using like Unity assets from the store, like
6465600	6466960	$20 Unity assets, right?
6466960	6468240	Yeah, it looks really cheap.
6468240	6468740	Silly.
6469200	6473200	And I mean, that's you see that a lot of times he's really fast, like kind of make a quick
6473200	6473920	buck game.
6473920	6475840	So, whatever.
6475840	6480480	I mean, it does suck, but true quality wins out in the end, usually.
6480480	6483280	All right.
6483280	6488000	So, the latest and greatest of what's going on in EA Star Wars drama.
6488000	6492800	So, you might remember in October, EA shut down Visceral Games that was working on a
6492800	6494400	secret Star Wars project.
6494400	6499760	And Amy Henning, who is famous for Uncharted, kind of going back to that email earlier,
6499760	6500800	was a big part of this.
6501440	6505280	But Amy Henning left the company and there was really no talk about what happened to
6505280	6507120	the game, what happened to anything with this.
6507120	6513040	Well, at a conference called Game Lab in Barcelona this past week, Amy Henning talked to Eurogamer
6513040	6519040	about how she actually left EA in January of this year and was starting up her own new
6519040	6523280	independent studio, but hadn't had a chance to announce what's going on or talk about
6523280	6523760	what it is.
6524640	6529440	Apparently, she was asked about, is she still the creative director of a Star Wars project?
6529440	6531440	The reply was, I'm not.
6531440	6534000	I haven't worked at EA since January, technically legally.
6534560	6535360	This is the problem.
6535360	6538960	It was hard enough for them, but people were immediately asking them, is Amy working with
6538960	6539520	you?
6539520	6544000	And the answer was, well, we're in negotiations, you know, because that's the way these things
6544000	6544480	go.
6544480	6546880	I haven't been in, but look, I get along with all those people.
6546880	6550960	I consider even the guys on the executive team friends, but it made it awkward because
6550960	6555280	it was like, I never got the chance to announce that I'm not at EA, so I just need to pull
6555280	6558400	off that bandaid at some point, but also had nothing to announce.
6558400	6562480	It makes it sound like I just went home, but I'm doing all this stuff, working on all kinds
6562480	6562960	of things.
6563760	6566720	And thanks to that last story, you know why she isn't talking about them.
6566720	6570960	Yes, because somebody would probably just steal them, but she's working independently
6570960	6572000	and that's what's going on.
6572000	6578080	So that project is on the shelf now is the last word on that.
6578080	6582240	So rest in peace, EA Star Wars project.
6583280	6586320	Look, you want to take this next one that was marked for Jamie before she left?
6586320	6590560	I'm sure we can do that because I still have this stupid hiccup thing going on.
6590560	6591040	I hate it.
6591040	6594080	Oh no, I'm gonna get more water while you do these stories.
6594080	6602160	All right, so Mega Man X5, you know, was just recently released, re-released, and they've
6602160	6606320	actually taken out some of these Guns N' Roses references.
6606880	6613440	So with the Mega Man X Legacy Collection 1 and 2, I'm not even really sure what the original
6613440	6614800	references were.
6614800	6616240	Oh, I guess so.
6617920	6618400	Let's see.
6619840	6624240	They had, I guess it was with the localization.
6624240	6630880	Oh, so they had, you know, you know, and now that I think of it, didn't they have like
6630880	6635760	references to other stuff or Guns N' Roses stuff and like Super Mario Bros 3 as well,
6635760	6637840	you know, with the Koopas and stuff.
6637840	6642640	Lemmy Koopa after Lemmy and then...
6642640	6646880	They were all named after like punk rock icons, like Wendy O.
6646880	6649600	I guess it makes sense that they all kind of like punk rock anyways.
6649600	6650400	I mean, it makes sense.
6651440	6656080	But yeah, in this game, the boss robots or the big robot things were, they changed names.
6656080	6658080	They didn't use the literal Japanese translations.
6658080	6663360	They made them like, they were like parody names off like people that were in Guns N'
6663360	6663760	Roses.
6663760	6664640	It was a little silly.
6664640	6670080	Yeah, so they decided to go ahead and just basically said that in our mission to make
6670080	6674160	these collections an authentic Mega Man X experience, we took an opportunity to better
6674160	6681840	align the names of the Mega Man X5 Mavericks across all regions for better narrative cohesion
6681840	6686240	across the series, making the names more aligned with the original Japanese versions.
6687040	6692720	We hope the fans appreciate our intent on unifying the Mega Man X Maverick naming conventions
6692720	6693360	after all.
6693600	6697360	Yes, they do.
6699520	6700080	Interesting.
6701200	6701680	I don't know.
6703840	6705280	It's neat, I guess, that they did that.
6706880	6709440	But no one else is also neat and interesting.
6710320	6715600	This whole lawsuit with PUBG Corp and Epic over Fortnite.
6716560	6719920	So they dropped the lawsuit and there's no, we don't know why.
6720480	6724960	They just, they filed the dismissal and that's that.
6725760	6732480	And my thoughts, maybe they just didn't, I mean, honestly, the argument was kind of shallow
6732480	6732880	anyways.
6732880	6738640	They didn't really have any sort of way of, I don't know, they're like, oh yeah, each
6738640	6742240	game has a frying pan and it's a similar type of gameplay.
6742240	6744160	I don't think that was really much to go on.
6744960	6750160	Um, but wasn't there something where like in one country they essentially have like
6750160	6751360	the same parent company?
6752000	6752560	Yes.
6752560	6753200	Yeah.
6753200	6753600	Yes.
6753600	6758160	And so it's like they're essentially suing themselves in one area.
6758160	6762240	So it's a little, you know, maybe together they can work a little.
6762240	6764320	So it may have had something to do with that.
6764320	6767040	It may have been because their suit was kind of weak.
6768160	6768880	Who knows?
6768880	6771360	But I don't know.
6772160	6776000	One other thing that we didn't mention though that I wanted to was there's another lawsuit
6776000	6781840	actually going on with Bethesda and Warner games and see Bethesda released this very
6781840	6786400	popular game that everybody's aware of now called, um, fallout shelter.
6787040	6793680	And so now Warner games had a company, I think that actually had that originally worked on
6793680	6799680	fallout shelter or had access to that code or something came out with a Westworld themed
6799680	6806160	game that looks extremely like fallout shelter, even to the point of having the same type
6806160	6812720	of bugs in their code at launch that fallout shelter had, which made them suspicious that
6813360	6817600	perhaps they were using our old code to create this game perhaps.
6817600	6820400	And so now there's a whole suit against that as well.
6820400	6824800	So we'll have to see how that plays out, but that's kind of where things are going.
6824800	6829280	Lawsuits, lawsuits, lawsuits, some clarifications in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
6829280	6832640	Dungeon buster says 10 cent has a major stake in Epic.
6832640	6835520	They pretty much own them, but only a minor stake in blue holes.
6835520	6837600	So they don't own them at least not yet.
6838880	6843200	And Bobby Black Wolf says, honestly, Bethesda finding stolen code by looking at the bugs
6843200	6845040	is the most with the thing ever.
6845040	6845760	Yes, it is.
6845760	6846320	True point.
6847280	6851040	And some light on the super Mario brothers three localization that you brought up there.
6851760	6853760	Dark Tetsuya says the super Mario thing.
6854320	6859040	A lot of them were references to famous musicians like Lemmy was Lemmy killmeister of Motorhead.
6859680	6861280	Roy was Roy Orbison.
6861280	6863520	And there were a couple others and JD follows up.
6863520	6865600	Wendy Williams, Aggie pop.
6865600	6869760	And Larry was named after no one, but that was all North American localization.
6871200	6871440	Crap.
6871440	6872320	We need one more name.
6872320	6878240	Larry done inky pinky blinky and Sue.
6881920	6883040	Or is it Clyde?
6883040	6885120	I think it was Clyde and Pac-Man and Sue and Ms.
6885120	6886560	Pac-Man anyway.
6887760	6888160	All right.
6889600	6895280	Moving on one more story for you guys before we open up the Skype line over at orange lounge
6895280	6896960	radio, all one word on Skype.
6897600	6900960	How many of you guys have played Shaq Fu a legend reborn?
6900960	6903120	I'm shocked to Loki that you haven't checked this out.
6903120	6905520	I wasn't a fan of the first Shaq Fu game.
6905520	6906480	I mean, it looked okay.
6906480	6908560	Well, it's, it's a legendary born.
6908560	6910960	Now the physical edition just came out this past week.
6910960	6916000	Apparently physical editions of the game have a leaflet with instructions on how to unlock
6916000	6922080	a bonus game called Barack Fu, the adventures of dirty Barry.
6922080	6926080	Which of course the main character is very much Barack Obama.
6926080	6931440	And I believe the way American parody laws and so forth are written.
6931440	6933440	You can parody politicians all you want.
6933440	6938960	If you want to do a game about Shaquille O'Neal and use his likeness, you have to pay him
6938960	6939280	money.
6939280	6942640	You have to, he has to sign away his likeness.
6942640	6948720	But the reason why you had all these political figures in, uh, MBA jam back in the day is
6948720	6953920	because with politicians, you don't owe them that same thing because they are politicians.
6953920	6956800	They are in the public eye, therefore they can be parodied.
6956800	6962080	So, uh, Barack Obama, I guess made a good target for a game like this because they did
6962080	6964240	not have to get his permission for it.
6964240	6969840	So they say, and yes, the game calls itself a parody of one of the greatest heroes of
6969840	6970400	our time.
6971280	6979520	As the ex POTUS on notice, you will step in when the police can't figure out why a number
6979520	6983120	of celebrities have been killed in order to solve the case yourself.
6983120	6987040	And there are some trailers out there if you want to check it out called Barack Fu, which
6987040	6989200	is a side game of Shaq Fu.
6989200	6989920	Let's face it.
6989920	6995040	They are both going to be shitty, but good for some walls, right?
6995600	6996080	Yep.
6996080	6996400	All right.
6997120	6997360	Yeah.
6997360	6999840	Dark to see in chat says, I almost want to check that out.
7000720	7000960	Yep.
7001520	7001840	All right.
7001840	7004560	Anyway, let's get to the Skype line.
7004560	7007360	Orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.
7007360	7011040	I'll do the best I can to talk to you through these hiccups while we wait to see if any
7011040	7011760	calls come in.
7012320	7014320	Do we have any last minute stories?
7014320	7015200	I don't.
7015200	7017520	I looked, we burned through a lot of stuff.
7017520	7020320	It seemed like it was a busy news week, but we burned through a lot of it.
7020320	7022800	I mean, we can just kind of add more fuel to the fire.
7022800	7027520	Basically, uh, Bethesda's Todd Howard said Sony is preventing fallout 76 cross play.
7027520	7028720	Oh, I heard that one too.
7028720	7028960	Yeah.
7029920	7032000	And remember they, they said we're listening.
7032000	7033840	We hear your concerns.
7034400	7036320	Yeah, but they're not going to, they don't hear them right now.
7037440	7040480	They're trying to figure it out for six months from now, maybe, but they're not hearing it
7040480	7040880	right now.
7041600	7041840	All right.
7041840	7043920	We got a call coming in, so let's get to it.
7043920	7044240	Uh, hello.
7044240	7045120	You're on orange lounge radio.
7045120	7045440	Who's this?
7046560	7047840	Hey, uh, Robert.
7047840	7048240	Sorry.
7048880	7049520	What's on your mind?
7050480	7051680	Uh, no, hold on.
7051680	7056560	Um, well, yeah, I wanted to bring up pinball arcade.
7056560	7058080	Oh, right.
7058080	7059040	Fuck that ended.
7059040	7060480	And I forgot to buy the tables.
7060480	7061280	God damn it.
7061920	7063120	Oh, yeah.
7063120	7063360	Yeah.
7063360	7065360	I was going to ask you exactly that.
7065360	7067760	Cause you didn't exactly mention daddy.
7067760	7069040	God damn it.
7069040	7070160	No, I forgot.
7070160	7071600	And the month is now over.
7071600	7072640	No, I went out of town.
7072640	7074480	This is what happens when I go on vacation.
7074480	7079120	So I'll just have to do what everybody else on the internet does and steal them.
7080000	7080080	Hmm.
7080880	7084080	Well, yeah, I wouldn't recommend doing that.
7084080	7087200	Cause I know, no, I wouldn't, I wouldn't either.
7087200	7090320	I want to reward the hardworking developers, but if they're gone, they're gone.
7090320	7091280	You know what I mean?
7091280	7091520	Yeah.
7092240	7092640	Yeah.
7092640	7099520	But, um, yeah, it's kind of a shame that the whole thing with the billion Williams went
7099520	7100640	down like it did.
7100640	7101360	Cause no.
7101360	7104560	Well, well, I mean, we'll just, we'll just have to see what's next.
7104560	7106560	I mean, there's obviously some type of reason for it.
7106560	7111040	So we have to see kind of like, where does the licensing end up going from here?
7111040	7116160	You know, is there, or, or is there a reason they pulled it or was it purely financially
7116160	7116800	motivated?
7116800	7121680	We'll, we'll find out hopefully in the coming year or two as whatever studio maybe has the
7121680	7127200	license now announces what they're working on, whether it be a VR thing or who knows?
7127200	7128880	It could be a variety of mobile phones.
7128880	7129280	Who knows?
7130160	7130560	Yeah.
7130560	7130960	Yeah.
7130960	7137120	I suppose that we could possibly speculate right now as to what the reasons are, but
7137120	7143200	it's simply their speculation and it will be a, probably a complete waste of energy
7143200	7144000	to do that.
7144000	7148240	But it, you know, like you were saying, you're saying it was kind of a shame, you know, you
7148240	7153840	have, you know, you know, got to do everything, got to do lists like that, you know, um, you
7153840	7160320	know, cause unfortunately, uh, you know, while I love pinball, um, unfortunately I've been
7160320	7166560	focusing more on buying the pinball effects, uh, tables and I kind of figured, you know
7166560	7173120	what, the pinball arcade tables will always be around, you know, I'll have full intensive
7173120	7178000	purpose, infant male time to buy the table, so I slacked off on buying that.
7178000	7181920	But I mean, it's not like the pinball effects tables are bad and some of them have like
7181920	7182480	licenses.
7182480	7185680	They're just, they're just not based on anything in reality.
7185680	7187520	But some of those pinball effects tables are great.
7187520	7190880	Like some of their star Wars tables are a lot of fun and you know, they, they have the
7190880	7191920	cool Marvel tables.
7191920	7194160	Didn't pinball effects have the street fighter table too?
7194160	7194960	I think they did.
7194960	7202560	Oh, so the original game yesterday, in fact, I got the speed fire table on the Xbox live.
7203600	7209680	Unfortunately, you know, since, uh, pinball effects never came to steam, as far as I know,
7210400	7211840	I, you know, at least not.
7213120	7214400	FX3 is on steam.
7214400	7215280	I don't know about the original.
7216000	7221600	Yeah, you know, the first two, you know, well, your pinball effects two was on steam is no
7221600	7222480	longer on steam.
7223200	7228240	Uh, you still have access to, uh, you know, two if you bought, you know, bought content
7228240	7232880	for that is, uh, you know, like you said, uh, threes on there as well.
7232880	7238960	And virtually all, all, you know, the tables that you bought onto with the exception of
7238960	7242080	a handful, like, uh, the, the soccer tables.
7242080	7247600	Um, you know, I think, um, the explosion, you know, Miss exposure, man, T1, a couple
7247600	7251280	hours didn't make it, uh, get transferred to three.
7251280	7254880	But other than that, Eric, if you had on two, you could play on three.
7255520	7260320	But yeah, you know, getting back to my initial point before I got some sidetracked, you know,
7261280	7264960	first I got behind the evil, you know, what wanted by tables.
7264960	7268720	I was only able to buy two, uh, yesterday.
7268800	7274160	I managed to get a Jack Bach, you know, about, and the one other one, I forget the name of
7274160	7279360	it, but I would have loved to have bought more, but it's not financially feasible this
7279360	7279680	month.
7279680	7283920	So I kind of like, you know, you snooze, you lose, you know?
7283920	7284240	Yeah.
7284880	7286000	We can only do what we can do.
7286640	7290080	Uh, Bobby Black Wolf is referencing something that came up on his show earlier about the,
7290080	7291600	uh, Jack box Royal.
7291600	7293120	He talked about this on his show.
7293120	7297440	Uh, he would like, and, uh, I guess, I guess I'll say it here, Bobby, since you're convinced
7297440	7302400	they still listen to OLR, if anyone at Jack box still does listen to this show, uh, Bobby
7302400	7306320	Black Wolf thinks you need to do your own version of one versus 100, and that can be
7306320	7308560	your battle Royal game, your Jack box Royal.
7308560	7313760	So, uh, take one versus 100, marry it with, you don't know Jack or trivia murder party
7313760	7318880	or one of those, uh, at what, why not murder Royal trivia murder Royal, honestly.
7318880	7321200	And, uh, yeah, uh, kill a hundred of your friends.
7321200	7321840	It'd be fun.
7321840	7324240	So, uh, Jack box, we're putting that out there.
7324240	7324880	You know what?
7324880	7326160	You know what buddies?
7326160	7327920	You don't even have to pay us for that idea.
7327920	7329680	Just, just having a little shout out in the credits.
7329680	7330320	That's all we want.
7330960	7336400	Now, now that you brought up, uh, uh, the Jack box, uh, party games.
7336400	7343040	Um, and I have a question regarding that and considering that I never played those and
7343040	7346000	only played out the, you don't know Jack games.
7346000	7353280	Uh, no, how would you say they compare to, uh, the, uh, Jack box compares to, you don't
7353360	7358320	know, uh, Jack, is it better to see, is it like Apple store?
7358320	7360240	It's a very similar sense of humor.
7360240	7365520	Um, a lot of the Jack box games in those party packs, there's a lot of voting type of games
7366240	7368400	where there isn't necessarily a definitive answer.
7368400	7371520	Um, it will, you know, prompt you for certain things.
7371520	7374960	But that was always like a good part about like board games, like, you know, something
7374960	7375760	like Pictionary.
7376320	7379520	Pictionary can be serious, but it can also be really funny if you play with a lot of
7379520	7383040	like really disgusting people, then they're going to draw everything really perverted
7383040	7384160	as all the pictures.
7384160	7388000	So that's kind of where Jack box kind of goes is that it gives you just these ideas.
7388000	7390560	And then ultimately the canvas is your idea.
7390560	7393120	There's not a lot that stays on a very linear path.
7393120	7397200	Like you don't know, Jack sort of does, except for what comes to mind trivia murder party,
7397200	7401280	which was kind of like the, you don't know Jack game that wasn't exactly, you don't know
7401280	7404080	Jack, but it was made for mobile phones, that whole sort of thing.
7404080	7407760	Uh, so you can see that, but, uh, I would definitely encourage you to watch some Twitch
7407760	7410640	streams, um, you know, to get a real sense for what the game is.
7410720	7415120	But ultimately I think Jack box is, is a great game for people that like board game night.
7415680	7419920	Um, another group of people I've played Jack box games with and had a lot of success is
7419920	7426240	that you guys know, I was playing these online, um, survivor type games, uh, a couple months
7426240	7426800	ago.
7426800	7431040	And, uh, some of the people like when we were doing calls on Skype, the tribe calls, we
7431040	7434720	call them somewhat, we just play Jack box games to kind of like bond a little bit.
7434720	7437920	Somebody would screen share and we played the Jack box games of the screen sharing.
7437920	7443360	And these are people that usually don't play a lot of video games, but surely would still
7443360	7444640	play board games and stuff.
7444640	7448800	So I think Jack box is great as like digital board games.
7449360	7450640	I think is the best way I can put it.
7452560	7452960	All right.
7452960	7458880	Well, on the final note before I, you know, I'll let you guys go up to take more calls,
7458880	7464720	um, on a note tangentially related to video games.
7464720	7471840	Uh, if some of you may know, you know, over on GOG, you know, granted they predominantly
7471840	7473200	deal in video games.
7473200	7482880	They do have a very small, uh, you know, limited quantity of movies for sale.
7483840	7492320	One of which I highly recommend is, uh, is actually a concert, uh, put on by, uh, you
7492320	7499920	know, the composer of, uh, the whip, the witcher three, uh, wild hunt, uh, you know, where
7499920	7503840	they get a concert, you know, it's all kind of festival over in Poland.
7503840	7504080	Core.
7504080	7507520	It makes total sense because GOG is owned by the same people that made the winter.
7507520	7509920	So it makes sense that that's, that's a thing that they're pushing.
7510560	7510960	Yeah.
7510960	7511280	Yeah.
7511280	7518560	And the nice thing is now they give you multiple resolutions in the video, including 4k.
7518560	7522960	If you happen to have the setup to play 4k videos.
7523520	7529280	So if you like, you know, the witcher series, you'd be like video game music.
7529280	7536560	And if you want something to show off your 4k set up by all means, check out the video.
7536560	7537600	The music's great.
7537600	7539200	The concert's great.
7539200	7546240	And, you know, I mean, I've been watching constantly, uh, for the past two, 24 hours
7546240	7546640	or so.
7548800	7549840	Something to check out.
7549840	7550160	All right.
7550160	7551760	Anyway, have a nice day.
7551760	7552960	You know, take care.
7552960	7553440	Take care.
7553440	7553600	Bye.
7554400	7558320	Uh, and dungeon buster and chat follows up the music for witcher three is really, really
7558320	7558560	good.
7558560	7558800	Yeah.
7558800	7562800	I mean, that whole game was the artist, artistic presentation of that game was so good.
7562800	7567200	When I say artistic, I don't just mean graphics, but music is definitely a part of that art.
7567920	7569920	Orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.
7569920	7573280	If anybody else wants to give us a call and, uh, call in.
7573840	7577280	So I'm trying to, I'm looking at like some of the websites, uh, with some of the gaming
7577280	7578800	news for last minute stories.
7578800	7584640	And I still see stories Loki about destiny to still going, I guess the solstice of heroes
7584640	7589920	event in a crucible playlist changes are coming in July, July for those that are still grinding
7589920	7591040	away on destiny too.
7591040	7595520	Although I wonder if there is going to be a destiny three destiny three at this point.
7595920	7597200	Anyway, we have another call coming in.
7597200	7598240	Hi, you're on orange launch radio.
7598240	7598960	Who's this?
7598960	7600160	Hey, what's going on everyone?
7600160	7600960	It's Rama.
7600960	7601280	Rama.
7601280	7603120	Your mic sucks, but I'll allow it.
7603120	7604240	What's up, buddy?
7604240	7605280	That's not suck.
7605280	7607440	Nobody else has this problem except for you, sir.
7608400	7609280	I don't know.
7609280	7612240	You're going to hear this back and you're going to be like, something sounds different
7612240	7613120	than it used to.
7613120	7614160	All right, well, what's up buddy?
7614720	7621440	Well, in case you have missed it, we had a mini a couple of weeks ago and saw, and we're
7621440	7622960	kind of sad you weren't there for it.
7623280	7627440	I saw the pictures of you and, uh, what the hell does he go by now?
7627440	7630000	Drew Nami, who was the 23rd magus back in the day?
7630000	7630240	Yes.
7630240	7631280	I saw those pictures.
7631280	7634320	I was, uh, I was like, is there a convention going on?
7634320	7637840	I wasn't aware of, but no, he was just visiting New York as, as people sometimes do.
7638720	7638880	Yeah.
7638880	7641440	The funny thing is I had no idea he was in town.
7641440	7643360	I had just gotten out of the movies.
7643360	7644560	I'm just checking Facebook.
7644560	7647360	I'm like, what are you doing here?
7647360	7648720	He's at the way station.
7648720	7652000	So I'm like, I can be there in 35 minutes.
7652960	7654720	And 40 minutes later you made it.
7654720	7655360	No, I'm just kidding.
7655920	7658560	Actually, you actually pretty much on point with that.
7659680	7660960	An accurate read.
7660960	7661840	I love it.
7661840	7666880	Did any other, uh, OLR listeners, people like SSU 100 Mad I Knows in the area, any of the
7666880	7669840	other New York city people, uh, meet up or just.
7669840	7675760	No, no, but, uh, JV must have like these monthly raves I keep forgetting to go to.
7675760	7676000	So.
7677360	7678800	I know I keep seeing the pictures.
7679920	7681760	God, I need to get back to New York city so bad.
7681760	7683680	I know I've been saying that for like five years, but it's true.
7683680	7685680	And Alan's never been, and he really wants to go.
7686320	7690000	Um, I know we're eyeing Toronto for a big trip next year, but New York is definitely
7690000	7690960	on the agenda as well.
7690960	7695280	So just if finances work out well, hopefully I can make that happen.
7696640	7699760	Three days in New York city, four days in Toronto.
7699760	7700560	That's true.
7700560	7703280	Make it make a whole travel the world event.
7703280	7703760	Who knows?
7704800	7705920	I like the sound of that.
7705920	7706640	Me too.
7706640	7710480	Bobby Blackwell says I've actually never actually been to New York either.
7711040	7715040	You know, we just need to find a convention to insert ourselves into and try to do some
7715040	7715680	panels.
7715680	7719600	Maybe I'll ask around to dragon con, see what they're doing in New York that we may be getting
7719600	7719760	on.
7720960	7726160	Oh, I know a lot of conventions coming up and I do keep my ear to them.
7726160	7730240	I have been recruited to staff a convention in DC and one panel.
7730240	7731440	So we'll see how that goes.
7731440	7731920	All right.
7731920	7732720	Sounds good.
7732720	7735920	Well, anything else you want to call it or you want to talk about tonight, my friend?
7735920	7736880	Yes, actually.
7736880	7742400	Now, has it been a game that you have played somewhere down the line and you really enjoyed
7742400	7745840	this game and you say to yourself, I can't believe I slept on this game.
7748320	7752880	Um, that's how I felt about mass effects when I finally got into it, honestly, cause I,
7752880	7757840	I did sleep on that for many years, uh, and then finally came back and, uh, played it
7757840	7760240	later and I was, uh, in love with it.
7760240	7766480	Uh, a game that I felt like I slept on and then I finally came back and checked it out
7766480	7767600	and I liked it a lot.
7767600	7768000	Um,
7773120	7775680	there's so many games that I check out right at release.
7775680	7779040	It's so hard to go back in the archive and visit old things.
7779040	7782960	Loki, is there anything for you like where it's like, oh man, I slept on this.
7782960	7784240	I should have had a better eye on it.
7784720	7789280	Um, no.
7789280	7792080	I mean, I can't think of anything off the top of my head.
7792880	7794960	Um, maybe Minecraft a little bit.
7796720	7797120	Okay.
7797120	7798160	I go with that too.
7798160	7799040	Minecraft.
7799040	7800960	Like what was the big deal?
7800960	7803120	Uh, over in chat at live.vognetwork.com.
7803120	7805440	S2 100 Matt says the South Park games.
7805440	7806560	It's a pretty good answer too.
7807120	7808480	Well, what about you Rama?
7808480	7809360	I'm flipping it on you.
7809360	7810880	What was the game that you wrote off?
7810880	7815760	Ah, okay.
7815760	7816260	Okay.
7817040	7818080	Ooh, you know what?
7818080	7824800	Speaking of like shooty bang bang Pew Pew games, the doom remake would be one where I was like,
7824800	7828160	I kind of wrote it off as a shooty Pew Pew game, but it's actually a lot of fun.
7828160	7829200	I really liked the doom remake.
7829920	7834080	I played that like really couldn't get into it because I felt like the doom remake was
7834080	7838640	like a little bit too, uh, high, high, fast paced for me.
7838640	7840640	So I couldn't, you know, get into it as well.
7840640	7843200	But the old doom games were super fast paced too.
7843200	7846720	So anyway, my friend, I'm going to let you go to see if we can squeeze in any more calls,
7846720	7847520	but thanks for the call.
7848160	7848640	No problem.
7848640	7849280	Appreciate it.
7849280	7849520	Yep.
7849520	7850720	And check the gain on your mic.
7850720	7851120	Trust me.
7851120	7851360	All right.
7851360	7851920	Later buddy.
7852480	7853200	All right.
7853200	7853700	Bye.
7854160	7854640	All right.
7854640	7855920	Uh, let's see.
7855920	7857680	Oh, dark to see us as Fortnite.
7858240	7862000	I didn't think I'd enjoy it, but from playing the switch version, I've been enjoying it.
7862000	7862160	Yeah.
7862160	7865200	There's hella people that are checking out Fortnite now for the first time on the switch.
7865200	7865700	It's crazy.
7866480	7868880	Uh, orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.
7868880	7872080	We'll try to do like a last minute call for calls.
7872080	7876640	Uh, meanwhile, uh, I know a lot of folks are talking about the crew too right now.
7876640	7878720	I didn't realize the crew too would just come out.
7878720	7883440	Yeah, I think, um, I thought they were doing just like beta testing for that.
7884960	7889600	Uh, FIFA 19 is going to be disclosing the odds on the ultimate team packs.
7889600	7894080	So you will know what's in those loot boxes or the odds of getting the loot that you want,
7894960	7898480	which I think is kind of where the industry is kind of forcing things to go.
7899040	7900320	So I guess that's a good thing.
7900320	7900720	I don't know.
7901280	7906720	Anyway, uh, Bobby Black Wolf says, as far as crew two goes, uh, beta testing was last weekend.
7906720	7908480	It came out for realsies this week.
7908480	7910320	The beta testing crashed my router.
7910320	7912480	So this week I bought a new router.
7912480	7912960	Yikes.
7912960	7914560	That sounds pretty bad.
7914560	7916960	I guess I missed that whole beta test cause I was out of town.
7916960	7918000	Pretty good excuse, right?
7918800	7923200	Uh, for those of you that are playing Monster Hunter World, there is a Twilight Fest kicking
7923200	7924880	off on July 13th.
7924880	7928080	You know, they're supposed to be having an event in Final Fantasy 14 around Monster Hunter
7928080	7930000	as well, but I haven't heard the details on that yet.
7930000	7931360	So anyway.
7932080	7932400	All right.
7932400	7934720	Well, sadly, it doesn't look like any more calls are coming in.
7934720	7938160	So I think we are going to start to wrap up for the night and I've still got these hiccups
7938160	7940800	that are just pissing me off.
7940800	7944880	So we're going to go ahead and start to wrap up here, but, uh, as always, we want to thank
7944880	7946960	you guys for tuning into Orange Lounge Radio.
7946960	7950720	And if you like what you heard here, uh, please, uh, tell a friend about the show because we
7950720	7952400	are the show where every gamer has a voice.
7952400	7955840	But, uh, if the voices aren't here to air, we can't air them.
7955840	7959280	So, uh, we don't have a big million dollar website behind us or anything like that.
7959280	7961360	It's just us homegrown.
7961360	7963120	So a word of mouth goes a long way.
7963120	7967200	And you know what, even if you tell your friends, you know, what really helps is a nice five
7967200	7971840	star review on iTunes or Google podcasts, which I think they, they, they kind of changed
7971840	7974480	their podcast app this week.
7974480	7976000	So a lot of you guys are checking that out again.
7976000	7981760	So, uh, a nice five star review wherever you found this call or wherever you found this
7981760	7983520	show would be welcome.
7983520	7984000	Sorry guys.
7984000	7987600	I'm trying to push through these hiccups and like, stop, stop picking me.
7987600	7988160	Stop.
7988160	7988560	Anyway.
7988560	7988880	Yeah.
7988880	7990320	Scare those hiccups out of you.
7990320	7991040	What?
7991040	7993280	Maybe Russia blood blood.
7993280	7994160	Hey, Loki.
7994160	7997440	I still, I'm still blown away that you got this because I know these things ain't cheap.
7997440	7998880	So I hope there was a sale or something.
7998880	8000480	So appreciate it very much.
8000480	8001520	Assume that there was a sale.
8001520	8001760	All right.
8001760	8002240	So, all right.
8002240	8003280	We'll assume there was a sale.
8003280	8003840	All right.
8003840	8005920	Uh, thank you guys so much for listening to the show.
8005920	8008000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
8008000	8009440	Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight.
8010000	8011000	Yeah.
8011000	8015120	Very tempted to go down to Walmart to pick up a SNES classic.
8015920	8017040	Oh, there you go.
8017040	8018640	And you get an NES classic while you're at it.
8018640	8019600	Cause those are back in stock.
8019600	8019760	Yeah.
8019760	8021120	But Alan ordered me one.
8021120	8022000	It's coming on Friday.
8022000	8025120	If they already, they haven't the Rancho one right now.
8025120	8025840	Oh, do they really?
8025840	8027680	Oh, he, he, he already mail ordered it.
8027680	8028560	So we're just waiting on it.
8028560	8032960	So I mean, he didn't know that they were like being reprinted massively.
8032960	8037280	So when he saw one at retail price, he was like, I don't know what the fuck's happening,
8037280	8039040	but I'm buying one for Rob right now.
8039040	8043600	So, which, and I've seen the SNES classics and I've keep like holding off on a bit.
8043600	8046320	Like my kids today were looking at like super Nintendo games.
8046880	8048160	Look at new Mario game.
8048160	8050080	Like, no, that's an old Mario game.
8050080	8051280	Look at Toy Story game.
8051280	8053120	No, that's an old Toy Story game.
8053120	8055760	So I'm like, you know, I could just get one of these.
8055760	8058880	You and I have a raspberry PI, you know, I could really just do a raspberry pilot.
8059520	8063120	I liked the controller and that's the other thing.
8063120	8068000	She was like, I would get an NES classic, but I can just fucking mod the SNES classic
8068000	8069280	to put the NES games on there.
8069280	8070720	So there's really no point.
8071440	8071840	All right.
8071840	8073600	So I'm trying to do that.
8074320	8079200	And my final thought is I get to play Tetris attack in VR and I'm or Tetris effect in VR.
8079200	8082080	And I'm so happy in a few months, in a few months.
8082080	8083840	Yeah, I don't get to do it tonight, but in a few months.
8083840	8085600	So in the meantime, I have rez.
8085600	8090000	I have until dawn rush of blood and I have Skyrim VR, which I really want to check out
8090000	8090640	because I hope I can.
8090640	8091920	I still haven't checked it out yet.
8091920	8093600	I bought it, but I haven't played it yet.
8094880	8096960	But it'll be interesting.
8096960	8100400	I don't know if that's necessarily the best VR game, but it's Skyrim.
8100400	8100880	It's fun.
8101680	8102000	All right.
8102000	8102640	But check out.
8102640	8107280	Yeah, the demo disc and definitely like Job Simulator.
8107280	8108880	Those are pretty fun, of course.
8108880	8110560	Or actually Job Simulator.
8110560	8114000	It can get a little boring because it's a little kitty, but like accounting plus.
8114000	8114560	All right.
8114560	8116160	Or I want to try.
8116160	8116880	I just picked it up.
8116880	8120320	I want to really want to try just in time make because that looks hilarious.
8120320	8122320	It's overly violent, but cute.
8123280	8126080	And so like they have like scenarios.
8126080	8128960	Like, for example, there's one that there's a grandma in the middle.
8128960	8132720	She's like with her walker and stuff, and there's a whole bunch of knife wielding murderers
8132720	8133920	are trying to kill her.
8133920	8137600	And you have to kill them while everything's moving slow.
8137600	8138720	And it's hilarious.
8138720	8139200	All right.
8139200	8143520	I have to get on the PlayStation store and check out all these games that they have now
8143520	8144320	that I can actually play.
8145040	8145360	All right.
8145360	8146560	That's going to do it for another episode.
8146560	8147280	Orange, Andrea.
8147280	8149200	My other final thought is fuck hiccups.
8149200	8150640	This is the worst thing in the world.
8150640	8152640	We'll be back in seven days to do it all over again.
8152640	8157440	Hopefully with less hiccups and more gaming news and more of you guys live and on our
8157440	8158240	podcast feed.
