0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	It's the year of the remaster, the year of the Switch port, the year of the vinyl soundtrack, the year of the battle royale, another year of Mega Man Classic, and the year of the doll.
20000	27000	I'm a year older, as was this show last month. Stay tuned for all this year's news, or at least this week's, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	39000	Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio live tonight.
39000	52000	Episode number 738 for this July 22nd of 2018. Here to talk about video games with y'all assembled in our live chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
52000	60000	We do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com
60000	67000	But you podcast folks out there can participate with us as well throughout the week, through your emails, your tweets, and so forth.
67000	74000	But tonight here in studio, it's me, Rob Roberts, or Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E, joined as always by DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
74000	77000	You could go Skie!
77000	85000	Actually, I'm giving serious thought to changing my Twitter name off of Skie, just because I don't really use that name at all.
85000	92000	The reason why that name comes from, like DDR Freak, like years ago, but I don't really use that name anywhere anymore.
92000	103000	So, you know, because of things like this show that started after the DDR Freak days, or during really, I think people just know me online as Rob Roberts at this point.
103000	105000	So, you know, I probably should have some type of...
105000	109000	JD says don't do it because four-letter usernames on Twitter are rare.
109000	114000	That is true. I think if I do switch it, I will probably keep a sock account.
114000	118000	Because the name I really want is Rob Roberts, but a spammer has it.
118000	123000	So my thought is I'm going to hold the Skie account hostage until Rob Roberts is released.
123000	125000	That's my Twitter thinking right now.
125000	128000	I'm always going to keep DarkSakura because people hate me for it.
128000	129000	Why?
129000	130000	Like complete strangers.
130000	132000	You've got the name I want!
132000	133000	Good!
133000	134000	On Twitter, aren't you underscore O-L-R?
134000	135000	No.
135000	136000	No? Okay.
136000	137000	No.
137000	138000	I couldn't remember.
138000	139000	I'm DarkSakura there because I made that account when Twitter was new.
139000	141000	Yeah, we all got on Twitter pretty quick.
141000	146000	Because, well, if you think a four-letter account is rare, follow the show on Twitter, O-L-R.
146000	151000	We have a three-letter account there and we constantly get tweets for like other things.
151000	152000	It's pretty funny.
152000	153000	Fuck off.
153000	154000	Yeah.
154000	161320	But I still, though my other one Kuro Tsubasa is, I decided because I actually was spelling
161320	165000	Kuro incorrectly for black, it just means crowing.
165000	166000	Mm-hmm.
166000	167000	So.
167000	168000	Works.
168000	169240	Sorry about last week.
169240	172240	We weren't here last week and that was completely my fault.
172240	175180	Without getting into all the gory details, I had food poisoning.
175180	176180	It was awful.
176180	177180	Y'all have been there.
177180	179960	I don't need to say anything else about it.
179960	180960	But I'm fine now.
180960	187360	Like most episodes of that sort of thing, by the time 48 hours had passed, it was like
187360	188560	nothing had ever happened.
188560	192680	So it's just unfortunate that fell on Sunday night because I hate missing episodes.
192680	195120	I hate not being here for y'all.
195120	199000	But I know you all are understanding very much as well and I hope you found some other
199000	204500	good indie shows to listen to last Sunday night or maybe some Twitch streamers and probably
204500	205700	played some games.
205700	208260	I know there's a lot of you playing a lot of different games right now.
208260	212020	We'll get into some of those during our gaming weeks in a minute, but I also have to introduce,
212020	213860	of course, Techmaster Loki.
213860	214860	How are you, Loki?
214860	215860	I'm fine.
215860	216860	Good.
216860	219020	I had a mediocre sandwich from Subway.
219020	221980	Yeah, well, Subway sandwiches tend to be pretty mediocre, but that's just my opinion.
221980	225340	I should have just gone with the one that's by my work because they know what I want there
225340	229340	and they don't even, they're like, you just have the same thing as normal?
229340	230340	Yeah.
230340	231340	It comes out perfect.
231340	238060	Like this one was just like 80% bread and like nothing and she just like slapped everything
238060	242260	on there and it's just, I could tell she was making like, this is going to be terrible.
242260	243740	Is it the Subway right near here?
243740	244740	Cause they're really bad.
244740	247780	No, it's the one right off the freeway by my house.
247780	248780	Okay.
248780	249780	Okay.
249780	250780	Oh yeah.
250780	251780	I made a last minute change in what I wanted to get.
251780	257620	And I got, I went originally into Cafe Rio and then I was like, I'm confused at the calories
257620	264260	of all the chips and salsa they eat on there because the online, it says it's 440 calories
264260	265260	on their menu board.
265260	267260	It says it's 1,340 calories.
267260	270380	So I'm like, that's a big discrepancy.
270380	271380	Depends how much you eat.
271380	272380	I suppose.
272380	276100	Um, that subway, I think that you're talking about is right by where I used to work and
276100	280460	without giving away my whole life story here, but that used to be a Quiznos when it first
280460	281460	opened.
281460	282460	Oh man.
282460	283460	Can you say downgrade?
283460	285460	I would rather be a Quiznos.
285460	286460	Are there any of those still around?
286460	287460	No, I miss those.
287460	288460	Those are good anyway.
288460	291940	We used to have one right around the corner from my house and I used to go there all the
291940	292940	time.
292940	296700	Meanwhile, while the rest of you are mourning Toys R Us and shit.
296700	299380	I'm sitting here going, I miss my Quiznos sandwich.
299380	300460	My toasted sandwiches.
300460	303500	I, I'm like the only person that loved that toasted thing.
303500	306620	Everybody else is like, it was good, but then they'll toast it.
306620	307620	Subway stolen.
307620	309380	You give it subway though.
309380	313540	You toast their sandwich and it's still, it's still garbage toasted a sandwich like you
313540	315100	would like you would bake a pizza.
315100	316620	It went through that slow conveyor belt.
316620	320420	It was all, yeah, it like it was good and like they put like, you know, I'd get a steak
320420	325020	sandwich and I had, you know, the Rosemary Parmesan bread with the nice sauce and like
325020	329740	drool and the onions and everything and then come through and you're just like, I don't
329740	332860	need you to do anything that sandwiches cut in half and it's ready to go.
332860	336300	It's just, it's perfect, but that is beautiful.
336300	339900	The problem is it was like I take that sandwich and I go to subway and there is no amount
339900	343940	of sandwich that they could give me that would equal to that sandwich.
343940	345500	It's just, it's not the same.
345500	348460	So I, yeah, it's unfortunate.
348460	349460	All right.
349460	352700	Uh, enough food talk, but it wouldn't be OLR if we didn't deviate into food talk at some
352700	353700	point.
353700	358380	So now we get into our kickoff topic, which as we usually do after a week off is getting
358380	360820	into what we missed the week before.
360820	365340	But um, let me quickly ask, did you guys do anything with the extra time on Sunday since
365340	368540	I know, I saw her, I had to do it kind of last minute, but y'all know how it is.
368540	372500	So did you guys get to do anything fun with your extra unexpected Sunday night off?
372500	375260	I played Pokemon go and saw ant man and wasp.
375260	376260	Okay, cool.
376260	378640	I figured, I figured some Pokemon go might happen.
378640	381620	I stayed in my pajama, not wearing any pants.
381620	382620	Nice.
382620	388460	And then watched, uh, like videos on a YouTube fan fell down a YouTube hole.
388460	393880	That's, that's always a fun way to waste the same thing yesterday is great because I had
393880	400880	an unexpected Saturday off because my schedule, my work, our schedules are start on Saturday.
400880	406740	So because I'm now on a training schedule for another department, yes, um, I had yesterday
406740	407740	off.
407740	408740	Nice.
408740	411740	And that's why I get to be for a whole show just about tonight.
411860	412860	Yay.
412860	413860	Exciting.
413860	414860	All right.
414860	416620	Uh, let's get into some of the topics for the show.
416620	421460	So let's talk about some of the news that we missed last week when we were unexpectedly
421460	422460	off.
422460	427620	So, uh, talking about some Nintendo news, um, apparently, uh, Nintendo had made a comment
427620	431820	about they're not yet at the point where they can announce the entire product lineup for
431820	432820	the autumn.
432820	436140	That was a quote that came out, which seems very strange because autumn is exactly not
436140	437140	that far away.
437140	438140	Now.
438140	440860	We talked about this a little bit at the tail end of Bobby black will show on the call.
440980	442900	I do want to repeat a little bit of it.
442900	445460	Usually I would just tell you, you need to go listen to it to hear it.
445460	447580	But I think part of what we discussed there was really important.
447580	449060	I do need to repeat it.
449060	454940	Um, because my theory on this whole, why Nintendo is waiting forever on this online thing is
454940	460020	that I think Nintendo is really pushing to get something really big out.
460020	461360	That's going to be digital only.
461360	463820	So and I, I think I talked about last show we were here.
463820	468300	I thought something like NES remix, but maybe bigger, something that's going to be download
468300	472940	only that is going to be a big flagship thing for the online service and that they're really
472940	474100	trying to push to get that out.
474100	477860	And actually dark soccer, you said animal crossing, um, as kind of like an offhanded
477860	478860	comment.
478860	482660	And I was kind of like, well, I don't know if it would be that big, but at the same time,
482660	487640	I don't necessarily think that's a, that's a completely off base projection, you know,
487640	491140	because I would think animal crossing is something that maybe deserves a retail release in a
491140	498860	box, but animal cross crossing would also make a really great, like online only download
498860	499860	type of thing.
499860	502660	So I don't hate that idea actually at all.
502660	507420	I'd like an animal crossing MMO and that, and that could be something that, you know,
507420	508420	is pushing the online.
508420	511100	Anyway, my point is with this whole thing, whatever it is that they're working, because
511100	512540	I don't want to get people's hopes up either.
512540	513680	Oh, it's animal crossing.
513680	514680	Maybe not.
514680	517100	It could be, you know, again, think along the lines of NES remix, something you just
517100	518380	haven't thought of yet.
519140	523940	But my thought is that they are really aggressively trying to get that out by October, but right
523940	526740	now Nintendo is in a phase where they're not sure if they're going to make it.
526740	531220	So if they don't make it, then expect that Nintendo direct to be, Oh, it's the online
531220	533100	classics and some little things.
533100	535620	And we're all going to be sitting here going, that's it.
535620	536740	That's what we were waiting for.
536740	540500	But the hype of playing classics online will be kind of cool.
540500	544780	But if Nintendo is able to make the timeline, then we'll get something really big.
544780	547700	But if they miss October, obviously this big thing would just slip into 2019.
547700	548700	We'd get it eventually.
548700	549700	I'd be more curious.
549700	554540	So which games are actually going to use online services because the, how many online, there's
554540	556220	all a whole ton of online games.
556220	560620	I think I'm well, Splatoon two and a smash brothers obviously going to be the huge one
560620	564940	smash brothers when they're expecting everybody to use rocket league and Mario Kart eight
564940	565940	is on card eight.
565940	566940	Maybe a Fortnite.
566940	567940	Fortnite.
567940	568940	Absolutely.
568940	569940	Fortnite.
569940	570940	Yeah.
570940	574260	So, um, yeah, there's, if you really sit down, I mean, maybe not Zelda, breath of the wild
574260	577980	and Mario Odyssey so much, although Mario Odyssey does have the online leaderboards,
577980	581380	but um, you know, maybe not that stuff so much, but there's a fair amount of Nintendo
581380	585400	houses that are using the online.
585400	588660	So anyway, um, some other things that we missed while we were gone.
588660	593940	Speaking of Splatoon two, there was a big, uh, 3.2 0 update with some bug fixes and some
593940	596580	weapon and sub tweaks, uh, that happened.
596580	601660	Uh, let's see the eighties arcade platformer Toki is getting a switch release and a wooden
601660	603540	arcade cabinet to go with that.
603540	604540	Hmm.
604540	609500	Uh, Reggie Fils-Aime talked about the super Mario movie and potential other partnerships.
609500	614500	Uh, in an interview with IGN, he said quotes like, certainly our focus from a Nintendo
614500	618380	perspective as well as working with such an accomplished partner like illumination is
618380	622300	to make sure that what is created is something both fans will love as well as it will be
622300	627020	a great introduction to folks who are not as familiar with the world of Mario.
627020	631060	So most of that is smoke and mirrors, hype chat, but the interesting part of that to
631060	636180	me is that they are making a movie that is geared towards people who may not know who
636180	646080	Mario is, which to me at this point, who doesn't know who Mario is like everybody, especially
646080	649620	our age and younger knows who Mario is.
649620	653940	Even most folks, probably about 10 years older than us, you know, so we're talking about
653940	658540	like maybe when you start to get to like the 65 and older, they don't, that's all my kids
658540	664220	do is they watch, I literally, my kids watch super Mario Odyssey playthroughs all the
664220	665220	time.
665220	668260	I'm like, I asked him once, I'm like, why though?
668260	669320	Cause you beat the game.
669320	671340	So why are you watching people play the game?
671340	672580	I'm like, that doesn't make any sense.
672580	675500	But my youngest son who's not very good at the game, he's just watching people play the
675500	679980	game and yeah, I really can't say anything about that cause that's all I do on Twitch.
679980	680980	I watch people play games.
680980	682500	Are they watching Mario marathon?
682500	684980	No, they're watching just Mario Odyssey.
684980	689780	They want random YouTubers, whoever comes up in the YouTube kids apps, which I don't
689780	694580	even know how it picks up Mario Odyssey cause I don't think that they're actually typing
694580	695580	anything in.
695580	700620	That's the, that's the YouTube market I should have aimed for to try to get more people to
700620	704820	actually subscribe to my channel so I could, you know, like actually make money on Twitch
704820	709340	is like, I should do play throughs aimed at kids and use crazy voices.
709340	711940	No, it's not the crazy voices or anything.
711940	713980	It's literally just the game that they're playing.
713980	715680	It's not a YouTube app.
715680	723100	It's just basically if you have to think dumber because no, no, I'm not saying that kids are
723100	724100	dumb.
724100	726540	I'm saying they don't like at that age, they don't know how to read.
726540	728340	They don't like, my son doesn't know how to read.
728340	730660	I mean he can sometimes recognize stuff, but he doesn't know how to read.
730660	735460	He goes off pictures and so sure, you know, he likes Mario Odyssey because you know, his
735460	738980	brother plays it and I play it and he liked, he plays it too.
738980	742420	And he sees a picture, Oh, Mario brothers and clicks on the picture and then that's
742420	743420	it.
743860	745400	He can't be a streamer in another language.
745400	749660	He doesn't, he can't understand a thing they're saying, but he's watching it because it's
749660	751420	Mario and then he wants to watch Mario.
751420	752420	Okay.
752420	756140	But I mean, I feel like you told this exact same story a year ago, but it was Minecraft.
756140	757780	Well, they still do that.
757780	759400	In fact, my son went back to pop.
759400	763020	He's still watching popular MMOs, which is a mine craft.
763020	767740	Uh, you know, it's a pair of streamers that will do Minecraft stuff.
767740	769060	And so he's, he's totally watching that.
769060	772660	And then my, my kids like keeps talking, talking about hello neighbor and stuff.
773340	775100	How do you know about these games?
775100	776980	Like in five nights at Freddy's and stuff like that.
776980	780300	I'm like, where are you watching this stuff?
780300	785740	So okay, before I let this go though, let me ask you guys and asking the, uh, chatters.
785740	786740	Okay.
786740	793740	So instead of Mr. Rogers neighborhood, Mr. Robert's neighborhood and it's video games,
793740	795960	you better teach them about love and that they're special.
795960	798340	I would, I would at the end of the day, I don't know, man.
798340	800960	And I would say, you know, don't bully the other kids.
800960	801960	Don't be an asshole.
801960	802960	Like your older boy.
802960	807800	I guess I can't say that there's a fine line between, between coming off as a pedophile
807800	808800	and coming off.
808800	811920	And you are also not a Presbyterian minister, Rob.
811920	812920	Just saying.
812920	816820	Well, I mean I could join like the universal Unitarian or whatever that thing is.
816820	817820	You just pay 30 bucks.
817820	818820	Unicornian.
818820	819820	Unicornian.
819820	820820	Sure.
820820	821820	That works.
821820	822820	I like unicorns.
822820	824600	In this way.
824600	827080	Where's that Twitter meme in this house?
827080	829560	We worship unicorns.
829560	830560	That's it.
831160	834880	Cause then we could get like a tax break.
834880	835880	I'm serious.
835880	837560	Let's, let's form the unicornian church.
837560	838560	All right.
838560	839560	I'm, I'm thinking about it.
839560	841240	I don't have to, I have to look into that.
841240	842240	Yeah.
842240	844200	In Alabama, there's the church of the great green frog.
844200	845200	Sorry.
845200	846200	They're Mississippi.
846200	847200	Uh, flying speed.
847200	849200	The great green hippo toad.
849200	852000	They give you a get out of hell free card at conventions.
852000	853000	I have one somewhere.
853000	854000	All right.
854000	855000	Anyway.
855000	856000	Come in handy.
856000	857500	JD said it's the universal life church.
857500	859600	It's the one where you pay a fee and can marry people.
859640	865320	Some, I actually almost was going to do that for a friend's wedding.
865320	869160	But then they ended up, they were like, actually, we're going to have to like scale this whole
869160	870560	thing back into a courthouse wedding.
870560	872240	And I was like, all right, you got to do what you got to do.
872240	874920	But yeah, because I remember starting to go through the motions for that.
874920	880200	So I, yeah, Rob Roberts, a future minister, if you want to Rob Roberts wedding, Mr. Roberts
880200	881200	neighborhood.
881200	882200	Anyway.
882200	886000	Uh, Reggie, Reverend Robert's neighborhood, Reverend Roberts.
886000	887640	Oh my God.
887680	892560	I sound like, Oh God, I sound like the type of Reverend Robert sounds like I ought to
892560	893560	be like a gun owner.
893560	894560	Actually.
894560	898040	I think if you like Google Rob Roberts, like you don't always get me, but I think you get
898040	899260	like a gun guy.
899260	903240	And I'm like, Jesus, of course, of course, the most popular Rob Roberts is probably like
903240	904240	a gun guy.
904240	905240	All right.
905240	906240	Anyway.
906240	907240	Um, moving on.
907240	912640	Um, other partnerships, the quote from Reggie, we see ourselves as making a worldwide consumers
912640	914480	smile through our intellectual property.
914480	915900	Fundamentally, we do that four ways.
915900	920800	We do a mobile, do you, uh, we do it with our licensed relationship with other companies
920800	921860	like Kellogg's.
921860	925060	We have other entertainment, which is where we put universal studios and illumination.
925060	927060	Then we have our dedicated video game business.
927060	928620	This is a key part of our strategy.
928620	933500	This is an area where we are having a range of conversations, just like we did for the
933500	935280	other big two partnerships.
935280	937780	When we have something to announce, we will.
937780	943020	So maybe there will be other very large Nintendo partnerships to come in the future.
943020	944020	Who knows?
944020	949540	Uh, more news that we missed on the week off, uh, job listings at Sony talking about an
949540	954580	unannounced PS4 and PC MMORPG.
954580	956660	So could that be a Sony online entertainment game?
956660	963260	Could that be like EverQuest three or something or DC universe two or, I mean, something new
963260	967380	would always be a great thing too, but certainly gets the head spinning on that.
967380	972980	Also other games, a PS4 arcade robot action game, a PS4 strategy, RPG, and a multi-platform
972980	974780	3d fighting action game.
974780	976380	I like robots and action.
976380	977380	That's true.
977380	978380	Robots and action.
978380	979380	Good things.
979380	980380	Uh, let's see.
980380	981380	Other things.
981380	982380	Robots in disguise.
982380	986740	Um, it's always sunny in Philadelphia, the TV show, which I'm surprised is actually still
986740	987740	on.
987740	988740	That's not an almost.
988740	989740	So I think they're almost done.
989740	991180	I was like, that's not a dig.
991180	995460	That show is really funny, but it's been on a really long, it's the 13th season.
995460	1000340	Like they're all going to be as old as Danny DeVito was when it started.
1000340	1001340	You know what I mean?
1001820	1006020	Anyway, uh, they're, they're getting a mobile game out of that.
1006020	1007020	It's always sunny in Philadelphia.
1007020	1008020	So yes.
1008020	1010260	And I will play that mobile game.
1010260	1011260	It's going to be garbage.
1011260	1015180	It's just going to be like the office space game I have, but I will play that game.
1015180	1018800	I have actually stopped playing the office space game, but I will totally play the it's
1018800	1020660	always sunny in Philadelphia game.
1020660	1023740	Uh, the company mono or mondo, excuse me.
1023740	1028620	Uh, this might be a winter star Sakura mondo is releasing a vinyl soundtrack for Dracula
1028620	1030420	X Rondo of blood.
1030420	1031540	I need this in my life.
1031540	1034100	That's something, I guess they had some at San Diego comic con.
1034100	1038460	So why isn't somebody getting me one, but I guess there will be an actual release of
1038460	1039460	this later.
1039460	1041900	I will have it and I will frame it because I don't have a record player.
1041900	1043340	I thought you might enjoy that.
1043340	1047380	Uh, also Shenmue one and two HD going to have some changes.
1047380	1049220	The brand of products will be gone.
1049220	1050700	I'm sure that's no surprise to anyone.
1050700	1055860	Those, you know, brand partnerships are long gone and the load times will be cut.
1055860	1056860	Well that's good.
1056860	1059460	No, my long load times.
1060340	1061340	God damn it.
1061340	1062340	I hate the future.
1062340	1065100	I'm going to miss those.
1065100	1070660	Remember back in the good old days where you'd have to load star comma eight comma one and
1070660	1074740	then you have to sit there while it loads for 10 minutes off one side and then flip
1074740	1077420	the disc over and it's got to load off the other side.
1077420	1078420	Why can't we have that?
1078420	1081940	How many, but Rob, how many terabytes was that?
1081940	1084980	Oh, it was one megabyte or not even.
1084980	1085980	It was okay.
1085980	1086980	Loki.
1086980	1087980	It was a Commodore.
1087980	1088980	No, hold on.
1089500	1090500	64.
1090500	1091500	64 kilobytes.
1091500	1095660	Apple two E. Same code to run the damn games.
1095660	1098500	And I was good at kicks.
1098500	1106100	Uh, anyway, um, so a street fighter 30th anniversary collection international got a new trailer
1106100	1107100	and a release date.
1107100	1112900	So the Japanese version will have the localized versions and the different names of the bosses
1112900	1114460	in Japanese text.
1114460	1117940	So Capcom giving into the fan demands there, which is a good thing.
1117940	1118940	I really think.
1118940	1122860	Uh, and there will be an official guide for mega man 11, which is notable.
1122860	1126940	It's the first mega man guide since 2006.
1126940	1128180	So there you go.
1128180	1133200	That's a little bit about what you missed last week when we had the night off with OLR.
1133200	1136660	Let's talk a little bit about what we've been up to this week and maybe a little last week
1136660	1140860	too in our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing.
1140860	1141860	Dark soccer.
1141860	1142860	How about you?
1142860	1149940	Um, Kirby and then watching Mario marathon and then playing a Pokemon go because I feel
1149940	1152020	bad that I'm not giving gifts to everybody.
1152020	1157260	So I actually travel outside of my neighborhood to go hit pokey stops in my car driving under
1157260	1158560	20 miles an hour.
1158560	1160220	I see that as a good thing and a bad thing.
1160220	1161220	You know what I mean?
1161220	1164260	It's a good thing cause it motivates you to get out of the house.
1164260	1165260	It's the Pokemon.
1165260	1169820	Pokemon go does not let me live my hikikomori a fantasy, but at the same time I think you
1169820	1173180	have to like let that obligation go a little bit.
1173180	1177680	Like Jamie, if I'm gonna tell you right now, if you forget to send me a present one day,
1177680	1178680	it's okay.
1178680	1181100	Did you haven't opened my present for three days?
1181100	1182220	I can't.
1182220	1183300	I can't.
1183300	1184300	You did it today.
1184300	1185300	So I forgive you.
1185300	1186300	Okay.
1186300	1187300	Okay.
1187300	1192500	Um, but I'm just saying, you know, it's, you know, I, I, I remember to take it out a little
1192500	1195900	bit more often when I'm out and about like, you know, when I was at my delicious Thai
1195900	1197900	lunch, we were by two pokey stops.
1197900	1199500	So I did gyms.
1199500	1205940	I raided by myself when I went to a certain market that someone told me had those chocolates
1205940	1210620	that I like and I spent way too much money there.
1210620	1211620	My bad.
1211620	1212620	Right.
1212620	1218960	Um, and then, um, I don't know, I've just been kinda sitting back.
1218960	1222360	I want to, um, actually hook up my steam link cause well, I actually don't think it's going
1222360	1226460	to work in the room that we've moved our CRT to cause we hooked up the CRT in the office
1226460	1230140	so that I can start streaming, um, stuff off the SNES.
1230140	1231140	Nice.
1231140	1237580	Um, but I'm actually considering because, and I'm not, but I'm actually considering
1237580	1242220	streaming games that I don't want to play if people will donate to my GoFundMe for my
1242220	1246860	mom cause she got fired from her job, which we're pretty sure has to do with age and gender
1246860	1253140	discrimination cause it's Alabama, which is a right to work state, which is just completely
1253140	1254140	terrible.
1254140	1255140	There's no protection.
1255380	1261220	They actually broke some very things that would actually have their HR sued out here.
1261220	1263380	They just flat out told her some garbage.
1263380	1267940	So, um, so I've got to keep my mom in her home for three more months until she gets
1267940	1268940	her widow benefits.
1268940	1274020	So if you want to see me play shit, I hate halo is halo on the table.
1274020	1277620	Halo's on the table, but I'd have to play it over here so I'd come over on a Friday
1277620	1278620	night.
1278620	1279620	We'll figure it out.
1279620	1280620	We'll make it work.
1280620	1281620	Okay.
1281620	1282620	Shoot.
1282700	1286500	I might figure out how to get everything up and running.
1286500	1287500	All right.
1287500	1288500	Get that going.
1288500	1291780	I'll put the minute they see you up there streaming stuff, they'll, they'll be more
1291780	1294380	inclined to make you play bad stuff.
1294380	1295380	We'll see.
1295380	1296380	Oh, I don't know.
1296380	1301980	I'm planning on playing, uh, the, uh, hive swap, um, dating SIM cause I've picked up
1301980	1306460	all eight episodes of it last night cause I like dating Sims.
1306460	1308700	I'm trying to think what terrible game I really want Jamie to play.
1308700	1311220	I got to really like stew on this for a little bit anyway.
1311220	1312220	All right.
1312300	1314940	Other games in our gaming week, Loki, how about you?
1314940	1319900	Um, well this week I went ahead cause they had the whole Amazon prime days thing.
1319900	1323940	So we decided to get a 4k TV.
1323940	1328980	So we got a 4k TV and then of course to go along with it, I picked it, I traded in my
1328980	1332180	PlayStation four for a PlayStation four pro.
1332180	1338480	And so now I have that hooked up and I picked up, um, I think of horizon zero dawn to play
1338480	1339480	that.
1339480	1345720	The problem though is because I have a 4k TV, the kids want to play Disney infinity
1345720	1352200	on it just for no reason, even though that doesn't benefit from 4k or the pro at all.
1352200	1356160	And then my wife keeps watching house on it because you know, because you know, house
1356160	1363120	is just such a current and you know, a current show we haven't watched already, but whatever.
1363120	1365520	So I have literally gotten the play horizon zero.
1365520	1367560	I actually haven't gotten the play horizon zero dawn.
1367560	1374020	I got to watch part of the intro before the kids like, Oh my fucking God, I just want
1374020	1377400	to see what the 4k looks like already.
1377400	1381520	So unfortunately I haven't got to touch much in console gaming this week.
1381520	1384000	Um, it's mostly been Pokemon go.
1384000	1388360	Um, and even I'm kind of disappointed, so I haven't even got to play my SNES classic
1388360	1390800	very much, even though I've modded the hell out of that.
1390800	1394960	Um, because once again, I haven't been able to touch the TV.
1394960	1402640	Um, what I have been doing in place of playing games on TV is I've been, I don't know what
1402640	1403840	prompted me to do this.
1403840	1408560	I think I was looking, Oh, I remember now cause I wanted to do like, start working on
1408560	1411840	a third person shooter to create a third person shooter.
1411840	1418600	And I was kind of disappointed with what was available for unity and kind of some of the
1418600	1424520	template, not really templates, but like some of the like lessons or whatever to kind of
1424520	1426760	roll your own third person shooter engine type thing.
1426760	1428680	And it just was not looking great.
1428680	1432060	So I decided, Hey, you know what, maybe I should just work outside of unity and look
1432060	1433340	at some other engines.
1433340	1439660	So I've been teaching myself unreal four, um, this week and actually actually this weekend
1439660	1440840	last week.
1440840	1445160	And so I've been going through some stuff in that and I really like how the engine kind
1445160	1448080	of makes things a little bit easier to make it look nice.
1448080	1453040	And they have a lot of presets for, you know, doing a first person shooter or third person
1453040	1457000	shooter game and all that kind of stuff because that's what the engines for.
1457000	1458240	So it makes sense.
1458240	1460640	Um, so I haven't really gotten into the programming yet.
1460640	1466000	I've been actually teaching myself the blueprint stuff in the meantime, which it's a little
1466000	1470000	bit getting used to because I, you know, I like sometimes just being able to type stuff
1470000	1473640	in there instead of having to do all this arbitrary linking of stuff.
1473640	1475480	But I still, I like it.
1475480	1476560	It's still pretty easy.
1476560	1481280	Um, and I was messing around with it and you know, was able to build things that look nice.
1481280	1486000	So, um, I do have something I'm working on that will be done probably this week.
1486000	1490940	So it just like as a, you know, finish something just to learn type thing.
1490940	1493360	So there's that.
1493360	1496840	Then once I finished them, I can say, shut the fuck up about me finishing something cause
1496840	1497840	it's done.
1497840	1498840	See, there you go.
1498840	1499840	Aaron, fuck off.
1499840	1500840	Yeah.
1500840	1503360	But I'm hoping to learn a little bit more with that cause I think actually this might
1503360	1508240	be a better option than unity for me cause it seems that I don't know, I'll have to figure
1508240	1510400	out what the strengths and weaknesses are.
1510400	1514480	And today of course, you know, I'm a terrible, terrible, terrible game developer and the
1514480	1519840	fact that I never use version control, uh, or source control or whatever.
1519840	1525120	So I had to teach myself how to use, um, those behaviors bite you in the ass.
1525120	1526120	Yeah.
1526120	1531000	So I had to, I had to teach myself how to use source tree and get bucket today, um,
1531000	1532000	bit buckets.
1532000	1534240	So finally got that to work.
1534240	1539680	Um, because even the lessons that I'm following, um, what they said to do didn't work.
1539680	1543040	So I had to figure it out myself through the terminal and I finally got that to work.
1543040	1544600	But yes, I have source control now.
1544600	1545800	So that, that's great.
1545800	1548160	I'm, I'm doing all the right things.
1548160	1552720	Uh, our pal Bobby Black Wolf says, I honestly think the blueprint stuff in UE4 will be better
1552720	1553720	for Loki.
1553720	1554720	It is.
1554720	1558360	And I, but I do want to learn the C plus plus stuff as well.
1558360	1563960	But um, honestly, I don't think that there's really any downside to using the blueprint
1563960	1570120	stuff because I optimization wise, it's about the same where it's like in unity, it can
1570120	1571120	get fun.
1571120	1575080	And it's just like even getting stuff to look nice and unity is such a pain in the ass.
1575080	1579500	Whereas unreal is just fucking gorgeous out the, I mean you can make crap and it looks,
1579500	1581200	it's so amazing looking crap.
1581200	1584480	I mean, I just, I like how easy that is.
1584480	1587340	So I'm curious to see how this will go.
1587340	1592200	So I'm optimistic, but I've been, I've been, see, I've been working on stuff.
1592600	1593600	All right.
1593600	1594600	Haven't haven't let go of it.
1594600	1599800	I do want to play some 4k gaming and I want to try the PlayStation VR now that I've got
1599800	1605160	something that'll, you know, output better, but I don't know, we'll just have to wait
1605160	1606160	and see.
1606160	1607160	All right.
1607160	1611240	Uh, my gaming week, uh, let's see, I've been playing Pokemon go as well.
1611240	1612240	Why not?
1612240	1613240	I'll just add onto that.
1613240	1615840	I participated in the Zapdos day yesterday for a little bit.
1615840	1619400	I had a rehearsal for a, which I guess I should give a cheap plug.
1619400	1623280	Clue is finally happening this Saturday, uh, here in Sacramento at the colonial theater.
1623280	1625280	So that's the big thing I've been preparing for.
1625280	1629080	So we had a rehearsal, so I couldn't do the Zapdos the entire time, but I was able to
1629080	1631000	do the first two hours.
1631000	1635040	And in that time we rated like 10 different things and I did get a shiny Zapdos.
1635040	1639480	So it was like one of the lowest possible appraisals, but eh, I'll take it.
1639480	1640480	It was fun.
1640480	1643520	So, um, yeah, just trying to keep getting XP.
1643520	1645540	Speaking of getting XP, I should mention this too.
1645540	1650740	So not Pokemon go, but Niantic's other game, Ingress, um, I hit level 16 on, congratulations.
1650740	1653420	That is a big pain in the ass.
1653420	1656260	I hit the maximum possible level you can hit in that game.
1656260	1660260	So it's, it's similar to being 40 and Pokemon go, but obviously they're different games.
1660260	1665580	So, uh, I actually, I, I, so they kind of had an event going on.
1665580	1669820	It just finished like two hours ago, but Niantic was like buffing the experience for portal
1669820	1671440	deploys.
1671440	1675480	And so I was really able to use that to my advantage, um, by going down and like to the
1675480	1676880	capital and stuff and deploying.
1676880	1683000	So I actually, uh, timed it so that my last, uh, the thing that got me level 16 is I deployed
1683000	1689160	on the state capital, a reso one and a reso six, and that gave me a level 16 and yeah,
1689160	1690160	super nerdy.
1690160	1691160	Right.
1691160	1692160	So, uh, but that was cool.
1692160	1693160	So a big accomplishment.
1693160	1698520	So, um, I wanted to be one of the first players that got to 1640.
1698520	1701480	So level 16 in ingress and level 40 in Pokemon go.
1701480	1705480	But one of my buddies here locally, uh, from both those games actually just, he just hit
1705480	1707480	40 and Pokemon go this past week.
1707480	1709280	And so it made him the first player in Sacramento.
1709280	1710280	Who's a 1640.
1710280	1712760	So that's, so I hope to follow in his footsteps.
1712760	1716960	Uh, that's, I'll probably be, I'm still waiting to level up from whatever level I'm at.
1716960	1719040	Cause I'm already like 2 million over the cap.
1719040	1720040	Oh yeah.
1720040	1721040	It's like a badge.
1721040	1722040	You're locked in with bad.
1722040	1723040	Yeah.
1723040	1724040	I'm locked in with badges.
1724040	1725040	So, and yeah, I just don't care.
1725040	1728280	It eventually will come, which is, yeah.
1728280	1729280	When it's ready.
1729280	1732480	Um, so anyway, so yeah, that was my AR gaming.
1732480	1734960	And then when the Harry Potter game comes out, I'm going to try to get max level in
1734960	1735960	that.
1735960	1738880	Assuming the game is as good as, you know, ingress and Pokemon go here about the new
1738880	1739880	update.
1739880	1740880	They have like new updates coming.
1740880	1743660	Well, obviously you always have new updates coming for Pokemon go, but they've got some
1743660	1745280	new like lucky Pokemon now.
1745280	1746280	Yeah.
1746280	1748680	I heard about this thing that, um, I guess the latest version of date, cause they're
1748680	1751880	implementing the Celebi quest are probably going to go live next week or the rest of
1751880	1752880	us.
1752880	1754780	Uh, Shane got his when he went to go fest.
1754820	1758460	So, but the rest of us get to get a Celebi soon, um, which, Oh, the speaking of Shane
1758460	1761060	going to go fest, he brought me back a Torco tour.
1761060	1762060	Is that a Torco?
1762060	1763060	Yeah.
1763060	1764060	The little turtle, the turtle.
1764060	1765060	Yeah.
1765060	1766060	So, uh, that's cool.
1766060	1769420	Cause I got that in my pokey decks and then, uh, JD was in Florida recently and it's supposed
1769420	1771500	to be bringing me a hair across and a course solo.
1771500	1772500	So I'm really excited.
1772500	1773500	Yay.
1773500	1774500	So that'll really help with my decks.
1774500	1775500	Now.
1775500	1776500	I just need mr.
1776500	1777500	Mime and King King is gone.
1777500	1779500	Um, so I guess I'll have to go to Australia.
1779500	1780500	I don't know.
1780500	1781500	Anyway.
1781500	1783540	Um, well they'll probably like do some event where they'll swap it over here.
1783540	1787060	And they had Kangaskhan in Anaheim at one point when they did Pokemon worlds.
1787060	1788060	Remember that?
1788060	1792140	And some of the crazies here drove all the way to Anaheim to get a fucking Kangaskhan,
1792140	1794260	which is like what an eight hour drive down there.
1794260	1797020	But you know, what does it is then go to Disneyland.
1797020	1798020	Yeah, I know.
1798020	1799020	Right.
1799020	1800020	Yeah.
1800020	1802060	It's like, you can't, you can't exactly say you're crazy going all the way to Anaheim
1802060	1803060	just to get a Kangaskhan.
1803060	1806340	If you're going to like swing by Disneyland, why there we'll just think about the mad mad
1806340	1809100	pokey stops that are going to be in Nintendo land whenever that opens.
1809100	1810100	Oh, right.
1810100	1811100	I'm sure.
1811100	1812820	Well, they're going to have to get submitted and go through that whole process, but I'm
1812820	1814220	sure it'll, I'm sure it'll fill out really.
1814220	1815220	I don't know.
1815220	1819900	Will Nintendo be able to submit players will do it in a heartbeat.
1819900	1820900	Yeah, absolutely.
1820900	1821900	Anyway.
1821900	1825260	Um, so non mobile AR gave me stuff I play cause there's been other stuff.
1825260	1828380	So, um, this just released this past week and it was kind of like one of those, I didn't
1828380	1833220	realize this was coming and uh, I had to get it when I saw that tempest 4,000 came out
1833220	1834220	this week.
1834220	1838180	Uh, it's a kind of the spiritual successor in many ways to tempest 2000.
1838180	1841860	No, it's this, it's the direct successor to tempest 3000.
1841900	1842900	Right.
1842900	1847540	Well, but wasn't 3000 kind of like 3000 was really just, you can't call it a spiritual
1847540	1850460	successor when it's actually in the same series.
1850460	1853980	Spiritual successor would mean it's a different series, but a similar game.
1853980	1854980	All right.
1854980	1858980	I guess even though, but it's, it's not on the same platform, but whatever I get what
1858980	1859980	you're saying.
1859980	1861780	So, um, so it's tempest 4,000.
1861780	1866480	Well here's, here's the thing, Jamie, here's why I think I'm leaning towards saying spiritual
1866480	1867480	successor.
1867480	1872360	Um, tempest 4,000 may be the first game that I refund on steam.
1872360	1878000	So it, it, it kinda like honestly in, in the position it's in right now, it doesn't deserve
1878000	1880240	to be in the same line as tempest 2000.
1880240	1881880	That's where my brain went.
1881880	1884920	But this is, this is supposed to be one of those games that's going to sell me on the
1884920	1888520	Atari ST or the new platform that they have, right?
1888520	1889720	Here's the thing.
1889720	1894840	It's not that my experiences with the game, I mean the game itself is okay.
1894840	1898640	I mean it doesn't really seem to do anything that much different than tempest 2000.
1898640	1900000	Here's the problem.
1900000	1904960	On PC, I don't know, and some of you have probably heard about this already.
1904960	1910640	The PC version is $10 cheaper than the console versions, which is cool.
1910640	1912320	I mean I'm not going to complain about that.
1912320	1915560	I mean I guess I would if I was more of a console person.
1915560	1919960	But the problem with the PC version is that they didn't do like anything.
1919960	1925440	It's like somebody just hit the switch to dump their comp, you know, dump the program
1925440	1928800	instead of compiling it for Xbox one, compiling for the PC.
1928800	1932560	And what I mean by that is you can't change any of the video options.
1932560	1934840	You can't change any of the keyboard mappings.
1934840	1939040	So either you're going to play with really fucking crazy keyboard mappings or you're
1939040	1940040	stuck.
1940040	1941780	You have to use an Xbox 360 controller.
1941780	1949940	You can't use the mouse, which is redonkulous for a game like tempest, which is not the
1949940	1952000	same thing on a controller.
1952000	1956220	And it just kind of like, it controls funky with the Xbox 360 controller.
1956220	1957960	I just don't like it.
1957960	1962920	So like, I just, I don't know, like honestly I played around in tempest 4000 like finally
1962920	1966360	when I figured out how to like to reboot my whole computer to get it to see the control
1966360	1967360	and all this stuff.
1967360	1969080	And I was just like, mama, this is garbage.
1969080	1974480	Like it's just, it's not what tempest 2000 was to me when it was on the Jaguar.
1974480	1980000	So I'm sorry to be so unkind, but at the same time, this is a half ass fucking port.
1980000	1983840	If I have ever seen one and this franchise deserves better.
1983840	1988280	Hello and welcome to modern day Atari where all of their ports are half ass pieces of
1988280	1989280	shit.
1989280	1995120	Enjoy processing my refund because it sucks because they redid, they redid alone in the
1995120	1997440	dark and it was shit.
1997440	2000960	They redid well tempest and I apparently that shit.
2000960	2006440	And then they, um, I think they ported their, well they're porting their mobile version
2006440	2012440	of um, theme park and that's going to be shit as well.
2012440	2022040	So I'm sorry, but my, my review on tempest 4000 is a pass until they fix the PC version.
2022040	2025040	What the fuck were they thinking putting that out?
2025040	2026040	That was awful.
2026040	2027680	That was a horrible decision.
2027680	2033960	So anyway, that's why I was trying to distance it from tempest 2000, which is an amazing
2033960	2038600	a game that, you know, from years and years ago, but unfortunately just like, you know,
2038600	2042520	you can't, anyway, I could go on and on.
2042520	2047480	Let's talk about something more positive, shall we, uh, a game that I, uh, did not think
2047480	2052640	I would enjoy, although it seems like everybody else I know was really enjoying it.
2052640	2056480	And finally it was one of those things where between all the Twitch streams, all the tweets
2056480	2059760	that kind of like positive buzz and energy was, I had to feed off of it.
2059760	2064640	And I finally, I plunked down the money and bought Octopath traveler, um, on the switch.
2064640	2066920	And I gotta say, I like it.
2066920	2068520	I really, really like it.
2068520	2070960	And it seems that the game is doing very well.
2070960	2075560	Um, I don't know if we have any hard sales numbers yet, but it really, I mean, and this
2075560	2079520	could be just like confirmation bias or whatever, but like I look at my friends list on the
2079520	2082080	switch and it's like, everybody is fucking playing this game.
2082080	2084440	Like, yeah, I haven't bought it yet.
2084440	2088960	This game has to be selling better than Square Enix could have projected, which I think is
2088960	2096420	a great thing because it shows that it's not that everything has to be Sprite retro type
2096420	2101720	of stuff, which I do like the kind of like hybridness of the fact that you are these
2101720	2105760	like old school sprites, but like, you know, it's a lot of like new school looking environments
2105760	2109320	where the water effects are beautiful and a lot of like the, you know, blurring that
2109320	2110720	they do and some of that stuff.
2110720	2112240	It looks really good when it's in motion.
2112240	2113880	I don't think screenshots do it justice.
2113880	2115600	It looks really good in motion.
2115600	2120820	Um, but anyway, my point is, is that, and the fact that the battle system is a very
2120820	2125160	kind of old school, you know, super Nintendo ask RPG battle system.
2125160	2126840	I mean, they do have some new stuff in it.
2126840	2129960	Like, you know, you have the breaking system, which is unique.
2129960	2133080	I don't remember seeing something like that in another game, but like, you know, at some
2133080	2140000	point, like one of the JRPG classics, final fantasy kind of really fell off the path with
2140000	2141000	the battle system.
2141000	2142000	Right.
2142000	2146760	Because, you know, 10 was very kind of standard, but then 12 really changed it.
2146760	2152160	Um, which was, I still, I like 12, I'm not knocking 12, I love 12, but it was very different.
2152160	2159160	13 was really different and I still, I like 13s battle system, but it's not like a classic
2159160	2160160	JRPG at all.
2160240	2166400	And obviously I'm skipping 11 and 14 for obvious reasons, but then 15 was also another like
2166400	2168760	radical change to the battle system.
2168760	2174320	I don't feel as good on what they did with 15 as they did with 12 and 13, but okay.
2174320	2177080	So like, I don't know, like there's, there's part of me that says it's kind of good that
2177080	2184360	like an old school mechanic JRPG is being received this well, because I think it shows
2184360	2186100	that there's still a demand for that.
2186100	2188400	And I think it is going to send Square Enix a message.
2188640	2191720	Um, at least for the people in this country, you know, I don't know how the game is doing
2191720	2195440	in Japan, which is obviously very important as well, uh, to the direction that's going
2195440	2196440	to be taken.
2196440	2202680	But I think it is a sure, sure thing we will see an Octopath Traveler 2 or some type of,
2202680	2205800	you know, I don't know, where do you go from Octopath Traveler?
2205800	2208800	Like nine, what is the prefix for nine?
2208800	2209800	New chrono trigger?
2209800	2210800	Yeah.
2210800	2211800	I don't know.
2211800	2212800	Um, crap.
2212800	2213800	I actually know this.
2214200	2218480	Maybe they'll go, maybe they'll regress and do seven, heptapath, well hepta or septa.
2218480	2219480	Yeah.
2219480	2220480	Septopath.
2220480	2221480	Yeah.
2221480	2222480	What is nine?
2222480	2223480	I don't know.
2223480	2224480	Anyway.
2224480	2233520	Um, a tiger claw in chat says, uh, J D says nono, like a nonogram.
2233520	2236040	If you're using the same, um, Greek prefix.
2236040	2237040	Interesting.
2237040	2238040	Okay.
2238040	2242960	So it'd be, you would go to hepta, octo, enia, deca, if you're all using Greek.
2243120	2244520	So that would be seven, six.
2244520	2246960	Maybe they'll just get, cause I bet people wouldn't recognize the nines, they just go
2246960	2253880	to decapath traveler or they'll just do Octopath Traveler 2 and the local octopuses and Octomom
2253880	2254880	is in it.
2254880	2255880	Ultros is in it.
2255880	2259000	Ultros and, and Octodad is in it.
2259000	2260000	Yes.
2260000	2262320	And um, what other famous octopi are there?
2262320	2266480	Um, that one that still that threw the fish at the guy because it didn't like his dinner.
2266480	2267480	Octodad.
2267480	2268480	I said Octodad.
2268480	2269480	Yeah.
2269480	2270480	Yeah.
2270480	2271480	Octodad.
2271480	2272480	Anyway.
2273000	2274000	Here's my one criticism.
2274000	2280200	My one minor criticism of Octopi, cause obviously I, in all fairness, uh, I've sunk maybe like
2280200	2284880	five hours in the game and I have three characters, you know, like, and you have to go around
2284880	2285880	and collect all eight.
2285880	2287800	It's like, I've got a long way to go.
2287800	2294400	Um, I do feel like the three stories I've played so far, I started with Ophelia, who's
2294400	2296560	like your cleric, your healer.
2296560	2301300	Um, and then I picked up, I just kind of went in a circle cause I went to the nearest people.
2301320	2305180	So I've got Cyrus who's like the scholar, your black mage basically.
2305180	2312260	Uh, and then I just picked up Tressa who is a merchant, but she uses like spears and bows.
2312260	2315660	So she's kind of, I don't know, dragoon-y, I don't know what to call her.
2315660	2319060	Well, maybe more like a ocean merchant.
2319060	2320060	Yeah, actually.
2320060	2321060	Like a pirate.
2321060	2324580	She, again, she uses wind magic, so you're not too off base.
2324580	2325580	That probably, you're probably.
2325580	2326580	I think she's a pirate.
2326580	2327580	She's probably more a pirate.
2327580	2328900	In my heart, I think she's a pirate.
2328900	2329900	Yeah.
2329900	2330900	So anyway.
2330900	2331900	She uses highway robbery.
2331900	2337340	But anyway, the thing about all those stories, I liked them.
2337340	2341540	I thought Ophelia's was a little cliche-y RPG.
2341540	2344880	I was kind of like rolling my eyes, but I really liked the other two.
2344880	2347140	I really, really liked Tressa's.
2347140	2354340	Um, but anyway, uh, I did feel like all of their openings were the same template.
2354340	2358900	What I mean by that is that, you know, you get opening sequence.
2358900	2362140	You get, here is the path action that you're going to learn.
2362140	2363340	Now use it.
2363340	2367620	And then here is, you're going to go down one screen into another screen.
2367620	2370420	And then you're going to go down one more screen into the town.
2370420	2373020	And then right next to the town is the dungeon.
2373020	2375220	And at the end of the dungeon, you will fight the boss.
2375220	2377060	And then once you fight the boss, good job.
2377060	2378460	You can move on to the next one.
2378460	2383020	So I kind of felt like there's a very like template to it all.
2383020	2386580	But I also like, again, it's a minor, it's a minor criticism.
2386580	2390180	I just felt it was a little bit like, okay, I'd like to be maybe like surprised.
2390180	2394220	I can imagine that if you're doing a game where the whole kitsch is, you get to start
2394220	2399200	with any of the eight and do them in any order, then there has to be some sort of balance
2399200	2400200	between them all.
2400200	2401740	So I'm giving the game a pass.
2401740	2408140	I imagine the more fun and the less like copy pasty type of things will be when you have
2408140	2412000	your entire party and you start to move into the chapter two stuff so the game can start
2412000	2414500	to do different things because they'll know you have all eight characters.
2414540	2416660	It sounds very much like Seiken Densetsu though.
2416660	2418140	Seiken Densetsu 3.
2418140	2419140	Yes.
2419140	2422300	Where you start off with the different characters and the different paths.
2422300	2424060	Or Saga, which a lot of people are compared to.
2424060	2425780	But I didn't, I didn't like Saga.
2425780	2426940	I didn't like the battle system.
2426940	2427940	I didn't like...
2427940	2428940	I'm not a big Saga fan.
2428940	2429940	Yeah.
2429940	2434340	And honestly, it's what, when people compared Octopath to Saga, I was instantly like, had
2434340	2435340	that, I don't know.
2435340	2439340	You know what my thought is that I would like Octopath for the same reason I like Duprism
2439340	2441900	or what do we have, Threads of Fate over here.
2442580	2444860	Well, because you start, you have two paths.
2444860	2448620	You start off with each character and then eventually they, their stories merge.
2448620	2449620	So.
2449620	2450620	Um, let's see.
2450620	2455460	Uh, Ragenator in chat asks, Cyrus, like Billy Ray or Miley?
2455460	2456460	Clearly Miley.
2456460	2457460	Clearly.
2457460	2459060	I mean, Dolly Parton is her godmother.
2459060	2460060	Hello.
2460060	2461060	I know.
2461060	2462060	She came in like a wrecking ball.
2462060	2463340	Although Cyrus in this story is male.
2463340	2464340	But whatever.
2464340	2465340	All right.
2465340	2466340	Anyway.
2466340	2469500	Uh, Dartetsuya says, I was just thinking it sounds like Seiken Densetsu 3.
2469500	2470500	Yeah.
2470500	2472260	The layout kind of, kind of.
2472260	2473260	Anyway.
2473260	2475780	Um, so yeah, that's, that game's been taking up a lot of my time as well.
2475780	2479820	So otherwise I'm still playing Heroes of the Storm, Final Fantasy 14.
2479820	2486100	Um, if for those that play Final Fantasy 14, my, my Eureka, I just got my plus one weapon
2486100	2490900	in Eureka and I'm up to level 18 in the Eureka thing for all you three people that also are
2490900	2492300	playing Final Fantasy 14 out there.
2492300	2494060	But I'm having fun with that.
2494060	2495120	So there you go.
2495120	2496900	That's my kind of busy gaming week.
2496900	2500400	Sadly, I have to admit, I still have not been able to go through the motions of setting
2500400	2501560	up the VR and all that stuff.
2501560	2503680	I wanted to do it last week, but then I got sick.
2503680	2505780	Well, here's where I'm running into a problem.
2505780	2509280	This space in there where I have the PS4, it's kind of hard to like set up the camera.
2509280	2513980	I kind of don't have enough space, so I kind of have to do it out here, which means I got
2513980	2516920	to move everything out here and then I can't really stream it unless I do the native streaming
2516920	2518520	through the PS4.
2518520	2525240	But I mean, obviously as soon as we have a date for Tetris Effect, this will all be fast
2525240	2526240	tracked.
2526240	2527240	I think it's October.
2527240	2528240	Yeah.
2528240	2529240	It's, it's, it'll be here before we know it.
2529240	2530240	Almost August.
2530240	2531240	Right.
2531240	2535620	And then August means, Oh my God, Dragon cons in four weeks, which means by I'll be gone
2535620	2536620	for a week.
2536620	2538260	And then after that, I'll be like, Oh my God, it's September.
2538260	2541300	And it's like, you know, time moves so fast.
2541300	2542300	My God.
2542300	2545300	Anyway, it's like, Hey, here's fourth quarter games.
2545300	2546300	Yeah.
2546300	2547300	Right.
2547300	2549780	And then a new Smash Brothers and Nintendo online and everything's here.
2549780	2553460	So isn't that, that's until December, isn't it?
2553460	2555660	Uh, yeah, they gave the date for that.
2555660	2556660	It's it's December.
2556660	2557660	Yes.
2557660	2560480	I mean, it's past the November rush, but I remember is a Pokemon.
2560480	2561480	Yeah.
2561480	2567680	Well, I also, I kind of feel like thanks to the age of digital distribution in part, uh,
2567680	2571720	the day at having your game out by black Friday, isn't what it used to be.
2571720	2572720	No.
2572720	2573720	You know what I mean?
2573720	2576220	I've been buying digitally anyways for everything.
2576220	2580680	So the holiday time period, isn't what it used to be, you know, and the same thing has
2580680	2582300	been happening to movies.
2582300	2587960	You know, the two big times to release movies are the summer and the holidays.
2587960	2588960	Right.
2588960	2589960	Which is still mostly true.
2589960	2593440	Like a lot of movies make a lot of big money in those timeframes, but like, I think in
2593440	2597380	the past, you know, five or so years, you've really seen where like, you know what movies
2597380	2602560	can come out in February, March, you know, they can come out in October and still make
2602560	2603560	a ton of money.
2603560	2604560	You know what I mean?
2604560	2605560	Mm hmm.
2605560	2607680	Um, like Deadpool was like a February movie, right?
2607680	2608680	No, it was March.
2608680	2609680	Well, the original Deadpool.
2609680	2610680	Yeah.
2610680	2611680	Original Deadpool was on Valentine's day.
2611680	2612680	Right.
2612680	2613680	And then the new one was in March.
2613680	2615420	So they were, and they both made shit, tons of money.
2615420	2616420	So, you know, because they were great.
2616420	2617420	Yeah, exactly.
2617420	2622620	It's like, you know, people will go to the cinema to see a movie, you know, last movie
2622620	2623980	I saw was Deadpool two.
2623980	2624980	Yeah.
2624980	2629820	Which God, the last movie I saw was probably whatever art movie you and I saw earlier this
2629820	2630820	year.
2630820	2636140	Either like, no, we didn't see, I thought you were going to go see a, the second mama
2636140	2637140	mia movie.
2637140	2639980	I had, nobody would see it with me on Friday night.
2640000	2643640	I haven't seen the first one, but I'll go see it with you as long as I'm at home by
2643640	2644640	10.
2644640	2645640	Oh, I've seen it next Saturday.
2645640	2646640	We'll figure it out.
2646640	2650960	Well then the other thing is, and I was going to say is that my friend in the Bay area,
2650960	2654200	Melody who had the baby recently, I still haven't been able to visit the baby cause
2654200	2658560	Melody's had all her, yeah, well, Melody's had, she, she, I don't want to get in all
2658560	2662520	her business on the, she's been sick so, but she's fine now.
2662520	2665040	So I'm going to go visit her and see the baby.
2665040	2668200	And then she said, fuck yeah, we're going to go see the mama mia thing.
2668220	2670940	So I knew I'd get to go see it in like two weeks, but I've got to get past this clue
2670940	2674900	thing first, which admittedly is my own fault for being involved with that.
2674900	2675900	So anyway.
2675900	2676900	Okay.
2676900	2677900	But it's fun.
2677900	2678900	It's fun.
2678900	2679900	It's so fun.
2679900	2680900	The picture came out.
2680900	2683300	I don't know if you saw the picture of me as Mrs. Peacock, but it's out there now.
2683300	2684780	So I'm very proud.
2684780	2685780	Thank you.
2685780	2686780	Thank you.
2686780	2688140	I am having a lot of fun with it.
2688140	2689140	It's good.
2689140	2692100	So anyway, that's some good drag.
2692100	2697420	So I, I man, I feel like a woman, but I'll tell you this, you know, you have to do the
2697420	2698920	Ms. Cracker thing.
2698920	2700720	She's a woman.
2700720	2701720	I did.
2701720	2705080	When I saw, when I saw myself in the mirror the first time after all the makeup was done,
2705080	2710000	I did do the whole mother, I am gorgeous from drag race.
2710000	2712240	So it was fun.
2712240	2719080	But I will say being a woman is hard fucking work because the core set fucking hurts.
2719080	2724240	Like all my insides are basically being shoved into every other part of my body.
2724240	2725240	Right.
2725240	2726240	Okay.
2726240	2730420	But I was never one to like disrespect femininity women go through.
2730420	2735500	I'm letting y'all know, yo, I'm still giving you a shit eating grin.
2735500	2736660	Listen here, man.
2736660	2740860	Real men try on a core set sometime and try what those ladies go.
2740860	2742860	And I would, I don't just mean like put on the core set.
2742860	2750300	I mean, let her lace it and Oh my God, you will have a new found respect for what women
2750300	2751300	go through.
2751300	2754040	Because I got to get them hip somehow.
2754040	2758760	And the course that does that, I'm not going to pad because the dress doesn't like Mrs.
2758760	2763800	Peacock's dress is too fifties conservative to really show the padding and which means
2763800	2765880	I don't have to tuck the boys away either.
2765880	2768560	So I don't have to go like, I hope you have a good crinoline though.
2768560	2769560	I we're good.
2769560	2770560	We're good.
2770560	2771560	Okay.
2771560	2772560	Um, but then what was I gonna say?
2772560	2773560	Um, dang it.
2773560	2775400	Oh, the shoes.
2775400	2776860	Jesus Christ.
2776860	2778360	And I've done heels before.
2778360	2779360	Thanks to Rocky horror.
2779360	2780360	Okay.
2780420	2783020	These are like little heels, but these are like straight up.
2783020	2786580	Fuck me pumps that I'm wearing and they, they hurt my fucking leg.
2786580	2789620	Like I will be impressed if I get through that show.
2789620	2791420	Tape your first two toes together.
2791420	2794980	Oh, like I'm on my feet on your feet.
2794980	2795980	It will help.
2795980	2796980	Okay.
2796980	2797980	Good to know.
2797980	2798980	Why?
2798980	2799980	Why not?
2799980	2800980	Everything else.
2800980	2801980	My body is all laced up.
2801980	2802980	Plus, plus, plus, plus, plus.
2802980	2808580	You can get the, uh, ball of your heel pads that don't get the Dr. Scholl's one.
2808580	2811520	Get the CVS one because they're cheaper and they do just a good job.
2811520	2812520	Good to know.
2812520	2813520	Trust me.
2813520	2816240	JD in chat says, did you choose a drag name?
2816240	2821520	Um, at the end of the day, I decided to do the Chad Michaels thing and just do Rob Roberts
2821520	2823840	so that I don't, well, I didn't want to split my branding.
2823840	2824840	Does that make sense?
2824840	2826840	I didn't want it.
2826840	2830240	And it's, it's part the Willem thing too.
2830240	2832320	Is it except you're not an asshole?
2832320	2833320	Well I try.
2833940	2840220	But is that if this is really, really well received and it's like, Hey Rob, we want to
2840220	2843820	give you a paid gig, but you should do it in a dress cause it would be funny.
2843820	2846060	Then it's like, I have no, I'll do the Eddie Izzard thing.
2846060	2847780	I have no, no problem with it.
2847780	2848780	Whatever.
2848780	2849780	It is what it is.
2849780	2850780	Gender is a construct.
2850780	2851780	Tear it apart.
2851780	2857620	Uh, actually I know, um, a local queen comedian I could put you in contact with.
2857620	2858620	So okay.
2858620	2859620	If you were interested.
2859620	2860620	You never know.
2860620	2861620	You never know.
2861620	2864600	Rob Roberts says, I have laced many a cosplayer in a corset.
2864600	2870780	I legit understand, but Rama, until you've been in that corset, which you don't have
2870780	2874560	to say in chat if you have or not, I'm just saying, until you've been in that corset,
2874560	2876480	you don't really know.
2876480	2877480	Just say it.
2877480	2878480	That's it.
2878480	2881840	I want to see Ron Chan do bust out some Akane cosplay.
2881840	2882840	All right.
2882840	2886760	Saying like sexy cross play Luigi.
2886760	2891440	If I would do that, if that's what makes them happy, then sure.
2891440	2892720	All right.
2892720	2896260	But in the meantime, there's so many people out there probably listening going, I thought
2896260	2898500	this was a video game podcast.
2898500	2905820	It is, but sometimes you play video games and corset and heels and that's fine.
2905820	2906820	You know what?
2906820	2907820	I've decided.
2907820	2908820	What?
2908820	2909820	I'm going to do girl Mario.
2909820	2910820	Maria.
2910820	2911820	Maria?
2911820	2912820	For what?
2912820	2913820	Maria.
2913820	2914820	Like a-
2914820	2915820	For maybe Saconomy.
2915820	2918500	Mag West is coming up, but man, it's on a, it's on a busy fucking weekend.
2918500	2919500	Mag West.
2919560	2925320	I got shit going on, but I've been wanting to do Sacanime and I'm going to try to remake
2925320	2930360	my Grey Warden, but actually I'm redoing my Jill Valentine.
2930360	2935220	You remember my very, very first cosplay that I did out here was my Jill costume.
2935220	2940900	I am going to remake my Jill Valentine costume now that I am probably a good four sizes smaller
2940900	2945200	than when I did it last time, which by the way, today marks a hundred pounds down.
2945200	2946200	Really?
2946200	2949360	All you have to do now is find two giant slices of bread.
2949360	2951640	Do you want me to die?
2951640	2953360	I ate pizza the other day.
2953360	2955680	No, to be a Jill sandwich.
2955680	2956680	Right.
2956680	2960240	All right.
2960240	2965400	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
2965400	2968080	use the passphrase, fun.
2968080	2970840	Let's get into some video game news.
2970840	2973160	Believe it or not, we have some around here.
2973160	2977080	Starting off with a game that's kind of a pleasant surprise to see back in the news,
2977080	2978080	right?
2978080	2979080	Exactly.
2979080	2981920	Like it's about time that the game came out that I bought.
2981920	2983120	Was it two years ago?
2983120	2984120	One year ago?
2984120	2992600	I can't remember when this came out originally, but No Man's Sky Next is getting its due time.
2992600	2995040	I guess they're releasing it now.
2995040	2996820	It's going to be coming to the Xbox.
2996820	3000400	And what does No Man's Sky Next add to the game?
3000400	3002300	Well, true multiplayer.
3002300	3007660	So not this like, oh, hey, I'm in the same place as you are, or I see a glowing thing
3007660	3008860	or something like that.
3008860	3013380	No, you actually will see the actual people that you're playing with.
3013380	3020180	So they're going to have third person options, true multiplayer, ringed planets.
3020180	3022420	Also there's going to be a visual overhaul.
3022420	3027980	You can build bases on any planet and you'll be able to assemble and upgrade a fleet of
3027980	3032620	frigates and command them from the bridge of your freighter.
3032620	3034020	So that's pretty awesome.
3034020	3041580	So that'll be coming out, of course, on PlayStation 4 and PC on July 24th and will be releasing
3041580	3044740	on Xbox One, which includes everything.
3044740	3046060	So hurry.
3046060	3047140	I can't wait to try it.
3047140	3051580	And if you already own the game, which many of you do, this is going to be just a free
3051580	3053500	free update, free update.
3053500	3056820	Just like they've done several big updates.
3056820	3057820	It's crazy.
3057820	3060500	I haven't played it since they did any of those updates.
3060500	3065560	So I'm very looking forward to going back to play super update and it's going to look
3065560	3067860	awesome because 4K TV.
3067860	3068860	Yeah.
3068860	3070460	So I'm looking forward to that.
3070460	3071460	Nice.
3071460	3072460	Yeah.
3072460	3073460	I'm, I'm excited to check this out again.
3073460	3078180	You know, I, I did check it out not a terribly long time ago, probably after their last big
3078180	3082680	update, but I'm, you know, I'm excited for a chance to go back and revisit this game.
3082680	3087320	I do love that they, you know, have done this as a free, you know, update.
3087320	3091440	I'm not sure where the money's coming from to have sustained that studio for two years.
3091440	3095880	I guess the game is selling well enough, even in a lot of the markdown prices or when it
3095880	3101040	first came out or what have you, um, that they had enough money to kind of pour back
3101040	3105680	maybe additional sales on PC and now on Xbox One, I mean, that's a whole new audience.
3105680	3109680	So I guess, but you know, most studios would have, you know, taken the money imported into
3109680	3110680	a new project.
3110680	3116100	So it's pretty cool that they've, you know, kind of committed themselves to making a more
3116100	3117720	fully realized game.
3117720	3119080	Well, here's the thing.
3119080	3121160	I never hated the game to begin with.
3121160	3127240	Like it wasn't a 10 out of 10 to me, but I didn't allow myself to buy into all that hype.
3127240	3128240	And you know that.
3128240	3129240	Right.
3129240	3130240	Yeah.
3130240	3131520	Cause it was all about like, Oh, let's get to the center of the universe and you get
3131520	3136480	to the center of the universe and it's like, Oh, and there's nothing there.
3136480	3138960	Well, but here's, here's the thing.
3138960	3142540	You know, that there was all that lead up with all this and I was sitting here saying,
3142540	3143540	so where's the game?
3143540	3144540	Where's the fucking game?
3144540	3145540	You know what?
3145540	3147140	I don't care anymore until they show us the game.
3147140	3151420	So you know, by the time the game finally came out, I feel like since I didn't really
3151420	3159200	have expectations, I enjoyed it for what it was, which for me was more of like a Zen Minecraft
3159200	3160960	type of experience.
3160960	3165340	You know, and I think a lot of people made this narrative based on, you know, what the
3165340	3168600	developers were saying at the time and putting out there in the media, which they've certainly
3168600	3171860	learned their lessons since then was they were looking for probably more like an action
3171860	3175200	space game, which I never was expecting ever.
3175200	3179440	I liked the Zen Minecraft part of it, but there just wasn't a lot to do on any of the
3179440	3180440	planets originally.
3180440	3185800	And, and if you wanted to just sit there and mine a plan and build stuff or whatever, well,
3185800	3190420	then you have to fend off all the robot centuries that don't like you mining the planet, even
3190420	3194740	if you go to a peaceful planet or it's like, Oh, Hey, look at all this inventory shuffling
3194740	3195740	I have to do.
3195740	3201220	And that was fixed several updates ago, but you know, I'm talking about when I first played
3201220	3206460	it and my last memory of it, which was like, Oh, well I can't stack any of this stuff and
3206460	3212060	Oh, my ship's out of fuel now and better go mine some fuel and I don't go to this other
3212060	3213060	planet.
3213060	3215180	Oh, look, it's the same shit.
3215180	3219140	So I'm excited to try it again and I'm curious to see how the multiplayer component works
3219140	3220140	out.
3220140	3225040	Like, I'm not really going to go seeking out other people, but I'm curious, like if somebody's
3225040	3228480	on the same planet as you, is it going to come up on like your radar?
3228480	3234360	Like there's another player like on this planet, but you know, again, it's an entire fucking
3234360	3235360	planet.
3235360	3239360	So like, just because somebody is on that planet, they could be, you know, so far away
3239360	3240360	from you.
3240360	3241360	Yeah.
3241360	3242360	If there's like billions of planets.
3242360	3243360	Yeah.
3243360	3244360	I know it's going to be interesting to see how that all works.
3244360	3246720	So, uh, I'll be, I'll be revisiting the game again.
3246720	3247720	I know I will.
3247720	3248720	So, uh, very cool.
3248720	3249720	What about you?
3249720	3250720	You know, you can pick up the wind sky again.
3250720	3251720	Play that.
3251720	3252720	Oh, yeah.
3252720	3253720	I'll try it.
3253720	3254720	If I ever get the TV again.
3255400	3257120	I was hoping that they do like a VR mode for it.
3257120	3259320	You know, maybe that would be cool.
3259320	3260320	Maybe.
3260320	3263880	Uh, as she went under Matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I really wanted
3263880	3267960	the game to be like the spaceship parts of the book version of ready player one.
3267960	3272960	Uh, cause you don't chat says devs don't like to abandon their games these days.
3272960	3273960	That's part of the problem.
3273960	3277760	I miss the good old days when a dev would just run off and leave the game open for mods
3277760	3278760	to have fun with.
3278760	3279760	Oh, don't worry.
3279760	3280920	There's plenty of companies out there.
3280920	3282000	They'll abandon their games.
3282000	3283000	No problem.
3283000	3284320	So that's, there's not an issue.
3284920	3285920	There's plenty of games.
3285920	3291560	Uh, EA would like to, uh, woo you to download origin cause you don't, um, but, uh, I mean,
3291560	3296840	I kinda like, I kinda get what you're saying, but at the same time, this isn't the first
3296840	3300280	time that we've seen developers stick with a game they really believe in either.
3300280	3305040	Like I think Diablo three is probably the biggest example of a game that they did turn
3305040	3307240	around a couple of years after release.
3307240	3311120	You know, Diablo three now is not anything like it was when it first released.
3311120	3312800	And uh, it's, it's a lot of fun to play now.
3312800	3316720	I still play Diablo three here and there, but when that game first released, it was,
3316720	3317720	it was sloppy.
3317720	3321560	Uh, which for a big series like Diablo was a really ugly thing.
3321560	3325160	So do you think Diablo four this year at Blizzcon or?
3325160	3332280	I want to believe just like another expansion, like, like, like an X files poster, but with,
3332280	3338640	you know, a demon hunter instead of a UFO, I want to believe, um, but I, no, I don't
3338640	3340320	think it'll be another expansion.
3340360	3344280	It would be weird at this point to have another expansion when the necromancer wasn't really
3344280	3345280	an expansion.
3345280	3349160	I know they call it the necromancer expansion, but it wasn't, it wasn't a real expansion.
3349160	3350160	You know what I mean?
3350160	3354000	I think Diablo three, it's time to close the book on it and go to Diablo four, whether
3354000	3359680	it's this year, the announced, maybe I want to believe, okay, but the game won't be out
3359680	3360680	this year.
3360680	3361680	So it won't matter.
3361680	3362680	They can announce it this year.
3362680	3366280	It won't actually come out till 2020 probably it'll be on the next stage of consoles.
3366280	3367280	We'll see.
3367680	3370600	And then of course Final Fantasy 14 was another game they really turned around, but like,
3370600	3375200	I feel like the Final Fantasy 14 that's out now, like wasn't even the same game that was
3375200	3376200	originally released.
3376200	3377800	Still waiting for 11 on mobile.
3377800	3382480	But the interesting thing about 14's original release, like No Man's Sky, they continued
3382480	3387600	to patch the shit out of that original Final Fantasy 14 until they finally were ready to
3387600	3392480	pull the plug on it and begin the makeover for Realm Reborn, which caused the game to
3392480	3395640	be down for like, I don't know, it was like eight weeks or something when they, before
3395680	3400440	they launched Realm Reborn, which, you know, was, is now I think the best MMO out there
3400440	3405060	right now is, is 14 or hell let's just, let's upgrade 11 with better graphics.
3405060	3408880	Just keep it all the same since it's going to be on mobile platforms anyways and bring
3408880	3409880	it to switch.
3409880	3415280	Uh, one more comment here on No Man's Sky Dungeon Buster says, once you get settled
3415280	3420720	into a routine of mining, resupplying, flying repeat, it got really boring, but the huge
3420720	3423840	content patches have added a lot more since then.
3424600	3429360	Some other comments on patching, Dungeon Buster says they're still adding free content to
3429360	3430960	Monster Hunter World too.
3430960	3431960	Same with The Division.
3431960	3432960	Yeah, that's always.
3432960	3437160	Well, I mean, we have a story later on, I think about Mario Kart 8, you know, a lot
3437160	3439880	of games are getting like patching updates, which is pretty cool.
3439880	3445200	S21 Hunter Matt suggesting how to change your 4K TV monopolization problems.
3445200	3447880	Loki needs a gamer cave with his own TV.
3447880	3451440	Okay, let me just add on to the house because you get the garage.
3451440	3452440	Well, here's what's going to happen.
3453040	3458440	Well, I already do have the hot ass fucking garage to work out in and play DDR in.
3458440	3462440	It's 110 degrees in there when I'm playing DDR.
3462440	3463440	Let's just put it this way.
3463440	3465640	I'm soaking wet.
3465640	3470640	Like I have to literally, I can't wear a shirt on and it's just soaking wet, which is gross,
3470640	3471640	but it works.
3471640	3473080	Here's what's going to actually happens.
3473080	3476640	Our old TV is going in our bedroom and our old TV still has all the streaming stuff on
3476640	3482080	it so we can, she can watch it on there because she even discovered the other day because
3482120	3489440	she's been using Prime Video and Prime Video kind of sucks, but, you know, Prime Video
3489440	3494120	have to either go through our new TV or my PlayStation 4 and because it wasn't on the
3494120	3498760	other app, but she found that the house is on the NBC app, which is weird because I thought
3498760	3499760	it was on Fox.
3499760	3502920	I'm not sure why it's on NBC, but it's on NBC now.
3502920	3505600	So she's like, oh, they're all the episodes are right here too.
3505600	3507520	I guess I don't need to go through the Prime app anymore.
3507520	3508520	I'm like, uh-huh.
3508520	3509520	Get off the TV.
3510520	3513520	So I will eventually get a TV back.
3513520	3518840	All I have to do is ask too, but I, I've been mainly trying to focus on actually doing programming
3518840	3524640	and stuff and building something because I know everybody wants me to and I, you know,
3524640	3525840	I'll get around to it.
3525840	3530440	If I really want to play No Man's Sky, like if that was like, I was dying to do it, I'd
3530440	3534040	just download it on a PC and play it on my PC.
3534040	3535040	All right.
3535560	3539600	Well, speaking of, uh, Mario Kart, uh, I know this was, uh, something that was going around
3539600	3540600	this week.
3540600	3545440	I think this is because of, uh, Comic-Con, but there are some Mario Kart Hot Wheels that
3545440	3546680	are going to be coming.
3546680	3552720	So didn't we get like, uh, we had like Atari influenced Hot Wheels was the thing.
3552720	3556840	Well, they have Mario flavored Hot Wheels right now.
3556840	3561240	In fact, I actually saw some at GameStop when we were just stopping by there today, but
3561240	3565320	they're like, these are, they're like, you know, Mario paint jobs on like regular car.
3565320	3569960	Oh no, these are full on, like the carts with the characters in them.
3569960	3573560	These are like full on, uh, actual like car racers.
3573560	3575920	Anyway, uh, Mattel partner with Nintendo to do this.
3575920	3576920	They are licensed toys.
3576920	3578560	They're going to be out in 2019.
3578560	3582560	Uh, they were viewable at San Diego Comic-Con, which was probably like the big thing that
3582560	3583560	was going on this weekend.
3583560	3587680	Uh, unfortunately I don't think everybody's getting a release cause there's a lot of characters
3587680	3592240	in Mario Kart, but you will be able to get Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Wario, Rosalina,
3592240	3593820	Toad, and Yoshi.
3593820	3597920	Hot Wheels are also going to be making tracks inspired by various Mario Kart courses.
3597920	3604160	The cars will be $5, uh, each coming out June of 2019.
3604160	3609440	So expensive, cheaper than an amiibo.
3609440	3610440	I don't know.
3610440	3611440	I, I'm still tempted.
3611440	3612440	I think they look really cool.
3612440	3613920	You think, I think your kids would be into these.
3613920	3614920	Wouldn't they?
3614920	3615920	Oh yeah.
3615920	3617280	They always like beg me for Hot Wheels.
3617280	3620400	We have a whole bucket of Hot Wheels that they don't play with.
3620400	3621400	They're not Mario.
3621400	3626440	Well, we have like Hot Wheels, like, okay, so like when I was playing, I used to play
3626440	3627440	with Hot Wheels all the time.
3627440	3632160	I used to have miles of that like orange track that actually is my dad's track.
3632160	3635900	Uh, when he had, when he was a kid, just to tell you how old that stuff is.
3635900	3640680	So like we would play with that and actually build our own courses.
3640680	3643400	But now when you buy the track, first off, it's fucking expensive.
3643400	3646700	And second, all of the like track that you can buy is in a set.
3646700	3651520	Always does something weird and funky and it's just like, you can't loop it with the
3651520	3652520	rest of it.
3652520	3655680	It's like we have one right now that like it goes in like a figure eight really fast
3655680	3659480	and then they crashed into each other and it's really boring, but it's also fucking
3659480	3662940	loud and takes up a ton of fucking space.
3662940	3664320	So that's why we don't play with it.
3664320	3668340	Uh, cause you do in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, will there be shortages?
3668340	3669920	And then we have to find them on eBay.
3669920	3672160	Um, Hot Wheels, no, this is Mattel.
3672960	3674600	They fucking know how to manufacture shit.
3674600	3677240	This isn't Nintendo manufacturing this.
3677240	3678240	There'll be no problems.
3678240	3682440	Well, but are they going to be able to, I mean, what's the demand going to be like and
3682440	3684560	will they be able to anticipate that demand?
3684560	3687080	I mean, I don't really know.
3687080	3692640	I don't normally seek out specific Hot Wheels, so I'm not really sure, but I would imagine
3692640	3697880	that Mattel's got the manufacturing thing down and they'll, they'll play this fake shortage
3697880	3698880	bullshit.
3698880	3699880	All right.
3700040	3703680	Some other comments on, uh, the, uh, desirability in our chat.
3703680	3708000	So maybe Mattel better get ready with a lot of these cause Rama says, I legit want them.
3708000	3710520	Uh, Dartetsuya says, I thought those were neat.
3710520	3714340	Definitely spoke to my inner child and me and now lol used to collect die cast cars
3714340	3715340	like you wouldn't believe.
3715340	3719800	I do want the toad cart and our buddy captain spike from game buoy.org.
3719800	3720800	Hello.
3720800	3726120	Says simply want in all caps and that's a, we actually do collect Hot Wheels.
3726120	3727120	Do you?
3727240	3731760	We collect all the Mustangs and all the Fiat's on a scale of one to want.
3731760	3734240	How do you feel about the, uh, Mario Kart Hot Wheels?
3734240	3740040	I'm actually kind of indifferent just because, um, we're not like as big on it as we used
3740040	3741040	to be.
3741040	3745440	Um, it'd be nice to have, but I mean the last things that, you know, I'll pick up Deanna
3745440	3749840	Mustang every so often, you know, cause he loves his Mustangs and I'll pick up a Fiat
3749840	3752400	when I find it, but I don't know.
3752400	3756120	It just seems like it'd be more stuff that would take up more space in my already overrun
3756120	3757560	toy house.
3757560	3761840	There's a part of me that wants to get at least one or two just to see if Mr. Smoosh
3761840	3763920	will chase it around the house.
3763920	3764920	Okay.
3764920	3765920	Story time.
3765920	3766920	Okay.
3766920	3775040	Dan used to love chasing Shermy around the house with our RC, um, uh, initial D cars.
3775040	3779280	You remember those ones that used to sell at all the anime conventions and then we had
3779280	3785600	also a RC Coro Q cars and we would chase Shermy around with them until she realized stairs.
3786600	3790680	And that's my story about Shermy, rest in peace.
3790680	3791680	All right.
3791680	3792680	Um, well Jamie, why you got the mic?
3792680	3795000	Why don't we move on to the next story?
3795000	3799720	Whale speaking of some Nintendo, you know, they were going to do a game.
3799720	3805000	Well, it was canceled eight years ago, but it would have been the last Tingle thing to
3805000	3809580	release and it was going to be a scary game.
3809580	3816620	And it was supposed to be where Tingle goes into a wizard of Oz esque storybook and he
3816620	3821780	has to dance with the realms princess to escape.
3821780	3825700	First of all, Tingle is scary all on his own.
3825700	3831820	They were working with a van pool and this is according to the producer, uh, Tana Bekinski,
3831820	3834660	um, who gave this out.
3834660	3837220	So, um, weird.
3837220	3839940	Um, I don't, I don't know.
3839940	3844420	I mean, they did a Tingle game that came out with, um, what was it?
3844420	3849320	Four swords, Avengers that came out in Japan with, with it, um, that we never saw the light
3849320	3855740	of day over here officially, um, four swords, Avengers.
3855740	3856740	Yeah.
3856740	3857740	They have four swords game.
3857740	3858740	It was a free download.
3858740	3861060	It was the Tetris game.
3861060	3862260	I don't know.
3862260	3864460	Maybe it was the Tetra game that didn't come with it.
3864460	3865460	Nevermind.
3865460	3870580	But, um, but anyway, uh, we have no Tingle, scary, weird game.
3870580	3872300	Well, that's disappointing.
3872300	3874300	Would you have played a Silent Hill starring Tingle?
3874300	3877220	It doesn't seem like it'd be very Silent Hill.
3877220	3879300	It just seemed like it would just be weird.
3879300	3882300	Uh, going to chat at live.vognetwork.com.
3882300	3883300	Silent Mushroom Kingdom.
3883300	3885900	S2100 Matt says Tingle murder party.
3885900	3888020	Wait, it would be Silent Hyrule.
3888020	3891260	Uh, JD says any game starring Tingle is a horror game.
3891260	3896060	Speaking of horror games, I found, I have some of the Burger King games still, oh, like
3896060	3897060	sneak King.
3897060	3898060	I don't have sneaking.
3898060	3901980	I have the motor cycle racing game, which I don't know why I don't have sneak King.
3901980	3903500	Cause I would have totally kept that.
3903500	3909060	So I don't know where that is, but I have the, the motor, the mini bike racing one.
3909060	3912060	Are those backwards compatible on Xbox one and the whole thing?
3912060	3914660	Um, well the, their expert, I don't know if they're backwards compatible.
3914660	3919060	I know they, their Xbox, the original Xbox and the mini bike racing one.
3919060	3924260	Their Xbox, the original Xbox and Xbox 360 on one disc, which is kind of unique.
3924260	3925260	Oh yeah.
3925260	3926260	That's right.
3926260	3927260	I forgot they were original Xbox.
3927260	3928260	Yeah.
3928260	3929260	Yeah.
3929260	3930260	Yeah.
3930260	3931260	Interesting.
3931260	3934300	By the way, there's something else that I remembered about figures and toys that are,
3934300	3939020	they announced at, uh, comic con golden girls action figures, Rob.
3939020	3940020	Oh yeah.
3940020	3943460	There, there's like golden girls, nostalgia is at an all time high.
3943460	3948380	I've been getting links on my wall about like Pez dispensers and like, like every, you used
3948380	3950140	to have quite the Pez dispenser collection.
3950140	3951340	I did back in the day.
3951340	3952340	They're all kind of in a drawer now.
3952340	3957460	I don't really have them on display or anymore, but um, yeah, uh, I mean, here's the thing.
3957460	3958460	I love the golden girls.
3958460	3962620	It will always be one of my favorite shows ever, but like I'm finding with all these,
3962620	3966180	um, all these things that they have, I'm starting to hit my limit.
3966180	3967180	You know what I mean?
3967180	3969300	Like I, I don't need every single fucking golden girl.
3969300	3970500	You know what's next, right?
3970500	3971500	What?
3971500	3972500	Designing women.
3972500	3973500	Yeah.
3973500	3976740	I know justice for, hashtag justice for designing women.
3976740	3978420	We're going to have the Delta Burke pop.
3978420	3984020	It is an underappreciated like, you know, eighties slash nineties, uh, classic.
3984020	3985020	Yeah.
3985020	3989980	We need like a Delta Burke and uh, um, God, what was her name that the play Julia Sugar
3989980	3993300	Baker, like the, the lead in that show, I don't remember her name.
3993300	3996780	Not Delta Burke cause they wrote her out and it was the Charlene character.
3996780	3998860	That show was good.
3998860	4001140	It was, that's what I found with like my, my new TV.
4001140	4004860	They have this thing called the Roku channel cause it has a built in Roku inside of it
4004860	4009780	and the Roku channel, for those who are not aware, has a bunch of old shit that you would
4009780	4012600	just never think that somebody would license.
4012600	4017820	So it has like old TV and old movies, really weird, random shit that's on there.
4017820	4023860	For example, it has, see, it has the complete series of Elf or it has,
4023860	4025940	Elf had a really weird ending.
4025940	4033260	Or it has, um, the complete series of Grace Under Fire or, uh, what was the other weird
4033260	4036580	show that was on there that was, I was like, well, that's odd.
4036580	4039060	Has short circuit too, but not the first short circuit.
4039060	4040060	Sorry.
4040060	4041060	Important interruption.
4041060	4042060	Dixie Carter.
4042060	4043260	Why couldn't I fucking remember that?
4043260	4044260	Dixie Carter.
4044260	4045260	Okay, sorry.
4045260	4046260	Yeah.
4046260	4048220	So like a bunch of weird stuff that I went through and go, I'm going to make my kids
4048220	4054620	watch this and they're going to hate me for it, but I don't care because it's Elf.
4054620	4057140	Elf is pretty cool except the part where he tries to eat cats.
4057140	4058780	I don't like that.
4058780	4061780	I don't like that, but he never did actually get to eat a cat.
4061780	4063540	So I think that's, that's good.
4063540	4068180	Apparently the people who were on that show hated being on it because of all the holes
4068180	4070300	that they had to do the puppet through.
4070300	4071300	Oh, Alf.
4071300	4072300	Yeah.
4072300	4073300	Oh God.
4073300	4074300	I can only imagine.
4074300	4075300	Yeah.
4075300	4076300	But the ending was such a downer.
4076300	4077700	Oh gosh.
4077700	4078700	I watched it live.
4078700	4080420	I'm like, I was scarred for life.
4080420	4084980	Captain Spike is asking what service was this?
4084980	4086580	It's just the, it's Roku.
4086580	4091020	And so Roku has their own channel called the Roku channel and it has a bunch of free stuff.
4091260	4094140	I think it's all like sponsored by Geico or something like that.
4094140	4095620	It's just random shit.
4095620	4100300	Like they have all sorts of random movies on there and random TV shows.
4100300	4101300	I'll take random TV shows.
4101300	4102300	Yeah.
4102300	4104420	I was like, I was like, it's free.
4104420	4109140	I'm not complaining about free short circuit to cool, which they had the first one, but
4109140	4110260	I remember too.
4110260	4115240	Uh, where, where could I find a old episodes of a small wonder?
4115240	4120500	That's another internet where where's, where's our like Harriet dolls.
4120500	4124820	They have like, was it Harriet was the neighbor Vicki Vicki was like, I think, I think they
4124820	4126260	had like Adam's family on there.
4126260	4128940	They had like a bunch of like Nick at night stuff on there too.
4128940	4130900	Like I dream a genie was on there.
4130900	4132700	Like it just random shit.
4132700	4134380	I don't know.
4134380	4135380	Anyway.
4135380	4140340	Uh, they're, they're talking about a downer endings in our chat room at live.com cause
4140340	4142420	the Alf sitcom had a downer ending.
4142420	4147540	Uh, and then, uh, act deaf to saying dinosaurs series ending though.
4147540	4148540	That was a downer.
4148980	4150620	I don't even remember the end of that one.
4150620	4152740	Uh, spoiler alert.
4152740	4155020	If I remember right, a comet hits the earth and kills them all.
4155020	4156020	I guess that makes sense.
4156020	4157020	Yeah.
4157020	4158540	Cause that's kind of what happens.
4158540	4159540	Yeah.
4159540	4160540	If I remember, am I right on that?
4160540	4162340	I just remember that was the thing.
4162340	4166740	Like a comet hits the earth, kills them all.
4166740	4167740	Which why are we laughing?
4167740	4168740	It's not funny.
4172740	4176540	Remember when all the dinosaurs died?
4177540	4178540	All right.
4178540	4179540	Anyway.
4179540	4185340	Oh, active says an ice age happens and they're realizing that they will die a slow frozen
4185340	4186340	death.
4186340	4187340	I was close.
4187340	4188340	Oh, that's even better.
4188340	4189340	I was close.
4189340	4190340	That's even funnier.
4190340	4191340	All right.
4191340	4193340	Anyway.
4193340	4194340	Let's move on.
4194340	4195340	Loki, what do you have for us?
4195340	4196340	All right.
4196340	4202540	So, um, splatoon two, unfortunately a lot of the games on the switch are running into
4202540	4203540	hacker issues.
4204540	4208540	Um, and apparently splatoon two is one of these games that's actually pretty easy for
4208540	4210340	players to hack.
4210340	4215340	So what did one, um, hacker do to splatoon two?
4215340	4221780	Well, they took, um, the leaderboard for competitive play and put up, they got the top four spots
4221780	4228840	and spelled out, please add anti-cheat basically said it wasn't just a joke.
4228840	4234540	They wanted to send a message to Nintendo about how easy it is to hack their game.
4234540	4240040	So yeah, because you know, now with all the mods and stuff that they have for the switch,
4240040	4245940	it's easy for them to modify the game and be able to, you know, do all sorts of nonsense
4245940	4246940	in there.
4246940	4249140	I'll show you hacks the planet.
4249140	4250140	Yeah.
4250140	4254740	So, I mean, did Nintendo like fix this already or what?
4254740	4256160	No, not yet.
4256160	4257160	Not yet.
4257160	4258160	They probably will.
4258160	4260360	And by the time this show is airing, I'm sure it will pretty well.
4260360	4261360	They've done it.
4261360	4266160	Well, they fixed it by removing the hacker's message, um, and says, but the recent update,
4266160	4270760	there's no signs of anti-cheat measures that have been added into the game and says what
4270760	4271760	they should do.
4271760	4276320	And in the least is to add parameters, to check things like they did in the first game,
4276320	4278180	the correct misconfigured parameters.
4278180	4282480	When someone joins a game on top of that, the game should have various sanity checks
4282480	4283480	during gameplay.
4283480	4289080	So basically, you know, like to verify that, Oh, the rate of fire of your rocket there
4289080	4295120	isn't like, you know, it's a consistent amount and not like 80 times per second or something
4295120	4296120	like that.
4296120	4301540	Um, let's see, uh, going to chat at live.vognetwork.com, uh, dar Tetsuya says, I heard the guy got
4301540	4302540	banned.
4302540	4303540	So I don't know if that counts.
4303540	4304540	Oh yes.
4304540	4305540	Thank you.
4305540	4308000	You know, of course, because he won't come back under it with a new hat.
4308000	4312720	Well, it's still, it's, I understand like the guy wasn't trying to be destructive about
4312720	4313720	it.
4313720	4315200	He's like trying to tell him, Hey, you need to fix something.
4315200	4320280	And so how they reward that by fucking banning him, uh, going to chat here, here's another
4320280	4321660	comment about eighties TV.
4321660	4322660	You ready?
4322660	4323660	All right.
4323660	4324660	I'm ready.
4324660	4327240	Uh, I had two in our chat, which is a, I don't recognize that name.
4327240	4328240	So welcome.
4328240	4329240	Hello.
4329240	4333140	I had two and Chad says, I have a channel here in Richmond called antenna TV that has
4333140	4336880	small wonder soap, Mr. Belvedere Benson.
4336880	4338100	It's pretty rad.
4338100	4340200	You know, that's, that's a good point.
4340200	4345400	Is that a lot of these like random fucking shit is ever since they converted from the
4345400	4350120	analog to the digital, because it got so much easier to do digital stations like check your
4350120	4351120	digital stuff.
4351120	4353880	Cause I don't even know if all these exist on cable.
4353880	4359320	You might have to actually go to like the antenna and go to like, go to like your CBS,
4359320	4366480	but go to like the dot two and the dot three because there is some low budget television
4366480	4368160	happening in those places.
4368160	4370760	And sometimes it's just like a nonstop weather channel.
4370760	4372560	Some of them are like a nonstop news channel.
4372560	4376020	Uh, some of them, you know, they're just like, like different stuff.
4376020	4377280	Radio does this too.
4377280	4382600	Uh, there's like random radio stations on the HD, but I don't think a lot of cars have
4382600	4383600	like the HD radio.
4383600	4388280	I don't, I think that's more of like a, I, my car, my old car had an HD radio tuner or
4388280	4394480	I had, I had a NHC radio tuner in my car and it was garbage.
4395240	4399640	Like I have a, I have a Prius, which is a, you know, and it's a, it's a 2016 Prius.
4399640	4403560	It's kind of a newer car caught on because people are like, ah, streaming services, streaming
4403560	4410640	services, you know, podcasts like satellite radio, putting your iPod or iPhone or whatever,
4410640	4416480	or Android, you know, all that stuff into the, you know, uh, car basically is, is kind
4416480	4417480	of the new thing.
4417480	4419640	And everybody's using streaming Spotify or, or podcasts.
4419640	4423000	And I'm sure there's a lot of people that listen to us in the car on their commutes.
4423000	4424000	Hello.
4424040	4427840	So anyway, uh, but I was gonna say with the TV, that is so true.
4427840	4430960	There is a lot of that random stuff and I bet anything, the channel that he's mentioning
4430960	4433280	is probably one of those type of channels.
4433280	4434920	That's where buzzer comes from too.
4434920	4438760	Y'all know I love me some buzzer on Twitch cause they stream it on Twitch too, which
4438760	4440840	is the old ass game shows.
4440840	4443000	It's like seventies match game.
4443000	4449360	And so the one over the air is the one that has like supermarket sweep and like additional
4449360	4451600	stuff that they don't even have on the Twitch one.
4451600	4454040	So, and I guess somebody was telling me, I think I saw a tweet.
4454040	4459200	You can watch like a live feed of buzzer also on their website or something.
4459200	4460960	So kind of, kind of neat.
4460960	4461960	Anyway.
4461960	4465140	Uh, Tyler Kalan chat says, who listens to radio anymore?
4465140	4466600	There's nothing good on it.
4466600	4468240	Internet radio for the win.
4468240	4471320	I do once in a while.
4471320	4476880	And the reason why is that I do find the one thing that local TV and local radio still
4476880	4482960	are able to do that no one else can quite match is local news.
4482960	4488600	That's the one place that they still do very well with, especially in the TV side of things
4488600	4489600	with radio.
4489600	4494820	There's just not a lot of like locally, but you know, the terrestrial radio would be very
4494820	4497600	smart to embrace more of the community side of things.
4497600	4499560	Cause that's how they get more people to listen to it.
4499560	4503320	I think anyway, that's my thoughts on that.
4503640	4508560	Um, let's move on and talk about, uh, smash brothers.
4508560	4514260	So a super smash brothers may be going to be getting a demo, maybe.
4514260	4516960	Uh, I think some of the other smash brothers games had demos.
4516960	4520600	I seem to remember there was one on like 3d, it was one on 3d S soon to remember.
4520600	4526240	Um, so anyway, uh, splatoon two and arms, they had demos, you know, to test launches
4526240	4527520	or whatever you want to call it.
4527520	4531480	Um, maybe in that sense, like it's a beta test type thing.
4531480	4537600	IGN, uh, talked with bill Trinen at, uh, the San Diego comic con and the response was
4537600	4539560	very good question right now.
4539560	4541840	They're focused very much on getting the game ready.
4541840	4545200	We have a few other things to talk about down the road between now and when it launches
4545200	4550080	in December, we'll hopefully have some news on that as we get closer to launch.
4550080	4554160	And uh, that could also mean, I guess the characters, they're kind of talking about,
4554160	4556640	you know, more characters getting revealed before December.
4556640	4561000	But I think kind of like soccer, I said in that early video, don't expect like a thousand
4561000	4562000	new characters.
4562000	4566160	Like there's probably going to be, I want 2000 new characters, be a couple more.
4566160	4567160	That's it.
4567160	4572800	All of the characters, uh, every single Pokemon from all of the generations in there.
4572800	4578480	So interesting is apparently, uh, because smash brothers ultimate is listed on the official
4578480	4584360	Japanese Nintendo website, 16 gigs of space is what the game is going to require.
4584360	4587040	They say 16 gigs or more.
4587080	4592000	So, um, if you're going to use internal storage for this, that's like over half your internal
4592000	4593000	storage.
4593000	4594000	Why?
4594000	4597640	What, what could possibly take up that much space?
4597640	4604880	All those fucking characters and the animations in what I assume will be 60 frames a second.
4604880	4605880	There's just a lot going on.
4605880	4609400	Anyway, it might be a good time to think about getting a micro SD card if you don't already
4609400	4610400	have one.
4610400	4611560	I finally, I bought a micro SD card.
4611560	4613600	I got a 128 gigabyte one.
4613600	4615800	I think I got, I think I got a 120.
4615800	4616800	I don't even know now.
4616800	4617800	It was 40 bucks.
4617800	4618800	Never going to be enough.
4618800	4619800	It's never going to be enough.
4619800	4620800	It was 40 bucks.
4620800	4625520	And then like the very next, so I bought it at Best Buy and then the very next day was
4625520	4632480	that Amazon prime fuck show and it was like 19 bucks on Amazon prime, but I didn't end
4632480	4637080	up getting anything on the prime thing because I was like, there's this, I feel like a lot
4637080	4641200	of that stuff is just trying to entice me to buy shit I don't really need.
4641200	4644720	They had, I really just, they had a Fitbit I wanted, but I still didn't buy it.
4644720	4647880	I looked at clothes, but I didn't see anything that screamed at me.
4647880	4648880	So I didn't do it.
4648880	4651120	They have a lot of garbage on there.
4651120	4652120	Anyway.
4652120	4653120	All right.
4653120	4654120	Moving on.
4654120	4657240	Uh, let's talk about Jamie.
4657240	4658240	Let's talk about you.
4658240	4659240	No.
4659240	4660240	Jamie has a story for us.
4660240	4661240	Neopets.
4661240	4662240	Who remembers Neopets?
4662240	4663240	Me.
4663240	4664240	Me.
4664240	4665240	Oh my God.
4665240	4666240	I haven't fed my Neopet in 13 years.
4666240	4667240	Do you think it's dead?
4667240	4668240	Uh, they never die.
4668240	4670060	Do you think it slowly died in the ice age?
4670060	4671060	Like the dinosaurs?
4671060	4672060	They never die.
4672500	4678420	But anyway, um, there, we're gonna have a return of Neopets as a mobile app that will
4678420	4680460	be, uh, puzzle games.
4680460	4685140	It looks like, uh, there is going to be like a Scrabble game.
4685140	4690140	Um, but it is gonna be different, you know, than the Neopets account.
4690140	4694100	So if you still had your Neopets account for some reason or another, yeah, you've lost
4694100	4695100	all that shit.
4695100	4697660	But, I don't know.
4697660	4700140	I mean, what are we gonna get next?
4700140	4702220	Gaia online.
4702220	4703220	Why not?
4703220	4704220	You know what?
4704220	4706060	Uh, Club Penguin.
4706060	4708820	I think I still have my two Gaia online accounts.
4708820	4709820	Do you?
4709820	4710820	Uh, Ragnaros, of course.
4710820	4716380	But there actually is a Ragnaros, uh, that little, uh, Ragnarock, sorry, I'm, I'm getting
4716380	4720420	my, uh, Heroes of the Storm bug, uh, crossed.
4720420	4724220	Uh, yes, Ragnarock online and then there, but they have that phone game.
4724220	4728300	Private, well, private servers are still up, again, I'm playing, um, Idle Poring.
4728300	4729300	That's it.
4729460	4731700	Actually, uh, RO2 is free, still on Steam.
4731700	4732820	Oh, that's cool.
4732820	4735300	And it, all the music in it was done by Yoko Kanno, so.
4735300	4736380	Oh, cool.
4736380	4741700	So it was really cute, I mean, it, it was just more of the same, you know.
4741700	4744860	So are you gonna check out the new, the Neopets Reborn?
4744860	4747120	Yeah, probably, cause I like Scrabble.
4747120	4748780	The mutated Neopets.
4748780	4750860	Well, I like word games.
4750860	4752860	Hardcore Neopets.
4752860	4753860	I like word games.
4753860	4759260	Yes, but the only words you're able to spell are, like, violence, kill your parents, um,
4759260	4766180	murder your stinky poop, worship Satan, uh, anyway, I worship Santa.
4766180	4767180	I'm just kidding.
4767180	4768180	None of that is funny.
4768180	4769180	All right.
4769180	4770180	Uh, Loki.
4770180	4776740	All right, um, so there, one of the things, the stories that came out, um, while we were
4776740	4780500	out was this whole thing about aliens, Colonial Marines.
4780500	4786420	So there was a bug in the AI that had to do with actually, it was just one thing that
4786420	4793020	was misspelled, one, um, line that was misspelled in there was causing some issues where the
4793020	4799140	AI didn't know which room it was in, so it couldn't react to the player in, like, very
4799140	4803140	intelligent ways, and which is why, you know, the AI was really dumb.
4803140	4809800	So, um, you know, fast forward to now, where that's been fixed by, you know, fixing the
4809800	4812340	typo in the INI file.
4812340	4819320	And now, Gearbox has apparently taken to putting up a, I don't know, it looks like a fake job
4819320	4825980	posting on their site, um, to kind of poke fun at the stupid mistake that they made.
4825980	4833460	Um, so, apparently the site has a job listing for programming copy editor, specific duties
4833460	4841140	of review all code for typos, desired skills and experience, enjoys finding typos, required
4841140	4847040	skills and experience, click apply and pass a rigorous questionnaire located on the application.
4847040	4852560	The questionnaire, I guess, is referring to, um, and the listing consists of the same question
4852560	4854180	in an open text box.
4854180	4862860	Please respond to the correct spelling of tether or tether, teether, I guess.
4862860	4867760	I mean, yeah, haha, it's fun to poke fun at yourself, but haha, this has been broken forever
4867760	4871500	and you didn't fucking go through to see if you can fix the problem.
4871500	4876380	Like a spelling error, you would think that that would be something pretty easy to catch
4876380	4879440	and you just said, fuck it, who cares?
4879440	4884300	So I kind of find it a little bit insulting that they poke fun at that.
4884300	4889680	I'm of two mindsets because I always enjoy a company that can have that sense of like
4889680	4891900	self-deprecating humor a little bit.
4891900	4897440	You know, who doesn't love the Wendy's social media account or, um, who else is, who else
4897440	4904000	is a sass on Twitter, Denny's Arby's Arby's, you know, all those, but here's the thing
4904000	4908820	in the time it took to write that clever little tweet and pace or, and post that fake job
4908820	4913840	posting and all that, um, you could have probably fixed this problem.
4913840	4914840	You know what I mean?
4914840	4920180	Like, well, I mean, obviously this was an incredibly simple thing to fix and it's, it's
4920180	4922860	really weird that it just was not found.
4922860	4923860	I just don't understand.
4923860	4926180	Like, did, did no one like go through that?
4926180	4928400	I mean, well, and here's the thing that I don't understand too.
4928400	4933400	On top of that, it's like, okay, you built this game and you shipped the game.
4933400	4937280	You obviously, I assume you tested the game.
4937280	4940000	Didn't you see that there was something fucking wrong with it?
4940000	4943000	And like, wouldn't you think, okay, this is AI related.
4943000	4946880	I'm going to talk to the guy that built, you know, the AI portion of this engine or whatever
4946880	4951180	and figure out, let's see if we can get down to what the issue is.
4951180	4955240	Like did, it seems like no one fucking did anything.
4955240	4956240	Here's the thing.
4956240	4962780	A lot of times in the industry, my understanding is that some bugs are reported and an executive
4962780	4966660	decision is made to keep the game on track to release a certain time.
4966660	4967660	They don't fix them.
4967660	4970900	Just, it just depends on the severity of the bug, what it does and all that stuff.
4970900	4973580	Some bugs don't get fixed and it is a choice.
4973580	4979620	The weird thing about this though, this like with this easy of a fix as it is, it's not
4979620	4983300	like we're talking about, you have to go in and like fix all this.
4983800	4988840	This is a very, it's one character, like I could probably, I could fix an INI file.
4988840	4991840	If I can fucking do it, they can fucking do it.
4991840	5000180	So it is really weird to me how that whole thing like snuck through, like that's a disaster.
5000180	5003840	As we were talking about earlier, you know, someone mentioned that, oh, hey, why don't
5003840	5006880	developers just abandon their game and not fix stuff?
5006880	5007880	Boom.
5007880	5008880	There you go.
5008880	5009880	Gearbox.
5009880	5010880	They're your man.
5010880	5015660	You know that they're there for you to not fix shit.
5015660	5017660	There you go.
5017660	5019220	Look forward to Borderlands 3.
5019220	5025580	All right, anyway, speaking of typos ruining everything, some people really perked up this
5025580	5029960	week when apparently Microsoft said that there was going to be an announcement with all new
5029960	5036020	Xbox hardware and people were like, well, it is time for Gamescom.
5036020	5040860	So I mean, even though it's a weird time for a company to announce new hardware, what is
5040860	5043720	what is the traditional calendar for this stuff anymore?
5043720	5044720	Right?
5044720	5048000	Remember, the switch came out in March and it did great.
5048000	5052980	So timetables for game consoles even are screwed up these days.
5052980	5055160	So a lot of people perked up and said, why?
5055160	5059840	Microsoft's going to be like doing the new console this early or doing something.
5059840	5061660	Well, here's the deal.
5061660	5064840	It was kind of a typo, basically.
5064840	5071260	So what ended up happening is that Major Nelson put out a tweet that said the wording
5071260	5076560	in the original post that said all new hardware and accessories was inaccurate.
5076560	5081720	What you're really going to get, you get new bundle and accessory news that's being shared
5081720	5082720	in Germany.
5082720	5089020	So what I meant to say is, you know, instead of wood, it's actually wooden.
5089020	5094300	There wouldn't be any news for for new all new hardware.
5094360	5096200	Sorry for the confusion.
5096200	5098000	He asked and they said it was OK.
5102880	5108000	Well, what happened is that we had to ask Sony if it was OK for us to unveil the new
5108000	5110680	hardware. And Sony said it was OK.
5110680	5112160	And Sony said it was OK.
5112760	5114400	So he said we would.
5114400	5115400	I mean, what?
5115400	5125700	Here, I thought this was just going to be another slow episode of the show, and that's
5125700	5130020	probably one of my favorite zingers that's come up in the past, like, year on this program.
5130020	5136340	Anyway, new hardware and accessories.
5136340	5141820	So, yeah, exciting, I guess that that does mean, you know, made it cheaper, you know,
5141820	5144780	serious. I thought they were supposed to have like a redesigned controller or something
5144800	5147320	that was supposed to be coming out at some point, because I know that they were having
5147320	5149320	like a new controller of some sort.
5150080	5154760	I thought maybe maybe I'm mistaken, but I thought they had like a new accessory or
5154760	5156080	controller or something that was coming out.
5156080	5160160	So that's probably what you're going to see a games com, but not like how you are.
5160400	5162600	Maybe no HoloLens.
5163520	5166520	I would love for HoloLens to come down in price.
5166520	5170040	That's just it doesn't that doesn't seem like a games com type of thing.
5170040	5174560	Yeah, I think that's a, you know, CS, CS or a GD.
5175200	5179200	Like the next phase of what that looks like type of thing for developers.
5179200	5180400	I don't know. That's too early.
5180800	5186920	Anyway, let's get to let's get to a more, you know, redesign, you know, VR controllers.
5186920	5189480	Sony, can we please get something?
5189680	5191840	All right, let's get to a simpler timing game.
5192720	5194320	Let's go back to a time when there wasn't VR.
5194320	5197360	You didn't have VR. Actually, no, we had VR back in this time.
5197360	5198880	It was just it was lawnmower.
5199120	5203440	Yeah, lawnmower. The mind's eye, it was all the mind's eye.
5203440	5205540	All the VR like footage of the mind's eye.
5205780	5210380	Yeah, it's it's the classic game of the week.
5210660	5213760	Dark Sakura goes to the gaming ball, blah, blah, blah.
5213760	5215220	Play this game, blah, blah, blah.
5215220	5215660	What is it?
5215660	5220620	Hey, I have this game, Blazing Lasers, also known as Gunhead in Japan,
5221100	5225460	which is a space shooter done by Hudson Soft and Compile.
5225780	5228980	So, you know, it's kind of sometimes a pain in the ass.
5228980	5236520	But it came out in Japan and North America in 1989 for the NEC PC Engine,
5236520	5238760	also known as the TurboGrafx-16 over here.
5239520	5242040	It's based off of the Japanese film called Gunhead,
5242680	5245400	although they removed references to the movie in North America.
5245800	5249400	Now that I know this, I might actually have to watch this movie,
5249400	5251080	so I'm going to go look for it.
5251080	5257040	Anyway, in the game, the galaxy is under attack by an any space
5257420	5262260	called the Dark Squadron, and so the only thing that can help them
5262260	5267100	is the Gunhead Advanced Starfighter, which would be pronounced GASK.
5268300	5274460	Anyway, so it is a vertical scrolling shooter and you go and you blow shit up.
5276000	5280060	It was actually developed by the same people who did Puyo Puyo
5280060	5283700	and Super Bomberman, as well as Xanax, The Guardian Legend,
5283700	5289640	and Doremi Fantasy, which that was Mylon's Doki Doki Adventures.
5292000	5297280	And it has since been released on the Wii Virtual Console in North America,
5297280	5300480	Europe and Australia in 2007 and in Japan the following year,
5300840	5305880	and on the PlayStation Network in 2010 and on the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2014.
5306640	5312040	So basically, you know, this is I'd probably say, you know, keep in mind
5312660	5316560	the PC Engine got a shit ton of shooters.
5316560	5319600	I mean, an inordinate amount of shooters.
5319600	5321280	Some of them were garbage.
5321280	5323180	Some of them were amazing.
5323180	5328680	And I'm actually pretty happy that Blazing Lasers came out over here
5328680	5331120	because it was a ridiculously good game
5331680	5335560	when we kind of got some garbage on Turbo Grappler.
5337720	5341800	In this game, you have a rapid fire cannon that you can upgrade
5341820	5346320	or you can change other weapons into power ups and these orbs called gel capsules.
5347660	5351560	You can also get multi bodies that shadow your action.
5351560	5355240	They have homing missiles, shields, different firing capability
5355240	5359740	called full fire, and you get cluster bombs, all kinds of just fun weapons.
5360140	5362580	But of course, my favorite is the big laser cannon
5362580	5364940	that makes me think of Raiden.
5365740	5368520	You remember Raiden, of course, Raiden is one of those games.
5369240	5371780	Um, is that what the wavy gravy or whatever?
5372180	5377420	Well, the one in Raiden just latches on and swirls around until it gets them.
5377420	5380660	But this one will actually, I think, shoot up and home in on them.
5381020	5383520	Like in like 90 degree angles.
5383520	5385160	It's just a really, really cool weapon.
5386500	5389200	But yeah, other things that they did together.
5389200	5391540	I mean, basically the people who are behind this.
5391540	5396340	It was directed by Nittani Masamitsu, who is also called Roo.
5397200	5399160	Um, but he was the creator of Zanac.
5399160	5404640	He's the creator of the Guardian Legend, you know, and the PLPL series.
5406840	5409100	We just had such an amazing cast on this.
5409100	5412240	That's probably why this is still one of my favorite shooters, because
5413280	5417780	it had so many of those things in common with the Guardian Legend.
5417780	5420320	It was as far as power ups and the way that it moved.
5420320	5422520	But it was really, really solid.
5423040	5428940	Um, it was really listed as one of the best,
5429680	5430820	I would say, 8-bit shooters.
5430820	5433680	Just keep in mind, the turbo graphics is not a 16-bit system.
5434020	5436220	It is still, it's still an 8-bit
5437960	5441260	processor with a 16-bit graphic processor.
5443960	5446560	Yeah, it's like a weird hybrid.
5446560	5449300	And on top of that, Blazing Lasers was
5450280	5455120	probably the big thing that people were getting when they were playing our title.
5455720	5458920	So I would say, you know, if no one here has played it
5458920	5463160	or they've seen like the kind of crappy artwork that came on the turbo chip,
5464100	5466300	you know, in the U.S., don't let that fool you.
5466300	5469700	It's kind of like how I look at Master System game art, you know,
5470400	5472400	where it's kind of generic looking.
5473080	5475380	Um, this is an excellent game.
5475380	5477540	If you haven't played it, why the fuck not?
5478420	5481100	And that's it, Blazing Lasers, a.k.a.
5481100	5483560	Gunhead. Now I'm going to find the movie.
5484460	5485760	All right. There it is.
5485760	5487860	Classic game of the week, Blazing Lasers.
5487860	5489600	Dude, this poster looks awesome.
5491740	5494140	All right. OK, I need
5494140	5496080	I think they have a ship in it called the Marianne.
5496080	5498640	I think I actually did play this game once. It's pretty rad.
5498780	5499940	I like that game.
5499940	5501540	So, all right.
5501540	5504340	We're going to take a break, but there is more Orange Laundry to come.
5504340	5506680	We have rapid fire news when we get back.
5506680	5508360	Travel around the world and look at some release dates.
5508360	5510900	We're going to talk a little bit about accessibility in games.
5511300	5514140	Some efforts to help developers make more aware about that.
5514400	5516900	And we'll talk a little bit about Mega Man and some of the Mega Man news
5516900	5519600	at a Comic-Con that I'm sure Loki is thrilled about.
5519800	5522640	We'll get to that when we come back with more of Orange Laundry.
5522640	5524540	Holy shit. The U.S.
5524540	5526740	DVD of this is seventy seven dollars.
5526780	5528720	How dare you interrupt my outro?
5528720	5531240	All right. As I was saying,
5531240	5534580	we'll be right back with more about Orange Laundry right after this.
5536680	5544320	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight.
5544320	5550300	Episode number 738 of our show for this July 22nd of 2018.
5550300	5555340	Already in progress with myself, Dark Soccer and Loki all here in studio
5555640	5558300	as we will plan to be over the next few weeks.
5558680	5561920	No shows, although unexpected things happen, such as happened last week.
5561920	5564580	But for the most part, should be here for the next few weeks.
5564580	5567120	The next show we're going to have off, though, is Labor Day weekend,
5567120	5569260	as has become typical over the past few years.
5569460	5571820	I don't think we've done a show on Labor Day weekend in probably
5571820	5574660	about six or seven years because I've been going to Dragon Con every year
5574660	5576600	since since VOG was a thing.
5576600	5580060	So, yeah, I'm really looking forward to this year's Dragon Con.
5580060	5582660	I can't say anything officially about the schedule yet
5582660	5584340	because it's not set in stone yet.
5584340	5589340	But stay tuned to my Twitter and VOG network for not just my schedule,
5589340	5592040	but we have a lot of representation from the different VOG shows
5592700	5595300	that'll be there at the Dragon Con this year.
5595840	5598140	I know, of course, Bobby should be doing some stuff as well.
5598340	5602840	But some of our other shows, I know, I don't know who all is confirmed
5602840	5606680	going this year, but I know usually like John from Critical Myth
5606680	5609020	and Gary from Critical Myth will probably be there.
5609020	5612500	Brian from British Invaders should be back this year.
5612500	5614720	So, you know, hopefully we'll have some representation
5614720	5617400	across some of the other TV and other media panels as well.
5617400	5619700	So looking forward to it.
5619700	5622460	In the meantime, let's move on with some more gaming news
5622460	5625000	and some rapid fire news going to Loki.
5625000	5628440	Yep. So we can talk a little bit about, you know, free updates.
5628440	5631900	As we were mentioning, Nomad Sky getting a pretty decent free update soon.
5632780	5636780	The Nintendo Switch is getting an update to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
5637180	5641680	So with that, you're going to be getting a Breath of the Wild
5642320	5645460	Breath of the Wild skinned version of the Master Cycle,
5646560	5648720	which is going to be something that's free as well.
5648740	5654660	You can also get the tunic from Breath of the Wild as well.
5655020	5657880	So that'll be updated for Link.
5659220	5662700	They said also there is going to have some ancient customization parts
5662700	5666460	will be added to the other games, cars and paragliders.
5666840	5669300	So you can change it up a bit.
5670040	5672360	Not bad for free.
5672360	5674440	JD and chat confirmed me that's already live.
5674440	5675540	Yeah, in the game. Yeah.
5675560	5676660	So I'm curious.
5676660	5680260	So like, why release it now?
5680260	5681260	I mean, that's that's neat.
5681260	5683940	I wonder if they have any other announcements that they're going.
5683940	5686800	Or is there still more DLC coming out for Breath of the Wild?
5687480	5692340	I think is there are the two big ones already happened.
5692840	5695020	But who knows? They might do more.
5695020	5698680	I still have to purchase it again because I remember I sold it when I got
5699580	5701520	my got rid of the Wii U.
5701520	5704720	So I saw they get I never played through it, honestly.
5704740	5707780	I mean, I was going to pick it up when it gets cheap.
5707880	5710440	Mm hmm. So I just that's a big time sink.
5711080	5713280	And I got to play Skyrim a couple more times, I'm sure.
5714120	5716880	Of course, Skyrim and 4K. It's 4K now.
5717280	5719960	Why not? I'm in VR.
5719960	5722520	And then something else coming to the switch, actually.
5722520	5725060	So you may remember South Park.
5725060	5728260	The Fractured But Whole did come to the Nintendo Switch.
5728800	5731500	What's also going to be coming, though, is the Stick of Truth.
5731540	5733500	That is also going to be coming to the switch.
5733520	5738120	And then along with that, on all platforms, though, is the brand new DLC
5738120	5742900	for South Park Fractured But Whole, the Bring the Crunch,
5743460	5746960	which is a new, I guess, campaign
5747840	5751300	which introduces a new class to its battle system
5752040	5754980	and has, I guess, some aliens.
5755480	5760180	The mint berry crunch, which is an alien from Coco John.
5761160	5765200	I don't know, but it does take place in the
5766800	5769540	was it late Lake Tardicaca.
5770900	5773900	Wow. So that's going to be kind of on
5774980	5778380	PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch and PC, July 31st.
5778640	5780320	It'll cost eleven ninety nine.
5780320	5782780	I can't remember this as part of the season pass.
5782780	5783720	I have the season pass.
5783720	5786480	I think if I remember correctly, I bought it with the season pass.
5786480	5788760	So I need to go back and play that because it was a great game.
5789600	5791080	All right.
5791080	5796080	Going to a couple more stories for you guys, starting with the Stardew Valleys multiplayer.
5796680	5800140	That is going live on the PC version of the game, August 1st.
5800720	5802980	Console multiplayer to follow after that.
5802980	5807480	There is a new trailer that you can watch that details all of this that came out on the Internet
5807800	5812080	that also shows the new farms that look really, really good.
5812080	5818160	So you can check that out over on YouTube or pretty much any gaming blog that probably ran the multiplayer update.
5818160	5821040	It's a good, relaxing, like
5821040	5823740	Animal Crossing style game, if you like that type of thing.
5823740	5828920	Yeah, I got to admit, I I I couldn't really get totally sucked into Stardew Valley
5828920	5831580	because it didn't really like it didn't guide me enough.
5831580	5834980	And I didn't like I couldn't really figure out like what I was really supposed to be doing.
5835420	5836820	And so it felt I don't know.
5836820	5840260	It's not really anything you're supposed to be a little too open ended to me.
5840260	5842660	If that's I need my games to have a little more structure.
5842660	5845020	Well, they have like the whole system where you can,
5845020	5849460	you know, unlock stuff in the community center.
5849460	5854700	So that kind of gets you going in different directions to try to like, you know, grow different things or whatever.
5855640	5860400	And then there's a relationship you can try to, you know, romance people in there.
5860740	5863080	Maybe if somebody really wants to play the multiplayer,
5863080	5865240	maybe I'll check it out again and get sucked in.
5865240	5868440	Or the dude that wants you to go on the boat because of the implication, you know.
5868440	5873480	Yeah, who knows? Anyway, I also news about Soulcalibur 6,
5873480	5876480	which I'm looking forward to coming out later this year.
5877180	5881860	It was confirmed that we will be getting Voldo as another character in that game.
5881860	5886460	So a lot of great characters from the past coming back for Soulcalibur 6,
5887120	5890060	who, of course, is the hell guardian of the game.
5890260	5892200	He's the one that has the creepy face mask.
5892200	5894200	I would like spikes on his eyes and stuff.
5894200	5897980	He looks kind of like weird, but he's back in Soulcalibur 6
5897980	5902640	for those that really enjoy his little like bendy fighting mechanics.
5903140	5908640	October 19th, again, is the day to look forward to this on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.
5908640	5911640	Then did you see the the Arby's?
5911780	5916920	I think it was cardboard like cosplay thing that they did for Soulcalibur.
5917520	5919660	It was pretty, pretty epic.
5919660	5922420	They they do a lot of that stuff, so I'm not too surprised.
5922860	5925600	So, all right, Darsaco, what do you have for us?
5925600	5927960	Oh, just stuff.
5928460	5933720	We are getting a Sega Ages Sonic the Hedgehog Thunder Force 4 included
5934920	5938660	a fantasy star and some more games.
5939160	5941760	It looks like it's going to be coming out on.
5943060	5945740	Hold on. Does it say it's on the switch?
5945740	5946740	Yeah, it's coming out on the switch.
5946740	5949700	Well, there was also a mention of oh, yeah,
5949780	5953880	Sonic will have different elements from the 3DS version, like the added spin dash
5954860	5957900	and the mega play arcade version.
5958200	5961980	Thunder Force 4 will include Styx mode from the Sega Saturn version,
5962280	5963720	and it will have leaderboards.
5963720	5967080	Other ones are coming like Alex Kidd in Miracle World, Gain Ground,
5967080	5970420	and like I said earlier, Fantasy Star.
5970420	5973860	Also, well, you know,
5974460	5980900	Team Instinct has been kind of the the whippin' boy of Pokemon Go because mad.
5981460	5983860	I don't know if anyone else saw that comic.
5983880	5989520	But Team Instinct has fully redeemed themselves at this year's Pokemon Go Fest.
5990820	5993020	Team Mystic, what did I say?
5993020	5997160	Yeah, Team Mystic was fairly looking smug,
5997500	6001940	according to what I remember reading on this,
6001940	6003960	except it turned out that
6005160	6007500	Team Instinct were
6009200	6013580	the highest number of research tasks completed nine million.
6014220	6016420	They've blown the other two teams out of the water.
6016420	6018780	So good job, yellow team.
6019120	6023120	So honestly, especially after now having reached max level in Ingress,
6023120	6025820	let me tell you, the teams in Pokemon Go, they don't matter.
6026260	6028820	It's mad. They don't. It's mad.
6029420	6032800	Yeah, there's still no game yet.
6032800	6034560	Well, I mean, there's no competitive game.
6034560	6036700	It's not. Yeah, it's not a competitive game. Exactly.
6036840	6038840	So, all right.
6038840	6041040	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates
6041060	6043720	and some games that will be coming out soon in a store near you,
6043720	6045500	starting with the U.S., Loki.
6045500	6047040	Well, we have a few things coming out this week.
6047040	6050600	So Mega Man X Legacy Collection is going to be coming out on PC,
6050600	6052640	the Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6053700	6055780	Of course, you know, with No Man's Sky next,
6055780	6058780	the Xbox One version of No Man's Sky is going to be coming out
6059740	6065660	with the Banner Saga 3 on PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6066580	6070860	And then looks like Ys Memories of Celcita.
6071260	6073100	And that's on PC.
6073100	6077600	And Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation 2 on PlayStation 4.
6078160	6082080	And let's see, last but not least, we've got
6082740	6085240	Go Vacation on Nintendo Switch.
6085440	6089120	And in a game I'm sure my kids will want to play for some stupid reason
6089120	6090340	because they see it on YouTube.
6090340	6094260	But Hello Neighbor is going to be coming out on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,
6094720	6096520	iOS and Android.
6096520	6099320	And it's a stealth survivor horror game
6099340	6101240	about breaking into someone's house and trying to steal stuff
6101240	6102740	while he tries to kill you. I don't know.
6102740	6104880	I know I've watched videos of it.
6104880	6105740	That's it.
6106540	6110180	All right, let's travel to Japan, where on the 26th of July,
6110180	6113360	we have Mysetsu Pier Station comes out.
6113360	6117800	There's a regular version of this and one that comes with a figure as well.
6117800	6119120	So that's kind of interesting.
6119120	6121320	I don't know if you get to, like, you know,
6121320	6124600	have sex with the figure or something, but I don't think it's that kind of game.
6124900	6127840	What? That's a jump to conclusions there.
6129500	6132080	Well, it just it just looks like another one of those.
6132080	6136240	Anyway, this oh, God, this game based on the cover art for this game.
6136240	6139680	This is more of the game that I think people are going to want to fornicate
6139680	6142180	with fake versions of the characters.
6142180	6145480	Senran Kagura, Peach Beach Splash.
6145480	6148620	Oh, right. It's Senran Kagura. I mean, of course, that's right.
6148620	6152460	The naughty ninja girls of Senran Kagura are going to be taking it.
6152460	6156360	This is basically dead or alive beach volleyball, but it's squirt guns.
6156360	6158300	Yeah, it's squirt guns and bikinis.
6158300	6160500	That's right. White bikinis.
6160500	6162700	So you know where this is going.
6162700	6166620	Anyway, the Rockman X anniversary collection one and two.
6166620	6168020	Obviously, that's what they call Mega Man over there.
6168020	6170500	That is also out on July 26th.
6170500	6175100	And you can get a game called My Kai Senke Disgaea Refine.
6175820	6179220	I don't think that is the same Disgaea game.
6179220	6181060	Oh, no, it is. It is the Disgaea series.
6181060	6183460	So it's like probably some type of like definitive version.
6183740	6185260	That's pretty cool.
6186140	6191420	And then a Dragon Quest X all in one package, versions one through four,
6191860	6194260	also releasing in Japan this week,
6194820	6199220	along with a game called Spin Tires Mud Runner is out in Japan this week.
6199220	6201220	So it's a pretty busy week in Japan.
6201220	6204220	A lot of games going into the PlayStation hits collection over there as well,
6204220	6208300	including Bloodborne, Little Big Planet 3 and Ratchet and Clank the Game,
6208500	6210340	as well as Last of Us Remastered.
6210340	6213780	All of those come out on the 26th as well.
6214260	6215620	And if that isn't enough,
6215620	6219540	why not get the PlayStation 4 Monster Hunter World Value Pack?
6220540	6225300	That is some type of, I think, system plus game type of bundle.
6226620	6229540	That is pretty much it for the Sony stuff.
6229540	6231820	Looking quickly to see if Nintendo has anything.
6232060	6234820	Yeah, Nintendo has the Rock Band collection as well.
6234820	6239700	That My Kai Senke Disgaea, the Disgaea remaster is over there as well.
6240140	6243140	Wolfenstein II The New Colossus gets its Japanese remake.
6243380	6245860	Dragon Quest 10 is out on the Switch in Japan,
6245860	6248300	so it's going to get that all in one package as well.
6248580	6254820	And Daito Shouken no Hitsu Jikai Library Party.
6255620	6257620	So ain't no party like a library party.
6258460	6260980	Because the library party don't start until everyone shuts the fuck up.
6264940	6269260	All right. Stacks books moving on to the UK, Dark Sakura.
6269420	6274140	We have on the 24th Train Sim World for PlayStation and Xbox.
6274140	6278220	We have on PlayStation the Persistence VR on the 25th.
6279140	6281900	No Man's Sky on the 27th.
6281940	6285940	Other things on the 27th is Hello Neighbor for Switch and PlayStation.
6287100	6289340	Go Vacation on Switch.
6289860	6292980	The Banner Saga Trilogy Bonus Edition,
6292980	6296020	also on the 27th for PlayStation and Xbox.
6296020	6298380	That's it.
6300060	6301980	All right. Better than a shart.
6301980	6304740	This is the part of the show where we would get to the mailbag.
6306340	6307540	If we had any emails.
6307540	6311420	We need a sad version of that song, like in a minor key, minor key.
6311420	6315340	Yeah. Well, you should just start playing like the funeral dirge.
6317140	6320820	So anyway, my point is to send us emails.
6320980	6323780	That was that was two weeks and no emails.
6324020	6325420	I'm depressed now.
6325420	6329580	We got some people asking us to vote in a gubernatorial
6330100	6332180	thing in a state we don't have in that.
6332300	6334780	Jeez. We haven't gotten any Russian porn spam, though.
6335020	6336700	Well, that's a plus, I guess.
6336700	6338740	That was something we used to get on the old email address, right?
6339660	6343260	That's a relief. Anyway, if you want to send us an email, please no spam.
6343460	6345900	Participate at OrangeLoundTrader.com
6346020	6349860	unless your spam comes with like Bitcoin or
6350300	6351940	although I wouldn't know what to do with Bitcoin.
6352940	6357700	I or, you know, a freak steam codes will take those two.
6357860	6361940	Where was I where they said that we take cryptocurrency?
6362180	6363580	I was in San Francisco.
6363580	6366060	It was somewhere like walking toward Saks.
6366740	6369460	And in the window it says we take cryptocurrency.
6369460	6371020	I'm like, you do.
6371060	6374260	There's a lot of random places, especially in the Bay Area, that will take
6374260	6378420	cryptocurrency as, you know, payment for whatever is the Dyson vacuum place.
6378420	6379460	No, it wasn't the Dyson.
6379460	6383620	But there's a cryptocurrency ATM outside of
6384260	6386700	the arcade that's in the Roswell Galleria.
6387140	6388660	Yes, I've seen that.
6388660	6391500	The I'm just like, why does this even exist?
6391540	6394300	Yeah, I don't I don't even understand how it works.
6394340	6396140	This is this is where I start to go.
6396140	6397620	I'm old. I'm 40.
6397620	6401580	Herp derp, because I don't I don't keep your dollars in a mattress.
6401660	6403780	I would like one cryptocurrency, please.
6403780	6406340	Yes, I would like one cryptocurrency.
6406340	6411340	And I want to make a cryptocurrency called cryptocurrency.
6411380	6412940	Can we do that? I mean, come on.
6412940	6414460	Everything's like something coin.
6414460	6416980	Let's just do I want cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency.
6417660	6422540	I would I would be so down with making VOG coin or if if Bobby Black Wolf
6422540	6423620	frowns on that, then fine.
6423620	6425620	Oh, our coin. He can't stop us from doing that.
6425620	6430460	But I'm all for like a currency that we own.
6430460	6433540	But the question would be, what are you going to buy with it?
6433540	6436020	Because that's how you're going to really give it value is
6436340	6442940	make it worth something that like you can trade in one VOG coin for like X.
6443140	6445700	You know what I mean? Like me screaming at you.
6446380	6448580	I mean, one VOG coin for me to scream at you.
6448580	6449780	That's terrible. I hate that.
6449780	6452540	I'm surprised no one's made cryptocurrency for Shrewt books yet.
6453020	6457140	Technically, we kind of it's not like an actual cryptocurrency,
6457140	6460740	but technically we have like whose line is it anyway?
6460740	6462580	We have the points and the points don't matter.
6462580	6464140	But you should still play the game anyway.
6464300	6467500	That's all built into the website, which is why you get that passphrase
6467500	6468620	that shows up during the show.
6468620	6472340	If you're listening on the podcast or if you're listening live, remember, plug,
6472340	6476260	plug, you just go to live.vognetwork.com and you can click the thing and you can,
6476260	6477140	you know, get points.
6477340	6480620	And once in a while, the site gives you loot when you do certain things.
6480620	6482060	It's like you build up your little profile.
6482060	6484940	It's collect them all because why?
6484940	6487740	Why do you why do you collect them and Pokemon go? Why not?
6487740	6489300	So we do have that.
6489300	6490740	We may not have our own cryptocurrency,
6490740	6493780	but we have our own points and the points don't matter system.
6495140	6496940	So anyway, let's see.
6496940	6499740	I'm looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
6500340	6503980	Let's see. Tiger class says, use VOG coins to buy games.
6503980	6505220	That would be one use for it.
6505220	6508300	OK, Loki's game will only be purchasable with VOG coins.
6509460	6511460	Well, I can't wait to make zero money on that.
6512820	6514860	Oh, God. All right.
6516100	6520420	Anyway, let's move on to some more video game news stories.
6520420	6522540	Loki. All right.
6522540	6524740	Well, this is kind of cool.
6524740	6531060	So apparently there is this a game dev, I guess, a game maker's toolkit.
6531060	6535540	It's basically a games writer by the name of Mark Brown.
6535740	6541340	And he takes deep dives on certain aspects of gaming from level design to music.
6541620	6544820	So he started a new series now called Making Games Better.
6545180	6550020	And so with that, it's his first episode is basically making
6550060	6552540	games better for the deaf and hard of hearing.
6552820	6554580	So designing for disability.
6556300	6559700	So that's pretty awesome that he's got this challenge kind of gives tips
6560020	6564700	for game developers and how they can do different things for their games
6564700	6570300	to be able to benefit, you know, these other demographics.
6570340	6574500	So, for example, with the designing for disability for deaf and hard of hearing,
6574740	6577980	he says, the thing is about video game subtitles, it's more important
6577980	6581940	than any other medium that they're easy to read because you're trying to divide
6581940	6585500	the your attention between subtitles and everything else you need to think about.
6585820	6589940	So, you know, they have he's got a whole bunch of tips.
6589940	6592940	He's going to be doing this series, I guess, for other aspects as well.
6593340	6595900	And if you want to check it out, you can.
6596220	6599980	And then also he has a picture on, too, if you need to want to support that.
6600500	6605860	But it's pretty neat to give it a look and see what they recommend.
6605860	6611420	But it's neat to see that there's resources out there to talk about accessibility,
6611420	6621060	because it's not really something that's brought up a lot in the game dev video tutorial series world.
6621180	6623940	Yeah, I think that's really cool just to like, you know, a lot of times,
6623940	6626140	99 percent of it is just like awareness.
6626140	6630740	I made that statistic up, but it's just awareness, you know, like, oh,
6631020	6635420	I could do this thing really easily, but if I didn't think to do it, I might not do it.
6635700	6641740	You know, and you can't like you have to put every little thing in a game that you make.
6641740	6644340	You know what I mean? Like what I mean by that is that like,
6644340	6649180	OK, take my reading of the game Tempest 4000 earlier in the show is that like
6649180	6653660	they don't have options in it to like change the resolution or use the mouse
6653860	6657900	or remap the buttons because they just didn't put it in there.
6657900	6658780	You know what I mean?
6658780	6662380	So it's like things like that developers kind of like have to put in their games.
6662620	6666420	And even though it might not necessarily be difficult, I don't know.
6666420	6668780	I don't I don't make a lot of games, but, you know,
6669620	6673260	it's just it's standard practice on PC to do that kind of stuff,
6673260	6674780	even if you don't do it for console.
6674780	6679420	But come on, you got to you got to realize that you're putting this on PC.
6679420	6680580	You can't just like, yeah,
6680580	6683620	let's copy and paste what I did in this other platform, put it out here. It's fine.
6683620	6686060	I know. But anyway, back to the topic at hand with the accessibility for like
6686540	6688020	for the deaf and so forth.
6688020	6692340	Like, I think it's really cool that, you know, to to just build that awareness.
6692380	6695980	And, you know, things to do and, you know, what maybe not to do,
6695980	6699380	what what color patterns might not be as good to use as certain other color
6699380	6702940	patterns to help people with certain color blindness and, you know, things like that.
6702940	6706220	So pretty cool. All right.
6707180	6712780	Let's move on and talk about a unveiling at Comic-Con this past weekend,
6712780	6716340	which is for Mega Man Fully Charged. That's right.
6716340	6719100	The full trailer for Mega Man Fully Charged came out.
6719300	6721860	And now you can check out what's going to be coming to the cartoon.
6721860	6726660	I watched so I watched the trailer and I watched also the episode one trailer.
6726900	6730340	The trailer that they have for the whole series looks like hot shit.
6730460	6731100	Here it is right now.
6731100	6733860	We're going to play it here in studio a little bit, just so,
6733860	6737100	because I want to see Jamie's take on this, too.
6741100	6743740	I don't someone to hate the look
6743740	6746300	completely because it kind of reminds me of Tron,
6746740	6748340	even though it does look a little cheap.
6748340	6750940	It looks very cheap.
6750940	6753620	It does look like it was made on the cheap.
6753620	6756540	I don't know, I think I've watched it.
6756540	6758660	I try it. I try it.
6758660	6760980	And make a perfect decision from there, Jim.
6761500	6767820	So we'll see. Anyway, I can barely hear anything, but I wonder if it's kind of based off the Mega Man EXE or
6767860	6770460	Rockman Battle No. No, it's it's garbage.
6771140	6772780	He's got he's got Micro Man.
6772780	6777340	He's just like this little robot that lives in this helmet that like quips stupid shit.
6777820	6779420	Well, if you want to see for yourself,
6779420	6782900	you can check out a preview on the Cartoon Network app on August 3rd,
6783100	6786540	and then it airs on the actual Cartoon Network on August 5th.
6786660	6789860	They had a preview, though, for like the first episode.
6789860	6794580	They had like a trailer and it and show a little bit more in detail what it was like.
6794580	6799860	And it's not as bad as that trailer, but it still looks bad.
6799900	6805140	I mean, it's just it's the lowest like I don't know, like I get it.
6805140	6807100	It's not supposed to appeal to me.
6807100	6808540	It's supposed to appeal to kids.
6808540	6809420	Kids might be into it?
6810300	6811820	I don't know.
6811820	6814300	I mean, they're into a lot of things like all of a sudden.
6814300	6820940	But like with that in mind, OK, like, for example, they just put out a Captain Underpants cartoon
6820940	6822380	because the movie was kind of funny.
6822380	6824660	My kids read the books and I watched the cartoon.
6824820	6825900	Well, I thought your kids could read.
6826740	6828180	My older kid can.
6828500	6829780	My youngest cannot.
6829780	6831900	OK, my oldest, he can read just fine.
6831900	6835940	OK, no, but like Captain and I read it to them as well.
6835940	6844380	So so we watched the cartoon in the cartoon is for it's structured like the book.
6844380	6846020	And they have like chapters of seven.
6846020	6849700	It's really well animated and it's funny, has good writing.
6851260	6852940	You know that they're into.
6853900	6855700	But this is like kind of dumb.
6855700	6858420	This reminds me of like the Pac-Man cartoon that they had.
6858420	6859660	And it's just as cheap.
6859660	6865380	Look, the animation looks just as cheap or maybe even like if I'm trying to think.
6866940	6868660	What's something else that they like?
6868660	6869380	They like.
6871740	6872540	What's it called? It's.
6876100	6878380	There's another show that is Disney.
6878380	6880340	I think it's Disney.
6880340	6884020	It's they have like three ninjas or whatever.
6884020	6885180	Oh, whatever doesn't matter.
6887260	6888980	But there's there's other cheaper cartoons.
6888980	6893540	It's just I don't think when you see the animation, the animation is kind of cheap and
6893580	6896740	usually when they skimp on the animation like that, they're also skimping on the
6896740	6901740	writing and it's just like it gets tiring after a while and they get bored with it.
6901740	6906340	So unless there's something to really hook them in and make it interesting, I think
6906340	6910260	that it's just going to be kind of it's going to be there and then it's just they're
6910260	6911100	going to stop making it.
6912500	6914540	Whatever, I mean, I'm not going to watch it.
6914540	6916540	It looks dumb. I tried watching.
6916540	6921340	I do like that they do some like flashback stuff when they're talking about different
6921340	6926420	things. It's like in a retro pixelated like sprite.
6926420	6930140	They tell it like sprites and they have like sprite little cut, you know, animations
6930140	6932020	between scenes and stuff like that.
6932140	6933260	So that's neat.
6934020	6935980	But once again, who's that appealing to?
6935980	6939460	Is that supposed to appeal to me, the person that played the video games, or is it
6939460	6940540	supposed to appeal to a kid?
6940540	6941900	Kid doesn't give a shit about that.
6942820	6948340	I don't know. It's just I wish it was written in a way where like it appeals to all
6948340	6950020	audiences because you don't have to.
6950020	6951700	Why are you dumbing it down?
6951700	6953780	You don't have to dumb that shit down for kids.
6954140	6956620	We used to watch the fucking Batman anime series.
6956620	6958860	That wasn't fucking dumbed down for kids.
6959340	6963700	You know, there are Darkwing Dockery, these like DuckTales and shit like I watched.
6963700	6967900	Like my my my favorite shit was the stuff that was like Tiny Toons and Animaniacs.
6967940	6969540	Exactly. True levels of humor.
6969540	6970900	Exactly. Exactly.
6970900	6974060	That was great. But old school Rocky and Bull angle.
6974660	6979340	But nowadays, like even like Mickey Mouse, like my son watches my youngest and watches
6979340	6983620	Mickey Mouse stuff on his tablet, that shit's like fucking SpongeBob.
6983620	6986900	It's like I mean, not to say that SpongeBob is bad, because that's just that peels the
6986900	6989220	stoner people and everybody.
6989220	6990780	I mean, everybody loves SpongeBob, but it's stupid.
6990940	6993220	But it's like not as much as adventure time.
6993220	6995500	Oh, my God. Yes. Like I was so funny.
6995500	6997500	You know, it's like it's like that.
6997500	7000620	And that's fine. But it's not like it's not Mickey Mouse anymore.
7000660	7003620	Nothing makes me want to smoke weed like episodes of Adventure Time.
7004300	7008580	But yeah, but the new Mickey Mouse show is like fucking like Adventure Time or Ren
7008580	7012100	Sippy or something like that. It's just it's just fucking crazy.
7012100	7015740	If you watch that and I don't know, it just is weird.
7016420	7020380	But I guess it's just the demographic nowadays is the kids like that kind of crap.
7020540	7023900	I mean, it's fine. It's more interesting than the other Mickey Mouse cartoons.
7023900	7026060	And the DuckTales and new DuckTales is fucking awesome.
7026620	7028900	But I don't think this is going to be awesome.
7028900	7030420	This is going to be awesome. Like Sonic.
7031060	7032980	What's the Sonic show they have now?
7033220	7035820	That's shit. Sonic hero, Sonic Boom.
7035820	7038540	Yeah. No one gives a shit about Sonic Boom.
7038860	7042180	No one's fucking like, oh, my God, I need to see the new episode of Sonic Boom.
7042180	7045100	I got to get home so I can watch. I got to watch my Sonic Boom.
7045300	7046900	No one fucking cares about that.
7047140	7049580	Like, no one's going to fucking care about this show either.
7050820	7054700	And that's what pisses me off. It's like more Capcom.
7055620	7058820	When you're licensing Mega Man, make it more like Mega Man 11,
7059660	7062780	not fucking bad box Mega Man that was in, you know,
7063660	7064660	the fighting games.
7064660	7068060	But I'm all about new She-Ra that dresses like a normal person.
7068380	7070540	All about that. New She-Ra? Yeah.
7070740	7072260	She wears real fucking armor.
7072260	7074940	Yeah. An actual breastplate, shorts under her skirt.
7074940	7079540	Instead of like a titty plate, she dresses like somebody might actually wear something.
7080300	7084020	So real armor about fucking time.
7084220	7086020	OK, moving on.
7086740	7088380	Let's go to a different type of gaming story.
7088380	7089380	Darcy.
7090860	7095100	Well, I'm sure we've seen an increase of diagnoses with kids with
7095380	7100860	attention problems and kids having trouble with their own anger management.
7102340	7105860	There is a game now, this game came out in November last year,
7106340	7109140	but it's getting a lot more attention.
7109140	7110620	It's called Mightier.
7111100	7115500	And for kids who have issues with anxiety or
7116220	7121860	anger problems, what they do is they have the strap that goes on on their forearm
7122180	7125580	that measures their heart rate and oxygen level.
7126060	7132140	And so the game itself will change based on their heart rate and oxygen level,
7132140	7135140	as in anxiety or stress response.
7135460	7139900	So they actually get rewarded for forcing themselves to calm down,
7139900	7142540	to breathe, to do soothing techniques.
7143060	7148300	So basically, the game is to teach them how to self-regulate their own moods.
7150380	7155420	And actually has been rather lauded by a good series of behavioral pediatricians.
7156500	7159820	Although there are some people who have been pretty much against it,
7159820	7164780	because, you know, it's just more they think that more video games
7164780	7166300	are going to lead to more attention problems.
7166300	7171100	But a lot of kids have found the game because it teaches them this.
7171140	7173300	They are now doing these things in real life,
7173820	7179180	because now they know that it should be a situation that they should calm themselves in.
7179180	7183260	So I think it's actually a pretty good idea that they're now bringing video games into
7183260	7184340	modern psychology.
7184660	7185660	I think it's really awesome.
7189140	7190820	Yeah, that was my story.
7191940	7196620	Cool. What do you think maybe we can take from this for,
7196980	7200460	like, I guess, if you will, mainstream development of games?
7200660	7204700	Well, I think that the same techniques could be applied toward adults, for one thing.
7208780	7209980	I think that...
7212900	7213900	Well, see, I don't know.
7213900	7216340	It makes me think that if we had the Vitality sensor,
7216860	7219820	if that had come out, Nintendo would have done more things like that, too.
7219820	7223220	You know, it's kind of an old concept if you think about it.
7223220	7229420	But I think that if it helps, I think kids with all of these issues
7229420	7231740	become better members of society.
7231740	7237300	Who knows? It could also inspire, you know, more games to help with, you know, social issues
7237300	7241020	or, you know, or even going back to the accessibility issues, you know,
7241020	7245540	thinking in terms of using these as tools and not just as entertainment.
7245900	7249140	Helping these kids to be the future creators.
7249580	7250220	Something like that.
7250220	7250940	Yeah, I like that.
7251660	7256020	In chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Captain Spike says, wow, this is an awesome idea.
7256580	7259340	Dungeon Buster in chat says, there's an article I found on the net
7259340	7263340	of an old, old game mag from the early 80s that interviewed a psychologist
7263340	7268620	who used wizardry to help patients like children get out of their shells and socialize.
7268860	7274140	Wizardry as in the Sir Tech game, not like, you know, like Harry Potter.
7274140	7275060	You're a wizard, Harry.
7275060	7277100	Not like that, like the actual game wizardry.
7277100	7279220	If you remember that from back in the day, that's pretty cool.
7279980	7281540	All right. Just a few more stories for you guys.
7281540	7284180	Then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio.
7284180	7285700	All one word on Skype.
7285700	7287100	First, Loki.
7287100	7289780	All right. So there's a new Famicom game coming out.
7289900	7291860	It's not exactly new.
7291860	7294220	It's not not new, new, as you will.
7294220	7299220	But it's basically a Japanese port of the game Battle Kid.
7299500	7304860	And for those not familiar with Battle Kid, Battle Kid is an insanely fucking hard game
7305220	7307700	that looks very much like I want to be the guy.
7307940	7311460	In fact, you know, the main character looks exactly like we want to be the guy.
7311660	7314140	But it plays more like Mega Man.
7314700	7318860	So, you know, they have released this.
7318860	7323020	Originally, it was on an NES cartridge in 2010, and now it's actually making its way
7323020	7324020	to the Famicom as well.
7324220	7327060	So they've done a few things with the Japanese version.
7327060	7329900	So the, of course, translation.
7330180	7335940	They also switched to hit points instead of one hit deaths, which I find interesting
7335940	7337740	because that's the whole point of the game.
7337740	7341100	It's supposed to be fucking hard and one hit deaths, but whatever.
7341700	7348140	They have a life counter, added some new checkpoints, added a new boss, new stage,
7348140	7354060	new sound effects, 11 new music tracks, doubled the ROM size and changed the movement
7354060	7355660	attack patterns of some of the enemies.
7356260	7357420	So pretty cool.
7357980	7360340	And that's going to be that actually came out.
7361660	7364780	Yeah, it's supposed to be released in Japan September of this year.
7364980	7366980	Nice. All right.
7366980	7369660	Well, one more story for you guys out of Comic-Con and then we're going to get to our
7369660	7371700	Skypline at Orange Lounge Radio.
7371700	7376900	But if you're a big fan of Overwatch and you're a big fan of Nerf, we're going to be
7376900	7383260	very happy because they are releasing official Overwatch Nerf blasters.
7383900	7388340	This particular first one that's coming out is modeled after Reaper's weapon in
7388340	7391260	Overwatch. So it's these little like hand shotgun things.
7391540	7395140	But yeah, now you can get a Nerf version of this.
7395140	7398140	Nerf is partnering with Blizzard on the official Overwatch Nerf gun.
7398380	7401900	The Nerf Rival Overwatch Reaper White Edition.
7402300	7404100	It's due in 2019.
7404300	7406180	It mimics the look of the shotgun.
7406380	7409100	But obviously the functionality is a little bit different.
7410140	7414500	You get eight little Nerf rounds for this and there's a ready indicator and a safety
7414500	7415580	lock with this.
7416820	7420980	So, Dartusy in chat says, I don't play Overwatch, but that is really cool in my
7420980	7425660	opinion. Yeah, you don't have to play Overwatch to understand a Nerf gun.
7426140	7427820	So it's pretty cool.
7427980	7430780	So no pricing has been announced yet.
7430820	7434700	I'm sure it's probably not going to be very cheap, but it probably won't be too crazy
7434700	7437180	either. So who knows what will come after this?
7437180	7441740	Will they do weapons based off, you know, Soldier 76's weapon or Tracer's guns or
7441740	7443540	what? We'll see what happens.
7443780	7448500	So anyway, we'll see what comes of this Hasbro partnership a little later on.
7450100	7454140	All right. Anyhow, with that, we are going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge
7454140	7455860	Radio, all one word on Skype.
7455860	7459020	If you want to give us a call to talk about anything that we've talked about tonight or
7459020	7462820	maybe something that we missed, we're happy to take your call right now.
7463220	7467300	While we wait to see if anybody calls in, Loki, any other stories that we didn't get to
7467300	7468580	tonight? Some last minute stories?
7471420	7475180	I feel like it was I mean, even though we had Comic-Con this weekend, which is a big
7475180	7480980	deal, it's not obviously there is stuff during the week that like I saw and I'm like, I
7480980	7484500	know I'm going to forget that come Sunday and I didn't write it down.
7484540	7487860	And I know there's other things that happened that were like pretty significant.
7487900	7491860	And I'm just like I even went back to them, like looking for that stuff.
7491860	7495100	And I know one of them was that whole the AI thing, which we talked about.
7495900	7498180	But there is another thing, too, and I can't remember.
7499620	7504860	What it was. Oh, well, I guess it's not a huge thing that there was the two countries.
7504900	7509900	I can't remember which countries that European countries now that had issue with the
7509900	7519100	loot boxes in Counter-Strike go that they actually removed loot boxes out of those
7519100	7525300	regions because of the whole laws regarding it, because they're going to face a bunch
7525300	7529180	of fines in regards to the loot boxes being gambling.
7529180	7533900	So I know that that was a thing, but that's kind of minor.
7534260	7537700	But it is interesting to see that they're having to take action for that stuff already.
7538140	7542580	Um, but yeah, a whole lot of news, a lot of Comic-Con stuff, lots of movies.
7542620	7544780	Yeah, a lot of that's movie movie talk, though.
7544780	7548980	Any well, let's let's allow ourselves to deviate a little bit here to some of the other
7548980	7551100	nerd stuff. Any of the nerd stuff out of Comic-Con?
7551100	7555500	Catch your eye. I'm surprised that the Aquaman trailer looked pretty good.
7555500	7559580	I don't really like DC stuff too much anymore, but the Aquaman trailer looked awesome.
7559580	7561740	And then, of course, Godzilla, King of the Monster.
7562460	7566380	That's awesome. It looks so well with a kid from Stranger Things in it, huh?
7566380	7568740	Yeah, but it just looks so good.
7568740	7571620	And then Glass looks interesting.
7571660	7572620	I want to see that.
7574900	7576700	I can't think of what else I saw.
7577380	7581220	I am excited, of course, to see the new Invader Zim movie whenever that comes out.
7581940	7584380	It looks very much Invader Zim.
7585420	7591580	Just sad that that's all there is, is just the movie, not rebooting a new show or anything.
7591580	7593020	Yeah, but whatever.
7593020	7597060	Um. Yeah, I don't know.
7597380	7598740	I mean, that's pretty much it.
7598740	7601380	Oh, yeah, they have the Voltron Lego set coming out.
7601420	7602980	They were selling it at Comic-Con.
7602980	7605140	Yeah, that's coming out on August 1st.
7605140	7608340	I still need to put together my Tron light bike that I finally bought at the Lego store.
7608340	7609140	Yeah, I really need to.
7609700	7611180	Very, very, very quick build.
7611220	7612340	Yeah. Oh, yeah, I'm sure.
7612340	7614220	I'm sure. But cool.
7614540	7616220	We still haven't put together our DeLorean.
7617140	7618940	Oh, would you get like an official two of them?
7618980	7619580	Oh, cool.
7619580	7622500	Oh, God, that thing's like that's pretty old now.
7622540	7626900	I know we have a couple of them just because Dan wanted one to build and one to keep in the box.
7626900	7628780	So I like that.
7630420	7637180	God, whenever I think of Lego, I think like Toys R Us and how, you know, they all went under because a lot of people were trying to get the deals and the Legos and stuff.
7637180	7643020	But like, we haven't seen what's going to go in at any of those old retail places on like a lot of these stores.
7643020	7648300	Halloween costume shop whenever, you know, spirit is where I buy all my house decorations.
7649220	7650940	But it's like they're everywhere.
7650940	7654100	And so it's like, oh, boy, last thing we need is another one of those.
7654100	7655900	I don't know. But that's fine.
7656100	7657820	Yeah, I don't know what they would put in there.
7657820	7660220	I mean, I don't know.
7660220	7662260	I'm waiting to hear about KB coming back.
7662740	7664940	We need some Sears closed down.
7665100	7666300	There are local Sears.
7666300	7667820	Oh, the one at Sunrise.
7667820	7670540	That's gone. Oh, that's completely gone.
7670540	7671860	I mean, I get it.
7671860	7675220	It's not like I'm crying, but like I'm like, what's left of that mall?
7675220	7676740	It's pretty empty.
7677220	7678860	They have a toy store.
7678860	7683580	It's like a mostly a board game store, but they have toys there.
7683580	7685260	It's just kind of lame.
7685380	7695060	I think that you finally you find like stuff now at places like BoxLunch or the box lunch that we used to have up here close to the one in our fairs there.
7695420	7697660	The one up in there was one in Pladio, I think.
7697700	7700180	Oh, wow. The Arden Fair ones like nice and big.
7700260	7701700	We got a call coming in. So let's get to it.
7701700	7703100	Hi, you're on Orange Laundry. Who's this?
7703660	7704820	What's going on? It's Rama.
7705020	7706180	Hey, Rama, what's up, buddy?
7707180	7709820	Do I sound a lot better than the last time I called in?
7709820	7710860	You do sound a lot better.
7710860	7713060	Your volume is stabilizing a little bit, but that's normal.
7713060	7713780	What's on your mind, buddy?
7714700	7716700	Well, a couple of things I want to mention.
7716700	7719620	And on a side note, I got on an Amazon deal thing.
7719620	7721380	I got a brand new mic for like 60 bucks.
7721380	7722340	I'm kind of happy about that.
7722340	7723860	Shoot. There you go. Good news.
7723860	7726180	Good news. What's up, my friend?
7727420	7733300	We were talking earlier about antenna TV and VTV, and I'm kind of thankful because I can get them on my...
7733300	7737460	Hey, buddy, you suddenly like your volume drops significantly.
7737460	7740660	I don't know if you moved away from your mic or something, but like we can't hear your question.
7741540	7742500	Can you hear me now?
7742500	7743420	Yes, we can, sir.
7743900	7746780	All right. This microphone is extra sensitive from what I can tell.
7746780	7747380	Interesting.
7748540	7758580	But what I was saying was antenna TV, VTV, it's not just available over the air, but depending on your local cable provider, you can catch them that way, too.
7758740	7759900	Yes, some of them.
7759900	7763700	Some of the channels are so cheap that cable doesn't even bother to pick them up.
7763980	7766700	But you're right. Some of those channels are on your local cable.
7766700	7775300	But, you know, with more and more people that are cord cutting these days, it is still pretty impressive what you can pick up with an antenna.
7775620	7787140	If you're willing to watch old stuff, you know, some people aren't interested in watching, you know, old reruns of Mama's Family, which to those people, I say, boo, because, you know.
7787380	7801140	But anyway, but, you know, there's a lot of stuff that you can pick up with an antenna these days, especially, but in a place like New York City or something, it's probably even doubly so than, you know, a more remote part of the country.
7801140	7806780	I wouldn't call Sacramento remote, but, you know, we probably still don't have as many channels over the air as you guys have.
7807540	7814580	Well, I mean, being here in New York City, I can pick up stations like in Southern Connecticut, per se.
7814580	7816020	So that's not so bad.
7816020	7833500	Right now, if you're in North Jersey, you're going to get the regular New York City stations down by where Makochon lives and where Ari lives, if they went to OTA antenna, actually more where Ari lives, he could pick up the local Philly affiliated stations.
7833540	7843180	Oh, wow. I remember as a kid when we used to like, if you could aim the antenna like just the right way, you could get Fox out of the Bay Area.
7844180	7849900	Yes. Yes. Yes. Because I remember for a short period of time, this defined all logic.
7849900	7861940	I was able to pull a station in from like New Hampshire and I'm like, it's got to be bouncing off of a local affiliate or something like that because it was staticky and I could see the call symbols and stuff like that.
7862100	7872300	But, you know, kids, kids today will never understand having to sift through the static to see these or or even better yet when you're trying to watch Cinemax when you didn't pay for it.
7872300	7880260	And it's like, I think I saw a boob in like a wavy green type of filter.
7881180	7890580	I remember when we first got cable in our town and there was there was a remote, but it was a wired box and it wasn't numbers.
7890580	7894100	It was number so you got the 13 and then it was letters.
7894100	7895620	So you're telling the dial.
7895660	7899220	I just remember it being at my cousin's house at Nickelodeon was Channel K.
7899300	7901180	That was the main thing that I really cared about.
7901180	7915980	I remember I remember that I was I remember that and I remember I remember in the mid 80s like we had a cable thing here was it was like Jones cable or something or it was in Roseville where I grew up before like Comcast bought them all out.
7916260	7927020	They had like a thing on they had a service like in the mid 80s where you could like download games to your TV and play these games on your like remote.
7927700	7933620	And this was like way before this became commonplace in like the day and age of apps.
7933860	7936980	So like, I don't know why that didn't really catch on more.
7936980	7939820	But like, I remember thinking that was, you know, it's way ahead of its time.
7943380	7945260	Yeah, crazy stuff anyway.
7945740	7946260	All right.
7946820	7949860	Well, my friend, is there anything else you want to share with us or?
7950540	7951220	One thing.
7951420	7951820	Yeah.
7951820	7955540	If Uchon does Maria, you have to do Prince Peach.
7956540	7957580	I'm open to that.
7957580	7958260	That'll be fun.
7958700	7962740	You have to throw the fish out and just dye it a nice peach pinkish color.
7962820	7963900	You will look so boss.
7964060	7967500	Well, maybe maybe I want to be Prince Rose-lin.
7967500	7970340	I don't I don't know how to boyify that name, but who cares?
7971500	7972900	Oh, Ross-lin.
7974060	7976020	You could just be like Prince Ross.
7976060	7977300	Yeah, yeah, Prince Ross.
7977460	7983380	Or maybe I want to be instead of Daisy, I would be Daniel, I guess.
7983420	7984020	Daffodil.
7986220	7990580	I think that you've got to get Allen in on this and you got to go to Uchon.
7990700	7993940	The fangirls would lose their shit, especially if they see the wedding rings.
7993980	7998500	OK, I kind of love the idea of Allen and I both doing it.
7998500	8000980	And one of us is Peach and the other one is Daisy.
8001420	8001920	Yes.
8002340	8003700	That that might have to happen.
8005740	8008580	If it does, I may have to fly out for that convention.
8008580	8009420	Seriously.
8009420	8011380	Yeah, I think it might be.
8011380	8013420	Well, you have Prince Peach and Duke Daisy.
8013420	8015700	It might be better if either way around.
8015700	8019180	I know it might be better if I'm Daisy, though, because like J.D. says in chat.
8019380	8020700	Hi, I'm Daisy.
8022300	8023820	I have to go around the con.
8024060	8025300	Hi, I'm Daisy.
8027260	8028780	And I don't think Allen would want to do that.
8029180	8029700	All right.
8030380	8033860	Anyway, but I think Allen would be more than happy to say Peach is the winner.
8034180	8036700	All right. Anyway, I'm going to let you go, my friend.
8036700	8037900	But thank you so much for the call.
8038420	8039620	No problem. I'll take care.
8039660	8040980	Bye, I'm Daisy.
8043860	8045180	Oh, my God, I'm dying.
8046060	8049660	J.D. in chat says, swear to God, Super Smash Ultimate had better have.
8049900	8051580	Hi, I'm Daisy. Be a taunt.
8051580	8053500	Oh, if it's not, return it.
8053500	8054860	Throw it in the trash.
8054860	8058060	If it's not an actual time in the game, it better, it better.
8058620	8059660	All right.
8059660	8061220	We're going to go ahead and close up Skype for now.
8061220	8063540	If you didn't get through, you want to say something to us.
8063540	8064380	You can always email us.
8064380	8066980	Participate at orange lounge radio dot com.
8066980	8069220	I bet they're going to have the rapids in there.
8069220	8072700	They might. I that would because then they could do like as a character,
8072900	8074340	you know, costumes.
8074340	8078820	Yeah, they have all the weird like rabbits that they have in the Mario Kingdom battle,
8078980	8082940	which is another game that my son has played that I still haven't played yet
8082940	8084700	because the Mario Kingdom. Yeah, we have.
8084700	8086380	Well, we just haven't played it. All right.
8086380	8088100	I haven't played it. He's played it.
8088100	8091020	Well, we're going to wrap up another episode of Orange Lounge Radio with that.

8104300	8105900	So, yeah, tell a friend.
8105900	8109740	Leave a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Google Play podcast
8109740	8111660	or wherever it is you found this show.
8111660	8114140	Those go a really long way. Let me tell you.
8114140	8117460	And I know I say that every week, but it seems like nobody ever does it.
8117460	8121180	So please, you know, if you have five seconds to help us out,
8121420	8123860	I really, really, really appreciate it.
8123860	8125820	So that's going to do it.
8125820	8127740	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
8127740	8128860	Dark Sakura, I'll start with you.
8129860	8131380	Wasps suck.
8131380	8136220	I got stung in the chin by the same two wasps and had allergic reactions, of course.
8136220	8139100	And that was a week and a half ago.
8139100	8140900	And it looks like it's finally starting to heal.
8140900	8143340	But now it's peeling and it hurts.
8143340	8146660	Wasps are assholes.
8146660	8148660	And vote.
8148660	8152940	My final thought is I had a really good time going out randomly last night,
8152940	8157100	but I have to remind myself that I still can get hangovers.
8157140	8160180	And thank God mine went away before the show tonight.
8160180	8161740	Loki, your final thought tonight?
8161740	8167180	Uh, wasps like making nests at our house and I like spraying them with poison.
8168060	8169860	So there's that.
8169860	8172180	Hooray for poison.
8172980	8174140	All right. That's it.
8174140	8175500	That's going to do it for another episode.
8175500	8178140	We'll see you in seven days to do it all again.
