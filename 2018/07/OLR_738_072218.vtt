00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
It's the year of the remaster, the year of the Switch port, the year of the vinyl soundtrack, the year of the battle royale, another year of Mega Man Classic, and the year of the doll.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
I'm a year older, as was this show last month. Stay tuned for all this year's news, or at least this week's, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:39.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio live tonight.

00:39.000 --> 00:52.000
Episode number 738 for this July 22nd of 2018. Here to talk about video games with y'all assembled in our live chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

00:52.000 --> 01:00.000
We do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com

01:00.000 --> 01:07.000
But you podcast folks out there can participate with us as well throughout the week, through your emails, your tweets, and so forth.

01:07.000 --> 01:14.000
But tonight here in studio, it's me, Rob Roberts, or Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E, joined as always by DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
You could go Skie!

01:17.000 --> 01:25.000
Actually, I'm giving serious thought to changing my Twitter name off of Skie, just because I don't really use that name at all.

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
The reason why that name comes from, like DDR Freak, like years ago, but I don't really use that name anywhere anymore.

01:32.000 --> 01:43.000
So, you know, because of things like this show that started after the DDR Freak days, or during really, I think people just know me online as Rob Roberts at this point.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
So, you know, I probably should have some type of...

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
JD says don't do it because four-letter usernames on Twitter are rare.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
That is true. I think if I do switch it, I will probably keep a sock account.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Because the name I really want is Rob Roberts, but a spammer has it.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
So my thought is I'm going to hold the Skie account hostage until Rob Roberts is released.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
That's my Twitter thinking right now.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
I'm always going to keep DarkSakura because people hate me for it.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Why?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Like complete strangers.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
You've got the name I want!

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Good!

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
On Twitter, aren't you underscore O-L-R?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
No.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
No? Okay.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
No.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
I couldn't remember.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
I'm DarkSakura there because I made that account when Twitter was new.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah, we all got on Twitter pretty quick.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
Because, well, if you think a four-letter account is rare, follow the show on Twitter, O-L-R.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
We have a three-letter account there and we constantly get tweets for like other things.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
It's pretty funny.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Fuck off.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Yeah.

02:34.000 --> 02:41.320
But I still, though my other one Kuro Tsubasa is, I decided because I actually was spelling

02:41.320 --> 02:45.000
Kuro incorrectly for black, it just means crowing.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Mm-hmm.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
So.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Works.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.240
Sorry about last week.

02:49.240 --> 02:52.240
We weren't here last week and that was completely my fault.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.180
Without getting into all the gory details, I had food poisoning.

02:55.180 --> 02:56.180
It was awful.

02:56.180 --> 02:57.180
Y'all have been there.

02:57.180 --> 02:59.960
I don't need to say anything else about it.

02:59.960 --> 03:00.960
But I'm fine now.

03:00.960 --> 03:07.360
Like most episodes of that sort of thing, by the time 48 hours had passed, it was like

03:07.360 --> 03:08.560
nothing had ever happened.

03:08.560 --> 03:12.680
So it's just unfortunate that fell on Sunday night because I hate missing episodes.

03:12.680 --> 03:15.120
I hate not being here for y'all.

03:15.120 --> 03:19.000
But I know you all are understanding very much as well and I hope you found some other

03:19.000 --> 03:24.500
good indie shows to listen to last Sunday night or maybe some Twitch streamers and probably

03:24.500 --> 03:25.700
played some games.

03:25.700 --> 03:28.260
I know there's a lot of you playing a lot of different games right now.

03:28.260 --> 03:32.020
We'll get into some of those during our gaming weeks in a minute, but I also have to introduce,

03:32.020 --> 03:33.860
of course, Techmaster Loki.

03:33.860 --> 03:34.860
How are you, Loki?

03:34.860 --> 03:35.860
I'm fine.

03:35.860 --> 03:36.860
Good.

03:36.860 --> 03:39.020
I had a mediocre sandwich from Subway.

03:39.020 --> 03:41.980
Yeah, well, Subway sandwiches tend to be pretty mediocre, but that's just my opinion.

03:41.980 --> 03:45.340
I should have just gone with the one that's by my work because they know what I want there

03:45.340 --> 03:49.340
and they don't even, they're like, you just have the same thing as normal?

03:49.340 --> 03:50.340
Yeah.

03:50.340 --> 03:51.340
It comes out perfect.

03:51.340 --> 03:58.060
Like this one was just like 80% bread and like nothing and she just like slapped everything

03:58.060 --> 04:02.260
on there and it's just, I could tell she was making like, this is going to be terrible.

04:02.260 --> 04:03.740
Is it the Subway right near here?

04:03.740 --> 04:04.740
Cause they're really bad.

04:04.740 --> 04:07.780
No, it's the one right off the freeway by my house.

04:07.780 --> 04:08.780
Okay.

04:08.780 --> 04:09.780
Okay.

04:09.780 --> 04:10.780
Oh yeah.

04:10.780 --> 04:11.780
I made a last minute change in what I wanted to get.

04:11.780 --> 04:17.620
And I got, I went originally into Cafe Rio and then I was like, I'm confused at the calories

04:17.620 --> 04:24.260
of all the chips and salsa they eat on there because the online, it says it's 440 calories

04:24.260 --> 04:25.260
on their menu board.

04:25.260 --> 04:27.260
It says it's 1,340 calories.

04:27.260 --> 04:30.380
So I'm like, that's a big discrepancy.

04:30.380 --> 04:31.380
Depends how much you eat.

04:31.380 --> 04:32.380
I suppose.

04:32.380 --> 04:36.100
Um, that subway, I think that you're talking about is right by where I used to work and

04:36.100 --> 04:40.460
without giving away my whole life story here, but that used to be a Quiznos when it first

04:40.460 --> 04:41.460
opened.

04:41.460 --> 04:42.460
Oh man.

04:42.460 --> 04:43.460
Can you say downgrade?

04:43.460 --> 04:45.460
I would rather be a Quiznos.

04:45.460 --> 04:46.460
Are there any of those still around?

04:46.460 --> 04:47.460
No, I miss those.

04:47.460 --> 04:48.460
Those are good anyway.

04:48.460 --> 04:51.940
We used to have one right around the corner from my house and I used to go there all the

04:51.940 --> 04:52.940
time.

04:52.940 --> 04:56.700
Meanwhile, while the rest of you are mourning Toys R Us and shit.

04:56.700 --> 04:59.380
I'm sitting here going, I miss my Quiznos sandwich.

04:59.380 --> 05:00.460
My toasted sandwiches.

05:00.460 --> 05:03.500
I, I'm like the only person that loved that toasted thing.

05:03.500 --> 05:06.620
Everybody else is like, it was good, but then they'll toast it.

05:06.620 --> 05:07.620
Subway stolen.

05:07.620 --> 05:09.380
You give it subway though.

05:09.380 --> 05:13.540
You toast their sandwich and it's still, it's still garbage toasted a sandwich like you

05:13.540 --> 05:15.100
would like you would bake a pizza.

05:15.100 --> 05:16.620
It went through that slow conveyor belt.

05:16.620 --> 05:20.420
It was all, yeah, it like it was good and like they put like, you know, I'd get a steak

05:20.420 --> 05:25.020
sandwich and I had, you know, the Rosemary Parmesan bread with the nice sauce and like

05:25.020 --> 05:29.740
drool and the onions and everything and then come through and you're just like, I don't

05:29.740 --> 05:32.860
need you to do anything that sandwiches cut in half and it's ready to go.

05:32.860 --> 05:36.300
It's just, it's perfect, but that is beautiful.

05:36.300 --> 05:39.900
The problem is it was like I take that sandwich and I go to subway and there is no amount

05:39.900 --> 05:43.940
of sandwich that they could give me that would equal to that sandwich.

05:43.940 --> 05:45.500
It's just, it's not the same.

05:45.500 --> 05:48.460
So I, yeah, it's unfortunate.

05:48.460 --> 05:49.460
All right.

05:49.460 --> 05:52.700
Uh, enough food talk, but it wouldn't be OLR if we didn't deviate into food talk at some

05:52.700 --> 05:53.700
point.

05:53.700 --> 05:58.380
So now we get into our kickoff topic, which as we usually do after a week off is getting

05:58.380 --> 06:00.820
into what we missed the week before.

06:00.820 --> 06:05.340
But um, let me quickly ask, did you guys do anything with the extra time on Sunday since

06:05.340 --> 06:08.540
I know, I saw her, I had to do it kind of last minute, but y'all know how it is.

06:08.540 --> 06:12.500
So did you guys get to do anything fun with your extra unexpected Sunday night off?

06:12.500 --> 06:15.260
I played Pokemon go and saw ant man and wasp.

06:15.260 --> 06:16.260
Okay, cool.

06:16.260 --> 06:18.640
I figured, I figured some Pokemon go might happen.

06:18.640 --> 06:21.620
I stayed in my pajama, not wearing any pants.

06:21.620 --> 06:22.620
Nice.

06:22.620 --> 06:28.460
And then watched, uh, like videos on a YouTube fan fell down a YouTube hole.

06:28.460 --> 06:33.880
That's, that's always a fun way to waste the same thing yesterday is great because I had

06:33.880 --> 06:40.880
an unexpected Saturday off because my schedule, my work, our schedules are start on Saturday.

06:40.880 --> 06:46.740
So because I'm now on a training schedule for another department, yes, um, I had yesterday

06:46.740 --> 06:47.740
off.

06:47.740 --> 06:48.740
Nice.

06:48.740 --> 06:51.740
And that's why I get to be for a whole show just about tonight.

06:51.860 --> 06:52.860
Yay.

06:52.860 --> 06:53.860
Exciting.

06:53.860 --> 06:54.860
All right.

06:54.860 --> 06:56.620
Uh, let's get into some of the topics for the show.

06:56.620 --> 07:01.460
So let's talk about some of the news that we missed last week when we were unexpectedly

07:01.460 --> 07:02.460
off.

07:02.460 --> 07:07.620
So, uh, talking about some Nintendo news, um, apparently, uh, Nintendo had made a comment

07:07.620 --> 07:11.820
about they're not yet at the point where they can announce the entire product lineup for

07:11.820 --> 07:12.820
the autumn.

07:12.820 --> 07:16.140
That was a quote that came out, which seems very strange because autumn is exactly not

07:16.140 --> 07:17.140
that far away.

07:17.140 --> 07:18.140
Now.

07:18.140 --> 07:20.860
We talked about this a little bit at the tail end of Bobby black will show on the call.

07:20.980 --> 07:22.900
I do want to repeat a little bit of it.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.460
Usually I would just tell you, you need to go listen to it to hear it.

07:25.460 --> 07:27.580
But I think part of what we discussed there was really important.

07:27.580 --> 07:29.060
I do need to repeat it.

07:29.060 --> 07:34.940
Um, because my theory on this whole, why Nintendo is waiting forever on this online thing is

07:34.940 --> 07:40.020
that I think Nintendo is really pushing to get something really big out.

07:40.020 --> 07:41.360
That's going to be digital only.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.820
So and I, I think I talked about last show we were here.

07:43.820 --> 07:48.300
I thought something like NES remix, but maybe bigger, something that's going to be download

07:48.300 --> 07:52.940
only that is going to be a big flagship thing for the online service and that they're really

07:52.940 --> 07:54.100
trying to push to get that out.

07:54.100 --> 07:57.860
And actually dark soccer, you said animal crossing, um, as kind of like an offhanded

07:57.860 --> 07:58.860
comment.

07:58.860 --> 08:02.660
And I was kind of like, well, I don't know if it would be that big, but at the same time,

08:02.660 --> 08:07.640
I don't necessarily think that's a, that's a completely off base projection, you know,

08:07.640 --> 08:11.140
because I would think animal crossing is something that maybe deserves a retail release in a

08:11.140 --> 08:18.860
box, but animal cross crossing would also make a really great, like online only download

08:18.860 --> 08:19.860
type of thing.

08:19.860 --> 08:22.660
So I don't hate that idea actually at all.

08:22.660 --> 08:27.420
I'd like an animal crossing MMO and that, and that could be something that, you know,

08:27.420 --> 08:28.420
is pushing the online.

08:28.420 --> 08:31.100
Anyway, my point is with this whole thing, whatever it is that they're working, because

08:31.100 --> 08:32.540
I don't want to get people's hopes up either.

08:32.540 --> 08:33.680
Oh, it's animal crossing.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.680
Maybe not.

08:34.680 --> 08:37.100
It could be, you know, again, think along the lines of NES remix, something you just

08:37.100 --> 08:38.380
haven't thought of yet.

08:39.140 --> 08:43.940
But my thought is that they are really aggressively trying to get that out by October, but right

08:43.940 --> 08:46.740
now Nintendo is in a phase where they're not sure if they're going to make it.

08:46.740 --> 08:51.220
So if they don't make it, then expect that Nintendo direct to be, Oh, it's the online

08:51.220 --> 08:53.100
classics and some little things.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.620
And we're all going to be sitting here going, that's it.

08:55.620 --> 08:56.740
That's what we were waiting for.

08:56.740 --> 09:00.500
But the hype of playing classics online will be kind of cool.

09:00.500 --> 09:04.780
But if Nintendo is able to make the timeline, then we'll get something really big.

09:04.780 --> 09:07.700
But if they miss October, obviously this big thing would just slip into 2019.

09:07.700 --> 09:08.700
We'd get it eventually.

09:08.700 --> 09:09.700
I'd be more curious.

09:09.700 --> 09:14.540
So which games are actually going to use online services because the, how many online, there's

09:14.540 --> 09:16.220
all a whole ton of online games.

09:16.220 --> 09:20.620
I think I'm well, Splatoon two and a smash brothers obviously going to be the huge one

09:20.620 --> 09:24.940
smash brothers when they're expecting everybody to use rocket league and Mario Kart eight

09:24.940 --> 09:25.940
is on card eight.

09:25.940 --> 09:26.940
Maybe a Fortnite.

09:26.940 --> 09:27.940
Fortnite.

09:27.940 --> 09:28.940
Absolutely.

09:28.940 --> 09:29.940
Fortnite.

09:29.940 --> 09:30.940
Yeah.

09:30.940 --> 09:34.260
So, um, yeah, there's, if you really sit down, I mean, maybe not Zelda, breath of the wild

09:34.260 --> 09:37.980
and Mario Odyssey so much, although Mario Odyssey does have the online leaderboards,

09:37.980 --> 09:41.380
but um, you know, maybe not that stuff so much, but there's a fair amount of Nintendo

09:41.380 --> 09:45.400
houses that are using the online.

09:45.400 --> 09:48.660
So anyway, um, some other things that we missed while we were gone.

09:48.660 --> 09:53.940
Speaking of Splatoon two, there was a big, uh, 3.2 0 update with some bug fixes and some

09:53.940 --> 09:56.580
weapon and sub tweaks, uh, that happened.

09:56.580 --> 10:01.660
Uh, let's see the eighties arcade platformer Toki is getting a switch release and a wooden

10:01.660 --> 10:03.540
arcade cabinet to go with that.

10:03.540 --> 10:04.540
Hmm.

10:04.540 --> 10:09.500
Uh, Reggie Fils-Aime talked about the super Mario movie and potential other partnerships.

10:09.500 --> 10:14.500
Uh, in an interview with IGN, he said quotes like, certainly our focus from a Nintendo

10:14.500 --> 10:18.380
perspective as well as working with such an accomplished partner like illumination is

10:18.380 --> 10:22.300
to make sure that what is created is something both fans will love as well as it will be

10:22.300 --> 10:27.020
a great introduction to folks who are not as familiar with the world of Mario.

10:27.020 --> 10:31.060
So most of that is smoke and mirrors, hype chat, but the interesting part of that to

10:31.060 --> 10:36.180
me is that they are making a movie that is geared towards people who may not know who

10:36.180 --> 10:46.080
Mario is, which to me at this point, who doesn't know who Mario is like everybody, especially

10:46.080 --> 10:49.620
our age and younger knows who Mario is.

10:49.620 --> 10:53.940
Even most folks, probably about 10 years older than us, you know, so we're talking about

10:53.940 --> 10:58.540
like maybe when you start to get to like the 65 and older, they don't, that's all my kids

10:58.540 --> 11:04.220
do is they watch, I literally, my kids watch super Mario Odyssey playthroughs all the

11:04.220 --> 11:05.220
time.

11:05.220 --> 11:08.260
I'm like, I asked him once, I'm like, why though?

11:08.260 --> 11:09.320
Cause you beat the game.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.340
So why are you watching people play the game?

11:11.340 --> 11:12.580
I'm like, that doesn't make any sense.

11:12.580 --> 11:15.500
But my youngest son who's not very good at the game, he's just watching people play the

11:15.500 --> 11:19.980
game and yeah, I really can't say anything about that cause that's all I do on Twitch.

11:19.980 --> 11:20.980
I watch people play games.

11:20.980 --> 11:22.500
Are they watching Mario marathon?

11:22.500 --> 11:24.980
No, they're watching just Mario Odyssey.

11:24.980 --> 11:29.780
They want random YouTubers, whoever comes up in the YouTube kids apps, which I don't

11:29.780 --> 11:34.580
even know how it picks up Mario Odyssey cause I don't think that they're actually typing

11:34.580 --> 11:35.580
anything in.

11:35.580 --> 11:40.620
That's the, that's the YouTube market I should have aimed for to try to get more people to

11:40.620 --> 11:44.820
actually subscribe to my channel so I could, you know, like actually make money on Twitch

11:44.820 --> 11:49.340
is like, I should do play throughs aimed at kids and use crazy voices.

11:49.340 --> 11:51.940
No, it's not the crazy voices or anything.

11:51.940 --> 11:53.980
It's literally just the game that they're playing.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.680
It's not a YouTube app.

11:55.680 --> 12:03.100
It's just basically if you have to think dumber because no, no, I'm not saying that kids are

12:03.100 --> 12:04.100
dumb.

12:04.100 --> 12:06.540
I'm saying they don't like at that age, they don't know how to read.

12:06.540 --> 12:08.340
They don't like, my son doesn't know how to read.

12:08.340 --> 12:10.660
I mean he can sometimes recognize stuff, but he doesn't know how to read.

12:10.660 --> 12:15.460
He goes off pictures and so sure, you know, he likes Mario Odyssey because you know, his

12:15.460 --> 12:18.980
brother plays it and I play it and he liked, he plays it too.

12:18.980 --> 12:22.420
And he sees a picture, Oh, Mario brothers and clicks on the picture and then that's

12:22.420 --> 12:23.420
it.

12:23.860 --> 12:25.400
He can't be a streamer in another language.

12:25.400 --> 12:29.660
He doesn't, he can't understand a thing they're saying, but he's watching it because it's

12:29.660 --> 12:31.420
Mario and then he wants to watch Mario.

12:31.420 --> 12:32.420
Okay.

12:32.420 --> 12:36.140
But I mean, I feel like you told this exact same story a year ago, but it was Minecraft.

12:36.140 --> 12:37.780
Well, they still do that.

12:37.780 --> 12:39.400
In fact, my son went back to pop.

12:39.400 --> 12:43.020
He's still watching popular MMOs, which is a mine craft.

12:43.020 --> 12:47.740
Uh, you know, it's a pair of streamers that will do Minecraft stuff.

12:47.740 --> 12:49.060
And so he's, he's totally watching that.

12:49.060 --> 12:52.660
And then my, my kids like keeps talking, talking about hello neighbor and stuff.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.100
How do you know about these games?

12:55.100 --> 12:56.980
Like in five nights at Freddy's and stuff like that.

12:56.980 --> 13:00.300
I'm like, where are you watching this stuff?

13:00.300 --> 13:05.740
So okay, before I let this go though, let me ask you guys and asking the, uh, chatters.

13:05.740 --> 13:06.740
Okay.

13:06.740 --> 13:13.740
So instead of Mr. Rogers neighborhood, Mr. Robert's neighborhood and it's video games,

13:13.740 --> 13:15.960
you better teach them about love and that they're special.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.340
I would, I would at the end of the day, I don't know, man.

13:18.340 --> 13:20.960
And I would say, you know, don't bully the other kids.

13:20.960 --> 13:21.960
Don't be an asshole.

13:21.960 --> 13:22.960
Like your older boy.

13:22.960 --> 13:27.800
I guess I can't say that there's a fine line between, between coming off as a pedophile

13:27.800 --> 13:28.800
and coming off.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.920
And you are also not a Presbyterian minister, Rob.

13:31.920 --> 13:32.920
Just saying.

13:32.920 --> 13:36.820
Well, I mean I could join like the universal Unitarian or whatever that thing is.

13:36.820 --> 13:37.820
You just pay 30 bucks.

13:37.820 --> 13:38.820
Unicornian.

13:38.820 --> 13:39.820
Unicornian.

13:39.820 --> 13:40.820
Sure.

13:40.820 --> 13:41.820
That works.

13:41.820 --> 13:42.820
I like unicorns.

13:42.820 --> 13:44.600
In this way.

13:44.600 --> 13:47.080
Where's that Twitter meme in this house?

13:47.080 --> 13:49.560
We worship unicorns.

13:49.560 --> 13:50.560
That's it.

13:51.160 --> 13:54.880
Cause then we could get like a tax break.

13:54.880 --> 13:55.880
I'm serious.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.560
Let's, let's form the unicornian church.

13:57.560 --> 13:58.560
All right.

13:58.560 --> 13:59.560
I'm, I'm thinking about it.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.240
I don't have to, I have to look into that.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.240
Yeah.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.200
In Alabama, there's the church of the great green frog.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.200
Sorry.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.200
They're Mississippi.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.200
Uh, flying speed.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.200
The great green hippo toad.

14:09.200 --> 14:12.000
They give you a get out of hell free card at conventions.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
I have one somewhere.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
All right.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Anyway.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Come in handy.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.500
JD said it's the universal life church.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.600
It's the one where you pay a fee and can marry people.

14:19.640 --> 14:25.320
Some, I actually almost was going to do that for a friend's wedding.

14:25.320 --> 14:29.160
But then they ended up, they were like, actually, we're going to have to like scale this whole

14:29.160 --> 14:30.560
thing back into a courthouse wedding.

14:30.560 --> 14:32.240
And I was like, all right, you got to do what you got to do.

14:32.240 --> 14:34.920
But yeah, because I remember starting to go through the motions for that.

14:34.920 --> 14:40.200
So I, yeah, Rob Roberts, a future minister, if you want to Rob Roberts wedding, Mr. Roberts

14:40.200 --> 14:41.200
neighborhood.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.200
Anyway.

14:42.200 --> 14:46.000
Uh, Reggie, Reverend Robert's neighborhood, Reverend Roberts.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.640
Oh my God.

14:47.680 --> 14:52.560
I sound like, Oh God, I sound like the type of Reverend Robert sounds like I ought to

14:52.560 --> 14:53.560
be like a gun owner.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.560
Actually.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.040
I think if you like Google Rob Roberts, like you don't always get me, but I think you get

14:58.040 --> 14:59.260
like a gun guy.

14:59.260 --> 15:03.240
And I'm like, Jesus, of course, of course, the most popular Rob Roberts is probably like

15:03.240 --> 15:04.240
a gun guy.

15:04.240 --> 15:05.240
All right.

15:05.240 --> 15:06.240
Anyway.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.240
Um, moving on.

15:07.240 --> 15:12.640
Um, other partnerships, the quote from Reggie, we see ourselves as making a worldwide consumers

15:12.640 --> 15:14.480
smile through our intellectual property.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.900
Fundamentally, we do that four ways.

15:15.900 --> 15:20.800
We do a mobile, do you, uh, we do it with our licensed relationship with other companies

15:20.800 --> 15:21.860
like Kellogg's.

15:21.860 --> 15:25.060
We have other entertainment, which is where we put universal studios and illumination.

15:25.060 --> 15:27.060
Then we have our dedicated video game business.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.620
This is a key part of our strategy.

15:28.620 --> 15:33.500
This is an area where we are having a range of conversations, just like we did for the

15:33.500 --> 15:35.280
other big two partnerships.

15:35.280 --> 15:37.780
When we have something to announce, we will.

15:37.780 --> 15:43.020
So maybe there will be other very large Nintendo partnerships to come in the future.

15:43.020 --> 15:44.020
Who knows?

15:44.020 --> 15:49.540
Uh, more news that we missed on the week off, uh, job listings at Sony talking about an

15:49.540 --> 15:54.580
unannounced PS4 and PC MMORPG.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.660
So could that be a Sony online entertainment game?

15:56.660 --> 16:03.260
Could that be like EverQuest three or something or DC universe two or, I mean, something new

16:03.260 --> 16:07.380
would always be a great thing too, but certainly gets the head spinning on that.

16:07.380 --> 16:12.980
Also other games, a PS4 arcade robot action game, a PS4 strategy, RPG, and a multi-platform

16:12.980 --> 16:14.780
3d fighting action game.

16:14.780 --> 16:16.380
I like robots and action.

16:16.380 --> 16:17.380
That's true.

16:17.380 --> 16:18.380
Robots and action.

16:18.380 --> 16:19.380
Good things.

16:19.380 --> 16:20.380
Uh, let's see.

16:20.380 --> 16:21.380
Other things.

16:21.380 --> 16:22.380
Robots in disguise.

16:22.380 --> 16:26.740
Um, it's always sunny in Philadelphia, the TV show, which I'm surprised is actually still

16:26.740 --> 16:27.740
on.

16:27.740 --> 16:28.740
That's not an almost.

16:28.740 --> 16:29.740
So I think they're almost done.

16:29.740 --> 16:31.180
I was like, that's not a dig.

16:31.180 --> 16:35.460
That show is really funny, but it's been on a really long, it's the 13th season.

16:35.460 --> 16:40.340
Like they're all going to be as old as Danny DeVito was when it started.

16:40.340 --> 16:41.340
You know what I mean?

16:41.820 --> 16:46.020
Anyway, uh, they're, they're getting a mobile game out of that.

16:46.020 --> 16:47.020
It's always sunny in Philadelphia.

16:47.020 --> 16:48.020
So yes.

16:48.020 --> 16:50.260
And I will play that mobile game.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.260
It's going to be garbage.

16:51.260 --> 16:55.180
It's just going to be like the office space game I have, but I will play that game.

16:55.180 --> 16:58.800
I have actually stopped playing the office space game, but I will totally play the it's

16:58.800 --> 17:00.660
always sunny in Philadelphia game.

17:00.660 --> 17:03.740
Uh, the company mono or mondo, excuse me.

17:03.740 --> 17:08.620
Uh, this might be a winter star Sakura mondo is releasing a vinyl soundtrack for Dracula

17:08.620 --> 17:10.420
X Rondo of blood.

17:10.420 --> 17:11.540
I need this in my life.

17:11.540 --> 17:14.100
That's something, I guess they had some at San Diego comic con.

17:14.100 --> 17:18.460
So why isn't somebody getting me one, but I guess there will be an actual release of

17:18.460 --> 17:19.460
this later.

17:19.460 --> 17:21.900
I will have it and I will frame it because I don't have a record player.

17:21.900 --> 17:23.340
I thought you might enjoy that.

17:23.340 --> 17:27.380
Uh, also Shenmue one and two HD going to have some changes.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.220
The brand of products will be gone.

17:29.220 --> 17:30.700
I'm sure that's no surprise to anyone.

17:30.700 --> 17:35.860
Those, you know, brand partnerships are long gone and the load times will be cut.

17:35.860 --> 17:36.860
Well that's good.

17:36.860 --> 17:39.460
No, my long load times.

17:40.340 --> 17:41.340
God damn it.

17:41.340 --> 17:42.340
I hate the future.

17:42.340 --> 17:45.100
I'm going to miss those.

17:45.100 --> 17:50.660
Remember back in the good old days where you'd have to load star comma eight comma one and

17:50.660 --> 17:54.740
then you have to sit there while it loads for 10 minutes off one side and then flip

17:54.740 --> 17:57.420
the disc over and it's got to load off the other side.

17:57.420 --> 17:58.420
Why can't we have that?

17:58.420 --> 18:01.940
How many, but Rob, how many terabytes was that?

18:01.940 --> 18:04.980
Oh, it was one megabyte or not even.

18:04.980 --> 18:05.980
It was okay.

18:05.980 --> 18:06.980
Loki.

18:06.980 --> 18:07.980
It was a Commodore.

18:07.980 --> 18:08.980
No, hold on.

18:09.500 --> 18:10.500
64.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.500
64 kilobytes.

18:11.500 --> 18:15.660
Apple two E. Same code to run the damn games.

18:15.660 --> 18:18.500
And I was good at kicks.

18:18.500 --> 18:26.100
Uh, anyway, um, so a street fighter 30th anniversary collection international got a new trailer

18:26.100 --> 18:27.100
and a release date.

18:27.100 --> 18:32.900
So the Japanese version will have the localized versions and the different names of the bosses

18:32.900 --> 18:34.460
in Japanese text.

18:34.460 --> 18:37.940
So Capcom giving into the fan demands there, which is a good thing.

18:37.940 --> 18:38.940
I really think.

18:38.940 --> 18:42.860
Uh, and there will be an official guide for mega man 11, which is notable.

18:42.860 --> 18:46.940
It's the first mega man guide since 2006.

18:46.940 --> 18:48.180
So there you go.

18:48.180 --> 18:53.200
That's a little bit about what you missed last week when we had the night off with OLR.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.660
Let's talk a little bit about what we've been up to this week and maybe a little last week

18:56.660 --> 19:00.860
too in our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing.

19:00.860 --> 19:01.860
Dark soccer.

19:01.860 --> 19:02.860
How about you?

19:02.860 --> 19:09.940
Um, Kirby and then watching Mario marathon and then playing a Pokemon go because I feel

19:09.940 --> 19:12.020
bad that I'm not giving gifts to everybody.

19:12.020 --> 19:17.260
So I actually travel outside of my neighborhood to go hit pokey stops in my car driving under

19:17.260 --> 19:18.560
20 miles an hour.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.220
I see that as a good thing and a bad thing.

19:20.220 --> 19:21.220
You know what I mean?

19:21.220 --> 19:24.260
It's a good thing cause it motivates you to get out of the house.

19:24.260 --> 19:25.260
It's the Pokemon.

19:25.260 --> 19:29.820
Pokemon go does not let me live my hikikomori a fantasy, but at the same time I think you

19:29.820 --> 19:33.180
have to like let that obligation go a little bit.

19:33.180 --> 19:37.680
Like Jamie, if I'm gonna tell you right now, if you forget to send me a present one day,

19:37.680 --> 19:38.680
it's okay.

19:38.680 --> 19:41.100
Did you haven't opened my present for three days?

19:41.100 --> 19:42.220
I can't.

19:42.220 --> 19:43.300
I can't.

19:43.300 --> 19:44.300
You did it today.

19:44.300 --> 19:45.300
So I forgive you.

19:45.300 --> 19:46.300
Okay.

19:46.300 --> 19:47.300
Okay.

19:47.300 --> 19:52.500
Um, but I'm just saying, you know, it's, you know, I, I, I remember to take it out a little

19:52.500 --> 19:55.900
bit more often when I'm out and about like, you know, when I was at my delicious Thai

19:55.900 --> 19:57.900
lunch, we were by two pokey stops.

19:57.900 --> 19:59.500
So I did gyms.

19:59.500 --> 20:05.940
I raided by myself when I went to a certain market that someone told me had those chocolates

20:05.940 --> 20:10.620
that I like and I spent way too much money there.

20:10.620 --> 20:11.620
My bad.

20:11.620 --> 20:12.620
Right.

20:12.620 --> 20:18.960
Um, and then, um, I don't know, I've just been kinda sitting back.

20:18.960 --> 20:22.360
I want to, um, actually hook up my steam link cause well, I actually don't think it's going

20:22.360 --> 20:26.460
to work in the room that we've moved our CRT to cause we hooked up the CRT in the office

20:26.460 --> 20:30.140
so that I can start streaming, um, stuff off the SNES.

20:30.140 --> 20:31.140
Nice.

20:31.140 --> 20:37.580
Um, but I'm actually considering because, and I'm not, but I'm actually considering

20:37.580 --> 20:42.220
streaming games that I don't want to play if people will donate to my GoFundMe for my

20:42.220 --> 20:46.860
mom cause she got fired from her job, which we're pretty sure has to do with age and gender

20:46.860 --> 20:53.140
discrimination cause it's Alabama, which is a right to work state, which is just completely

20:53.140 --> 20:54.140
terrible.

20:54.140 --> 20:55.140
There's no protection.

20:55.380 --> 21:01.220
They actually broke some very things that would actually have their HR sued out here.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.380
They just flat out told her some garbage.

21:03.380 --> 21:07.940
So, um, so I've got to keep my mom in her home for three more months until she gets

21:07.940 --> 21:08.940
her widow benefits.

21:08.940 --> 21:14.020
So if you want to see me play shit, I hate halo is halo on the table.

21:14.020 --> 21:17.620
Halo's on the table, but I'd have to play it over here so I'd come over on a Friday

21:17.620 --> 21:18.620
night.

21:18.620 --> 21:19.620
We'll figure it out.

21:19.620 --> 21:20.620
We'll make it work.

21:20.620 --> 21:21.620
Okay.

21:21.620 --> 21:22.620
Shoot.

21:22.700 --> 21:26.500
I might figure out how to get everything up and running.

21:26.500 --> 21:27.500
All right.

21:27.500 --> 21:28.500
Get that going.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.780
I'll put the minute they see you up there streaming stuff, they'll, they'll be more

21:31.780 --> 21:34.380
inclined to make you play bad stuff.

21:34.380 --> 21:35.380
We'll see.

21:35.380 --> 21:36.380
Oh, I don't know.

21:36.380 --> 21:41.980
I'm planning on playing, uh, the, uh, hive swap, um, dating SIM cause I've picked up

21:41.980 --> 21:46.460
all eight episodes of it last night cause I like dating Sims.

21:46.460 --> 21:48.700
I'm trying to think what terrible game I really want Jamie to play.

21:48.700 --> 21:51.220
I got to really like stew on this for a little bit anyway.

21:51.220 --> 21:52.220
All right.

21:52.300 --> 21:54.940
Other games in our gaming week, Loki, how about you?

21:54.940 --> 21:59.900
Um, well this week I went ahead cause they had the whole Amazon prime days thing.

21:59.900 --> 22:03.940
So we decided to get a 4k TV.

22:03.940 --> 22:08.980
So we got a 4k TV and then of course to go along with it, I picked it, I traded in my

22:08.980 --> 22:12.180
PlayStation four for a PlayStation four pro.

22:12.180 --> 22:18.480
And so now I have that hooked up and I picked up, um, I think of horizon zero dawn to play

22:18.480 --> 22:19.480
that.

22:19.480 --> 22:25.720
The problem though is because I have a 4k TV, the kids want to play Disney infinity

22:25.720 --> 22:32.200
on it just for no reason, even though that doesn't benefit from 4k or the pro at all.

22:32.200 --> 22:36.160
And then my wife keeps watching house on it because you know, because you know, house

22:36.160 --> 22:43.120
is just such a current and you know, a current show we haven't watched already, but whatever.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.520
So I have literally gotten the play horizon zero.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.560
I actually haven't gotten the play horizon zero dawn.

22:47.560 --> 22:54.020
I got to watch part of the intro before the kids like, Oh my fucking God, I just want

22:54.020 --> 22:57.400
to see what the 4k looks like already.

22:57.400 --> 23:01.520
So unfortunately I haven't got to touch much in console gaming this week.

23:01.520 --> 23:04.000
Um, it's mostly been Pokemon go.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.360
Um, and even I'm kind of disappointed, so I haven't even got to play my SNES classic

23:08.360 --> 23:10.800
very much, even though I've modded the hell out of that.

23:10.800 --> 23:14.960
Um, because once again, I haven't been able to touch the TV.

23:14.960 --> 23:22.640
Um, what I have been doing in place of playing games on TV is I've been, I don't know what

23:22.640 --> 23:23.840
prompted me to do this.

23:23.840 --> 23:28.560
I think I was looking, Oh, I remember now cause I wanted to do like, start working on

23:28.560 --> 23:31.840
a third person shooter to create a third person shooter.

23:31.840 --> 23:38.600
And I was kind of disappointed with what was available for unity and kind of some of the

23:38.600 --> 23:44.520
template, not really templates, but like some of the like lessons or whatever to kind of

23:44.520 --> 23:46.760
roll your own third person shooter engine type thing.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.680
And it just was not looking great.

23:48.680 --> 23:52.060
So I decided, Hey, you know what, maybe I should just work outside of unity and look

23:52.060 --> 23:53.340
at some other engines.

23:53.340 --> 23:59.660
So I've been teaching myself unreal four, um, this week and actually actually this weekend

23:59.660 --> 24:00.840
last week.

24:00.840 --> 24:05.160
And so I've been going through some stuff in that and I really like how the engine kind

24:05.160 --> 24:08.080
of makes things a little bit easier to make it look nice.

24:08.080 --> 24:13.040
And they have a lot of presets for, you know, doing a first person shooter or third person

24:13.040 --> 24:17.000
shooter game and all that kind of stuff because that's what the engines for.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.240
So it makes sense.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.640
Um, so I haven't really gotten into the programming yet.

24:20.640 --> 24:26.000
I've been actually teaching myself the blueprint stuff in the meantime, which it's a little

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
bit getting used to because I, you know, I like sometimes just being able to type stuff

24:30.000 --> 24:33.640
in there instead of having to do all this arbitrary linking of stuff.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.480
But I still, I like it.

24:35.480 --> 24:36.560
It's still pretty easy.

24:36.560 --> 24:41.280
Um, and I was messing around with it and you know, was able to build things that look nice.

24:41.280 --> 24:46.000
So, um, I do have something I'm working on that will be done probably this week.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.940
So it just like as a, you know, finish something just to learn type thing.

24:50.940 --> 24:53.360
So there's that.

24:53.360 --> 24:56.840
Then once I finished them, I can say, shut the fuck up about me finishing something cause

24:56.840 --> 24:57.840
it's done.

24:57.840 --> 24:58.840
See, there you go.

24:58.840 --> 24:59.840
Aaron, fuck off.

24:59.840 --> 25:00.840
Yeah.

25:00.840 --> 25:03.360
But I'm hoping to learn a little bit more with that cause I think actually this might

25:03.360 --> 25:08.240
be a better option than unity for me cause it seems that I don't know, I'll have to figure

25:08.240 --> 25:10.400
out what the strengths and weaknesses are.

25:10.400 --> 25:14.480
And today of course, you know, I'm a terrible, terrible, terrible game developer and the

25:14.480 --> 25:19.840
fact that I never use version control, uh, or source control or whatever.

25:19.840 --> 25:25.120
So I had to teach myself how to use, um, those behaviors bite you in the ass.

25:25.120 --> 25:26.120
Yeah.

25:26.120 --> 25:31.000
So I had to, I had to teach myself how to use source tree and get bucket today, um,

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
bit buckets.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.240
So finally got that to work.

25:34.240 --> 25:39.680
Um, because even the lessons that I'm following, um, what they said to do didn't work.

25:39.680 --> 25:43.040
So I had to figure it out myself through the terminal and I finally got that to work.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.600
But yes, I have source control now.

25:44.600 --> 25:45.800
So that, that's great.

25:45.800 --> 25:48.160
I'm, I'm doing all the right things.

25:48.160 --> 25:52.720
Uh, our pal Bobby Black Wolf says, I honestly think the blueprint stuff in UE4 will be better

25:52.720 --> 25:53.720
for Loki.

25:53.720 --> 25:54.720
It is.

25:54.720 --> 25:58.360
And I, but I do want to learn the C plus plus stuff as well.

25:58.360 --> 26:03.960
But um, honestly, I don't think that there's really any downside to using the blueprint

26:03.960 --> 26:10.120
stuff because I optimization wise, it's about the same where it's like in unity, it can

26:10.120 --> 26:11.120
get fun.

26:11.120 --> 26:15.080
And it's just like even getting stuff to look nice and unity is such a pain in the ass.

26:15.080 --> 26:19.500
Whereas unreal is just fucking gorgeous out the, I mean you can make crap and it looks,

26:19.500 --> 26:21.200
it's so amazing looking crap.

26:21.200 --> 26:24.480
I mean, I just, I like how easy that is.

26:24.480 --> 26:27.340
So I'm curious to see how this will go.

26:27.340 --> 26:32.200
So I'm optimistic, but I've been, I've been, see, I've been working on stuff.

26:32.600 --> 26:33.600
All right.

26:33.600 --> 26:34.600
Haven't haven't let go of it.

26:34.600 --> 26:39.800
I do want to play some 4k gaming and I want to try the PlayStation VR now that I've got

26:39.800 --> 26:45.160
something that'll, you know, output better, but I don't know, we'll just have to wait

26:45.160 --> 26:46.160
and see.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.160
All right.

26:47.160 --> 26:51.240
Uh, my gaming week, uh, let's see, I've been playing Pokemon go as well.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.240
Why not?

26:52.240 --> 26:53.240
I'll just add onto that.

26:53.240 --> 26:55.840
I participated in the Zapdos day yesterday for a little bit.

26:55.840 --> 26:59.400
I had a rehearsal for a, which I guess I should give a cheap plug.

26:59.400 --> 27:03.280
Clue is finally happening this Saturday, uh, here in Sacramento at the colonial theater.

27:03.280 --> 27:05.280
So that's the big thing I've been preparing for.

27:05.280 --> 27:09.080
So we had a rehearsal, so I couldn't do the Zapdos the entire time, but I was able to

27:09.080 --> 27:11.000
do the first two hours.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.040
And in that time we rated like 10 different things and I did get a shiny Zapdos.

27:15.040 --> 27:19.480
So it was like one of the lowest possible appraisals, but eh, I'll take it.

27:19.480 --> 27:20.480
It was fun.

27:20.480 --> 27:23.520
So, um, yeah, just trying to keep getting XP.

27:23.520 --> 27:25.540
Speaking of getting XP, I should mention this too.

27:25.540 --> 27:30.740
So not Pokemon go, but Niantic's other game, Ingress, um, I hit level 16 on, congratulations.

27:30.740 --> 27:33.420
That is a big pain in the ass.

27:33.420 --> 27:36.260
I hit the maximum possible level you can hit in that game.

27:36.260 --> 27:40.260
So it's, it's similar to being 40 and Pokemon go, but obviously they're different games.

27:40.260 --> 27:45.580
So, uh, I actually, I, I, so they kind of had an event going on.

27:45.580 --> 27:49.820
It just finished like two hours ago, but Niantic was like buffing the experience for portal

27:49.820 --> 27:51.440
deploys.

27:51.440 --> 27:55.480
And so I was really able to use that to my advantage, um, by going down and like to the

27:55.480 --> 27:56.880
capital and stuff and deploying.

27:56.880 --> 28:03.000
So I actually, uh, timed it so that my last, uh, the thing that got me level 16 is I deployed

28:03.000 --> 28:09.160
on the state capital, a reso one and a reso six, and that gave me a level 16 and yeah,

28:09.160 --> 28:10.160
super nerdy.

28:10.160 --> 28:11.160
Right.

28:11.160 --> 28:12.160
So, uh, but that was cool.

28:12.160 --> 28:13.160
So a big accomplishment.

28:13.160 --> 28:18.520
So, um, I wanted to be one of the first players that got to 1640.

28:18.520 --> 28:21.480
So level 16 in ingress and level 40 in Pokemon go.

28:21.480 --> 28:25.480
But one of my buddies here locally, uh, from both those games actually just, he just hit

28:25.480 --> 28:27.480
40 and Pokemon go this past week.

28:27.480 --> 28:29.280
And so it made him the first player in Sacramento.

28:29.280 --> 28:30.280
Who's a 1640.

28:30.280 --> 28:32.760
So that's, so I hope to follow in his footsteps.

28:32.760 --> 28:36.960
Uh, that's, I'll probably be, I'm still waiting to level up from whatever level I'm at.

28:36.960 --> 28:39.040
Cause I'm already like 2 million over the cap.

28:39.040 --> 28:40.040
Oh yeah.

28:40.040 --> 28:41.040
It's like a badge.

28:41.040 --> 28:42.040
You're locked in with bad.

28:42.040 --> 28:43.040
Yeah.

28:43.040 --> 28:44.040
I'm locked in with badges.

28:44.040 --> 28:45.040
So, and yeah, I just don't care.

28:45.040 --> 28:48.280
It eventually will come, which is, yeah.

28:48.280 --> 28:49.280
When it's ready.

28:49.280 --> 28:52.480
Um, so anyway, so yeah, that was my AR gaming.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.960
And then when the Harry Potter game comes out, I'm going to try to get max level in

28:54.960 --> 28:55.960
that.

28:55.960 --> 28:58.880
Assuming the game is as good as, you know, ingress and Pokemon go here about the new

28:58.880 --> 28:59.880
update.

28:59.880 --> 29:00.880
They have like new updates coming.

29:00.880 --> 29:03.660
Well, obviously you always have new updates coming for Pokemon go, but they've got some

29:03.660 --> 29:05.280
new like lucky Pokemon now.

29:05.280 --> 29:06.280
Yeah.

29:06.280 --> 29:08.680
I heard about this thing that, um, I guess the latest version of date, cause they're

29:08.680 --> 29:11.880
implementing the Celebi quest are probably going to go live next week or the rest of

29:11.880 --> 29:12.880
us.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.780
Uh, Shane got his when he went to go fest.

29:14.820 --> 29:18.460
So, but the rest of us get to get a Celebi soon, um, which, Oh, the speaking of Shane

29:18.460 --> 29:21.060
going to go fest, he brought me back a Torco tour.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.060
Is that a Torco?

29:22.060 --> 29:23.060
Yeah.

29:23.060 --> 29:24.060
The little turtle, the turtle.

29:24.060 --> 29:25.060
Yeah.

29:25.060 --> 29:26.060
So, uh, that's cool.

29:26.060 --> 29:29.420
Cause I got that in my pokey decks and then, uh, JD was in Florida recently and it's supposed

29:29.420 --> 29:31.500
to be bringing me a hair across and a course solo.

29:31.500 --> 29:32.500
So I'm really excited.

29:32.500 --> 29:33.500
Yay.

29:33.500 --> 29:34.500
So that'll really help with my decks.

29:34.500 --> 29:35.500
Now.

29:35.500 --> 29:36.500
I just need mr.

29:36.500 --> 29:37.500
Mime and King King is gone.

29:37.500 --> 29:39.500
Um, so I guess I'll have to go to Australia.

29:39.500 --> 29:40.500
I don't know.

29:40.500 --> 29:41.500
Anyway.

29:41.500 --> 29:43.540
Um, well they'll probably like do some event where they'll swap it over here.

29:43.540 --> 29:47.060
And they had Kangaskhan in Anaheim at one point when they did Pokemon worlds.

29:47.060 --> 29:48.060
Remember that?

29:48.060 --> 29:52.140
And some of the crazies here drove all the way to Anaheim to get a fucking Kangaskhan,

29:52.140 --> 29:54.260
which is like what an eight hour drive down there.

29:54.260 --> 29:57.020
But you know, what does it is then go to Disneyland.

29:57.020 --> 29:58.020
Yeah, I know.

29:58.020 --> 29:59.020
Right.

29:59.020 --> 30:00.020
Yeah.

30:00.020 --> 30:02.060
It's like, you can't, you can't exactly say you're crazy going all the way to Anaheim

30:02.060 --> 30:03.060
just to get a Kangaskhan.

30:03.060 --> 30:06.340
If you're going to like swing by Disneyland, why there we'll just think about the mad mad

30:06.340 --> 30:09.100
pokey stops that are going to be in Nintendo land whenever that opens.

30:09.100 --> 30:10.100
Oh, right.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.100
I'm sure.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.820
Well, they're going to have to get submitted and go through that whole process, but I'm

30:12.820 --> 30:14.220
sure it'll, I'm sure it'll fill out really.

30:14.220 --> 30:15.220
I don't know.

30:15.220 --> 30:19.900
Will Nintendo be able to submit players will do it in a heartbeat.

30:19.900 --> 30:20.900
Yeah, absolutely.

30:20.900 --> 30:21.900
Anyway.

30:21.900 --> 30:25.260
Um, so non mobile AR gave me stuff I play cause there's been other stuff.

30:25.260 --> 30:28.380
So, um, this just released this past week and it was kind of like one of those, I didn't

30:28.380 --> 30:33.220
realize this was coming and uh, I had to get it when I saw that tempest 4,000 came out

30:33.220 --> 30:34.220
this week.

30:34.220 --> 30:38.180
Uh, it's a kind of the spiritual successor in many ways to tempest 2000.

30:38.180 --> 30:41.860
No, it's this, it's the direct successor to tempest 3000.

30:41.900 --> 30:42.900
Right.

30:42.900 --> 30:47.540
Well, but wasn't 3000 kind of like 3000 was really just, you can't call it a spiritual

30:47.540 --> 30:50.460
successor when it's actually in the same series.

30:50.460 --> 30:53.980
Spiritual successor would mean it's a different series, but a similar game.

30:53.980 --> 30:54.980
All right.

30:54.980 --> 30:58.980
I guess even though, but it's, it's not on the same platform, but whatever I get what

30:58.980 --> 30:59.980
you're saying.

30:59.980 --> 31:01.780
So, um, so it's tempest 4,000.

31:01.780 --> 31:06.480
Well here's, here's the thing, Jamie, here's why I think I'm leaning towards saying spiritual

31:06.480 --> 31:07.480
successor.

31:07.480 --> 31:12.360
Um, tempest 4,000 may be the first game that I refund on steam.

31:12.360 --> 31:18.000
So it, it, it kinda like honestly in, in the position it's in right now, it doesn't deserve

31:18.000 --> 31:20.240
to be in the same line as tempest 2000.

31:20.240 --> 31:21.880
That's where my brain went.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.920
But this is, this is supposed to be one of those games that's going to sell me on the

31:24.920 --> 31:28.520
Atari ST or the new platform that they have, right?

31:28.520 --> 31:29.720
Here's the thing.

31:29.720 --> 31:34.840
It's not that my experiences with the game, I mean the game itself is okay.

31:34.840 --> 31:38.640
I mean it doesn't really seem to do anything that much different than tempest 2000.

31:38.640 --> 31:40.000
Here's the problem.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.960
On PC, I don't know, and some of you have probably heard about this already.

31:44.960 --> 31:50.640
The PC version is $10 cheaper than the console versions, which is cool.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.320
I mean I'm not going to complain about that.

31:52.320 --> 31:55.560
I mean I guess I would if I was more of a console person.

31:55.560 --> 31:59.960
But the problem with the PC version is that they didn't do like anything.

31:59.960 --> 32:05.440
It's like somebody just hit the switch to dump their comp, you know, dump the program

32:05.440 --> 32:08.800
instead of compiling it for Xbox one, compiling for the PC.

32:08.800 --> 32:12.560
And what I mean by that is you can't change any of the video options.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.840
You can't change any of the keyboard mappings.

32:14.840 --> 32:19.040
So either you're going to play with really fucking crazy keyboard mappings or you're

32:19.040 --> 32:20.040
stuck.

32:20.040 --> 32:21.780
You have to use an Xbox 360 controller.

32:21.780 --> 32:29.940
You can't use the mouse, which is redonkulous for a game like tempest, which is not the

32:29.940 --> 32:32.000
same thing on a controller.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.220
And it just kind of like, it controls funky with the Xbox 360 controller.

32:36.220 --> 32:37.960
I just don't like it.

32:37.960 --> 32:42.920
So like, I just, I don't know, like honestly I played around in tempest 4000 like finally

32:42.920 --> 32:46.360
when I figured out how to like to reboot my whole computer to get it to see the control

32:46.360 --> 32:47.360
and all this stuff.

32:47.360 --> 32:49.080
And I was just like, mama, this is garbage.

32:49.080 --> 32:54.480
Like it's just, it's not what tempest 2000 was to me when it was on the Jaguar.

32:54.480 --> 33:00.000
So I'm sorry to be so unkind, but at the same time, this is a half ass fucking port.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.840
If I have ever seen one and this franchise deserves better.

33:03.840 --> 33:08.280
Hello and welcome to modern day Atari where all of their ports are half ass pieces of

33:08.280 --> 33:09.280
shit.

33:09.280 --> 33:15.120
Enjoy processing my refund because it sucks because they redid, they redid alone in the

33:15.120 --> 33:17.440
dark and it was shit.

33:17.440 --> 33:20.960
They redid well tempest and I apparently that shit.

33:20.960 --> 33:26.440
And then they, um, I think they ported their, well they're porting their mobile version

33:26.440 --> 33:32.440
of um, theme park and that's going to be shit as well.

33:32.440 --> 33:42.040
So I'm sorry, but my, my review on tempest 4000 is a pass until they fix the PC version.

33:42.040 --> 33:45.040
What the fuck were they thinking putting that out?

33:45.040 --> 33:46.040
That was awful.

33:46.040 --> 33:47.680
That was a horrible decision.

33:47.680 --> 33:53.960
So anyway, that's why I was trying to distance it from tempest 2000, which is an amazing

33:53.960 --> 33:58.600
a game that, you know, from years and years ago, but unfortunately just like, you know,

33:58.600 --> 34:02.520
you can't, anyway, I could go on and on.

34:02.520 --> 34:07.480
Let's talk about something more positive, shall we, uh, a game that I, uh, did not think

34:07.480 --> 34:12.640
I would enjoy, although it seems like everybody else I know was really enjoying it.

34:12.640 --> 34:16.480
And finally it was one of those things where between all the Twitch streams, all the tweets

34:16.480 --> 34:19.760
that kind of like positive buzz and energy was, I had to feed off of it.

34:19.760 --> 34:24.640
And I finally, I plunked down the money and bought Octopath traveler, um, on the switch.

34:24.640 --> 34:26.920
And I gotta say, I like it.

34:26.920 --> 34:28.520
I really, really like it.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.960
And it seems that the game is doing very well.

34:30.960 --> 34:35.560
Um, I don't know if we have any hard sales numbers yet, but it really, I mean, and this

34:35.560 --> 34:39.520
could be just like confirmation bias or whatever, but like I look at my friends list on the

34:39.520 --> 34:42.080
switch and it's like, everybody is fucking playing this game.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.440
Like, yeah, I haven't bought it yet.

34:44.440 --> 34:48.960
This game has to be selling better than Square Enix could have projected, which I think is

34:48.960 --> 34:56.420
a great thing because it shows that it's not that everything has to be Sprite retro type

34:56.420 --> 35:01.720
of stuff, which I do like the kind of like hybridness of the fact that you are these

35:01.720 --> 35:05.760
like old school sprites, but like, you know, it's a lot of like new school looking environments

35:05.760 --> 35:09.320
where the water effects are beautiful and a lot of like the, you know, blurring that

35:09.320 --> 35:10.720
they do and some of that stuff.

35:10.720 --> 35:12.240
It looks really good when it's in motion.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.880
I don't think screenshots do it justice.

35:13.880 --> 35:15.600
It looks really good in motion.

35:15.600 --> 35:20.820
Um, but anyway, my point is, is that, and the fact that the battle system is a very

35:20.820 --> 35:25.160
kind of old school, you know, super Nintendo ask RPG battle system.

35:25.160 --> 35:26.840
I mean, they do have some new stuff in it.

35:26.840 --> 35:29.960
Like, you know, you have the breaking system, which is unique.

35:29.960 --> 35:33.080
I don't remember seeing something like that in another game, but like, you know, at some

35:33.080 --> 35:40.000
point, like one of the JRPG classics, final fantasy kind of really fell off the path with

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
the battle system.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Right.

35:42.000 --> 35:46.760
Because, you know, 10 was very kind of standard, but then 12 really changed it.

35:46.760 --> 35:52.160
Um, which was, I still, I like 12, I'm not knocking 12, I love 12, but it was very different.

35:52.160 --> 35:59.160
13 was really different and I still, I like 13s battle system, but it's not like a classic

35:59.160 --> 36:00.160
JRPG at all.

36:00.240 --> 36:06.400
And obviously I'm skipping 11 and 14 for obvious reasons, but then 15 was also another like

36:06.400 --> 36:08.760
radical change to the battle system.

36:08.760 --> 36:14.320
I don't feel as good on what they did with 15 as they did with 12 and 13, but okay.

36:14.320 --> 36:17.080
So like, I don't know, like there's, there's part of me that says it's kind of good that

36:17.080 --> 36:24.360
like an old school mechanic JRPG is being received this well, because I think it shows

36:24.360 --> 36:26.100
that there's still a demand for that.

36:26.100 --> 36:28.400
And I think it is going to send Square Enix a message.

36:28.640 --> 36:31.720
Um, at least for the people in this country, you know, I don't know how the game is doing

36:31.720 --> 36:35.440
in Japan, which is obviously very important as well, uh, to the direction that's going

36:35.440 --> 36:36.440
to be taken.

36:36.440 --> 36:42.680
But I think it is a sure, sure thing we will see an Octopath Traveler 2 or some type of,

36:42.680 --> 36:45.800
you know, I don't know, where do you go from Octopath Traveler?

36:45.800 --> 36:48.800
Like nine, what is the prefix for nine?

36:48.800 --> 36:49.800
New chrono trigger?

36:49.800 --> 36:50.800
Yeah.

36:50.800 --> 36:51.800
I don't know.

36:51.800 --> 36:52.800
Um, crap.

36:52.800 --> 36:53.800
I actually know this.

36:54.200 --> 36:58.480
Maybe they'll go, maybe they'll regress and do seven, heptapath, well hepta or septa.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.480
Yeah.

36:59.480 --> 37:00.480
Septopath.

37:00.480 --> 37:01.480
Yeah.

37:01.480 --> 37:02.480
What is nine?

37:02.480 --> 37:03.480
I don't know.

37:03.480 --> 37:04.480
Anyway.

37:04.480 --> 37:13.520
Um, a tiger claw in chat says, uh, J D says nono, like a nonogram.

37:13.520 --> 37:16.040
If you're using the same, um, Greek prefix.

37:16.040 --> 37:17.040
Interesting.

37:17.040 --> 37:18.040
Okay.

37:18.040 --> 37:22.960
So it'd be, you would go to hepta, octo, enia, deca, if you're all using Greek.

37:23.120 --> 37:24.520
So that would be seven, six.

37:24.520 --> 37:26.960
Maybe they'll just get, cause I bet people wouldn't recognize the nines, they just go

37:26.960 --> 37:33.880
to decapath traveler or they'll just do Octopath Traveler 2 and the local octopuses and Octomom

37:33.880 --> 37:34.880
is in it.

37:34.880 --> 37:35.880
Ultros is in it.

37:35.880 --> 37:39.000
Ultros and, and Octodad is in it.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Yes.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.320
And um, what other famous octopi are there?

37:42.320 --> 37:46.480
Um, that one that still that threw the fish at the guy because it didn't like his dinner.

37:46.480 --> 37:47.480
Octodad.

37:47.480 --> 37:48.480
I said Octodad.

37:48.480 --> 37:49.480
Yeah.

37:49.480 --> 37:50.480
Yeah.

37:50.480 --> 37:51.480
Octodad.

37:51.480 --> 37:52.480
Anyway.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Here's my one criticism.

37:54.000 --> 38:00.200
My one minor criticism of Octopi, cause obviously I, in all fairness, uh, I've sunk maybe like

38:00.200 --> 38:04.880
five hours in the game and I have three characters, you know, like, and you have to go around

38:04.880 --> 38:05.880
and collect all eight.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.800
It's like, I've got a long way to go.

38:07.800 --> 38:14.400
Um, I do feel like the three stories I've played so far, I started with Ophelia, who's

38:14.400 --> 38:16.560
like your cleric, your healer.

38:16.560 --> 38:21.300
Um, and then I picked up, I just kind of went in a circle cause I went to the nearest people.

38:21.320 --> 38:25.180
So I've got Cyrus who's like the scholar, your black mage basically.

38:25.180 --> 38:32.260
Uh, and then I just picked up Tressa who is a merchant, but she uses like spears and bows.

38:32.260 --> 38:35.660
So she's kind of, I don't know, dragoon-y, I don't know what to call her.

38:35.660 --> 38:39.060
Well, maybe more like a ocean merchant.

38:39.060 --> 38:40.060
Yeah, actually.

38:40.060 --> 38:41.060
Like a pirate.

38:41.060 --> 38:44.580
She, again, she uses wind magic, so you're not too off base.

38:44.580 --> 38:45.580
That probably, you're probably.

38:45.580 --> 38:46.580
I think she's a pirate.

38:46.580 --> 38:47.580
She's probably more a pirate.

38:47.580 --> 38:48.900
In my heart, I think she's a pirate.

38:48.900 --> 38:49.900
Yeah.

38:49.900 --> 38:50.900
So anyway.

38:50.900 --> 38:51.900
She uses highway robbery.

38:51.900 --> 38:57.340
But anyway, the thing about all those stories, I liked them.

38:57.340 --> 39:01.540
I thought Ophelia's was a little cliche-y RPG.

39:01.540 --> 39:04.880
I was kind of like rolling my eyes, but I really liked the other two.

39:04.880 --> 39:07.140
I really, really liked Tressa's.

39:07.140 --> 39:14.340
Um, but anyway, uh, I did feel like all of their openings were the same template.

39:14.340 --> 39:18.900
What I mean by that is that, you know, you get opening sequence.

39:18.900 --> 39:22.140
You get, here is the path action that you're going to learn.

39:22.140 --> 39:23.340
Now use it.

39:23.340 --> 39:27.620
And then here is, you're going to go down one screen into another screen.

39:27.620 --> 39:30.420
And then you're going to go down one more screen into the town.

39:30.420 --> 39:33.020
And then right next to the town is the dungeon.

39:33.020 --> 39:35.220
And at the end of the dungeon, you will fight the boss.

39:35.220 --> 39:37.060
And then once you fight the boss, good job.

39:37.060 --> 39:38.460
You can move on to the next one.

39:38.460 --> 39:43.020
So I kind of felt like there's a very like template to it all.

39:43.020 --> 39:46.580
But I also like, again, it's a minor, it's a minor criticism.

39:46.580 --> 39:50.180
I just felt it was a little bit like, okay, I'd like to be maybe like surprised.

39:50.180 --> 39:54.220
I can imagine that if you're doing a game where the whole kitsch is, you get to start

39:54.220 --> 39:59.200
with any of the eight and do them in any order, then there has to be some sort of balance

39:59.200 --> 40:00.200
between them all.

40:00.200 --> 40:01.740
So I'm giving the game a pass.

40:01.740 --> 40:08.140
I imagine the more fun and the less like copy pasty type of things will be when you have

40:08.140 --> 40:12.000
your entire party and you start to move into the chapter two stuff so the game can start

40:12.000 --> 40:14.500
to do different things because they'll know you have all eight characters.

40:14.540 --> 40:16.660
It sounds very much like Seiken Densetsu though.

40:16.660 --> 40:18.140
Seiken Densetsu 3.

40:18.140 --> 40:19.140
Yes.

40:19.140 --> 40:22.300
Where you start off with the different characters and the different paths.

40:22.300 --> 40:24.060
Or Saga, which a lot of people are compared to.

40:24.060 --> 40:25.780
But I didn't, I didn't like Saga.

40:25.780 --> 40:26.940
I didn't like the battle system.

40:26.940 --> 40:27.940
I didn't like...

40:27.940 --> 40:28.940
I'm not a big Saga fan.

40:28.940 --> 40:29.940
Yeah.

40:29.940 --> 40:34.340
And honestly, it's what, when people compared Octopath to Saga, I was instantly like, had

40:34.340 --> 40:35.340
that, I don't know.

40:35.340 --> 40:39.340
You know what my thought is that I would like Octopath for the same reason I like Duprism

40:39.340 --> 40:41.900
or what do we have, Threads of Fate over here.

40:42.580 --> 40:44.860
Well, because you start, you have two paths.

40:44.860 --> 40:48.620
You start off with each character and then eventually they, their stories merge.

40:48.620 --> 40:49.620
So.

40:49.620 --> 40:50.620
Um, let's see.

40:50.620 --> 40:55.460
Uh, Ragenator in chat asks, Cyrus, like Billy Ray or Miley?

40:55.460 --> 40:56.460
Clearly Miley.

40:56.460 --> 40:57.460
Clearly.

40:57.460 --> 40:59.060
I mean, Dolly Parton is her godmother.

40:59.060 --> 41:00.060
Hello.

41:00.060 --> 41:01.060
I know.

41:01.060 --> 41:02.060
She came in like a wrecking ball.

41:02.060 --> 41:03.340
Although Cyrus in this story is male.

41:03.340 --> 41:04.340
But whatever.

41:04.340 --> 41:05.340
All right.

41:05.340 --> 41:06.340
Anyway.

41:06.340 --> 41:09.500
Uh, Dartetsuya says, I was just thinking it sounds like Seiken Densetsu 3.

41:09.500 --> 41:10.500
Yeah.

41:10.500 --> 41:12.260
The layout kind of, kind of.

41:12.260 --> 41:13.260
Anyway.

41:13.260 --> 41:15.780
Um, so yeah, that's, that game's been taking up a lot of my time as well.

41:15.780 --> 41:19.820
So otherwise I'm still playing Heroes of the Storm, Final Fantasy 14.

41:19.820 --> 41:26.100
Um, if for those that play Final Fantasy 14, my, my Eureka, I just got my plus one weapon

41:26.100 --> 41:30.900
in Eureka and I'm up to level 18 in the Eureka thing for all you three people that also are

41:30.900 --> 41:32.300
playing Final Fantasy 14 out there.

41:32.300 --> 41:34.060
But I'm having fun with that.

41:34.060 --> 41:35.120
So there you go.

41:35.120 --> 41:36.900
That's my kind of busy gaming week.

41:36.900 --> 41:40.400
Sadly, I have to admit, I still have not been able to go through the motions of setting

41:40.400 --> 41:41.560
up the VR and all that stuff.

41:41.560 --> 41:43.680
I wanted to do it last week, but then I got sick.

41:43.680 --> 41:45.780
Well, here's where I'm running into a problem.

41:45.780 --> 41:49.280
This space in there where I have the PS4, it's kind of hard to like set up the camera.

41:49.280 --> 41:53.980
I kind of don't have enough space, so I kind of have to do it out here, which means I got

41:53.980 --> 41:56.920
to move everything out here and then I can't really stream it unless I do the native streaming

41:56.920 --> 41:58.520
through the PS4.

41:58.520 --> 42:05.240
But I mean, obviously as soon as we have a date for Tetris Effect, this will all be fast

42:05.240 --> 42:06.240
tracked.

42:06.240 --> 42:07.240
I think it's October.

42:07.240 --> 42:08.240
Yeah.

42:08.240 --> 42:09.240
It's, it's, it'll be here before we know it.

42:09.240 --> 42:10.240
Almost August.

42:10.240 --> 42:11.240
Right.

42:11.240 --> 42:15.620
And then August means, Oh my God, Dragon cons in four weeks, which means by I'll be gone

42:15.620 --> 42:16.620
for a week.

42:16.620 --> 42:18.260
And then after that, I'll be like, Oh my God, it's September.

42:18.260 --> 42:21.300
And it's like, you know, time moves so fast.

42:21.300 --> 42:22.300
My God.

42:22.300 --> 42:25.300
Anyway, it's like, Hey, here's fourth quarter games.

42:25.300 --> 42:26.300
Yeah.

42:26.300 --> 42:27.300
Right.

42:27.300 --> 42:29.780
And then a new Smash Brothers and Nintendo online and everything's here.

42:29.780 --> 42:33.460
So isn't that, that's until December, isn't it?

42:33.460 --> 42:35.660
Uh, yeah, they gave the date for that.

42:35.660 --> 42:36.660
It's it's December.

42:36.660 --> 42:37.660
Yes.

42:37.660 --> 42:40.480
I mean, it's past the November rush, but I remember is a Pokemon.

42:40.480 --> 42:41.480
Yeah.

42:41.480 --> 42:47.680
Well, I also, I kind of feel like thanks to the age of digital distribution in part, uh,

42:47.680 --> 42:51.720
the day at having your game out by black Friday, isn't what it used to be.

42:51.720 --> 42:52.720
No.

42:52.720 --> 42:53.720
You know what I mean?

42:53.720 --> 42:56.220
I've been buying digitally anyways for everything.

42:56.220 --> 43:00.680
So the holiday time period, isn't what it used to be, you know, and the same thing has

43:00.680 --> 43:02.300
been happening to movies.

43:02.300 --> 43:07.960
You know, the two big times to release movies are the summer and the holidays.

43:07.960 --> 43:08.960
Right.

43:08.960 --> 43:09.960
Which is still mostly true.

43:09.960 --> 43:13.440
Like a lot of movies make a lot of big money in those timeframes, but like, I think in

43:13.440 --> 43:17.380
the past, you know, five or so years, you've really seen where like, you know what movies

43:17.380 --> 43:22.560
can come out in February, March, you know, they can come out in October and still make

43:22.560 --> 43:23.560
a ton of money.

43:23.560 --> 43:24.560
You know what I mean?

43:24.560 --> 43:25.560
Mm hmm.

43:25.560 --> 43:27.680
Um, like Deadpool was like a February movie, right?

43:27.680 --> 43:28.680
No, it was March.

43:28.680 --> 43:29.680
Well, the original Deadpool.

43:29.680 --> 43:30.680
Yeah.

43:30.680 --> 43:31.680
Original Deadpool was on Valentine's day.

43:31.680 --> 43:32.680
Right.

43:32.680 --> 43:33.680
And then the new one was in March.

43:33.680 --> 43:35.420
So they were, and they both made shit, tons of money.

43:35.420 --> 43:36.420
So, you know, because they were great.

43:36.420 --> 43:37.420
Yeah, exactly.

43:37.420 --> 43:42.620
It's like, you know, people will go to the cinema to see a movie, you know, last movie

43:42.620 --> 43:43.980
I saw was Deadpool two.

43:43.980 --> 43:44.980
Yeah.

43:44.980 --> 43:49.820
Which God, the last movie I saw was probably whatever art movie you and I saw earlier this

43:49.820 --> 43:50.820
year.

43:50.820 --> 43:56.140
Either like, no, we didn't see, I thought you were going to go see a, the second mama

43:56.140 --> 43:57.140
mia movie.

43:57.140 --> 43:59.980
I had, nobody would see it with me on Friday night.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.640
I haven't seen the first one, but I'll go see it with you as long as I'm at home by

44:03.640 --> 44:04.640
10.

44:04.640 --> 44:05.640
Oh, I've seen it next Saturday.

44:05.640 --> 44:06.640
We'll figure it out.

44:06.640 --> 44:10.960
Well then the other thing is, and I was going to say is that my friend in the Bay area,

44:10.960 --> 44:14.200
Melody who had the baby recently, I still haven't been able to visit the baby cause

44:14.200 --> 44:18.560
Melody's had all her, yeah, well, Melody's had, she, she, I don't want to get in all

44:18.560 --> 44:22.520
her business on the, she's been sick so, but she's fine now.

44:22.520 --> 44:25.040
So I'm going to go visit her and see the baby.

44:25.040 --> 44:28.200
And then she said, fuck yeah, we're going to go see the mama mia thing.

44:28.220 --> 44:30.940
So I knew I'd get to go see it in like two weeks, but I've got to get past this clue

44:30.940 --> 44:34.900
thing first, which admittedly is my own fault for being involved with that.

44:34.900 --> 44:35.900
So anyway.

44:35.900 --> 44:36.900
Okay.

44:36.900 --> 44:37.900
But it's fun.

44:37.900 --> 44:38.900
It's fun.

44:38.900 --> 44:39.900
It's so fun.

44:39.900 --> 44:40.900
The picture came out.

44:40.900 --> 44:43.300
I don't know if you saw the picture of me as Mrs. Peacock, but it's out there now.

44:43.300 --> 44:44.780
So I'm very proud.

44:44.780 --> 44:45.780
Thank you.

44:45.780 --> 44:46.780
Thank you.

44:46.780 --> 44:48.140
I am having a lot of fun with it.

44:48.140 --> 44:49.140
It's good.

44:49.140 --> 44:52.100
So anyway, that's some good drag.

44:52.100 --> 44:57.420
So I, I man, I feel like a woman, but I'll tell you this, you know, you have to do the

44:57.420 --> 44:58.920
Ms. Cracker thing.

44:58.920 --> 45:00.720
She's a woman.

45:00.720 --> 45:01.720
I did.

45:01.720 --> 45:05.080
When I saw, when I saw myself in the mirror the first time after all the makeup was done,

45:05.080 --> 45:10.000
I did do the whole mother, I am gorgeous from drag race.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.240
So it was fun.

45:12.240 --> 45:19.080
But I will say being a woman is hard fucking work because the core set fucking hurts.

45:19.080 --> 45:24.240
Like all my insides are basically being shoved into every other part of my body.

45:24.240 --> 45:25.240
Right.

45:25.240 --> 45:26.240
Okay.

45:26.240 --> 45:30.420
But I was never one to like disrespect femininity women go through.

45:30.420 --> 45:35.500
I'm letting y'all know, yo, I'm still giving you a shit eating grin.

45:35.500 --> 45:36.660
Listen here, man.

45:36.660 --> 45:40.860
Real men try on a core set sometime and try what those ladies go.

45:40.860 --> 45:42.860
And I would, I don't just mean like put on the core set.

45:42.860 --> 45:50.300
I mean, let her lace it and Oh my God, you will have a new found respect for what women

45:50.300 --> 45:51.300
go through.

45:51.300 --> 45:54.040
Because I got to get them hip somehow.

45:54.040 --> 45:58.760
And the course that does that, I'm not going to pad because the dress doesn't like Mrs.

45:58.760 --> 46:03.800
Peacock's dress is too fifties conservative to really show the padding and which means

46:03.800 --> 46:05.880
I don't have to tuck the boys away either.

46:05.880 --> 46:08.560
So I don't have to go like, I hope you have a good crinoline though.

46:08.560 --> 46:09.560
I we're good.

46:09.560 --> 46:10.560
We're good.

46:10.560 --> 46:11.560
Okay.

46:11.560 --> 46:12.560
Um, but then what was I gonna say?

46:12.560 --> 46:13.560
Um, dang it.

46:13.560 --> 46:15.400
Oh, the shoes.

46:15.400 --> 46:16.860
Jesus Christ.

46:16.860 --> 46:18.360
And I've done heels before.

46:18.360 --> 46:19.360
Thanks to Rocky horror.

46:19.360 --> 46:20.360
Okay.

46:20.420 --> 46:23.020
These are like little heels, but these are like straight up.

46:23.020 --> 46:26.580
Fuck me pumps that I'm wearing and they, they hurt my fucking leg.

46:26.580 --> 46:29.620
Like I will be impressed if I get through that show.

46:29.620 --> 46:31.420
Tape your first two toes together.

46:31.420 --> 46:34.980
Oh, like I'm on my feet on your feet.

46:34.980 --> 46:35.980
It will help.

46:35.980 --> 46:36.980
Okay.

46:36.980 --> 46:37.980
Good to know.

46:37.980 --> 46:38.980
Why?

46:38.980 --> 46:39.980
Why not?

46:39.980 --> 46:40.980
Everything else.

46:40.980 --> 46:41.980
My body is all laced up.

46:41.980 --> 46:42.980
Plus, plus, plus, plus, plus.

46:42.980 --> 46:48.580
You can get the, uh, ball of your heel pads that don't get the Dr. Scholl's one.

46:48.580 --> 46:51.520
Get the CVS one because they're cheaper and they do just a good job.

46:51.520 --> 46:52.520
Good to know.

46:52.520 --> 46:53.520
Trust me.

46:53.520 --> 46:56.240
JD in chat says, did you choose a drag name?

46:56.240 --> 47:01.520
Um, at the end of the day, I decided to do the Chad Michaels thing and just do Rob Roberts

47:01.520 --> 47:03.840
so that I don't, well, I didn't want to split my branding.

47:03.840 --> 47:04.840
Does that make sense?

47:04.840 --> 47:06.840
I didn't want it.

47:06.840 --> 47:10.240
And it's, it's part the Willem thing too.

47:10.240 --> 47:12.320
Is it except you're not an asshole?

47:12.320 --> 47:13.320
Well I try.

47:13.940 --> 47:20.220
But is that if this is really, really well received and it's like, Hey Rob, we want to

47:20.220 --> 47:23.820
give you a paid gig, but you should do it in a dress cause it would be funny.

47:23.820 --> 47:26.060
Then it's like, I have no, I'll do the Eddie Izzard thing.

47:26.060 --> 47:27.780
I have no, no problem with it.

47:27.780 --> 47:28.780
Whatever.

47:28.780 --> 47:29.780
It is what it is.

47:29.780 --> 47:30.780
Gender is a construct.

47:30.780 --> 47:31.780
Tear it apart.

47:31.780 --> 47:37.620
Uh, actually I know, um, a local queen comedian I could put you in contact with.

47:37.620 --> 47:38.620
So okay.

47:38.620 --> 47:39.620
If you were interested.

47:39.620 --> 47:40.620
You never know.

47:40.620 --> 47:41.620
You never know.

47:41.620 --> 47:44.600
Rob Roberts says, I have laced many a cosplayer in a corset.

47:44.600 --> 47:50.780
I legit understand, but Rama, until you've been in that corset, which you don't have

47:50.780 --> 47:54.560
to say in chat if you have or not, I'm just saying, until you've been in that corset,

47:54.560 --> 47:56.480
you don't really know.

47:56.480 --> 47:57.480
Just say it.

47:57.480 --> 47:58.480
That's it.

47:58.480 --> 48:01.840
I want to see Ron Chan do bust out some Akane cosplay.

48:01.840 --> 48:02.840
All right.

48:02.840 --> 48:06.760
Saying like sexy cross play Luigi.

48:06.760 --> 48:11.440
If I would do that, if that's what makes them happy, then sure.

48:11.440 --> 48:12.720
All right.

48:12.720 --> 48:16.260
But in the meantime, there's so many people out there probably listening going, I thought

48:16.260 --> 48:18.500
this was a video game podcast.

48:18.500 --> 48:25.820
It is, but sometimes you play video games and corset and heels and that's fine.

48:25.820 --> 48:26.820
You know what?

48:26.820 --> 48:27.820
I've decided.

48:27.820 --> 48:28.820
What?

48:28.820 --> 48:29.820
I'm going to do girl Mario.

48:29.820 --> 48:30.820
Maria.

48:30.820 --> 48:31.820
Maria?

48:31.820 --> 48:32.820
For what?

48:32.820 --> 48:33.820
Maria.

48:33.820 --> 48:34.820
Like a-

48:34.820 --> 48:35.820
For maybe Saconomy.

48:35.820 --> 48:38.500
Mag West is coming up, but man, it's on a, it's on a busy fucking weekend.

48:38.500 --> 48:39.500
Mag West.

48:39.560 --> 48:45.320
I got shit going on, but I've been wanting to do Sacanime and I'm going to try to remake

48:45.320 --> 48:50.360
my Grey Warden, but actually I'm redoing my Jill Valentine.

48:50.360 --> 48:55.220
You remember my very, very first cosplay that I did out here was my Jill costume.

48:55.220 --> 49:00.900
I am going to remake my Jill Valentine costume now that I am probably a good four sizes smaller

49:00.900 --> 49:05.200
than when I did it last time, which by the way, today marks a hundred pounds down.

49:05.200 --> 49:06.200
Really?

49:06.200 --> 49:09.360
All you have to do now is find two giant slices of bread.

49:09.360 --> 49:11.640
Do you want me to die?

49:11.640 --> 49:13.360
I ate pizza the other day.

49:13.360 --> 49:15.680
No, to be a Jill sandwich.

49:15.680 --> 49:16.680
Right.

49:16.680 --> 49:20.240
All right.

49:20.240 --> 49:25.400
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

49:25.400 --> 49:28.080
use the passphrase, fun.

49:28.080 --> 49:30.840
Let's get into some video game news.

49:30.840 --> 49:33.160
Believe it or not, we have some around here.

49:33.160 --> 49:37.080
Starting off with a game that's kind of a pleasant surprise to see back in the news,

49:37.080 --> 49:38.080
right?

49:38.080 --> 49:39.080
Exactly.

49:39.080 --> 49:41.920
Like it's about time that the game came out that I bought.

49:41.920 --> 49:43.120
Was it two years ago?

49:43.120 --> 49:44.120
One year ago?

49:44.120 --> 49:52.600
I can't remember when this came out originally, but No Man's Sky Next is getting its due time.

49:52.600 --> 49:55.040
I guess they're releasing it now.

49:55.040 --> 49:56.820
It's going to be coming to the Xbox.

49:56.820 --> 50:00.400
And what does No Man's Sky Next add to the game?

50:00.400 --> 50:02.300
Well, true multiplayer.

50:02.300 --> 50:07.660
So not this like, oh, hey, I'm in the same place as you are, or I see a glowing thing

50:07.660 --> 50:08.860
or something like that.

50:08.860 --> 50:13.380
No, you actually will see the actual people that you're playing with.

50:13.380 --> 50:20.180
So they're going to have third person options, true multiplayer, ringed planets.

50:20.180 --> 50:22.420
Also there's going to be a visual overhaul.

50:22.420 --> 50:27.980
You can build bases on any planet and you'll be able to assemble and upgrade a fleet of

50:27.980 --> 50:32.620
frigates and command them from the bridge of your freighter.

50:32.620 --> 50:34.020
So that's pretty awesome.

50:34.020 --> 50:41.580
So that'll be coming out, of course, on PlayStation 4 and PC on July 24th and will be releasing

50:41.580 --> 50:44.740
on Xbox One, which includes everything.

50:44.740 --> 50:46.060
So hurry.

50:46.060 --> 50:47.140
I can't wait to try it.

50:47.140 --> 50:51.580
And if you already own the game, which many of you do, this is going to be just a free

50:51.580 --> 50:53.500
free update, free update.

50:53.500 --> 50:56.820
Just like they've done several big updates.

50:56.820 --> 50:57.820
It's crazy.

50:57.820 --> 51:00.500
I haven't played it since they did any of those updates.

51:00.500 --> 51:05.560
So I'm very looking forward to going back to play super update and it's going to look

51:05.560 --> 51:07.860
awesome because 4K TV.

51:07.860 --> 51:08.860
Yeah.

51:08.860 --> 51:10.460
So I'm looking forward to that.

51:10.460 --> 51:11.460
Nice.

51:11.460 --> 51:12.460
Yeah.

51:12.460 --> 51:13.460
I'm, I'm excited to check this out again.

51:13.460 --> 51:18.180
You know, I, I did check it out not a terribly long time ago, probably after their last big

51:18.180 --> 51:22.680
update, but I'm, you know, I'm excited for a chance to go back and revisit this game.

51:22.680 --> 51:27.320
I do love that they, you know, have done this as a free, you know, update.

51:27.320 --> 51:31.440
I'm not sure where the money's coming from to have sustained that studio for two years.

51:31.440 --> 51:35.880
I guess the game is selling well enough, even in a lot of the markdown prices or when it

51:35.880 --> 51:41.040
first came out or what have you, um, that they had enough money to kind of pour back

51:41.040 --> 51:45.680
maybe additional sales on PC and now on Xbox One, I mean, that's a whole new audience.

51:45.680 --> 51:49.680
So I guess, but you know, most studios would have, you know, taken the money imported into

51:49.680 --> 51:50.680
a new project.

51:50.680 --> 51:56.100
So it's pretty cool that they've, you know, kind of committed themselves to making a more

51:56.100 --> 51:57.720
fully realized game.

51:57.720 --> 51:59.080
Well, here's the thing.

51:59.080 --> 52:01.160
I never hated the game to begin with.

52:01.160 --> 52:07.240
Like it wasn't a 10 out of 10 to me, but I didn't allow myself to buy into all that hype.

52:07.240 --> 52:08.240
And you know that.

52:08.240 --> 52:09.240
Right.

52:09.240 --> 52:10.240
Yeah.

52:10.240 --> 52:11.520
Cause it was all about like, Oh, let's get to the center of the universe and you get

52:11.520 --> 52:16.480
to the center of the universe and it's like, Oh, and there's nothing there.

52:16.480 --> 52:18.960
Well, but here's, here's the thing.

52:18.960 --> 52:22.540
You know, that there was all that lead up with all this and I was sitting here saying,

52:22.540 --> 52:23.540
so where's the game?

52:23.540 --> 52:24.540
Where's the fucking game?

52:24.540 --> 52:25.540
You know what?

52:25.540 --> 52:27.140
I don't care anymore until they show us the game.

52:27.140 --> 52:31.420
So you know, by the time the game finally came out, I feel like since I didn't really

52:31.420 --> 52:39.200
have expectations, I enjoyed it for what it was, which for me was more of like a Zen Minecraft

52:39.200 --> 52:40.960
type of experience.

52:40.960 --> 52:45.340
You know, and I think a lot of people made this narrative based on, you know, what the

52:45.340 --> 52:48.600
developers were saying at the time and putting out there in the media, which they've certainly

52:48.600 --> 52:51.860
learned their lessons since then was they were looking for probably more like an action

52:51.860 --> 52:55.200
space game, which I never was expecting ever.

52:55.200 --> 52:59.440
I liked the Zen Minecraft part of it, but there just wasn't a lot to do on any of the

52:59.440 --> 53:00.440
planets originally.

53:00.440 --> 53:05.800
And, and if you wanted to just sit there and mine a plan and build stuff or whatever, well,

53:05.800 --> 53:10.420
then you have to fend off all the robot centuries that don't like you mining the planet, even

53:10.420 --> 53:14.740
if you go to a peaceful planet or it's like, Oh, Hey, look at all this inventory shuffling

53:14.740 --> 53:15.740
I have to do.

53:15.740 --> 53:21.220
And that was fixed several updates ago, but you know, I'm talking about when I first played

53:21.220 --> 53:26.460
it and my last memory of it, which was like, Oh, well I can't stack any of this stuff and

53:26.460 --> 53:32.060
Oh, my ship's out of fuel now and better go mine some fuel and I don't go to this other

53:32.060 --> 53:33.060
planet.

53:33.060 --> 53:35.180
Oh, look, it's the same shit.

53:35.180 --> 53:39.140
So I'm excited to try it again and I'm curious to see how the multiplayer component works

53:39.140 --> 53:40.140
out.

53:40.140 --> 53:45.040
Like, I'm not really going to go seeking out other people, but I'm curious, like if somebody's

53:45.040 --> 53:48.480
on the same planet as you, is it going to come up on like your radar?

53:48.480 --> 53:54.360
Like there's another player like on this planet, but you know, again, it's an entire fucking

53:54.360 --> 53:55.360
planet.

53:55.360 --> 53:59.360
So like, just because somebody is on that planet, they could be, you know, so far away

53:59.360 --> 54:00.360
from you.

54:00.360 --> 54:01.360
Yeah.

54:01.360 --> 54:02.360
If there's like billions of planets.

54:02.360 --> 54:03.360
Yeah.

54:03.360 --> 54:04.360
I know it's going to be interesting to see how that all works.

54:04.360 --> 54:06.720
So, uh, I'll be, I'll be revisiting the game again.

54:06.720 --> 54:07.720
I know I will.

54:07.720 --> 54:08.720
So, uh, very cool.

54:08.720 --> 54:09.720
What about you?

54:09.720 --> 54:10.720
You know, you can pick up the wind sky again.

54:10.720 --> 54:11.720
Play that.

54:11.720 --> 54:12.720
Oh, yeah.

54:12.720 --> 54:13.720
I'll try it.

54:13.720 --> 54:14.720
If I ever get the TV again.

54:15.400 --> 54:17.120
I was hoping that they do like a VR mode for it.

54:17.120 --> 54:19.320
You know, maybe that would be cool.

54:19.320 --> 54:20.320
Maybe.

54:20.320 --> 54:23.880
Uh, as she went under Matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I really wanted

54:23.880 --> 54:27.960
the game to be like the spaceship parts of the book version of ready player one.

54:27.960 --> 54:32.960
Uh, cause you don't chat says devs don't like to abandon their games these days.

54:32.960 --> 54:33.960
That's part of the problem.

54:33.960 --> 54:37.760
I miss the good old days when a dev would just run off and leave the game open for mods

54:37.760 --> 54:38.760
to have fun with.

54:38.760 --> 54:39.760
Oh, don't worry.

54:39.760 --> 54:40.920
There's plenty of companies out there.

54:40.920 --> 54:42.000
They'll abandon their games.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
No problem.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.320
So that's, there's not an issue.

54:44.920 --> 54:45.920
There's plenty of games.

54:45.920 --> 54:51.560
Uh, EA would like to, uh, woo you to download origin cause you don't, um, but, uh, I mean,

54:51.560 --> 54:56.840
I kinda like, I kinda get what you're saying, but at the same time, this isn't the first

54:56.840 --> 55:00.280
time that we've seen developers stick with a game they really believe in either.

55:00.280 --> 55:05.040
Like I think Diablo three is probably the biggest example of a game that they did turn

55:05.040 --> 55:07.240
around a couple of years after release.

55:07.240 --> 55:11.120
You know, Diablo three now is not anything like it was when it first released.

55:11.120 --> 55:12.800
And uh, it's, it's a lot of fun to play now.

55:12.800 --> 55:16.720
I still play Diablo three here and there, but when that game first released, it was,

55:16.720 --> 55:17.720
it was sloppy.

55:17.720 --> 55:21.560
Uh, which for a big series like Diablo was a really ugly thing.

55:21.560 --> 55:25.160
So do you think Diablo four this year at Blizzcon or?

55:25.160 --> 55:32.280
I want to believe just like another expansion, like, like, like an X files poster, but with,

55:32.280 --> 55:38.640
you know, a demon hunter instead of a UFO, I want to believe, um, but I, no, I don't

55:38.640 --> 55:40.320
think it'll be another expansion.

55:40.360 --> 55:44.280
It would be weird at this point to have another expansion when the necromancer wasn't really

55:44.280 --> 55:45.280
an expansion.

55:45.280 --> 55:49.160
I know they call it the necromancer expansion, but it wasn't, it wasn't a real expansion.

55:49.160 --> 55:50.160
You know what I mean?

55:50.160 --> 55:54.000
I think Diablo three, it's time to close the book on it and go to Diablo four, whether

55:54.000 --> 55:59.680
it's this year, the announced, maybe I want to believe, okay, but the game won't be out

55:59.680 --> 56:00.680
this year.

56:00.680 --> 56:01.680
So it won't matter.

56:01.680 --> 56:02.680
They can announce it this year.

56:02.680 --> 56:06.280
It won't actually come out till 2020 probably it'll be on the next stage of consoles.

56:06.280 --> 56:07.280
We'll see.

56:07.680 --> 56:10.600
And then of course Final Fantasy 14 was another game they really turned around, but like,

56:10.600 --> 56:15.200
I feel like the Final Fantasy 14 that's out now, like wasn't even the same game that was

56:15.200 --> 56:16.200
originally released.

56:16.200 --> 56:17.800
Still waiting for 11 on mobile.

56:17.800 --> 56:22.480
But the interesting thing about 14's original release, like No Man's Sky, they continued

56:22.480 --> 56:27.600
to patch the shit out of that original Final Fantasy 14 until they finally were ready to

56:27.600 --> 56:32.480
pull the plug on it and begin the makeover for Realm Reborn, which caused the game to

56:32.480 --> 56:35.640
be down for like, I don't know, it was like eight weeks or something when they, before

56:35.680 --> 56:40.440
they launched Realm Reborn, which, you know, was, is now I think the best MMO out there

56:40.440 --> 56:45.060
right now is, is 14 or hell let's just, let's upgrade 11 with better graphics.

56:45.060 --> 56:48.880
Just keep it all the same since it's going to be on mobile platforms anyways and bring

56:48.880 --> 56:49.880
it to switch.

56:49.880 --> 56:55.280
Uh, one more comment here on No Man's Sky Dungeon Buster says, once you get settled

56:55.280 --> 57:00.720
into a routine of mining, resupplying, flying repeat, it got really boring, but the huge

57:00.720 --> 57:03.840
content patches have added a lot more since then.

57:04.600 --> 57:09.360
Some other comments on patching, Dungeon Buster says they're still adding free content to

57:09.360 --> 57:10.960
Monster Hunter World too.

57:10.960 --> 57:11.960
Same with The Division.

57:11.960 --> 57:12.960
Yeah, that's always.

57:12.960 --> 57:17.160
Well, I mean, we have a story later on, I think about Mario Kart 8, you know, a lot

57:17.160 --> 57:19.880
of games are getting like patching updates, which is pretty cool.

57:19.880 --> 57:25.200
S21 Hunter Matt suggesting how to change your 4K TV monopolization problems.

57:25.200 --> 57:27.880
Loki needs a gamer cave with his own TV.

57:27.880 --> 57:31.440
Okay, let me just add on to the house because you get the garage.

57:31.440 --> 57:32.440
Well, here's what's going to happen.

57:33.040 --> 57:38.440
Well, I already do have the hot ass fucking garage to work out in and play DDR in.

57:38.440 --> 57:42.440
It's 110 degrees in there when I'm playing DDR.

57:42.440 --> 57:43.440
Let's just put it this way.

57:43.440 --> 57:45.640
I'm soaking wet.

57:45.640 --> 57:50.640
Like I have to literally, I can't wear a shirt on and it's just soaking wet, which is gross,

57:50.640 --> 57:51.640
but it works.

57:51.640 --> 57:53.080
Here's what's going to actually happens.

57:53.080 --> 57:56.640
Our old TV is going in our bedroom and our old TV still has all the streaming stuff on

57:56.640 --> 58:02.080
it so we can, she can watch it on there because she even discovered the other day because

58:02.120 --> 58:09.440
she's been using Prime Video and Prime Video kind of sucks, but, you know, Prime Video

58:09.440 --> 58:14.120
have to either go through our new TV or my PlayStation 4 and because it wasn't on the

58:14.120 --> 58:18.760
other app, but she found that the house is on the NBC app, which is weird because I thought

58:18.760 --> 58:19.760
it was on Fox.

58:19.760 --> 58:22.920
I'm not sure why it's on NBC, but it's on NBC now.

58:22.920 --> 58:25.600
So she's like, oh, they're all the episodes are right here too.

58:25.600 --> 58:27.520
I guess I don't need to go through the Prime app anymore.

58:27.520 --> 58:28.520
I'm like, uh-huh.

58:28.520 --> 58:29.520
Get off the TV.

58:30.520 --> 58:33.520
So I will eventually get a TV back.

58:33.520 --> 58:38.840
All I have to do is ask too, but I, I've been mainly trying to focus on actually doing programming

58:38.840 --> 58:44.640
and stuff and building something because I know everybody wants me to and I, you know,

58:44.640 --> 58:45.840
I'll get around to it.

58:45.840 --> 58:50.440
If I really want to play No Man's Sky, like if that was like, I was dying to do it, I'd

58:50.440 --> 58:54.040
just download it on a PC and play it on my PC.

58:54.040 --> 58:55.040
All right.

58:55.560 --> 58:59.600
Well, speaking of, uh, Mario Kart, uh, I know this was, uh, something that was going around

58:59.600 --> 59:00.600
this week.

59:00.600 --> 59:05.440
I think this is because of, uh, Comic-Con, but there are some Mario Kart Hot Wheels that

59:05.440 --> 59:06.680
are going to be coming.

59:06.680 --> 59:12.720
So didn't we get like, uh, we had like Atari influenced Hot Wheels was the thing.

59:12.720 --> 59:16.840
Well, they have Mario flavored Hot Wheels right now.

59:16.840 --> 59:21.240
In fact, I actually saw some at GameStop when we were just stopping by there today, but

59:21.240 --> 59:25.320
they're like, these are, they're like, you know, Mario paint jobs on like regular car.

59:25.320 --> 59:29.960
Oh no, these are full on, like the carts with the characters in them.

59:29.960 --> 59:33.560
These are like full on, uh, actual like car racers.

59:33.560 --> 59:35.920
Anyway, uh, Mattel partner with Nintendo to do this.

59:35.920 --> 59:36.920
They are licensed toys.

59:36.920 --> 59:38.560
They're going to be out in 2019.

59:38.560 --> 59:42.560
Uh, they were viewable at San Diego Comic-Con, which was probably like the big thing that

59:42.560 --> 59:43.560
was going on this weekend.

59:43.560 --> 59:47.680
Uh, unfortunately I don't think everybody's getting a release cause there's a lot of characters

59:47.680 --> 59:52.240
in Mario Kart, but you will be able to get Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Wario, Rosalina,

59:52.240 --> 59:53.820
Toad, and Yoshi.

59:53.820 --> 59:57.920
Hot Wheels are also going to be making tracks inspired by various Mario Kart courses.

59:57.920 --> 01:00:04.160
The cars will be $5, uh, each coming out June of 2019.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:09.440
So expensive, cheaper than an amiibo.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.440
I don't know.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.440
I, I'm still tempted.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.440
I think they look really cool.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.920
You think, I think your kids would be into these.

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:14.920
Wouldn't they?

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:15.920
Oh yeah.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.280
They always like beg me for Hot Wheels.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.400
We have a whole bucket of Hot Wheels that they don't play with.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.400
They're not Mario.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:26.440
Well, we have like Hot Wheels, like, okay, so like when I was playing, I used to play

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:27.440
with Hot Wheels all the time.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:32.160
I used to have miles of that like orange track that actually is my dad's track.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:35.900
Uh, when he had, when he was a kid, just to tell you how old that stuff is.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:40.680
So like we would play with that and actually build our own courses.

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:43.400
But now when you buy the track, first off, it's fucking expensive.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.700
And second, all of the like track that you can buy is in a set.

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:51.520
Always does something weird and funky and it's just like, you can't loop it with the

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.520
rest of it.

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:55.680
It's like we have one right now that like it goes in like a figure eight really fast

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.480
and then they crashed into each other and it's really boring, but it's also fucking

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:02.940
loud and takes up a ton of fucking space.

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:04.320
So that's why we don't play with it.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:08.340
Uh, cause you do in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, will there be shortages?

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:09.920
And then we have to find them on eBay.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:12.160
Um, Hot Wheels, no, this is Mattel.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.600
They fucking know how to manufacture shit.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.240
This isn't Nintendo manufacturing this.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.240
There'll be no problems.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:22.440
Well, but are they going to be able to, I mean, what's the demand going to be like and

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.560
will they be able to anticipate that demand?

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:27.080
I mean, I don't really know.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:32.640
I don't normally seek out specific Hot Wheels, so I'm not really sure, but I would imagine

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:37.880
that Mattel's got the manufacturing thing down and they'll, they'll play this fake shortage

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:38.880
bullshit.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:39.880
All right.

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.680
Some other comments on, uh, the, uh, desirability in our chat.

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:48.000
So maybe Mattel better get ready with a lot of these cause Rama says, I legit want them.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.520
Uh, Dartetsuya says, I thought those were neat.

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:54.340
Definitely spoke to my inner child and me and now lol used to collect die cast cars

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.340
like you wouldn't believe.

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:59.800
I do want the toad cart and our buddy captain spike from game buoy.org.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:00.800
Hello.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:06.120
Says simply want in all caps and that's a, we actually do collect Hot Wheels.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.120
Do you?

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:11.760
We collect all the Mustangs and all the Fiat's on a scale of one to want.

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:14.240
How do you feel about the, uh, Mario Kart Hot Wheels?

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:20.040
I'm actually kind of indifferent just because, um, we're not like as big on it as we used

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.040
to be.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:25.440
Um, it'd be nice to have, but I mean the last things that, you know, I'll pick up Deanna

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:29.840
Mustang every so often, you know, cause he loves his Mustangs and I'll pick up a Fiat

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:32.400
when I find it, but I don't know.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.120
It just seems like it'd be more stuff that would take up more space in my already overrun

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.560
toy house.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:41.840
There's a part of me that wants to get at least one or two just to see if Mr. Smoosh

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.920
will chase it around the house.

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:44.920
Okay.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:45.920
Story time.

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:46.920
Okay.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:55.040
Dan used to love chasing Shermy around the house with our RC, um, uh, initial D cars.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:59.280
You remember those ones that used to sell at all the anime conventions and then we had

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:05.600
also a RC Coro Q cars and we would chase Shermy around with them until she realized stairs.

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:10.680
And that's my story about Shermy, rest in peace.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:11.680
All right.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:12.680
Um, well Jamie, why you got the mic?

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:15.000
Why don't we move on to the next story?

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.720
Whale speaking of some Nintendo, you know, they were going to do a game.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:25.000
Well, it was canceled eight years ago, but it would have been the last Tingle thing to

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.580
release and it was going to be a scary game.

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:36.620
And it was supposed to be where Tingle goes into a wizard of Oz esque storybook and he

01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:41.780
has to dance with the realms princess to escape.

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:45.700
First of all, Tingle is scary all on his own.

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:51.820
They were working with a van pool and this is according to the producer, uh, Tana Bekinski,

01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:54.660
um, who gave this out.

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:57.220
So, um, weird.

01:03:57.220 --> 01:03:59.940
Um, I don't, I don't know.

01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:04.420
I mean, they did a Tingle game that came out with, um, what was it?

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:09.320
Four swords, Avengers that came out in Japan with, with it, um, that we never saw the light

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:15.740
of day over here officially, um, four swords, Avengers.

01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:16.740
Yeah.

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:17.740
They have four swords game.

01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:18.740
It was a free download.

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:21.060
It was the Tetris game.

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.260
I don't know.

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:24.460
Maybe it was the Tetra game that didn't come with it.

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.460
Nevermind.

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:30.580
But, um, but anyway, uh, we have no Tingle, scary, weird game.

01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:32.300
Well, that's disappointing.

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:34.300
Would you have played a Silent Hill starring Tingle?

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:37.220
It doesn't seem like it'd be very Silent Hill.

01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:39.300
It just seemed like it would just be weird.

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:42.300
Uh, going to chat at live.vognetwork.com.

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:43.300
Silent Mushroom Kingdom.

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:45.900
S2100 Matt says Tingle murder party.

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:48.020
Wait, it would be Silent Hyrule.

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:51.260
Uh, JD says any game starring Tingle is a horror game.

01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:56.060
Speaking of horror games, I found, I have some of the Burger King games still, oh, like

01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:57.060
sneak King.

01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.060
I don't have sneaking.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:01.980
I have the motor cycle racing game, which I don't know why I don't have sneak King.

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:03.500
Cause I would have totally kept that.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:09.060
So I don't know where that is, but I have the, the motor, the mini bike racing one.

01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:12.060
Are those backwards compatible on Xbox one and the whole thing?

01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:14.660
Um, well the, their expert, I don't know if they're backwards compatible.

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:19.060
I know they, their Xbox, the original Xbox and the mini bike racing one.

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:24.260
Their Xbox, the original Xbox and Xbox 360 on one disc, which is kind of unique.

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:25.260
Oh yeah.

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:26.260
That's right.

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:27.260
I forgot they were original Xbox.

01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:28.260
Yeah.

01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:29.260
Yeah.

01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:30.260
Yeah.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.260
Interesting.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:34.300
By the way, there's something else that I remembered about figures and toys that are,

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:39.020
they announced at, uh, comic con golden girls action figures, Rob.

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:40.020
Oh yeah.

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:43.460
There, there's like golden girls, nostalgia is at an all time high.

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:48.380
I've been getting links on my wall about like Pez dispensers and like, like every, you used

01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:50.140
to have quite the Pez dispenser collection.

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:51.340
I did back in the day.

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:52.340
They're all kind of in a drawer now.

01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:57.460
I don't really have them on display or anymore, but um, yeah, uh, I mean, here's the thing.

01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:58.460
I love the golden girls.

01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:02.620
It will always be one of my favorite shows ever, but like I'm finding with all these,

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:06.180
um, all these things that they have, I'm starting to hit my limit.

01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:07.180
You know what I mean?

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:09.300
Like I, I don't need every single fucking golden girl.

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:10.500
You know what's next, right?

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:11.500
What?

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.500
Designing women.

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:13.500
Yeah.

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:16.740
I know justice for, hashtag justice for designing women.

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:18.420
We're going to have the Delta Burke pop.

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:24.020
It is an underappreciated like, you know, eighties slash nineties, uh, classic.

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:25.020
Yeah.

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:29.980
We need like a Delta Burke and uh, um, God, what was her name that the play Julia Sugar

01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:33.300
Baker, like the, the lead in that show, I don't remember her name.

01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:36.780
Not Delta Burke cause they wrote her out and it was the Charlene character.

01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.860
That show was good.

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:41.140
It was, that's what I found with like my, my new TV.

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:44.860
They have this thing called the Roku channel cause it has a built in Roku inside of it

01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:49.780
and the Roku channel, for those who are not aware, has a bunch of old shit that you would

01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:52.600
just never think that somebody would license.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:57.820
So it has like old TV and old movies, really weird, random shit that's on there.

01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:03.860
For example, it has, see, it has the complete series of Elf or it has,

01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:05.940
Elf had a really weird ending.

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:13.260
Or it has, um, the complete series of Grace Under Fire or, uh, what was the other weird

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:16.580
show that was on there that was, I was like, well, that's odd.

01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:19.060
Has short circuit too, but not the first short circuit.

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:20.060
Sorry.

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:21.060
Important interruption.

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:22.060
Dixie Carter.

01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.260
Why couldn't I fucking remember that?

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:24.260
Dixie Carter.

01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:25.260
Okay, sorry.

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:26.260
Yeah.

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:28.220
So like a bunch of weird stuff that I went through and go, I'm going to make my kids

01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:34.620
watch this and they're going to hate me for it, but I don't care because it's Elf.

01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:37.140
Elf is pretty cool except the part where he tries to eat cats.

01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:38.780
I don't like that.

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:41.780
I don't like that, but he never did actually get to eat a cat.

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:43.540
So I think that's, that's good.

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:48.180
Apparently the people who were on that show hated being on it because of all the holes

01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:50.300
that they had to do the puppet through.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:51.300
Oh, Alf.

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:52.300
Yeah.

01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:53.300
Oh God.

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:54.300
I can only imagine.

01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:55.300
Yeah.

01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:56.300
But the ending was such a downer.

01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:57.700
Oh gosh.

01:07:57.700 --> 01:07:58.700
I watched it live.

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:00.420
I'm like, I was scarred for life.

01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:04.980
Captain Spike is asking what service was this?

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:06.580
It's just the, it's Roku.

01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:11.020
And so Roku has their own channel called the Roku channel and it has a bunch of free stuff.

01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:14.140
I think it's all like sponsored by Geico or something like that.

01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:15.620
It's just random shit.

01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:20.300
Like they have all sorts of random movies on there and random TV shows.

01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:21.300
I'll take random TV shows.

01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:22.300
Yeah.

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:24.420
I was like, I was like, it's free.

01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:29.140
I'm not complaining about free short circuit to cool, which they had the first one, but

01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:30.260
I remember too.

01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:35.240
Uh, where, where could I find a old episodes of a small wonder?

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:40.500
That's another internet where where's, where's our like Harriet dolls.

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:44.820
They have like, was it Harriet was the neighbor Vicki Vicki was like, I think, I think they

01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:46.260
had like Adam's family on there.

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:48.940
They had like a bunch of like Nick at night stuff on there too.

01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:50.900
Like I dream a genie was on there.

01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:52.700
Like it just random shit.

01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:54.380
I don't know.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:55.380
Anyway.

01:08:55.380 --> 01:09:00.340
Uh, they're, they're talking about a downer endings in our chat room at live.com cause

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:02.420
the Alf sitcom had a downer ending.

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:07.540
Uh, and then, uh, act deaf to saying dinosaurs series ending though.

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:08.540
That was a downer.

01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:10.620
I don't even remember the end of that one.

01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:12.740
Uh, spoiler alert.

01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:15.020
If I remember right, a comet hits the earth and kills them all.

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:16.020
I guess that makes sense.

01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:17.020
Yeah.

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:18.540
Cause that's kind of what happens.

01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:19.540
Yeah.

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:20.540
If I remember, am I right on that?

01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:22.340
I just remember that was the thing.

01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:26.740
Like a comet hits the earth, kills them all.

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:27.740
Which why are we laughing?

01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:28.740
It's not funny.

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:36.540
Remember when all the dinosaurs died?

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:38.540
All right.

01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:39.540
Anyway.

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:45.340
Oh, active says an ice age happens and they're realizing that they will die a slow frozen

01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:46.340
death.

01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:47.340
I was close.

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:48.340
Oh, that's even better.

01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:49.340
I was close.

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:50.340
That's even funnier.

01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:51.340
All right.

01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:53.340
Anyway.

01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:54.340
Let's move on.

01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:55.340
Loki, what do you have for us?

01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:56.340
All right.

01:09:56.340 --> 01:10:02.540
So, um, splatoon two, unfortunately a lot of the games on the switch are running into

01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:03.540
hacker issues.

01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:08.540
Um, and apparently splatoon two is one of these games that's actually pretty easy for

01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:10.340
players to hack.

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:15.340
So what did one, um, hacker do to splatoon two?

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:21.780
Well, they took, um, the leaderboard for competitive play and put up, they got the top four spots

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:28.840
and spelled out, please add anti-cheat basically said it wasn't just a joke.

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:34.540
They wanted to send a message to Nintendo about how easy it is to hack their game.

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:40.040
So yeah, because you know, now with all the mods and stuff that they have for the switch,

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:45.940
it's easy for them to modify the game and be able to, you know, do all sorts of nonsense

01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:46.940
in there.

01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:49.140
I'll show you hacks the planet.

01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:50.140
Yeah.

01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:54.740
So, I mean, did Nintendo like fix this already or what?

01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.160
No, not yet.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.160
Not yet.

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.160
They probably will.

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.360
And by the time this show is airing, I'm sure it will pretty well.

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:01.360
They've done it.

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:06.160
Well, they fixed it by removing the hacker's message, um, and says, but the recent update,

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:10.760
there's no signs of anti-cheat measures that have been added into the game and says what

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:11.760
they should do.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:16.320
And in the least is to add parameters, to check things like they did in the first game,

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.180
the correct misconfigured parameters.

01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:22.480
When someone joins a game on top of that, the game should have various sanity checks

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:23.480
during gameplay.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:29.080
So basically, you know, like to verify that, Oh, the rate of fire of your rocket there

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:35.120
isn't like, you know, it's a consistent amount and not like 80 times per second or something

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:36.120
like that.

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:41.540
Um, let's see, uh, going to chat at live.vognetwork.com, uh, dar Tetsuya says, I heard the guy got

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:42.540
banned.

01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:43.540
So I don't know if that counts.

01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:44.540
Oh yes.

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:45.540
Thank you.

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:48.000
You know, of course, because he won't come back under it with a new hat.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.720
Well, it's still, it's, I understand like the guy wasn't trying to be destructive about

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:53.720
it.

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.200
He's like trying to tell him, Hey, you need to fix something.

01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:00.280
And so how they reward that by fucking banning him, uh, going to chat here, here's another

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:01.660
comment about eighties TV.

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:02.660
You ready?

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:03.660
All right.

01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:04.660
I'm ready.

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:07.240
Uh, I had two in our chat, which is a, I don't recognize that name.

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.240
So welcome.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.240
Hello.

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:13.140
I had two and Chad says, I have a channel here in Richmond called antenna TV that has

01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:16.880
small wonder soap, Mr. Belvedere Benson.

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.100
It's pretty rad.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:20.200
You know, that's, that's a good point.

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:25.400
Is that a lot of these like random fucking shit is ever since they converted from the

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:30.120
analog to the digital, because it got so much easier to do digital stations like check your

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:31.120
digital stuff.

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.880
Cause I don't even know if all these exist on cable.

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:39.320
You might have to actually go to like the antenna and go to like, go to like your CBS,

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:46.480
but go to like the dot two and the dot three because there is some low budget television

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.160
happening in those places.

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:50.760
And sometimes it's just like a nonstop weather channel.

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.560
Some of them are like a nonstop news channel.

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:56.020
Uh, some of them, you know, they're just like, like different stuff.

01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:57.280
Radio does this too.

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:02.600
Uh, there's like random radio stations on the HD, but I don't think a lot of cars have

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:03.600
like the HD radio.

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:08.280
I don't, I think that's more of like a, I, my car, my old car had an HD radio tuner or

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:14.480
I had, I had a NHC radio tuner in my car and it was garbage.

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:19.640
Like I have a, I have a Prius, which is a, you know, and it's a, it's a 2016 Prius.

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:23.560
It's kind of a newer car caught on because people are like, ah, streaming services, streaming

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:30.640
services, you know, podcasts like satellite radio, putting your iPod or iPhone or whatever,

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:36.480
or Android, you know, all that stuff into the, you know, uh, car basically is, is kind

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:37.480
of the new thing.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:39.640
And everybody's using streaming Spotify or, or podcasts.

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:43.000
And I'm sure there's a lot of people that listen to us in the car on their commutes.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Hello.

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:47.840
So anyway, uh, but I was gonna say with the TV, that is so true.

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:50.960
There is a lot of that random stuff and I bet anything, the channel that he's mentioning

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.280
is probably one of those type of channels.

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:54.920
That's where buzzer comes from too.

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:58.760
Y'all know I love me some buzzer on Twitch cause they stream it on Twitch too, which

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.840
is the old ass game shows.

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:03.000
It's like seventies match game.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:09.360
And so the one over the air is the one that has like supermarket sweep and like additional

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.600
stuff that they don't even have on the Twitch one.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.040
So, and I guess somebody was telling me, I think I saw a tweet.

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:19.200
You can watch like a live feed of buzzer also on their website or something.

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:20.960
So kind of, kind of neat.

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:21.960
Anyway.

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:25.140
Uh, Tyler Kalan chat says, who listens to radio anymore?

01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:26.600
There's nothing good on it.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.240
Internet radio for the win.

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:31.320
I do once in a while.

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:36.880
And the reason why is that I do find the one thing that local TV and local radio still

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:42.960
are able to do that no one else can quite match is local news.

01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:48.600
That's the one place that they still do very well with, especially in the TV side of things

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:49.600
with radio.

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:54.820
There's just not a lot of like locally, but you know, the terrestrial radio would be very

01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:57.600
smart to embrace more of the community side of things.

01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.560
Cause that's how they get more people to listen to it.

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:03.320
I think anyway, that's my thoughts on that.

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:08.560
Um, let's move on and talk about, uh, smash brothers.

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:14.260
So a super smash brothers may be going to be getting a demo, maybe.

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:16.960
Uh, I think some of the other smash brothers games had demos.

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:20.600
I seem to remember there was one on like 3d, it was one on 3d S soon to remember.

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:26.240
Um, so anyway, uh, splatoon two and arms, they had demos, you know, to test launches

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:27.520
or whatever you want to call it.

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:31.480
Um, maybe in that sense, like it's a beta test type thing.

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:37.600
IGN, uh, talked with bill Trinen at, uh, the San Diego comic con and the response was

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.560
very good question right now.

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:41.840
They're focused very much on getting the game ready.

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:45.200
We have a few other things to talk about down the road between now and when it launches

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:50.080
in December, we'll hopefully have some news on that as we get closer to launch.

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:54.160
And uh, that could also mean, I guess the characters, they're kind of talking about,

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:56.640
you know, more characters getting revealed before December.

01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:01.000
But I think kind of like soccer, I said in that early video, don't expect like a thousand

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
new characters.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.160
Like there's probably going to be, I want 2000 new characters, be a couple more.

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.160
That's it.

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:12.800
All of the characters, uh, every single Pokemon from all of the generations in there.

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:18.480
So interesting is apparently, uh, because smash brothers ultimate is listed on the official

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:24.360
Japanese Nintendo website, 16 gigs of space is what the game is going to require.

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:27.040
They say 16 gigs or more.

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:32.000
So, um, if you're going to use internal storage for this, that's like over half your internal

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
storage.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Why?

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.640
What, what could possibly take up that much space?

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:44.880
All those fucking characters and the animations in what I assume will be 60 frames a second.

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:45.880
There's just a lot going on.

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:49.400
Anyway, it might be a good time to think about getting a micro SD card if you don't already

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:50.400
have one.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.560
I finally, I bought a micro SD card.

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:53.600
I got a 128 gigabyte one.

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.800
I think I got, I think I got a 120.

01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:56.800
I don't even know now.

01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:57.800
It was 40 bucks.

01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:58.800
Never going to be enough.

01:16:58.800 --> 01:16:59.800
It's never going to be enough.

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:00.800
It was 40 bucks.

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:05.520
And then like the very next, so I bought it at Best Buy and then the very next day was

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:12.480
that Amazon prime fuck show and it was like 19 bucks on Amazon prime, but I didn't end

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:17.080
up getting anything on the prime thing because I was like, there's this, I feel like a lot

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:21.200
of that stuff is just trying to entice me to buy shit I don't really need.

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:24.720
They had, I really just, they had a Fitbit I wanted, but I still didn't buy it.

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.880
I looked at clothes, but I didn't see anything that screamed at me.

01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:28.880
So I didn't do it.

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:31.120
They have a lot of garbage on there.

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:32.120
Anyway.

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:33.120
All right.

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:34.120
Moving on.

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:37.240
Uh, let's talk about Jamie.

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:38.240
Let's talk about you.

01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:39.240
No.

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.240
Jamie has a story for us.

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:41.240
Neopets.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:42.240
Who remembers Neopets?

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:43.240
Me.

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:44.240
Me.

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.240
Oh my God.

01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:46.240
I haven't fed my Neopet in 13 years.

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:47.240
Do you think it's dead?

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.240
Uh, they never die.

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.060
Do you think it slowly died in the ice age?

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:51.060
Like the dinosaurs?

01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:52.060
They never die.

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:58.420
But anyway, um, there, we're gonna have a return of Neopets as a mobile app that will

01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:00.460
be, uh, puzzle games.

01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:05.140
It looks like, uh, there is going to be like a Scrabble game.

01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:10.140
Um, but it is gonna be different, you know, than the Neopets account.

01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:14.100
So if you still had your Neopets account for some reason or another, yeah, you've lost

01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:15.100
all that shit.

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:17.660
But, I don't know.

01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:20.140
I mean, what are we gonna get next?

01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:22.220
Gaia online.

01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:23.220
Why not?

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:24.220
You know what?

01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:26.060
Uh, Club Penguin.

01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:28.820
I think I still have my two Gaia online accounts.

01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:29.820
Do you?

01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:30.820
Uh, Ragnaros, of course.

01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:36.380
But there actually is a Ragnaros, uh, that little, uh, Ragnarock, sorry, I'm, I'm getting

01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:40.420
my, uh, Heroes of the Storm bug, uh, crossed.

01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:44.220
Uh, yes, Ragnarock online and then there, but they have that phone game.

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:48.300
Private, well, private servers are still up, again, I'm playing, um, Idle Poring.

01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:49.300
That's it.

01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:51.700
Actually, uh, RO2 is free, still on Steam.

01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:52.820
Oh, that's cool.

01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:55.300
And it, all the music in it was done by Yoko Kanno, so.

01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:56.380
Oh, cool.

01:18:56.380 --> 01:19:01.700
So it was really cute, I mean, it, it was just more of the same, you know.

01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:04.860
So are you gonna check out the new, the Neopets Reborn?

01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:07.120
Yeah, probably, cause I like Scrabble.

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:08.780
The mutated Neopets.

01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:10.860
Well, I like word games.

01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:12.860
Hardcore Neopets.

01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:13.860
I like word games.

01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:19.260
Yes, but the only words you're able to spell are, like, violence, kill your parents, um,

01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:26.180
murder your stinky poop, worship Satan, uh, anyway, I worship Santa.

01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:27.180
I'm just kidding.

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:28.180
None of that is funny.

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:29.180
All right.

01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:30.180
Uh, Loki.

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:36.740
All right, um, so there, one of the things, the stories that came out, um, while we were

01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:40.500
out was this whole thing about aliens, Colonial Marines.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:46.420
So there was a bug in the AI that had to do with actually, it was just one thing that

01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:53.020
was misspelled, one, um, line that was misspelled in there was causing some issues where the

01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:59.140
AI didn't know which room it was in, so it couldn't react to the player in, like, very

01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:03.140
intelligent ways, and which is why, you know, the AI was really dumb.

01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:09.800
So, um, you know, fast forward to now, where that's been fixed by, you know, fixing the

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:12.340
typo in the INI file.

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:19.320
And now, Gearbox has apparently taken to putting up a, I don't know, it looks like a fake job

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:25.980
posting on their site, um, to kind of poke fun at the stupid mistake that they made.

01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:33.460
Um, so, apparently the site has a job listing for programming copy editor, specific duties

01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:41.140
of review all code for typos, desired skills and experience, enjoys finding typos, required

01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:47.040
skills and experience, click apply and pass a rigorous questionnaire located on the application.

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:52.560
The questionnaire, I guess, is referring to, um, and the listing consists of the same question

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.180
in an open text box.

01:20:54.180 --> 01:21:02.860
Please respond to the correct spelling of tether or tether, teether, I guess.

01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:07.760
I mean, yeah, haha, it's fun to poke fun at yourself, but haha, this has been broken forever

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:11.500
and you didn't fucking go through to see if you can fix the problem.

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:16.380
Like a spelling error, you would think that that would be something pretty easy to catch

01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:19.440
and you just said, fuck it, who cares?

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:24.300
So I kind of find it a little bit insulting that they poke fun at that.

01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:29.680
I'm of two mindsets because I always enjoy a company that can have that sense of like

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:31.900
self-deprecating humor a little bit.

01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:37.440
You know, who doesn't love the Wendy's social media account or, um, who else is, who else

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:44.000
is a sass on Twitter, Denny's Arby's Arby's, you know, all those, but here's the thing

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.820
in the time it took to write that clever little tweet and pace or, and post that fake job

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:53.840
posting and all that, um, you could have probably fixed this problem.

01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:54.840
You know what I mean?

01:21:54.840 --> 01:22:00.180
Like, well, I mean, obviously this was an incredibly simple thing to fix and it's, it's

01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:02.860
really weird that it just was not found.

01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:03.860
I just don't understand.

01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:06.180
Like, did, did no one like go through that?

01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:08.400
I mean, well, and here's the thing that I don't understand too.

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:13.400
On top of that, it's like, okay, you built this game and you shipped the game.

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:17.280
You obviously, I assume you tested the game.

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:20.000
Didn't you see that there was something fucking wrong with it?

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
And like, wouldn't you think, okay, this is AI related.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.880
I'm going to talk to the guy that built, you know, the AI portion of this engine or whatever

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:31.180
and figure out, let's see if we can get down to what the issue is.

01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:35.240
Like did, it seems like no one fucking did anything.

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:36.240
Here's the thing.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:42.780
A lot of times in the industry, my understanding is that some bugs are reported and an executive

01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:46.660
decision is made to keep the game on track to release a certain time.

01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:47.660
They don't fix them.

01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:50.900
Just, it just depends on the severity of the bug, what it does and all that stuff.

01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:53.580
Some bugs don't get fixed and it is a choice.

01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:59.620
The weird thing about this though, this like with this easy of a fix as it is, it's not

01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:03.300
like we're talking about, you have to go in and like fix all this.

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:08.840
This is a very, it's one character, like I could probably, I could fix an INI file.

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:11.840
If I can fucking do it, they can fucking do it.

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:20.180
So it is really weird to me how that whole thing like snuck through, like that's a disaster.

01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:23.840
As we were talking about earlier, you know, someone mentioned that, oh, hey, why don't

01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:26.880
developers just abandon their game and not fix stuff?

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:27.880
Boom.

01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:28.880
There you go.

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:29.880
Gearbox.

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:30.880
They're your man.

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:35.660
You know that they're there for you to not fix shit.

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:37.660
There you go.

01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:39.220
Look forward to Borderlands 3.

01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:45.580
All right, anyway, speaking of typos ruining everything, some people really perked up this

01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:49.960
week when apparently Microsoft said that there was going to be an announcement with all new

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:56.020
Xbox hardware and people were like, well, it is time for Gamescom.

01:23:56.020 --> 01:24:00.860
So I mean, even though it's a weird time for a company to announce new hardware, what is

01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:03.720
what is the traditional calendar for this stuff anymore?

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:04.720
Right?

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:08.000
Remember, the switch came out in March and it did great.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.980
So timetables for game consoles even are screwed up these days.

01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:15.160
So a lot of people perked up and said, why?

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:19.840
Microsoft's going to be like doing the new console this early or doing something.

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:21.660
Well, here's the deal.

01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:24.840
It was kind of a typo, basically.

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:31.260
So what ended up happening is that Major Nelson put out a tweet that said the wording

01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:36.560
in the original post that said all new hardware and accessories was inaccurate.

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:41.720
What you're really going to get, you get new bundle and accessory news that's being shared

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:42.720
in Germany.

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:49.020
So what I meant to say is, you know, instead of wood, it's actually wooden.

01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:54.300
There wouldn't be any news for for new all new hardware.

01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:56.200
Sorry for the confusion.

01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:58.000
He asked and they said it was OK.

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:08.000
Well, what happened is that we had to ask Sony if it was OK for us to unveil the new

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.680
hardware. And Sony said it was OK.

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:12.160
And Sony said it was OK.

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:14.400
So he said we would.

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:15.400
I mean, what?

01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:25.700
Here, I thought this was just going to be another slow episode of the show, and that's

01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:30.020
probably one of my favorite zingers that's come up in the past, like, year on this program.

01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:36.340
Anyway, new hardware and accessories.

01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:41.820
So, yeah, exciting, I guess that that does mean, you know, made it cheaper, you know,

01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:44.780
serious. I thought they were supposed to have like a redesigned controller or something

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.320
that was supposed to be coming out at some point, because I know that they were having

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:49.320
like a new controller of some sort.

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:54.760
I thought maybe maybe I'm mistaken, but I thought they had like a new accessory or

01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:56.080
controller or something that was coming out.

01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:00.160
So that's probably what you're going to see a games com, but not like how you are.

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.600
Maybe no HoloLens.

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:06.520
I would love for HoloLens to come down in price.

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:10.040
That's just it doesn't that doesn't seem like a games com type of thing.

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:14.560
Yeah, I think that's a, you know, CS, CS or a GD.

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:19.200
Like the next phase of what that looks like type of thing for developers.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.400
I don't know. That's too early.

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:26.920
Anyway, let's get to let's get to a more, you know, redesign, you know, VR controllers.

01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:29.480
Sony, can we please get something?

01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:31.840
All right, let's get to a simpler timing game.

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.320
Let's go back to a time when there wasn't VR.

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:37.360
You didn't have VR. Actually, no, we had VR back in this time.

01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:38.880
It was just it was lawnmower.

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:43.440
Yeah, lawnmower. The mind's eye, it was all the mind's eye.

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:45.540
All the VR like footage of the mind's eye.

01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:50.380
Yeah, it's it's the classic game of the week.

01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:53.760
Dark Sakura goes to the gaming ball, blah, blah, blah.

01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:55.220
Play this game, blah, blah, blah.

01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:55.660
What is it?

01:26:55.660 --> 01:27:00.620
Hey, I have this game, Blazing Lasers, also known as Gunhead in Japan,

01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:05.460
which is a space shooter done by Hudson Soft and Compile.

01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:08.980
So, you know, it's kind of sometimes a pain in the ass.

01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:16.520
But it came out in Japan and North America in 1989 for the NEC PC Engine,

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.760
also known as the TurboGrafx-16 over here.

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:22.040
It's based off of the Japanese film called Gunhead,

01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:25.400
although they removed references to the movie in North America.

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:29.400
Now that I know this, I might actually have to watch this movie,

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:31.080
so I'm going to go look for it.

01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:37.040
Anyway, in the game, the galaxy is under attack by an any space

01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:42.260
called the Dark Squadron, and so the only thing that can help them

01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:47.100
is the Gunhead Advanced Starfighter, which would be pronounced GASK.

01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:54.460
Anyway, so it is a vertical scrolling shooter and you go and you blow shit up.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.060
It was actually developed by the same people who did Puyo Puyo

01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:03.700
and Super Bomberman, as well as Xanax, The Guardian Legend,

01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:09.640
and Doremi Fantasy, which that was Mylon's Doki Doki Adventures.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:17.280
And it has since been released on the Wii Virtual Console in North America,

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:20.480
Europe and Australia in 2007 and in Japan the following year,

01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:25.880
and on the PlayStation Network in 2010 and on the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2014.

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:32.040
So basically, you know, this is I'd probably say, you know, keep in mind

01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:36.560
the PC Engine got a shit ton of shooters.

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:39.600
I mean, an inordinate amount of shooters.

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:41.280
Some of them were garbage.

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:43.180
Some of them were amazing.

01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:48.680
And I'm actually pretty happy that Blazing Lasers came out over here

01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:51.120
because it was a ridiculously good game

01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:55.560
when we kind of got some garbage on Turbo Grappler.

01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:01.800
In this game, you have a rapid fire cannon that you can upgrade

01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:06.320
or you can change other weapons into power ups and these orbs called gel capsules.

01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:11.560
You can also get multi bodies that shadow your action.

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:15.240
They have homing missiles, shields, different firing capability

01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:19.740
called full fire, and you get cluster bombs, all kinds of just fun weapons.

01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:22.580
But of course, my favorite is the big laser cannon

01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:24.940
that makes me think of Raiden.

01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:28.520
You remember Raiden, of course, Raiden is one of those games.

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:31.780
Um, is that what the wavy gravy or whatever?

01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:37.420
Well, the one in Raiden just latches on and swirls around until it gets them.

01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:40.660
But this one will actually, I think, shoot up and home in on them.

01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:43.520
Like in like 90 degree angles.

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:45.160
It's just a really, really cool weapon.

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:49.200
But yeah, other things that they did together.

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:51.540
I mean, basically the people who are behind this.

01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:56.340
It was directed by Nittani Masamitsu, who is also called Roo.

01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:59.160
Um, but he was the creator of Zanac.

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:04.640
He's the creator of the Guardian Legend, you know, and the PLPL series.

01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:09.100
We just had such an amazing cast on this.

01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:12.240
That's probably why this is still one of my favorite shooters, because

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:17.780
it had so many of those things in common with the Guardian Legend.

01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:20.320
It was as far as power ups and the way that it moved.

01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:22.520
But it was really, really solid.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:28.940
Um, it was really listed as one of the best,

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:30.820
I would say, 8-bit shooters.

01:30:30.820 --> 01:30:33.680
Just keep in mind, the turbo graphics is not a 16-bit system.

01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:36.220
It is still, it's still an 8-bit

01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:41.260
processor with a 16-bit graphic processor.

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:46.560
Yeah, it's like a weird hybrid.

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:49.300
And on top of that, Blazing Lasers was

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:55.120
probably the big thing that people were getting when they were playing our title.

01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:58.920
So I would say, you know, if no one here has played it

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:03.160
or they've seen like the kind of crappy artwork that came on the turbo chip,

01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:06.300
you know, in the U.S., don't let that fool you.

01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:09.700
It's kind of like how I look at Master System game art, you know,

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:12.400
where it's kind of generic looking.

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:15.380
Um, this is an excellent game.

01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:17.540
If you haven't played it, why the fuck not?

01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:21.100
And that's it, Blazing Lasers, a.k.a.

01:31:21.100 --> 01:31:23.560
Gunhead. Now I'm going to find the movie.

01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:25.760
All right. There it is.

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:27.860
Classic game of the week, Blazing Lasers.

01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:29.600
Dude, this poster looks awesome.

01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:34.140
All right. OK, I need

01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:36.080
I think they have a ship in it called the Marianne.

01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:38.640
I think I actually did play this game once. It's pretty rad.

01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:39.940
I like that game.

01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:41.540
So, all right.

01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:44.340
We're going to take a break, but there is more Orange Laundry to come.

01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:46.680
We have rapid fire news when we get back.

01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:48.360
Travel around the world and look at some release dates.

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:50.900
We're going to talk a little bit about accessibility in games.

01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:54.140
Some efforts to help developers make more aware about that.

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:56.900
And we'll talk a little bit about Mega Man and some of the Mega Man news

01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:59.600
at a Comic-Con that I'm sure Loki is thrilled about.

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:02.640
We'll get to that when we come back with more of Orange Laundry.

01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:04.540
Holy shit. The U.S.

01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:06.740
DVD of this is seventy seven dollars.

01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:08.720
How dare you interrupt my outro?

01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:11.240
All right. As I was saying,

01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:14.580
we'll be right back with more about Orange Laundry right after this.

01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:24.320
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight.

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:30.300
Episode number 738 of our show for this July 22nd of 2018.

01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:35.340
Already in progress with myself, Dark Soccer and Loki all here in studio

01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:38.300
as we will plan to be over the next few weeks.

01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:41.920
No shows, although unexpected things happen, such as happened last week.

01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:44.580
But for the most part, should be here for the next few weeks.

01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:47.120
The next show we're going to have off, though, is Labor Day weekend,

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:49.260
as has become typical over the past few years.

01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:51.820
I don't think we've done a show on Labor Day weekend in probably

01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:54.660
about six or seven years because I've been going to Dragon Con every year

01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:56.600
since since VOG was a thing.

01:32:56.600 --> 01:33:00.060
So, yeah, I'm really looking forward to this year's Dragon Con.

01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:02.660
I can't say anything officially about the schedule yet

01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:04.340
because it's not set in stone yet.

01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:09.340
But stay tuned to my Twitter and VOG network for not just my schedule,

01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:12.040
but we have a lot of representation from the different VOG shows

01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:15.300
that'll be there at the Dragon Con this year.

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.140
I know, of course, Bobby should be doing some stuff as well.

01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:22.840
But some of our other shows, I know, I don't know who all is confirmed

01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:26.680
going this year, but I know usually like John from Critical Myth

01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:29.020
and Gary from Critical Myth will probably be there.

01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:32.500
Brian from British Invaders should be back this year.

01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:34.720
So, you know, hopefully we'll have some representation

01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:37.400
across some of the other TV and other media panels as well.

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:39.700
So looking forward to it.

01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:42.460
In the meantime, let's move on with some more gaming news

01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:45.000
and some rapid fire news going to Loki.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.440
Yep. So we can talk a little bit about, you know, free updates.

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:51.900
As we were mentioning, Nomad Sky getting a pretty decent free update soon.

01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:56.780
The Nintendo Switch is getting an update to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

01:33:57.180 --> 01:34:01.680
So with that, you're going to be getting a Breath of the Wild

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:05.460
Breath of the Wild skinned version of the Master Cycle,

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.720
which is going to be something that's free as well.

01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:14.660
You can also get the tunic from Breath of the Wild as well.

01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:17.880
So that'll be updated for Link.

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:22.700
They said also there is going to have some ancient customization parts

01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:26.460
will be added to the other games, cars and paragliders.

01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:29.300
So you can change it up a bit.

01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:32.360
Not bad for free.

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.440
JD and chat confirmed me that's already live.

01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:35.540
Yeah, in the game. Yeah.

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:36.660
So I'm curious.

01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:40.260
So like, why release it now?

01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:41.260
I mean, that's that's neat.

01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:43.940
I wonder if they have any other announcements that they're going.

01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:46.800
Or is there still more DLC coming out for Breath of the Wild?

01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:52.340
I think is there are the two big ones already happened.

01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:55.020
But who knows? They might do more.

01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:58.680
I still have to purchase it again because I remember I sold it when I got

01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:01.520
my got rid of the Wii U.

01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:04.720
So I saw they get I never played through it, honestly.

01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:07.780
I mean, I was going to pick it up when it gets cheap.

01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:10.440
Mm hmm. So I just that's a big time sink.

01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:13.280
And I got to play Skyrim a couple more times, I'm sure.

01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:16.880
Of course, Skyrim and 4K. It's 4K now.

01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:19.960
Why not? I'm in VR.

01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:22.520
And then something else coming to the switch, actually.

01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:25.060
So you may remember South Park.

01:35:25.060 --> 01:35:28.260
The Fractured But Whole did come to the Nintendo Switch.

01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:31.500
What's also going to be coming, though, is the Stick of Truth.

01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:33.500
That is also going to be coming to the switch.

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:38.120
And then along with that, on all platforms, though, is the brand new DLC

01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:42.900
for South Park Fractured But Whole, the Bring the Crunch,

01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:46.960
which is a new, I guess, campaign

01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:51.300
which introduces a new class to its battle system

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.980
and has, I guess, some aliens.

01:35:55.480 --> 01:36:00.180
The mint berry crunch, which is an alien from Coco John.

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:05.200
I don't know, but it does take place in the

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:09.540
was it late Lake Tardicaca.

01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:13.900
Wow. So that's going to be kind of on

01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:18.380
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch and PC, July 31st.

01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:20.320
It'll cost eleven ninety nine.

01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:22.780
I can't remember this as part of the season pass.

01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:23.720
I have the season pass.

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:26.480
I think if I remember correctly, I bought it with the season pass.

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:28.760
So I need to go back and play that because it was a great game.

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.080
All right.

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:36.080
Going to a couple more stories for you guys, starting with the Stardew Valleys multiplayer.

01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:40.140
That is going live on the PC version of the game, August 1st.

01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:42.980
Console multiplayer to follow after that.

01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:47.480
There is a new trailer that you can watch that details all of this that came out on the Internet

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:52.080
that also shows the new farms that look really, really good.

01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:58.160
So you can check that out over on YouTube or pretty much any gaming blog that probably ran the multiplayer update.

01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:01.040
It's a good, relaxing, like

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:03.740
Animal Crossing style game, if you like that type of thing.

01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:08.920
Yeah, I got to admit, I I I couldn't really get totally sucked into Stardew Valley

01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:11.580
because it didn't really like it didn't guide me enough.

01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:14.980
And I didn't like I couldn't really figure out like what I was really supposed to be doing.

01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:16.820
And so it felt I don't know.

01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:20.260
It's not really anything you're supposed to be a little too open ended to me.

01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:22.660
If that's I need my games to have a little more structure.

01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:25.020
Well, they have like the whole system where you can,

01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:29.460
you know, unlock stuff in the community center.

01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:34.700
So that kind of gets you going in different directions to try to like, you know, grow different things or whatever.

01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:40.400
And then there's a relationship you can try to, you know, romance people in there.

01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:43.080
Maybe if somebody really wants to play the multiplayer,

01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:45.240
maybe I'll check it out again and get sucked in.

01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:48.440
Or the dude that wants you to go on the boat because of the implication, you know.

01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:53.480
Yeah, who knows? Anyway, I also news about Soulcalibur 6,

01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:56.480
which I'm looking forward to coming out later this year.

01:37:57.180 --> 01:38:01.860
It was confirmed that we will be getting Voldo as another character in that game.

01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:06.460
So a lot of great characters from the past coming back for Soulcalibur 6,

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:10.060
who, of course, is the hell guardian of the game.

01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:12.200
He's the one that has the creepy face mask.

01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:14.200
I would like spikes on his eyes and stuff.

01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:17.980
He looks kind of like weird, but he's back in Soulcalibur 6

01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:22.640
for those that really enjoy his little like bendy fighting mechanics.

01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:28.640
October 19th, again, is the day to look forward to this on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:31.640
Then did you see the the Arby's?

01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:36.920
I think it was cardboard like cosplay thing that they did for Soulcalibur.

01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:39.660
It was pretty, pretty epic.

01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:42.420
They they do a lot of that stuff, so I'm not too surprised.

01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:45.600
So, all right, Darsaco, what do you have for us?

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:47.960
Oh, just stuff.

01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:53.720
We are getting a Sega Ages Sonic the Hedgehog Thunder Force 4 included

01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:58.660
a fantasy star and some more games.

01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:01.760
It looks like it's going to be coming out on.

01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:05.740
Hold on. Does it say it's on the switch?

01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:06.740
Yeah, it's coming out on the switch.

01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:09.700
Well, there was also a mention of oh, yeah,

01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:13.880
Sonic will have different elements from the 3DS version, like the added spin dash

01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:17.900
and the mega play arcade version.

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:21.980
Thunder Force 4 will include Styx mode from the Sega Saturn version,

01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:23.720
and it will have leaderboards.

01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:27.080
Other ones are coming like Alex Kidd in Miracle World, Gain Ground,

01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:30.420
and like I said earlier, Fantasy Star.

01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:33.860
Also, well, you know,

01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:40.900
Team Instinct has been kind of the the whippin' boy of Pokemon Go because mad.

01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:43.860
I don't know if anyone else saw that comic.

01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:49.520
But Team Instinct has fully redeemed themselves at this year's Pokemon Go Fest.

01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:53.020
Team Mystic, what did I say?

01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:57.160
Yeah, Team Mystic was fairly looking smug,

01:39:57.500 --> 01:40:01.940
according to what I remember reading on this,

01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:03.960
except it turned out that

01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:07.500
Team Instinct were

01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:13.580
the highest number of research tasks completed nine million.

01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:16.420
They've blown the other two teams out of the water.

01:40:16.420 --> 01:40:18.780
So good job, yellow team.

01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:23.120
So honestly, especially after now having reached max level in Ingress,

01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:25.820
let me tell you, the teams in Pokemon Go, they don't matter.

01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:28.820
It's mad. They don't. It's mad.

01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:32.800
Yeah, there's still no game yet.

01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:34.560
Well, I mean, there's no competitive game.

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:36.700
It's not. Yeah, it's not a competitive game. Exactly.

01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:38.840
So, all right.

01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:41.040
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:43.720
and some games that will be coming out soon in a store near you,

01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:45.500
starting with the U.S., Loki.

01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:47.040
Well, we have a few things coming out this week.

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:50.600
So Mega Man X Legacy Collection is going to be coming out on PC,

01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:52.640
the Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:40:53.700 --> 01:40:55.780
Of course, you know, with No Man's Sky next,

01:40:55.780 --> 01:40:58.780
the Xbox One version of No Man's Sky is going to be coming out

01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:05.660
with the Banner Saga 3 on PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:10.860
And then looks like Ys Memories of Celcita.

01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:13.100
And that's on PC.

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:17.600
And Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation 2 on PlayStation 4.

01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:22.080
And let's see, last but not least, we've got

01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:25.240
Go Vacation on Nintendo Switch.

01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:29.120
And in a game I'm sure my kids will want to play for some stupid reason

01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:30.340
because they see it on YouTube.

01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:34.260
But Hello Neighbor is going to be coming out on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,

01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:36.520
iOS and Android.

01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:39.320
And it's a stealth survivor horror game

01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:41.240
about breaking into someone's house and trying to steal stuff

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:42.740
while he tries to kill you. I don't know.

01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:44.880
I know I've watched videos of it.

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:45.740
That's it.

01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:50.180
All right, let's travel to Japan, where on the 26th of July,

01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:53.360
we have Mysetsu Pier Station comes out.

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:57.800
There's a regular version of this and one that comes with a figure as well.

01:41:57.800 --> 01:41:59.120
So that's kind of interesting.

01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:01.320
I don't know if you get to, like, you know,

01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:04.600
have sex with the figure or something, but I don't think it's that kind of game.

01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:07.840
What? That's a jump to conclusions there.

01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:12.080
Well, it just it just looks like another one of those.

01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:16.240
Anyway, this oh, God, this game based on the cover art for this game.

01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:19.680
This is more of the game that I think people are going to want to fornicate

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:22.180
with fake versions of the characters.

01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:25.480
Senran Kagura, Peach Beach Splash.

01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:28.620
Oh, right. It's Senran Kagura. I mean, of course, that's right.

01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:32.460
The naughty ninja girls of Senran Kagura are going to be taking it.

01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:36.360
This is basically dead or alive beach volleyball, but it's squirt guns.

01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:38.300
Yeah, it's squirt guns and bikinis.

01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:40.500
That's right. White bikinis.

01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:42.700
So you know where this is going.

01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:46.620
Anyway, the Rockman X anniversary collection one and two.

01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:48.020
Obviously, that's what they call Mega Man over there.

01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:50.500
That is also out on July 26th.

01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:55.100
And you can get a game called My Kai Senke Disgaea Refine.

01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:59.220
I don't think that is the same Disgaea game.

01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:01.060
Oh, no, it is. It is the Disgaea series.

01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:03.460
So it's like probably some type of like definitive version.

01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:05.260
That's pretty cool.

01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:11.420
And then a Dragon Quest X all in one package, versions one through four,

01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:14.260
also releasing in Japan this week,

01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:19.220
along with a game called Spin Tires Mud Runner is out in Japan this week.

01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:21.220
So it's a pretty busy week in Japan.

01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:24.220
A lot of games going into the PlayStation hits collection over there as well,

01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:28.300
including Bloodborne, Little Big Planet 3 and Ratchet and Clank the Game,

01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:30.340
as well as Last of Us Remastered.

01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:33.780
All of those come out on the 26th as well.

01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:35.620
And if that isn't enough,

01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:39.540
why not get the PlayStation 4 Monster Hunter World Value Pack?

01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:45.300
That is some type of, I think, system plus game type of bundle.

01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:49.540
That is pretty much it for the Sony stuff.

01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:51.820
Looking quickly to see if Nintendo has anything.

01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:54.820
Yeah, Nintendo has the Rock Band collection as well.

01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:59.700
That My Kai Senke Disgaea, the Disgaea remaster is over there as well.

01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:03.140
Wolfenstein II The New Colossus gets its Japanese remake.

01:44:03.380 --> 01:44:05.860
Dragon Quest 10 is out on the Switch in Japan,

01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:08.300
so it's going to get that all in one package as well.

01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:14.820
And Daito Shouken no Hitsu Jikai Library Party.

01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:17.620
So ain't no party like a library party.

01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:20.980
Because the library party don't start until everyone shuts the fuck up.

01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:29.260
All right. Stacks books moving on to the UK, Dark Sakura.

01:44:29.420 --> 01:44:34.140
We have on the 24th Train Sim World for PlayStation and Xbox.

01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:38.220
We have on PlayStation the Persistence VR on the 25th.

01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:41.900
No Man's Sky on the 27th.

01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:45.940
Other things on the 27th is Hello Neighbor for Switch and PlayStation.

01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:49.340
Go Vacation on Switch.

01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:52.980
The Banner Saga Trilogy Bonus Edition,

01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:56.020
also on the 27th for PlayStation and Xbox.

01:44:56.020 --> 01:44:58.380
That's it.

01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:01.980
All right. Better than a shart.

01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:04.740
This is the part of the show where we would get to the mailbag.

01:45:06.340 --> 01:45:07.540
If we had any emails.

01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:11.420
We need a sad version of that song, like in a minor key, minor key.

01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:15.340
Yeah. Well, you should just start playing like the funeral dirge.

01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:20.820
So anyway, my point is to send us emails.

01:45:20.980 --> 01:45:23.780
That was that was two weeks and no emails.

01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:25.420
I'm depressed now.

01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:29.580
We got some people asking us to vote in a gubernatorial

01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:32.180
thing in a state we don't have in that.

01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:34.780
Jeez. We haven't gotten any Russian porn spam, though.

01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:36.700
Well, that's a plus, I guess.

01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:38.740
That was something we used to get on the old email address, right?

01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:43.260
That's a relief. Anyway, if you want to send us an email, please no spam.

01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:45.900
Participate at OrangeLoundTrader.com

01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:49.860
unless your spam comes with like Bitcoin or

01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:51.940
although I wouldn't know what to do with Bitcoin.

01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:57.700
I or, you know, a freak steam codes will take those two.

01:45:57.860 --> 01:46:01.940
Where was I where they said that we take cryptocurrency?

01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:03.580
I was in San Francisco.

01:46:03.580 --> 01:46:06.060
It was somewhere like walking toward Saks.

01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:09.460
And in the window it says we take cryptocurrency.

01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:11.020
I'm like, you do.

01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:14.260
There's a lot of random places, especially in the Bay Area, that will take

01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:18.420
cryptocurrency as, you know, payment for whatever is the Dyson vacuum place.

01:46:18.420 --> 01:46:19.460
No, it wasn't the Dyson.

01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:23.620
But there's a cryptocurrency ATM outside of

01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:26.700
the arcade that's in the Roswell Galleria.

01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:28.660
Yes, I've seen that.

01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:31.500
The I'm just like, why does this even exist?

01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:34.300
Yeah, I don't I don't even understand how it works.

01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:36.140
This is this is where I start to go.

01:46:36.140 --> 01:46:37.620
I'm old. I'm 40.

01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:41.580
Herp derp, because I don't I don't keep your dollars in a mattress.

01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:43.780
I would like one cryptocurrency, please.

01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:46.340
Yes, I would like one cryptocurrency.

01:46:46.340 --> 01:46:51.340
And I want to make a cryptocurrency called cryptocurrency.

01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:52.940
Can we do that? I mean, come on.

01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:54.460
Everything's like something coin.

01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:56.980
Let's just do I want cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency.

01:46:57.660 --> 01:47:02.540
I would I would be so down with making VOG coin or if if Bobby Black Wolf

01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:03.620
frowns on that, then fine.

01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:05.620
Oh, our coin. He can't stop us from doing that.

01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:10.460
But I'm all for like a currency that we own.

01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:13.540
But the question would be, what are you going to buy with it?

01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:16.020
Because that's how you're going to really give it value is

01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:22.940
make it worth something that like you can trade in one VOG coin for like X.

01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:25.700
You know what I mean? Like me screaming at you.

01:47:26.380 --> 01:47:28.580
I mean, one VOG coin for me to scream at you.

01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:29.780
That's terrible. I hate that.

01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:32.540
I'm surprised no one's made cryptocurrency for Shrewt books yet.

01:47:33.020 --> 01:47:37.140
Technically, we kind of it's not like an actual cryptocurrency,

01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:40.740
but technically we have like whose line is it anyway?

01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:42.580
We have the points and the points don't matter.

01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:44.140
But you should still play the game anyway.

01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:47.500
That's all built into the website, which is why you get that passphrase

01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:48.620
that shows up during the show.

01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:52.340
If you're listening on the podcast or if you're listening live, remember, plug,

01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:56.260
plug, you just go to live.vognetwork.com and you can click the thing and you can,

01:47:56.260 --> 01:47:57.140
you know, get points.

01:47:57.340 --> 01:48:00.620
And once in a while, the site gives you loot when you do certain things.

01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:02.060
It's like you build up your little profile.

01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:04.940
It's collect them all because why?

01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:07.740
Why do you why do you collect them and Pokemon go? Why not?

01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:09.300
So we do have that.

01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:10.740
We may not have our own cryptocurrency,

01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:13.780
but we have our own points and the points don't matter system.

01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:16.940
So anyway, let's see.

01:48:16.940 --> 01:48:19.740
I'm looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:23.980
Let's see. Tiger class says, use VOG coins to buy games.

01:48:23.980 --> 01:48:25.220
That would be one use for it.

01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:28.300
OK, Loki's game will only be purchasable with VOG coins.

01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:31.460
Well, I can't wait to make zero money on that.

01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:34.860
Oh, God. All right.

01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:40.420
Anyway, let's move on to some more video game news stories.

01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:42.540
Loki. All right.

01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:44.740
Well, this is kind of cool.

01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:51.060
So apparently there is this a game dev, I guess, a game maker's toolkit.

01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:55.540
It's basically a games writer by the name of Mark Brown.

01:48:55.740 --> 01:49:01.340
And he takes deep dives on certain aspects of gaming from level design to music.

01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:04.820
So he started a new series now called Making Games Better.

01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:10.020
And so with that, it's his first episode is basically making

01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:12.540
games better for the deaf and hard of hearing.

01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:14.580
So designing for disability.

01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:19.700
So that's pretty awesome that he's got this challenge kind of gives tips

01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:24.700
for game developers and how they can do different things for their games

01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:30.300
to be able to benefit, you know, these other demographics.

01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:34.500
So, for example, with the designing for disability for deaf and hard of hearing,

01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:37.980
he says, the thing is about video game subtitles, it's more important

01:49:37.980 --> 01:49:41.940
than any other medium that they're easy to read because you're trying to divide

01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:45.500
the your attention between subtitles and everything else you need to think about.

01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:49.940
So, you know, they have he's got a whole bunch of tips.

01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:52.940
He's going to be doing this series, I guess, for other aspects as well.

01:49:53.340 --> 01:49:55.900
And if you want to check it out, you can.

01:49:56.220 --> 01:49:59.980
And then also he has a picture on, too, if you need to want to support that.

01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:05.860
But it's pretty neat to give it a look and see what they recommend.

01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:11.420
But it's neat to see that there's resources out there to talk about accessibility,

01:50:11.420 --> 01:50:21.060
because it's not really something that's brought up a lot in the game dev video tutorial series world.

01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:23.940
Yeah, I think that's really cool just to like, you know, a lot of times,

01:50:23.940 --> 01:50:26.140
99 percent of it is just like awareness.

01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:30.740
I made that statistic up, but it's just awareness, you know, like, oh,

01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:35.420
I could do this thing really easily, but if I didn't think to do it, I might not do it.

01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:41.740
You know, and you can't like you have to put every little thing in a game that you make.

01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:44.340
You know what I mean? Like what I mean by that is that like,

01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:49.180
OK, take my reading of the game Tempest 4000 earlier in the show is that like

01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:53.660
they don't have options in it to like change the resolution or use the mouse

01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:57.900
or remap the buttons because they just didn't put it in there.

01:50:57.900 --> 01:50:58.780
You know what I mean?

01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:02.380
So it's like things like that developers kind of like have to put in their games.

01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:06.420
And even though it might not necessarily be difficult, I don't know.

01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:08.780
I don't I don't make a lot of games, but, you know,

01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:13.260
it's just it's standard practice on PC to do that kind of stuff,

01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:14.780
even if you don't do it for console.

01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:19.420
But come on, you got to you got to realize that you're putting this on PC.

01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:20.580
You can't just like, yeah,

01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:23.620
let's copy and paste what I did in this other platform, put it out here. It's fine.

01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:26.060
I know. But anyway, back to the topic at hand with the accessibility for like

01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:28.020
for the deaf and so forth.

01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:32.340
Like, I think it's really cool that, you know, to to just build that awareness.

01:51:32.380 --> 01:51:35.980
And, you know, things to do and, you know, what maybe not to do,

01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:39.380
what what color patterns might not be as good to use as certain other color

01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:42.940
patterns to help people with certain color blindness and, you know, things like that.

01:51:42.940 --> 01:51:46.220
So pretty cool. All right.

01:51:47.180 --> 01:51:52.780
Let's move on and talk about a unveiling at Comic-Con this past weekend,

01:51:52.780 --> 01:51:56.340
which is for Mega Man Fully Charged. That's right.

01:51:56.340 --> 01:51:59.100
The full trailer for Mega Man Fully Charged came out.

01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:01.860
And now you can check out what's going to be coming to the cartoon.

01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:06.660
I watched so I watched the trailer and I watched also the episode one trailer.

01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:10.340
The trailer that they have for the whole series looks like hot shit.

01:52:10.460 --> 01:52:11.100
Here it is right now.

01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:13.860
We're going to play it here in studio a little bit, just so,

01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:17.100
because I want to see Jamie's take on this, too.

01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:23.740
I don't someone to hate the look

01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:26.300
completely because it kind of reminds me of Tron,

01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:28.340
even though it does look a little cheap.

01:52:28.340 --> 01:52:30.940
It looks very cheap.

01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:33.620
It does look like it was made on the cheap.

01:52:33.620 --> 01:52:36.540
I don't know, I think I've watched it.

01:52:36.540 --> 01:52:38.660
I try it. I try it.

01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:40.980
And make a perfect decision from there, Jim.

01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:47.820
So we'll see. Anyway, I can barely hear anything, but I wonder if it's kind of based off the Mega Man EXE or

01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:50.460
Rockman Battle No. No, it's it's garbage.

01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:52.780
He's got he's got Micro Man.

01:52:52.780 --> 01:52:57.340
He's just like this little robot that lives in this helmet that like quips stupid shit.

01:52:57.820 --> 01:52:59.420
Well, if you want to see for yourself,

01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:02.900
you can check out a preview on the Cartoon Network app on August 3rd,

01:53:03.100 --> 01:53:06.540
and then it airs on the actual Cartoon Network on August 5th.

01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:09.860
They had a preview, though, for like the first episode.

01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:14.580
They had like a trailer and it and show a little bit more in detail what it was like.

01:53:14.580 --> 01:53:19.860
And it's not as bad as that trailer, but it still looks bad.

01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:25.140
I mean, it's just it's the lowest like I don't know, like I get it.

01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:27.100
It's not supposed to appeal to me.

01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:28.540
It's supposed to appeal to kids.

01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:29.420
Kids might be into it?

01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:31.820
I don't know.

01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:34.300
I mean, they're into a lot of things like all of a sudden.

01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:40.940
But like with that in mind, OK, like, for example, they just put out a Captain Underpants cartoon

01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:42.380
because the movie was kind of funny.

01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:44.660
My kids read the books and I watched the cartoon.

01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:45.900
Well, I thought your kids could read.

01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:48.180
My older kid can.

01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:49.780
My youngest cannot.

01:53:49.780 --> 01:53:51.900
OK, my oldest, he can read just fine.

01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:55.940
OK, no, but like Captain and I read it to them as well.

01:53:55.940 --> 01:54:04.380
So so we watched the cartoon in the cartoon is for it's structured like the book.

01:54:04.380 --> 01:54:06.020
And they have like chapters of seven.

01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:09.700
It's really well animated and it's funny, has good writing.

01:54:11.260 --> 01:54:12.940
You know that they're into.

01:54:13.900 --> 01:54:15.700
But this is like kind of dumb.

01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:18.420
This reminds me of like the Pac-Man cartoon that they had.

01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:19.660
And it's just as cheap.

01:54:19.660 --> 01:54:25.380
Look, the animation looks just as cheap or maybe even like if I'm trying to think.

01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:28.660
What's something else that they like?

01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:29.380
They like.

01:54:31.740 --> 01:54:32.540
What's it called? It's.

01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:38.380
There's another show that is Disney.

01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:40.340
I think it's Disney.

01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:44.020
It's they have like three ninjas or whatever.

01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:45.180
Oh, whatever doesn't matter.

01:54:47.260 --> 01:54:48.980
But there's there's other cheaper cartoons.

01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:53.540
It's just I don't think when you see the animation, the animation is kind of cheap and

01:54:53.580 --> 01:54:56.740
usually when they skimp on the animation like that, they're also skimping on the

01:54:56.740 --> 01:55:01.740
writing and it's just like it gets tiring after a while and they get bored with it.

01:55:01.740 --> 01:55:06.340
So unless there's something to really hook them in and make it interesting, I think

01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:10.260
that it's just going to be kind of it's going to be there and then it's just they're

01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:11.100
going to stop making it.

01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:14.540
Whatever, I mean, I'm not going to watch it.

01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:16.540
It looks dumb. I tried watching.

01:55:16.540 --> 01:55:21.340
I do like that they do some like flashback stuff when they're talking about different

01:55:21.340 --> 01:55:26.420
things. It's like in a retro pixelated like sprite.

01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:30.140
They tell it like sprites and they have like sprite little cut, you know, animations

01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:32.020
between scenes and stuff like that.

01:55:32.140 --> 01:55:33.260
So that's neat.

01:55:34.020 --> 01:55:35.980
But once again, who's that appealing to?

01:55:35.980 --> 01:55:39.460
Is that supposed to appeal to me, the person that played the video games, or is it

01:55:39.460 --> 01:55:40.540
supposed to appeal to a kid?

01:55:40.540 --> 01:55:41.900
Kid doesn't give a shit about that.

01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:48.340
I don't know. It's just I wish it was written in a way where like it appeals to all

01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:50.020
audiences because you don't have to.

01:55:50.020 --> 01:55:51.700
Why are you dumbing it down?

01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:53.780
You don't have to dumb that shit down for kids.

01:55:54.140 --> 01:55:56.620
We used to watch the fucking Batman anime series.

01:55:56.620 --> 01:55:58.860
That wasn't fucking dumbed down for kids.

01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:03.700
You know, there are Darkwing Dockery, these like DuckTales and shit like I watched.

01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:07.900
Like my my my favorite shit was the stuff that was like Tiny Toons and Animaniacs.

01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:09.540
Exactly. True levels of humor.

01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:10.900
Exactly. Exactly.

01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:14.060
That was great. But old school Rocky and Bull angle.

01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:19.340
But nowadays, like even like Mickey Mouse, like my son watches my youngest and watches

01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:23.620
Mickey Mouse stuff on his tablet, that shit's like fucking SpongeBob.

01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:26.900
It's like I mean, not to say that SpongeBob is bad, because that's just that peels the

01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:29.220
stoner people and everybody.

01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:30.780
I mean, everybody loves SpongeBob, but it's stupid.

01:56:30.940 --> 01:56:33.220
But it's like not as much as adventure time.

01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:35.500
Oh, my God. Yes. Like I was so funny.

01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:37.500
You know, it's like it's like that.

01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:40.620
And that's fine. But it's not like it's not Mickey Mouse anymore.

01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:43.620
Nothing makes me want to smoke weed like episodes of Adventure Time.

01:56:44.300 --> 01:56:48.580
But yeah, but the new Mickey Mouse show is like fucking like Adventure Time or Ren

01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:52.100
Sippy or something like that. It's just it's just fucking crazy.

01:56:52.100 --> 01:56:55.740
If you watch that and I don't know, it just is weird.

01:56:56.420 --> 01:57:00.380
But I guess it's just the demographic nowadays is the kids like that kind of crap.

01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:03.900
I mean, it's fine. It's more interesting than the other Mickey Mouse cartoons.

01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:06.060
And the DuckTales and new DuckTales is fucking awesome.

01:57:06.620 --> 01:57:08.900
But I don't think this is going to be awesome.

01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:10.420
This is going to be awesome. Like Sonic.

01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:12.980
What's the Sonic show they have now?

01:57:13.220 --> 01:57:15.820
That's shit. Sonic hero, Sonic Boom.

01:57:15.820 --> 01:57:18.540
Yeah. No one gives a shit about Sonic Boom.

01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:22.180
No one's fucking like, oh, my God, I need to see the new episode of Sonic Boom.

01:57:22.180 --> 01:57:25.100
I got to get home so I can watch. I got to watch my Sonic Boom.

01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:26.900
No one fucking cares about that.

01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:29.580
Like, no one's going to fucking care about this show either.

01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:34.700
And that's what pisses me off. It's like more Capcom.

01:57:35.620 --> 01:57:38.820
When you're licensing Mega Man, make it more like Mega Man 11,

01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:42.780
not fucking bad box Mega Man that was in, you know,

01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:44.660
the fighting games.

01:57:44.660 --> 01:57:48.060
But I'm all about new She-Ra that dresses like a normal person.

01:57:48.380 --> 01:57:50.540
All about that. New She-Ra? Yeah.

01:57:50.740 --> 01:57:52.260
She wears real fucking armor.

01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:54.940
Yeah. An actual breastplate, shorts under her skirt.

01:57:54.940 --> 01:57:59.540
Instead of like a titty plate, she dresses like somebody might actually wear something.

01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:04.020
So real armor about fucking time.

01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:06.020
OK, moving on.

01:58:06.740 --> 01:58:08.380
Let's go to a different type of gaming story.

01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:09.380
Darcy.

01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:15.100
Well, I'm sure we've seen an increase of diagnoses with kids with

01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:20.860
attention problems and kids having trouble with their own anger management.

01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:25.860
There is a game now, this game came out in November last year,

01:58:26.340 --> 01:58:29.140
but it's getting a lot more attention.

01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:30.620
It's called Mightier.

01:58:31.100 --> 01:58:35.500
And for kids who have issues with anxiety or

01:58:36.220 --> 01:58:41.860
anger problems, what they do is they have the strap that goes on on their forearm

01:58:42.180 --> 01:58:45.580
that measures their heart rate and oxygen level.

01:58:46.060 --> 01:58:52.140
And so the game itself will change based on their heart rate and oxygen level,

01:58:52.140 --> 01:58:55.140
as in anxiety or stress response.

01:58:55.460 --> 01:58:59.900
So they actually get rewarded for forcing themselves to calm down,

01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:02.540
to breathe, to do soothing techniques.

01:59:03.060 --> 01:59:08.300
So basically, the game is to teach them how to self-regulate their own moods.

01:59:10.380 --> 01:59:15.420
And actually has been rather lauded by a good series of behavioral pediatricians.

01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:19.820
Although there are some people who have been pretty much against it,

01:59:19.820 --> 01:59:24.780
because, you know, it's just more they think that more video games

01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:26.300
are going to lead to more attention problems.

01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:31.100
But a lot of kids have found the game because it teaches them this.

01:59:31.140 --> 01:59:33.300
They are now doing these things in real life,

01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:39.180
because now they know that it should be a situation that they should calm themselves in.

01:59:39.180 --> 01:59:43.260
So I think it's actually a pretty good idea that they're now bringing video games into

01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:44.340
modern psychology.

01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:45.660
I think it's really awesome.

01:59:49.140 --> 01:59:50.820
Yeah, that was my story.

01:59:51.940 --> 01:59:56.620
Cool. What do you think maybe we can take from this for,

01:59:56.980 --> 02:00:00.460
like, I guess, if you will, mainstream development of games?

02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:04.700
Well, I think that the same techniques could be applied toward adults, for one thing.

02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:09.980
I think that...

02:00:12.900 --> 02:00:13.900
Well, see, I don't know.

02:00:13.900 --> 02:00:16.340
It makes me think that if we had the Vitality sensor,

02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:19.820
if that had come out, Nintendo would have done more things like that, too.

02:00:19.820 --> 02:00:23.220
You know, it's kind of an old concept if you think about it.

02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:29.420
But I think that if it helps, I think kids with all of these issues

02:00:29.420 --> 02:00:31.740
become better members of society.

02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:37.300
Who knows? It could also inspire, you know, more games to help with, you know, social issues

02:00:37.300 --> 02:00:41.020
or, you know, or even going back to the accessibility issues, you know,

02:00:41.020 --> 02:00:45.540
thinking in terms of using these as tools and not just as entertainment.

02:00:45.900 --> 02:00:49.140
Helping these kids to be the future creators.

02:00:49.580 --> 02:00:50.220
Something like that.

02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:50.940
Yeah, I like that.

02:00:51.660 --> 02:00:56.020
In chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Captain Spike says, wow, this is an awesome idea.

02:00:56.580 --> 02:00:59.340
Dungeon Buster in chat says, there's an article I found on the net

02:00:59.340 --> 02:01:03.340
of an old, old game mag from the early 80s that interviewed a psychologist

02:01:03.340 --> 02:01:08.620
who used wizardry to help patients like children get out of their shells and socialize.

02:01:08.860 --> 02:01:14.140
Wizardry as in the Sir Tech game, not like, you know, like Harry Potter.

02:01:14.140 --> 02:01:15.060
You're a wizard, Harry.

02:01:15.060 --> 02:01:17.100
Not like that, like the actual game wizardry.

02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:19.220
If you remember that from back in the day, that's pretty cool.

02:01:19.980 --> 02:01:21.540
All right. Just a few more stories for you guys.

02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:24.180
Then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:01:24.180 --> 02:01:25.700
All one word on Skype.

02:01:25.700 --> 02:01:27.100
First, Loki.

02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:29.780
All right. So there's a new Famicom game coming out.

02:01:29.900 --> 02:01:31.860
It's not exactly new.

02:01:31.860 --> 02:01:34.220
It's not not new, new, as you will.

02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:39.220
But it's basically a Japanese port of the game Battle Kid.

02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:44.860
And for those not familiar with Battle Kid, Battle Kid is an insanely fucking hard game

02:01:45.220 --> 02:01:47.700
that looks very much like I want to be the guy.

02:01:47.940 --> 02:01:51.460
In fact, you know, the main character looks exactly like we want to be the guy.

02:01:51.660 --> 02:01:54.140
But it plays more like Mega Man.

02:01:54.700 --> 02:01:58.860
So, you know, they have released this.

02:01:58.860 --> 02:02:03.020
Originally, it was on an NES cartridge in 2010, and now it's actually making its way

02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:04.020
to the Famicom as well.

02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:07.060
So they've done a few things with the Japanese version.

02:02:07.060 --> 02:02:09.900
So the, of course, translation.

02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:15.940
They also switched to hit points instead of one hit deaths, which I find interesting

02:02:15.940 --> 02:02:17.740
because that's the whole point of the game.

02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:21.100
It's supposed to be fucking hard and one hit deaths, but whatever.

02:02:21.700 --> 02:02:28.140
They have a life counter, added some new checkpoints, added a new boss, new stage,

02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:34.060
new sound effects, 11 new music tracks, doubled the ROM size and changed the movement

02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:35.660
attack patterns of some of the enemies.

02:02:36.260 --> 02:02:37.420
So pretty cool.

02:02:37.980 --> 02:02:40.340
And that's going to be that actually came out.

02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:44.780
Yeah, it's supposed to be released in Japan September of this year.

02:02:44.980 --> 02:02:46.980
Nice. All right.

02:02:46.980 --> 02:02:49.660
Well, one more story for you guys out of Comic-Con and then we're going to get to our

02:02:49.660 --> 02:02:51.700
Skypline at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:56.900
But if you're a big fan of Overwatch and you're a big fan of Nerf, we're going to be

02:02:56.900 --> 02:03:03.260
very happy because they are releasing official Overwatch Nerf blasters.

02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:08.340
This particular first one that's coming out is modeled after Reaper's weapon in

02:03:08.340 --> 02:03:11.260
Overwatch. So it's these little like hand shotgun things.

02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:15.140
But yeah, now you can get a Nerf version of this.

02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:18.140
Nerf is partnering with Blizzard on the official Overwatch Nerf gun.

02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:21.900
The Nerf Rival Overwatch Reaper White Edition.

02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:24.100
It's due in 2019.

02:03:24.300 --> 02:03:26.180
It mimics the look of the shotgun.

02:03:26.380 --> 02:03:29.100
But obviously the functionality is a little bit different.

02:03:30.140 --> 02:03:34.500
You get eight little Nerf rounds for this and there's a ready indicator and a safety

02:03:34.500 --> 02:03:35.580
lock with this.

02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:40.980
So, Dartusy in chat says, I don't play Overwatch, but that is really cool in my

02:03:40.980 --> 02:03:45.660
opinion. Yeah, you don't have to play Overwatch to understand a Nerf gun.

02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:47.820
So it's pretty cool.

02:03:47.980 --> 02:03:50.780
So no pricing has been announced yet.

02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:54.700
I'm sure it's probably not going to be very cheap, but it probably won't be too crazy

02:03:54.700 --> 02:03:57.180
either. So who knows what will come after this?

02:03:57.180 --> 02:04:01.740
Will they do weapons based off, you know, Soldier 76's weapon or Tracer's guns or

02:04:01.740 --> 02:04:03.540
what? We'll see what happens.

02:04:03.780 --> 02:04:08.500
So anyway, we'll see what comes of this Hasbro partnership a little later on.

02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:14.140
All right. Anyhow, with that, we are going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge

02:04:14.140 --> 02:04:15.860
Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:19.020
If you want to give us a call to talk about anything that we've talked about tonight or

02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:22.820
maybe something that we missed, we're happy to take your call right now.

02:04:23.220 --> 02:04:27.300
While we wait to see if anybody calls in, Loki, any other stories that we didn't get to

02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:28.580
tonight? Some last minute stories?

02:04:31.420 --> 02:04:35.180
I feel like it was I mean, even though we had Comic-Con this weekend, which is a big

02:04:35.180 --> 02:04:40.980
deal, it's not obviously there is stuff during the week that like I saw and I'm like, I

02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:44.500
know I'm going to forget that come Sunday and I didn't write it down.

02:04:44.540 --> 02:04:47.860
And I know there's other things that happened that were like pretty significant.

02:04:47.900 --> 02:04:51.860
And I'm just like I even went back to them, like looking for that stuff.

02:04:51.860 --> 02:04:55.100
And I know one of them was that whole the AI thing, which we talked about.

02:04:55.900 --> 02:04:58.180
But there is another thing, too, and I can't remember.

02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:04.860
What it was. Oh, well, I guess it's not a huge thing that there was the two countries.

02:05:04.900 --> 02:05:09.900
I can't remember which countries that European countries now that had issue with the

02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:19.100
loot boxes in Counter-Strike go that they actually removed loot boxes out of those

02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:25.300
regions because of the whole laws regarding it, because they're going to face a bunch

02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:29.180
of fines in regards to the loot boxes being gambling.

02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:33.900
So I know that that was a thing, but that's kind of minor.

02:05:34.260 --> 02:05:37.700
But it is interesting to see that they're having to take action for that stuff already.

02:05:38.140 --> 02:05:42.580
Um, but yeah, a whole lot of news, a lot of Comic-Con stuff, lots of movies.

02:05:42.620 --> 02:05:44.780
Yeah, a lot of that's movie movie talk, though.

02:05:44.780 --> 02:05:48.980
Any well, let's let's allow ourselves to deviate a little bit here to some of the other

02:05:48.980 --> 02:05:51.100
nerd stuff. Any of the nerd stuff out of Comic-Con?

02:05:51.100 --> 02:05:55.500
Catch your eye. I'm surprised that the Aquaman trailer looked pretty good.

02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:59.580
I don't really like DC stuff too much anymore, but the Aquaman trailer looked awesome.

02:05:59.580 --> 02:06:01.740
And then, of course, Godzilla, King of the Monster.

02:06:02.460 --> 02:06:06.380
That's awesome. It looks so well with a kid from Stranger Things in it, huh?

02:06:06.380 --> 02:06:08.740
Yeah, but it just looks so good.

02:06:08.740 --> 02:06:11.620
And then Glass looks interesting.

02:06:11.660 --> 02:06:12.620
I want to see that.

02:06:14.900 --> 02:06:16.700
I can't think of what else I saw.

02:06:17.380 --> 02:06:21.220
I am excited, of course, to see the new Invader Zim movie whenever that comes out.

02:06:21.940 --> 02:06:24.380
It looks very much Invader Zim.

02:06:25.420 --> 02:06:31.580
Just sad that that's all there is, is just the movie, not rebooting a new show or anything.

02:06:31.580 --> 02:06:33.020
Yeah, but whatever.

02:06:33.020 --> 02:06:37.060
Um. Yeah, I don't know.

02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:38.740
I mean, that's pretty much it.

02:06:38.740 --> 02:06:41.380
Oh, yeah, they have the Voltron Lego set coming out.

02:06:41.420 --> 02:06:42.980
They were selling it at Comic-Con.

02:06:42.980 --> 02:06:45.140
Yeah, that's coming out on August 1st.

02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:48.340
I still need to put together my Tron light bike that I finally bought at the Lego store.

02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:49.140
Yeah, I really need to.

02:06:49.700 --> 02:06:51.180
Very, very, very quick build.

02:06:51.220 --> 02:06:52.340
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

02:06:52.340 --> 02:06:54.220
I'm sure. But cool.

02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:56.220
We still haven't put together our DeLorean.

02:06:57.140 --> 02:06:58.940
Oh, would you get like an official two of them?

02:06:58.980 --> 02:06:59.580
Oh, cool.

02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:02.500
Oh, God, that thing's like that's pretty old now.

02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:06.900
I know we have a couple of them just because Dan wanted one to build and one to keep in the box.

02:07:06.900 --> 02:07:08.780
So I like that.

02:07:10.420 --> 02:07:17.180
God, whenever I think of Lego, I think like Toys R Us and how, you know, they all went under because a lot of people were trying to get the deals and the Legos and stuff.

02:07:17.180 --> 02:07:23.020
But like, we haven't seen what's going to go in at any of those old retail places on like a lot of these stores.

02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:28.300
Halloween costume shop whenever, you know, spirit is where I buy all my house decorations.

02:07:29.220 --> 02:07:30.940
But it's like they're everywhere.

02:07:30.940 --> 02:07:34.100
And so it's like, oh, boy, last thing we need is another one of those.

02:07:34.100 --> 02:07:35.900
I don't know. But that's fine.

02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:37.820
Yeah, I don't know what they would put in there.

02:07:37.820 --> 02:07:40.220
I mean, I don't know.

02:07:40.220 --> 02:07:42.260
I'm waiting to hear about KB coming back.

02:07:42.740 --> 02:07:44.940
We need some Sears closed down.

02:07:45.100 --> 02:07:46.300
There are local Sears.

02:07:46.300 --> 02:07:47.820
Oh, the one at Sunrise.

02:07:47.820 --> 02:07:50.540
That's gone. Oh, that's completely gone.

02:07:50.540 --> 02:07:51.860
I mean, I get it.

02:07:51.860 --> 02:07:55.220
It's not like I'm crying, but like I'm like, what's left of that mall?

02:07:55.220 --> 02:07:56.740
It's pretty empty.

02:07:57.220 --> 02:07:58.860
They have a toy store.

02:07:58.860 --> 02:08:03.580
It's like a mostly a board game store, but they have toys there.

02:08:03.580 --> 02:08:05.260
It's just kind of lame.

02:08:05.380 --> 02:08:15.060
I think that you finally you find like stuff now at places like BoxLunch or the box lunch that we used to have up here close to the one in our fairs there.

02:08:15.420 --> 02:08:17.660
The one up in there was one in Pladio, I think.

02:08:17.700 --> 02:08:20.180
Oh, wow. The Arden Fair ones like nice and big.

02:08:20.260 --> 02:08:21.700
We got a call coming in. So let's get to it.

02:08:21.700 --> 02:08:23.100
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry. Who's this?

02:08:23.660 --> 02:08:24.820
What's going on? It's Rama.

02:08:25.020 --> 02:08:26.180
Hey, Rama, what's up, buddy?

02:08:27.180 --> 02:08:29.820
Do I sound a lot better than the last time I called in?

02:08:29.820 --> 02:08:30.860
You do sound a lot better.

02:08:30.860 --> 02:08:33.060
Your volume is stabilizing a little bit, but that's normal.

02:08:33.060 --> 02:08:33.780
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:36.700
Well, a couple of things I want to mention.

02:08:36.700 --> 02:08:39.620
And on a side note, I got on an Amazon deal thing.

02:08:39.620 --> 02:08:41.380
I got a brand new mic for like 60 bucks.

02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:42.340
I'm kind of happy about that.

02:08:42.340 --> 02:08:43.860
Shoot. There you go. Good news.

02:08:43.860 --> 02:08:46.180
Good news. What's up, my friend?

02:08:47.420 --> 02:08:53.300
We were talking earlier about antenna TV and VTV, and I'm kind of thankful because I can get them on my...

02:08:53.300 --> 02:08:57.460
Hey, buddy, you suddenly like your volume drops significantly.

02:08:57.460 --> 02:09:00.660
I don't know if you moved away from your mic or something, but like we can't hear your question.

02:09:01.540 --> 02:09:02.500
Can you hear me now?

02:09:02.500 --> 02:09:03.420
Yes, we can, sir.

02:09:03.900 --> 02:09:06.780
All right. This microphone is extra sensitive from what I can tell.

02:09:06.780 --> 02:09:07.380
Interesting.

02:09:08.540 --> 02:09:18.580
But what I was saying was antenna TV, VTV, it's not just available over the air, but depending on your local cable provider, you can catch them that way, too.

02:09:18.740 --> 02:09:19.900
Yes, some of them.

02:09:19.900 --> 02:09:23.700
Some of the channels are so cheap that cable doesn't even bother to pick them up.

02:09:23.980 --> 02:09:26.700
But you're right. Some of those channels are on your local cable.

02:09:26.700 --> 02:09:35.300
But, you know, with more and more people that are cord cutting these days, it is still pretty impressive what you can pick up with an antenna.

02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:47.140
If you're willing to watch old stuff, you know, some people aren't interested in watching, you know, old reruns of Mama's Family, which to those people, I say, boo, because, you know.

02:09:47.380 --> 02:10:01.140
But anyway, but, you know, there's a lot of stuff that you can pick up with an antenna these days, especially, but in a place like New York City or something, it's probably even doubly so than, you know, a more remote part of the country.

02:10:01.140 --> 02:10:06.780
I wouldn't call Sacramento remote, but, you know, we probably still don't have as many channels over the air as you guys have.

02:10:07.540 --> 02:10:14.580
Well, I mean, being here in New York City, I can pick up stations like in Southern Connecticut, per se.

02:10:14.580 --> 02:10:16.020
So that's not so bad.

02:10:16.020 --> 02:10:33.500
Right now, if you're in North Jersey, you're going to get the regular New York City stations down by where Makochon lives and where Ari lives, if they went to OTA antenna, actually more where Ari lives, he could pick up the local Philly affiliated stations.

02:10:33.540 --> 02:10:43.180
Oh, wow. I remember as a kid when we used to like, if you could aim the antenna like just the right way, you could get Fox out of the Bay Area.

02:10:44.180 --> 02:10:49.900
Yes. Yes. Yes. Because I remember for a short period of time, this defined all logic.

02:10:49.900 --> 02:11:01.940
I was able to pull a station in from like New Hampshire and I'm like, it's got to be bouncing off of a local affiliate or something like that because it was staticky and I could see the call symbols and stuff like that.

02:11:02.100 --> 02:11:12.300
But, you know, kids, kids today will never understand having to sift through the static to see these or or even better yet when you're trying to watch Cinemax when you didn't pay for it.

02:11:12.300 --> 02:11:20.260
And it's like, I think I saw a boob in like a wavy green type of filter.

02:11:21.180 --> 02:11:30.580
I remember when we first got cable in our town and there was there was a remote, but it was a wired box and it wasn't numbers.

02:11:30.580 --> 02:11:34.100
It was number so you got the 13 and then it was letters.

02:11:34.100 --> 02:11:35.620
So you're telling the dial.

02:11:35.660 --> 02:11:39.220
I just remember it being at my cousin's house at Nickelodeon was Channel K.

02:11:39.300 --> 02:11:41.180
That was the main thing that I really cared about.

02:11:41.180 --> 02:11:55.980
I remember I remember that I was I remember that and I remember I remember in the mid 80s like we had a cable thing here was it was like Jones cable or something or it was in Roseville where I grew up before like Comcast bought them all out.

02:11:56.260 --> 02:12:07.020
They had like a thing on they had a service like in the mid 80s where you could like download games to your TV and play these games on your like remote.

02:12:07.700 --> 02:12:13.620
And this was like way before this became commonplace in like the day and age of apps.

02:12:13.860 --> 02:12:16.980
So like, I don't know why that didn't really catch on more.

02:12:16.980 --> 02:12:19.820
But like, I remember thinking that was, you know, it's way ahead of its time.

02:12:23.380 --> 02:12:25.260
Yeah, crazy stuff anyway.

02:12:25.740 --> 02:12:26.260
All right.

02:12:26.820 --> 02:12:29.860
Well, my friend, is there anything else you want to share with us or?

02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:31.220
One thing.

02:12:31.420 --> 02:12:31.820
Yeah.

02:12:31.820 --> 02:12:35.540
If Uchon does Maria, you have to do Prince Peach.

02:12:36.540 --> 02:12:37.580
I'm open to that.

02:12:37.580 --> 02:12:38.260
That'll be fun.

02:12:38.700 --> 02:12:42.740
You have to throw the fish out and just dye it a nice peach pinkish color.

02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:43.900
You will look so boss.

02:12:44.060 --> 02:12:47.500
Well, maybe maybe I want to be Prince Rose-lin.

02:12:47.500 --> 02:12:50.340
I don't I don't know how to boyify that name, but who cares?

02:12:51.500 --> 02:12:52.900
Oh, Ross-lin.

02:12:54.060 --> 02:12:56.020
You could just be like Prince Ross.

02:12:56.060 --> 02:12:57.300
Yeah, yeah, Prince Ross.

02:12:57.460 --> 02:13:03.380
Or maybe I want to be instead of Daisy, I would be Daniel, I guess.

02:13:03.420 --> 02:13:04.020
Daffodil.

02:13:06.220 --> 02:13:10.580
I think that you've got to get Allen in on this and you got to go to Uchon.

02:13:10.700 --> 02:13:13.940
The fangirls would lose their shit, especially if they see the wedding rings.

02:13:13.980 --> 02:13:18.500
OK, I kind of love the idea of Allen and I both doing it.

02:13:18.500 --> 02:13:20.980
And one of us is Peach and the other one is Daisy.

02:13:21.420 --> 02:13:21.920
Yes.

02:13:22.340 --> 02:13:23.700
That that might have to happen.

02:13:25.740 --> 02:13:28.580
If it does, I may have to fly out for that convention.

02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:29.420
Seriously.

02:13:29.420 --> 02:13:31.380
Yeah, I think it might be.

02:13:31.380 --> 02:13:33.420
Well, you have Prince Peach and Duke Daisy.

02:13:33.420 --> 02:13:35.700
It might be better if either way around.

02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:39.180
I know it might be better if I'm Daisy, though, because like J.D. says in chat.

02:13:39.380 --> 02:13:40.700
Hi, I'm Daisy.

02:13:42.300 --> 02:13:43.820
I have to go around the con.

02:13:44.060 --> 02:13:45.300
Hi, I'm Daisy.

02:13:47.260 --> 02:13:48.780
And I don't think Allen would want to do that.

02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:49.700
All right.

02:13:50.380 --> 02:13:53.860
Anyway, but I think Allen would be more than happy to say Peach is the winner.

02:13:54.180 --> 02:13:56.700
All right. Anyway, I'm going to let you go, my friend.

02:13:56.700 --> 02:13:57.900
But thank you so much for the call.

02:13:58.420 --> 02:13:59.620
No problem. I'll take care.

02:13:59.660 --> 02:14:00.980
Bye, I'm Daisy.

02:14:03.860 --> 02:14:05.180
Oh, my God, I'm dying.

02:14:06.060 --> 02:14:09.660
J.D. in chat says, swear to God, Super Smash Ultimate had better have.

02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:11.580
Hi, I'm Daisy. Be a taunt.

02:14:11.580 --> 02:14:13.500
Oh, if it's not, return it.

02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:14.860
Throw it in the trash.

02:14:14.860 --> 02:14:18.060
If it's not an actual time in the game, it better, it better.

02:14:18.620 --> 02:14:19.660
All right.

02:14:19.660 --> 02:14:21.220
We're going to go ahead and close up Skype for now.

02:14:21.220 --> 02:14:23.540
If you didn't get through, you want to say something to us.

02:14:23.540 --> 02:14:24.380
You can always email us.

02:14:24.380 --> 02:14:26.980
Participate at orange lounge radio dot com.

02:14:26.980 --> 02:14:29.220
I bet they're going to have the rapids in there.

02:14:29.220 --> 02:14:32.700
They might. I that would because then they could do like as a character,

02:14:32.900 --> 02:14:34.340
you know, costumes.

02:14:34.340 --> 02:14:38.820
Yeah, they have all the weird like rabbits that they have in the Mario Kingdom battle,

02:14:38.980 --> 02:14:42.940
which is another game that my son has played that I still haven't played yet

02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:44.700
because the Mario Kingdom. Yeah, we have.

02:14:44.700 --> 02:14:46.380
Well, we just haven't played it. All right.

02:14:46.380 --> 02:14:48.100
I haven't played it. He's played it.

02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:51.020
Well, we're going to wrap up another episode of Orange Lounge Radio with that.

02:14:51.020 --> 02:14:54.180
Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show and supporting us.

02:14:54.180 --> 02:14:57.500
If you like what you heard here at Orange, Andrea, tell a friend or two about the show,

02:14:57.500 --> 02:14:59.580
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:14:59.580 --> 02:15:02.420
But if the voices aren't here to put out on the air,

02:15:03.340 --> 02:15:04.300
how can we hear them?

02:15:04.300 --> 02:15:05.900
So, yeah, tell a friend.

02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:09.740
Leave a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Google Play podcast

02:15:09.740 --> 02:15:11.660
or wherever it is you found this show.

02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:14.140
Those go a really long way. Let me tell you.

02:15:14.140 --> 02:15:17.460
And I know I say that every week, but it seems like nobody ever does it.

02:15:17.460 --> 02:15:21.180
So please, you know, if you have five seconds to help us out,

02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:23.860
I really, really, really appreciate it.

02:15:23.860 --> 02:15:25.820
So that's going to do it.

02:15:25.820 --> 02:15:27.740
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:15:27.740 --> 02:15:28.860
Dark Sakura, I'll start with you.

02:15:29.860 --> 02:15:31.380
Wasps suck.

02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:36.220
I got stung in the chin by the same two wasps and had allergic reactions, of course.

02:15:36.220 --> 02:15:39.100
And that was a week and a half ago.

02:15:39.100 --> 02:15:40.900
And it looks like it's finally starting to heal.

02:15:40.900 --> 02:15:43.340
But now it's peeling and it hurts.

02:15:43.340 --> 02:15:46.660
Wasps are assholes.

02:15:46.660 --> 02:15:48.660
And vote.

02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:52.940
My final thought is I had a really good time going out randomly last night,

02:15:52.940 --> 02:15:57.100
but I have to remind myself that I still can get hangovers.

02:15:57.140 --> 02:16:00.180
And thank God mine went away before the show tonight.

02:16:00.180 --> 02:16:01.740
Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:16:01.740 --> 02:16:07.180
Uh, wasps like making nests at our house and I like spraying them with poison.

02:16:08.060 --> 02:16:09.860
So there's that.

02:16:09.860 --> 02:16:12.180
Hooray for poison.

02:16:12.980 --> 02:16:14.140
All right. That's it.

02:16:14.140 --> 02:16:15.500
That's going to do it for another episode.

02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:18.140
We'll see you in seven days to do it all again.

02:16:18.140 --> 02:16:20.820
