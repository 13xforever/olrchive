0	17720	In the year of the remaster I was pleasantly surprised to see Turok released on Steam and
17720	21920	now the same company is bringing the N64 release of Forsaken back to PC and the Xbox One as
21920	22920	well.
22920	25800	Engage your six degrees of freedom and join us for another episode of the show where every
25800	29800	gamer has a voice.
29800	34880	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
34880	35880	Welcome back.
35880	38040	It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
38040	45760	It's Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 739 for this July 29th of 2018.
45760	51520	Oh my gosh, I can't believe August is almost here and then that means fall is around the
51520	55400	corner and all the holiday games are around the corner.
55400	56400	Crazy time.
56400	59960	Anyway, I am Rob Roberts here to talk about video games and gaming culture, the gaming
59960	63800	lifestyle with you here on the show with my co-hosts.
63800	67600	Say hello as always to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
67600	68600	Hi.
68600	69600	Hi, how are you?
69600	70600	I'm okay.
70600	71600	Yeah?
71600	72600	You were coming through quiet there for a minute.
72600	73600	Yeah.
73600	74600	We're good.
74600	75600	We're good.
75600	76600	Yesterday was a busy day.
76600	77600	Yeah?
77600	78600	Well, you went to California Stream, right?
78600	79600	I did.
79600	81600	You want to tell us a little bit about that?
81600	84600	There were lots of video games, lots of noise.
84600	85600	Yeah.
85600	91280	Lots of lights, lots of headaches, which I still have a bit of one today, but I had
91280	92280	a great time.
92280	96760	I played a bunch of stuff and I'll talk about it when I talk about what I played, but there
96760	101200	was a bit of a rarity there and that was a pop-in stage.
101200	103400	Oh, is that the dancing thing?
103400	104880	Yes, it is completely non-intuitive.
104880	107160	Huh.
107160	108960	I did not enjoy it.
108960	109960	I don't think I've ever played that.
109960	112560	I didn't even know they had one of those in the Bay Area.
112560	113560	I love theater.
114560	117160	That's kind of a newer game for California Extreme to have.
117160	118160	You know what I mean?
118160	121680	Yeah, it was really fun, but only like two songs that was kind of, I'm glad I didn't
121680	122680	pay for it.
122680	123680	Yeah.
123680	126240	But I'll talk more about that in my gaming week.
126240	127240	Sounds good.
127240	129920	So for those that don't know, if you've never heard of it, California Stream is a big thing
129920	134960	that they have here in the Bay Area where they basically fill a ballroom at a hotel
134960	139840	with, it's supposed to be classic arcade games, but it sounds like they put a lot of contemporary
139840	140840	stuff in there too.
140840	141840	Especially-
141840	142840	Oh, it's all across the spectrum.
143520	146920	And old and new pinball because they had the Iron Maiden machines out.
146920	150000	Because didn't it start as a pinball thing and then kind of grew into this other stuff
150000	151000	too?
151000	152000	I don't know.
152000	153000	It's been a long time.
153000	154000	So, huh.
154000	155000	All right.
155000	156000	Interesting.
156000	157000	Anyhow, I'm also joining us in studio.
157000	158560	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
158560	159560	Hello.
159560	160560	How are you?
160560	161560	I'm good.
161560	162560	You were playing with wires down there.
162560	163560	Everything okay?
163560	164800	Well, yeah, because my laptop said it wasn't charging.
164800	165800	I was like, oh, that's not good.
165800	166800	That's weird.
166800	167800	It's plugged in.
167800	168800	You're going to need that.
168800	170020	So apparently a cord is loose.
170020	171680	No California Stream for you, sadly.
171680	172680	No.
173520	176400	I could have gone, but I had a big show last night.
176400	181460	The clue on stage that I talked about a few previous weeks happened last night.
181460	184660	So my week was obviously very busy preparing for that.
184660	189440	And today I'm just in like, I left the house once.
189440	194640	I left the house once today to walk up the street to go raid an Alola Marowak.
194640	197720	That's the only time I've left the house today.
197720	200080	And probably will be the only time I leave the house today.
200080	201080	So anyway.
201520	205680	But I would have loved to have gone to California Stream, except that it's always inevitably
205680	208480	on some weekend where I have something else going on.
208480	209480	Summer's a busy time.
209480	210480	What can I say?
210480	212040	I didn't even know it was this weekend.
212040	213040	Yeah.
213040	214040	Like it snuck up on me.
214040	218280	I got a text from our buddy Melody just out of the blue.
218280	221240	Like that was like, are you coming to California Stream?
221240	222840	And I was, I think it was something like that.
222840	225600	And I was like, oh, well, no clue is also tomorrow.
225600	228840	So, and I was like, dang, I didn't even realize it was this weekend.
228840	229840	Oh, well.
229840	231680	I'm glad to hear it was a good show at least.
231680	234320	And that fun was had by some people.
234320	236280	It was good.
236280	237280	Anyway.
237280	240600	Um, so any exciting stuff going on in your week, Loki?
240600	243840	Um, no, not really.
243840	247240	I mean, just still working on unreal programming.
247240	248240	Okay.
248240	249240	Sticking with that.
249240	250240	Been doing at least like a few hours a day.
250240	253480	I saw some of your tweets that you're really liking some of like the, I guess, like templates
253480	254480	and stuff that they do.
254480	257960	Well, it's just like they have the way the engine's built because I mean, it's unreal
257960	258960	engine.
259080	260400	And you can use it for first person shooters.
260400	262160	I mean, that's what they built it on.
262160	267120	And so of course they have a lot of stuff built for shooter games.
267120	270920	And so they have a lot of these things you would normally have to make all the time,
270920	276160	like projectile scripts and stuff for different types of cameras for third person, you know,
276160	278840	shooter cameras or first person shooter cameras.
278840	280200	They have a lot of that built in them.
280200	284800	Unity has some of that too, but I don't know, I kind of like the way that they set this
284800	285800	up a little bit.
285800	291600	And the hang of blueprints and kind of figuring out how that translates into normal code.
291600	294320	Because there's a whole lot of like, I'm going to have to go through after I'm done with
294320	297840	this, I'm going to have to go through a bunch of different blueprint courses that kind of
297840	302600	learn all of the ins and outs of what it can do.
302600	306840	Because there's a lot of features there, but I like it and I like how it makes everything
306840	310560	easy to make look good, I guess.
310560	312120	All right, cool.
312120	314720	So does this mean your game is a first person shooter that you're making?
314720	315720	No.
316640	319360	I thought we thought we might have got some confirmation in there.
319360	320360	I tried you guys.
320360	322100	Anyway, let's go to our chat.
322100	323160	Say hello to our chatters.
323160	327880	We do, of course, tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,
327880	332920	vognetwork.com, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf
332920	333920	show.
333920	339920	And you can chat along with us at live.vognetwork.com, where actf says Alola Marowak was worth it.
339920	344120	I never thought I would be so excited to catch a Marowak, because I don't know about you
344120	347880	guys, but like Cubones are like herpes here.
347880	349020	They're everywhere, right?
349020	354140	So I have tons of regular Marowaks, but the Alola Marowak is so cool with like the fire
354140	355140	thing.
355140	356540	And the only way you can get them right now is in raids.
356540	359060	They didn't even put them in the eggs.
359060	364320	So yeah, it was kind of worth it actually, even though it didn't end up highest appraisal.
364320	366880	But I mean, how often do you actually battle with Marowak?
366880	367880	Probably not very often.
367880	372520	Sometimes, sometimes it's about putting cool stuff in gyms though, because I was able to
372520	378880	get a Torque Hole from Shane, who is at the actual Go Fest or whatever they call it in
378880	380680	Chicago, where they had a ton of them.
380680	382320	So he brought me back a Torque Hole.
382320	385800	So I just started putting Torque Hole in gyms around here, just so that people could get
385800	387840	the Dex entry if they didn't already have it.
387840	392680	So you know, kind of fun, even though they don't get the full, full entry without actually
392680	393880	capturing a Torque Hole.
393880	398840	So hopefully there'll be more opportunities to catch some of those things that are typically
398840	399840	region locked.
399840	403600	I know the only things I need now are region locked Mr. Mime and Kangaskhan.
403600	404600	That's all I need.
404600	407840	So I'm going to hope that maybe I can get some at Dragon Con because people come from
407840	409520	all around the world to Dragon Con.
409520	412160	So I'm hoping there'll be like a trading outpost or something where like maybe I could trade
412160	414960	some Tauros, which is the exclusive here.
414960	416760	But here's the other funny thing.
416760	419120	I didn't mean to make this a Pokemon Go podcast, but deal with it.
419120	421600	A lot of people were playing.
421600	427920	On my flight back from Dragon Con this year, I go to the Austin airport and I believe Austin
427920	432600	is far enough South where I can get Corrosola, I think.
432600	436240	So I'm going to try to get one at the airport because I think I have a layover of like 90
436240	437240	minutes.
437240	438240	So everybody cross your fingers.
438240	442920	Although I think, I think technically I think JD actually, when he was in Florida, brought
442920	447000	back some stuff to trade, but it would be cool to catch one of my own and then I could
447000	449280	get more to bring back to trade for some of the other people around here.
449280	450280	So we'll see.
450280	451280	We'll see.
451280	452280	Anyway.
452280	454920	Um, other comments and chat over at live.vognover.com.
454920	455920	Okay.
455920	459960	One more Pokemon comment here from SSG100Matt, who says I've not gotten a chance to get an
459960	460960	Alolan Marowak.
460960	462880	I did get an Alolan Raichu.
462880	467760	It doesn't seem like the Marowak spawn very often, um, but, and you need, you need a group
467760	468920	to do Marowak.
468920	472280	You can solo Raichu if you're a higher level.
472280	475400	I soloed it, but I only had like 12 seconds left on the clock.
475400	479300	Uh, but I just used like the recommended Pokemon too, which aren't always the best.
479300	484580	The recommended are usually more better defenders than attackers, but, um, I only, I did it
484580	485580	with weather boost.
485580	487700	I had like 12 seconds left, but I do, I was able to solo it.
487700	494420	So you can solo Alolan Raichu, but if you can duo it for the insurance, it's probably
494420	495700	a lot easier.
495700	496700	All right.
496700	501180	Anyway, uh, let's move on and talk about something that's an, I do love Pokemon Go, but I'm sure
501180	503020	it's going to come up in gaming weeks too.
503020	506540	Let's talk about some other games and a little story to kick us off.
506540	510740	Uh, because we like it when video games, I don't know about you guys, but I like when
510740	514700	I see video games represented kind of like in the mainstream stuff.
514700	518660	Like not that, I don't think gaming necessarily needs that validation at this point because
518660	520300	I know we've talked about it before.
520300	525400	I think as you know, our generation is getting older, that sort of that, I really don't like
525400	529500	to use the term Zillennial, but you know what I'm talking about?
529500	534060	Like kind of that window right between generation X and millennial, right?
534060	539060	Kind of like as that generation is getting older, like we all know video games.
539060	543460	Like even if like you had friends that play video games or you know, people do video games.
543460	546780	So it's not that we necessarily need the validation, but it's still kind of cool to see stuff on
546780	548500	mainstream TV.
548500	554200	So for example, uh, the Overwatch league had their finals on and we, we talked about this
554200	559620	last week show, but the finals really were on ESPN, uh, this weekend and the London Spitfire
559620	560620	won the whole thing.
560620	562660	Um, and I know some people were really into that watching it.
562660	564980	They had it at a huge arena, the Barclays arena.
564980	569940	So they did it at a like more like an arena that would typically have like basketball
569940	570940	and stuff.
570940	575060	Um, instead of the custom one, that's basically a TV studio that Blizzard built, I'm a little
575060	576420	closer to their home.
576420	579620	So I mean, it's pretty cool to see that kind of validation.
579620	583380	Um, but then this one, in my opinion, kind of came out of nowhere.
583380	588540	Somebody tweeted this at me because I don't, I don't always watch this show, but, um, you
588540	593060	guys ever watched America's Got Talent, that show it's been on for years now.
593060	594700	It's on like it's 13 season or something.
594700	595700	I don't know what you're talking.
595700	596700	No.
596700	597700	Yes.
597700	598700	I've seen a show.
598700	599700	Well, here's my, okay.
599700	604020	I don't really watch America's Got Talent, but those videos from all those guys, cause
604020	606740	no matter what country you live in, they have one of these shows, they have the Britain's
606740	607740	Got Talent.
607740	608740	They have, they have everything.
608740	612100	Everybody's got talent, which is a talent filled world, right?
612100	615080	So everybody has talent and nobody has talent.
615080	619460	So these, these talent things show up all the time on Facebook because it will be like,
619460	621700	look at this 11 year old girl that sings opera.
621700	622700	So beautiful.
622700	625900	Make you cry or look at this girl who plays the ukulele.
625900	629940	She's so, you know, she's got a story that will break your heart and check out this eight
629940	633500	year old boy that's singing a song about his mom who's dying of cancer and like all these
633500	636040	like, like it's emotional porn.
636040	638940	That show is emotional pornography.
638940	640660	It's Facebook.
640660	641660	It's forward.
641660	642660	Garbage.
642660	643660	It is.
643660	644660	It is.
644660	648220	But it's totally like, and I eat it up like, you know, just like, you know, sometimes you
648220	654680	want real pornography for reasons, so I'm going to say sometimes you want emotional
654680	658020	pornography because I just want to cry.
658020	663020	I need, I need to have a good cry, so I'm going to watch some emotional pornography.
663020	664020	What Loki?
664020	666460	You don't, you don't fall down the well of emotional pornography ever.
666460	670580	No, no, it's just, it's dark soccer.
670580	673380	Well of regular pornography.
673380	675380	Where are these wells filled with pornography?
675380	679300	This is, well Facebook has, and then the other one, well of garbage.
679300	684380	That's like, that's like I'm dumping a drip, jumping into the dumpster there.
684380	689220	A porn hub would be the other, I suppose, I guess a dark, dark soccer.
689220	692500	Do you ever, do you ever sit there for hours and hours and watch emotional pornography?
692500	693500	No.
693500	694500	No.
694500	695500	What is it?
695500	696500	Just me.
696500	697500	Chad.
697500	698500	I do.
698500	699500	I do watch animal cops.
699500	700500	Houston.
700500	701500	Okay.
701500	702500	Okay.
702500	705660	So cute cat videos can totally be emotional pornography.
705660	709380	Like if you just want to sit there and watch cute cat videos for an hour, that's totally
709380	710380	emotional porn.
710380	712900	It's just a different, it's just a different type.
712900	716100	Just like real pornography, many different types.
716100	717380	Okay.
717380	724220	So anyway, on my favorite emotional porn show this week, uh, we had a choir that was on
724220	725220	performing.
725220	730140	It was the Angel City Choral, I think is the name of their group and they are from the
730140	731140	Los Angeles area.
731140	734780	And the big thing is that they're a very diverse group of people.
734780	739700	You know, you've got all sorts of diversity when it comes to races, ethnicity, sexuality,
739700	743300	age, like, you know, political leanings and all that stuff.
743300	744300	That's kind of like their big thing.
744300	745740	They all come together to sing.
745740	750880	Well, they already got through on the first, so I guess the way the show works, there's
750880	752600	like the auditions, right?
752600	756780	So they got through on the auditions with their rendition of, I kid you not, Toto's
756780	763060	Africa, which I know that song is all the rage right now, but they legit did that song
763060	764060	and it was really good.
764060	767860	Like I saw that one too on one of my emotional porn binges and they did a really good job
767860	768860	on that.
768860	773420	Well, they were back this week for, I guess the judges cut as they try to narrow it down,
773420	775580	I think to like the top 32 or something.
775580	780940	So during the judges cut, they sang this one, which some of you gamers, especially the one
780940	783860	that listened to this show might recognize.
783860	795980	Do you recognize this at all?
795980	800140	Yeah, I've played it on OLR before.
800140	804860	We actually had the guy who made this song on OLR some time ago.
804860	807060	It's Baba Yetu from Civilization IV.
807060	813060	It's the epic title opening sequence, which went on to be the first gaming song that got
813060	814060	a Grammy.
814060	817860	Well, I didn't realize this, but apparently that song, maybe because of the fact that
817860	821920	it won the Grammy, it's become kind of like one of the standards.
821920	827860	There's many high schools and so forth that do adaptations of this and well deserved on
827860	828860	Christopher Tin.
828860	829860	It's a great song.
829860	831520	I think most people that have heard this love this song.
831520	834980	And I would say, again, if you like this song, you need to go look up the song he did in
834980	837600	Civilization VI, the Dream of Flight.
837600	838800	I can't remember.
838800	841100	It's in Italian, but it translates to Dream of Flight.
841100	842100	That song is amazing too.
842100	847660	But anyway, Baba Yetu, which is Swahili, if I remember right, for the Lord's Prayer.
847660	850460	That's the song that was on America's Got Talent.
850460	852420	This is kind of an interesting twist though.
852420	858200	So the way it works, I guess they do like 12 acts in an episode and there's a guest
858200	862140	judge there every week because there's like the regular judges like Heidi Klum and Scary
862140	863940	Spice, like the regular judges.
863940	867900	But then there's a guest judge every week and the guest judge can press the golden buzzer
867900	868900	for one act.
868900	873080	Well, the golden busser was press on these guys because it was a really good performance
873080	875880	if you haven't watched it already yet.
875880	879260	But it was pressed by Olivia Munn, which I thought was kind of interesting.
879260	880620	So that was pretty cool.
880620	886500	I wonder if she recognized the song because she's a bit of a gamer, right?
886500	887500	Probably.
887500	888500	Yeah.
888500	889500	So wasn't she on Attack of the Show for a short while?
889500	890500	If I remember right.
890500	891500	Yeah.
891500	893500	So kind of interesting.
894060	896460	Anyhow, so they moved on with that.
896460	899740	Sadly, I don't think I saw the name of the song get checked.
899740	903340	I don't think I heard Christopher Tin get name checked or anything like that, but it
903340	908460	was still one of those moments of, wait a minute, I know this because of a video game.
908460	912340	So it's kind of curious, like if you guys have had any moments, I'll open this up to
912340	913340	chat as well.
913340	914340	I don't know.
914340	916580	And I know I'm springing this on you guys in studio, but maybe you have something that
916580	917980	jumps off top of your head.
917980	923260	Do you have any moments where you've seen like video gaming get represented in a mainstream
923260	927900	culture and you're like, oh, I know that because I'm a gamer.
927900	929780	Have you ever kind of like had that?
929780	935180	I mean, Loki, I imagine like the movie Ready Player One was nothing but that.
935180	940300	So I'm not sure that's the best place to start, but I guess it was a Spielberg movies.
940300	946100	I love calling out what games people are playing on TV dramas.
946100	949660	Like what they're playing on, like, you know, older systems and stuff like that, for example,
949660	952380	house to my wife's displeased.
952380	955780	She's very displeased when I do that, when they think, oh, that's GTA.
955780	957180	Oh, hey, that's Spider-Man.
957180	958620	Oh, hey, that's this.
958620	961300	When they're playing Call of Duty, but it has Atari 2600 noises.
961300	962300	That's right.
962300	967940	He had like a PSP that he got in in one of them, because, you know, Sony tie in probably.
967940	969300	So like I kept calling it.
969300	970300	I'm like, yeah, it's a PSP.
970300	972300	She's like, just stop.
972300	973300	Don't do that.
973300	975500	Jamie, anything that jumps in your mind?
975500	979180	Like I know you don't watch a ton of television, but Ralph, what's OK.
979180	980180	OK.
980180	981180	I like that.
981180	982500	Disney hopping on it.
982500	983500	Yeah.
983500	984500	Disney embracing the gaming culture.
984500	985580	That's a good answer, too.
985580	989220	And I think that's something where gaming culture has kind of embraced it back.
989220	991420	And you know, we're getting a Wreck-It Ralph, too.
991420	995220	And yeah, I think a lot of people watch Wreck-It Ralph to try to catch all the little subtle
995220	996220	references.
996220	997220	That shitty Pixels movie.
997220	1004940	I mean, that was definitely a mainstream attempt to capture.
1004940	1006140	Attempt is a good word.
1006140	1008500	There was an attempt, Jamie.
1008500	1011540	There was an attempt.
1011540	1015540	My point is just that even, you know, there's that attempt.
1015540	1021820	So yeah, looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Tiger Claw says most would know Olivia Munn
1021820	1025060	as Psylocke in X-Men Apocalypse.
1025060	1030300	I believe if I'm not mistaken, she was also the I always get the two Olivia's confused.
1030300	1031300	She's not.
1031300	1032580	She's not the one in Tron Legacy.
1032580	1034180	That's the that's a different Olivia.
1034180	1035620	Oh, it's the different.
1035620	1036620	It's the other one.
1036620	1037620	Olivia Wilde.
1037620	1038620	Olivia Wilde is.
1038620	1039620	Yeah.
1039620	1044100	So no, Olivia Munn was the girlfriend in Magic Mike.
1044100	1048380	I don't know why my mind goes to Magic Mike, but there you go.
1048380	1051980	Probably because of that porn well that you're talking about.
1051980	1055100	Anyway, how dare you?
1055100	1059900	Bobby Blackwolf points out the MLB All-Star game had a segment about Fortnite and the
1059900	1061980	players favorite dances.
1061980	1062980	Dang.
1062980	1065300	Fortnite is like that game that everybody is freaking.
1065300	1069140	It's like the Minecraft, I guess, of of 2018.
1069140	1074040	Bobby Blackwolf also points out Baba Yetu is now the number three downloaded classical
1074040	1075540	song on iTunes this week.
1075540	1076540	So it got around.
1076540	1077540	You're right.
1077540	1081500	Probably, you know, it was probably labeled with it as that video was circulating the
1081500	1083540	emotional porn circuit.
1083540	1087740	So yeah, I'm sure Baba Yetu got a nice little bounce thanks to that mainstream exposure.
1087740	1091580	And that's part of why, like, even if you're the type where you're like, who cares about
1091580	1092580	the mainstream?
1092580	1094220	I like to go against the mainstream.
1094220	1095220	That's fine.
1095220	1101100	But realize that, you know, that that exposure in the mainstream still goes a long way for
1101100	1105060	getting coined for these people like Christopher Ten that, you know, created these songs and
1105060	1106060	so forth.
1106060	1108100	So let's see other stuff.
1108100	1109660	Oh, yeah.
1109660	1113940	Kaijuto says I saw Mario Brothers represented on Dancing with the Stars.
1113940	1114940	I remember that was recently.
1114940	1117220	That was a couple of years like in the past year or two.
1117220	1118220	I remember seeing that, too.
1118220	1119220	That's pretty funny.
1119220	1123020	Yeah, but I don't like to include where it's represented in that cringe.
1123020	1124620	That's true.
1124620	1126300	Let's see.
1126300	1130020	Bobby Blocko says seeing Will Wright interviewed on Colbert Report.
1130020	1131020	Yeah.
1131020	1133780	Speaking of late night TV, late night TV has been embraced that more and more.
1133780	1137380	I know Jimmy Fallon because there's Jimmy Fallon likes games anyway.
1137380	1138380	Yeah.
1138380	1139380	There's two Olivia's and there's two Jimmy's.
1139380	1140780	Also Jimmy Kimmel.
1140780	1142980	Jimmy Fallon had Reggie on.
1142980	1146200	Remember when the switch was coming out and there was that infamous thing with Miyamoto
1146200	1149540	in the audience with like the thumbs down and turning to the thumbs up.
1149540	1152180	That was from Jimmy Kimmel or Jimmy.
1152180	1153180	God damn it.
1153180	1154180	Jimmy Fallon.
1154180	1156820	Remember, Fallon's the one that lasted himself.
1156820	1157820	All right.
1157820	1158820	Just like me.
1158820	1159820	No, it's all right.
1159820	1160820	It's funny.
1160820	1166380	I couldn't stand Fallon in SNL, but when he hit late night, it was actually much better.
1166380	1171820	Act Deft says not sure if related, but there was a national TV channel in Mexico that used
1171820	1175980	don't know if they still do music from many video games in their news segments.
1175980	1180860	There would be stuff from Silent Hill even in some of those.
1180860	1183500	Why do you have Silent Hill music on the news?
1183500	1190420	Like that's kind of today we opened up a new, that's what I feel about American news.
1190420	1191420	I hate that.
1191420	1192420	I'm laughing at that, but it's true.
1192420	1200940	We've opened up a new mall, Silent Hill music, free puppies, you know, uh, guys, you know,
1200940	1205100	pointing out rocket league was on blackish, uh, that I've heard a lot of good things about
1205100	1206100	that show.
1206100	1208940	I haven't seen it myself yet, but I know that's on ABC and does very well.
1208940	1213340	Uh, Bob Coffey kind of piggybacking on the Mexico thing saying Japan does that with news
1213340	1218780	sometimes and probably because, um, you know, video gaming probably got embedded in mainstream
1218780	1222500	Japanese culture before it really got embedded in ours.
1222500	1224180	Anyway, those are some good answers.
1224180	1225180	You guys.
1225180	1226180	Thank you.
1226180	1230380	I like, you know, I like seeing these games like, Oh, you know, it shows up somewhere.
1230380	1231380	It's pretty cool.
1231380	1235860	Anyway, let's talk a little bit about some games that we saw this week and talk a little
1235860	1237500	bit about our gaming weeks.
1237540	1241260	So dark soccer, I know, I'm sure you got tons of classic games to talk about.
1241260	1242260	Yeah.
1242260	1243260	I have to pull out the list.
1243260	1244260	All right.
1244260	1245260	It's a three hour show.
1245260	1246260	Jamie.
1246260	1249060	Well, I, I, I was lately, it's only been two.
1249060	1252580	I was pretty, um, particular about what I played.
1252580	1258580	So in, um, so played Beatmania three, the final, which of course, but then I got mad
1258580	1262880	at Dan cause he, he tried to join in with me, which of course put it in co-op mode,
1262880	1264820	which I hate about five key.
1264820	1265820	Yeah.
1265940	1268380	And then doesn't like, you only play like alternating notes or something.
1268380	1269380	Yeah.
1269380	1270900	So, or parts of different parts of the song.
1270900	1275180	So I just waited for it to fail us so I could play by myself again.
1275180	1280140	And then, uh, Ray crisis, they had a bunch of candy cabs, you know, the Japanese cabinets.
1280140	1282980	So it played, um, Ray crisis, which was a lot of fun.
1282980	1288700	Um, then we went upstairs to the console room and played streets of rage to win a Sega Genesis,
1288700	1294300	which was pretty fun to, um, pop and stage, which I did have to give it a try and decided
1294300	1295300	it's not for me.
1295300	1298220	It just is not intuitive to play.
1298220	1301940	And then it played theaters, um, uh, final fantasy all star carnival, which was super
1301940	1302940	fun.
1302940	1308260	I love theater them in the arcade, then, uh, riding DX, which is one of my favorite shooters
1308260	1315740	like ever because of the purple Rappy laser, um, played donkey Kong on a, uh, uh, sit down
1315740	1322620	table and I hate the controller on it because it's, um, it's coming out horizontally instead
1322620	1324260	of on a little shelf vertically.
1324260	1326140	So I really don't like it.
1326140	1333100	Um, I played another game called Mamoru Koon curse, which is like a running shooter and
1333100	1336300	slightly bullet hellish, but it was really a fun game.
1336300	1343140	Um, I played another real bullet hell game that I completely bombed at called AKA V blue.
1343140	1346540	Um, it was, it was pretty fun.
1346540	1347540	Very pretty.
1347540	1349220	I like the shell, the cell shaded style of it.
1349220	1350220	Oh yeah.
1350220	1351220	I love that game.
1351220	1352220	Yeah.
1352820	1356260	It was, uh, it was on the, um, the dreamcast hardware.
1356260	1358780	I forget the Naomi hardware, I think.
1358780	1360340	I think it's newer than that.
1360340	1361340	No, you're right.
1361340	1364380	It's, uh, it's much newer than that.
1364380	1365380	I can't remember.
1365380	1371260	Was it, is it dolphin blue is what that was or cause I think that's what it is in English.
1371260	1374220	No, it's basically red versus blue.
1374220	1375220	AKA is red.
1375220	1376220	Hmm.
1376220	1380420	Maybe I think I'll send you a picture of, of what it looked like, but it was, it was
1380620	1381620	pretty good.
1381620	1382620	Pretty good shooter.
1382620	1384460	Um, it was just really tough.
1384460	1390460	Um, I played, um, they had a dragon ball fighter Z, um, arcade set up, although it was the
1390460	1393060	console version with arcade cabinet stuff.
1393060	1395540	So it was fun.
1395540	1398800	These two guys were just like continuing over and over and over.
1398800	1404760	So I made a very salty, gee, it would be nice if other people get to play and they both
1404760	1408300	looked chagrined and you know, eventually got up.
1408300	1410500	Um, I played another game.
1410500	1415460	Well, before that I played dual Donpach, which of course, you know, fun game.
1415460	1419020	It's on, it's got an iOS release too, although it's still expensive.
1419020	1420020	Really?
1420020	1421020	Hmm.
1421020	1422020	That's a fun thing.
1422020	1423020	Donpach like the thing.
1423020	1425400	Um, I played music gun gun.
1425400	1426500	Have you seen that one?
1426500	1429540	Uh, is that the one that's like gigantic?
1429540	1430540	It's like a gigantic machine.
1430540	1433700	I think I've seen it around one where you have like the gun, you shoot in the rhythm.
1433700	1434700	Yeah.
1434700	1435700	That game is interesting.
1435700	1436700	That game was pretty fun.
1437100	1438980	Um, I played the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
1438980	1439980	It's no point blank.
1439980	1440980	No, but it's really fun.
1440980	1441980	Okay.
1441980	1444980	But I played the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the one based off of the CG.
1444980	1445980	Wake up, Tigerclaw.
1445980	1446980	Wake up.
1446980	1451260	The one based off the CG, you know, kids show version.
1451260	1456780	Melody and I took turns on that one because, um, they were on the final boss rush.
1456780	1457780	Oh.
1457780	1460380	And I got a little bit tired, so she took over playing Raphael.
1460380	1461380	It was pretty fun.
1461380	1462380	That's cool.
1462380	1463380	Yeah.
1463380	1464380	It's a neat game.
1464380	1465500	Did it kind of remind you of the old one?
1465500	1466500	Yeah.
1467300	1469300	But, man, Raphael has no freaking range.
1469300	1472900	Um, but he did still have like the slam back and forth move.
1472900	1473900	That one was pretty fun.
1473900	1478500	Um, then I played, uh, God Plus, which I'm probably going to do that as a classic game
1478500	1479500	at some point.
1479500	1483700	God Plus, for those who don't know, is, um, Galaga 3.
1483700	1488060	It was renamed as Galaga 3 because people didn't realize that God Plus was the same
1488060	1491700	one, which the funny thing about it is you can get this little weapon if you shoot a
1491700	1497580	particular enemy that gives you like a vacuum funnel and you can absorb some of the enemies
1497580	1502020	and then they become shooter options until they get hit.
1502020	1503020	It's pretty neat.
1503020	1509020	Um, then I played Rhythm Tengoku, um, which was, you know, Rhythm Heaven, for those who
1509020	1511420	don't know what Tengoku means by this point.
1511420	1515420	Um, Steel Chronicle Vic Troopers, that was another neat game.
1515460	1522660	Um, basically, it's, uh, behind the, uh, the mech that you're playing, but you have, um,
1522660	1523660	different controls.
1523660	1526660	Like, you have one that controls, like, camera angle and the other one that controls your
1526660	1530140	movement with different, uh, guns and bombs and things.
1530140	1532660	It was a pretty neat, neat little battle game.
1532660	1537500	Um, I played, the only pinball I played was Hyper Ball, which doesn't really pinball,
1537500	1538880	to be honest.
1538880	1539880	And then I played...
1539880	1543300	I was about to ask why you didn't play more pinball, but then I'm like, oh yeah, she can
1543300	1545940	kind of play, like, a lot of pinball at home whenever she wants.
1545940	1548140	Yeah, that's really the truth.
1548140	1552660	Um, then I played Mushihime Tama, which isn't Mushihime Sama, it's Mushihime Tama, where
1552660	1557500	you play the character from Mushihime Sama on a little, like, bubble game.
1557500	1565260	Kind of a little bit of Puyo Puyo meets, um, I don't know, it's just like you have to drop
1565260	1569980	these blobs on the same color and you have, like, an arc, so you either have to do up
1569980	1575780	left or down right to control how your bubbles are going to throw.
1575780	1584340	You control the arc of it, so maybe a little bit of Angry Birds meets Puyo Puyo and how
1584340	1585340	you have to control it.
1585340	1590820	It was a neat little game, I got decently through it, and that was all I played.
1590820	1592820	Alright!
1592820	1594420	Sounds like you still had a very busy day.
1594420	1597340	I had a very busy day, and I bought games.
1597340	1598340	Oh, did you?
1598340	1599540	Dan and I bought some stuff.
1599540	1601540	Yeah, anything a note, real quick?
1601540	1602540	Um, yes.
1602540	1603540	Like, all of it?
1603540	1606780	I bought myself a copy of Dance Summit, because I'm going to give Shane back his as soon as
1606780	1607780	I find it.
1607780	1608780	Oh, cool!
1608780	1610780	Um, 20 bucks, but not bad.
1610780	1612780	That's not bad, no, for that?
1612780	1617300	No, um, I like to buy from Tiny Potato when I'm there.
1617300	1624500	Their prices are, I'm not going to, they're fair for what they're selling, but they do
1624500	1626500	know the value of their stuff.
1626500	1627500	Sure.
1627500	1628500	And they're great guys.
1628500	1632060	For those that don't know, Dance Summit is bust a move slash groove three.
1632060	1633060	Yeah, essentially.
1633060	1634060	Basically, yeah.
1634060	1636780	It's like the multi-player team dance.
1636780	1637780	Yep.
1637780	1644460	Um, and then, um, Dan bought Shantae for, um, uh, Wii U.
1644460	1645460	Oh, random!
1645460	1652780	And, well, Wii One, I already had it on Switch, not on Switch, but on, um, Steam.
1652780	1655820	And then, um, he bought Bayonetta 2 for Wii U.
1655820	1656820	Nice.
1656820	1657820	Which comes with Bayonetta 1.
1658140	1659140	And I was like, you know, that's on Switch, right?
1659140	1660140	He's like, it is?
1660140	1661140	Yeah.
1661140	1665940	He's like, I was like, yeah, but we now have it for Wii U, so whatevs.
1665940	1670660	Well, yeah, and now that the Wii U is kind of like, I wouldn't say it's completely sunsetted
1670660	1675220	yet, but like, we're like two minutes to midnight on the Wii U here, like it's, it's pretty
1675220	1676220	much done.
1676220	1679260	And, uh, you know, that, I think it's going to be the value of things like that kind of
1679260	1680260	go up.
1680260	1681260	You know what I mean?
1681260	1682260	It's collector's items.
1682260	1685660	Well, and then I bought him something that he told me not to buy him, but I know he wanted
1685660	1689280	it and he doesn't know I bought it for him, so he's, I left it on the bottom of the stack
1689280	1690280	of games on the table.
1690280	1691280	Oh.
1691280	1697580	I bought him the Sega Aegis, uh, 2500, um, Gunstar Heroes collection that also comes
1697580	1702380	with Dynamite Headdy and, um, some other treasure game.
1702380	1708020	It's the treasure box, but I wanted to get him that so he could, and I'm trying to convince
1708020	1709020	him first.
1709020	1714900	I'm going to try to convince him first to stream Gunstar Heroes through the PS2, um,
1714900	1722020	but I'm also deciding if I think I am going to do the Halo thing, if I can get my mom's
1722020	1723900	rent paid for next month.
1723900	1729140	So, and I would have to do it from a place that's already set up to stream off Xbox.
1729140	1732840	Actually, I'm not set up for Xbox.
1732840	1737060	I don't know if there's any Halos on PC that I have, but I can check that out.
1737060	1741460	Um, but I don't actually usually, I mean, it's not hard to do the Xbox.
1741460	1748500	I'm not set up at mine too, but, um, well, if I'll talk to you off air.
1748500	1749500	You've got the mic stuff set up.
1749500	1750500	Yeah.
1750500	1753620	I was gonna say, I'll talk to you off air because there's things and reasons why Twitch
1753620	1755500	broadcasting may soon be portable.
1755500	1758820	So all right, anyway, uh, let's see.
1758820	1763480	Going to chat, uh, at live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf says, Wii U still has virtual
1763480	1764480	console.
1764480	1765480	Yes, that's true.
1765480	1766980	Uh, Wii U does have virtual console.
1766980	1769000	That's why I didn't say it's dead.
1769000	1772920	That's why I said it's more like last call.
1772920	1774160	That's a good way to put it.
1774160	1778560	As far as we use concern last call, uh, act def says you can probably get master chief
1778560	1779640	collection for the Xbox one.
1779640	1780720	I have it.
1780720	1782840	My Xbox one just isn't set up for streaming.
1782840	1788000	It's probably not that hard to get it all set up, but at the same time, you know, we
1788000	1790960	don't have an Xbox one and I'm not going to have one.
1790960	1791960	I thought you guys did.
1791960	1792960	No.
1792960	1793960	Oh shoot.
1793960	1794960	Okay.
1794960	1795960	We had zero reason to buy one.
1795960	1796960	There's nothing really on it.
1796960	1797960	It's that was worthwhile to us.
1797960	1799840	Maybe 60 to stream the old halos if nothing else.
1799840	1800840	Yeah.
1800840	1801840	Okay.
1801840	1802840	So we can work something out.
1802840	1803840	All right.
1803840	1804840	Cool.
1804840	1805840	Uh, let's see.
1805840	1806840	Let's move on with our gaming weeks.
1806840	1807840	Loki.
1807840	1808840	I didn't play much this week.
1808840	1811240	I mainly played Pokemon just to and from work.
1811240	1817480	Um, I did play a few things today cause we went to fair game, which is a local retro
1817480	1818800	game store nearby.
1818800	1820840	So we played some of the arcade games there.
1820840	1826880	So, um, I played arrow fighters too for briefly cause my youngest son's like, play this game,
1826880	1827880	play this game.
1827880	1830280	Like, okay, I'll play this game.
1830280	1835640	And then my son played on a play choice 10 and he had a, he wanted to play super Mario
1835640	1837960	brothers two on that.
1837960	1838960	I'm like, okay, that's weird.
1838960	1841960	We, I'm like, we have this at home free.
1841960	1843200	I don't know why I'm gonna play this here.
1843200	1846360	Um, and they play a little bit of super Mario brothers three as well.
1846360	1849240	And apparently I'm very rusty when it comes to super Mario brothers three.
1849240	1853400	I'm like, cause I was like, stand aside, I'll show you how it's done.
1853400	1856760	And they immediately did not show them how it's done.
1856760	1860120	I was like, damn, I'm out of practice.
1860120	1861120	Did dad let them down?
1861120	1863000	I let myself down.
1863000	1864000	I was defeated.
1864000	1865000	Nice.
1865000	1867000	I had anything else?
1867000	1869240	Uh, that's it.
1869240	1871280	Just been mainly working in Unreal.
1871280	1872280	All right.
1872280	1876920	Uh, my gaming week was also not quite as, uh, fun filled as Jamie's just because, um,
1876920	1879160	again, I was focusing for a performance yesterday.
1879160	1884000	Um, but I did get to play a little bit, so, um, I'm still continuing on doing my, uh,
1884000	1886520	little gold quests every day in heroes of the storm.
1886520	1889640	So I'm still playing that, but I pretty much only do versus AI.
1889640	1894440	And I had such a terrible match last night that I, I thought it was going to be like
1894440	1898440	the first time I ever, well, maybe, I don't think it's the first time, but like the first
1898440	1902280	time in like a year that I've actually lost the versus AI mode.
1902280	1906000	Like I would have been so upset, but we pulled it through in the very end, but I was getting
1906000	1907000	worried.
1907000	1910680	Uh, for those that play heroes of the storm, it was the black hearts bay and somehow the
1910680	1915840	enemy team actually got like two or three turn ins on the cannons, which, you know,
1915840	1917720	in versus AI, like never happens.
1917720	1920840	So anyway, it was very frustrating, but we did it.
1920840	1921960	Uh, let's see.
1921960	1926280	I've been playing a lot of Lucio in that game because of, uh, the, just the quests I've
1926280	1927280	been getting.
1927280	1931840	I got like, when as a support hero, when as an overwatch hero, then again, when as a support
1931840	1932840	hero.
1932840	1936840	So I've just been playing quite a bit of a Lucio with that, um, who makes a fun character
1936840	1937840	in heroes of the storm.
1937840	1940040	I like, I like some of the overwatch crossover stuff.
1940080	1944240	I wonder if wrecking balls show up in a heroes of the storm, which means I did play a little
1944240	1945240	bit of overwatch.
1945240	1951080	Uh, I've been doing some random heroes have not gotten wrecking ball in random heroes.
1951080	1955480	I know he's in there cause I see him show up on the other teams, but um, I, one match
1955480	1958720	I was doing, I kept getting mercy over and over and over again, which is fine cause you
1958720	1962800	know, I can actually play mercy, but it's when I get the, it's when I get like reaper
1962800	1969160	like the two characters I just, I can't play for crap are reaper and especially tracer.
1969160	1972720	I just don't understand how to play tracer.
1972720	1977640	Like I'm trying, like I'm trying, I'm learning more about how like you kind of dart in to
1977640	1981200	hit somebody in the back line and then pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, and then rewind to get
1981200	1982200	back to where you were.
1982200	1987240	But it's, it's, I, I, I'm better at it with Sombra and I, I really liked the changes they
1987240	1993580	made with Sombra because now the little invisibility and the teleportation mechanism are infinite
1993580	1997280	amount of time except the teleportation mechanism can be destroyed, but if you hide it well
1997280	1998840	enough, that won't be a problem.
1998840	2003380	So that's what I like to do with Sombra is run in there invisible, then make myself visible
2003380	2006080	to try to get the healer in the back line or at least hack them.
2006080	2007600	So mercy can't rez or something.
2007600	2010240	And then the minute they see me, poof, teleport out of there.
2010240	2011920	So it's, it's kind of like a similar strategy.
2011920	2014840	I think I'm just better at it with Sombra than I am with tracer.
2014840	2020760	So let's see, we can hit chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2020760	2021760	Let's see.
2021760	2026480	Bonds 006 says, no, Rob, I don't want any Overwatch in my heroes of the storm.
2026480	2027480	Too late.
2027520	2034200	Like six characters from Overwatch in heroes of the storm, like Ana, Lucio, Zarya, Junkrat,
2034200	2040520	Hanzo, like, and I really enjoy playing Hanzo in heroes of the storm, but I would say he's,
2040520	2044440	he's probably the third character I get pissed off when I get in random heroes in Overwatch.
2044440	2047920	Cause I don't like playing with him either.
2047920	2048920	But oddly I can do Widowmaker.
2048920	2050200	I just can't do Hanzo.
2050200	2051200	It's weird.
2051200	2052920	Uh, let's see.
2052920	2055480	And then sj100matt says, I can't play tracer either.
2055480	2056480	Okay, good.
2057480	2061040	And bonds 006 says, I target all D.Va players.
2061040	2062040	She is annoying.
2062040	2069000	Uh, D.Va, yeah, D.Va's one of the few tanks that I feel like I can actually sort of play.
2069000	2070960	I feel like my best tank is Orisa.
2070960	2076980	I have yet to be able to play any tank as good as I can Orisa, but, um, yeah, I, I do
2076980	2077980	like D.Va.
2077980	2079440	D.Va's probably my second or third.
2079440	2083840	Um, oh, in heroes of the storm though, I don't like D.Va in heroes of the storm.
2083920	2087320	I don't think, she, she doesn't really work the same way in heroes of the storm.
2087320	2089080	I don't like her in that game.
2089080	2094560	Um, it's just not the same, so, um, but I've seen other people use her well, I'm just not
2094560	2095560	good with her.
2095560	2099320	Anyway, other stuff I played this week, uh, Pokemon Go as well, of course, I'm always
2099320	2100320	playing that.
2100320	2103480	Uh, and I think I mentioned the level 16 in Ingress, I mentioned that last show, right?
2103480	2104480	Cause I think it was last Friday.
2104480	2105480	Okay.
2105480	2106600	Uh, but I'm still playing it.
2106600	2107600	I didn't stop.
2107600	2111960	Uh, and I know they had a big, big Ingress thing, like all the, uh, people that you heard
2111960	2113200	on the show back in January.
2113200	2116480	They were all in San Diego cause they had the big live event in San Diego this weekend.
2116480	2118840	Oh, I got a little pop up when I opened Ingress today.
2118840	2123000	Yeah, and I, I couldn't, because of Clue again, I couldn't do anything.
2123000	2128560	You know, sometimes I do behind the scenes support, but I couldn't do it even for this.
2128560	2132840	So uh, but I'm glad to hear they did, my team did really well, so it was very happy to hear
2132840	2133840	it.
2133840	2138180	Um, anyway, um, other stuff that I did play, No Man's Sky next.
2138180	2141280	So I went back to No Man's Sky this week as I imagine a lot of you did.
2141280	2144760	Uh, and if you own the game and you haven't gone back, you really should.
2144760	2146400	I mean, because it's not going to cost you anything.
2146400	2148080	This is not pay content.
2148080	2153240	This is them trying to Diablo 3 or Final Fantasy 14 their game.
2153240	2157240	They're trying to bring it back from a game that was very broken and well, I don't know.
2157240	2158900	I said, let me dial it back.
2158900	2163500	I don't think No Man's Sky was ever like super broken, but clearly it was not the fully realized
2163500	2167240	game that they were hyping up or that they really wanted it to be.
2167240	2171180	So they were doing these patches for a little while and then they've kind of been silent
2171180	2174640	for about nine months while they've been working on this big patch.
2174640	2180140	So they put out this big patch and now you can do a multiplayer, uh, Dark Soccer.
2180140	2181140	You might be interested in this.
2181140	2183500	The default view now is third person.
2183500	2186180	So No Man's Sky is no longer exclusively a first person thing.
2186180	2189380	You can play in third person because I know you've talked about on the show before your
2189380	2193500	motion sickness where you way prefer a third person view because you can do that better.
2193500	2196620	If I didn't have so many things on my list, I would go for it.
2196620	2197620	Yeah.
2197620	2199260	I think, I think you would get a kick out of No Man's Sky actually.
2199260	2200260	I don't know.
2200260	2201260	I don't know.
2201260	2202260	It's hard to say.
2202260	2203820	Sometimes I, I have a hard time judging your tastes.
2203820	2208940	I would have never guessed that you would have become as obsessed with like Dragon Age
2208940	2210540	and Mass Effect as you did.
2210540	2211540	You know what I mean?
2211540	2212540	They're fine.
2212540	2216020	Yeah, no, I, I, I, but it's mostly because of good character development.
2216020	2217620	Yeah, no, they do have a great story.
2217620	2218620	They really do.
2218620	2223220	Um, so anyway, um, but unfortunately No Man's Sky doesn't really have story.
2223220	2225540	Um, it's more of like a sandbox type of thing.
2225540	2230980	I mean, there is a story, but you know, technically there's a story in Minecraft too.
2230980	2231980	You know what I mean?
2231980	2232980	So anyway.
2232980	2234940	Um, but I, I, yeah, I'm enjoying the updates.
2234940	2239180	I was doing some live streams, uh, over on my Twitch channel, Rob Roberts on Twitch.
2239180	2244380	And uh, I was doing some streams and, uh, when I was playing one of them, Bobby Blackwolf,
2244380	2247940	uh, from also from VOG ended up joining my game.
2247940	2250160	And so he was able to come to my planet.
2250160	2253980	So in my solar system, I started on a really crappy planet and I think that's what this
2253980	2254980	game is doing now.
2254980	2258820	I think it starts you on a crappy planet on purpose so that you have to learn real quick
2258820	2260860	about the basic techniques for survival.
2260860	2264020	But the good news is they put in like these quick access menu that make it really easy
2264020	2268660	to like feed yourself the oxygen and the, um, sodium and the stuff that you need to
2268660	2270540	kind of like for basic life support.
2270540	2273740	You can feed that really easy as opposed to like having to like open up the menu going
2273740	2274740	to this.
2274740	2275740	It was really cumbersome before.
2275740	2277180	Um, so they made that really easy.
2277180	2281140	So you learn how to survive really quick, which I actually, even though it was kind
2281140	2285300	of scary and annoying, I think it taught me the game better by doing that.
2285300	2287300	So anyway, I went to another planet.
2287300	2288300	It was also very toxic.
2288300	2292980	But the third planet I went to, I touched down and the little planet scan shows up and
2292980	2300100	it's like sentinels, not very aggressive, um, animal life, peaceful, uh, weather blissful.
2300100	2304700	And everything was like, it was like, this planet is like a casuals dream, right?
2304700	2308020	There's like nothing going on in this planet and it's a beautiful planet.
2308020	2311300	So I named it because I remember blissful was the term that stuck out of my mind.
2311300	2313380	I named the planet Blissey.
2313380	2318020	So there's this planet called Blissey in a universe that Bobby ended up naming Voglandia.
2318020	2319900	So there's the planet Blissey.
2319900	2323340	And so Bobby kind of like moved in on that planet.
2323340	2327460	So I created a base and apparently since I stopped, I have not logged in since I made
2327460	2328460	that base.
2328460	2331180	Apparently he made a base across the lake as well.
2331180	2334220	So he's kind of moved in on that planet and I know Dungeon Buster showed up.
2334220	2335220	My friend Neil showed up.
2335220	2338620	I don't know if they made bases too, but I know like people have been converging on planet
2338620	2343200	Blissey as kind of like, and that's kind of cool because we were able to do multiplayer.
2343200	2347620	And so I was running around with Bobby and we were trying to find the only downside to
2347620	2349720	Blissey that we kind of have learned.
2349720	2351320	There's like no caves.
2351320	2352860	There is no natural cave system.
2352860	2356100	And even if you try to make your own caves, like we're not finding anything like the planet
2356100	2357660	is very flat.
2357660	2361520	So we're not finding the resources we need that are usually underground.
2361520	2365100	So but we were trying to run around looking for him and I would keep getting distracted
2365100	2368580	and be like, Bobby, look at this tower over here and we'd be on our jet packs like flying
2368580	2369580	over there.
2369580	2370580	And that was kind of cool.
2370580	2372120	Like that we could go like explore that together.
2372120	2377260	And I didn't realize I think how cool of a feature that was and maybe why people wanted
2377260	2381740	that so bad in the beginning until I kind of experienced that and then experience that
2381740	2385460	we would get to the tower and then Bobby would take the item in the tower before I could
2385460	2386460	get to it.
2386460	2391580	So that was a whole experience that I didn't get in the original No Man's Sky, but it was
2391580	2392580	fun.
2392580	2393580	It was good.
2393580	2395940	It's like it's 25 bucks for PS4.
2395940	2396940	Yeah.
2396940	2401540	Um, I think it's been having like a half off sales since I didn't already, you know, spend
2401540	2403180	a hundred bucks on video games this weekend.
2403180	2404180	I know.
2404180	2405180	I hear you.
2405180	2408780	I feel the fine cheap use too because I'm sure a lot of people just said, ah, fuck this.
2408780	2410060	And yeah, it might still be out there.
2410060	2411060	Use it.
2411060	2412060	Might be harder to find now.
2412060	2413060	So that people are scooping it up because of the update.
2413060	2414840	I'm for 25 bucks for the prime.
2414840	2418940	I should say though, yeah, Bobby and I are on the PS4 version of the game just because
2418940	2420580	that's, I thought I doubled it.
2420580	2422660	I thought I did get it on PC at one point.
2422660	2426300	I swear I double dipped and got it on PC, but I don't have it on my computer.
2426300	2427300	I searched everything.
2427300	2430100	It's not my steam library and I don't think I would have bought it on GOG.
2430100	2431340	In fact, I looked on GOG.
2431340	2433140	It wasn't there and I don't think I bought it anywhere else.
2433140	2434540	GOG's not getting the update until later.
2434540	2436100	Yeah, I heard about the GOG stuff.
2436100	2440260	So, but did you hear that GOG was willing to like refund anybody on that game?
2440260	2441260	Oh yeah.
2441260	2444640	GOG came out and was like, if you're unhappy about this, we tried to work with the developer.
2444640	2445960	You can refund the game basically.
2445960	2447980	So I thought that was, you know, good man GOG.
2447980	2448980	Woo.
2448980	2449980	Yeah.
2449980	2450980	Okay.
2450980	2452980	Um, I thought I had it on PC, but I don't.
2452980	2454300	Alan has it on PC.
2454300	2458540	So I think what happened is that when our steam libraries would still talk to each other,
2458540	2462060	because that stopped working a long time ago, I think I might've used his copy of No Man's
2462060	2463060	Sky at one point.
2463060	2465700	And I think that's why I remember playing it on PC.
2465700	2470500	But anyway, Dungeon Buster says I found a cave on my second visit.
2470500	2471500	Oh my gosh.
2471500	2472500	I didn't know that.
2472500	2473500	Planet Blissey has caves that are just really far apart.
2473500	2474620	Oh, that's good to know.
2474620	2477860	You have to mark that somehow so we can find it, Dungeon Buster.
2477860	2480580	Bobby Blackwool says it only happened once.
2480580	2484580	I never did it again yet in regards to us stealing from me.
2484580	2488720	Uh, anyway, so yeah, if you, if you owned No Man's Sky at some point, you really should
2488720	2489720	check it out again.
2489720	2497620	I think it's worth 25 bucks, 60 bucks, 30 on steam, 60 bucks, 30 is a good price too.
2497620	2498620	60.
2498620	2499620	I don't know.
2499620	2502340	It would really depend on how you feel about the genre.
2502340	2506980	Like if you know what you're getting into, you like sandbox games.
2506980	2512100	This is, you know, don't be like the people that got all pissed off when they bought this
2512100	2515460	game the first time because they didn't really know what they were getting into.
2515460	2516460	You know what I mean?
2516460	2517460	And I just bought it.
2517460	2518460	Did you really?
2518460	2519460	It was half price.
2519460	2521460	Oh, but you have it on PC.
2521460	2522460	No, no.
2522460	2523460	I have it on PC.
2523460	2525980	So, oh, but sadly you can't play with us cause you're on PC.
2525980	2526980	But that's okay.
2526980	2528200	Well then I'll refund it.
2528200	2529460	I'll probably double dip.
2529460	2530900	Well, you should still play.
2530900	2532180	I think you'd like it.
2532180	2533820	Alan's on PC.
2533820	2535180	You should get him to play.
2535180	2536180	So anyway.
2536180	2537180	Alright.
2537180	2544140	If there's anyone else on PC, you should meet up with Dark Sakura.
2544140	2545140	Let's see.
2545140	2547220	Oh, they're talking about Pokemon.
2547220	2551900	I'm like, the planet, like any Blissey, is 365 hit points and a pain in the ass to take
2551900	2552900	down.
2552900	2553900	There you go.
2553900	2554900	Brad from Pod Culture's on PC.
2554900	2556940	So I'm sure there's some people also on PC.
2556940	2560980	I wish they would speak to each other, but we know how Sony is with cross play right
2560980	2563100	now and it makes me very cross.
2563100	2564100	Anyway.
2564320	2566180	There you go with our gaming weeks.
2566180	2567580	Some quick announcements.
2567580	2573160	There will be no show the weekend of August, I'm trying to remember off the top of my head
2573160	2574160	or does it have been September?
2574160	2576060	No, it'll be September 2nd at that point.
2576060	2581020	There'll be no show September 2nd because I will be at Dragon Con and I'm very excited
2581020	2582020	about that.
2582020	2586540	I had a great time at Dragon Con last year and the last what, six years I've been.
2586540	2588920	So excited for Dragon Con this year.
2588920	2593300	Hoping to be able to tell you guys very soon about some panels I'll be working with and
2593300	2594500	I hope to see you guys there.
2594500	2596700	But there will be no show Labor Day weekend, September 2nd.
2596700	2597700	I'll be at Sleep Con.
2597700	2598700	You'll be at Sleep Con?
2598700	2599700	Nap Con?
2599700	2600700	Nap Con.
2600700	2601700	Sounds like fun.
2601700	2604020	Well, with a nice long weekend, you guys can do, you know, other stuff too.
2604020	2607140	So what didn't you, weren't you saying you might hit up SAC Anime because I know that's
2607140	2608140	that same weekend.
2608140	2609140	So.
2609140	2610140	Not this SAC Anime.
2610140	2611140	I'm planning on January.
2611140	2612140	Gotcha.
2612140	2613140	Gotcha.
2613140	2615060	I'm going to redo my Jill Valentine costume.
2615060	2616060	Oh, fun.
2616060	2617060	Good times.
2617060	2618900	Don't end up a Jill sandwich.
2618900	2619900	All right.
2619900	2621660	Let's get into some gaming news.
2621700	2624300	Loki, what, what else happened in games this week?
2624300	2625300	All right.
2625300	2629860	So this week, uh, we had Nintendo suing pirates.
2629860	2630860	Yeah.
2630860	2636500	I'm surprised it's taken so long to do that, but, um, apparently they have filed lawsuits
2636500	2643380	against two ROM sites, one called Love ROMs and the other one LoveRetro.co, which are
2643380	2651140	both operated by some guy named Jacob Matthias and are built entirely on the brazen and mass
2651180	2655420	scale infringement and Nintendo's intellectual property rights.
2655420	2659820	I've never heard of these sites and I know I don't use these sites for getting ROMs,
2659820	2663220	so I'm kind of surprised that this is who they targeted first.
2663220	2668260	I think one of these sites, maybe both of them, the big difference that I noticed that
2668260	2673100	probably made them a target was the fact that you could play the games right there in the
2673100	2676580	browser, like the emulator and the game were both together.
2676580	2677580	It was like an in-browser emulator.
2677580	2680580	I've been looking at, has the same thing.
2680580	2681580	No, I know.
2681580	2682580	I know.
2682580	2683580	Please.
2683580	2684580	It's like porn.
2684580	2685580	There's ROM sites everywhere.
2685580	2690580	So, you know, this is clearly some type of scare move by Nintendo.
2690580	2691580	I don't know.
2691580	2696500	It's weird because look, I, I don't want to say like, like the reality is when you get
2696500	2701820	into this whole business with ROMs, you are getting into this real gray area when it comes
2701820	2702820	to legality.
2702820	2704640	You're just going to push it underground more.
2704640	2706800	It's just going to go into torrents instead.
2706800	2709940	You're just going to have to download the whole ROM sets instead.
2709940	2713020	And they're not solving any problem.
2713020	2715500	They're just kind of sweeping it under the rug basically.
2715500	2719220	It's like, Oh yeah, you're not going to eliminate piracy of your ROMs on the internet.
2719220	2722980	And what's the point even cause you don't have your fucking virtual console anymore.
2722980	2724560	Well on they're gearing up for that.
2724560	2725560	We know that.
2725560	2726560	Right.
2726560	2730380	I'm gearing up for that announcement any day now.
2730380	2731980	What's it, when's it coming out again?
2731980	2736260	How many weeks do we have for them to make that fucking announcement?
2736260	2738020	So here's the problem.
2738020	2739940	It's the year 2018.
2739940	2741300	Okay.
2741300	2747300	I know I have been using ROMs and NES emulators since I was in college in 1998.
2747300	2750040	So like those things have been around for at least 20 years.
2750040	2752740	And I know Nintendo has enforced some of this in the past.
2752740	2753740	It's fine.
2753740	2757820	But it just seems a little weird where it's like, why now all of a sudden, and as much
2757820	2763100	as you're sassing what I'm saying here, I do think a part of it is because Nintendo
2763100	2769060	is about to unleash Switch's version of the retro gaming, whatever it is.
2769060	2772460	And so they're setting an example, they're making an example of these to try to scare
2772460	2773980	other people off from it.
2773980	2775020	But I don't necessarily disagree.
2775020	2779280	And I don't want to come off as, Oh, I completely like, I get it.
2779280	2781180	This is like a legal gray area.
2781180	2782600	It's not even really a gray area.
2782600	2786260	Like you are like, you're not supposed to be doing this now where I think it is a gray
2786260	2792780	area is well, but if I bought these games, you know, but cause you know, with, with the
2792780	2798140	patent having expired on the Nintendo hardware technology, something like a retron five,
2798140	2800140	which is completely legal to loan.
2800140	2801140	What is that doing?
2801140	2805140	It's dumping your cartridges to a PC format and emulating there on the spot, right?
2805140	2809620	So I mean like with stuff I already own, it shouldn't be as big of an issue.
2809620	2812420	And I understand, and I'm sure there's going to be those who want to play devil's advocate
2812420	2813420	and shadow.
2813420	2814420	Like, no, that's still legal.
2814420	2815420	But look, I get it.
2815420	2816420	I get it.
2816420	2817820	But I don't know.
2817820	2820660	There's also something about kind of like what you were alluding to where it's like,
2820660	2827060	how much money is Nintendo really losing on this whole thing?
2827060	2829980	Especially for people that just want to play games that they already own.
2829980	2836020	Probably less money than they spent on lawyers for this.
2836020	2837020	It's hard to tell.
2837020	2838020	I don't know.
2838020	2843420	Like when it comes to emulating games, I find also that nothing really beats the real thing.
2843420	2844700	Um, no, granted.
2844700	2846420	I like the classic NES.
2846420	2847540	I like the virtual console.
2847540	2850380	I realize those are emulated, but nothing really beats the real thing.
2851100	2856380	I've downloaded the whole Nintendo ROM set like dozens of times, and I still buy their
2856380	2858500	shit on virtual console.
2858500	2863860	The only person that's keeping money out of Nintendo's pockets right now is Nintendo.
2863860	2869340	Because you're not providing me a way to give you money for the game that I want.
2869340	2873460	So why are you going out through these ROM sites?
2873460	2877420	It's not like you, hey, put out the virtual console and nothing's selling because everybody's
2877420	2879260	just downloading ROMs for free.
2879260	2880260	That's not what's fucking happening.
2880260	2885220	What's fucking happening is you're not selling the games in the first place.
2885220	2887260	I can't give you the money, Nintendo.
2887260	2890100	Why do you hate money so much?
2890100	2894780	Do you think part of it has to do with the classic NES hacking?
2894780	2895780	Just throwing it out there?
2895780	2900860	They should have fixed it when either the Super NES came out or when they re-released
2900860	2901860	the NES.
2901860	2904020	They could have fixed that shit, but they didn't.
2904020	2905860	Well, but let's be real, Loki.
2905860	2907340	A, we all know hackers gonna hack.
2907340	2908340	They're never gonna fix them.
2908340	2912700	B, if those things are running on Linux, that's especially so, that they were never gonna
2912700	2914020	fix those things.
2914020	2918300	As long as they were running Linux, people were always going to be able to backdoor their
2918300	2920900	way into those things and put whatever they want on them.
2920900	2924100	Which interestingly enough, I still haven't done with my classic NES.
2924100	2926220	I haven't decided if that's something I want to do or not.
2926220	2927220	You should.
2927220	2928220	It's super easy.
2928220	2929220	I know.
2929220	2930220	I know.
2930220	2931220	But I don't know.
2931220	2933340	Part of me kind of likes that it's as like a collectible.
2933340	2934340	It's untouched.
2934340	2935340	It's the way it is.
2935760	2939740	If I want to play any of that other stuff, I have it all on PC because I got it years
2939740	2940740	ago.
2940740	2941740	You know what I mean?
2941740	2946460	But I don't find that I, I guess I don't find that I play a lot of that stuff on PC.
2946460	2950260	Like when I go through my emulator collection on PC, I'll play something for like five minutes
2950260	2951880	and I'll be like, cool, next.
2951880	2956060	You know, I don't really play those games as like start to finish.
2956060	2959220	Like the NES controller to actually play stuff.
2959220	2960220	True.
2960220	2961220	True.
2961220	2964060	You could just hack it and you wouldn't even notice it.
2964060	2966820	You just, you just push in guardian legend.
2966820	2969940	You wouldn't even notice that anything's different.
2969940	2973340	It would be all, it looks exactly the same.
2973340	2976340	You just, it's just, now you have guardian legend in there.
2976340	2980380	Uh, bonds, double 06 and chat says, Rob wants to keep his collection of Virgin for as long
2980380	2981380	as possible.
2981380	2982540	Keep it pure Rob.
2982540	2983540	That's right.
2983540	2990300	I don't want, I don't want your dirty internet hands touching, touching my daughter.
2990300	2998700	Uh, Brad from pod culture also says it's a super easy to, I guess, hack those things.
2998700	3004500	So Brad from pod culture suggests you sneak in and hack it while I'm away at dragon con.
3004500	3007660	Now that's mean no touching my stuff while I'm not here.
3007660	3012060	Maybe I'm going to now, now Brad, I'm going to take my classic NES to pod culture.
3012060	3014940	I'm going to say if I take it to him, he'll hack it.
3014940	3018900	I'm going to take my classic NES to dragon con because it is small enough to fit in that
3018900	3019900	thing.
3019900	3020900	Just so look, you can't touch it.
3020900	3028620	I'm not driving over here to hack that thing is not a thing that is on any sort of priority.
3028620	3032980	All right, let's move on and talk about, uh, changes and other change in gaming.
3032980	3036940	And this kind of has to do with something that's been an argument, I guess for the past
3036940	3037940	year or so.
3037940	3039500	And that has to do with loot boxes.
3039500	3045420	Well, uh, turn 10, the developer of forza, motorsport seven has announced that prize
3045420	3049560	crates will be being removed from forza motorsports seven.
3049560	3051420	This is a game that is already out.
3051420	3056940	Uh, they're going to take out the prize crates, uh, for now, uh, right now, cars are completely
3056940	3058540	out of the prize crates.
3058540	3061020	There are no competitive advantage to them.
3061020	3066140	There are now only cosmetic items like driver gear and badges and mods that can increase
3066140	3067580	rewards in single player.
3067580	3070940	There used to be cars that were exclusive in prize crates.
3070940	3072580	Those can now be bought normally.
3072580	3075980	Um, what's interesting though, I think what makes this a little bit different is that
3075980	3081860	the price crates, uh, were never on sale for real money in the games marketplace.
3081860	3087140	It looked like it was all set up for that, but something stopped them from turning that
3087140	3088140	on.
3088140	3090660	I wonder what that could have been at the end of last year when forza motorsport came
3090660	3091660	out.
3091660	3096060	I don't know, but they never turned on selling these things for real money.
3096060	3099260	So instead I'm assuming the price crates are must be things that you can like kind of win
3099260	3100260	from in game.
3100260	3101260	Here's what you have to do.
3101260	3102620	You have to look at one thing.
3102620	3104340	One, is your game free to play?
3104340	3108140	No, then get that shit out of that fucking game.
3108140	3109980	All right.
3109980	3114340	Uh, so, um, they're going to step further though now that they, even though they're
3114340	3118020	not selling these things anymore, uh, they are just getting rid of them.
3118020	3124140	Also, uh, paid tokens will not be in forza motorsport seven or horizon four.
3124140	3129100	Uh, so even if you don't play the mainline forza games, maybe you play the, uh, horizon
3129100	3133380	spin off games for coming out again, October, I know I'm excited too.
3133380	3138840	I'm really excited about that to register participation for this week's episode of orange
3138840	3144140	on radio at vog network.com use the passphrase side.
3144140	3149860	So um, yeah, forza horizon four will be coming out in October and uh, these will not be a
3149860	3150860	part of that.
3150860	3156980	So they're, they're learning their loot box lesson now so that forza horizon can be pure.
3156980	3157980	Isn't that nice?
3157980	3158980	Very refreshing.
3158980	3159980	Good for doing the right thing.
3159980	3162980	I'm not patting you on the back though for it because you should have fucking been doing
3162980	3163980	this all along.
3163980	3168700	Uh, Bobby in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com confirms it's October 2nd is the day it comes
3168700	3169700	out.
3169700	3170700	That's even.
3170700	3171700	Hooray.
3171700	3172700	Hooray.
3172700	3173700	I love me.
3173700	3174700	So we're still disappointed by Nintendo's announcement.
3174700	3175700	We still have horizon four.
3175700	3176700	That's right.
3176700	3178300	There's still something to look forward to.
3178300	3181780	Someone's got our back on the horizon.
3181780	3184560	I'm not, I'm not even going to.
3184560	3187020	Next up on the horizon, dark Sakura.
3187060	3191820	Well, there are going to be some new arcade cabinets released for old games.
3191820	3197720	They um, are from arcade one up and they will have different games featured for each package.
3197720	3200940	There's going to be a centipede cabinet that has centipede millipede missile command and
3200940	3201940	crystal castles.
3201940	3207580	So I guess all the track ball games, um, an asteroids cabinet that has asteroids, tempest,
3207580	3213500	major havoc and lunar Lander, uh, then one with rampage defender, joust and gauntlet.
3213500	3218420	And then a street fighter two championship cabinet, which is a street fighter two championship
3218420	3223180	edition super street fighter two new challengers and super street fighter two turbo.
3223180	3227440	And then the final fight cabinet, which is final fight 1944, the loop master ghosts and
3227440	3229020	goblins and Strider.
3229020	3237500	Um, they're about 400 a pop and they are three quarter size of the original cabinets and
3237500	3241180	it will come with a cabinet riser and a potential stool.
3241180	3242180	He needed to build them.
3242340	3244660	They're like Ikea for arcade cabinets.
3244660	3245660	Yeah.
3245660	3246660	I mean, it's like a lot of furniture.
3246660	3247660	Pretty good.
3247660	3248660	Yeah.
3248660	3249660	So I mentioned they're kind of like this.
3249660	3251700	I mean, I, sorry you guys, it's a radio show, but I imagine they're kind of like this thing
3251700	3253700	that we have in studio, which was at Loki's old work.
3253700	3255700	I mentioned they're kind of like that.
3255700	3257580	That's a bar top cabinet though.
3257580	3258580	It's an actual standup.
3258580	3261700	Have you seen the smaller cabinets that they have at California extreme?
3261700	3262700	I actually haven't.
3262700	3265100	They look like they're for small teenagers.
3265100	3266100	Yeah.
3266100	3267100	That's about the size.
3267100	3268100	Interesting.
3268100	3269100	Okay.
3269220	3271980	Probably about five foot.
3271980	3272980	Yeah.
3272980	3273980	I don't know.
3273980	3277220	Like I would almost be interested in getting one, but the price is a little high.
3277220	3284180	You know, it's hard to justify when I know our cabinet, I don't think that's with a 17
3284180	3285180	inch LCD monitor.
3285180	3286180	Yeah, that's true.
3286180	3288700	And that's the monitor that probably makes the price so high.
3288700	3289700	You know what I mean?
3289700	3290700	It's basically a television.
3290700	3296460	I don't see why it's high at all because you can to buy a full size arcade cabinet sometimes
3296460	3304020	without the monitor is still somewhere between 300 to, you know, 700 depending on the cabinet.
3304020	3305020	Yeah, I guess that's true.
3305020	3306460	And that's one game.
3306460	3310820	Maybe I'm also thinking like about space just from the perspective of, again, because this
3310820	3313920	thing is here and just in general, I really don't.
3313920	3316660	It's kind of like the same conundrum I have with pinball machines in here.
3316660	3320100	As much as I would love to own my own pinball machine, I'm like, there's no space.
3320100	3321980	Keep in mind a pinball, you're looking in the thousands.
3321980	3323220	Oh yeah, no, I know that.
3323220	3324300	I know that.
3324300	3327360	So I don't know.
3327360	3332220	It's one of those things where it's like, if I had more of that space and the desire,
3332220	3333220	I might do it.
3333220	3334220	Especially that Final Fight cabinet.
3334220	3335220	Sounds like the best one.
3335220	3336220	The one with Strider on it.
3336220	3337640	Yeah, the one with Strider on it.
3337640	3339100	That sounds like the best one for sure.
3339100	3342500	And again, I already have an Ultracade, so.
3342500	3343500	Do you kick it?
3343500	3344500	Sometimes.
3344500	3345500	Okay, good.
3345500	3346500	All right.
3346500	3348380	Well, I think it is a neat little collection thing.
3348380	3352860	It is interesting too, how like Walmart is selling these and like Walmart has been in
3352860	3354580	like the classic arcade business.
3354580	3355980	I loved your little games again.
3355980	3357060	No, that's fine.
3357060	3359480	But like, and so there's the itty bitty way.
3359480	3361480	Those are like keychain itty bitty games, right?
3361480	3362480	Or how big are those?
3362480	3363480	Well, no.
3363480	3365980	Yeah, the ones I got you were about half as tall.
3365980	3366980	Okay.
3366980	3371820	And so she's pointing at the like the $20 ones that were like the tiny little cabinets
3371820	3377420	that are out there too, with like Cuber and Asteroids and stuff.
3377420	3382660	So yeah, so it's like Walmart is like in this classic retro arcade biz, all of a sudden
3382660	3384060	it's very interesting.
3384060	3389300	So going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
3389300	3391700	Dark Tetsuya says Walmart is only $300.
3391700	3395380	I guess that's what they do is undercut everybody else.
3395380	3398620	Dark Tetsuya says, I think they're a little bit bigger than the bar top.
3398620	3400720	The risers are supposed to help.
3400720	3404000	These will work right out of the box after you put them together.
3404000	3408460	Getting a cabinet off Craigslist, you might get a mostly working machine.
3408460	3412820	It is, I will say though, it is still my dream someday to own a baby Pac-Man machine
3412820	3416780	that is still like the thing that I want more than anything.
3416780	3421780	So all right, well, let's move on with some more news.
3421780	3422780	Loki.
3422780	3424440	All right.
3424440	3433660	So IntiCrate is actually looking at, they want to remake Zelda 2.
3433660	3438300	And you may remember them from such wonderful games on the Nintendo platforms, like Blaster
3438300	3445180	Master Zero, or they also had, oh yeah, they also did the bloodsitting curse of the moon
3445180	3446820	thing that was on there in Mighty Gunvel.
3446820	3449340	So they did Mighty No. 9 too.
3449340	3455500	Yeah, it was, yeah, unfortunately it's okay, but everything else is good.
3455500	3456500	So that's fine.
3456500	3461980	But apparently, you know, saying that, yeah, he would love to make it a new adventure of
3461980	3464220	Link for the modern era.
3465220	3468220	One that doesn't play like crap.
3468220	3470220	Uh, yeah, hopefully.
3470220	3472220	I'm sorry, I don't like Zelda 2.
3472220	3474220	Dan really likes it though.
3474220	3480220	But I'd be cool like with a game that didn't suck that was that style, like a, I don't
3480220	3481220	know.
3481220	3483260	I like Zelda 2.
3483260	3484260	I get it's different.
3484260	3485940	I get why it puts people off.
3485940	3489460	I totally get why it puts people off, but I really like it for what it is.
3489460	3493620	And I would so be on board with IntiCrate's getting it, but I just don't think, Nintendo
3493620	3498820	is, well, I'm about to say Nintendo is never going to let another company touch one of
3498820	3500260	their biggest properties.
3500260	3505020	But as those words leave my mouth, I then remember Metroid Other M. I then remember,
3505020	3508180	well, heck that, uh, latest Metroid game, you know?
3508180	3512860	So like it's, it's not like it's that uncommon, but it's just like Nintendo letting someone
3512860	3515140	else make a Zelda.
3515140	3516700	I don't know about that.
3516700	3517700	I know.
3517700	3520200	I'm just like, oh, I would love to see it.
3520200	3523840	Didn't Capcom help with like one of the four swords adventures or something like that?
3523840	3530480	Or I thought that like they had other, they've had third parties do things, but I think it
3530480	3534000	was reaching out to the third parties for that.
3534000	3535000	Reach out.
3535000	3539320	It's not like, you know, more Zelda games would be a terrible thing.
3539320	3543720	Well, I just want to see what IntiCrate's is going to be working on next because I think
3543720	3545040	they they've been doing some great stuff.
3545040	3546640	Obviously I love that Blaster Master Zero.
3546640	3550920	That was a great, you know, especially because I was worried about Blaster Master because
3550920	3553320	you know, some of the other reimaginings have not been so great.
3553320	3554920	I think they really did a good job with that one.
3554920	3559080	So I'm, uh, I, you know what, if they want to try their hand at Zelda two, what's the
3559080	3560200	worst that could happen?
3560200	3565080	It can't possibly be as bad as Zelda, um, 3D Oh,
3565080	3566080	exactly.
3566080	3567080	I know that.
3567080	3569800	Listen, that was a long time ago.
3569800	3573280	I think you learned your lesson with, you know, licensing that out to third parties
3573280	3580000	on other systems and also movie licensing rights, but it's a different, it's a different
3580000	3581000	decade now.
3581000	3585080	I mean, we can put that all behind us and try again.
3585080	3586080	It's a new decade.
3586080	3588080	Let's come together and try to do this again.
3588080	3589080	All right.
3589080	3595080	Well, uh, also for a new decade, uh, we are having, uh, a, I think a kind of a popular
3595080	3599160	music game from, from some people, for some people, I don't know if everybody's ever experienced
3599160	3605080	this game, but it's a game called Taiko no Tatsujin, uh, this is, uh, was once released
3605080	3609640	here in the States as Taiko Drum Master, um, because that's what it, that's what Taiko
3609640	3610640	no Tatsujin means.
3610640	3614360	Um, but this, I think it was released on the Wii, I want to say, as Taiko Drum Masters.
3614360	3615360	That sound right, you guys?
3615360	3616360	I think so.
3616360	3621640	Uh, well, it's going to be coming out again, uh, Taiko no Tatsujin, Drum Session and Taiko
3621640	3626560	no Tatsujin, Drum and Fun, uh, they're going to come out for PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
3626600	3629280	And, uh, I think one is for PS4, the other's Nintendo Switch.
3629280	3632440	They're going to come out actually in Western and European territories.
3632440	3636320	So we're going to get a localized release of these games on November 2nd.
3636320	3637320	And that's pretty cool.
3637320	3640720	Um, there's a whole little post on the PlayStation blog about it.
3640720	3644520	Uh, they're going to bring in some songs from, uh, some things you might've heard of like
3644520	3650640	Neon Genesis Evangelion, uh, Vocaloid Producers, I'm assuming that means Masunomiku, uh, Disney
3650640	3654040	Favorites from Zootopia and Frozen.
3654200	3657960	Although if Let It Go is one of the songs, I will probably put a hole in my drum.
3657960	3659360	So I don't know about that.
3659360	3664440	Um, but anyway, also songs from other Namco properties like Tekken, the Tales series,
3664440	3668120	Idolmaster, you know, what's missing from that list?
3668120	3674680	Katamari Damacy, just saying, anyway, the PS4 has ranked mode and there will be motion
3674680	3677020	controls in the Nintendo Switch version.
3677020	3682740	Although honestly, if there is not a physical drum, don't do it because, uh, the whole like
3682740	3687100	waving the Wiimotes around, I realize we're in like HD motion detection now and this stuff,
3687100	3688700	it's just, it's not going to be the same.
3688700	3691340	It's not going to be the same if it's not a tangible drum.
3691340	3696420	Anyway, uh, no word on if the controller peripheral is coming out in the West.
3696420	3700980	So if there's no official controller, you may just have to play this on PlayStation
3700980	3704260	4, like with X's and O's and that, I don't know if that would be the same.
3704260	3709020	Anyway, apparently Bandai Namco did confirm later in the week, there is no set plan to
3709020	3711540	bring that drum controller to North America.
3711540	3716260	I don't know guys, that kind of loses a lot of it for me.
3716260	3722140	Anyway, it will have a physical release in America on both PS4 and Switch, digital only
3722140	3723140	in Europe.
3723140	3726020	So it will not, although you'll get a localized version, you'll only be able to get it on
3726020	3732320	the store, uh, which is, I mean, kind of like how they released a DJ Max on PS4 over here.
3732320	3733820	So there you go.
3733820	3738020	Anyway, let's move on to a different sort of story, but something a little more positive.
3738020	3739020	Right, Darsakra?
3739700	3746220	There was a study that was conducted at Harvard Medical School in 2017 that was released that
3746220	3752820	talks about how loneliness can be more detrimental to your health than smoking would be.
3752820	3758780	And talked about increasing the relationships through your friends and family members through
3758780	3759780	games.
3759780	3763780	And it was even saying that video games contribute to that as well.
3763780	3769980	They also found out that the games have the ability to change your brain structurally
3769980	3772380	and functionally.
3772380	3777660	It can promote neurogenesis, which is the growth of new neurons, and neuroplasticity,
3777660	3782180	which is the change in neural pathways and synapses.
3782180	3785420	Basically it keeps your brain alert and functioning well.
3785420	3790700	There are also showing in another study in 2017 that was published in frontiers in human
3790700	3801020	neuroscience that gamers who got together to play games like Baduke or Go had an increase
3801020	3803580	in their gray matter.
3803580	3813180	And a decrease in the, I'm going to mispronounce this, amygdala, which I guess is a good thing.
3813180	3817740	But basically the gray matter increase in the nucleus acumen leads to more positive
3817740	3820460	experiences and enthusiasm.
3820460	3825780	The decrease in gray matter in the amygdala leads to stress reduction and an increased
3825780	3826780	calmness.
3826780	3833100	But also, especially with action video games, they found that it increased your gray matter
3833100	3839780	and functional connectivity in other regions of the brain.
3839780	3845260	Especially into the cerebral cortex, which is responsible for self-awareness and present
3845260	3847180	moments awareness.
3847180	3853420	So basically it leads to better decision making and better intuition.
3853420	3858380	Board games are really good for increasing strength in the hippocampus and the prefrontal
3858380	3865100	cortex, which usually improve cognitive functions that affect IQ, memory, and information retention
3865100	3866720	and problem solving.
3866720	3872460	So basically playing games of strategy and playing video games help increase your memory,
3872460	3883660	increase your mood for the most part, and also can functionally affect your brain biologically.
3883660	3887980	Can they make you as cool as smoking cigarettes?
3887980	3888980	Stop it now.
3888980	3889980	Stop.
3889980	3896740	Well one of the other things too is that playing collaborative games improves your computational
3896740	3904820	thinking, including skills affecting logic, distributed processing, debugging, and simulation
3904820	3906040	and algorithm building.
3906040	3914240	So basically collaborative strategy games will increase your ability to code or pick
3914240	3915240	up coding.
3915240	3922800	Yeah, you know, and I remember when I was younger.
3922800	3926720	Maybe some of these tricks we use on young children can also work on Loki, who knows?
3926720	3933280	But I remember when I was younger, when Apple IIe's and Commodore 64's were all the rage,
3933280	3934980	all the schools had Apple IIe's, right?
3934980	3937060	That was like the school computer.
3937060	3941220	And they would actually have, I don't know if it was like the Parks and Rec or if it
3941220	3942980	was like some type of summer school thing.
3942980	3948260	But I remember they would have nighttime classes on learn how to do basic programming on an
3948260	3949400	Apple IIe.
3949400	3952420	I think a lot of it, I want to say, was logo.
3952420	3956420	Now I'm sure, and not to be confused with a television network that brought us RuPaul's
3956420	3962080	Drag Race, that's something very different, but logo was a programming language, like
3962080	3966400	in the 80s, that was on Apple IIe and I think they made versions of it for other things
3966400	3967400	as well.
3967400	3969600	And it was the whole thing where you had the turtle, it was a graphics drawing program,
3969600	3970600	right?
3970600	3973280	So you would do things like, and I don't remember all the instructions, some of you guys probably
3973280	3980400	remember this better, but it was like pen down, forward 30, turn 90, and it was like
3980400	3981400	you turn the angle.
3981400	3984780	But like what you could do is you could build like, I think there was maybe like if then
3984780	3988220	or there were ways to build loops so that when you wrote a certain thing, you could
3988220	3991940	actually build like a spiral graph sort of thing where you get the turtle to turn a certain
3991940	3996160	degrees, draw a square, he would make these really pretty shapes and you could like have
3996160	3998040	it change the colors.
3998040	4001660	And so you, but that's what I did when I was like seven years old that kind of like taught
4001660	4005300	me about programming and I feel like some of that made me more smarter.
4005300	4010340	Well, here's the other good thing though about video games in particular, is that they're
4010340	4015760	actually showing that video games can help with children with dyslexia.
4015760	4025220	And also other benefits, the big thing is increased, will increase metacognition.
4025220	4031080	So basically metacognition is thinking about thinking and part of meditation.
4031080	4035960	And they were showing that for children and adults, but mostly children who would play
4035960	4042900	games and then meditate and follow these in certain cycles, actually found other increase
4042900	4053580	in not just their cognition, but in their joy in participating in things.
4053580	4059740	So really I find it very fascinating, you know, we have this camp who likes to make
4059740	4067080	video games the scapegoat for everything, but in the long run though, playing these
4067080	4072200	games are actually kind of good for you.
4072200	4074200	Who said more smarter?
4074200	4075200	I did.
4075200	4076200	I was making it funny.
4076200	4082080	I said, learning all that stuff at a young age made me more smarter.
4082080	4086800	You missed the joke because you were focused on your story.
4086800	4093020	So anyhow, but Loki's response in chat said, I know it's smarter, I should have said more
4093020	4094020	smarter.
4094020	4095020	All right.
4095020	4098260	Anyway, in all seriousness, let me get some comments in the chat.
4098260	4104860	Less dumb is legit to tell someone not to be, or to tell someone to be, like world be
4104860	4105860	less dumb.
4105860	4106860	Loki be less dumb.
4106860	4107860	All right.
4107860	4112800	Bobby Black Wolf in chat, who's not dumb at all, says the TI 85 calculator had a similar
4112800	4114540	drawing system logo.
4114540	4116320	Here's another great thing I remember from younger.
4116320	4118080	I had a friend program pole position.
4118080	4119080	Oh yeah.
4119080	4120080	You could do like mini games.
4120080	4122080	I remember there's a Tetris one floating around.
4122080	4124080	You could do assembly on that son of a bitch.
4124080	4126080	Those things were powerful little things.
4126080	4127080	Powerful little fuckers, weren't they?
4127080	4128080	Yeah, they sure were.
4128080	4129080	And yet-
4129080	4130080	And expensive.
4130080	4131080	They were expensive, especially at the time.
4131080	4132080	I could only afford an 82.
4132080	4133080	I feel like-
4133080	4139120	I have a TI 85 somewhere because I had to have it for, not chemistry, but algebra.
4139120	4140720	Do they still make TI 85s?
4140720	4141720	I feel like they probably do.
4141720	4142720	Yes, they do.
4142720	4143720	Yeah.
4143900	4146260	And they're probably like 20 bucks now when-
4146260	4147260	Nope.
4147260	4148260	Oh really?
4148260	4149260	No, they're still expensive.
4149260	4150260	Hold on.
4150260	4151260	I'll get you the price.
4151260	4152260	Really?
4152260	4153260	I would have thought maybe because of the technology and everything.
4153260	4159720	It's because they have a hold on that math market, and so it's like you pay up fuckers.
4159720	4160720	Game boy games ain't free anymore.
4160720	4161720	Okay, I take that back.
4161720	4164900	People are selling them for about 20 bucks to nine bucks on eBay.
4164900	4169300	I think that's been replaced by the TA, I want to say by a different TI because I had
4169300	4170300	a different one.
4170300	4172380	Maybe a TI 87 was the one I had?
4172380	4173380	Let me look real quick.
4174040	4179120	TI 82, and I remember I had to try to build a serial cable for it, and that was not fun.
4179120	4182720	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, TI still corners the market on graphing calculators, so I'm
4182720	4185720	sure they must have some sort of patent or something that allows them to kind of do that.
4185720	4186720	You know what I mean?
4186720	4189360	I think though, nowadays though, I'd imagine that that would be coming down because couldn't
4189360	4192360	you just download an app for your phone to do the same damn shit?
4192360	4196600	Well, okay, here's the thing, TI 84 is okay, that was the one I had in college.
4196600	4201560	The problem with it is that, and I even asked my teacher about that because the iPhone has
4201580	4207860	a graphing calculator built into it, but you can also use your iPhone for many other things,
4207860	4213380	including looking up answers and using automatic tools, so they always had us put away our
4213380	4215420	phone and bust out the graphing calculator.
4215420	4220180	I get it, so you can use a graphing calculator on a test, but you can't use a phone on a
4220180	4221180	test.
4221180	4222180	Precisely.
4222180	4223180	Or you can write down your notes on the graphing calculator.
4223180	4227260	Yeah, I was going to say, if you put pole position on a graphing calculator, you could
4227260	4228260	probably-
4228260	4229260	I'm going to put the fucking internet.
4229260	4231540	But I think the average person doesn't know how to do it.
4232520	4239200	Yeah, and right now, the TI 84 graphing calculator is about 90 bucks.
4239200	4244560	Bobby, or excuse me, it's actually Bob Coffee in chat says, it's not a patent, it's educational
4244560	4245560	contracts.
4245560	4246560	Interesting.
4246560	4250400	Isn't that how Apple got through some of its darkest years too, like pre iPhone, iTunes,
4250400	4251400	and all that?
4251400	4255080	Like it was because it's educational contracts, like the fact that they were in every school,
4255080	4259480	every institution really kind of kept on going through some of the darker years of the company.
4259480	4260720	This is crazy.
4260900	4263940	Texas Instruments stock is at $112.
4263940	4264940	Wow.
4264940	4268660	So, they're clearly doing something right.
4268660	4273180	Yeah, by not giving away tickets to movies.
4273180	4274180	Interesting.
4274180	4278340	So, Bobby points out, Apple and TI did do the same thing with educational contracts.
4278340	4282420	He also said, and he brought up the same point that we eventually got to, that they won't
4282420	4286860	let their kids have a phone out during the test, but I still programmed equations into
4286860	4287980	my TI 85.
4287980	4290260	The program was named ZZZ.
4290800	4291800	I was sneaky.
4291800	4298400	Well, Bobby Blackwell, if a true nerd would have named it ZZZT, I'm actually on the Texas
4298400	4307680	Instruments website and the TI 89 titanium, holy crap, it actually does wireframe and
4307680	4312040	you can kill a man with it.
4312040	4313960	TI 89 titanium.
4313960	4318040	That sounds like one of the weapons in the movie last night and they have a color one
4318040	4322020	now called the TI Nspire.
4322020	4323020	Oh my God.
4323020	4324420	It's just absolutely crazy.
4324420	4326060	It's got CAD built in.
4326060	4330740	You tell me what other gaming podcast devolves into a conversation on graphing calculators.
4330740	4331740	Oh, I'm sure there's plenty.
4331740	4332740	You find it.
4332740	4334740	I'm sure there's plenty.
4334740	4335740	Alright.
4335740	4339980	This week we're focusing on the Texas Instruments.
4339980	4345100	I think next year Dark Soccer should do the classic calculator of the month.
4345100	4346100	Girl.
4346100	4347100	Alright.
4347160	4348160	Alright.
4348160	4352520	This week it's Casio watch calculator.
4352520	4353520	Oh my God.
4353520	4354520	Okay.
4354520	4360360	We could fill 12 months of calculating because you, you could totally have the Casio watch.
4360360	4361640	Oh my God.
4361640	4363120	That takes me fucking back.
4363120	4364620	The Casio watch calculators.
4364620	4367520	And then I remember the one that looked like a little professor.
4367520	4368520	Do you guys know what I'm talking?
4368520	4369520	There was like a professor calculator.
4369520	4371860	It looked like a little dude with a mustache.
4371860	4372860	Somebody's got to know what I'm talking about.
4372860	4375180	This time we're doing your parents calculator.
4375180	4376180	That's right.
4376260	4377260	A rule.
4377260	4378260	An abacus.
4378260	4379260	Abacus.
4379260	4380260	Yeah.
4380260	4381760	You know what I could do though?
4381760	4382760	A speak in math.
4382760	4384760	Classic computer of the month.
4384760	4385760	Okay.
4385760	4390760	I'll start off with the IBM 486.
4390760	4391760	Alright.
4391760	4392760	I'm loving it.
4392760	4393760	Anyway.
4393760	4396760	Uh, in the meantime we got to get to some more news so we can get to the actual classic
4396760	4397760	game of the week.
4397760	4399160	But how about a new game first, Loki?
4399160	4400160	Yeah.
4400160	4401160	I'm actually kind of excited about this.
4401160	4404060	I don't really care for the labo stuff cause well, okay.
4404060	4405060	I take that back.
4405060	4409420	I care for the price of the labo stuff is what I really meant to say.
4409420	4414080	But they have a new labo set that's going to be coming out and this one's basically
4414080	4417700	about driving or vehicles or whatever.
4417700	4421860	So you can build three separate vehicles with it and they have like this different key that
4421860	4422880	goes in there.
4422880	4425820	So there's like a driving one that actually has a foot pedal.
4425820	4432340	There's like a submarine thing and an airplane joystick and that should be coming out.
4432340	4437180	I don't know when the date is on that, but the trailer is pretty cool and we don't know
4437180	4443020	the price yet, but I'm assuming it's going to be around the same price either 69 or $79.
4443020	4444020	But neat.
4444020	4445020	Oh, September.
4445020	4446020	That's right.
4446020	4448940	September is supposed to come out.
4448940	4452980	Just for the record, Dark Tetsuya found it cause that's, that's what our live listeners
4452980	4453980	do.
4453980	4455760	The calculator was called the little professor.
4455760	4458460	It was a little, little professor was the name of it.
4458460	4463580	And his little hat is that, um, what did they call the screens that were like the real
4463580	4469860	red glowing led or were they led LCD, but they were red and glowing and looking for
4469860	4470860	evil.
4470860	4471860	Yeah.
4471860	4475540	They used to make alarm clocks out of those back in the day and it was like, it's 6am.
4475540	4476660	You're going to go to hell.
4476660	4478740	Like that's what things look like in the dark.
4478740	4479740	Virtual boy.
4479740	4480740	Yeah.
4480740	4481740	They still sell those.
4481740	4482740	What little professors?
4482740	4483740	No, the clocks.
4483740	4484740	Oh really?
4484740	4485740	Oh my gosh.
4485740	4486740	I have one for my son.
4486740	4487740	All right.
4487740	4488740	Both my kids have those.
4488740	4489740	Scare.
4489740	4490740	I'm young.
4490740	4491740	All right.
4491740	4492740	They're blue.
4492740	4493740	I mean, they're not red.
4493740	4499060	Well, speaking of amazing computers and it's, I, it's almost like we planned it this way.
4499060	4506380	Uh, the Commodore 64 mini is coming to the U S very cool about this.
4506380	4513420	So, uh, the common, the C 64 mini is, uh, going to be loaded with ready for this 64
4513420	4515540	classic titles.
4515540	4519420	Where did they pull that number out of the hat?
4519420	4523660	Remember, remember just last week on this show when you couldn't remember how much memory
4523660	4530340	was in a Commodore 64 Loki, I didn't have a Commodore 64, 64 kilobytes.
4530340	4535200	That could, that 64 can admit anything anyway, it could have been the speed.
4535200	4536200	It could have been anything.
4536200	4537200	All right.
4537200	4538200	Be quiet.
4538200	4542100	Some of the notable titles include California games, winter games, impossible mission to,
4542100	4547140	Oh, I hope the first one's there to, uh, Boulder dash, uh, jump man, pit stop to speedball
4547140	4552900	to street sports, baseball, summer games to the temple of app, shy trilogy, uh, your radium.
4552900	4555660	Like I know some of you guys are like, I've never heard of this shit.
4555660	4558140	Those are all fucking classics that I just named right there.
4558140	4559920	Amazing, amazing list of games there.
4559920	4561820	So of course it all connects via HTMI.
4561820	4566540	Uh, and I guess right now, uh, October 9th is the date that they're targeting and you
4566540	4571340	can get more details at the C 64.com.
4571340	4576460	And if I remember right, you can still, you, because it actually is like a full functional
4576460	4577460	keyboard and everything.
4577460	4580820	You can still use these like they are a Commodore 64.
4580820	4587060	So yeah, they say complete with a fully working version of C 64 basic and a USB joystick.
4587060	4589380	So I can actually start to write programs.
4589380	4591920	I don't know how it's going to save or any of that stuff.
4591920	4595600	And I'm sure, I'm sure somebody's already figured it because I think this thing's already
4595600	4598020	been out in Europe where the Commodore 64 is even bigger.
4598020	4604700	I'm sure somebody's thought of a way to like load their own C 64 discs and disc images
4604700	4605700	onto this thing.
4605700	4606700	There's gotta be.
4606700	4612140	So I can play like the C 64 games that I loved that nobody else loved, like the Dragon's
4612140	4614020	Lair games.
4614020	4618300	I'm telling you the Dragon's Lair games, there was two of them because, um, and it's nothing
4618300	4622420	like the Dragon's Lair arcade game because obviously the arcade game is too, it was too
4622420	4626700	strong graphically, but the music in those games are some of my favorite chiptunes like
4626700	4630500	ever in like the C 64 era.
4630500	4631500	Anyway.
4631500	4635880	Uh, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, you don't even have to hack it.
4635880	4638260	They tell you exactly how to do it.
4638260	4643340	A new firmware update will allow you to have more than just one D 64 file.
4643340	4647220	Well that's pretty awesome, especially because I think one reason they kind of have to do
4647220	4652500	this is that those disc images, like those magnetic discs are like eroding over time.
4652500	4654740	Like those discs are not holding up all these years later.
4654740	4660740	So are we going to be, are we going to be able to run Gios on this?
4660740	4661740	You know what Gios is?
4661740	4666100	It made your Commodore 64 look just like a early, early Macintosh early cause it was
4666100	4672060	like graphic evolution, something operating system, graphic enhanced, gravity enhanced
4672060	4673060	operating system.
4673060	4674060	Gios.
4674060	4675060	Let's give it a gooey.
4675060	4676060	Anyway.
4676060	4683500	The only game I ever played on the Commodore 64 was kickstart motorcycle racing game.
4683500	4684500	Oh man.
4684500	4685500	I'm so excited.
4685500	4688700	I can't wait for this to come out because then I'm going to be hooking it up and like
4688700	4690100	streaming all the things on Twitch.
4690100	4693140	I'm so excited cause I love color 64 anyway.
4693140	4698380	The classic game of the week, however, dark soccer is going to dip into the gaming archives.
4698380	4702460	Sadly not from the Commodore 64, but there's just so many things to pick from, you know,
4702460	4705200	so dark soccer has picked a mighty fine choice this week.
4705200	4709100	I'm assuming it's gotta be something that came from California extreme.
4709100	4710100	I don't know.
4710100	4711100	Maybe.
4711100	4712100	No.
4712100	4713100	Oh wow.
4713100	4714100	That's something that got inspired from that.
4714100	4715100	All right.
4715100	4716100	Well then let's get to it.
4716100	4717100	I already had an idea to do this one.
4717100	4718100	I just put it off.
4718100	4719100	All right.
4719100	4722220	So, uh, every week you jump in the vault and find a game that the kids should be playing
4722220	4723220	this week.
4723220	4724220	Dark soccer.
4724220	4725220	What should the kids be playing this week?
4725220	4726220	I think it's captain commando.
4726220	4727220	Fuck yes.
4727220	4728220	That game is awesome.
4728220	4729220	Yes it is.
4729220	4740140	And what people may not realize is that captain commando was supposed to have been the mascot
4740140	4741860	for Capcom during that particular period.
4741860	4742860	There had been earlier incarnations of him that eventually worked into the character
4742860	4743860	we had in the video game.
4743860	4744860	Um, so it came out in 1991.
4744860	4754860	It was a futuristic side school and beat him up and it was released on the CP system.
4754860	4760900	Um, that was actually the 17th title in the CP system and he was conceived again as their
4760900	4764180	spokesperson to use in the late eighties.
4764180	4768220	So basically, um, you have four characters in this beat them up.
4768220	4771740	You have captain commando, who is the leader of the team.
4771740	4776420	Um, you have in the U S I'm going to give us things on the Japanese names.
4776420	4782780	Mac the knife, who is also named Jannetty in the Japanese version, who is a mummy commando
4782780	4783780	from outer space.
4783780	4788660	Um, he has this spinning attack, he's pretty fun.
4788660	4793620	And of course the U S name came after the song that's mac the knife.
4793620	4801300	Um, anyway, Genzu, the ninja who was called Shou in the Japanese version is a ninja, the
4801300	4808140	successor to the Bushimiya Nippo, um, who actually that same style was used by guy in
4808140	4809140	final fight.
4809140	4810860	So there you go.
4810860	4816780	Um, and then baby head, also known as Hoover, uh, Hoover.
4816780	4822660	Basically baby commando is a genius infant who fights in a robot that he designed.
4822660	4832420	Um, he has knee rockets, that's all you need to know, but he's a baby driving a mecha.
4832420	4835380	So anyway, it is basically, it plays a lot like final fight.
4835380	4839620	It is a beat them up, you have up to four players at the same time.
4839620	4844620	You can choose any of the four commandos and you know, each person has a different one.
4844660	4849100	So, um, the control configuration is just like final fight with an eight-way joystick.
4849100	4855100	Um, you can move left or right or toward or away and the buttons for attacking ninja.
4855100	4860420	Um, you also can pick up health restoring items, you can pick up, you can beat up destructible
4860420	4865820	objects and you can get bonus items and weapons.
4865820	4873460	So yeah, uh, the early, uh, captain commando looked like he honestly looked like he was
4873460	4874460	from the seventies.
4874460	4880300	He had like white flowing hair and gold chains around his neck and this disco looking outfit.
4880300	4888460	And then later on in the eighties he looked like, you know, the eighties spaceman.
4888460	4892220	Some fricking in-stream ad popped up and I didn't even notice it.
4892220	4894220	You need to put it on the ad blocker.
4894220	4898220	They don't always work anymore.
4898220	4899220	Anyway.
4899980	4906740	But anyway, um, many of Capcom's early titles in the NES featured, um, captain commando
4906740	4914340	on it between 1986 and 1989, um, 1942 commando, ghost and goblins, mega man, Trojan section
4914340	4920940	Z and gun smoke, um, all released as part of the cap captain commando challenge series
4920940	4928340	and had him on the back of the packaging in his futuristic space hero ray gun outfit with
4928460	4933780	his medallion that said, you know, see on each of them, very disco.
4933780	4939180	And then, um, the revised version of the one that looked, you know, more like a comic,
4939180	4945500	you know, it was almost like a GI Joe character, but futuristic, um, was in the 1989 lineup,
4945500	4948620	like strider, mega man, two willow and duck tales.
4948620	4952900	Um, so that's the pilot suit fighter jet style.
4952980	4960980	Um, and there was also a message on the artwork that said to the reader to look, look to him
4960980	4968740	for up to date reports for all exciting action games from Capcom and including this feature.
4968740	4974740	So other releases of captain commando we had, um, on the super nest, it came out in 1995.
4974740	4979300	It's only a two player one and shows fewer enemies, uh, on screen and doesn't have the
4979300	4980300	mech suit.
4980700	4982060	Um, it also is censored.
4982060	4988940	The PlayStation report came out in Japan on September 17th, 1998 by new ink.
4988940	4993380	Has up to three players with a multiplayer, using a multiplayer adapter.
4993380	4999980	Um, then we also had, uh, the CPS game, the full original version and Capcom classics
4999980	5005820	collection remix for PSP and Capcom's Capcom classics collection volume two for PS2 and
5005820	5007740	Xbox in 2006.
5007740	5009460	They were going to do a Sega CD version.
5009620	5011620	It was announced, but never released.
5011620	5012620	It was canceled.
5012620	5018740	As for the captain himself, he was a playable character in Marvel versus Capcom.
5018740	5024260	And um, that was in 1998 and he had a transformation sequence that had him going from a cowboy
5024260	5026380	outfit before going to superhero.
5026380	5033780	Um, he had his attacks from the game and his victory quotes are random Capcom trivia.
5033780	5039500	Um, you know, as a tribute to his, you know, old stuff.
5039500	5046180	Um, he was also in Marvel versus Capcom two, also in Capcom world two, Capcom cross, uh,
5046180	5052180	sorry, NAMCO cross Capcom project X zone two and SNK versus Capcom card fighters flash.
5052180	5058180	He was also in the Udon comics, um, a two volume manga that came out that was, uh, I'm
5058180	5060580	sorry, translated and published by Udon.
5060980	5067300	Um, but also the other thing is that the other commandos did show up in, in, uh, Marvel versus
5067300	5069780	Capcom for one of his hyper combo finishes.
5069780	5076660	So, um, the super Famicom game got a 21 out of 40 for Famicom sutin.
5076660	5081780	Um, the arcade game was listed as one of the top 21 beat em up games by heavy.com.
5081780	5083540	And there you go, captain commando.
5083540	5084660	Awesome game.
5084660	5089860	I used to go back as a, as a child because, you know, we used to go ride around on our
5089860	5094740	bikes and then local, you know, town to go play the different arcade games that were
5094740	5095060	everywhere.
5095060	5099620	So they had, you know, of course the street fighter two at the seven 11, but there was
5099620	5105940	a cafe that had captain commando and we'd go there and just play that all the way through
5105940	5106820	when they get hamburger.
5107540	5108260	I love that game.
5109220	5109940	All right.
5109940	5110340	There it is.
5110340	5111380	Your classic game of the week.
5111380	5112260	Captain commando.
5113860	5114900	No, I never have.
5114900	5115540	Believe it or not.
5115540	5117300	Weren't the mechs that were in this one.
5117300	5121060	Those also in mega man X as well, because I remember they had like different elemental
5121060	5122260	mechs similar, you know?
5122260	5126580	And what's interesting too is that even though I never played that game, I remember the captain
5126580	5130820	captain commando being like the capcom mascot for like a real hot minute in like some of
5130820	5134740	the early NES manuals on, uh, you know, bring it back, do it.
5134740	5137060	Hey, Inti create.
5137060	5140900	If Nintendo says no to Zelda, how about a new captain commando?
5141460	5142740	Captain commando for smash.
5144260	5145620	I'd be down for that shit.
5145620	5147380	He was in Marvel versus capcom too.
5147380	5148820	And it was fucking awesome.
5148820	5150580	You know, I always used to play as captain commando.
5150580	5154100	You know, the latest big rumors, of course, there's always going to be rumors about smash
5154100	5154500	characters.
5154500	5158340	So take it with a gigantic, take it with like the, all of the salt Luigi.
5158340	5161300	They're going to add Waluigi because everyone's been bitching about Waluigi.
5161300	5164180	No, uh, apparently two more that are going to be revealed soon.
5164180	5165700	Isabel, which makes sense.
5165700	5167060	I mean, that one makes total sense.
5167060	5172100	Like Isabel is the subject of many interesting memes in Japan, uh, and in here too.
5172100	5173780	So Isabel would make a lot of sense.
5174100	5177060	Simon Belmont, the other one, I guess that they're talking about.
5177060	5181220	So he was in that, um, that Nintendo 64 smash game.
5181220	5182340	So yeah, who knows?
5182340	5182740	Who knows?
5182740	5186420	Any of these first appearance in a smash game too, that, uh, I don't remember what it's
5186420	5189060	called, but they also had optimus prime in that game.
5189060	5189860	And that was awesome.
5190740	5192980	Was it dream something TV?
5192980	5197540	I don't remember the name of it, but I'm, I'm not going to hold my breath on any of
5197540	5199140	these news or rumors in that too.
5199140	5201460	Barbie for smash, Barbie for smash.
5201460	5202180	Heck yeah.
5202180	5202740	All right.
5202740	5206260	Anyway, uh, we're gonna take a break while we contemplate all the characters we want
5206260	5207060	to be in smash.
5207060	5209140	When we come back, we have some rapid fire news.
5209140	5212340	We're gonna talk about release dates, your emails and more stories.
5212340	5213460	So don't go anywhere, folks.
5213460	5214740	We will be right back.
5220900	5224580	Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight.
5224580	5232580	Episode number 739 of our show already in progress for tonight, July 29th of 2018.
5232580	5234660	We have some more news to get into.
5234660	5237940	We're going to get into rapid fire news here shortly, but a dark soccer, I believe you're
5237940	5239300	going to be taken off, right?
5239300	5239780	Yeah.
5239780	5244420	I, um, I actually spent most of yesterday with a headache at the event and then I came
5244420	5248020	home with an even worse headache and it's been growing again today.
5248020	5253460	So it's drive now and be safe to drive or sleep on your couch and not go to work tomorrow.
5253460	5257780	So we can always stay on the couch if you need to, but I understand you want to, you
5257780	5258820	got to go home so you can go to work.
5258820	5259540	So, all right.
5259540	5260740	Well, thank you as always for being here.
5260740	5261940	Any final thoughts for our listeners?
5263220	5266420	Um, um, strawberry rhubarb pie is delicious.
5266420	5267620	It is pretty delicious.
5267620	5268500	I feel better.
5268500	5268900	Okay.
5268900	5270820	Also, it's so weird looking at you right now.
5271380	5271780	Why?
5271780	5274660	With, with, without your, oh, without my beard.
5274660	5274980	Yeah.
5274980	5278660	It's been that way for like a month, but it's, it's, well, now that yesterday's very clean
5278660	5279140	right now.
5279140	5279220	Yeah.
5279220	5279780	Well, yeah.
5279780	5280820	Cause I had to, yeah.
5280820	5283700	Cause I was kind of like, I would let it get a little scruffy and then be like, oh yeah,
5283700	5285300	I got a little bit like you've waxed.
5286020	5287860	No, I didn't, I didn't go that far.
5287860	5290820	Um, so yesterday, and there's some Queens who wax.
5290820	5293380	If you guys didn't know, I think I made this pretty clear.
5293380	5294900	I did the production of clue.
5294900	5299700	I played Mrs. Peacock and it all kind of ties into, if you know the movie in the, one of
5299700	5301700	the endings, they go just like the Mounties.
5301700	5302900	We always get our man.
5302900	5306260	Mrs. Peacock was a man slap, you know, that thing.
5306260	5307380	So that was the joke.
5307380	5307860	Right.
5307860	5311540	Uh, and I, I'd seen like a drag performance of his peacock like 10 years ago.
5311540	5313140	And I always thought it was like the funniest thing I ever saw.
5313140	5316100	So I was like, okay, I want to do it for this show, but I fully committed.
5316100	5317460	So, you know, I shaved my face.
5317460	5318340	So the red beard's gone.
5318340	5322420	So I just shaved yesterday morning was probably when I last shaved.
5322420	5324180	But then I don't know if you also notice, look at this.
5324180	5328500	I shaved my legs because I tried to do the stocking trick, but it didn't work.
5329220	5332980	So, um, and the stocking trick is that you wear multiple pairs of stockings, but just
5332980	5333620	wasn't happening.
5333620	5337860	But you'll notice I only shaved them up to here where the dress came down to.
5337860	5339860	I don't, you got to admit shaved legs.
5339860	5340980	Do you feel pretty nice?
5340980	5341860	No, I hate it.
5341860	5342260	Really?
5344660	5345140	Really?
5345140	5345540	I don't know.
5345540	5346420	I don't know.
5346420	5350260	I've never liked like stubble on my arms or my legs.
5350260	5351380	I shaved my arms too.
5351380	5352020	Yeah.
5352020	5353940	And I don't like the way the wind feels.
5353940	5358100	I did that as well, but I cheated a little bit because it didn't really grow all back
5358100	5359140	when I did it two weeks ago.
5359140	5360260	So I kind of kept that.
5360260	5361860	And it's the same thing with my chest.
5361860	5365060	Like I shaved it two weeks ago and it didn't grow back enough.
5365060	5367460	So I kind of didn't redo it yesterday.
5367460	5372340	So, but I mean, it's just, it's just a sensitivity thing for me.
5372340	5377860	But if I'm gonna like not wear jeans, then I like for to not have hair to get caught
5377860	5378900	in wind or anything.
5378900	5379460	Yeah, no.
5379460	5381780	And that's the weird thing now is wearing jeans.
5381780	5387300	It's like I feel weird in this area where I see I like how that feels because it's like
5387300	5387940	clean.
5387940	5393460	But let the record show I am fully committed to my art because, you know, drag is not something
5393460	5394260	I usually do.
5394260	5394660	Okay.
5394660	5395140	I know.
5395140	5399540	I know if there's a lot of stereotypes out there that that's what all gay guys do for
5399540	5400420	fun on Friday nights.
5400420	5401300	That's so not true.
5401300	5402420	Just being clear.
5402420	5405620	But I did it for a performance for the laughs.
5405620	5408340	And, you know, it seemed to go over really well.
5408340	5412900	I got a lot of really positive feedback last night and just some really like nice, nice
5412900	5413060	things.
5413060	5416340	I was very impressed with your royal leg slant.
5417220	5417460	Oh.
5417460	5418260	The picture on the couch.
5418260	5418580	Oh yeah.
5418580	5419540	When I was sitting on the couch.
5419540	5421300	Well, because my heels were, I don't know.
5421300	5424580	But yes, I did the Rolex because she's not crossing her legs in the movie.
5424580	5424820	Right.
5424820	5425860	I remember when you shadow cast.
5426420	5430260	But at the same time, I didn't want to show because I wasn't wearing much under that.
5430900	5431220	Yeah.
5431220	5431620	Dress.
5432180	5436900	And I did not go that fully committed to my drag art.
5436900	5437780	We'll leave it at that.
5437780	5440660	For that era though, the movie was supposed to represent.
5440660	5446100	However, it was considered a more wanton thing for a woman to cross her legs.
5446100	5446420	Yeah.
5446420	5447860	So that actually was period.
5447860	5448500	Correct.
5448500	5449140	So, okay.
5449140	5449540	So yeah.
5449540	5450260	So I did.
5450260	5455060	So yeah, I did the whole like slanting instead so that you couldn't see up my dress perverts.
5455060	5456260	You were like Princess Kate.
5456260	5459380	Well, especially, especially when you're on that stage elevated.
5459380	5461620	So like your crotch is at eye level for everybody.
5461620	5463940	Like I had to be very like thinking about that.
5463940	5468980	And I felt, I felt kind of bad, bad for Yvette because Yvette dies on that billiard table.
5469700	5471940	And it's like, you can see London and France.
5471940	5473540	Now she was prepared for it.
5473540	5475380	So she had enough.
5475380	5477620	You weren't going to see nothing, but it was still, I was like.
5477620	5480740	She should have either had frilly, frilly pantalant, you know.
5480740	5481140	She did.
5481700	5484580	Or really colorful underwear.
5484580	5487140	No, she had, I told her to draw teeth on it, but.
5487140	5487640	Yeah.
5489140	5489700	She didn't.
5490260	5490820	Anyway.
5490820	5491140	All right.
5491860	5494500	I'm going to go before the drugs wear off.
5494500	5495140	Okay, good.
5495140	5495300	Yeah.
5495300	5499060	The chat is going bonds, double six says, OLR body hair episode.
5499940	5500740	Hey, you know what?
5501620	5504260	Every, everybody's, it's, it's the human body.
5504260	5506820	There are people who have trouble though, growing hair.
5506820	5507460	Sure.
5507460	5508740	And I'm not one of those people.
5509780	5514980	Well, I, I've, I had an ex who did not grow and, you know, I don't want to get into stereotypes,
5514980	5519380	but it is just, uh, guys that are a hundred percent Asian.
5519380	5520820	I've known some hairy Asian guys though.
5520820	5521540	Yeah, that is true.
5521540	5521940	That's true.
5521940	5526020	But a lot of guys that are like a hundred percent Asian don't always grow it like as much.
5526020	5527380	So, you know, it just depends.
5527380	5528420	My friend had alopecia.
5529060	5529700	Oh yeah.
5529700	5531620	Well, I knew a friend who had trichotillomania.
5531620	5533060	Well, I'm like, you know, that is right.
5533060	5534660	A lot of dudes have alopecia on their heads.
5534660	5536180	Where you pull your own hair.
5536980	5539540	Oh no, no, I've heard of that.
5539540	5541540	No, that's just called having children.
5542020	5547460	No, like they'll pick out their arm hair or their eyebrow or their, um, eyelashes and
5547460	5549540	they'll just, it's a nervous thing.
5549540	5553380	I only do that to fight off my eyelashes because they're trying to attack my eyes.
5553380	5554340	Same with my eyebrows.
5554340	5555460	Well, you know, how about this?
5555460	5558100	Uh, O-O-L-R, love your body no matter what.
5558100	5558980	That's, that's what it is.
5558980	5560020	Even with your manias.
5560020	5562740	Uh, Bond's 006 says, O-L-R, so you're a teenager.
5563940	5565140	All right, we need to move on.
5565140	5568660	See, you'll start this field differently about the opposite sex and then.
5568660	5569700	Or maybe not.
5569940	5573220	Or you won't feel differently at all.
5573220	5574180	You'll still be ace.
5576580	5577940	You'll feel awkward.
5577940	5579060	Very awkward.
5580180	5581860	No matter what, you're going to feel awkward.
5582500	5587940	And your skin at the time where you want to look your best, your skin will look its worst.
5589300	5592900	You will have a topographical map of the Himalayas on your face.
5592900	5597060	And I know that people like to tell you that it gets better when it comes to things like
5597060	5599140	that and for the most part, life does get better.
5599860	5602100	When it comes to your skin, it's never going to get better.
5602980	5604740	So that's why drugs exist.
5605300	5605800	All right.
5606340	5608180	Anyhow, let's move on.
5608180	5612100	Thank you to our soccer for getting us on a 10-minute tangent about non-gaming related things.
5612100	5616100	But let's get back into gaming and get into some rapid fire news.
5616100	5616600	Loki.
5617380	5619060	Yes, so this is pretty cool.
5619060	5621380	And I've actually kind of looked at this game myself and bought it.
5621380	5626100	So I bad on me, but, um, it's a really neat indie game.
5626100	5630580	I know it was one that I was kind of interested in because it was a unity made game.
5630580	5635300	But the hat and a hat in time, which has been out on several different platforms,
5635300	5640740	that PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One has finally sold 500,000 copies, which is great.
5640740	5645780	And it for those not familiar with the game, it's kind of like a 3D platform or akin to
5645780	5647860	like a Mario 64 or something like that.
5647860	5651380	But it's cute and definitely worth checking out.
5651380	5652580	I wish it was on the Switch.
5652580	5653700	I would totally pick it up on the Switch.
5654100	5656100	I guess I'll have to play it on the PlayStation 4.
5656100	5658900	Yeah, I don't really know this game, so I'll have to check it out.
5658900	5660020	Yeah, it looks really cool.
5660020	5661220	So definitely check that out.
5662100	5668660	The other one is Freeze Me, which is not this game, but it's similar to Mario 64.
5668660	5673780	Anyways, and then, of course, as always, each month we have our free games.
5673780	5675140	I'm not sure what PlayStation is.
5675140	5677140	I checked and they didn't have the listing for it yet.
5677140	5680740	But for the Microsoft side of things in August,
5680740	5686980	we're going to be getting Forza Horizon 2 Standard 10th Anniversary Edition is going
5686980	5689860	to be free August 1st, the 31st.
5689860	5695860	And For Honor is going to be available from August 16th through September 15th.
5696580	5703380	And then on the Xbox 360 compatible games, we have Dead Space 3 and Disney's Epic Mickey 2.
5704500	5705300	So interesting.
5705300	5706100	That's pretty awesome.
5706100	5710260	So Dead Space, first half of the month and Epic Mickey 2, second half of the month.
5710340	5712580	To this day, I still hate the name Epic Mickey.
5713620	5714120	Yeah.
5714820	5715700	But that's all right.
5716500	5718820	The game is supposed to be pretty decent, but I don't know.
5718820	5721140	Yeah, I think the second game a lot of people kind of passed on,
5721140	5723300	but I heard it was better than the first.
5723300	5727060	I like the idea of like this twisted Magic Kingdom stuff.
5727060	5729540	I wish they went more with that, but then, you know.
5729540	5731860	Well, now many people have a chance to visit it.
5731860	5733860	Act F says the second game was OK-ish.
5733860	5735700	Well, maybe it's free.
5735700	5736420	That's right.
5736420	5737780	That's not an OK-ish price.
5737780	5739060	Free with your subscription.
5739060	5739380	Yeah.
5739380	5740340	Yeah. All right.
5740340	5743460	Anyway, I have a couple of stories with audio to go with it,
5743460	5745620	including a story about WarioWare Gold.
5746340	5750900	Apparently, I thought that WarioWare Gold was supposed to be like just a mix of like greatest
5750900	5753620	hits, but apparently there's like newer stuff that showed up in it too.
5754180	5755540	Some of the mini games have been redone.
5755540	5756740	And then there's this.
5756740	5762260	There is a mini game in it called Mutroid 2, Return of Sam-Meow.
5763460	5764340	So that's right.
5764340	5769220	It is a Metroid-ish type of game full of cats.
5769220	5769940	Oh, I don't know.
5769940	5773060	It's not really Metroid, but the music is sure Metroid.
5777700	5782020	And you're this little cat with a gun and you're shooting all these little turtles
5783060	5784340	as they're trying to get up to you.
5787460	5789860	Anyway, I love it.
5789860	5790180	I know.
5790180	5790900	I love it too.
5790900	5793540	Like I was like, well, I'm not going to buy this WarioWare game on 3DS.
5793620	5794900	It's just a mix of all the old stuff.
5794900	5796500	And now I'm like, God damn it.
5796500	5797140	God damn it.
5797140	5801940	They're really going to get me to do that when I thought I was out and pulling right back in.
5801940	5802260	All right.
5802260	5809060	Anyway, so speaking of audio related things, the Smash Brothers Ultimate page has been
5809060	5812100	revealing some of the new music that's going to be in the game.
5812100	5813060	Get this.
5813060	5816100	There is a new F-Zero arrangement in the game.
5816740	5819060	So that's awesome, but it gets better.
5819620	5825620	Uh, Takunobu Mitsuyoshi is the musician behind this.
5825620	5826900	Have you ever heard that name before?
5827860	5828660	I'll give you a hint.
5828660	5830020	He sang a song and it went like this.
5833780	5837060	So the Daytona guy is doing an F-Zero song.
5837060	5838420	Are you fucking ready to hear this?
5838420	5840260	I don't know if I am ever ready to hear this.
5840260	5841220	You cannot handle this.
5841700	5848740	Okay.
5848740	5851060	And then he, when he gets in the seat, let me, let me move forward a little bit.
5851060	5852820	He sings a little more in the second half of this clip.
5856500	5857300	Come on.
5857300	5858020	Get some more singing.
5861140	5862580	Ah, this is such a good clip though.
5862580	5874340	I'm okay with this.
5874340	5877940	It's like things I didn't know I needed until I had them.
5879860	5880420	I love it.
5881060	5883780	Anyway, so please, please more stuff like that.
5883780	5888900	Like, you know, and one thing I think we tend to forget about the Smash Brothers game games,
5888900	5891060	they never slack in the music department.
5891060	5892660	They never slack in the music department.
5892660	5896740	Can we get a new F-Zero game and then have the Daytona car as a special unlock?
5896740	5897700	That'd be amazing.
5898340	5898980	Oh my God.
5899620	5902020	Act Def says I want an F-Zero with this music.
5902020	5904020	I want any type of F-Zero.
5904020	5904740	And Act Def goes,
5904740	5910740	Do you think if they're making arrangements of music that perhaps they are working on something?
5910740	5912580	Or do they just do this for Smash?
5912580	5916020	I feel like this is a Smash thing because the Smash thing is usually where you get like these
5916020	5918340	big legendary artists to do like songs.
5918340	5919140	But I don't know.
5919140	5919540	We'll see.
5920020	5921300	Well, since you're here.
5921300	5921700	Yeah.
5921700	5922180	Right.
5922180	5922980	You can hope.
5922980	5923460	You can hope.
5923460	5924980	Or as Fifth Dream in chat says,
5925700	5927380	Perhaps.
5927380	5928980	Since we just had a story about cats.
5928980	5929220	All right.
5929220	5929540	Forget it.
5929540	5931460	That should be a full fledged game right there.
5931460	5933220	What else do we have, Loki?
5933220	5934020	All right.
5934020	5939620	So remember that whole adaptive Xbox controller for, you know, accessibility and stuff like that?
5939620	5943140	So, of course, they went the extra mile of not only thinking about the
5943140	5947060	accessibility of the controller, but the accessibility of the packaging.
5947860	5954260	So they actually addressed the need of, you know, people that might be disabled
5954260	5955460	with the packaging as well.
5955460	5960580	So they would be able to open the cardboard box with limited mobility and that type of thing.
5960580	5961540	So that's pretty awesome.
5961540	5966180	So they had this loop that you would be able to pull that would kind of help with
5966180	5971860	opening the packaging on the box and stuff and to get the controller out of the box.
5971860	5974660	You had another loop to pull and everything.
5974660	5976180	So that is pretty neat.
5977060	5979220	That they went that far as to think about packaging.
5979220	5979700	Yeah.
5979700	5984660	Like, I don't have challenges when it comes to opening packaging.
5984660	5987620	And, you know, even though sometimes the stuff that, you know,
5987620	5990580	Unless it's in those fucking clam shells or yeah.
5990580	5993780	But anyway, all that aside, like, I was looking at the unboxing of this.
5993780	5994980	I'm like, that looks like fun.
5994980	5997380	That looks like to open that looks like kind of like fun.
5997380	5999540	You know, it's very, very different.
5999540	6000900	So that's really cool.
6001780	6002820	That's cool for everyone.
6002900	6007700	But especially the fact that, you know, it helps differently abled folks is really cool.
6007700	6008340	So, yeah.
6008340	6008840	Neat.
6009540	6014580	And the other thing, of course, is Homestar Runner is going to be getting its own board
6014580	6017220	game thanks to a Kickstarter program.
6018180	6020500	So they have, yeah, Homestar Runners.
6020500	6026020	And it's an area control game which will allow up to two to six players work together to
6026020	6032580	help a beefy armed dragon completely decimate a kingdom by using unique powers and items.
6032580	6033080	Awesome.
6033940	6035460	So it's pretty awesome looking.
6036980	6040980	Apparently, they had a seventy five thousand dollar goal.
6040980	6043540	They blew through that immediately.
6043540	6049380	And right now, with three weeks left, they are over seven hundred fifty thousand dollars
6050420	6052020	and onto stretch goals.
6052020	6054500	So I had a feeling that would get funded pretty quick.
6054500	6056580	So I'm glad that that turned out well.
6056580	6058100	Let's hope that it actually gets released.
6058100	6060260	Yeah, they're eight hundred forty four thousand right now.
6060820	6065860	Let's just hope that everything goes well, because, you know, Kickstarter can be a little
6065860	6066980	bit shady sometimes.
6067620	6071140	Dr. C wants to remind you in our chair room that he does have a name.
6071140	6073140	The name is Traktor.
6074500	6075000	Right.
6075940	6077300	I think Loki just didn't want to say it.
6077300	6077800	All right.
6078580	6081620	Anyhow, we're going to get to some release dates here in just a moment.
6081620	6084740	Looking at some other comments in chat over at live.vodka.org.com.
6084740	6086740	Act Def says, yeah, they do this for Smash.
6086740	6088900	They did a ton of arrangements for Brawl.
6089860	6090500	Like this.
6090500	6092100	So, yeah, I wouldn't get your hopes up.
6092100	6098020	Loki, there's a whole new game coming for F-Zero, although I really, really wish it
6098020	6098660	would be.
6098660	6102260	But anyhow, what games are coming out that I will get to play Loki in the US?
6103060	6109300	So in the US, we're going to get to play a game called Chasm, which is or I guess Chasm,
6109300	6113220	which would be on PC, PlayStation 4 and the Vita.
6113300	6116980	We have Code of Princess EX on the Nintendo Switch.
6117700	6120660	Titan Quest on the Nintendo Switch.
6120660	6122660	Yakuza 0 on PC.
6123380	6127300	This is the police on PC, Mac and Linux.
6127300	6127780	Is it now?
6127780	6128180	Oh, I'm sorry.
6128180	6129300	This is the police 2.
6129940	6131060	It's the sequel.
6131060	6133300	I didn't know there was a this is the police war was.
6133300	6134580	Yes, I remember it.
6134580	6137860	And then finally, WarioWare Gold on the 3DS.
6137860	6138980	So you can play Mutroid.
6139780	6141220	Yes, that's really the only reason.
6141220	6142500	Well, that is WarioWare.
6142500	6143060	It's amazing.
6143380	6146740	Why it's not on the Switch for no reason whatsoever.
6147380	6147860	I don't know.
6148660	6148980	All right.
6148980	6151700	Well, heading over to Japan and then maybe you could fill in with the UK dates.
6151700	6156260	And so Jimmy, I believe going over to Japan, checking out the releases there on the PlayStation
6156260	6161220	4 on August 2nd, Friday the 13th, the game gets released in Japan, which seems a bummer.
6161220	6164180	It's probably a little late over there in Japan because the game is not really going
6164180	6165460	to be getting supported anymore.
6165460	6169140	I guess they ran into some issues with the movie and stuff, which which kind of sucks
6169140	6172420	because the game was like like everybody was fucking playing that when it was first out.
6172420	6173140	It was a lot of fun.
6173140	6175780	And then it just it kind of died off like real quick.
6175780	6180420	So it's I'm kind of bummed that that game had such inertia behind it and they kind of
6180420	6181380	dropped the ball.
6181380	6184580	And I think a lot of it has to I don't I don't necessarily think it's the developer's fault.
6184580	6188180	I think it just has to spin off with more horror.
6188180	6193060	I know they should make just they should just make their own horror thing game that just
6193060	6195380	doesn't even use the Friday the 13th characters.
6195380	6200580	And if they just put by the makers of Friday the 13th game, people will people will check
6200580	6202580	out like make new characters.
6202580	6206420	And you can even have different characters that people could play as it would be different
6206420	6207620	abilities or multiple.
6208260	6213140	I don't think like any of the campers are based off of real people, except for the one
6213140	6215860	that you revive, one of the players to bring back like that.
6215860	6216900	I can't remember who that was.
6216900	6218740	It's from like Friday, 13th, part three or something.
6218740	6222260	There's there's like I don't think the kids are.
6222260	6224740	Yeah, they're generic.
6225700	6226020	All right.
6226020	6227780	Anyway, let's see.
6227780	6230900	Going to other comments or sorry, not other comments, but other games that are releasing
6230900	6232100	on the PlayStation for Japan.
6232740	6238740	Saga Scarlet Grace is out on August 2nd in Japan, as well as a game called Border Break
6238740	6240660	is out from Sega in Japan.
6240660	6245220	There's also a bunch of PS4 with the Border Break in them.
6245220	6250020	So I guess Border Break is a big enough game to be getting different PlayStations with
6250020	6250520	it.
6250980	6256020	I'm not super familiar with the series, but it's by Sega and it's 10 versus 10 high speed
6256020	6257940	robot battles is what this game is.
6257940	6259220	This is more up your alley, Loki.
6260020	6260900	It looks cool.
6261540	6263220	I don't know what it is.
6263220	6264980	Yeah, I want to know what it is.
6264980	6266420	You may have to look.
6266420	6267940	Yeah, it looks pretty bad ass.
6267940	6271300	I mean, you know, screenshots look pretty sweet.
6272020	6274340	And if you have yet to jump on Monster Hunter World, good news.
6274340	6277380	It's moving into like the best hits already.
6277380	6278660	It seems really fast.
6278660	6280500	But that means a price reduction over there in Japan.
6280500	6286820	It looks like either like a virtual on or like armored core almost.
6287780	6288580	I'm not down.
6288580	6289940	Man, is this coming over here?
6289940	6291060	I don't know.
6291060	6295540	Going to the switch, that saga Scarlet Grace is also out on the switch.
6295540	6301300	Otherwise, you also have pro Yaku Famista Evolution and Lego The Incredibles gets its
6301300	6302260	release over there.
6302260	6306340	There's also some different accessories with Mario's face and stuff on them.
6306340	6308660	If that is your sort of it was an arcade game.
6308660	6310580	That's why I recognize it.
6310580	6311080	Got it.
6311860	6312340	Okay.
6312340	6313940	How about the UK, Loki?
6313940	6314260	All right.
6314260	6315700	UK is not getting a whole ton of stuff.
6315700	6320580	They're getting Titan Quest as well on the switch and Hello Neighbor on the switch and
6320580	6322580	on PlayStation four.
6322580	6323780	And that's unfortunately it.
6325300	6326100	All right.
6326100	6330900	Well, let's go to the mailbag because every week you guys send us emails and we read some
6330900	6332100	of our favorites here on the show.
6333620	6335860	If you want to email us, I encourage you to do so.
6335860	6340180	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6340180	6342660	And we do have one email in the mailbag tonight.
6342660	6344020	It's nice to hear from some folks.
6344020	6346020	One email in the mailbag tonight.
6346020	6350980	And tonight's email comes to us courtesy of Frodo Swagons, who emails us the following.
6351540	6354740	Rob, I was watching your stream this week of No Man's Sky.
6354740	6355140	Thank you.
6355140	6356660	I recognize the name from the stream.
6356660	6357460	Thank you.
6357460	6361460	I know you'll probably mention it in your gaming week, but I was curious to know what
6361460	6362900	you think of the update.
6363460	6366420	Um, I, is it something you will continue to play?
6366420	6368580	Also, I was wondering about the multiplayer.
6368580	6372260	I know you can have up to four people in your game, but I can't understand what the point
6372260	6376820	is in naming a creature that you discover or making your base discoverable for other
6376820	6378980	players when it seems to be invite only.
6378980	6382900	How would anyone stumble across something of yours if it's not some type of mega server?
6382900	6384660	I guess I'm a bit confused there.
6384660	6386420	Weekly listener is a big mega server.
6386420	6387300	Frodo Swagons.
6387300	6387620	Yeah.
6387620	6392100	And Frodo, I think I think that might be the misunderstanding there is that it is a mega
6392100	6392500	server.
6392580	6398420	You are connecting to, um, problem is it's such a vast universe that you probably won't
6398420	6399060	run across.
6399700	6405220	Um, the person that you're like, if I was trying to find Rob, you know, without actually
6405220	6408660	joining his game or something like that, it would probably be very impossible for me to
6408660	6409380	run across.
6409380	6413540	There's ways to do it because Dungeon Buster got to us in his main game and I don't know
6413540	6414340	how he did it.
6414340	6418260	Like if I was just casually playing the game, I wouldn't probably run across stuff.
6418260	6418740	No, no.
6419220	6423460	Well, and I think that was the whole reason why the developers kind of thought maybe they
6423460	6426180	didn't need multiplayer in the beginning is they're like, the universe is too huge.
6426180	6428740	You're never going to run into other people because there's too many places to be.
6429300	6433460	But I do know when I did play the first version of the game, it took me a little while.
6433460	6438820	Um, but I transported like, you know, I went like 10 jumps, 10 different galaxies in and
6438820	6441860	I got to a galaxy that somebody else had named.
6441860	6445060	So I saw there and I think they kept the default name or whatever.
6445060	6447220	Like a lot of people just keep the default names.
6447220	6451300	But I saw this guy's name and it said it was credited.
6451300	6456260	It was discovered by and then whoever the gamer tag was on PlayStation four.
6456260	6463620	Um, so in the case of like Planet Blissey that I named, if some rando comes across that
6463620	6465940	universe, they're going to see Planet Blissey.
6465940	6468020	Uh, and so they'll be like, Blissey, what is this?
6468020	6468580	So they'll know.
6468580	6470740	Well, they'll see my name that I'm the one that discovered it.
6470740	6472020	So they'll land in there.
6472020	6475940	And then of course the universe Bobby Black Wolf named is a Voglandia.
6475940	6477460	I think that was a Voglandia.
6477460	6481140	So, um, you know, people are going to see right away that people have been here before
6481140	6484180	and that's going to be, um, your first hint.
6484180	6489700	Now in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says it's from when you start
6489700	6494340	the game, you can choose to start your own game or join a friends if they are online.
6494340	6497220	So, but, but aren't you starting a new game when you do that Dungeon Buster?
6497220	6500180	Or can you take like your old data and move to the new one?
6500180	6500660	I don't know.
6500660	6506020	But when you do play online, um, you can, yeah, you, you will basically start in the
6506020	6508980	universe that your friends started in.
6508980	6511060	And that's what we kind of learned was happening.
6511060	6515300	Like by the time I went to Planet Blissey, which was a different planet in the system,
6515300	6519700	more people were joining the game like, uh, Bobby Black Wolf, like my friend Neil.
6519700	6524340	And they started in the exact same place I did on the starting planet.
6524340	6528260	And they figured it out because I had named one of the creatures Kitty.
6528260	6530900	Because it was this adorable little thing that was walking around.
6530900	6533380	I just got kitty because that's Alan does that.
6533380	6536100	Sometimes whenever he sees like a thing, he'll go kitty.
6536100	6540820	Um, so I named it kitty and Bobby, when he started his game, he's like, oh, I am where
6540820	6543460	you started because there's a lot of the resources aren't here.
6543460	6544500	And I just found kitty.
6545140	6548420	So, uh, it's kind of interesting how that worked.
6548420	6549380	So, uh, okay.
6549380	6553940	Dungeon Buster says I saved my game and went back to choose friends lobby and zoom.
6553940	6555140	I made it to Blissey.
6555140	6555780	Interesting.
6555780	6556420	Okay.
6556420	6557780	So there's ways to do it.
6557780	6562980	Um, the one thing I did think was interesting about the online though, and something I wish
6562980	6563540	they'd change.
6564420	6571060	When you do play online, meaning the multiplayer stuff, I believe the naming is always going
6571060	6571540	to be there.
6571540	6576340	But if you want people to be able to find you and all that stuff, uh, you can, uh, opt
6576340	6577380	to play online.
6577380	6580740	But when you do that, anyone can join your game.
6580740	6581220	Anyone.
6582180	6586980	There is no setting for friends only like most games have.
6586980	6591220	That would be my one feedback for hello games that I think is a really obvious thing that
6591220	6595700	they left out is I would really like to have a mode where friends only can come into my
6595700	6598580	solar system because I was playing the game.
6598580	6604100	And I think in the very first stream I did, I was playing the game and some Rando joined.
6604100	6607860	And at this point I already left the home planet and I really had no interest in going
6607860	6609540	back to go meet some Rando.
6609540	6611300	So I was just like, whatever, dude, you're on your own.
6611940	6616820	I'm curious if that Rando stayed with it or what they did, because it would be very
6616820	6621540	interesting to see if maybe he didn't figure out that Blissey was a great planet.
6621540	6624100	Maybe he tried to establish a presence somewhere else.
6624100	6627140	Or if when I left the game, he was like, fuck that guy and just left.
6627140	6627620	I don't know.
6627620	6628500	Who knows?
6628500	6634580	So anyway, um, dungeon buster continues, uh, getting back to my universe.
6634580	6636020	That was kind of messy after you left.
6636020	6640580	I tried using the gate from the space station in your system and ended up in empty space
6640580	6641940	killed by cosmic rays.
6641940	6642500	Wow.
6642500	6643700	I kept all my stuff.
6643700	6646180	It was just as if I jumped to a new system.
6646180	6648340	Only you and Black Wolf were there.
6648340	6648980	Interesting.
6650260	6651620	I kind of think that's interesting.
6651620	6654900	So you can kind of take your data and move it to other games wherever you want.
6654900	6655940	Well, that's kind of neat.
6655940	6660020	So, uh, I do know also they have that galactic map online.
6660020	6665780	So theoretically, if I could figure out how to give you the coordinates of Voglandia,
6665780	6670020	then you could look it up on this galactic map and you'd be able to see everything we're
6670020	6670420	doing there.
6670420	6672980	I don't, I don't know what all the galactic map tells you.
6672980	6674660	I guess we're still trying to figure some of that out.
6675220	6676340	So we'll see.
6676900	6682180	Uh, dungeon buster in chat says you can only invite friends, but so far you can't restrict
6682180	6683940	it to only friends.
6683940	6689140	So, uh, Kaijuto says, sorry, the universe is for all friends only is too secluded for
6689140	6689620	my taste.
6690500	6692180	You're changing it though, Kaijuto.
6692180	6697540	The universe is still open to all everything you name and all that stuff still changes
6697540	6698420	it with all.
6698420	6702580	The thing is, is that if you don't want to necessarily adventure with other people, then,
6702580	6706660	you know, I think you should be able to turn it off because the resources you gather, the
6706660	6709060	stuff you do, that does impact the planet.
6709060	6712580	So I could see how like people might lightly troll, but I don't think you'd really troll
6712580	6714580	anybody that bad in the game.
6714580	6718340	But I just, you know, with voice chat and everything, I don't need somebody joining
6718340	6721060	my game going, you know, F F F F.
6721060	6725220	Well, have we gotten like, can't you buy like big freighters and stuff like that in this
6725220	6726100	game now?
6726100	6727700	I haven't gotten that far yet.
6727700	6728580	Cause that'd be cool.
6728580	6732340	I don't even have my fucking like warp drive to go to another universe built yet, but I'm
6732340	6733940	not in a hurry to leave my current universe.
6733940	6734900	You know what I mean?
6734900	6736740	That's kind of go back and play.
6736740	6739540	You should, if you bought the game, check it out with the update.
6739540	6740580	You don't have to pay for it.
6740580	6742660	So then you downloaded it again.
6742660	6744660	I know I downloaded it again when I got my new system.
6744660	6746420	It's a nine gig update though.
6746420	6747380	Be careful.
6747380	6748420	It's going to take you a time.
6749060	6749460	All right.
6749460	6750820	Oh, well, my games already update.
6750820	6753540	They update, um, cause I keep everything in sleep mode.
6753540	6754740	So it updates automatically.
6754740	6755140	Oh, good.
6755140	6758420	So when I go in there, uh, Bobby does point out if you're joining, if they're joining
6758420	6759860	your game, you can mute and kick them.
6759860	6761060	Oh, that's good to know about trolls.
6761140	6765220	Uh, watch out though, a PlayStation four, if you haven't played it in a while, PS4 won't
6765220	6766100	keep updating it.
6766100	6769700	So if you haven't launched it in like over two months, PS4 is not going to update it
6769700	6770340	automatically.
6770340	6771780	Well, I just downloaded it again.
6771780	6775140	So I would think it would try to then, then you should be fine.
6775140	6777940	I mean, it wasn't like this week that I downloaded.
6777940	6779940	I downloaded it a couple of weeks ago.
6779940	6780820	Uh, you should be fine.
6780820	6782340	I think it was in the last 30 or 60 days.
6782340	6782900	Should be fine.
6783460	6783620	All right.
6783620	6786260	Anyway, uh, do that was it for the mailbag.
6786260	6787380	Thank you very much for the email.
6787380	6787940	Appreciate that.
6788020	6792180	And again, if you guys want to email us in a future week, participate at orange lounge
6792180	6794340	radio.com is the place to send those emails.
6794340	6796980	In the meantime, we have a few more stories for you guys that we're going to open up the
6796980	6801140	Skype line at orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype, but first Loki.
6801140	6808500	So apparently a hacker that was, um, he was arrested for cracking de Novo's anti pirate,
6809300	6810900	um, piracy software.
6811700	6822660	So apparently there, this guy in Bulgaria named, um, boxy, he broke through, I guess
6822660	6828740	the, their cracking, um, software and was able to crack de Novo.
6828740	6831780	And so with that, I guess I got him a little bit of attention.
6831780	6838340	And so he has been arrested and basically said it finally happened.
6838340	6840180	I can't say it wasn't expected.
6841460	6845620	Police came yesterday and took the server PC and my personal PC.
6845620	6848660	I had to go to the police afterwards and explain myself.
6848660	6849160	Wow.
6850500	6858020	Apparently they said, you know, that the parent company of de Novo, um, or or dito.
6858820	6864420	And I guess the Bulgarian cyber crime units, uh, were, had an investigation into him and
6864420	6869140	says, uh, the swift action of the Bulgarian police on this matter shows that the power
6869140	6873460	of collaboration between law enforcement and technology providers and that piracy is
6873460	6876180	a serious offense that will be acted upon.
6877700	6882580	Well, I mean, congratulations.
6882580	6886580	You caught somebody, but I, it's not going to stop hackers going to hack.
6886580	6887300	It doesn't matter.
6887300	6891540	Yeah, it's still, and especially if this is not popular, which I pretty sure de Novo is
6891540	6893060	not very popular from what I've heard.
6893060	6894820	Uh, it's probably not going to stop it.
6894820	6897220	I'm not, I'm not defending piracy.
6897220	6901060	Like again, you know, like if you like something, you should pay money for it.
6901060	6906820	And anti-piracy methods like this do suck when it affects the performance of the game.
6906820	6907140	Right.
6907140	6910980	When the anti-piracy gets too fucking out of hand though, I understand why people want
6910980	6912340	to be able to just disable it.
6912340	6912900	You know what I mean?
6913700	6916900	I miss the days of just having to look something up in page four of the manual.
6917860	6919380	Give me the code on page four.
6919940	6920500	All right.
6920500	6922100	We all know why that doesn't really work though.
6922980	6923540	All right.
6923540	6925140	Because you could photocopy that stuff?
6925140	6926500	Uh, some of them you couldn't.
6926500	6930500	I remember when they started printing them on like that red paper that you can't photocopy,
6930500	6932420	but now they just need PDF it.
6932420	6933940	Now you can scan it.
6933940	6935460	There's so much stuff you can do anyway.
6936100	6937300	Uh, moving on.
6937300	6940980	I know we don't usually talk about sports games on the show, but I think this one was
6940980	6944660	worth noting because this is, it's one of those things where you go, wow, they're finally
6944660	6945940	doing this in 2018.
6945940	6948260	It seems like this should have been something that happened a lot sooner.
6948260	6954100	But, uh, the newest, uh, EA basketball game that's on its way out, NBA live at 19, EA
6954100	6958820	has announced that, uh, you will be able to make female characters in create a player
6958820	6963700	mode finally, which is interesting because if I remember right, they added the WNBA last
6963700	6964420	year.
6964420	6969060	So, I mean, that was good, but now you can finally make a female avatar if you want.
6969060	6974980	Cause they do, they do this whole, uh, like they do live run the one streets, world tour
6974980	6975700	live events.
6975700	6977860	They do a lot of like street basketball.
6977860	6980100	Like it's not all like just playing stuff in an arena, right?
6980100	6981620	You do a lot of like street basketball and stuff.
6981620	6983060	So why shouldn't you know?
6983060	6987140	Well, I mean, honestly, in any of it, you should be able to play a woman, but I understand
6987140	6992020	that unfortunately the NBA doesn't totally reflect that now that women are like fully
6992020	6996020	integrated in that they have the two separate leagues, but that's a whole nother Oprah.
6996020	6998820	But at least for like some of like the street ball and the stuff where it's just like, you
6998820	7001700	know, friends playing a game together, you can do whatever you want.
7001700	7002740	So that's pretty cool.
7002740	7003060	Yeah.
7003060	7004260	So yeah, very cool.
7004260	7010180	Um, also the new trailer that kind of showcases this, they actually got Candace Parker from
7010180	7012660	the Los Angeles Sparks to kind of be in the trailer.
7012660	7016820	So they're, you know, trying to get, um, um, you know, some of the, some of the WNBA a
7016820	7018580	little more involved with it, which is pretty cool.
7018580	7022180	And I, I think this story popped up in our discord server, which if you're not on our
7022180	7025140	discord, you should check that out over at vog network.com slash discord.
7025140	7026660	We'll get the invite for you.
7026660	7029780	Um, and, uh, I think it came up when the story was posted.
7029780	7033940	I said, yeah, I mean, I, I, and I've said this before on the show, I was a fan of the
7033940	7034820	WNBA.
7034820	7037620	I say was because we had a team here in Sacramento.
7037620	7038420	Now we don't anymore.
7038420	7040500	And it's like, it's not the same thing.
7040580	7042260	We don't have like hometown games to go to.
7042260	7043700	Sadly, I miss it.
7044340	7044980	Anyway.
7044980	7047620	Uh, looking in chat at live.vog network.com.
7047620	7051460	SSJ 100 map points out NHL also lets you make him play as women in the game.
7051460	7052260	Yup.
7052260	7053540	Uh, let's see.
7053540	7058100	And, uh, dark Tetsuya says, I just thought this was a really cool story.
7058100	7061380	Although NBA hang time does have it beat by about 20 years.
7061380	7065060	It also had create a player mode and buried it amongst the normal male heads and weird
7065060	7065940	costume heads.
7065940	7067380	There are a couple of female heads you could pick.
7067940	7068740	So pretty cool.
7069380	7069780	All right.
7069780	7070900	Anyhow, let's move on.
7070900	7072900	Um, the next story was for dark soccer.
7072900	7074100	Maybe you can cover it, Logan.
7074100	7074420	Sure.
7074420	7074900	Yeah.
7074900	7081780	Um, so Castlevania season two is coming to Netflix on October 26th and they had a pretty
7081780	7087060	cool trailer for that, but that's not all because a third season is already in the works
7087060	7088500	and should be coming.
7088500	7090340	Well, I'm assuming afterwards.
7090340	7093060	Um, I still have yet to watch the first season.
7093060	7094420	It was on my thing.
7094420	7094660	Yeah.
7094660	7099060	I wanted to, and I just didn't get around to it, but the second season looks awesome.
7099060	7104100	And I guess I have some time to binge that, but, um, yeah, it looks pretty.
7104100	7105460	No, I still need to watch it too.
7105460	7106420	I'm so bad.
7106420	7107300	It looks good.
7107300	7107620	Yeah.
7107620	7112580	I mean, so I'm, I'm interested to check it out and obviously it's popular.
7112580	7114100	You know, we're getting in a third season.
7114660	7114900	Yeah.
7114900	7117940	I haven't really heard negative stuff about it, so I think it's being pretty well received.
7117940	7118740	So that's cool.
7118740	7119220	Yeah.
7119220	7119860	All right.
7119860	7121140	So can't wait.
7121140	7121620	All right.
7121620	7122100	All right.
7122100	7128180	And then something that I didn't necessarily ask for, but it's coming is a forsaken.
7128180	7133700	A HD remake of forsaken 20 years after the game came out.
7133700	7138980	So night dive studios, they were a developer that, um, I guess did HD updates for Turok
7138980	7139940	and Turok 2.
7140740	7142500	They're going to be doing this as well.
7143140	7147060	Forsaken was kind of a, it looked like a descent type game.
7147060	7153540	Um, basically, you know, they're going to be updating it with, you know, 60 FPS.
7153540	7156340	And of course, you know, higher resolution textures.
7156340	7160580	Although, I mean, this is a game that came out on place, the original PlayStation, Nintendo
7160580	7161140	64.
7161140	7164100	So it is a little bit, you know, low poly and that type of stuff.
7164100	7165780	But it's interesting.
7165780	7170820	I did watch the actual, um, trailer for it, but I don't know.
7170820	7173700	Um, and it's actually coming out very soon.
7173700	7177300	It's going to be launching on, uh, July 31st.
7177860	7181780	So right around the corner, a couple of days if you're interested.
7181780	7183300	And that's on Xbox one and PC.
7185540	7185940	All right.
7185940	7188500	Was that the one that had the commercials that were like the future's forsaken?
7188500	7189220	Was that that game?
7189220	7189540	Yes.
7189540	7190100	Oh, my God.
7190100	7191140	I remember that.
7191140	7191780	All right.
7191780	7193940	Uh, anyway, one more story for you guys.
7193940	7195300	Then we're going to open up the Skype line.
7195300	7196420	So get ready to give us a call.
7196420	7198660	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7198660	7202740	And, uh, oh, gosh, you knew if you saw this story, you just knew we were saving the best
7202740	7203460	for last.
7203460	7204100	That's right.
7204100	7207860	There is a porn, a Fortnite coming.
7207860	7209780	A Fortnite porn parody.
7209780	7211140	And you know what the game is?
7211140	7211940	Excuse the game.
7211940	7213700	You know what the porn parody is called?
7214340	7214820	I'm sorry.
7214900	7217140	I just laugh just looking at it on the screen.
7217140	7217860	You ready?
7217860	7220420	Loki, what would you call porn parody of Fortnite?
7220420	7221060	Fortnite?
7221860	7224820	Um, you would think fuck night, right?
7224820	7225460	Or something like that, right?
7225460	7225940	Yeah.
7225940	7227780	No, it's called Fortnut.
7231780	7232980	That's stupid.
7234500	7239220	It's a joint production between Wood Rocket and Pornhub.
7239220	7243460	And I guess these people that are in this porn parody are semi-famous.
7243460	7244180	Sure.
7244180	7248100	And, uh, they have like a little colorful little thing going on here with this whole
7248100	7248660	thing.
7248660	7250900	Anyway, there's an NSFW trailer.
7250900	7253220	If you want to look it up on YouTube, I'm not going to play it here.
7253220	7255060	You can look it up on your own if you want.
7255060	7256820	Uh, so check it out.
7256820	7261460	Uh, and I guess there's a, one of the jokes goes, we need to find a chest.
7261460	7264500	And then the, uh, camera zooms in on the boobs.
7264500	7266260	So that's, you know, high brow humor.
7266260	7266980	That's right.
7266980	7267940	That's right.
7267940	7269540	Anyway, uh, you can check that out.
7269540	7271140	I'm sure Pornhub has that available.
7271140	7277540	If you are interested in Fortnut, Fortnut, stupid.
7277540	7278660	I watched the trailer.
7278660	7280500	It was absolutely fucking terrible.
7281060	7285620	Like it was like, it was like a parody of what porn parodies are.
7285620	7290100	I mean, it's just, you're like, wow, that's some shit dialogue.
7290100	7292180	Like just not even trying.
7292180	7293940	It's just like, fuck it.
7293940	7294820	You know, whatever.
7295940	7296420	All right.
7296420	7299220	Uh, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7299220	7302660	If you would like to give us a call tonight to talk about anything we've talked about
7302660	7304580	or maybe have something else on the brain.
7304580	7304980	I don't know.
7304980	7307220	Anyway, the Skype line is open.
7307220	7311140	And while we wait for somebody to maybe drop in on the Skype line, let me check if there's
7311140	7311940	any last minute stories.
7311940	7313700	I do have a last minute story.
7313700	7314740	It's amazing.
7315300	7320660	So there was a game that was created by Lucas arts not too long.
7320660	7323460	Well, actually it was pretty long ago called day of the tentacle.
7323460	7323940	Oh shit.
7323940	7324420	Yeah.
7324420	7328340	So there's a fan game now that is a sequel to that.
7329780	7335380	Call return of the tentacle and you can play it for free so you can check it out actually
7335380	7338500	at Katmik or Katmik.
7338500	7346180	It's C A T M I C dot itch dot IO slash return dash of dash the dash tentacle.
7346900	7352100	And it is basically done in the style of the original point and click game.
7352660	7358500	And obviously the voice acting is kind of mimicked a little bit, but it's interesting.
7359300	7364500	So I downloaded it before the cease and desist hits, but definitely go check it out because
7365860	7367940	I mean, I love those Lucas arts games.
7367940	7368440	Yeah.
7370020	7374020	Didn't they do like a modern remake of day of the tentacle a little bit ago?
7374020	7374180	Right.
7374180	7377460	Because I remember the one for the 80s and then they did like a newer one a few years.
7377460	7377620	Yeah.
7377620	7379380	The newer one was the day of the tentacle.
7379380	7379860	Yeah.
7379860	7381300	They updated the HD one.
7381300	7383220	This is done in the style of the HD one.
7383220	7383460	Okay.
7383460	7383700	Got it.
7383700	7385220	So it's still the point.
7385220	7386500	And it's all maniac mansion.
7386500	7389060	It's all maniac mansion and guest characters.
7389700	7393380	There's there's cameos from other stuff in there too.
7393380	7393940	Okay.
7393940	7394900	So cool.
7394900	7395400	Yeah.
7395860	7396180	Definitely.
7396180	7396900	We're checking it.
7396900	7397780	Be looking forward to that.
7397780	7399220	I will have to play it.
7399220	7399620	All right.
7399620	7400660	I will have to as well.
7401300	7401800	Okay.
7402260	7405060	Well, I think, uh, I guess we're going to go ahead and wrap up.
7405060	7407220	Um, because I'm, I'm also, I'm so tired.
7407220	7408100	I'm really so exhausted.
7408100	7408580	I'm ready.
7408580	7410820	I'm ready to just vegetate a little bit.
7410820	7411860	I'm sure y'all understand.
7412420	7416340	But we'll be back, uh, next week to do it all over again in about seven days.
7416340	7418180	Uh, as I always say at the end of every episode,
7418180	7421380	if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, uh, please tell a friend or
7421380	7424580	two about the show, uh, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer
7424580	7428900	has a voice, but only if the voices are here to actually air them.
7428900	7434820	Uh, so, uh, you can also, uh, send us an email, participate at orange lounge radio.com.
7434820	7438820	And, um, you can, uh, you know, you can tweet us at OLR.
7438820	7442660	You can join our discord vog network.com slash discord.
7442660	7446260	Um, I guess that's, that's where I get to everybody's final thoughts.
7446260	7449140	So Loki, what's your final thought?
7449140	7453780	My final thought is I'm going to be still working on games in unreal.
7453780	7460020	Now I'm checking it out and seeing how that goes on my spawner screwed right now.
7460020	7462180	And we're just following along with the lesson.
7462180	7463700	So I don't really feel like I'm creating too much.
7463700	7465940	Although I did like adapt some of it too.
7466740	7470180	It's just, and the gut, the artwork that's there is provided by somebody else.
7470180	7471140	So it's not that great.
7471140	7475540	I kind of redo everything from scratch, which is more of a learning something and learning
7475540	7477620	how unreal works and everything.
7477620	7483060	So I'm looking forward to seeing how, uh, so that works cause it, I don't know.
7484180	7489380	I'll make my own thing later, but it I'm just making this, going through this lesson.
7490340	7491220	All right.
7491220	7497220	And, uh, my final thought tonight is, um, I'm, I'm ready to just go.
7497220	7500260	I actually, I need to take a little bit of a walk to get some steps in and get,
7500260	7504820	I haven't sent any pokey gifts today and Loki and I are about to become three star friends.
7505060	7508020	Like today, that's, that's a 50,000 experience bonus.
7508020	7509940	Uh, I actually hit three stars.
7509940	7511220	I hit three stars with a few people.
7511220	7512580	So it is 50,000?
7512580	7514180	It's 50,000 XP.
7514180	7516500	Oh, so you know, what's funny is the egg works on that.
7516500	7517220	Yes, it does.
7517220	7519860	So I did that last time I got a hundred thousand from somebody.
7519860	7522020	And then I think best friends is a hundred.
7522020	7523620	The four stars is a hundred thousand.
7523620	7524020	I think.
7524020	7524340	Cool.
7524340	7525060	I heard that's what it is.
7525620	7527220	Obviously it takes a while to hit that.
7527220	7528660	It's like 90 days to hit that.
7528660	7534100	But, uh, my friend, uh, up in Toronto is pro is the one that every single day,
7534100	7536260	since it started, we've traded gifts.
7536260	7538260	And so I hit three stars with him first.
7538260	7540340	And then the very next day, like act deft.
7540340	7544340	And I think, uh, as 200 Matt, like at the same time, we hit three stars.
7544340	7548100	I've hit it with, um, act deft and with magma lemur.
7548660	7549460	Oh, cool.
7549460	7549860	Yes.
7549860	7550180	Yeah.
7550180	7550740	Neat.
7550740	7551300	All right.
7551300	7555620	Well, uh, I will try to get you a gift so we can hit three stars as well.
7555620	7556020	Anyway.
7556020	7557380	Um, that's it.
7557380	7558020	We're done.
