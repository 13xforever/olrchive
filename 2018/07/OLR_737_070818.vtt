03:47.660 --> 03:52.940
as well waterboarding people for all our reviews is bad that's right thank you to our chatters

03:52.940 --> 03:58.060
over at live.vog network.com didn't mean to cut off Loki's introduction where you can

03:58.060 --> 04:03.580
fascinating I went down water slide cut you off all the time but I I was I'm terribly

04:03.580 --> 04:07.500
I was terribly afraid of him because I didn't really at that time I wasn't really good at

04:07.500 --> 04:16.180
swimming and this was like old school like water slides I think it was was it I mean

04:16.180 --> 04:20.500
I don't know if his man Tika or it's the one that's next to like a campground I don't know

04:20.500 --> 04:26.140
I think it's a conquered had him right is that no I know you're right man Tika did have

04:26.140 --> 04:29.940
the slide park at one time and it's gone they tore it down years ago because it's a big

04:29.940 --> 04:35.160
deal they're getting one of those god damn it what's the it's a it's mostly on the east

04:35.160 --> 04:39.920
coast I don't think they have them here but the Wildwood the wild great wilds something

04:39.920 --> 04:44.400
there's like these giant hotels slash water park they somebody in chattel know what I'm talking

04:44.400 --> 04:48.080
about because it's it's just not local here in California but we're going to get one they're

04:48.080 --> 04:53.960
putting it Bobby says wet and wild but that's a makeup but yeah so anyway this it's it's it was

04:53.960 --> 04:58.520
on an episode of undercover boss like I remember seeing that like most of the slides now they have

04:58.520 --> 05:04.600
you that you go down you go down you know sitting down you know feet first and you know you're like

05:04.600 --> 05:10.480
in a raft or something like that these you have to go down headfirst and headfirst great for someone

05:10.480 --> 05:16.440
who doesn't know how to swim not exactly the best thing in the world so I kind of had a bad

05:16.440 --> 05:22.000
experience with water slides but they look fun now just some of the ones that they have it like

05:22.000 --> 05:26.920
golf land or something like that I'm not fucking doing that I'm not fucking doing that all sit in

05:26.920 --> 05:31.760
the lazy river and go around a million times but I'm not fucking doing that that's that's it by the

05:31.800 --> 05:36.600
great Wolf Lodge or as they call it in Atlanta the great Bobby Black Wolf Lodge that's what they call

05:36.600 --> 05:43.520
it well when I grew up in well I didn't grow up there I was born in Dothan Alabama and I'd go

05:43.520 --> 05:49.440
visit in the summer but they actually had a very small little water park in Dothan Alabama that

05:49.440 --> 05:53.960
was just called water world yeah they have a water world at Cal Expo I don't I don't even know if

05:53.960 --> 05:59.480
they still run it ever cuz I don't I don't know if it would be safe like a lot of the plastic parts

05:59.480 --> 06:05.280
are probably still from 1965 raging waters now so somebody's actually put money into it I hope

06:05.280 --> 06:11.000
when when I was a kid though right outside Mobile like further down there was Styx River water world

06:11.000 --> 06:16.160
and they had like the rope swing that you'd hold on the rope and then let go over the water and

06:16.160 --> 06:22.040
they had like the slides that would dump you into like a 16-foot deep pool using action park all

06:22.040 --> 06:28.240
over like yours like you're sliding off of a cliff and they had you know this one thing that was like

06:28.240 --> 06:33.520
as tall as a big rollercoaster dip and you just slide down at top speed but that place went way

06:33.520 --> 06:40.840
out of business and there was a guy who goes by Adam the Wu on YouTube who sneaks into old

06:40.840 --> 06:45.520
amusement parks and everything and he found what was left of Styx River water world it was actually

06:45.520 --> 06:52.240
pretty sad but yeah anyway video games yeah video games let's get into our kickoff topic tonight

06:52.240 --> 06:56.680
which which I'm gonna surprise you guys with because on the show it's TBD because I could

06:57.080 --> 07:02.360
let's be real it was a dead week it's been a slower week because it was the 4th of July

07:02.360 --> 07:08.200
holiday week in the u.s. I know I wished everybody a happy Canada Day on the last show so now we need

07:08.200 --> 07:12.200
to focus on our own country for a minute even though I know the state of affairs is always

07:12.200 --> 07:20.000
whatever but you know what it's it's still my country god damn it so I what America is a

07:20.000 --> 07:31.360
fantastic place where a gay guy a woman who is gonna flaunt her 40 year old bikini bod and an

07:31.360 --> 07:38.000
angry cishet white male can get together and bitch about video games every week and that is

07:38.000 --> 07:42.720
what makes this country great don't forget I'm a part-time drag nun oh yeah okay thank you part

07:42.720 --> 07:48.280
time drag none perfect yeah so anyway I hope you all had a happy fourth of our drag none

07:48.280 --> 07:55.740
you're full of funnies tonight stop it sorry so anyway so the 4th of July and I hope you all had

07:55.740 --> 08:02.480
a good one was this week and so you know how I spent my 4th of July I spent my 4th of July in

08:02.480 --> 08:08.320
the most American way I possibly could my branch my personal gay brunch not just brunch girl gay

08:08.320 --> 08:13.920
brunch gay brunch and I know some of you I'm out there who don't know might be like what's the

08:13.920 --> 08:23.760
difference and I got two words for you bottomless mimosas it's gay anyway so what was I gonna say

08:23.760 --> 08:28.080
about the fourth oh yeah it's it's caused the week to be slow news week because I don't know

08:28.080 --> 08:33.160
about your day jobs but I know in my day job yet so many people that took vacation either the entire

08:33.160 --> 08:36.200
week at the front week so the same thing's happening in the gaming industry let's not

08:36.200 --> 08:41.800
forget this is people's jobs a lot of these places that they make video games office buildings so a

08:41.800 --> 08:48.080
lot of them yes it was slow like in fact I saw an article from I'm sure it was a Gawker site or

08:48.080 --> 08:56.160
whatever they are now saying which Mario Kart 64 character sounds the horniest I mean like what

08:56.160 --> 09:05.360
the hell is this bullshit I mean like this is like God why gaming media like just if you don't have

09:05.360 --> 09:11.080
anything to report just a report anything who was it toadette it was it was Jezebel oh oh wait

09:11.080 --> 09:16.520

09:16.520 --> 09:23.920
but oh oh I just saw the headline I'm like no you're gonna bring us all right fine I will go

09:23.920 --> 09:29.560
onto the internet and go look at who they think sounds the horniest fucking drop a tease like

09:29.560 --> 09:34.880
that which Mario Kart character is the horniest and not tell me who it is I mean I realize it's

09:34.920 --> 09:40.880
all bullshit and it doesn't matter but on a slow Newsweek anyway weren't you gonna say something

09:40.880 --> 09:46.560
to our soccer and weren't you gonna bring some class into this no but a friend of mine gave me

09:46.560 --> 09:51.560

09:51.560 --> 09:56.000

09:56.000 --> 10:00.520

10:41.160 --> 10:46.280
I wanted to talk about and I opened this up to our chat room as well live dot vog network comm this

10:46.280 --> 10:50.320
isn't a topical topic this is a this is a we talk about this anytime but I'm doing it tonight on a

10:50.360 --> 10:59.120
slower news week what is a video game that you might be a little bit embarrassed or shy or skittish

10:59.120 --> 11:07.520
to admit that you play or have played previously so what is a video game where you know and I want

11:07.520 --> 11:13.000
this to be a judgment-free shame-free zone tonight okay this is a this is a safe space for you to

11:13.000 --> 11:22.000
confess to Uncle Rob and Aunt Jamie and Crazy Loki what video game you you've been embarrassed to

11:22.000 --> 11:26.440
maybe be like super into maybe something you've like actually spent money on if it's like a mobile

11:26.440 --> 11:32.880
game or something and you're gonna confess tonight what game that is now for me there's a new game

11:32.880 --> 11:38.280
that I got into that I'm kind of embarrassed that I've been playing as much as I have and it is Aria

11:38.280 --> 11:42.320
snark's fault for those of you that remember shaking and crying yes as you playing Harry

11:42.320 --> 11:46.400
Potter yes it's gonna come back with new episodes no it's not Harry Potter because I'm all about

11:46.400 --> 11:51.920
the Harry Potter Niantic game when that happens I could care less about the story driven one they've

11:51.920 --> 11:56.920
already put I need to get back into that so the game that she got me into that I'm like kind of

11:56.920 --> 12:04.960
embarrassed to say that I'm playing Disney emoji blitz it's a match three game with little Disney

12:04.960 --> 12:10.240
characters that are like emojis and as you unlock them in the game through like the Tsum Tsum faces

12:10.240 --> 12:15.400
it's almost exactly like Tsum Tsum I think I feel like it's Americanized Tsum Tsum it's very very

12:15.400 --> 12:22.000
similar and as you get the emojis in the game you can use them like in your like texting and

12:22.000 --> 12:26.800
you're chatting in your app and all that stuff I need to play that all right but I'm kind of

12:26.800 --> 12:33.360
embarrassed because it's a stupid-ass match three game it's Disney and thankfully I haven't a given

12:33.360 --> 12:39.160
money yet but I thought about it I have watched videos to get currency which is like the first

12:39.200 --> 12:44.520
step I think so I don't know Loki is there any is there any video game where you're like a little

12:44.520 --> 12:49.280
bit embarrassed that you you're playing it or you've played it and I look at our chat over at

12:49.280 --> 12:59.640
live.vog network.com where she Hulk says Star Wars Battlefront 2 zing I can't think of anything off

12:59.640 --> 13:03.960
the top of my head that I'm embarrassed to be playing I mean I guess I I now really play the

13:03.960 --> 13:12.200
office space game that much anymore but me Para Para Paradise oh yeah sure cuz it's you know the

13:12.200 --> 13:17.000
dancing in that game is a little bit ridiculous you know yeah it's a little ridiculous I mean I

13:17.000 --> 13:21.680
just like the music from it but I had that's probably in that I'm not really that embarrassed

13:21.680 --> 13:26.200
by it I can't really think of anything like oh my god you know I can't believe I play there's nothing

13:26.200 --> 13:29.960
that you've done for the kids on their behalf I would have thought that would have been maybe

13:29.960 --> 13:34.480
where your answer was rooted no cuz I played like the games we play I still like playing so

13:34.480 --> 13:40.000
I don't know act deft and chat says I don't give a fuck what people think about the games I'm

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
playing and you shouldn't at the end of the day but come on there's got to be something where

13:44.000 --> 13:47.400
you've always been a little bit like I can't believe I'm playing this I can't believe this

13:47.400 --> 13:52.520
is how I'm choosing to spend my free time like I think we've all had that moment of self-doubt even

13:52.520 --> 13:58.560
at the end of the day you know I don't know I saw an advertisement also on Kotaku about a

13:59.480 --> 14:07.600
a hentai Tomogachi type game where you basically raise your girlfriends and then that would be

14:07.600 --> 14:13.960
kind of embarrassing the play I haven't played it yet but that would be embarrassing dark soccer

14:13.960 --> 14:18.120
anything that comes to mind for you not really really I've never been embarrassed by anything

14:18.120 --> 14:24.160
I've played I've I've had regretful purchases okay or like that one time that we rented WCW

14:24.160 --> 14:28.840
thunder and then took it back because it was bad all right at least we're getting warmer and then

14:28.840 --> 14:34.680
spice world I mean I wasn't embarrassed by that I tried to like it and it just didn't play very

14:34.680 --> 14:42.760
well like I used to play gals panic a lot you did I still love gals man I remember that so like in

14:42.760 --> 14:49.520
you miss world new 96 I mean we've played that all the time I'm not embarrassed by that so there's

14:49.520 --> 14:54.800
really not much I could think of that would be embarrassing them I mean can't imagine maybe

14:54.800 --> 14:58.600
not phrasing the question the right way I'm not saying maybe if there's like you know like a

14:58.600 --> 15:06.720
super homoerotic like version of this nude world 90 miss mr. mr. nude world 96 or something like

15:06.720 --> 15:10.520
that yeah and I was like really into that then maybe that might be slightly embarrassing but I

15:10.520 --> 15:16.040
can't think of anything that I've I've played that'd be really embarrassed by do you mean

15:16.600 --> 15:24.240
pleasure what about even the fact that you played the guy game that was hilarious it was there it's

15:24.240 --> 15:30.240
a trivia game with boobs it's awesome really they should have despite the fact that there was an

15:30.240 --> 15:35.800
underage girl in it that's most unfortunate just I don't know all that all those girls gone wild

15:35.800 --> 15:43.440
girls are over 18 we assume that but you know what it's a fantasy game it's not my job to you

15:43.440 --> 15:48.240
police the girls that are in that game it's the job of the game developers to do that I remember

15:48.240 --> 15:52.200
back in the day when you were going through all that and you you and the wife would do that but

15:52.200 --> 16:00.280
one point you found a like guys gone wild type of video for the misses and me to watch oh yeah yeah

16:00.280 --> 16:05.920
we used to get those at work yeah yeah so I just that's right I was in a bar last night that had

16:05.920 --> 16:13.000
gay porn up yeah I was hilarious to be fair to Loki he's always been very like you know I just

16:13.600 --> 16:20.040
making sure everybody is having an equally embarrassing time let's see guys you know what

16:20.040 --> 16:25.480
chat says I rented the Spice Girls video game from blockbuster almost every Friday it was

16:25.480 --> 16:30.360
embarrassing but I had to play it let me see if you remember this phrase guys you know let's put

16:30.360 --> 16:36.640
another girl through her paces because that was the game you would make the Spice Girls say no

16:36.640 --> 16:42.360
that that doesn't sound creepy without it was super creepy I just remember it was really funny

16:42.400 --> 16:46.720
because like we would have the Spice Girls like they would all do like a super coordinated routine

16:46.720 --> 16:51.240
and then we'd have baby Spice just stand there and wave the whole time because she's the dumb one

16:51.240 --> 16:58.720
and I think we had one where Sporty Spice just did a backflip over and over and over again like

16:58.720 --> 17:06.600
she's gonna give herself vertigo let's see um act-def says my what am I playing this game would

17:06.600 --> 17:12.880
be sonic forces this week but I'm having fun with it because of how bad it is there you go

17:12.880 --> 17:19.040
there you go that's a good answer a video game that was so bad it was good okay here we go from

17:19.040 --> 17:24.720
s2100 Matt I like this story I don't have a video game in mind but I really wanted to play the mall

17:24.720 --> 17:31.040
madness board game as a kid I don't really know why maybe I thought the board looked cool my mom

17:31.040 --> 17:35.360
wouldn't get it because it was a girls game I finally played it when I went to a friend's

17:35.360 --> 17:39.160
house and it was all that as you and her Matt here's the thing here's the thing it had that

17:39.160 --> 17:44.120
cool little like robot voice that would tell you like sale happening and like it worked with all

17:44.120 --> 17:50.480
the fake credit cards and all this shit like it was like for a quote-unquote girls game it was

17:50.480 --> 17:56.120
super electronics not that I'm saying girls can't be into the electronics but the day and age when

17:56.120 --> 18:00.160
we grew up was a little bit different when you you know kind of had your boy games in your girls

18:00.160 --> 18:04.440
game right so the fact that you know there was a lot of electronics involved in the girls game I

18:04.440 --> 18:10.000
think made a lot of us boys kind of you know that we're into that stuff want to play it see I I

18:10.000 --> 18:15.040
always wanted transformers when I was a kid fucking love transformers nothing wrong with that my mom

18:15.040 --> 18:22.320
wouldn't buy me transformers because they were for boys so out of spite as an adult I bought

18:22.320 --> 18:27.320
because I had one transformer that she found that I hadn't got rid of and it was hot rod like for

18:27.320 --> 18:32.720
after the movie era so I now have like 12 why don't you say mom they're called transform hers

18:32.720 --> 18:39.360
I was a kid my snark wasn't quite up to snuff really cuz I remember that story about when she

18:39.360 --> 18:45.440
tried to take it in no way yeah that cuz she didn't buy it for me my snark was growing at

18:45.440 --> 18:50.960
that time that's just first level snark that's like common sense snark let's see Kai's you know

18:50.960 --> 18:55.280
in chat tell you about the Spice Girls game says I always wanted to be a music video director so

18:55.280 --> 19:00.760
it was the closest thing I had at the time play C&C music factory oh god those games were off the

19:00.760 --> 19:06.960
crisscross video I have those games were fucking rad although they really weren't games they really

19:06.960 --> 19:11.600
weren't that good they're just one of those like relics of the 90s let's see rage nator in chat

19:11.600 --> 19:17.000
says I tried playing WCW thunder once but once I discovered my mistake I flung holy water at it

19:17.000 --> 19:21.760
followed by bleach and gasoline all while yelling be gone Satan well that seems a little extreme

19:21.760 --> 19:27.440
local poco and chat says the Winnie the Pooh Gameboy color game that was a Mario Party knock

19:27.480 --> 19:32.880
off was my guilty pleasure it was just a board game no minigames and not very good but being

19:32.880 --> 19:39.840
Winnie the Pooh fan I liked it oh that's cute I know speaking of Disney stuff that I I'm almost

19:39.840 --> 19:45.680
a little ashamed to own I owned the you guys will remember this the jungle book dancing game they

19:45.680 --> 19:50.840
came out on PlayStation because it came with that dance pad I was one of the first the first time I

19:50.840 --> 19:56.360
actually went to your apartment yep was with that was the jungle book dance game and then one of our

19:56.360 --> 20:03.880
friends at the time who's since gone crazy he brought over the modded or the little no you

20:03.880 --> 20:09.480
brought the plug he brought the third mix I can play my run of third mix was that what it was I

20:09.480 --> 20:15.920
thought was why did I blame him for that anyway so I didn't but it was my my but we played DDR on

20:15.920 --> 20:21.440
like that tiny little dance pad and it was so much fun even though I lived upstairs so that I know

20:21.440 --> 20:26.840
that lady below hated me but you know what her gospel music woke me up at 6 a.m. on the weekend

20:26.840 --> 20:35.800
so fair's fair tbh so let's see going in chat at live at dot vog network comm Bobby Blackwell says

20:35.800 --> 20:40.960
I still have connectables armored and loco poco jungle book rhythm and groove that was it that

20:40.960 --> 20:47.040
was the name of it I love it actually kind of fun yeah it wasn't for a totally like American

20:47.040 --> 20:53.600
dance game that was kind of like right before DDR really took off it wasn't terrible anyway

20:53.600 --> 20:59.800
all right let's go from embarrassing stuff to new stuff what types of video games have

20:59.800 --> 21:04.360
you been playing this week in a segment we call how was your gaming week dark soccer

21:04.360 --> 21:09.920
how was your gaming week I'm playing Final Fantasy 5 of course I'm playing it on iOS

21:09.920 --> 21:15.840
because it's easy to take with me I I understand that I don't like what they did to it I resisted

21:15.840 --> 21:21.840
the urge to name him but but I love Final Fantasy 5 so I'm looking forward to playing it again

21:21.840 --> 21:26.880
because I don't remember all the plot points I love the music the music is amazing the music is

21:26.880 --> 21:32.080
really good we really missed out by not getting that here when we were kids I mean obviously it's

21:32.080 --> 21:40.140
very easy to find now but you know I'm playing Pokemon go because of reasons leveling has been

21:40.140 --> 21:52.820
quick now I actually haven't touched ingress in a while yeah that's it because I'm trying to get

21:52.820 --> 21:58.100
Dan to actually stay home long enough to play Kirby with me so still wanting to finish Kirby

21:58.100 --> 22:06.380
all right yeah Loki wait wait I bought a game okay I'm gonna stream okay and it's speed dating

22:06.380 --> 22:11.500

22:11.500 --> 22:16.460
well it's hilarious and I like we're dating Sims where did you find this steam I see cuz well of

22:16.460 --> 22:22.580

22:40.060 --> 22:46.540
actually getting things ready to start streaming off the the Vega Christmas in July though anyway

22:46.540 --> 22:53.180
all right Loki how was your gaming week I mean week was all right I managed to pick up an SNES

22:53.180 --> 23:00.060
classic after the show last week so I've had that been already modding it because it's super easy to

23:00.140 --> 23:05.340
do that and so I put a ton of games on there funny enough the games I've been playing so I

23:05.340 --> 23:13.140
I've played a little bit Star Fox just to unlock Star Fox 2 and then the other game that I've been

23:13.140 --> 23:21.900
playing just because my kids were into it was Mighty Morphin Power Rangers on the SNES and it's

23:21.900 --> 23:28.260
a beat-em-up game which says it's two players but it only if you put in a code and it's a stupid

23:28.540 --> 23:36.460
like versus mode thing it's really dumb so they have that so that's kind of misleading but whatever

23:36.460 --> 23:43.780
free is free so I'm not gonna complain yeah I've got like already other systems on there and stuff

23:43.780 --> 23:48.540
I mean it couldn't be any easier to put that shit together I mean it's ridiculous so I've been doing

23:48.540 --> 23:54.420
that Pokemon go just trying to keep up with sending gifts to everybody every day I've upgraded my

23:54.420 --> 24:05.860
inventory the whole 600 items now and I still that all amateur I know I'm 1400 item cap 1500

24:05.860 --> 24:12.220
Pokemon cap I got really excited when they said they were upping the cap to 2000 in my defense

24:12.220 --> 24:18.740
before y'all get judgy now that they've got this trading thing and distance comes into play with

24:18.740 --> 24:24.100
it it's like when I go to places like Atlanta and Chicago I want to hold on to every Pokemon I get

24:24.100 --> 24:29.220
there because I come come back here and trade it and you get like way more candy for that stuff so

24:29.220 --> 24:35.460
I mean like there's a special Pokemon in your yard that's Pikachu oh one of the little Pikachu's oh

24:35.460 --> 24:39.660
yeah yeah little summer Pikachu is gone everywhere everywhere yeah and if you guys don't didn't get

24:39.660 --> 24:46.260
any sunglasses squirtles today I have like 50 billion so I did I involved one I'll trade you

24:46.260 --> 24:52.700
one when we get a break during the show okay all right so anyway I have so many so many anyway

24:52.700 --> 25:00.460
anything else your game week Logie um that's it I also forgot to mention I think last week I have

25:00.460 --> 25:05.700
finally got my mod chip for my switch the issue is those I'm probably not gonna end up using it

25:05.700 --> 25:11.060
but I have it for a rainy day to look at whenever I decide to end up doing it because they have a

25:11.060 --> 25:15.980
real problem with people being banned online for using them which is makes sense because there's

25:15.980 --> 25:23.100
people doing all sorts of nonsense on there like spreading porn through their avatar pics and stuff

25:23.100 --> 25:27.420
like that when they do like the balloon hunt things and stuff like that so I'm just waiting

25:27.420 --> 25:31.940
for all that shit to die down and then maybe someday I'll get a second switch and just pirate

25:31.940 --> 25:39.460
the shit out of that but yeah I've got it now sitting in the bag in my case so all right but

25:39.460 --> 25:46.620
yeah SNES mini was most of my week all right then my game a week so first off I have a couple of

25:46.620 --> 25:51.460
housekeeping these I have to say first off happy birthday to my husband Alan today is Alan's 40th

25:51.460 --> 25:56.820
birthday yes my birthday my 40th was just two weeks ago his is today so he was he's July 8th

25:56.820 --> 26:02.900
baby so I say happy birthday to Alan if he's out there listening as as a belated birthday gift Alan

26:02.900 --> 26:10.580
got me a classic NES nice so he got me one of those right because after all the craziness from

26:10.580 --> 26:14.860
last year he the minute he saw one go up online he was like he didn't realize that they were kind

26:14.860 --> 26:19.140
of like being reprinted he thought he kind of like found something he's like whoa a classic NES

26:19.140 --> 26:25.300
at retail price with heck so he bought it so but you know what I'm still very happy haven't touched

26:25.300 --> 26:30.700
it at all this week unfortunately just like sadly I haven't touched your PlayStation VR that I really

26:30.700 --> 26:36.020
want to do it but I haven't really been able to play a lot of new games I've been very busy with

26:36.020 --> 26:42.580
the show prep for clue coming up at the end of the month so that's part of the reason but I did play

26:42.580 --> 26:47.540
I have played some of my old standbys so I've been still playing Heroes of the Storm quite a bit of

26:47.540 --> 26:52.780
Final Fantasy 14 this week as well because they put out the patch four three five which put in

26:52.780 --> 26:58.380
the new dungeon called heaven on high which is like a roulette kind of dungeon similar to the

26:58.380 --> 27:03.540
deep dungeon or palace of the dead from the last expansion so they did that I did a little bit of

27:03.540 --> 27:07.020
streaming of that the other actually no I don't think I actually did that dungeon I think I was

27:07.020 --> 27:12.340
playing some scholar trying to get my scholar ready to do that dungeon so I've been playing

27:12.340 --> 27:16.740
some of that quite a bit with some of my friends so that's been a big bulk of my gaming week so

27:16.740 --> 27:21.980
between that and Heroes of the Storm and overwatch a little bit as well it's still kind of trying to

27:21.980 --> 27:26.980
fool around with the Symmetra rework and trying to learn how to use her new teleporter effectively

27:27.020 --> 27:31.860
because like I was getting yelled at in one match because I wasn't really using the teleporter but

27:31.860 --> 27:36.140
like you know if you don't know the map super well like I was just I was just like sorry trying to

27:36.140 --> 27:41.620
get used to changes and they kind of backed off because it's quick play you can't expect everybody

27:41.620 --> 27:47.460
to be good and quick play but then I started using the teleporter and I got a bunch of what I call

27:47.460 --> 27:53.500
endorsements at the end of the match so I did kind of learn something so yeah so playing a little bit

27:53.540 --> 27:58.700
Overwatch and so forth Heroes of the Storm's been going really well too I unlocked two heroes out of

27:58.700 --> 28:05.260
loot boxes I got fucking ragnaros in a common loot box I was like blown away like a legendary

28:05.260 --> 28:09.400
hero and common loot box then I got Muradin when I hit level 75 so that's really cool that I'm

28:09.400 --> 28:14.380
unlocking the heroes and loot boxes and I don't know if it's still going this week but I know

28:14.380 --> 28:20.420
last week if you're watching people play Heroes of the Storm on Twitch then you have the potential

28:20.420 --> 28:25.220
to get loot boxes in the game so I've been watching some streamers on Twitch either the

28:25.220 --> 28:29.180
official heroes channel or I've been watching some of the other just you know regular people

28:29.180 --> 28:32.900
playing Heroes of the Storm and you know it's one of those things I'll have honest background noise

28:32.900 --> 28:38.460
while I'm doing other stuff but you know I'm kind of watching it the way I might watch certain TV

28:38.460 --> 28:47.020
shows so there you go anyway going to chat at live.vognetwork.com oh Bobby Black Wolf says at

28:47.060 --> 28:52.740
least Brob's beard is still magnificent oh yeah about that I know he knows already but yeah I

28:52.740 --> 28:57.060
shaved my beard this week too which is another pretty big step because we're doing the promo

28:57.060 --> 29:01.100
pictures for clue next week so I have to do because if you didn't I think I mentioned this

29:01.100 --> 29:07.700
on the last show we're doing a production of like a rocky horror style where the movie is on stage

29:07.700 --> 29:14.500
while it's playing on the screen I'm playing mrs. peacock mrs. peacock was a man that's the

29:14.500 --> 29:20.460
whole joke so I am playing mrs. peacock so I had to shave my face this week so that way because my

29:20.460 --> 29:25.540
face is all peely and gross makeup work for you yeah I haven't done the full test yet for ask me

29:25.540 --> 29:31.900
again on like Tuesday okay well like I'm sure it'll be fine I'm not worried it just exfoliate

29:31.900 --> 29:37.620
yeah for sure yeah otherwise I'm gonna get all these gross flakes all over the makeup but anyway

29:37.620 --> 29:43.660
you're not here for makeup chat you hear about video games and as far as housekeeping goes the

29:43.660 --> 29:49.660
next show we will not be here for his Labor Day weekend because I will be at Dragon Con in Atlanta

29:49.660 --> 29:53.500
as I have been for the past seven years so those of you that have been listening to all are there

29:53.500 --> 30:00.420
should be nothing new but what is new is hopefully some of the panels that myself Bobby black wolf

30:00.420 --> 30:07.140
and other vog network creators I know critical myth does a lot of that those guys including John

30:07.140 --> 30:12.340
and his co-host they do panels and they're there Brian from British invaders I don't know if he's

30:12.340 --> 30:16.380
going again this year he used to go every other year but he's been going more frequently but I

30:16.380 --> 30:21.500
know he does stuff with Brit track so and so on and I'm even trying to get extra for to go this

30:21.500 --> 30:26.060
year which is what'll be a lot of fun if we get him at Dragon Con so um yeah check it out it's

30:26.060 --> 30:32.020
gonna be a blast Dragon Con overlay every day we get let's get into some more gaming news and talk

30:32.020 --> 30:36.460
about what's been happening what little has been happening this week in gaming Loki so remember

30:36.460 --> 30:45.100
that valve kind of shut down access to the information that was being pulled from steam

30:45.100 --> 30:54.220
spy apparently though there was an issue where it wasn't up 100% dead they found a way to get some

30:54.220 --> 31:03.900
of the information and now they have finally closed off that bit of the service as well so

31:04.020 --> 31:13.500
they managed to look at I guess roughly they could estimate you I guess if based on achievements or

31:13.500 --> 31:17.620
something like that so now though that they have completely shut that down however they're gonna

31:17.620 --> 31:24.480
be introducing something new that's gonna take its place so that's kind of nice to be able to

31:24.480 --> 31:30.020
you give that information again but it's something that valve is gonna supply and I think the reason

31:30.020 --> 31:36.180
they shut down in the first place was due to certain privacy laws and whatnot just to comply

31:36.180 --> 31:41.980
with that so good to see that there'll be some sort of metric system coming in place of it but

31:41.980 --> 31:47.900
the only problem is it's on valve time and who knows when the fuck that's gonna happen so I

31:47.900 --> 31:55.980
guess we'll just have to wait and see how important I guess is this for people I mean

31:55.980 --> 31:59.700
wouldn't people that develop their games they know how many they're selling so this is other

31:59.700 --> 32:03.740
people to know how you're doing yeah I guess it's just the kind of measure different things to see

32:03.740 --> 32:11.340
how things are doing you know just to see how if you want to feel like getting that kind of data

32:11.340 --> 32:17.220
like with MPD group used to do something with new game sales and they kind of walk that back a bit

32:17.220 --> 32:21.660
as far as the details that were in that and so we had to use different sources to give that

32:21.660 --> 32:28.540
information and see if I was kind of that way of doing it but now that that's gone if we kind of

32:28.540 --> 32:35.300
have to trust you know these sources on the information they're providing this I guess so

32:35.300 --> 32:39.420
Bobby's lighting up the chat room at live dot vog network comm saying this was this was math

32:39.420 --> 32:46.020
Loki basically so the percentage amount of people who got an achievement was available to 16 decimal

32:46.020 --> 32:52.340
places that's precise that is very precise like honestly when it comes to pie you don't need that

32:52.340 --> 32:56.900
many decimal places to do some really good calculations right you three point one four is

32:56.900 --> 33:03.620
good enough but steam went to 16 decimal places so you could take the numbers find the common

33:03.620 --> 33:08.580
denominator figure out how many people got at least one achievement which correlates to how

33:08.580 --> 33:14.660
many sales you have but aren't there a lot of people and granted you know I'm I don't have this

33:14.660 --> 33:18.340
article sitting in front of me aren't there a lot of people who buy the game that don't get any

33:18.340 --> 33:23.740
achievements possibly but if you're just looking for who's playing the game I guess that's true

33:23.740 --> 33:27.220
because the percent you're you're never gonna get like a hundred percent never mind I get it I get

33:27.220 --> 33:33.460
it cuz you're 16 places okay never mind I kind of answer my own question in my head yeah so you

33:33.460 --> 33:38.900
just want to know who's playing the game yeah yeah and I know that they came up a list with like the

33:38.900 --> 33:45.220
top 1000 games or something of course Team Fortress 2 being number one of course but yeah

33:45.220 --> 33:52.940
it was interesting I can't see how everybody fell into place on that hmm all right well let's move

33:52.940 --> 33:59.700
on and talk about the potential for more switch titles coming in 2018 Nintendo will not let you

33:59.700 --> 34:04.300
know who got what to 16 decimal places because that would involve Nintendo going online but

34:04.340 --> 34:10.820
Nintendo may be providing new games by the end of the year the former now president of Nintendo

34:10.820 --> 34:16.700
Tatsumi Kimishima has talked about the Nintendo has other titles coming to the switch that have

34:16.700 --> 34:22.140
yet to be revealed this is what they're talking about Nintendo is going to disclose more

34:22.140 --> 34:26.940
information at an appropriate times that means a direct in a few months probably the lineup

34:26.940 --> 34:32.660
includes products that will be launched during the year-end shopping season it's not yet time

34:32.660 --> 34:37.260
to reveal the full lineup more games will be released before the end of the fiscal year which

34:37.260 --> 34:42.700
would mean early 2019 as well which that also makes it I would almost feel like more of that

34:42.700 --> 34:47.540
is gonna fall into this category because I feel like in fall we'll get a direct that talks about

34:47.540 --> 34:52.220
January February March anyway well there's still you know there's even like everyone forgets there's

34:52.220 --> 34:56.060
games comm still and you know even though there wasn't a lot of announcements from Sony in

34:56.060 --> 35:02.340
previous years games come has been a big portion of their announcements as well and there's Tokyo

35:02.340 --> 35:07.020
Game Show which yes I know Nintendo does not historically participate around that but they

35:07.020 --> 35:12.020
usually do stuff around that time anyway to kind of you know remain competitive I will point out

35:12.020 --> 35:18.300
Kimishima called the games a powerful lineup although that could be translation open a question

35:18.300 --> 35:23.260
there marketing speak yeah Nintendo does aim to maintain and expand the momentum of the switch

35:23.260 --> 35:27.500
towards the year-end shopping season which honestly I don't think they need a lot of help in

35:27.500 --> 35:32.460
doing if you think about it there's already a lot of great games on the switch sure more to

35:32.460 --> 35:36.620
sustain it's gonna be even better but you know somebody looking to get a switch right now can

35:36.620 --> 35:42.260
still look at there's Breath of the Wild Mario Kart 8 Mario Odyssey and soon there'll be Mario

35:42.260 --> 35:46.820
Party Smash Brothers like you know and that's really the tip of the iceberg if you think about

35:46.820 --> 35:50.820
it so I think the switch you know I'm not too worried about the switches lineup and how that's

35:50.820 --> 35:54.580
gonna sell through the holiday this year I think it's gonna do just fine I think it is interesting

35:54.820 --> 36:00.580
they're talking about unreleased stuff however there's a couple things I don't think this

36:00.580 --> 36:05.340
necessarily means we're talking about triple-a cartridge titles these could be download things

36:05.340 --> 36:10.740
in the style of NES remix right that was a pretty you know cool little title that they

36:10.740 --> 36:15.500
surprised I think we get me ports I'm thinking like maybe well still thinking about where's

36:15.500 --> 36:22.460
Mario maker hold on here's here's the big thing we still have not heard Nintendo's online plan

36:22.460 --> 36:31.420
so I'm that is true yeah assuming these games probably tie into that and it may be more than

36:31.420 --> 36:38.340
just the here's the 8-bit you know balloon fight or whatever you know games that they got oh

36:38.340 --> 36:41.740
actually they've announced the first 10 they did announce the first 10 didn't they I seem to

36:41.740 --> 36:45.060
remember that was an article from a few weeks ago so anyway we know some of the games that are gonna

36:45.060 --> 36:52.620
be coming but who's to say that it's limited to this subscription style thing wouldn't you think

36:52.620 --> 36:57.900
Nintendo is also going to use this opportunity to put out digital games that encourage online

36:57.900 --> 37:07.420
play that will also be available to purchase such as why not the dr. Mario remake that was on Wii U

37:07.420 --> 37:14.460
perfect example right why not bring that hey another Wii U port over to the switch you know

37:14.460 --> 37:20.660
what I mean so think along those lines what are some other games that are you know kind of you

37:20.660 --> 37:26.140
know smaller development team either remaster sports or they could be new online new simple

37:26.140 --> 37:32.220
online experiences again NES remix was a new concept in a way so what these titles could

37:32.220 --> 37:38.340
absolutely be a part of that so I would anticipate Nintendo is going to have a big online reveal in

37:38.340 --> 37:43.980
what September probably heading into October was October the month they said this is gonna finally

37:44.020 --> 37:49.340
go live so don't think you like one a month no they don't do directs once a month maybe every

37:49.340 --> 37:54.500
other month and some of them are minis so I would say September ish we'll get a direct that's gonna

37:54.500 --> 38:00.660
be a big like October blowout here's the online and it's the subscription and you're gonna be

38:00.660 --> 38:10.220
able to get this too and oh if you download Pokemon crystal you can send those Pokemon to

38:10.220 --> 38:14.020
new let's go actually that would make sense because the gen crossover so I guess it's gonna

38:14.020 --> 38:20.260
be Pokemon yellow yet again on your fucking switch now you can import some of these Pokemon into

38:20.260 --> 38:26.620
Pokemon let's go Pikachu and let's go Eevee there will be things like this that this is the kind of

38:26.620 --> 38:32.900
stuff that Nintendo is gonna DLC for Mario Odyssey or something like that yeah but then I can do that

38:32.900 --> 38:37.620
game of the year edition type thing I don't necessarily disagree but I think that is outside

38:37.620 --> 38:42.580
the scope of what Kimishima is referencing here because he's talking about other titles and so I

38:42.580 --> 38:49.940
think it's online shit I think they're gonna do a big online another Pikmin game maybe who knows

38:49.940 --> 38:57.380
who knows Bobby Blackwell says a wada did directs once a month that ended with him did were they

38:57.380 --> 39:01.300
really doing it that free I mean I don't I don't disagree I mean it does seem like they were doing

39:01.300 --> 39:06.340
it more frequently at one point and it's kind of scaled back because there was a big question mark

39:06.340 --> 39:10.780
for a while who's going to do these without a water around and I think you know everybody else

39:10.780 --> 39:17.660
around Nintendo's kind of stepped up to you know you got Reggie you got a Miyamoto you've got the

39:17.660 --> 39:22.620
treehouse crew you know they kind of they kind of fill in all those gaps and now that Nintendo has

39:22.620 --> 39:27.580
a permanent president because remember Kimishima was always meant to be temporary now the Nintendo

39:27.580 --> 39:33.500
has a permanent president maybe he'll be the host of this first direct that they end up doing this

39:33.500 --> 39:39.580
fall who knows who knows anyway act Efton chat talking about the DLC for Odyssey says I would

39:39.580 --> 39:46.820
love DLC for Odyssey if that means more levels and stuff why not why not I wouldn't be surprised

39:46.820 --> 39:54.700
at all all right let's move on dark soccer yes well for fans who like anime and love their video

39:54.700 --> 39:59.540
games especially like animated things about their video games there are two things to be coming out

39:59.540 --> 40:07.660
number one Rob ingress the animation you know what's funny they announced that back in December

40:07.660 --> 40:13.380
like this action that is a new information it's where it's gonna be that's new information and

40:13.380 --> 40:17.220
some of this new art that they put out but they did they showed us a half second of the anime

40:17.220 --> 40:23.940
there's a little bit more though okay so it's supposed to be out according to hold on it's

40:23.940 --> 40:30.700
so that it was becoming it's a Netflix in October that's that's so the thing though is that it the

40:30.700 --> 40:37.860
art director for Evangelion Honda Takeshi is also involved in it and I'm really really looking

40:37.860 --> 40:42.500
forward to seeing what turns out about it because I mean the animation style looks amazing the

40:42.500 --> 40:47.980
premise behind it is also gonna play into ingress prime yeah so I think that's all pretty neat yeah

40:47.980 --> 40:52.380
I'm excited about not just because I play ingress like you know but ingress was always bigger in

40:52.380 --> 40:57.940
Japan than it was here that's why I rewatch the ingress prime trailer I don't know if it was a

40:57.940 --> 41:03.500
new trailer but they had an English prime trailer that I watched that trailer is so full of nothing

41:03.500 --> 41:10.260
like it's just like blah blah speak like this makes no fucking sense oh no no no sense go back

41:10.260 --> 41:15.060
and watch the original ingress reveal trailer and you'll be like that isn't the fucking game

41:15.060 --> 41:20.780
whatsoever but that's like the Pokemon go trailer anyway so in other news of course Castlevania has

41:20.780 --> 41:26.980
also been renewed for season two which I hope is more than you know what three episodes I think

41:26.980 --> 41:34.060
they said it's six good well I think eight episode sorry eight episodes um October 26 is when it is

41:34.060 --> 41:38.820
also going to be out so both on Netflix so it looks like Netflix is gonna have a good month

41:38.820 --> 41:45.140
to come October well they spent like 1 billion dollars on new properties so yeah I expect there's

41:45.140 --> 41:49.640
a lot of stuff coming to Netflix yeah hopefully more nailed it I'm really looking forward though

41:49.640 --> 41:55.120
because I really liked Castlevania especially when you had a lot of the tie-in on for its color

41:55.120 --> 42:00.560
palette to the NES games it really did sample I think a lot of the same colors that were used

42:00.560 --> 42:07.720
and it really was a great tie-in so there you go all right I I am not even that big of an anime

42:07.720 --> 42:12.320
person but I'm looking forward to these I will I'll have to ping Ranma for his opinion on the

42:12.320 --> 42:19.720
ingress and Castlevania stuff coming up anyway Loki what do you got so speaking of new announcements

42:19.720 --> 42:26.240
for the switch there's a port of warframe coming to the switch it's being developed by panic button

42:26.240 --> 42:32.480
who did the ports for doom and Wolfenstein the new Colossus and Rocket League they announced it

42:32.480 --> 42:38.920
during the TennoCon 2018 which apparently is a warframe convention me not being a participant

42:38.920 --> 42:43.560
of warframe I didn't even know they had conventions for it but I guess it is uber popular so it makes

42:43.560 --> 42:48.000
sense so we'll be coming to the switch they talked about that there may be some opportunities for

42:48.000 --> 42:55.120
cross-play to which I say how is PlayStation gonna fuck this up how are they not going to

42:55.120 --> 43:00.760
because warframes on PlayStation it's so how are they gonna fuck this up Loki it's it's not that

43:00.760 --> 43:06.440
complicated of a question I'll tell you how they're gonna fuck it up like go look at Fortnite there

43:06.440 --> 43:14.560
you go that's how they're gonna fuck it up kind of PlayStation sometimes I just I this is also

43:14.560 --> 43:19.680
an opportunity for Sony to get off their goddamn high horse so we'll see what happens get off or

43:19.680 --> 43:25.240
get knocked off I don't know if I'd go that far especially because warframes already existed it's

43:25.240 --> 43:31.480
not like this is a new thing anyway uh let's see dungeon buster by the way wanted to go look at

43:31.480 --> 43:36.680
the facts on the Nintendo Directs Bobby is on point sometimes there would be even more than

43:36.680 --> 43:42.360
one direct a month at the list of Nintendo Directs but I guess it's it's slowed down a little more as

43:42.360 --> 43:49.920
of late so anyway let's move on and talk a little bit about the Intellivision the new one not the

43:49.920 --> 43:53.880
old one I mean we could talk about the old one too we're talking about the new one Tommy Tallarico

43:53.880 --> 43:59.280
went on a podcast and talked a lot as has been known to happen and that's no shade at Tommy I

43:59.320 --> 44:03.640
love a person he's awesome I love a person that's passionate about their stuff but and the guy likes

44:03.640 --> 44:09.480
to talk he's been on a well are where he talked for half the show which is great he went on Bobby's

44:09.480 --> 44:15.480
show where he talked for over the show so it's great Tommy's great and he went on this other

44:15.480 --> 44:20.040
podcast called nerdable but they spell it in leet speak which is interesting choice that's a choice

44:20.040 --> 44:26.240
so he went on this podcast and talked about Intellivision and what all is gonna be expected

44:26.240 --> 44:33.280
on the new Intellivision and in very Tommy style here's the thing I don't want to compare Tommy to

44:33.280 --> 44:37.840
45 because that's a very rude thing to do to compare somebody who I really respect to somebody

44:37.840 --> 44:45.560
who well you can you can finish that sentence or but here's the thing sometimes when like you know

44:45.560 --> 44:51.960
the 45 talks about like things very bigly and hype some things up like a lot of it is hype and

44:51.960 --> 44:56.000
I worry that a lot of what I'm hearing in this interview is also a lot of that same

44:56.760 --> 45:01.680
hype and there's a part of me that wants to tell Tommy yo I'm so happy that you're passionate Tommy

45:01.680 --> 45:05.520
because we need lots of people like that in the industry especially people making the decisions

45:05.520 --> 45:12.920
but just don't over promise and under deliver that is the worst possible thing you can do

45:12.920 --> 45:21.520
don't be a clique a chameleon oh yeah well yes that too anyway and here's the one here's the here's

45:21.560 --> 45:27.480
the reason why so so Tommy is saying well listen this quote we are paying people very talented

45:27.480 --> 45:32.920
people we have big publishers huge publishers midsize publishers we have big developers we got

45:32.920 --> 45:37.760
small developers medium developers and if there's a concept that they bring us then we're gonna take

45:37.760 --> 45:42.240
all of the risk away from them financial risk as well and we'll front load all of the royalties I

45:42.240 --> 45:48.280
love that but there's a part of me that reads that quote while I'm doing this thing with my hand that

45:48.280 --> 45:54.200
a certain cheeto with a lot of power does when he talks I can't help it and also I'm sorry Tommy

45:54.200 --> 45:58.760
I'm so sorry also that we I was gonna give you money for your game too if you put it on their

45:58.760 --> 46:04.640
system and front thing is I don't think he feels it's hype given the big lead-up he had and how

46:04.640 --> 46:10.280
excited he's been on Facebook yeah I really I really feel really happy for him and hope he's

46:10.280 --> 46:15.120
successful I do too yeah don't get me wrong like even though I'm being a little playful with some

46:15.120 --> 46:19.800
of these comparisons like I really do want this new Intellivision to do well but there's also that

46:19.800 --> 46:24.920
part of me like I'm gonna be honest I'm also skeptical because I'm like okay but like it's

46:24.920 --> 46:31.040
it's an Intellivision remake you've already set the bar at you're not going after PlayStation and

46:31.040 --> 46:40.040
Xbox so that right there should set the bar kinda lower so why come move the bar high does that make

46:40.040 --> 46:48.080
sense I don't know that's that's that's where my concerns are anyway to register participation for

46:48.080 --> 46:55.080
this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vognetwork.com use the passphrase badge we would

46:55.080 --> 47:00.000
rather have 20 epic games as opposed to 50 mediocre games a game on the Intellivision

47:00.000 --> 47:04.600
console has to be at least a 7 out of 10 well if it's not a 7 out of 10 they're not gonna put it

47:04.600 --> 47:08.680
on the car I don't think that's what I think that again I think that's just kind of hype which you

47:08.680 --> 47:16.860
know okay cool they want to price this console under $200 even less than $179 they will not be

47:16.860 --> 47:22.960
using crowdfunding to do it wireless Bluetooth controllers SD card slot HDMI output USB slot for

47:22.960 --> 47:31.080
add-ins hackers delight is what this shit sounds like which no problem with that anyway he talked

47:31.080 --> 47:35.920
about imagine being able to play pitfall 40 years later with completely amazing photorealistic

47:35.920 --> 47:40.440
graphics incredible movie sounds we're not gonna mess with the thing that made the game super

47:40.440 --> 47:45.640
popular that's my imagine be able to play Street Fighter but instead of the Street Fighter sprites

47:45.640 --> 47:51.520
that you know and love we took the Street Fighter actors from the Street Fighter movie and put him

47:51.520 --> 47:57.240
into the game it's so much better than the original Street Fighter fuck all the way off

47:57.240 --> 48:04.320
fuck all the way off with that quote because I was actually really excited about because I'm like

48:04.320 --> 48:10.640
yeah actually that sounds I pitfall is a classic game that's a great idea why not just make take

48:10.640 --> 48:16.620
like a classic formula but like you know it's shush it up a little bit and and now you got

48:16.620 --> 48:20.480
something a little bit newer I I don't know that might that was my favorite part of the whole thing

48:20.480 --> 48:27.480
I'd be into that anyway Bobby and chat says Tommy is the one fronting the money he's not asking you

48:27.480 --> 48:35.080
or me to crowdfund it so yeah the fact that you know he's putting any where's no jokes aside you

48:35.080 --> 48:39.480
know if anything if anybody can pull it off I believe Tommy could do it so I'm I'm not worried

48:39.480 --> 48:44.200
but I'm just saying yeah it's fun good luck and don't fuck it up that's what we're telling to Tommy

48:44.200 --> 48:48.840
I will mention this real quick though about the controller they're they're bringing back the disc

48:48.840 --> 48:54.080
now here's the thing the Intellivision disc was really cool and that it's very easy it's flat and

48:54.080 --> 48:59.160
it's simple the Intellivision the old one sucked because it wasn't the disc itself but the ridge

48:59.160 --> 49:03.920
the hard raised ridged around it so when you played in television games for a long time it

49:03.920 --> 49:08.680
was your thumb and your nail that went into that hard ridge and so after you've played after a

49:08.680 --> 49:14.160
while it started to hurt so we're gonna get rid of that Ridge right so you can hand your mom or

49:14.160 --> 49:17.800
your grandparent a control with the disc on it and it's like a mouse you moved around when you

49:17.800 --> 49:22.680
see something on screen move around same thing with the disc so you know anyway he's gonna put

49:22.680 --> 49:29.760
out more details after October 1st he says don't expect a release date he says the company has one

49:29.760 --> 49:38.240
in mind not this Christmas and not next Christmas so that says 2020 at the earliest for this thing

49:38.240 --> 49:44.760
so the good news in that although you might be thinking like god that's a long way out to hype

49:44.760 --> 49:51.680
something up the good news is if you're gonna release a console in 2020 you want to have those

49:51.680 --> 49:59.040
great developers on board now to start making those games so I would actually be a little more

49:59.040 --> 50:03.040
concerned if he said it's going to be out this Christmas I'd be like how are you gonna get

50:03.040 --> 50:10.280
quality games by this Christmas but 2020 is most likely when we're gonna see another set of

50:10.280 --> 50:20.960
consoles come out true but PlayStation 5 and Xbox 2 are probably gonna charge at least 400 if not

50:20.960 --> 50:26.640
$500 for their new consoles you know again we got a long way to go guys I'm not gonna speculate too

50:26.640 --> 50:33.260
bad on this so if Intellivision is your remasters of your classic games reimagines of your classic

50:33.260 --> 50:39.260
games for a hundred and fifty bucks it will look pretty appealing next to those other two to a

50:39.260 --> 50:44.080
certain crowd not maybe not for you me her or the people that are like super to give I don't know

50:44.080 --> 50:50.000
with the right games I might I would be into it actually so we'll see we'll see anyway some quick

50:50.040 --> 50:55.440
comments from chat and then we'll move on let's see Bobby Blackwell says I mean everyone made fun

50:55.440 --> 50:59.920
of him for the early days of video games live and he's like trust me it'll work and people were like

50:59.920 --> 51:05.160
you start with fucking pong and are you nuts and now video games live is a worldwide phenomenon no

51:05.160 --> 51:10.880
as much as we rib a little bit on Tommy and this there's some of these quotes and things you know

51:10.880 --> 51:18.280
what like like Loki reference this is sure to go better than the Coleco vision Coleco chameleon or

51:18.280 --> 51:21.760
karma Camille what the hell was that thing called Coleco chameleon the Coleco chameleon this is

51:21.760 --> 51:28.440
sure to go better than the Atari thing is what could possibly go wrong anyway moving on Dark

51:28.440 --> 51:34.240
Sakura speaking of classics well the Daria series is coming to the switch it looks like it's a big

51:34.240 --> 51:38.920
collection which I'm pretty happy about although there are some that are only in the special

51:38.920 --> 51:43.040
edition so of course the special edition would be what I would want in the normal one we get the

51:43.040 --> 51:48.800
arcade versions of Darius Darius to sagaya he said Darius I thought he said Daria for saying

51:48.800 --> 51:57.600
there's a sweet coming back you pew pew pew you also get Darius guide and in the special version

51:57.600 --> 52:04.080
you get the super Famicom versions of Darius twin Darius force for a master system sagaya you also

52:04.080 --> 52:10.960
get Darius 2 for Sega Genesis and Darius alpha for PC engine and it looks like it's gonna be

52:10.960 --> 52:16.000
pretty sweet the Darius games are great not too easy but that special edition also comes with a

52:16.000 --> 52:25.520
CD with arranged tracks and a Darius art book and an acrylic stand so there you go Darius sweet is

52:25.520 --> 52:33.960
this a shooty shoot pew pew game that you enjoy from the past yes it is all right well speaking

52:33.960 --> 52:40.920
of a game from the past Battletoads so Battletoads is a pretty popular game we probably just

52:40.920 --> 52:44.800
saw some speed runs of it actually on during summer games done quick which I did watch a ton

52:44.800 --> 52:50.840
of and I've been slowly parsing through that six hour or seven hour run of Final Fantasy 6 I love

52:50.840 --> 52:54.480
that shit made me actually want to go back and play Final Fantasy 6 which I might now they have

52:54.480 --> 53:03.960
the SNES classic mini but did you know that don't you mean Final Fantasy 3 then her yes I also have

53:03.960 --> 53:09.880
the English translated version of 5 now on there too they put that on there so let's see time to

53:09.880 --> 53:15.520
hack Loki's systems that was less than a day it was a day because I didn't touch it the first day

53:15.520 --> 53:20.680
so you don't have a normal Super Nintendo do you not anymore it's gonna see you could just do the

53:20.680 --> 53:27.560
same thing with it ever drive but then I do the CRT TV and yeah I have I don't have a original I

53:27.560 --> 53:31.600
might have actually I think I do have an original yellowing Super Nintendo somewhere I need it

53:31.600 --> 53:38.080
because I got you um what came to they get you Megaman X yes you did Megaman X but I now I have

53:38.080 --> 53:46.080
the retron 5 that's what I can play all that stuff on now so anyway sorry look no problem so did

53:46.080 --> 53:52.440
you know that there was a version of Battletoads the arcade game that was supposed to be coming to

53:52.440 --> 53:59.960
the Game Boy but never was finished so apparently now it is so they had one of our and they said one

53:59.960 --> 54:05.680
of our engineers here happened to have a Game Boy emulator we dragged the file into it and waited

54:05.680 --> 54:11.000
with bated breath he said and it ran I couldn't believe it no one had seen the game in about 22

54:11.000 --> 54:16.520
years I was the only person who recalls it's existence at all using the original source code

54:16.520 --> 54:22.640
they worked out a cheat for infinite lives and they ran through the entire game and they found

54:22.640 --> 54:29.240
out that the game was complete they just never released it so I don't know are they going to

54:29.240 --> 54:33.520
release it maybe it'll be part of a collection or some maybe that ROM will just find its way

54:33.560 --> 54:38.040
onto the internet maybe Microsoft will magically put it out to build hype for their new Battletoads

54:38.040 --> 54:45.280
game that's probably also in 2020 with the new television so who knows yeah so Battletoads arcade

54:45.280 --> 54:53.880
they also had an SNES port planned but that never happened either all right well this might make

54:53.880 --> 54:58.320
some of you sad I don't know I don't know how many of you shop with Amazon Prime but Amazon Prime is

54:58.320 --> 55:04.800
starting to scale back some of the 20% discounts Amazon is scaling back rereleases and remasters

55:04.800 --> 55:09.680
they've added those to the games that are ineligible for 20% off when you pre-order

55:09.680 --> 55:16.960
although apparently some of the games that are on the list right now still will have this 20%

55:16.960 --> 55:23.320
applied for example Shenmue one and two still offering the savings on this does this mean

55:23.320 --> 55:29.960
Spyro the dragon is not going to let us get 20% off I think I'd be curious for more details what

55:29.960 --> 55:35.800
this kind of means like would this just be like The Last of Us remastered when they like put a

55:35.800 --> 55:41.960
ps3 game on the ps4 is that but like you know cuz there's there's different levels of remaster

55:41.960 --> 55:45.840
you know what I mean yeah sometimes they really go in and clean it up are they talking about like

55:45.840 --> 55:49.880
here's the game of the year edition with all the other stuff with it or because if Captain Toad

55:50.280 --> 55:55.960
counts which is gonna be pretty much a port of the Wii U version except what they changed some of

55:55.960 --> 56:01.200
the Mario stuff to Mario Odyssey and that stuff like just add stuff to it so changing things it's

56:01.200 --> 56:07.680
it's it's a very it's very gray in this but I think this is all leading up to Amazon eventually

56:07.680 --> 56:13.760
getting rid of this discount altogether because Best Buy has recently done it the game publishers

56:13.800 --> 56:21.080
and the game studios hate this they do not like this 20% discount thing they feel it devalues

56:21.080 --> 56:28.640
their games and it's it cuts into the whole digital thing where with more and more people

56:28.640 --> 56:35.200
going digital with their games that is a bigger cut that Nintendo especially Nintendo Sony and

56:35.200 --> 56:39.440
Microsoft get when you buy directly the all that overhead that would usually go to GameStop between

56:39.440 --> 56:44.120
like the 47 that it cost to sell to a retailer like that $13 difference that's how GameStop

56:44.120 --> 56:48.000
makes their money guess what they can't say shit about it because the only thing that really would

56:48.000 --> 56:53.400
the MSRP ever has an effect on is advertising dollars because they you have to abide by their

56:53.400 --> 56:58.600
rules if you want to get that advertising money that they might provide but they're not taking it

56:58.600 --> 57:04.520
which in this case they're probably not taking the money then they can eat a dick it doesn't matter

57:04.520 --> 57:09.040
because they can charge whatever they want for that fucking game boo fucking who that you don't

57:09.040 --> 57:16.480
like it all right well let's travel back to it let's travel back to a simpler time let's go back

57:16.480 --> 57:22.280
to a time when there were no remasters and remakes because we were getting games for the very first

57:22.280 --> 57:29.000
time save for maybe the Ninja Gaiden trilogy I did Ninja Gaiden trilogy I some childhood habits

57:29.000 --> 57:38.120
are hard to break anyway what I'm trying to think of other old like Super Nintendo cartridges of

57:38.120 --> 57:47.440
NES games Oh Super Mario all-stars anyway let's get to the classic game of the week actually once

57:47.440 --> 57:52.600
a month our soccer says you know what fuck the game we're gonna do when you have another month

57:52.600 --> 57:57.960
to make up for we're gonna do a peripheral so last week we got June's a little late this tonight

57:57.960 --> 58:06.480
we're getting July's yes classic peripheral of the month and I think I think dance pads dance pads

58:06.480 --> 58:14.120
and it's really a big broad selection of them so I'm really casting a net and in this case actually

58:14.120 --> 58:25.760
the 1987 power pad can even be included in the genre of soft pads the early ones were typically

58:25.760 --> 58:32.520
10 to 20 bucks they got more expensive as time went on but they have different sensors under the

58:32.520 --> 58:41.440
pad where you can step in different places konami released their own other makers of the soft ones

58:41.440 --> 58:50.080
were BNS USA I read octane in tech mad cats to my my box naki international and Nintendo's action

58:50.080 --> 58:56.400
pad and let's not forget the konami insanely expensive solo pad that they released that was

58:56.400 --> 59:03.840
an arcade thing yeah like a thousand bucks well and basically just sticking with the soft pads

59:03.840 --> 59:12.200
for now as things went on you know there are even they came out on all kinds of systems I had the

59:12.200 --> 59:17.600
dreamcast ones were the first ones I had also as I call it the slip and death pad because it had a

59:17.600 --> 59:24.640
plastic cover over the top that would come loose was weird to me and it was falling over dead then

59:24.680 --> 59:32.480
hard pads came out and hard pads you know they were usually made of metal some would be plastic

59:32.480 --> 59:41.120
there were I think the very first ones that came out with those arcade style ones and we're looking

59:41.120 --> 59:46.200
at you know upwards of six hundred dollars a thousand more if you're getting you know doubles

59:46.200 --> 59:52.040
pads as well but other manufacturers for those with EDR game there's cobalt flux my my box brown

59:52.040 --> 59:58.040
box and red octane and not the international as well but these were meant to be the arcade

59:58.040 --> 01:00:05.080
experience although they work anywhere from really well made to really flimsy and then you also had

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:11.600
the solid-state pads which those instead of using mechanical switches they used a proximity sensor

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:17.560
so that they would detect where your your feet were when they were hitting it so it didn't actually

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:23.040
have to use moving parts you know kind of like the way a solid-state hard drive would work it's

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:31.920
all fair now there were of course other things that this led to because I'm gonna include some

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:37.680
of this now step mania when it came out now the predominant games that use these pads were of

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:45.280
course EDR you also did have like what you were talking about the jungle book rhythm and whatever

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:53.800
shake your butt yeah whatever that was called yeah but you know there were knockoff games but

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:59.680
really DVR was the big thing for in step mania when it seems the advent of step mania they would

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:07.720
start to do like USB converters for those dance pads or just flat-out USB ones I know that pump

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:14.600
it up had PC pads specifically for their version so got all kinds of different ones so and some of

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:19.200
the major ones you had your DDR slush in the groove slash step mania with the arrow panels

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:26.880
you had pump it up when solo came out there was of course the solo pad although you could remap

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:35.720
your own X buttons there was dance UK and MC grooves dance craze that had eight and then

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:49.040
techno motion with nine what about Britney's dance beat by the way I was very even though

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:53.680
what YouTube has moved on to pink dinosaur I was very touched by your Asia O'Hara tribute there

01:01:53.680 --> 01:02:03.280
during the opening I guess her you know neither was her lip-sync they weren't dead people are

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:07.040
saying to drop dead butterflies they weren't dead they just couldn't breathe they were frozen

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:14.040
it was too cold in there anyway I know someone who did butterflies at their wedding it was very

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:23.080
sad anyway homebrew pad so that also led to the very crafty out here I'm looking at Loki to try

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:30.600
making their own dance pads people using plywood what kind of fool well and even modifying dance

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:37.060
pads like the ones that she who shall not be named had where they were plywood and you know

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:41.280
clear packing tape which by the way is the way I passed my first line Twitter wasn't one of those

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:47.760
just saying but now people will build them out of wood sheet metal acrylic glass polycarbonate

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:54.600
you know just DIY dance pads by rewiring a controller or building their own controllers

01:02:54.600 --> 01:03:01.160
this way and some of them you know are pretty crafty they'll have like the solo arrows or have

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:08.440
arrows across the whole pad so they can switch between DVR and pump it up and a lot of them are

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:12.680
meant to use like some of them won't have like circuit switchers so that they can use them on

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:20.840
multiple different machines and they end up in some cases the really well-made ones will be cost

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:26.680
wise about the same as one of the professional ones you buy at the store so as far as other

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:35.600
games that use dance pads and I'm going to be going into some weird ones of course there are

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:42.920
the ones that use the NES power pad breakthrough great gaming presents axle all of the mini games

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:49.600
for DVR Mario mix and craft rocking the boat perhaps soccer striker and crash virtual dojo

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:58.440
and then a game called exsult DVR a mole which is like black and white many games in dance praise

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:07.000
to the remit and dance dress which is a Tetris simulator and the 2014 game crypto the network

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:17.520
answer and there you go all right you didn't mention the one that I have seen before I think

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:27.160
it was called dance Christ or something like that oh dance praise yeah I'm sorry yeah I think

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:34.200
everyone how dare you question yes Christ dance Christ instead of just Christ I'm just gonna go

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:40.680
dance Christ dance Christ it's our I could just do bend Ella Christ all right let's see going to

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:45.680
chat over at live at dot vogue dot word calm by buckle says I remember always wanting street cop

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:50.120
for the NES power pad I read about it in Nintendo power and really really really wanted it I never

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:56.440
got it as Joe 100 Matt brings up spider stomp you know what power pad game was the bomb my favorite

01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:04.040
was the the awesome like the second most awesome combo cart on the NES next to Super Mario and duck

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:11.240
hunt was short order and a explode what was those were those that those games from a jam on power

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:18.680
bad you did you ever go to that bowling alley and like conquered that I can't remember what the

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:25.760
dancing game was but it had too small too big and then too small again six buttons huh and it was

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:31.920
the music was not good you don't say I think it was and I don't leave I don't think it was Korean

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:38.480
I don't I think it was actually a Taiwanese dancing game okay um but I don't remember what it was

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:45.080
called I don't either it's like dance motion or dance 3d dx one time see now I'm gonna this is

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:50.200
gonna bother me and I've only got three minutes to look this up so now I want to play though the

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:55.320
future of these dancing games and that's that little rainbow LED dancing on the what was rush

it was like called like it dance motion or something it's techno motion no because that

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:25.760
was the nine panel one I don't think it was yeah it's it's okay it's okay if you can't think of it

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:52.200
coming back from the kitchen I don't know what I was doing I was very frustrated that we didn't

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:57.960
have a lot of coffee left and as I was coming back I slammed my knee into this coffee table

01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:01.480
here which is where like Jamie would usually put her computer it's it's hard to explain what you

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:05.840
guys don't have the visual because I slammed my knee into the table and like it was loud like you

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:10.320
could hear that when I slammed into that table right Loki and yeah I'm like oh god is it bleep

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:13.680
because it really hurts and I'm like okay it's not bleeding so we're good but I looked at it

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:19.040
like oh that's definitely gonna be a bruise tomorrow so that'll be fun that'll affect my

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:24.680
ability to I get my steps in for the day so I yeah that was a injury workman's comp workman

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:29.960
oh wait this job doesn't pay anything all right well let's get back to the gaming news and then

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:34.480
we'll get to your calls but first some rapid-fire news starting with Loki so there was a tease a

01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:41.840
brand new surgeon simulator trailer called bone-shattering news and what it revealed

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:48.840
was a hit you know the hand that you normally have in a surgeon simulator fumbling amount stuff

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:54.080
and then trying to push a light switch which leads people to believe that there's a hint

01:08:54.080 --> 01:09:00.240
that there's gonna be a switch port of the game coming soon so that we will have to wait and see

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:09.160
but apparently that could be a thing but speaking of ports of games RPG maker MV is coming to

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:17.120
PlayStation 4 Xbox one and the switch now becoming I believe next year and the trailer I know I watch

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:22.560
shows absolutely nothing but I love RPG maker and I'm looking forward to checking that out

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:32.480
one it's out here at some point so sweet and then are you gonna make naughty RPGs RPG no honestly I

01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:37.640
haven't actually messed with RPG maker that much because it is a lot of work to make an RPG yeah

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:42.760
so I would have to have something in mind like a full story that I'd want to do and make a naughty

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:50.240
RPG what am I in high school well and in back then it was not a text venture games and yes I

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:56.040
have made one there is one that exists out of basic whatever happened to the guy that made the

01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:00.600
olr text adventure game do you remember the olr text adventure game somebody made one back in

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:06.040
the day this was this was like the early this is the live 365 days of olr somebody made an olr text

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:10.160
adventure as somebody who doesn't listen anymore sadly because they were clearly a super fan to

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:16.320
have gone to that extent to make a text adventure game I I have to like to tart to tart dark Tetsuya

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:21.840
do you remember this because this goes way back I'm surprised not on the wiki somewhere there

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:27.240
might be a story on the or I don't know there's it there is an olr text adventure game out there

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:35.440
somewhere it's old anyway yeah but it was it was cool that it existed you want to do a few more

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:43.720
should I just take over um I can do okay so and then the new neo geo game coming to the switch is

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:50.120
a game called super spy and it's gonna be coming out next week and it was originally released in

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:55.720
1991 apparently it's a little bit different than some of the other neo geo games we've gotten

01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:02.080
because it's a beat-em-up in the first person perspective with an RPG elements I've never

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:08.960
played this game that's fun so neat and then another tease of stuff to come they introduced

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:16.440
a brand new boss for Mega Man 11 called blast man and I gotta say I really do like the new artwork

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:22.040
of this game so I really can't wait to play it when it comes out but October 2nd is when I'm

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:28.200
gonna have to wait for this to be released and I got a few things for you including the fact that

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:33.640
talim was announced for Soul Calibur 6 if you remember her from I used to play her all the

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:37.680
time in Soul Calibur 2 she had like the little little things on her hands and she was very fast

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:42.680
moving I think she's like an air princess or something like that so anyway she's gonna be in

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:48.440
Soul Calibur 6 which is the game that is coming out this year and oddly we didn't hear like

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:52.360
anything about it e3 so they've been kind of reminding us of its existence with these character

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:56.200
reveals and so forth so that's yeah that's the thing oh yeah that's the thing actually I love

01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:00.680
Soul Calibur so I'm super excited for Soul Calibur 6 I just I hope it's good that's all

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:06.800
anyway also let's talk a little about starfield because starfield they are saying could be a

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:13.120
cross-gen game that's all that should give you an indicator when that's coming out right and that

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:19.280
should also give you an indicator on Elder Scrolls 6 because this one is first remember so anyway

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:25.240
apparently the next gen could mean two things for Bethesda it does mean hardware and it does mean

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:30.920
software on our side and it also means gameplay so that could be a little play out of words that

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:36.520
it's the next generation of RPG we've developed brand new bugs and glitches in ways that you'll

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:43.120
never imagine that's right get lost in the galaxy forever in all new ways anyway starfield has been

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:50.880
in development since 2015 I guess seeds of the game the first ideas were back in 2004 so this

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:56.280
game goes way back but games they took a long time to develop don't you know I used to be a

01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:03.280
Star Explorer until I took a comet to the knee all right let's travel around the world to check out

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:08.320
some upcoming releases things that will be coming out a little bit sooner than starfield or Elder

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:12.960
Scrolls else set those expectations pretty low because we are in the middle of July one of the

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:19.320
slowest months of the year so we've got Hotel Transylvania three monsters over board on PC

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:24.760
switch tie-in PlayStation 4 and Xbox one and that's not your sort of cup of tea but then maybe

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:30.840
shining resonance reframe on PC switch PlayStation 4 and Xbox one that's a role-playing game and

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:39.480
that's gonna be coming out this week as well and then let's see here actually I think there's one

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:47.040
more Warhammer vermitide 2 on Xbox one and then the end of the week some actual notable stuff

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:54.120
captain toad treasure tracker on the Nintendo switch in 3ds and octopath traveler on the switch

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:58.160
and I am planning to pick that up yeah I was gonna say I thought before you were shading this weekend

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:02.280
releases I was like wait a minute wasn't this week well it's still slow I mean yeah it is what

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:07.680
one big game in the week is not a huge huge deal but I know a lot of olr people are gonna be

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:12.180
checking out the octopath traveler game I'll probably end up picking that up myself honestly

01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:17.380
and then hey captain toad I know has its fans too and people that will want to revisit that game all

01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:24.140
over again on the switch especially if you never got the chance on the Wii U all right let's move

01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:29.780
on I'm gonna get into some releases for Japan and talk about what you can look forward to there

01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:37.020
including let's see this week on the 12th can go kuto Mary Skelter 2 in a regular and limited

01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:41.980
edition that's the only release on the PlayStation 4 this week so I'm trying to figure out if this is

01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:47.580
like a big title or not but it's a compile-heart game and it's based off it looks like another

01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:53.060
anime game but they're talking about there's dungeon map size adjustments oh it's a upgrade

01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:56.900
of an original game because they talk about this is different from the original game there's an

01:14:56.900 --> 01:15:01.420
automatic feature in jail roulette and various features added to the warehouse so this is a

01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:10.280
remaster was that I can go kuto Mary Skelter to regular and limited edition yeah that really I

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:16.040
mean and then we go to the switch this week in Japan octopath traveler also has a Japanese

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:22.000
release and there are some new amiibo splatoon characters I believe this is what we have this

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.920
island marine yep yeah I think it's them but the versions he may and eta are their names over in

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:34.760
Japan so they're out in Japan this week as well as a game called the Susum a Kino Pio tai-chu comes

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.880
out on the switch this week so it's a much bigger week on the switch than it is anywhere else so oh

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:46.360
do you know Susum a Kino Pio tai-chu that's captain toad that's what they call it over there

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:54.640
much different name hmm all right anyway Loki what about the UK UK has shiny residents reframe

01:15:54.640 --> 01:16:01.120
that's coming out on Xbox one the switch and PlayStation 4 they are also getting the Pearl

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:09.320
and Marina amiibo Lego the Incredibles is coming out on PlayStation 4 Xbox one and the switch also

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:15.000
Hotel Transylvania 3 monsters overboard on those same three systems captain toad treasure tracker

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:21.640
and octopath traveler both on the switch and then they're also getting in addition to that earth fall

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:27.840
deluxe edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox one so it's it's basically it's octopath traveler featuring

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:34.400
captain toad week I've heard so many comparisons to that to Final Fantasy 6 I'm like I'm hearing

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:39.520
I'm hearing it's more like a saga game which actually has me where I I think the saga series

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:46.800
is super overrated unpopular opinion sorry about yeah so when I hear it compared to saga I'm like

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:59.080
I hope not anyway let's move on and get to the mailbag because every week you guys send us

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:05.440
emails to participate at orange lounge radio.com you send us your emails to participate at orange

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:11.200
lounge radio.com every week but some weeks you don't this weekend and send us email any emails

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:18.160
though so much for the mailbag segment too busy with fireworks apparently y'all too busy as my

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:23.200
mom used to say why don't you just set your money on fire it's the same bang for the buck that's

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:27.400
what people are like money on fire bet you lit off all sorts of fireworks with your kids I'm

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:33.920
like I don't feel like wasting money on garbage yeah yeah so well you're just gonna blow your

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:37.480
hand off actually you know how I would always get my mom to come around in the end though is

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:44.640
I would be like oh but this fireworks booth the money is going towards preschools or it's going

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:50.760
towards schools and then my mom would be like all right what are we gonna get so there was always a

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:55.640
way to bring her around oh yeah yeah we got the co-workers why she goes ones you know this one's

01:17:55.640 --> 01:18:02.200
for our church and stuff I'm like I'm not buying I always ask what the charity is because obviously

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:08.720
there are certain religions I want to make sure I'm not indirectly donating to something that would

01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:14.400
fund you know anti-gay teaching or anything that supports conversion therapy so I do try to you

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:20.080
know investigate a little bit but usually I almost always will find the marching band that's raising

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:23.880
money and that's you know that was me in high school I was them I was the band geek so I almost

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:28.080
always end up buying either from marching man or if the Masonic people the Dimalay because I was

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:31.560
involved in that when I was a kid it's a Dimalay people find me I always buy from that too so I

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:37.800
just I've stopped after each year it's been why I buy any this year I know it's past like every

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:43.320
year it's been just like more depressing than the last with how the fireworks are you'd buy it like

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:48.200
something it's like a this you know grand finale firework in the last like a minute and it's just

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:53.160
for forget it why bother I should ask that I we keep talking about charities and fireworks I

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:58.360
don't know if it is that way everywhere but here in our region which I assume is the way most

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:03.440
California works which I assume is the way most of the nation works but I'm not sure probably you

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:09.080
can only buy approved fireworks the safe and sane fireworks and they're all like charity boosts it

01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:13.000
doesn't matter anywhere there's like fires every day there's a fire when I came in today oh well

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.040
you because then they everybody drives down to TJ and brings in the fireworks across state line or

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:22.760
even like Nevada you go to vata buy different stuff that he can here and they bring them here

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:26.920
but TJ is the biggest you know people are driving into Mexico and buying crazy shit and they bring

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:33.240
them here so that's just the way it happens so but the ones you're supposed to use are all

01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:38.440
funding charity but somebody's got to be the big I like that I'm gonna fire off I liked all the uh

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:44.200
you know was it the announcements you know LA County does not allow fireworks whatsoever

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:48.520
then you see you know the animation of like a plane flying and there's just fireworks going

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:55.560
off everywhere it's like right yeah they really cracked down on that yeah it's just like here

01:19:55.560 --> 01:20:00.440
don't buy illegal fireworks it's like every even mortar is going off everywhere the day before the

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:06.600
day after like probably tonight you'll still hear some god it's so irritating anyway guy I really

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:10.360
have gone full-blown old man haven't I let's get back into some gaming that's what happens you

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:16.680
don't email us if you don't email us you're gonna get an old man rant how's that new rule for my 40s

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:20.840
all right lowkey let's get back into some gaming news all right so there's this brand new

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:26.600
uh fast start feature that was rolling out with the xbox one uh that's finally happened uh the

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:31.640
only problem is though is it only applies to certain games that are part of that game pass

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:38.920
um so let's see which games have it supported don't know but there's some only a few of them

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:44.040
that support it um and apparently it's the if you're not remember if you don't remember what

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:49.000
faster it was it applies machine learning technology to identify which parts of the

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:55.240
games are required uh for full-fledged gameplay and so it downloads those portions first so that

01:20:55.240 --> 01:21:00.600
the games load faster I mean and I guess that makes sense if you think about it it only works

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:06.680
for some of them because it says this is going to be getting better as it goes along then you know

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:11.400
there might not be support across the board yet I can't help but feel like this is a throwback

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:18.680
ready for another old man rant back in my day on the commodore 64 back in 1985 on the commodore 64

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:23.160
used to get the fast load cartridges that you plug into the back so I don't I don't know exactly how

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:26.760
they worked I think it would like preload some of the data onto the cartridge or something so it

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:30.360
allowed to fast load off the the cartridge or something I don't know exactly how that whole

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:34.360
thing worked because I'm not as computer savvy but they used to have those cartridges that were fast

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:39.400
load this is I feel like here we are in the year 2018 and we're still talking about fast load

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:44.040
applications and cartridges it's pretty um and then of course okay so I did find the list of

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:52.600
games that are supported by it um well at least that's what it said it's a big list Loki well it

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:58.520
said that there was going to be a list and then I went to the list and there's no list so that

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:02.760
it was nothing but ads for pornography I feel like I've been I wish at least that would have

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:09.240
been something done so this is just talking about what fast start is um geez well you know there's

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:15.400
not really a list here I was expecting a list you'd link to a list and there's no list so

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:22.360
whatever just guess you'll be surprised if it's Microsoft first party and it's on game pass it's

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:28.360
a likely candidate for this in the early stages probably yeah all right anyway uh let's talk about

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:33.880
uh a game that uh people loaded fast and then uninstalled pretty quickly unfortunately mass

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:38.920
effect Andromeda and here we are all this time after the original release the game we're still

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.880
talking about why did this game fail even though I done told y'all why the game failed a long time

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:47.720
ago it's because it should have been delayed that's why this game failed it should wait again

01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:53.560
am I guessing that we're gonna blame someone else for 500 alex yes you're a winner oh you get the

01:22:53.560 --> 01:23:00.600
daily double I love it when companies blame other peoples for their failings well here's the thing

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:05.800
and I here's the thing as much as we can taunt this guy for it I actually think he's getting

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:10.600
a lot of unnecessary shit for the quote and I will explain myself here in a minute so he's a

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:15.160
Bioware developer and he's Anthem's executive producer so I already don't like him just kidding

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:20.360
I will stick up for him here a little bit Mark Dara who was talking on Twitter uh a little bit

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:25.720
about this uh actually the clarifications came up on Twitter but he was talking about uh if Andromeda

01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:33.240
got a fair shake and he says no because the RPG genre was quite crowded at the time uh mentioning

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:39.480
that Andromeda launched at the same time as Zelda Breath of the Wild was called out now in a series

01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:45.960
of clarification tweets he goes on to kind of talk about that you know the game might have gotten a

01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:52.120
higher Metacritic score if it hadn't been released at the same time as like all these other RPGs to

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:58.200
which that were fully polished I know and I'm kind of like girl don't dig that it's like yes everybody

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:03.800
I know when I know when Andromeda came out I was like damn it these RPG elements are not good

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:10.120
enough why did they why did they skimp on the RPG elements here's the thing here's the message I

01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:18.440
took away from that honestly you knew you didn't have a 10 out of 10 game you knew you didn't have

01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:26.040
a 10 out of 10 game EA knew you didn't have a 10 out of 10 game everybody fucking knew you didn't

01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:31.320
have a 10 out of 10 game except the players but you released it anyway not only did you release

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:39.640
it you released it early for a very small group of people so that word could get out quickly that it

01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:46.040
wasn't a 10 out of 10 game because you were willing to shit I'm sorry EA was willing to

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:56.280
shit on the Mass Effect name that quickly you got sold the fuck out by the EA board

01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:06.280
you're not 10 out of 10 game to please investors which news flash if you delayed the game and just

01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:10.280
released it over the holidays the investors would have been pissed off in the short term

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:14.840
but guess what in the long term you might have had a better game with better sales and it would

01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:21.160
have turned out okay just like it did for Nintendo well maybe they had a timeline that

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:27.640
they had to hit they wanted to hit with anthem that forced them to finish the other game in

01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:31.320
order to be able to start development on that game you don't want to go there with me right now

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:38.520
oh come on we it's we should you don't want to go there with me right now let's open pandora's box

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:43.240
no we're gonna keep that closed because y'all you all already know you don't insert your raw

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:48.840
brand here you fucking know I've mentioned it enough on this program already so here's the thing

01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:57.800
do I now I said I would give this guy credit is there credit to the fact that this game came out

01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:05.400
when there were these other RPGs that came out and so therefore in a crowded marketplace it did end

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:09.320
up grasping for air a little bit more because gamers only have so much money and so forth

01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:14.120
yes it's the same thing in the movie industry right or same thing any other time of the year

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:19.640
right you release your movie the same weekend as a movie that does run away bang up success

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:23.960
your movie might suffer because of it that's what they're saying happened to the Han Solo story

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:30.200
I think that's just I think it's Star Wars fatigue a lot of people think that Star Wars fatigue

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:34.280
but that's what they're blaming it is that Han Solo came out when all this other stuff was out

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:37.880
in the summer whereas most of the Star Wars stuff as of recently has been in the winter

01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:42.920
anyway I don't want to change this into a different argument there is a little bit of

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:49.800
truth to that however this is why movies are unafraid to change their release dates

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:59.400
so again mark just remember your bosses sold your game out to keep the investors happy so just

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:04.200
you know you better hope anthem does well or else they're gonna sell out your company too

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:11.720
you know close down like all the other ones anyway but yeah I mean like come on like seriously

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:15.480
the complaint wasn't because of the RPG elements the complaint was this looks like an

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:19.880
unfinished rush job of a game is what the complaint was

01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:25.960
kaiju don't chat ask a great question honestly so what was wrong with the game and why did it feel

01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:35.320
rushed bugs like uh the faces spinning all around and all this stuff um I think also the story felt

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:39.720
kinda like and we know now with after all this like mass effect development stuff that they

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:46.360
have this one thing in mind the story felt a little bit like undone and I understand that

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:51.080
they want to keep the door open for dlc and all this but then they cancel the dlc they cancel the

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:58.120
dlc but the story just kind of feels a little half baked like it's like we got from point a to point

01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:04.520
b but we didn't really have that same meat and potatoes that flesh around it that we had in the

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:11.560
original mass effect trilogy you go play like mass effect 2 and 3 especially 2 it doesn't get better

01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:18.360
like I don't know how else to explain it then go play mass effect 2 and look at how look at what

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:24.520
a meaty fucking game that is and even though it has its own share of minor bugs at the end

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:28.200
of the day you don't care because it's kind of a meaty game and then put it side by side like

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:34.440
something like mass effect andromeda which feels kind of like there's a story there but it's a

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:42.040
little diet it's it's caffeine-free coke zero of mass effect that's what it is loki the worst

01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:49.320
possible thing I mean well it's still coke but it's barely it's caffeine-free and sugar-free

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:56.440
it's a husk of coke this once was coke there was a coke here now it's gone they've removed all the

01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:06.520
coke anyway um dungeon buster in chat says I played the games he mentioned none of them were

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:14.920
as unpolished as andromeda act deft says it's the cheapest knockout brand of coke it's diet shasta

01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:17.800
that's what it actually that's got to be a regional thing right because shasta is a

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:23.400
mountain ranger for those of you in norcal it's diet shasta that's what it is

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:31.560
or what's the what's the brand they sell at walmart is that the brand they sell at walmart

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:36.200
what's the pencil shasta they sell like they sell their own in-house brand that's fucking terrible

01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:43.320
i don't know the name of it but it's that it's archer farms that's targets brand right

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:50.040
anyway um all right i've had enough we're done talking about mass effect andromeda because i

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:54.760
swear to god these stories just get dropped them in my i i think dark tetsuya posts them

01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:59.240
just because he knows it's going to get me riled up let's move on you want to do this next story

01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:04.040
that we had for jamie but sure we can talk about this so there's the um apparently there's been

01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:11.960
a couple more uh tari prototypes that have been discovered sam's choice it is a choice

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:20.920
ladies and gentlemen if you buy that that's a choice choices um so there's been some prototypes

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:27.720
and unreleased video games from atari that they have discovered um i guess these last two were

01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:36.360
uncovered by a scott of the atari games museum um so the first one is a game called star trap

01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:45.480
which was designed around 1980 to 1982 and apparently uh this is the source code lacked

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:51.080
the character roms to complete the appearance but apparently you see like some collision boxes and

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:56.520
stuff so it's very basic and then there's another game it was called space storms they said was

01:30:56.520 --> 01:31:06.120
designed as a variation of avalanche which became kaboom so that one you have um i guess ask droids

01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:10.840
or comments that were falling down from the screen and a few energy shields placed in front

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:19.560
of you to absorb them and as you play the game the play area narrows i don't know these games look

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:24.040
basic i'm kind of surprised atari hasn't found a way to re-release these somehow one of their

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:28.280
multitude of collections well they have a new console coming out and they need crap for that

01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:34.120
so there you go who knows all right uh you got one more story loki and i've got one more and then

01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:39.000
we're gonna get to the skype line at orange lounge radio all one word on skype if you want to talk

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.600
about if you want to get me going on bioware again or if there's something else more pleasant you

01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:45.560
want to discuss maybe you want to talk about in television or something so this is funny because

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:50.200
like this there's like literally no meat to this story whatsoever but i'll mention it anyways

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:54.920
so i literally couldn't remember that this was even coming out until i saw this and that's why

01:31:54.920 --> 01:32:01.800
i put it on the show exactly it's like oh yeah yeah that was that thing yeah that is so apparently

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:06.040
you know in case you didn't remember because it wasn't mentioned at e3 at all dead island two's

01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:12.200
a thing and apparently according to the dead island twitter they announced that at the last

01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:16.440
e3 i went to because we went to like a that was like one of the last closed door things i ever

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:21.400
did it i remember the trailer but that was like a long ass time ago and it looked pretty good but

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:26.280
i mean that's a trailer that is based off of cg animation and not necessarily gameplay

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:35.240
um but it looked neat i guess um but yeah it's still in development and they'll share more later

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:42.280
so there you have it that's all the news okay everybody i got a quick uh i'm too lazy to bring

01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:47.720
up the official vog pole so i'm gonna just take a quick chat poll what will we get first the new

01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:55.560
in television or dead island two uh what's gonna be first dead island two part dead island two is

01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:59.320
gonna be first you say i think it'll be canceled you think it's gonna be straight up canceled you

01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:03.880
don't think deadline dead island two is dead on arrival that's what you're saying i think it'll

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:08.600
be a couple more years i don't know i i actually would disagree and i say dead island two will

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:17.320
finally make it here uh holiday 2019 and it will beat the in television probably all right but i'm

01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:22.120
out i'm out voted by our chat room we've got several votes for in television in our chat so

01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:28.360
far so all right anyway thank you for uh humoring me all right one more story for you guys that has

01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:32.520
to do with mega man why don't we end on a positive note here everybody loves mega man although

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:37.560
honestly i tried doing a stream this week at the mega man collection dear god i'm garbage at mega

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:43.080
man like how was it that i used to be so much better at mega man game genie fucking a no i

01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:49.480
never had a game genie i just i was more skilled when i was 12 anyway um gotta get good there is a

01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:57.320
mega man 30th anniversary playstation 4 bundle coming out in japan with 19 games that's right

01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:06.360
rockman 11 rockman classics collection one two rockman x anniversary collection one and two

01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:25.400
that is roughly 126 for all the mega man you could fit on a playstation that is mega collection

01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:30.280
and like every mega man collection known to man there it is uh although no word about a actual

01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:33.320
playstation 4 that looks like mega man like i'm kind of surprised they're not doing that

01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:37.480
opportunity because in japan or like they love you like an energy tank or something says that's

01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:44.680
more square oh yeah like a 300 energy tank collectible why not all right they had a case

01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:50.760
that was an energy tank one time i think orange lounge radio all one word on skype the skype line

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:56.600

01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:08.040
in chat says e-tank themed yeah sure all right anyway we have a call coming in let's get to it

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:14.360
hello you are on orange lounge radio who's this hey this act f hey buddy how you doing act f

01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:25.240
uh uh pretty much uh great uh though uh the the heat here is like crazy yeah you know i hear that

01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:30.040
most of the country is under a pretty bad heat wave which you know extends into parts of canada

01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:38.600
mexico our neighbors obviously um but um it it's hot here in sac but not as hot as it like usually

01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:43.640
is in july like we were outside doing pokemon go community day today and i think the high was

01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:50.920
expected to be like 96 97 yeah but this time of year we're usually looking at like 105 so i'll take

01:35:50.920 --> 01:36:03.560
it though yeah we we were at 105 uh here so thanks yeah this uh past weekend uh of pokemon go was

01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:12.840
like really crazy for me oh i'm very exhausted but uh it was worth it i i had really way too much fun

01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:20.520
and and i'm gonna talk about it because it's been two years since the game launched and and i

01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:26.280
actually want to hear your opinions on how the the the game has evolved that that much

01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:32.360
and in this past two years you know i think especially in the last year uh the game has

01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:37.000
evolved even so much more than it did in the first year and it almost kind of lends credit

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.240
to some of the excuses niantic was laying down when the game first launched about all the

01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:46.760
troubles they were having is that they really for whatever ridiculous reason weren't prepared for

01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:51.000
the number of people that were gonna jump onto this game although you know again i'm kind of

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:55.960
like dude it's it's pokemon it's a cell phone free game like of course a ton of people were

01:36:55.960 --> 01:37:00.680
gonna download it but i don't like i can say that and then even still like looking at capital when

01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:05.400
i was down at the capital today this is one of many places in sacramento people play down here

01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:11.480
at the capital uh sac state is a huge uh bed for people there's a big group like during that whole

01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:17.960
the the saturday thing i saw a big group of people going down in old fulsome yeah well yeah

01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:22.520
old fulsome had a lot but uh the fulsome paladio is a big event for the the big shopping center

01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:27.640
there the paladio is a bit like an outdoor mall they have a big uh presence on these community

01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:32.840
days and so forth so i mean like there's just tons of people that were out and so like you know again

01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:37.160
i laugh every time i hear pokemon go is a dead game to be fair i'm not really hearing that

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:42.200
anymore i was hearing that more like six months ago but now that the game has trading now that

01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:47.480
there are facts to back up the pokemon go is doing better financially than it was the questing and

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:52.840
definitely the gifts and stuff has gotten me to try to get yeah out there more because i feel

01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:57.560
obligated yeah yeah for sure i know some people are getting really frustrated at that though like

01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:01.960
the the the feel that you have to get out there and give out gifts but i'm just i'm just up front

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:06.920
with people i'm just like yo i try my best to get out gifts every day but like if you don't

01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:12.440
live near me then i'm probably not gonna you know try to increase my friendship as quickly with you

01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:18.440
because we're not gonna raid together now act deft in your case you you get a buy a lot of the time

01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:24.120
i do open a lot of your gifts but you know why i open a lot of your gifts right yeah because they're

01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:29.640
from mexico and so there's that distance that comes into play and the fact that the eggs you

01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:35.320
know it's kind of cool like honestly my favorite alolan pokemon is from one of my buddies on

01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:41.160
twitter who lives in hawaii outside honolulu and he sent me an egg from some type of pokey

01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:47.400
stop there and i got an alolan vulpix from hawaii and that's that's just neat i like that i think

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:54.200
that's so cool so um but anyway um i don't know if i even answered your question whatsoever act

01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:59.240
f but i mean how was your experience this past weekend and did you get a shiny articuno because

01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:05.480
if you did i'm hanging up on you no i i sadly didn't okay i didn't either i didn't get any

01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:10.840
articuno we're in the sad club oh i caught plenty of fucking articunos i did i was one of those

01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:16.040
people walking around the street but so one of my buddies swears by this up because they always

01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:21.240
raid on lunch there's a corporate park in rancho cordova with all these like corporations and so i

01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:26.520
i don't really ever go over there um but like we walked from business to business where there's all

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:30.120
these gyms and we did like eight and then i had to go because i had rehearsal but i did eight

01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:34.760
articuno raids and probably caught six of the eight articunos but no shinies huh yeah but like

01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:40.600
articuno wasn't really the raid boss i needed because like we had articuno a year ago when

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:44.840
raids first launched we had articuno out of the boxes so it's like i didn't fucking need

01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:50.680
articunos it was all about the shinies and even the way they there was i kid you not there was

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:55.800
70 people that showed up over at itt where the meeting spot was so they were like okay here's

01:39:55.800 --> 01:40:01.000
what we're gonna do we're not gonna care about color today because we know you're all here for

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.320
shinies right and everybody's like yeah shinies so it's like nobody was there to get the articuno

01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:09.240
everybody just wants nice they're like color doesn't matter because if you get a shiny then

01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:14.360
it's a guaranteed catch so you don't need 14 balls to catch a shiny articuno right so they're like

01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:19.720
color doesn't matter just split up with people that you want to raid with today have between

01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:25.160
six to ten people if you are having problems finding a group come over here to get matched

01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:29.800
like i gotta say the way they ran it was really efficient because they were just like your team

01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:34.040
doesn't fucking matter today none of it matters raid with your friends to increase your friendship

01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:38.520
bonuses and just do it that way and actually worked out really well oh raiding increases your

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:42.680
french bonus also because it's considered an activity that you did with somebody for the day

01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:47.560
but if you already traded gifts with that person today then the raid doesn't count oh that sucks

01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:50.840
but you still get your but you mean you get the bonus ball you get the bonus to attack you get

01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:56.840
the little things yeah so anyway i i keep talking at deft how you're you're the guest how was your

01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:04.600
experience with pokemon go this weekend uh again it was actually pretty fun to do uh again exhausting

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:14.040
because the weather here is like really extremely hot so uh we were uh i actually uh moved my local

01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:19.480
mystic group uh we pretty much planned out how we were going where we're going to go

01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:26.040
exactly what route we were taking and all that stuff because we don't have that many

01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:34.120
like pokestops or gems like near each other but uh yesterday was like really fantastic and and

01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:41.560
like you were saying uh even like we were all mystics uh we had some uh red people also like

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:47.480
yellow um mystic and valor with us and and they were playing too with us uh and exactly because

01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:55.240
we all well we all wanted a shiny even though not many people got it but i do uh with the group i

01:41:55.240 --> 01:42:02.600
was with uh and at least two or three people got a shiny so at least i i i'm like happy with that

01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:09.400
even though i didn't get a shiny myself yeah it was good to see people getting one for me yeah i

01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:14.120
saw people get the shiny articuno so i know they weren't lies contrary to what sj wanted

01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:19.080
a madison chat but what was a little bit frustrating was that one guy got three of them in

01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:24.360
a row and it's like you want to be happy but at the same time i fucking hate you man at the same

01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:29.480
time you're like why can't that be me dude now when you trade a shiny is it come over as a shiny

01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:33.960
yes so he could he he'll trade them up he's gonna trade them to be like i didn't really know this

01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:40.040
guy he's gonna trade him to his friends as he should um but uh i was very happy with the amount

01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:45.640
of xp because if you pop a lucky egg and you have the double xp bonus going on right now anyway it's

01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:51.080
40 000 xp array that i hit 38 today thanks in large part to all the rating yesterday it was

01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:56.680
like 400 000 xp yesterday and another 400 000 today it was it was nuts um but anywhere where

01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:01.800
i was going with that is that what i really liked that they did today with the community event is

01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:07.640
for the first time certain pokey stops when you spun them every like during the community day

01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:13.560
every pokey stops gives you a quest catch five whatever the the my squirrel so today it was

01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:20.440
squirtle but certain pokey stops today if you caught they were all the squirtle squad that's

01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:26.120
how you got the squirtles with the wrong wrongly shaping sunglasses in the game is that you would

01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:31.960
get those from the pokey stop however certain pokey stops would actually give you the shiny

01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:38.520
squirtle squad but here's the part that was pretty cool unlike the way they usually do

01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:44.760
shinies where if you tap on one and i tap on one you might get a shiny but i probably won't

01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:51.240
because the shiny is per person the way the pokey stops worked is if you could figure out

01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:58.440
which pokey stop gave you a quest for the shiny everybody who hit that node would get the shiny

01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:03.000
quest but you wouldn't know it was shiny because it was still called evolve five squirrels so you

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:09.000
had to share information and that made today way more awesome than any other community day

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:14.840
yeah because we were able to find out our little group found out that there was a there was a um

01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:20.040
a stop that's kind of on the edge of the capitol building it's not you you have to walk off the

01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:23.560
path to get to it it was called and i remember the name because you can't forget the same it

01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:28.520
was called senator capital kitty because it was it's a little gravestone for a cat who used to

01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:33.320
hang out around the capitol building okay that's that's the marker but that stop was a shiny

01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:38.280
squirrel so we would find the families and we would overhear the kids going i want the shiny

01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:42.600
squirtle squad so i actually there was there was i distinctly remember two instances i looked at

01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:47.000
the parents i said go over there to the corner there's a stop called senator capital kitty

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:51.560
spin that stop it has the quest for the shiny and they'd be like oh my god thank you so much

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:56.520
and like being able to like share that information so was it a different version of the squirtle with

01:44:56.520 --> 01:45:02.120
the glasses it was just shiny so it was the light blue with the glasses that's all all the glasses

01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:06.680
were all the glasses were it was the same fucking pikachu glasses but they put it on squirrel

01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:12.600
i even though yeah anime they were like a triangular i just think like the the the

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:17.000
shinies like they kind of like half acid it's like okay we're making this one slightly darker

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:22.600
it's like okay well to be fair they're copying what the original game boy games did so i'm not

01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:28.520
going to fault niantic for that they're only copying what was already given to them so they

01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:35.320
are not setting the rules of that anyway my point with that 10 minute long story was that how badass

01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:41.000
would that have been if there was pokey stops yesterday that would give you a quest that was

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:46.280
collect five articuno and you'll get a shiny that's how i wish they would have done it but

01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:51.800
i understand they want to make shinies special so i get that they don't want to hand them out like

01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:59.640
candy but they've got to find a balance here you know what i mean yeah yeah so i i feel like there

01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:05.960
was too many shiny ho-ohs like everybody fucking got one i accept me because i didn't rate enough

01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:10.440
but that's my own fault because i didn't rate enough so everybody got a fucking shiny ho-oh

01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:13.800
but nobody fucking got that articuno except that dude who got three of them in a row

01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:22.280
and i think that it isn't that bad but at least with this articuno uh they yesterday

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:29.000
it was like right really off because even like uh with the with the other legendaries that have

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:36.920
been shiny like lugia uh kai ogre i have gotten shinies of that of those only the only one it was

01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:44.120
ho but yeah again it was like oh i didn't do that many rates but yesterday i i kind of expected

01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:52.360
because i i at least i did 18 rates and i didn't get one i have a feeling this is not going to be

01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:57.640
i think this raid day was an experiment and we're going to see it again but i know i guarantee it i

01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:03.400
guarantee i will bet money we're going to see it again because this whole event was unlocked i

01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:08.040
use my quotey fingers because when niantic unlocks stuff in pokemon go it's like we were going to do

01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:11.400
it anyway we're just setting some arbitrary fucking goal we know you're going to hit

01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:18.120
so this all tied into the germany floral garden event right so they caught so many things and so

01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:23.640
or some i don't know but it tied into that event right so we all got our tokunos right well pokemon

01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:29.720
go fest is next weekend so what do you want to bet if we do all the awards that tie into pokemon go

01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:35.560
fest we're going to get moltres rating day and then they have the japanese event is last and

01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:41.000
that will be zapdos rating day okay so we're going to get two more rating days i guarantee it for

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:48.200
shiny moltres and shiny zapdos although did you know there's a bug where they used the shiny

01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:53.080
colors for regular zapdos so everybody who has zapdos has a shiny zapdos so i think they're going

01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:57.960
to end up flipping it so i think shiny zapdos is actually going to be regular anyway this i'm

01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:03.960
getting into super nerdy tech chat how many of you all miss pokestop podcast anyway so i do i

01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:09.560
know i know um but um i was gonna say so we'll have those events but i would bet in the future

01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:12.840
there's going to be like i think it would be awesome if they just did like a three-hour day

01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:20.760
where they're like every gym every fucking gym is going to light up with some legendary have fun

01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:26.360
yeah that would be awesome and then you have to pay on it but awesome like where's the fucking

01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:30.680
zapdos where's the lugia where's the kyogre and like people can kind of pick and choose what they

01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:34.360
want to do i think that would be awesome here's the drawback though and i don't want to spend

01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:37.800
forever talking about pokemon go but and since this was a shorter show tonight anyway we'll go

01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:45.320
we'll deep dive on a few subjects um the thing is though uh with that is that i kind of didn't like

01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:53.080
how it was three hours yesterday and three hours today so and maybe just because it's july and it's

01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:59.720
fucking hot but i think i would like to see it maybe like spread out a little more well either

01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:06.120
the whole day so i could pick and choose my hours a little better or at least do like raid day

01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:15.160
week off community day week off raid day like mix it up a little more i mean the tonight this

01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:19.720
weekend was fine because it was the first time but i hope it's not a fucking crazy ass weekend

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:27.320
like a lot this summer if that makes sense maybe they can do except like uh a community day a

01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:32.200
community week and they can be like the other events they have done like the adventure

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:38.200
one the fire one the water one suppose they they have expanded in that you can get chinese from

01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:45.880
those but at least uh not like to today that you can get chinese more frequently but at least

01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:51.720
at least expand it a little more because yeah it's it at least in in here with uh where i live

01:49:52.680 --> 01:50:00.200
again it's like really really hot it i i only lasted one hour uh outside because we we really

01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:05.000
didn't want to expose ourselves to the heat because it can get really really bad yeah your

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.360
health is most important no don't risk that for a video game but i was going to say that

01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:13.720
roselia thing they just did again as a spin-off of the event that happened in germany uh i was

01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:19.000
being told that those roselia shinies were like candy i didn't get one yeah i don't yeah i caught

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:26.680
a ton of them and not a single one was so i actually got two well lucky you but anyway yeah

01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:32.280
so i don't know i i i didn't see a roselia shiny so you know confirmation bias i guess but anyway

01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:40.600
anyway we spent 15 minutes talking about pokemon go but i loved it because it's been i a lot of

01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:44.840
people are getting back into it right now you know that it's the part the trading the friends

01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:52.840
list the gifts i i love seeing maybe this is part of the ingress nerd in me i love seeing the stops

01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:59.880
in other places and i go out of my way to send funny places to my friends list when i can like

01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:04.440
the other day i was walking around at um fairy tale town because you know over yes i remember

01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:09.080
the one yet right so so what i probably sent you the shoe or the cheese or like so like all

01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:13.240
send me something i remember fairy tale time like what you stand by fairy tale town yeah no i was

01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:21.880
because it's not without giving away my my entire life it's not far from blank uh and uh i tend to

01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:25.320
walk around there because there's a lot of pokey stops it's usually a farm of some sort there's a

01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:30.040
wingle nest or whatever but then now i'm like oh the pokey stops here are really funny too where

01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:35.880
i can send people like grandma's shoe the cheese jack and the beanstalk and like all the crazy

01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:43.240
shit that's around fairy tale town like i like that stuff so anyway but i also like seeing the

01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:47.720
stuff like you know all these things like that act def sends me from mexico i have friends in

01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:52.680
toronto and ottawa that send me stuff i like seeing this stuff in hawaii like i just it's

01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:57.080
cool like i don't know it's it's really cool like and it's something we don't really get to see in

01:51:57.080 --> 01:52:03.880
ingress like you might see keys get brought to you from some remote portal far away but

01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:10.600
you usually get keys to portals that are remote and far away you don't get the keys that people

01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:14.520
walk by in their everyday life you know what i mean yeah you can't really do anything with

01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:19.160
those either yeah well i mean unless you're part of like a giant operation that you're gonna throw

01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:24.280
to this lighthouse that's on the coast and that's how we're gonna field over the entire state you

01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:29.320
know things like that it's very different very very different anyway yeah actually also like

01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:36.120
receiving like gifts from uh from you like uh from you rob from you loki uh also from from mad

01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:43.240
yo dia and other people from bach uh also because i oh that's like it's like an interesting place to

01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:52.360
see and and i have and that's also why i also like send you gifts uh to any of you and try to

01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:58.040
like mix it up because i i do have my like route and all that stuff but if i can like go to other

01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:04.440
places and find other pokestops with gifts i i try to send those yeah for sure and i know when

01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:08.280
i travel i'm going to be trying to spend as many bogey stops as possible and try to send people

01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:13.080
like when i go to dragon con y'all are going to get the uh the what is that one that's right in

01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:18.760
the middle the view from the 34th floor of the high or the view of the 34th floor of the mariot

01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:23.240
or whatever that one's called where it's basically i don't know how this became well it was a portal

01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:28.280
and ingress obviously somebody took a picture from the top floor of the hotel down to the

01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:37.080
ground and that became a stop so i'm gonna say my goal is to send my entire friends list the view

01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:45.560
from the 34th floor and i will be looking forward to it no it sucks it doesn't save those that you

01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:50.200
get i would love if you have like a map because you get the maps to the badges and i love that

01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:53.960
a lot of people don't know this if you didn't know this about pokemon go check this out now

01:53:53.960 --> 01:54:00.040
okay open up your game and in the bottom left hand corner tap your trainer profile and make

01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:04.840
sure you go to the me page so you're not on the friends page go to the me page and down where your

01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:10.440
gym badges are hit the button that will show you all your gym badges so not just the six hit the

01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:15.080
one that shows you more and then when you're looking at all your gym badges in the lower left

01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:20.040
hand corner is a little picture of a map you tap the map and it actually shows you a map of the

01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:26.600
world it's a very crude pixelated map but you can actually see like where all your gym badges are

01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:32.840
from so i'm actually opening up my game right now if it'll um load i had it up a minute ago

01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:38.040
so i'm actually going in right now even though my game is running so slow because i've used my phone

01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:42.920
to death today uh and i'm going into my list and i'm looking at the map and so i can tell you

01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:52.280
i have 663 gym badges this doesn't really it's all green i can't see any 514 from this area 43

01:54:52.280 --> 01:55:03.000
in seattle uh 60 in chicago and eight at the atlanta airport because for some reason it's

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:08.440
separating there and how many do i have in downtown and surrounding area atlanta about 37

01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:12.040
so 37 in atlanta but nine by the year but i'm more by the airport

01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:16.520
so i love that because it's like a record of my travels it's really cool

01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:22.680
anyway all right act f my friend i'm gonna let you go so we can try to squeeze in more calls but i

01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:27.400
i i love talking about pokemon go so thanks for the call hey no problem and thanks for

01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:33.720
whole this and it's like a small pokestop podcast revival it was it was a little bit i almost wonder

01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:37.480
if i couldn't get shane to do another show because he actually plays the game now he just the little

01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:41.880
brat would sit there and talk about oh he got two shinies on articuno day and he got like four

01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:46.280
more today i don't know god he sold his soul to the devil for a shiny or something i don't know

01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:53.320
all right anyway take care my friend you too all right bye uh that was a long call but that's okay

01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:58.040
orange lounge radio all one word on skype if you want to get through i'm going to ask this already

01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:03.960
knowing the answer but i'm gonna try anyway do you have any last minute stories no i have to ask i

01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:07.720
have to ask all right let's take another call here real quick hi you're on orange launch radio who's

01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:15.080
this hey uh rob this is regi neater hey what's on your mind buddy uh no uh um well i wanted to

01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:22.440
bring up something uh a topic that you had mentioned uh uh during your call uh uh black

01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:29.240
both at the end of the show uh one thing if i remember right you had mentioned uh the whole

01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:37.080
twitch prime thing and uh the games they give you with that yes so twitch prime and especially

01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:41.640
this month they're really stepping it up to try to bring attention to it for a prime day yeah

01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:47.320
they're giving away free games but i think it's a very short window uh like a three-day window for

01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:51.240
the games uh or something that so i if you didn't already grab pillars of eternity i think the

01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:54.600
opportunity is closed because i think that was one of the first ones they did don't quote me on that

01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:58.840
but i feel like they're all like varying lengths it probably just depends on the game but anyway

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:05.560
everyday there's a few new ones up there now you have to have twitch's client to install these

01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:11.240
games so they're not steam codes they're not gogg codes they're twitch client codes so is twitch

01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:16.840
trying to push maybe a storefront well i mean twitch and amazon are married so it would make

01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:23.400
sense that's the direction they're going uh you may or may not recall twitch purchased a company

01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:30.280
called curse that was doing clients that really worked on managing your wow add-ons and some of

01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:34.120
your add-ons for things like minecraft and some of the other games that had a lot of add-ons

01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:39.560
so the evolution of this client because it still does all that is the twitch client so now the

01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:46.440
twitch client also i think you can buy games through it but the interface it's uh it leaves

01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:51.400
a little bit to be desired because it's very clear it wasn't starting as a store i think all it does

01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:56.680
is kicks you to the web so anyway so you do have to use twitch's client to install the games and

01:57:56.680 --> 01:58:02.040
then ultimately play them but free is free i guess right so anyway there's there's a little

01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:09.080
background yes twitch is doing their giveaways all right yeah now before i you know get into

01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:15.160
the actual question itself a little background information um you know granted you already

01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:20.760
noticed but maybe something let's just um then maybe catching this on uh the practice speed

01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:31.320
might not know uh i'm really heavy into um pc gaming um i i i'm on steam i'm on origin you play

01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:43.240
and dog and it's no state sacred that i am into deals however i do not have amazon prime or

01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:51.800
twitch prime uh now uh nearly because now my stuff a bit of a at a premium for me you know

01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:57.320
you know so it's kind of hard for me to afford stuff well yeah amazon prime is what 119 a year

01:58:57.320 --> 01:59:01.800
or something like that or you can do it monthly i'm actually okay monthly it's 12.95 a month all

01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:06.280
right but still i mean that is that is a luxury that's not you know something everybody if you're

01:59:06.280 --> 01:59:10.920
living on a budget or whatever that's not exactly you know you have to make choices you might be

01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:13.640
able to pay that 13 a month but you're gonna have to cut something else you know what i mean

01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:18.360
yeah that's an mmo subscription or whatever so yeah not everybody can just drop that money it is

01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:27.000
it is i guess a luxury yeah yeah honestly you know the only monthly bill you know if you want to call

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:35.640
such that pay is uh the ten dollars a month for xbox live um because i still have uh 360 but

01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:43.960
that's about it yeah all that being said no you know considering that i'm on these other services

01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:53.080
and all that uh would you recommend that uh plunk down however much twitch prime is to get the uh

01:59:53.080 --> 02:00:00.680
get these free games that they're giving out i'm thinking i'm quiet because i'm thinking um

02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:10.600
um i'm gonna say no and the reason why i say no is because if the gaming is the only reason you're

02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:14.360
getting into it especially when you don't have a lot of control over the games they're giving away

02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:18.360
i mean granted they do give away a few big ones here and there like the steam world dig two they

02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:22.360
did recently you know pillars of eternity but there's a lot of smaller indie titles not that

02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:26.840
those titles are bad but they're just probably not the stuff that you're really like seeking out or

02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:31.880
what have you um but here's the thing to consider and i think what might sway your decision one way

02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:37.560
or another remember that your prime is going to be more stuff than just the amazon prime again

02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:40.840
i fucking hate that i'm being a commercial for amazon when they're not getting this money but

02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:47.720
you know but i am telling this person maybe don't get by so but anyway you might want to wait would

02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:51.640
you use the other stuff do you ever buy stuff from amazon that you might want to get shipped

02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:57.320
for free two days do you have interest in the you know maybe if you were willing to get rid of

02:00:57.320 --> 02:01:02.600
netflix to pay for amazon i mean i don't even know if you have two days or less too because like i

02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:09.080
had something that i shipped that day and arrived that day yeah uh and then uh but there's also like

02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:14.440
the amazon uh streaming and the tv stuff if you think you would use some of that too then i think

02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:21.400
that sweetens the pot a lot but if you're doing it only for the games i don't know if i can

02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:26.360
heartily recommend it especially if you are someone who's savvy to getting free games

02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:31.560
somewhere else i mean are you gonna play the free games or are you just trying to build your catalog

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:40.200
yeah we're not really gonna buy the games the thing with me is um you know i very rarely order

02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:47.160
anything online be it through amazon or new york or wherever maybe if i'm like i might order

02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:59.080
something maybe once a year uh a couple months ago i ordered a new video card um but that's

02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:07.320
probably it and i already have cable tv i'm thinking of accident but even if i do ask that

02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:17.720
i get free videos to itunes on a regular basis they give away uh tv episodes left and right uh

02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:25.000
so it's not exactly like i'm hurting for content so it's kind of hard to justify

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:34.440
trying for that um i mean sure it's probably nice but you know for that alone you know i don't see

02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:43.800
myself being paying for that oh you were about to say something uh before i piped up i don't i

02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:48.680
i just no i mean i think at the end of the day i mean my my real answer is this really is your

02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:53.000
decision to make and yours alone and you know i'm not one to tell people how to spend their money

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:57.240
um but just you know knowing what i know from your your calls to the show and so forth and

02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:02.200
the fact that you know you you do you've said on the show before you you have like a strict budget

02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:07.080
that you have to adhere to and all that stuff i don't know if it's really worth it in your case

02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:11.720
you know if you if you come into a little extra money are you able to treat yourself to something

02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:15.880
for christmas maybe be a nice little bonus gift you know maybe that maybe that's where i'd put

02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:19.880
it for you put it on your gift list your wish list but i don't think you'd make it a priority

02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:29.400
yeah yeah yeah the thing is um not to get into to uh tmi but um i live on social security

02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:38.120
disability sure and uh that you know my monthly check just barely shy of 850 a month and roughly

02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:45.560
two-thirds of that alone goes towards my rent uh that's not not even getting to uh my spectrum bill

02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:53.720
and the money that i need to spend on let's say household supplies and personal hygiene supplies

02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:58.920
so and so forth and the only reason i i let you share all that is because i know you're not alone

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:06.040
in having that be you know what the cards that you have to deal with and being a gamer i know

02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:11.080
you're not alone in that somebody else out there listening is in a similar boat i know it so you

02:04:11.080 --> 02:04:18.600
know yeah yeah that's a life factor and why i'm always trying to promote deals you know uh and

02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:25.240
yeah i mean you know you know i'm probably a little more hired up in terms of finances than

02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:32.840
the average but no no no not everyone out there is going to be rich and making like uh five or

02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:37.400
six figure salaries to the job so sure sure and you know at the end of the day i'm gonna i'm gonna

02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:42.520
leave you with this you know at the end of the day if you want more free games to play and you're not

02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:47.160
getting them on the steam and the other deals and so forth you know what itch.io is a great

02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:51.480
playground yeah it's a lot of indie games there's a lot of stuff you may have never heard of but you

02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:56.760
know what minecraft was an indie game at one point too so the next great thing is out there

02:04:56.760 --> 02:05:03.400
somewhere you just got to find it and sadly great games sometimes don't get found like i don't think

02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:08.520
yyr's super multitasking is selling through the roof i'm not seeing it on the steam leaderboards

02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:12.280
i'm telling you guys it's a damn shame because that game is fucking awesome and you know i've

02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:18.120
been pronating but it just sometimes figuring out what's going to go viral in the gaming scene

02:05:18.120 --> 02:05:22.440
it can just it can be so hit and miss be so hit miss all right rage nader i'm gonna let you go

02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:27.400
but thank you so much for the call sure have a nice night yep you too bye-bye uh let's see if we

02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:31.160
get any more calls i'll take i'll take one more i know the call's been going a little long tonight

02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:35.640
but since we finished news like really fucking early why not let the calls go on a little long

02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:40.680
so i'll see if we can squeeze in one more call uh and then we'll call it a night orange lounge

02:05:40.680 --> 02:05:46.600
radio all one word on skype uh see a tiberian chat says it's not for everyone if you'll use

02:05:46.600 --> 02:05:53.160
it then it's great uh dungeon buster points out on itch.io itch.io has some great gems you might

02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:58.360
have to dig through a lot of other stuff to find what interests you but it can be worth it um

02:05:59.560 --> 02:06:05.320
you know another thing you could always do um since this whole conversation started around twitch

02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:11.800
anyway you know watch people play some games that's something you can do for free now look i

02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:17.640
don't want to you know devalue games by you know the the go spoil yourself on the story by watching

02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:22.920
the game but the fact of the matter is you know what if you can get a lot of entertainment out

02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:27.400
of watching somebody play the game too and being a part of communities and stuff on twitch you know

02:06:27.400 --> 02:06:31.960
there's a lot of uh stuff you know i know rage nader is a fan of the final fantasy series final

02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:37.560
fantasy 11 and so forth there's some great streamers for fantasy 14 out there as well as

02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:42.760
even fantasy 11 i found a final fantasy 11 live stream the other day did you yeah i'm like people

02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:48.680

02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:10.200
