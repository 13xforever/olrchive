Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:13.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight, rumors are growing that Google plans to compete in the video game console space. Would you be down for a Google Console? And more importantly, will you be able to play Fortnite Crossplay on it? All this and more on another episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello, my friends, and welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, July the 1st of 2018, episode number 736 of our show.

00:46.000 --> 00:57.000
Happy Canada Day to all of our pals up north. Happy We're Back night because we were off last week. No better way to celebrate a birthday of OLR than taking a week off.

00:57.000 --> 01:09.000
But we're back to start another year full of Orange Lounge Radio episodes after our 16th birthday two weeks ago. With you in studio, myself, Rob Roberts, and with me, as always, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Oh, hi.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Hello, hello.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Hello.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Thank you for cat-sitting Mr. Smoosh while I was away in Chicago. Appreciate it.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
He was a good kitty.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Had a very good time, and I brought you back some candy.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Yes, and I'm going to have some right now.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Good. Those little, so what do you call this place? Vosges?

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
V-O-S-G-E-S.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
Okay, so I'm assuming, they don't have them here. I'm assuming it's a thing in Chicago or maybe generally the Midwest.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
Actually, I did find that there's supposed to be one in New Orleans, and I think there's one in Southern California.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Oh, okay.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
But I didn't know about it.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
So maybe Southern California. So not really close to here.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Oh my God, it smells so good.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
But anyway, those peanut butter things I bought, those are the best things I've ever had in my entire life, as far as candy goes.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
So I'm really excited for Jamie to try one here on air. So she's going to open that box.

01:55.000 --> 02:03.000
I will say this too about Jamie is that she went with me to accompany me right before I left for Chicago,

02:03.000 --> 02:12.000
because she's been an owner of one of these devices, and I finally bit the bullet and bought myself for my birthday an Apple Watch.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
I said I would never get on the Apple Watch train, and here I am. I finally bought one.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
You know what finally did it for me? You know what finally brought me over to the dark side?

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
All the exercise motivating that it does.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
And I have to admit, the whole bugging me to stand up and all that stuff is actually really motivating.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Speaking of exercise, time for candy. So you're going to eat one of these?

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Got sea salt on top. Let's take a bite.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Alright, so she's going to eat one right now.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Oh, fucking hell.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Right?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Aren't those amazing?

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Praise Jesus. Now that I don't even believe in Jesus.

02:48.000 --> 02:56.000
Leave it to the resident Jewish girl here on the show to say praise Jesus for fighting into a chocolate.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
I love it. Alright. Yeah, I know. I know. I know. Alright.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Fucking A.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
While she's indulging in that, you need to, you need to put those, you know what you need to do?

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
You need to put those in a glass case, dark Sakura, which is like in case of shark week, break glass.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
And then you have those ready to go.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
Girl, it's so rich. I'm just going to sit here in the afterglow and smoke a cigarette.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Alright. Sounds good. Just blow the smoke outside.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
Alright. Say hello to tech master. Loki is also here. Hi, Loki.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Hi.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Hi. You may have to try to bribe your way to one of those chocolates later.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
I know you don't usually eat food.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Is it chocolate and peanut butter?

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
It's chocolate and peanut butter.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Yes.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
I fucking hate chocolate and peanut butter.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
God damn it, Loki. You hate everything.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
I did bring something else though that Loki might be interested in.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
What's that?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Honey butter potato chips.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I'll try some of those. That sounds good.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Maybe. That's just like weird.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
They're really fucking good.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
If it's not meat, Loki doesn't care. You know how to get Loki?

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
It tastes like the honey butter from, um, what was that salad place we used to have out here?

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Not sweet tomatoes, but, uh, the soup.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Fresh choice.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Fresh choice.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Yeah.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Yeah.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
It's really good.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
It is good. Anyway.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
But you, you brought dinner tonight from one of those make your own pizza places that they're

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
like, where did these things come from?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Like, it's like overnight we have, what is it?

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
The pizza rev, the pyology, the mod pizza, like all these.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Yeah.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Somebody took the idea of a Chipotle and applied it to pizza.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
All these places popped up like overnight.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
It's crazy.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
And it's just like, I didn't really necessarily want anything fancy.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
I just wanted pepperoni, you know, but I added a few extra things on top of it.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Garlic.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
But honestly, they're like, I like my LG better.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Like, I don't know.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
This is the first time I've had mod pizza and it's just kind of, it's all right.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
They're really all the same to me.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
They really, they're not all the same because they had different sauces and stuff and that stuff

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
does make a difference.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
All right.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
Uh, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com because part of what part of what makes Warren

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
songs radio special is the fact that we have been broadcasting live over the past 16 years.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
And we're always with you guys in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and you can chat

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
along with the show and say things like calling me a sheep, which some people are doing about

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
my new watch purchase.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
To which I say, fuck them.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
To which I say, suck it.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
All right.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
You know, you know what, know what people treat their technology like fucking religion

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
and you want to know what giving people shit about the technology that they like is just

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
as stupid as giving people shit for their religion.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
I don't like, honestly, it's not that important to me.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
I, if you want a Fitbit, get a Fitbit.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
I realized the newer Fitbits do like a lot of the same shit.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
If that's what you want, go ahead.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
I don't care.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Like it doesn't.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Okay.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
My Monique heart voice is kicking in here.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
Um, but, uh, I just do what you want.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
It's all good.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Just, you know, I just chose to get the Apple watch.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
I definitely wanted my rainbow band, which Jamie helped hook me up with.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
And then I have the little, the little face on the watch that does a little dancing rainbow

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
too.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
I got robbed for his birthday and I fed him and bought me.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Yes.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
I appreciate it.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Let's see.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Also looking in chat at live.vog network.com.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Uh, let's see.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
A rage in here talking about Loki hating chocolate and peanut butter together.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Yeah, I just don't.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I like them both individually.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
I just don't like the combination saying, uh, of course, Loki hates everything.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
He's a gamer.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Gamers hate everything.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Remember?

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
I like both.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
I just don't like the combination of flavors.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
I'm sorry.

06:23.000 --> 06:31.000
I like Nintendo switch and I like Xbox one, but how dare Minecraft put them together?

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
No, it's nothing like that.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Uh, let's see.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
It is a little confusing to have two copies of Minecraft though on my switch now.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
It is.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
Uh, tiger call on chat says, can Rob make calls on his Apple watch?

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
I think so, but I have the one.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
You absolutely can.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Yeah, but mine doesn't have the cellular cause I didn't need it.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
Like I do have an iPhone, so I was like, well, I always have my iPhone, so I'm not worried

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
about the whole, like you have to be near it.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
And I do notice they work pretty far apart still.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
And it's not like your watch immediately shuts down.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
If you get away from your phone, like it still tracks all the stuff.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
And then the next time you're close to your phone, it kind of, I can leave my watch in

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
the living room and I have to be about a house and a half away outside through the building

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
before it realizes I don't have my phone with me.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Yeah, yeah.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Same, same, same thing at work.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
So anyway, uh, let's see, we're going to get into, uh, some news stories here.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
In fact, I want to get into our kickoff topic tonight, uh, where I want to talk about some

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
of the things that we missed last week while we weren't here.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
Cause, uh, we did miss quite a few things last week, including official news that Yoshi

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
on the switch was delayed to 2019.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Everything's delayed to 2019.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
Kind of, well, I mean, and not too surprising when you figure that it didn't make the E3

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
press conference and a lot of people were asking, where's Yoshi?

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
So the fact that it got delayed to 2019, probably not the biggest surprise in the world.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
And honestly, is Nintendo doing anything different than the other companies?

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
Like practically all those games that Sony showed at their thing, except Spiderman are

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
2019 games.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
So you know what, whatever is last of us to 2019 as well.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
I believe I don't think they've committed to a date yet.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Have they?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
I don't know.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Anyway.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Um, let's see.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
Also, uh, I guess, uh, captain toad treasure tracker, speaking of Nintendo news, the world's

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
dedicated to super Mario three D world are being replaced by super Mario Odyssey ones,

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
which, okay.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
So it's not going to be a direct port of captain toad on Wii U.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Why not just put both in there?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
That's true.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Why not?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Oh, let's just take it out.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Why?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Maybe there'll be DLC.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
I don't know.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Who knows?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Uh, let's see.

08:35.000 --> 08:42.000
Nintendo and Disney are teaming up to make a Nintendo switch themed game show.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Nintendo switch family showdown.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
It is a new show that's going to be on the Disney channel, Disney XD, and I think online

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
the Disney or the Disney now streaming out cause you know, everybody has their own fucking

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
streaming app in this day and age.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
So anyway, four families will battle it out for points and prizes by playing Nintendo

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
switch games against each other.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
So it's kind of like, I guess like a modern day Nick arcade meets family double dare

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
or something.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
I don't know.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
Which by the way, speaking of game shows and speaking of double dare, Loki, I know you

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
had to have watched the new one.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
I didn't watch the new one, but I know it came back.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Yeah, no, it did come back.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
I didn't watch it either.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
Cause I was, I have no, I don't have Nickelodeon, so I don't really, I will know cause we don't

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
have cable.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
I thought, Oh, so I was like Nickelodeon.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I thought it was a part of like basic cable.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Okay.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
No, it's not actually basic.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
No.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Basic cable is your local channels and that's it.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
All right.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Well anyway, um, I know a lot of people were looking forward to the double dare.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
I like that they have a new host and they have Mark Summers.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I liked that they kind of used both.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
I thought that was a good way to kind of nod to the classic, but still keep it like very

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
modern.

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
So anyway, back to the Disney game show, uh, searching for collectibles in Mario Odyssey

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
might be one round head to head Mario tennis aces, just dance, dance off.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
So that'll be a hoot and a holler.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Anyway.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
I don't know.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
That sounds really stupid.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
It's, it's going to be a family game show.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
I get it, but it's just, it's hard to ignore the just product.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
It's, it's just, it's like an advertisement break man in chat wants to know, uh, when

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
is that coming out?

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Probably 2019 like everything else probably.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I don't think it's this year.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
I just took a bite of my other chocolate.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
So, okay.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
So not to derail, but that's what Jamie does.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
So you opened the other chocolate bar that I brought you, which was what it was a stout

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
chocolate bar.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
It's a burnt caramel smoke and stout, but it doesn't taste like caramel.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
So it's good.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
Um, but I can get the stout taste in it cause chocolate and Guinness are amazing together.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
It's got like a cream in it and you have to let me try like a little bite at some point

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
just cause I'm curious.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Super curious.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
All right.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Anyway, go ahead and have some.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I'm trying to do a show here.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Girl, put this in your mouth and eat it.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
If you insist.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
All right.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Hold on.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Okay.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
That is pretty fucking good.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Right.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
You want some?

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
That's pretty amazing.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Moki hates everything you forgot.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
All right.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
I would still be ready to find it and offer.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
Um, the cross platform debates heat up.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
I think we're going to get into it a little bit on tonight's show as well.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
But, um, I think you guys probably saw the commercial that showed up, uh, on Twitter

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
at least.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
I think it's, um, around social media and stuff.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
The whole survive together.

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
There's a Minecraft ad that's full on Microsoft and Nintendo did this ad together and there's

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
an Xbox player and a Nintendo player.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
And it's really cute because the Xbox player is wearing green, the Nintendo players weren't

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
playing red.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
It's, isn't it interesting how like we have the three, like, I know they're not the three

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
primary colors.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
I guess they're the three light colors, red, green, blue, right?

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Cause I know primary is red, yellow, blue, but Xbox is green.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
Nintendo is now red and Sony is blue.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
So we have a green and a red commercial that came together and it says survive together.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
It's really cute.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Did you see the commercial?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Yes.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Yeah.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
So it's a, and then of course that led to all these parodies where people were making

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
like a blue screen that said survive alone, you know, things like that kind of taking

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
jabs at Sony.

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
But anyway, uh, an ex Sony developer said that the PlayStation four console cross platform

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
block is all about the money.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Uh, duh.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
We all know it's about greed and we all know it's about Sony just trying to sit on their

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
little throne.

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
But the problem is this little reputation is going to hurt them in the long, the long

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
game is not good with a strategy.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
That's the problem with this.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
People are going to fucking remember this when the Xbox two isn't, I'd call it, we all

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
know it's not going to be called that, but when the next Xbox is announced, Sony can't

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
stick to these types of rules or they're only going to allow Microsoft to punch them the

12:41.000 --> 12:46.000
way that they punched Microsoft at E3 a few years ago when they first failed PS4.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
So just look out Sony, don't do this.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
All right.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
Anyway, uh, let's see other news from last week.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Final Fantasy seven remake.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
It is still happening.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
Tetsuya Nomura expressing a little regret that they announced it so early, but they

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
kind of had to because of all the rumors and talk, you know, uh, also they're saying the

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
remake will dive deeper into avalanche members and other characters, which makes me think

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
that this isn't so much a remake as it is a re-imagining if they're expanding on certain

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
elements of the story and changing things like this.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
That's not really a remake, is it?

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Remakes can be, you know, covering different stuff.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
I guess that's true.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
I guess so.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
But doesn't that seem more like a re-imagining Logie?

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
Maybe a little bit, but I hope that they have more like the advent children's stuff in there.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Yeah.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Let's go even beyond the story.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
Uh, some thoughts in our chat at live.vognetwork.com.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
Uh, as Joe and Hunter Matt said, they needed to announce it before Walmart Canada announced

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
it.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Very true.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
Uh, JD says maybe they're pulling in some of the prequel games like crisis core before

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
crisis.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Oh, so kind of like alluding to some of the other things that happen in the side stories.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
That's a good, a billion of side story games that they had good call out, I suppose.

13:57.000 --> 14:04.000
Uh, and then one of the biggest stories that came out the week we were gone, uh, evil G

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
or GameStop, but we sometimes call them evil G.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
Uh, they're in talks with private firms about a buyout.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
So it looks like you also heard the other story though too.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
What's that?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
They're going to carry comics.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Yeah, I did hear that too.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
So GameStop is definitely having to change a little bit probably because of the ramp

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
up in more and more games being distributed digitally.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
So they're not content with putting the, the local, uh, video game stores out of business.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
They're also now aiming for the jugular for the comic book industry.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
They're trying to, they're basically trying to diversify cause there's no margin in games.

14:37.000 --> 14:43.000
And so even with game sales, you know, and I imagine even less so with digital stuff,

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
they're not making a lot of money on that.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
And I'm guessing that maybe the used market's not what it used to be.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
And so now they're making money from other things that are higher margin, like, you know,

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
collectibles, 50% pop figures.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
It is, it is.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
And you know, judging by my kids and stuff, most of their attention was on all the collectible

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
stuff that they had there and not so much the games.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
So these are basically going to become nerd stores across America.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
It's probably like a, like a hot topic, but just gaming centric.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Interesting.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Isn't that box lunch?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Box lunch is actually a lot better than hot topic.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I like, I like box lunch a lot personally.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Yeah.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
I have the stuff in there.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
They had a Retsuko shirt I want, but they wanted like 40 bucks for it.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
So whatever.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Do they have those?

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
I don't know if everybody in our chat would know what that store is, but it's in like,

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
if you go to this place called the mall, which most towns still have them, not all.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Wait, wait, wait.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Sorry.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
It's where your Sears used to be.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
A line from a movie pops in my head.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
He took us to something called the mall and something called credit cards.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Sorry.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Is Bill and Ted's excellent.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Oh my God.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
That's, that's a throwback.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
I was thinking mall rats.

15:49.000 --> 15:56.000
If you want to see like malls at their heyday height, go check out mall rats with Jay and

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
silent Bob.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Pay attention to the name of the stores.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Yeah.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
And see if you can see the stereo image.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Anyway.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Uh, where were we?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Oh yes.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
GameStop malls.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Yeah.

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
Oh, and also, you know, along the lines of GameStop looking for a buyer, you know, Toys

16:13.000 --> 16:18.560
R Us is officially closed now that I saw the memes of the Jeffrey with his bags packed,

16:18.560 --> 16:23.120
ready to go and all the, you know, because I missed the last day, I was hoping to go

16:23.120 --> 16:24.800
like one more time before they closed.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.360
They didn't really have anything in there though.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.840
I guy looked, there was nothing.

16:27.840 --> 16:31.800
I did not set foot into a Toys R Us one time during that entire sale.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.340
What do I win?

16:34.340 --> 16:36.600
You win not getting stuff for really cheap.

16:36.600 --> 16:37.600
No.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.040
Well, isn't it all going to end up at the dollar store now anyway?

16:40.040 --> 16:41.600
No, they'd sold it off.

16:41.600 --> 16:45.760
I mean, well I think like a lot of like, especially like I was looking at Legos, so a lot of Lego

16:45.760 --> 16:46.760
stuff that was there.

16:46.760 --> 16:51.480
I think the local hobby shop that sells Legos bought most of that because you know, it's

16:51.480 --> 16:52.480
50% off.

16:52.480 --> 16:53.480
That reminds me.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.480
I got you something.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.000
You know, they could throw the markup stuff.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Oh yeah.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
The Lego tape stuff.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
That's awesome.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
It was like the last one they had.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
What is that?

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
It's tape.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.680
You like stick it on your wall and you can stick stuff to it.

17:04.680 --> 17:05.680
That's cool.

17:05.760 --> 17:06.760
Thank you.

17:06.760 --> 17:11.880
Um, but yeah, they, I saw, I got like a nice sign, you know, save like 80 bucks off of

17:11.880 --> 17:12.880
it.

17:12.880 --> 17:13.880
Huh?

17:13.880 --> 17:17.080
I bought one of those and I bought Jenga, but it was like not real Jenga.

17:17.080 --> 17:21.520
They had like my, uh, I was speaking with my mom yesterday and she went there and bought

17:21.520 --> 17:24.600
Christmas gifts for the kids because they had a lot of stuff and there was a lot of

17:24.600 --> 17:28.280
like big ticket items that my kids wanted and I'm like, I wish this was cheaper.

17:28.280 --> 17:32.120
Um, so I was waiting for it to go cheaper and that's why it was actually, that was my

17:32.120 --> 17:35.080
next trip was going to be is buying that stuff for Christmas.

17:35.080 --> 17:38.280
So maybe she took care of that.

17:38.280 --> 17:42.360
Um, something that I noticed in our little, uh, thread where we compile all the stories

17:42.360 --> 17:46.680
where a dark Tetsuya helps us out and some of our story compilation for each show, uh,

17:46.680 --> 17:51.000
he kind of called this out as a piece from last week that he thought was worth mentioning

17:51.000 --> 17:55.800
and dark soccer since this has to do with retro games, namely SNK, I think this is something

17:55.800 --> 17:59.680
that probably be up your alley, but you know how they're doing this SNK 40th anniversary

17:59.680 --> 18:01.440
collection that's coming out later this year.

18:01.440 --> 18:04.740
That's kind of like the, you know, all the old school games in one package.

18:04.740 --> 18:10.920
Apparently, uh, some of the games have been redesigned to work as twin stick games because

18:10.920 --> 18:16.200
some games, well, some games originally had a rotary control, so that can't be replicated

18:16.200 --> 18:20.100
on a controller because the rotary is kind of unique in its design.

18:20.100 --> 18:25.460
So what happened is that, you know, the ports were mapping buttons to rotate clockwise or

18:25.460 --> 18:27.660
counterclockwise and it just didn't work.

18:27.660 --> 18:31.240
So now the games play as twin stick basically.

18:31.240 --> 18:35.800
So instead of, you know, turn it, you basically have one to point, I guess like, uh, you know,

18:35.800 --> 18:36.800
playing like what?

18:36.800 --> 18:39.100
Smash TV, robotron, those types of games.

18:39.100 --> 18:40.100
So that's kind of cool.

18:40.100 --> 18:41.100
That's pretty cool.

18:41.100 --> 18:42.100
Yeah.

18:42.100 --> 18:45.280
So, uh, I developed, I was already sold on this collection anyway, cause I'm a sucker

18:45.280 --> 18:47.080
for retro compilations.

18:47.080 --> 18:50.220
So that just makes me, uh, all the more interested in this.

18:50.220 --> 18:51.220
That's for sure.

18:51.220 --> 18:52.760
So there you go.

18:52.760 --> 18:57.920
So that's a little bit of what y'all missed last week while we were off.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.820
You also missed Rob's birthday.

19:00.820 --> 19:01.820
That's right.

19:01.820 --> 19:02.820
Yes.

19:02.820 --> 19:05.180
My 40th birthday was on Monday.

19:05.180 --> 19:06.580
Tuesday was on Tuesday.

19:06.580 --> 19:07.580
Yeah.

19:07.580 --> 19:08.580
I'm at that age where I forget.

19:08.580 --> 19:09.580
Yeah.

19:09.580 --> 19:10.580
My 40th birthday was Tuesday.

19:10.580 --> 19:12.220
Your 40 Stravaganza.

19:12.220 --> 19:13.220
I didn't forget.

19:13.220 --> 19:20.220
So I figured, you know, as a gift to not only the listeners, but to Rob, you know, okay.

19:20.220 --> 19:25.200
So because I, it's more for Rob, but you know, the listeners I'm sure can enjoy, you know,

19:25.200 --> 19:27.500
being that I have no idea what's coming by the way.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.980
He is not, he just said that there's a birthday present.

19:30.140 --> 19:31.140
Yes.

19:31.140 --> 19:33.900
And, and, and Bobby will appreciate this.

19:33.900 --> 19:37.340
So I'll be right back and I'll bring you one in.

19:37.340 --> 19:38.340
Okay.

19:38.340 --> 19:40.340
Oh Lord.

19:40.340 --> 19:42.220
Did he, he hid something.

19:42.220 --> 19:43.680
He's bringing you ahead.

19:43.680 --> 19:44.680
I know.

19:44.680 --> 19:45.680
I'm fucking scared.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.780
That means it was too big to hide.

19:47.780 --> 19:48.940
So he dropped it in the living room.

19:48.940 --> 19:49.940
Oh my God.

19:49.940 --> 19:50.940
This is gigantic.

19:50.940 --> 19:51.940
What the fuck is this?

19:51.940 --> 19:52.940
Oh my God.

19:52.940 --> 19:53.940
Oh shit.

19:53.940 --> 19:54.940
Oh my God.

19:54.940 --> 19:55.940
I'm scared.

19:55.940 --> 19:56.940
This is.

19:56.940 --> 19:57.940
What?

19:57.940 --> 20:02.260
I figured since you've been putting it off for too long, it's about time that you got

20:02.260 --> 20:06.040
on the whole VR craze.

20:06.040 --> 20:10.820
So not only you got that, but also one of my favorite games on the system, which is

20:10.820 --> 20:16.020
uh, until Don Russia, he bought me a PS VR, I can't believe it.

20:16.020 --> 20:17.020
And it does.

20:17.020 --> 20:18.020
Yep.

20:18.020 --> 20:19.020
It has Skyrim.

20:19.020 --> 20:20.020
Cool.

20:20.020 --> 20:21.020
They all have Skyrim nowadays.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.020
Thank you so much.

20:22.020 --> 20:23.020
Oh my God.

20:23.020 --> 20:24.020
I'm like speechless.

20:24.020 --> 20:25.020
It's great.

20:25.020 --> 20:26.020
You know, who's going to be mad at you though?

20:26.020 --> 20:27.020
What?

20:27.100 --> 20:31.420
Because just to, just before I left for Chicago, I was like, Oh, when I get back from Chicago,

20:31.420 --> 20:33.380
I'll look into buy your PS VR.

20:33.380 --> 20:34.380
Oops.

20:34.380 --> 20:35.380
Oops.

20:35.380 --> 20:37.860
No, I love it.

20:37.860 --> 20:39.380
Oh, there's something else in here.

20:39.380 --> 20:40.380
Yeah.

20:40.380 --> 20:41.380
Until Dawn.

20:41.380 --> 20:42.380
Cause it sets.

20:42.380 --> 20:43.380
Oh no.

20:43.380 --> 20:44.380
It's a great game.

20:44.380 --> 20:46.740
Oh no.

20:46.740 --> 20:47.740
I love it though.

20:47.740 --> 20:48.740
Thank you.

20:48.740 --> 20:49.740
Look, you really did.

20:49.740 --> 20:50.740
I know these things aren't cheap.

20:50.740 --> 20:51.740
Thank you so much.

20:51.740 --> 20:52.740
Holy shit.

20:52.740 --> 20:53.740
No problem.

20:53.740 --> 20:54.740
Wow.

20:54.740 --> 20:56.020
So I figured it'd be fun because you know, you do the streaming stuff and everything.

20:56.020 --> 20:57.380
So Oh, for sure.

20:57.380 --> 21:00.380
And I am super looking forward to Tetris effect.

21:00.380 --> 21:01.380
Exactly.

21:01.380 --> 21:02.380
That was finally the thing.

21:02.380 --> 21:03.380
Well, let me go.

21:03.380 --> 21:04.380
Okay.

21:04.380 --> 21:05.380
I have games already.

21:05.380 --> 21:06.380
So you have rez.

21:06.380 --> 21:07.380
Yep.

21:07.380 --> 21:08.380
You know, I get to play rez.

21:08.380 --> 21:09.380
Oh my God.

21:09.380 --> 21:10.380
I'm so excited.

21:10.380 --> 21:11.380
Yeah.

21:11.380 --> 21:12.380
Super excited.

21:12.380 --> 21:14.380
Looking in chat over at live.vog network.com.

21:14.380 --> 21:18.100
Uh, as 200 Matt says, Mr. Smoosh is like a new thing.

21:18.100 --> 21:19.100
That's mine now.

21:19.100 --> 21:20.100
Yep.

21:20.100 --> 21:21.100
Uh, blowing shit up.

21:21.100 --> 21:24.140
Man says everybody gets a Skyrim and dark Tetsuya says, Oh man, I want to see that on

21:24.140 --> 21:25.140
Twitch.

21:25.260 --> 21:26.260
You got it.

21:26.260 --> 21:28.300
We'll do, we'll do some Twitch streams for the PS4 later this week.

21:28.300 --> 21:32.220
I can't, I can't do it tonight cause I'm not going to get set up that fast, but uh, this

21:32.220 --> 21:33.220
week for sure.

21:33.220 --> 21:34.220
That's great.

21:34.220 --> 21:35.220
Oh my God.

21:35.220 --> 21:36.220
Thank you so much.

21:36.220 --> 21:37.220
They have most of the games are digital.

21:37.220 --> 21:39.020
So you have to get some digital games.

21:39.020 --> 21:43.180
Like I just, I picked up like some stuff this week by seven played it yet.

21:43.180 --> 21:50.140
Uh, just in time ink, which is kind of a cross between like if you think, um, super hot and

21:50.140 --> 21:51.520
job simulator.

21:51.520 --> 21:55.720
So you, you're trying to stop people from dying from tragedies.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.940
And so it's, it's hilarious though.

21:57.940 --> 22:01.560
So like I really want to play that, but that'd be a great like streaming game right there.

22:01.560 --> 22:07.460
Uh, rage nator in chat says, now that Rob Roberts has a PSVR, I have to ask the million

22:07.460 --> 22:08.460
dollar question.

22:08.460 --> 22:12.240
What is the TTP with the PSVR?

22:12.240 --> 22:13.660
First off, you nasty.

22:13.660 --> 22:16.920
Second off, how do you know it hasn't already happened?

22:16.920 --> 22:19.960
Just don't be nasty.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.920
Maybe I'll do a Twitch stream with no pants.

22:21.920 --> 22:22.920
You'll never know.

22:22.920 --> 22:23.920
You'll never know.

22:23.920 --> 22:24.920
All right.

22:24.920 --> 22:25.920
Anyway.

22:25.920 --> 22:26.920
Nasty, nasty.

22:26.920 --> 22:27.920
Uh, let's see.

22:27.920 --> 22:32.660
Uh, going to chat at live.vognetwork.com, uh, dungeon buster says I can only imagine

22:32.660 --> 22:34.540
what it's like in VR, but I liked it.

22:34.540 --> 22:36.040
Good luck on saving everyone.

22:36.040 --> 22:40.460
Uh, tiger claw wants you to know is if you don't already Loki ready player one is coming

22:40.460 --> 22:43.600
out digitally this Tuesday already pre-ordered the digital version.

22:43.600 --> 22:46.680
Yeah, I'm in no hurry to get the digital version again.

22:46.680 --> 22:49.360
I mean, I've already seen it like two or three times.

22:49.360 --> 22:51.680
So yeah, okay.

22:51.680 --> 22:55.360
I wanted to go see ant man and the loss this weekend.

22:55.360 --> 23:01.620
However, I have been informed by my wife that the Whitney Houston documentary is coming

23:01.620 --> 23:03.880
to theaters that same day.

23:03.880 --> 23:08.280
So unfortunately I will be seeing that instead.

23:08.280 --> 23:19.320
So, Oh, well, I'll have to see it on the weekend.

23:19.760 --> 23:24.400
I still, I, I can't wrap my hand around that.

23:24.400 --> 23:28.440
It's not about learning your spouse to see something they don't want to see.

23:28.440 --> 23:31.440
I would take your wife to see the Whitney Houston documentary cause I would see that.

23:31.440 --> 23:32.440
I didn't even know one was coming.

23:32.440 --> 23:35.600
I knew there's a mr Rogers documentary that I want to see.

23:35.600 --> 23:36.600
Yeah.

23:36.600 --> 23:37.600
Maybe you guys can negotiate.

23:37.600 --> 23:38.600
See that one.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.320
But like if Dan was like, Hey, I'm going to go see this.

23:40.320 --> 23:41.320
You want to go?

23:41.320 --> 23:45.160
I'd be like, no, that's, that's with me.

23:45.160 --> 23:49.160
That's Alan and scary movies when he wants to go see, I don't know what are the big scary

23:49.200 --> 23:50.200
moves?

23:50.200 --> 23:51.200
It, he wants to go see it.

23:51.200 --> 23:56.520
I'm like, don't you have other friends locally that want to go see it like, you know, that

23:56.520 --> 23:57.520
that's everything.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.520
He's free.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.520
All right.

23:59.520 --> 24:02.120
I mean, I went and saw, was it the bodyguard musical and everything?

24:02.120 --> 24:05.200
So I mean, I forgot with, uh, uh, who was it?

24:05.200 --> 24:06.200
Crystal waters, right?

24:06.200 --> 24:07.200
Or something?

24:07.200 --> 24:08.200
No.

24:08.200 --> 24:09.200
Uh, one of those divas from the nineties.

24:09.200 --> 24:10.200
Right.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.200
Here's somebody, but I don't remember who it was.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.200
Yeah.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.200
But it was all right.

24:13.200 --> 24:15.200
I mean, it was okay.

24:15.200 --> 24:16.200
Okay.

24:16.720 --> 24:18.000
Was it right?

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
But it's okay.

24:19.000 --> 24:25.000
Were you going to make it any way stop?

24:25.000 --> 24:29.400
You want to know how many freaking drag queens I've heard do that song?

24:29.400 --> 24:30.400
All of them.

24:30.400 --> 24:31.400
All right.

24:31.400 --> 24:32.400
All of them, Rob, all of them.

24:32.400 --> 24:36.600
Let's get into how is your gaming week and the types of video games that you've been

24:36.600 --> 24:38.120
playing this week?

24:38.120 --> 24:39.120
Uh, dark soccer.

24:39.120 --> 24:40.160
How was your gaming week?

24:40.160 --> 24:43.160
I didn't play a damn thing except for the stuff I play on the phone.

24:43.160 --> 24:44.880
You want to know why?

24:44.880 --> 24:47.640
Because of awesome games done quick.

24:47.640 --> 24:56.560
I'm also right now buying a legend of Zelda t-shirt, but anyway, back to this, um, I have

24:56.560 --> 25:00.400
been playing Pokemon and I've been playing, um, idle pouring.

25:00.400 --> 25:06.360
Um, but I really like, I watched the finale last night so I could watch the final fantasy

25:06.360 --> 25:10.040
six play through and I really super enjoyed it.

25:10.040 --> 25:13.040
And it was just so much memory on that, that I think I'm actually planning on starting

25:13.040 --> 25:19.780
that up again, um, to play on my, um, um, my, uh, SNES classic.

25:19.780 --> 25:26.080
So I'm thinking about it anyway, but that's really been about what I've been doing anyway

25:26.080 --> 25:33.560
just because I really haven't wanted to do anything else.

25:33.560 --> 25:34.560
All right.

25:34.560 --> 25:35.560
Then we'll move on to Loki.

25:35.560 --> 25:41.280
Um, I didn't play a whole ton of stuff this week, but I did play, um, I got luminous remastered.

25:41.280 --> 25:44.600
So I played a little bit of that on the switch and it was fine.

25:44.600 --> 25:52.960
Um, I tried a little bit of the new Minecraft for the switch, so it's kind of confusing

25:52.960 --> 25:53.960
that.

25:53.960 --> 25:56.680
So they have the Minecraft switch edition, which is its own thing.

25:56.680 --> 26:02.400
And then the Minecraft that's kind of everybody, you know, the one that's tied in with, um,

26:02.400 --> 26:07.640
Xbox live, the one that you can play cross platform on is its own thing, which is really

26:07.640 --> 26:08.840
weird.

26:08.840 --> 26:13.080
And then on top of that, like I don't really care for the port that they did for that one

26:13.080 --> 26:20.320
because it's probably good on TV, but on the screen, they didn't account for the size of

26:20.320 --> 26:22.120
the screen and the resolution.

26:22.120 --> 26:28.200
So all of the text boxes are really small and it makes it kind of difficult to see what

26:28.200 --> 26:30.200
you're doing in there.

26:30.200 --> 26:33.040
I mean, whatever, that's a small nitpick, but it's kind of annoying.

26:33.040 --> 26:37.280
It's like, ah, I kind of rather play the other one that would look much nicer, but whatever.

26:37.280 --> 26:42.380
I just wish you had an option to like tweak some of that stuff, but whatever, it's, it's

26:42.380 --> 26:43.380
all good.

26:43.380 --> 26:44.560
The aquatic updates are pretty awesome.

26:44.560 --> 26:49.200
I haven't really played too much of it on my PC, so I'll have to check that out.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.160
But yeah, it was kind of fun.

26:51.160 --> 26:55.560
Most of my time was playing Pokemon go just because I feel obligated now to get enough

26:55.560 --> 26:57.840
gifts to send to everybody every single day.

26:57.840 --> 27:03.840
And so it's the struggle, it's just like I have 11 friends and it's just like, dude,

27:03.840 --> 27:08.880
I had to drive by all of these pokey stops to get stuff and it's just, you have to let

27:08.880 --> 27:10.140
it go at some point.

27:10.140 --> 27:13.800
Now again, I got into this on Bobby show a little bit.

27:13.800 --> 27:17.160
I'm not trying to be that guy, but the reality is between the people I know that play ingress

27:17.160 --> 27:21.580
between the people on Facebook, Twitter, I have 73 friends on Pokemon go.

27:21.580 --> 27:24.240
So like I'm, I'm not going to be able to send out that many gifts a day.

27:24.240 --> 27:28.480
I just, I just can't, like I physically cannot visit 73 pokey stops in a day and that's assuming

27:28.480 --> 27:31.640
each stop gives me a gift, which is not even the case.

27:31.660 --> 27:36.640
So I kind of have to prioritize like who are the local people that I'm more likely to raid

27:36.640 --> 27:39.920
with and trade with because I want to increase those friendships faster.

27:39.920 --> 27:44.320
It's like, I'll send gifts out to the long distance people as I can, but like, yeah,

27:44.320 --> 27:49.840
Oh my God, I just, I don't get enough gifts and they did nerf it a bit cause you were

27:49.840 --> 27:54.540
getting like a ton of stuff from those gifts and then now it's a little less, but I mean,

27:54.540 --> 27:55.920
I'm still having trouble like key.

27:55.920 --> 28:00.360
I've had to expand my inventory twice just to be able to keep up with everything and

28:00.360 --> 28:02.760
it's still not enough.

28:02.760 --> 28:04.200
I'm like, I'm trying to catch everything.

28:04.200 --> 28:08.720
I literally am catching everything I see, even if I don't want it just to use up the

28:08.720 --> 28:12.180
pokey balls and it's not enough.

28:12.180 --> 28:15.720
I just can't, I can't throw enough of them away.

28:15.720 --> 28:18.200
So that's what, that's why I played this week.

28:18.200 --> 28:19.200
All right.

28:19.200 --> 28:23.040
Um, my gaming week, uh, I've also played the brand new Luminous remastered on Nintendo

28:23.040 --> 28:24.040
Switch.

28:24.040 --> 28:26.280
I'll probably play it after the show tonight on the live streams.

28:26.280 --> 28:27.280
That'll be fun.

28:27.280 --> 28:30.920
Um, but, um, yeah, I'm, I'm a fan, obviously.

28:30.920 --> 28:33.640
I love that they redid Luminous.

28:33.640 --> 28:37.980
It is pretty much the original game, but this time, you know, I can play on my HDTV as opposed

28:37.980 --> 28:39.480
to a little portable device.

28:39.480 --> 28:40.480
So that's cool.

28:40.480 --> 28:44.440
And like I realized that they did do a version of Luminous on Xbox 360, they did do a version

28:44.440 --> 28:48.600
of it on PC, you know, so it's not like I haven't played Luminous on my TV before, but

28:48.600 --> 28:53.420
it's the first opportunity to play those old skins, you know, shine in, move your body

28:53.420 --> 28:56.000
and like, you know, those, those like older skins from that game.

28:56.040 --> 28:58.280
Um, so it's really cool to get to experience all that again.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.780
And the fact that it's on the Switch, you know, being portable and all that stuff.

29:00.780 --> 29:01.780
Very cool.

29:01.780 --> 29:05.120
So, uh, yeah, big fan of shine it or of shine it, of lumen.

29:05.120 --> 29:10.600
I mean, what else is there in Luminous, it's shine in the game, but no, seriously, a big

29:10.600 --> 29:11.620
fan of Luminous.

29:11.620 --> 29:17.360
If you've never played it and you like puzzle games at all, you have to give this a try.

29:17.360 --> 29:20.920
If you like music games, I kind of feel like you have to give this a try.

29:20.920 --> 29:25.160
Now, if you're not a fan of puzzle games, then I don't think this one's going to win

29:25.160 --> 29:30.120
you over, you know, because you're probably, you're probably going to look at it and go,

29:30.120 --> 29:31.680
it's kind of like the same thing over and over.

29:31.680 --> 29:35.040
Like if you can't see the value in a game like Tetris, then you're not going to see

29:35.040 --> 29:36.720
it in Luminous either.

29:36.720 --> 29:40.200
But like, have you seen, speaking of Tetris, by the way, have you guys seen some of the

29:40.200 --> 29:43.560
gameplay that's out there now for Tetris effects because now that I don't know if critics have

29:43.560 --> 29:49.600
a copy of it or somehow, like I know it was at E3, but like, there's like off the screen

29:49.600 --> 29:53.400
or like a direct feed B roll stuff out there.

29:53.400 --> 29:57.040
It is, it is Luminous, but Tetris.

29:57.040 --> 30:01.240
It is like the exact same, like the themes and the block change after you get so many

30:01.240 --> 30:03.080
like lines and stuff.

30:03.080 --> 30:07.640
And the thing they did to Tetris, they made it so that you can stop time.

30:07.640 --> 30:12.600
And so you can actually get up to 16 clears at one, you can get 16 lines at a time.

30:12.600 --> 30:13.840
Pretty crazy stuff.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.640
The expert Tetris player did.

30:15.640 --> 30:16.640
Yes.

30:16.640 --> 30:17.640
Yeah.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.220
That's the same thing I saw that YouTube out there, which I guess a ton of people have

30:19.220 --> 30:20.220
seen that.

30:20.460 --> 30:25.180
Just Google or look on YouTube for Tetris effect expert player or something, and you'll

30:25.180 --> 30:29.340
find this video and it has a lot of footage from the game and you can see the expert Tetris

30:29.340 --> 30:30.340
player.

30:30.340 --> 30:33.580
I think they showed like footage of him from like the NES world championships in the nineties

30:33.580 --> 30:34.640
or something.

30:34.640 --> 30:39.820
So he's in his forties now like me and he's like a Tetris master and he was playing that

30:39.820 --> 30:40.820
game.

30:40.820 --> 30:45.040
So, yeah, I'm so excited for Tetris effects, you guys and like Luminous is just like warming

30:45.040 --> 30:46.040
me up to that.

30:46.040 --> 30:50.620
Otherwise, I've also been playing a lot of Pokemon Go.

30:50.620 --> 30:54.560
Same kind of deal that Loki was talking about, except, you know, just trying to get all the

30:54.560 --> 30:55.560
presents I can.

30:55.560 --> 30:59.160
So again, if you're my friend in Pokemon Go and I haven't been sending you enough gifts

30:59.160 --> 31:02.240
or opening your gifts, I am sorry.

31:02.240 --> 31:05.000
Blame Niantic for only letting me open 20 a day.

31:05.000 --> 31:09.840
They should still let you open gifts, even if you only get like a Pokeball or a potion

31:09.840 --> 31:13.920
or just like experience or something like just a little something to let you open all

31:13.920 --> 31:14.920
your gifts would be great.

31:14.920 --> 31:16.640
At least you can send out unlimited.

31:16.640 --> 31:19.620
But again, trying to try to get that many is a beast.

31:19.620 --> 31:24.820
But I am trying to prioritize people that like I raid with, I trade with that are like

31:24.820 --> 31:27.420
local where I'm going to see those benefits.

31:27.420 --> 31:31.480
So sorry about that anyway.

31:31.480 --> 31:32.480
Let's see.

31:32.480 --> 31:35.720
And then there's no shiny Roselia, though, which disappoints me.

31:35.720 --> 31:36.720
I've been trying.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.960
I don't really like that Pokemon in the beginning.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.960
They're like, OK, there's a shiny one out there.

31:40.960 --> 31:45.280
Just like everyone I've seen is like not shiny by not a shiny by.

31:45.280 --> 31:49.220
Well, I guess the reason why they did that is this safari zone event they're doing in

31:49.220 --> 31:53.600
Europe right now, which is kind of like Europe's own community day sort of thing.

31:53.600 --> 31:58.360
I guess it's happening at a rose garden or it's some type of like botanical gardens.

31:58.360 --> 32:00.120
So that's that's why they did Roselia.

32:00.120 --> 32:01.120
Yes, it makes sense.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.160
I just, you know, I can't evolve it.

32:03.160 --> 32:09.080
So it's like, well, I mean, not yet, but it's a Gen Gen four or five has a evolve.

32:09.080 --> 32:10.440
I think it's Gen four.

32:10.440 --> 32:14.800
Gen four has so many like game breaking Pokemon for the current system.

32:14.800 --> 32:18.520
Like this is why we're having to wait a little bit for Gen four, because I think Gen four

32:18.520 --> 32:21.180
is going to require a rebalance of everything.

32:21.180 --> 32:24.800
And so I'm not sure how popular that's going to be.

32:24.800 --> 32:27.980
Act Deft in our chat room points out at live dot vog network dot com.

32:27.980 --> 32:31.380
The go fest shinies are going to be minion and plusle.

32:31.380 --> 32:35.720
So the little the little battery pikachus, you all know which ones those are right.

32:35.720 --> 32:36.720
Plus minus pikachus.

32:36.720 --> 32:39.960
Yeah, those are the ones that are going to be shiny for Chicago.

32:39.960 --> 32:44.120
But they'll be it'll be worldwide like the Roselia was, but they're so weak.

32:44.120 --> 32:45.700
I know they're not my favorite either.

32:45.700 --> 32:47.040
And I don't think those do evolve.

32:47.040 --> 32:48.440
I don't think those ever go anywhere.

32:48.440 --> 32:50.200
I'd I could be wrong.

32:50.200 --> 32:53.760
Chatters, Pokemon experts, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I've been catching a

32:53.760 --> 32:56.160
lot of those too lately, but it's just like they're so weak.

32:56.160 --> 32:57.680
Yeah, I don't think they go in.

32:57.680 --> 33:00.440
They don't go into the Pikachu chain at all.

33:00.440 --> 33:01.440
They're kind of separate.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.440
So let's see.

33:03.440 --> 33:08.720
S.J. 100 Matt says spots that don't get too much pogo traffic have better odds of getting

33:08.720 --> 33:09.720
shinies.

33:09.720 --> 33:10.720
Interesting.

33:10.720 --> 33:15.380
I thought kind of the friends list was an interesting way to help players in rural areas.

33:15.380 --> 33:19.440
Because you know, if I know people that are in rural areas that don't get to spin pokestops,

33:19.440 --> 33:21.840
imagine getting to open 20 gifts in a day.

33:21.840 --> 33:24.240
Like you're able to get gear, which is nice.

33:24.240 --> 33:29.720
So anyway, other games I've been playing this week still playing Diablo three.

33:29.720 --> 33:34.840
So my seasonal character I mentioned before the last show, I wasn't 70 yet.

33:34.840 --> 33:39.440
So now I'm 70 Paragon 300 plus I hit Paragon 300 earlier today.

33:39.440 --> 33:45.400
So thanks to some of Grandpa from Hoard House or Captain Matt from Starboard Power Coupling.

33:45.400 --> 33:48.040
Thanks to his friends for power leveling.

33:48.040 --> 33:52.180
We were doing like level 75 greater rifts.

33:52.180 --> 33:56.680
I gained 64 Paragon levels in one run.

33:56.680 --> 33:57.680
One of those was crazy.

33:57.680 --> 33:58.680
So that was fun.

33:58.680 --> 34:03.200
And then I've been playing more Heroes of the Storm again because they suckered me into

34:03.200 --> 34:07.840
watching it on Twitch to get more of the loot chest drops, which in turn made me want to

34:07.840 --> 34:09.320
play Heroes of the Storm more.

34:09.320 --> 34:10.720
So that's that.

34:10.720 --> 34:13.740
Oh, and one more Overwatch.

34:13.740 --> 34:16.680
I actually checked out Overwatch for the first time this week in a long time because of all

34:16.680 --> 34:17.680
the Symmetra rework.

34:17.680 --> 34:20.160
They did a big Symmetra rework.

34:20.160 --> 34:23.600
They announced a new character on the PTR, which I know is coming up later in the show,

34:23.600 --> 34:27.000
which Overwatch fans already know, but we'll talk about that later.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.580
But I wanted to see the Symmetra reworking that they did.

34:29.580 --> 34:32.680
So obviously I wasn't going to get to play her in quick match because people are picking

34:32.680 --> 34:34.360
her like that to get to use her.

34:34.360 --> 34:36.560
But I got to play around in a little test zone.

34:36.560 --> 34:39.880
And then I went into a match as like Moira because I really love playing Moira.

34:39.880 --> 34:45.360
She's a great, like kind of fun, like heal and slight damage person.

34:45.360 --> 34:49.840
So yeah, I had a lot of fun playing her and I, I got, I did well enough that I got the

34:49.840 --> 34:53.160
little reputation thingies that are new.

34:53.160 --> 34:54.160
Is that what they're called?

34:54.160 --> 34:55.160
I don't know.

34:55.160 --> 35:01.220
They introduced, I think it's to try to counteract some of the toxicity in Overwatch is instead

35:01.220 --> 35:05.000
of making a negative mark thing, they try to do a positive thing where you can basically

35:05.000 --> 35:07.960
give like commendations to players who are really, really good.

35:07.960 --> 35:10.480
I think that's, I think that's what they call it.

35:10.480 --> 35:14.060
Maybe somebody in chat at live.vognetware.com knows what they really call it, but it's like

35:14.060 --> 35:17.780
extra recognition to, to do a well and beyond.

35:17.780 --> 35:18.780
And it goes on your profile.

35:18.780 --> 35:22.460
Like the more of these you get, the more of these commendations you get, the more you

35:22.460 --> 35:24.700
kind of level up on your profile, which is kind of cool.

35:24.700 --> 35:28.560
So people, people are trying to be nice to get those endorsements.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.560
Thank you.

35:29.560 --> 35:30.560
I knew like, I was like, what were they called?

35:30.560 --> 35:31.560
Yes.

35:31.560 --> 35:32.560
Endorsements.

35:32.560 --> 35:33.560
Thank you.

35:33.560 --> 35:34.560
No, I think that is right.

35:35.120 --> 35:36.120
This is my gaming week.

35:36.120 --> 35:37.120
I've talked plenty enough.

35:37.120 --> 35:40.800
So in this part of the show, I will remind you to check out our Twitter at twitter.com

35:40.800 --> 35:45.620
slash O L R. We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

35:45.620 --> 35:48.560
And that's all the housekeeping I have for you right now.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.540
We will be here over the next few weeks.

35:50.540 --> 35:55.620
There's no shows off planned until labor day because labor day weekend, I will be at dragon

35:55.620 --> 35:56.620
con.

35:56.620 --> 36:01.400
And if you are in the Southeast area or anywhere remotely near Atlanta, you should be making

36:01.400 --> 36:05.200
plans to attend dragon con as well, because it's a whole lot of fun.

36:05.200 --> 36:10.240
It looks very, very likely I will be doing some panels with the podcasting track.

36:10.240 --> 36:12.680
Very likely there may be more than that this year.

36:12.680 --> 36:16.520
So you'll just stay tuned, really excited at some of the prospects for this year's dragon

36:16.520 --> 36:17.520
con.

36:17.520 --> 36:18.520
So stay tuned for that.

36:18.520 --> 36:19.760
Bobby Black Wolf will be there too.

36:19.760 --> 36:21.320
He's doing a lot of stuff too.

36:21.320 --> 36:26.880
And from my understanding is because you guys know a good friend that was here on the last

36:26.880 --> 36:29.880
episode relocated to the East coast.

36:29.880 --> 36:33.320
So extra first now on the East coast, but he only is going to live like six hours from

36:33.320 --> 36:34.320
Atlanta.

36:34.320 --> 36:38.320
So extra for maybe a dragon con this year, I'm trying to try to get him to come.

36:38.320 --> 36:39.880
So we'll we'll see what happens.

36:39.880 --> 36:41.160
I think it'll be fun.

36:41.160 --> 36:44.160
So check that out anyway.

36:44.160 --> 36:49.280
Let's get into some gaming news and some other things that have happened this week, Loki.

36:49.280 --> 36:56.480
So you may remember that valve got rid of the API support for that was allowing steam

36:56.480 --> 36:58.620
spy to work.

36:58.620 --> 37:04.520
And mainly they had to kind of shut it off because of some of the GDPR European, I guess

37:04.520 --> 37:08.080
guidelines for data privacy enforcement.

37:08.080 --> 37:10.160
They had to stay in compliant with that.

37:10.160 --> 37:15.840
And because of that, that's why, you know, all the various profiles are private, so they

37:15.840 --> 37:17.720
can't really scrape that stuff.

37:17.720 --> 37:23.280
So now they're basically saying, you know, that they're going to come up with something

37:23.280 --> 37:24.640
to take its place.

37:24.640 --> 37:26.800
That's going to be better.

37:26.800 --> 37:30.880
Their quote, basically, our general approach has been to provide open API so that we don't

37:30.880 --> 37:37.800
offer the amount of tools that we are when we don't offer the amount of tools that we

37:37.800 --> 37:38.800
should.

37:38.800 --> 37:43.920
The community can step in, which allows things like steam spy to happen.

37:43.920 --> 37:48.860
However, that had a broad variance in how accurate it was.

37:48.860 --> 37:53.400
It was very accurate for some games and inaccurate for a few others.

37:53.400 --> 37:58.500
So they're hoping to fix the issue and create something that's better than steam spy to

37:58.500 --> 37:59.580
replace it.

37:59.580 --> 38:05.020
So yes, we're working on new tools and new ways to getting data out of steam.

38:05.020 --> 38:09.580
And we hope that data can be more accurate and more useful than what seems by previously

38:09.580 --> 38:11.000
offered.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.620
So that sounds like a good thing.

38:12.620 --> 38:17.220
And I guess we'll just wait and see when that happens because we're talking valve time here.

38:17.220 --> 38:21.340
So you know, we might count to three.

38:21.340 --> 38:26.980
We might be alive when that happens or we might not.

38:26.980 --> 38:27.980
Who knows?

38:27.980 --> 38:28.980
Do they even give a shit?

38:28.980 --> 38:34.880
Because I mean, after all, it's just, it's just selling games.

38:34.880 --> 38:39.060
I didn't really buy a whole lot on the steam sale or was that, that was recently wasn't

38:39.060 --> 38:40.060
it?

38:40.060 --> 38:41.060
It's still going.

38:41.060 --> 38:42.060
Yeah.

38:42.060 --> 38:46.920
You got, I, I've had, I had some strong words on steam past couple episodes.

38:46.920 --> 38:52.160
So I'm not really jumping at the bit to, to promote their sale, but I understand.

38:52.160 --> 38:56.680
And the reality is, you know, I'm, I bought a game that was very, very cheap.

38:56.680 --> 39:04.600
I had to buy it for 4.1 because it was only 20 bucks instead of like 50 what it normally

39:04.600 --> 39:05.600
is.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.960
But I can still be a frustrated customer.

39:07.960 --> 39:08.960
I haven't even looked at it.

39:08.960 --> 39:13.400
I should probably look, there's, yeah, there's a lot of stuff, but people can be pissed.

39:13.400 --> 39:15.360
So also can be pissed at me.

39:15.360 --> 39:17.680
Well, no, well, I'll say this too though.

39:17.680 --> 39:21.640
Keep in mind that usually when these types of sales happen, don't forget to check out

39:21.640 --> 39:25.520
GOG itch IO, the other humble bundle, the other stores too, because they tend to do

39:25.520 --> 39:28.360
response sales, especially around the 4th of July.

39:28.360 --> 39:32.600
So, you know, I will say that don't feel like you have to put all your eggs in one basket.

39:32.600 --> 39:33.600
Right.

39:33.600 --> 39:34.600
Yeah.

39:34.600 --> 39:35.600
So, all right.

39:35.600 --> 39:40.160
And I did, I did check the others first, but they were, you know, earth defense forces

39:40.160 --> 39:41.680
only on sale in the scene of store.

39:41.680 --> 39:42.680
So yeah, it happens.

39:43.360 --> 39:44.720
How to bite the bullet there.

39:44.720 --> 39:45.720
All right.

39:45.720 --> 39:48.760
Well, anyway, let's talk about Pokemon go again.

39:48.760 --> 39:49.760
Yeah.

39:49.760 --> 39:53.120
We won't talk about our weeks, but the reality is there's probably a lot of people talking

39:53.120 --> 39:54.840
about Pokemon go right now.

39:54.840 --> 39:55.840
Why?

39:55.840 --> 40:00.800
Because it apparently is at its highest player count since the beginning of the game.

40:00.800 --> 40:05.180
So obviously when the game first came out, like fucking everybody was playing it then

40:05.180 --> 40:09.320
as some of the server issues and you know, they took away the radars, you know, they

40:09.320 --> 40:12.580
were doing things that made some people kind of over it.

40:12.580 --> 40:15.500
So it dropped way off, but it was far from dead.

40:15.500 --> 40:19.140
It was never a dead game, despite what some sensationalist clickbait headlines would make

40:19.140 --> 40:20.140
you believe.

40:20.140 --> 40:25.020
And the reality is it's back from the dead, uh, this week it's doing very well.

40:25.020 --> 40:27.220
This is based on a study from super data.

40:27.220 --> 40:30.880
Apparently the game generated $104 million in may.

40:30.880 --> 40:35.940
I don't know how they, they measure this, but I guess they can see some of the, uh,

40:35.940 --> 40:38.180
the rankings and the different stores and stuff.

40:38.180 --> 40:40.140
They kind of figure it out that way.

40:40.140 --> 40:44.380
Um, the long awaited trading feature as well as friend feature.

40:44.380 --> 40:46.720
This is being credited for that whole thing.

40:46.720 --> 40:49.020
So, um, have you done any trading in?

40:49.020 --> 40:50.020
I haven't.

40:50.020 --> 40:54.100
No, I should, I should trade you a Pokemon cause if I trade you a Pokemon that I got

40:54.100 --> 40:58.660
in Chicago, uh, you'll instantly get your bronze trading metal cause it's over a thousand

40:58.660 --> 40:59.660
kilometers.

40:59.660 --> 41:00.660
Oh yeah.

41:00.660 --> 41:01.660
Kind of fun.

41:01.660 --> 41:02.880
And I can trade you one too, Jamie, if you want.

41:02.880 --> 41:08.340
So anyway, um, the also, uh, a lot of people coming back to Pokemon go because they're

41:08.340 --> 41:10.700
getting ready for let's go Pikachu and Eevee.

41:10.700 --> 41:12.740
I know there were some people that were coming back for that.

41:12.740 --> 41:15.720
Uh, so yeah, the game is doing quite well.

41:15.720 --> 41:19.540
So if you call it a dead game right now, you don't know what you're talking about.

41:19.540 --> 41:20.540
Clearly.

41:20.540 --> 41:23.500
Um, so I mean, props to them for bringing people back.

41:23.500 --> 41:25.900
How long will it stay that high?

41:25.900 --> 41:26.900
We'll see.

41:26.900 --> 41:30.760
I think it'll probably taper off pretty quick again, but they've done a pretty good job

41:30.760 --> 41:34.340
about doing these little things to kind of get people that are curious to pop on back

41:34.340 --> 41:35.340
and check it out.

41:35.340 --> 41:36.340
That's for sure.

41:36.340 --> 41:38.100
So, uh, check that out.

41:38.100 --> 41:39.100
Moving on.

41:39.100 --> 41:40.100
Dark Sakura.

41:40.100 --> 41:41.100
What do you have for us?

41:41.100 --> 41:45.140
Uh, just finding out the Dragon Ball Fighter Z for the ultimate edition of 70 bucks on

41:45.140 --> 41:46.140
steam right now.

41:46.140 --> 41:52.820
No, but other than that, um, Google is, uh, doing shenanigans.

41:52.820 --> 41:58.460
They're basically, well, at least the sources indicate that they are planning a gaming platform

41:58.460 --> 42:03.100
to take on Microsoft, to take on Sony, to take on Nintendo.

42:03.100 --> 42:06.220
Um, they want it to be a streaming platform.

42:06.220 --> 42:10.600
They're creating hardware for it, and they're already working on bringing in developers

42:10.600 --> 42:15.540
under Google, so, uh, they've been putting in some major recruiting and trying to acquire

42:15.540 --> 42:18.180
their company, too.

42:18.180 --> 42:19.180
Other companies.

42:19.180 --> 42:25.740
Um, and basically the people who have been talking about this, um, have either been involved

42:25.740 --> 42:29.060
in the issue or know people who have been involved in the issue.

42:29.060 --> 42:34.980
Um, I mean, and they did try to acquire Twitch before Amazon stepped in, so we had that there.

42:34.980 --> 42:37.260
So they've been thinking about this for a while.

42:37.260 --> 42:38.260
Um.

42:38.260 --> 42:39.840
Thank God that didn't happen.

42:39.840 --> 42:44.420
The rumor was going on for a while that they wanted to do something based on Android, but

42:44.420 --> 42:46.760
that didn't happen either.

42:46.760 --> 42:50.100
So they're, they're trying to push through other things.

42:50.100 --> 42:54.380
I mean, it's all been rumors before, but this one seems to be, have a lot more weight to

42:54.380 --> 42:55.380
it.

42:55.380 --> 42:56.380
So, we'll see.

42:56.380 --> 43:00.900
How about you support your fucking platforms you already have, like my Android TV that

43:00.900 --> 43:03.060
hardly has any fucking apps on it.

43:03.060 --> 43:04.060
How about that shit?

43:04.140 --> 43:09.100
Yeah, I can't help, but when I hear like Google gaming, my mind instantly goes to an Android

43:09.100 --> 43:12.140
console and I go like, oh, so they're going to make an Ouya.

43:12.140 --> 43:14.580
No, it's not going to be an Ouya.

43:14.580 --> 43:17.020
I mean, I, I don't know.

43:17.020 --> 43:20.500
So the streaming platform right now is code named Yeti.

43:20.500 --> 43:24.700
Um, so we'll see if there's an accuracy to it.

43:24.700 --> 43:26.620
Yeah, I'm not going to knock it till I've tried it.

43:26.620 --> 43:28.300
You know, let's, let's see what games.

43:28.300 --> 43:29.300
Right.

43:29.300 --> 43:30.300
Right.

43:30.300 --> 43:31.380
Dark Sakura, golden rule of OLR.

43:31.380 --> 43:34.300
It's been a while, it's been a while since we've reminded the listeners about the golden

43:34.300 --> 43:35.300
rule of gaming.

43:35.300 --> 43:38.940
Dark Sakura, would you please, uh, educate the listeners of OLR what the golden rule

43:38.940 --> 43:39.940
of gaming is?

43:39.940 --> 43:41.740
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

43:41.740 --> 43:42.740
That is correct.

43:42.740 --> 43:43.740
With caveat.

43:43.740 --> 43:51.740
It also depends on how well those games play because after having played the same game

43:51.740 --> 43:56.100
on multiple consoles, some, some consoles will do it better.

43:56.100 --> 43:57.100
Okay.

43:57.100 --> 43:58.100
Fair enough.

43:58.100 --> 44:02.220
In other words, PC is all you need because PC is going to do it lately.

44:02.220 --> 44:04.260
It depends on your setup though.

44:04.260 --> 44:09.420
PCs, gaming on PC is expensive and I don't want to get into the console versus PC debate.

44:09.420 --> 44:11.140
I'm just being playful.

44:11.140 --> 44:14.060
Uh, you got to do what works for you at the end of the day.

44:14.060 --> 44:18.220
So well, and I came to this conclusion actually watching one of my favorite YouTube channels,

44:18.220 --> 44:20.220
battle of the ports.

44:20.220 --> 44:25.660
They talk about games that just look stellar on some consoles and play like shit.

44:25.700 --> 44:28.380
So again, take all that into account.

44:28.380 --> 44:29.380
Yep.

44:29.380 --> 44:32.540
Especially with so much being multi-console in this day and age.

44:32.540 --> 44:33.540
That's for sure.

44:33.540 --> 44:34.540
Exactly.

44:34.540 --> 44:35.540
Exactly.

44:35.540 --> 44:36.540
All righty.

44:36.540 --> 44:37.540
Uh, let's move on.

44:37.540 --> 44:38.540
Loki, what do you have for us?

44:38.540 --> 44:42.580
So here's something kind of fun and something we've been asking for for a while.

44:42.580 --> 44:47.900
It's like, why these consoles, these modern consoles have USB ports in them.

44:47.900 --> 44:50.220
Why don't they support mouse and keyboard?

44:50.220 --> 44:51.220
Huh?

44:51.220 --> 44:52.500
Why don't they?

44:52.500 --> 44:53.500
No idea.

44:53.500 --> 44:58.420
The controller does if the game does it because you can play a Final Fantasy 14 with keyboard

44:58.420 --> 44:59.420
and mouse.

44:59.420 --> 45:00.420
I do it.

45:00.420 --> 45:02.500
Well, that's nice, but I'm talking about like other games.

45:02.500 --> 45:03.500
I know.

45:03.500 --> 45:04.500
I know.

45:04.500 --> 45:08.260
I, but, but I'm just saying the system can support it, but for whatever reason, a lot

45:08.260 --> 45:13.140
of games like Overwatch won't allow it because Blizzard views that as like tipping the balance

45:13.140 --> 45:16.220
or I don't know what the fuck their problem is, but that's, you know, they don't, they,

45:16.220 --> 45:20.500
they see that as an advantage over people playing on controller, I guess it's separated

45:20.500 --> 45:21.500
out.

45:21.500 --> 45:22.500
I don't know.

45:22.500 --> 45:27.380
Um, but anyways, Microsoft is actually been working with razor to bring full mouse and

45:27.380 --> 45:30.100
keyboard support to the Xbox one.

45:30.100 --> 45:36.680
Apparently there's been some leaked documents about a presentation where they've been creating

45:36.680 --> 45:42.980
some different, uh, devices to work with the Xbox one citing, they said that the turret

45:42.980 --> 45:51.420
and black widow devices and, um, even with chroma light up keys and whatnot, funny enough,

45:51.420 --> 45:57.820
I actually just got gaming, uh, a gaming PC and, or not PC, but a keyboard and mouse.

45:57.820 --> 46:03.060
Cause now we have, uh, I set up like a home office thing for my laptop.

46:03.060 --> 46:07.060
So I have a, you know, game of mouse and keyboard now with a, I got a Corsair keyboard and a

46:07.060 --> 46:08.500
razor mouse.

46:08.500 --> 46:14.000
So now I can try to do some mousey keyboard like everybody else and instead of using controller,

46:14.000 --> 46:15.700
it's unnatural for me though.

46:15.700 --> 46:19.740
So I don't like it, but I'll try it.

46:19.740 --> 46:22.500
Um, interesting though.

46:22.500 --> 46:25.740
It doesn't say any other details like when we might expect this.

46:25.740 --> 46:31.740
Um, but I know they said basically, no Minecraft bedrock edition currently supports mouse and

46:31.740 --> 46:36.860
keyboard and that's, you know, on all these platforms.

46:36.860 --> 46:39.380
So I guess we'll have to wait and see.

46:39.380 --> 46:42.360
I would be very curious how many of you are interested in something like this.

46:42.360 --> 46:47.680
I always kind of thought when people want to use mouse and keyboard, they just go to,

46:47.680 --> 46:49.200
you know, their computer.

46:49.200 --> 46:53.280
You know, Xbox three 60 also cause final fantasy 11 also used keyboard, right?

46:53.280 --> 46:54.280
Keyboard.

46:54.280 --> 46:55.520
I don't know about mouse, but use keyboard.

46:55.520 --> 46:58.120
So anyway, I mean, I don't know.

46:58.120 --> 47:02.120
Like for more of these like MMO type games, maybe, uh, maybe if you really want to get

47:02.120 --> 47:06.280
competitive like Overwatch or something like that and all you have as a console, you can't

47:06.280 --> 47:11.280
afford, you know, to buy an expensive PC or something, maybe at least you can drop money

47:11.280 --> 47:15.800
for a keyboard mouse and try to play better that way.

47:15.800 --> 47:16.800
I don't know.

47:16.800 --> 47:17.800
All right.

47:17.800 --> 47:19.640
Let's talk about sexy band games.

47:19.640 --> 47:20.640
Yay.

47:20.640 --> 47:21.960
I love sexy band game.

47:21.960 --> 47:22.960
All right.

47:22.960 --> 47:24.800
So what is the latest sexy band game?

47:24.800 --> 47:27.800
It's a game called Omega Labyrinth Z.

47:27.800 --> 47:31.640
It was a game that was released for the PlayStation four and the PlayStation Vita.

47:31.640 --> 47:34.400
So you know, I'm talking about Japan cause it was Vita supported.

47:34.400 --> 47:35.600
Uh, this was a game.

47:35.600 --> 47:38.360
It's a dungeon crawler, I guess.

47:38.360 --> 47:42.040
But I mean when you look at like the graphics and stuff, it doesn't look like a dungeon

47:42.040 --> 47:43.040
crawler.

47:43.040 --> 47:45.720
That is official dungeon crawling garb.

47:45.720 --> 47:53.480
I am sorry, but this, this school girls like F cup boobies are like, they're not just sticking

47:53.480 --> 47:54.480
out.

47:54.480 --> 47:56.840
They're sticking out and like going around her jacket.

47:56.840 --> 47:58.460
That's not an F cup, Rob.

47:58.460 --> 48:00.120
As one, I can tell you that's not an F cup.

48:00.120 --> 48:01.120
Oh my God.

48:01.120 --> 48:02.840
So what cup would that be?

48:02.840 --> 48:05.400
That would be more like a double Z.

48:05.400 --> 48:08.040
No, they actually do make double G.

48:08.040 --> 48:10.000
It's, it's, it's H for hentai.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
Okay.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.560
It's H it's an H cup.

48:12.560 --> 48:13.560
H for hentai.

48:13.560 --> 48:14.560
I like that.

48:14.560 --> 48:15.560
All right.

48:15.560 --> 48:16.560
Anyway.

48:16.560 --> 48:20.040
Uh, so apparently the localization of this game has been refused by Sony, uh, for North

48:20.040 --> 48:21.560
America and Europe.

48:21.560 --> 48:24.160
The game was being localized by P cube.

48:24.160 --> 48:25.680
It's a UK based publisher.

48:25.680 --> 48:28.200
Uh, and then I guess the localization has been announced.

48:28.200 --> 48:29.200
It's been canceled.

48:29.200 --> 48:33.280
Uh, and they put in a little statement over on Twitter.

48:33.280 --> 48:38.360
Uh, basically they try to do Japanese content for its fans as close to the source material

48:38.360 --> 48:39.360
as possible.

48:39.360 --> 48:44.440
Uh, P cube try to work with the relevant age rating, uh, bodies and their respective territories,

48:44.440 --> 48:47.320
and they have to comply with the wishes of the platform holder.

48:47.320 --> 48:48.460
And so they just withdrew it.

48:48.460 --> 48:55.360
So basically the game was too, too slutty with people that are too young, uh, to be

48:55.360 --> 48:56.360
released.

48:56.360 --> 49:00.240
Well, I mean, they could have changed the age to everyone.

49:00.240 --> 49:08.120
That sucks that these platforms are just, you know, have no region code, all region

49:08.120 --> 49:09.120
free anyway.

49:09.120 --> 49:10.120
I dunno.

49:10.120 --> 49:15.800
Anyway, I guess also, uh, the Britain video standards council refused a box release for

49:15.800 --> 49:21.480
the game in the UK back in March because the player touches certain points on a female

49:21.480 --> 49:24.400
character's body to arouse them.

49:24.400 --> 49:31.560
A successful action will activate a shame break where parts of their clothing come off,

49:31.560 --> 49:33.160
revealing more of their bodies.

49:33.160 --> 49:35.280
Do they have shit like this on the 3DS?

49:35.280 --> 49:37.040
I don't understand what the problem is.

49:37.040 --> 49:43.500
The player places honey on the girl's bodies, a fantastical dog-like creature that proceeds

49:43.500 --> 49:48.680
to lick the honey off of their bodies, which causes them to become aroused.

49:48.680 --> 49:49.680
I'm laughing.

49:49.680 --> 49:51.400
This is so fucking stupid.

49:51.400 --> 49:55.900
Like the previous mini game, when they reach a certain level of arousal, parts of their

49:55.900 --> 49:58.580
clothing fall off or vanish.

49:58.580 --> 50:03.880
As the dog licks at the honey, the girls respond with sexualized language.

50:03.880 --> 50:08.740
But of course the main problem is that it takes place in a high school.

50:08.740 --> 50:14.080
And so that means the characters are probably not quite 18 or barely so.

50:14.080 --> 50:17.720
So where is the labyrinth in like the dungeon crawling with this?

50:17.720 --> 50:22.760
Because so far I'm hearing like there's a dog that's licking a girl.

50:22.760 --> 50:26.680
I mean, where's the dungeon crawling here?

50:26.680 --> 50:30.240
By the way, in some of the screenshots, we see one female character saying to another,

50:30.240 --> 50:34.320
you there, your skirt is too short, fix it right now.

50:34.320 --> 50:38.520
And another one, a little fairy type creature is saying, eh, well, you have to stroke it

50:38.520 --> 50:40.920
between your breasts.

50:40.920 --> 50:43.680
Jamie, would you play this game?

50:43.680 --> 50:44.680
Maybe.

50:44.680 --> 50:55.960
I just, I think that's ridiculous.

50:55.960 --> 51:01.360
It's God forbid that God forbid we represent, you know, women getting aroused by something,

51:01.360 --> 51:05.340
but let's just blow some fucking brains and have, have intestines falling out.

51:05.340 --> 51:06.340
That's okay.

51:06.340 --> 51:07.340
Here's the thing.

51:07.340 --> 51:08.340
Here's the thing.

51:08.340 --> 51:09.340
I get the age concern.

51:09.340 --> 51:10.340
I don't want to invalidate that.

51:10.340 --> 51:13.840
It is fucking creepy when it's high school kids at 16, 17.

51:14.480 --> 51:20.840
If upon localization of the game, maybe they could be it's college and they're 20 years

51:20.840 --> 51:25.960
old, you know, it's a little bit like less creepy than maybe, you know, this, some of

51:25.960 --> 51:28.000
these concerns would probably be eased up a little bit.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
I don't know.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
It's also a cartoon.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
They're not alive.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
They don't have ages anyway.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
I don't know.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.600
It's more of the connotation of it.

51:36.600 --> 51:40.200
Yeah, perhaps, perhaps blow those brains away.

51:40.200 --> 51:41.200
That's fine.

51:41.700 --> 51:47.640
It is ridiculous that people are far more concerned about violence than they are about,

51:47.640 --> 51:57.040
um, I'm sorry, far less concerned about violence than they are about, um, sex or language or

51:57.040 --> 51:58.440
it's, people are fucking stupid.

51:58.440 --> 52:04.380
But if you want to play a game that oozes sexuality and femininity and is about adults,

52:04.380 --> 52:06.020
play Bayonetta.

52:06.020 --> 52:10.260
That's why I fucking love Bayonetta because there is room for excessiveness and over the

52:10.260 --> 52:11.780
topness in video gaming.

52:11.780 --> 52:19.420
Not everything has to be, you know, like a legit story, you know, like a Pulitzer Prize

52:19.420 --> 52:20.980
writing script thing.

52:20.980 --> 52:26.620
Like for in every movie, movie theater and every movie house and things, there's going

52:26.620 --> 52:29.180
to be campy films.

52:29.180 --> 52:31.300
There's going to be John Waters movies.

52:31.300 --> 52:35.620
There's going to be the types of movies that Elvira watches and mystery science theater

52:35.620 --> 52:37.360
3000 makes fun of.

52:37.360 --> 52:39.180
There's a place in art for that type of stuff.

52:39.180 --> 52:40.940
And that's where Bayonetta kind of fits for me.

52:40.940 --> 52:45.300
Maybe we can get John Waters a telltale series.

52:45.300 --> 52:48.580
Why hasn't John Waters a telltale game?

52:48.580 --> 52:50.820
Pink Flamingos, the live adventure.

52:50.820 --> 52:51.820
All right.

52:51.820 --> 52:56.100
Anyway, they should just do a game called the quest for eggs.

52:56.100 --> 53:01.620
Uh, over in our chat, over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, Bobby Black Wolf says, my wife walked

53:01.620 --> 53:07.820
in right when you were describing this, she's wondering what I'm actually listening to.

53:07.820 --> 53:08.820
Come on.

53:08.820 --> 53:09.820
This isn't that stream.

53:09.820 --> 53:10.820
My bad.

53:10.820 --> 53:11.820
Sorry about that for us.

53:11.820 --> 53:16.820
I mean, she couldn't tell my insanely nasally over the top voice describing this.

53:16.820 --> 53:18.820
She couldn't tell it was me.

53:18.820 --> 53:23.940
Uh, anyway, uh, dungeon buster says this sounds like a trash game, but to each their own,

53:23.940 --> 53:25.820
here's the thing though.

53:25.820 --> 53:32.460
Sometimes you want trash, like, can you explain to me why Taco Bell stays in business?

53:32.460 --> 53:35.860
Because news flash, the food ain't good.

53:35.860 --> 53:38.140
But sometimes you're craving trash.

53:38.140 --> 53:39.140
No, no, no.

53:39.140 --> 53:42.560
You're not craving Mexican food because Taco Bell is not Mexican food.

53:42.560 --> 53:46.340
You're craving trash, right?

53:46.340 --> 53:49.980
I had some friends that went to Waffle House for the first time today.

53:49.980 --> 53:51.780
I fucking love Waffle House and it's not trash.

53:51.780 --> 53:56.620
Shout out to Extifer and Shane who are on their adventure today.

53:56.620 --> 53:58.660
Sometimes you're craving trashy diner food.

53:58.660 --> 54:00.860
Waffle House is not trashy food.

54:00.860 --> 54:01.860
It's delicious.

54:01.860 --> 54:02.860
It's hangover food.

54:02.860 --> 54:03.860
It is not.

54:03.860 --> 54:04.860
I don't know.

54:04.860 --> 54:05.860
I want unlimited waffle right now.

54:05.860 --> 54:09.500
But you always have to order them well done because they do make their waffles a little

54:09.500 --> 54:10.500
soggy.

54:10.500 --> 54:11.500
All right.

54:11.500 --> 54:15.060
Uh, and that's the 100 Matt and Chad says, wake me when a sleep away camp game comes

54:15.060 --> 54:16.060
out.

54:16.060 --> 54:17.060
Seriously.

54:17.060 --> 54:20.420
Like if they had a place that would offer, you know how like I have offers like unlimited

54:20.420 --> 54:21.420
pancakes.

54:21.420 --> 54:22.420
I want unlimited waffles.

54:22.420 --> 54:25.140
We're going to get unlimited waffles.

54:25.140 --> 54:29.100
I how was I hob now?

54:29.100 --> 54:31.460
No, it's, it's, I hob.

54:31.460 --> 54:33.700
No one goes to your stupid restaurant for burgers.

54:33.700 --> 54:35.620
Your burgers tastes like shit.

54:35.620 --> 54:36.860
No one ever goes there.

54:36.860 --> 54:39.500
Isn't that whole thing just a marketing stunt to get people to talk about it?

54:39.500 --> 54:41.560
Like they're not actually changing their name.

54:41.560 --> 54:44.940
I understand that, but like, I think it was a whole stunt to bring out the sassiness of

54:44.940 --> 54:45.940
Wendy's.

54:45.940 --> 54:48.460
But it's like, it's like, Hey, we make pancakes.

54:48.460 --> 54:50.540
We make some fucking bomb ass pancakes.

54:50.540 --> 54:54.340
Let's focus on these shitty ass fucking hamburgers that we make.

54:54.340 --> 54:56.940
Why would you do that?

54:56.940 --> 55:00.100
Why did you focus on the breakfast food?

55:00.100 --> 55:01.100
It's good.

55:01.100 --> 55:03.460
Your hamburgers not so much.

55:03.460 --> 55:10.580
Because the problem is most of the I hops in America die between the hours of 1 PM and

55:10.580 --> 55:16.260
midnight because, well, I mean, once the bars are let out, then they start filling up again.

55:16.260 --> 55:17.340
Cause people are like, Oh, I'm drunk.

55:17.340 --> 55:18.340
I want pancakes.

55:18.340 --> 55:22.420
If I'm going during dinner time, I'm getting fucking pancakes because it's an I hop.

55:22.420 --> 55:23.980
I'm not going there for fucking hamburgers.

55:23.980 --> 55:28.740
If I want a hammer, I'll go to a million other places that are better than them, including

55:28.740 --> 55:30.140
McDonald's and McDonald's.

55:30.140 --> 55:32.460
Isn't even the food.

55:32.460 --> 55:34.740
Speaking of sometimes you crave trash.

55:34.740 --> 55:38.220
I never, I, do you know what they put in chicken nuggets?

55:38.220 --> 55:39.220
Trash.

55:39.220 --> 55:41.420
They're so fucking delicious.

55:41.420 --> 55:44.760
I know, but it is just as I thought trash.

55:44.760 --> 55:49.620
Their hamburgers though are not so great, but they are better than the I hops hamburgers.

55:49.620 --> 55:54.460
Hey, when you're dead broke, you know, dollar hamburger works.

55:54.460 --> 55:58.820
Tiger claw on chat says, do you know anyone that eats pancakes for lunch or dinner?

55:58.820 --> 56:01.660
Um, yeah, I'm raising my hand.

56:02.260 --> 56:03.260
I'm raising them both.

56:03.260 --> 56:05.340
Breakfast for dinner is bomb.

56:05.340 --> 56:06.340
Like yeah, it is.

56:06.340 --> 56:10.420
I mean, you know what, O L R official challenge.

56:10.420 --> 56:14.660
I want everyone, including the hosts, I want everyone this week, once this week to have

56:14.660 --> 56:18.460
breakfast for dinner and send us your snaps at O L R over on Twitter.

56:18.460 --> 56:20.140
I do this shit without a challenge.

56:20.140 --> 56:22.620
I make, I make scram.

56:22.620 --> 56:24.500
I make omurice at night.

56:24.500 --> 56:26.200
You know what omurice is, right?

56:26.200 --> 56:27.500
It's the omelet over rice.

56:27.500 --> 56:30.780
I don't make it with ketchup cause ketchup is disgusting.

56:30.780 --> 56:32.860
But I make omurice like regularly.

56:32.860 --> 56:34.300
You don't, you don't have to go to I hop.

56:34.300 --> 56:35.520
This is not a commercial for I hop.

56:35.520 --> 56:37.500
You can, you can make your own damn pancakes.

56:37.500 --> 56:41.580
Get out the bisque quick and make your own damn pancakes and fucking bisque quick.

56:41.580 --> 56:48.020
I have the Birch benders pancake mix, which is delicious and craisins because it goes

56:48.020 --> 56:50.720
amazing in their pancakes and chocolate chips.

56:50.720 --> 56:53.300
And if you want to waffle, have a waffle.

56:53.300 --> 56:54.300
Make that waffle bitch.

56:54.300 --> 56:57.060
We got rid of our waffle irons.

56:57.060 --> 56:58.060
I need a waffle iron.

56:58.060 --> 56:59.060
Oh my God.

56:59.060 --> 57:02.140
Why would you get rid of waffle irons and not give it to me?

57:02.140 --> 57:03.300
My wife didn't like them.

57:03.300 --> 57:05.180
Do you want to borrow our Hello Kitty waffle maker?

57:05.180 --> 57:06.180
No, it's, it's cool.

57:06.180 --> 57:08.260
I don't need the waffles like that.

57:08.260 --> 57:13.260
I mean, I might be able to make it work if I put it in cause you know I have a Hello

57:13.260 --> 57:14.260
Kitty.

57:14.260 --> 57:15.940
I have like one of those, like it's not a George form.

57:15.940 --> 57:16.940
It's a panini press.

57:16.940 --> 57:21.420
Maybe if I put enough batter in there, that might make a weird looking like crinkle cup

57:21.420 --> 57:22.420
waffle or something.

57:22.420 --> 57:27.320
Well, actually the Foreman grills have a waffle tray.

57:27.320 --> 57:28.820
That's how Alan makes waffles.

57:29.580 --> 57:30.580
The nicer ones.

57:30.580 --> 57:31.580
Yeah.

57:31.580 --> 57:32.580
Yeah.

57:32.580 --> 57:33.580
Oh, well we have a nice Foreman grills.

57:33.580 --> 57:34.580
Rob, can I borrow your waffle maker?

57:34.580 --> 57:35.580
Yeah.

57:35.580 --> 57:37.300
Cause I think my pancake batter works for waffles.

57:37.300 --> 57:38.300
Oh yeah.

57:38.300 --> 57:39.300
Work.

57:39.300 --> 57:40.300
Cool.

57:40.300 --> 57:41.300
All right.

57:41.300 --> 57:42.820
And my work, to be honest though, my work on our cafe, we have self-serve waffles.

57:42.820 --> 57:46.180
I wonder if I can make like, put my protein powder in it, make protein waffles.

57:46.180 --> 57:49.620
Speaking of breakfast, let's talk about eggs, dark Sakura.

57:49.620 --> 57:50.620
Eggman.

57:50.620 --> 57:53.780
Eggs, eggs, it's the Eggman.

57:53.780 --> 57:55.100
I love my eggs.

57:55.100 --> 57:57.700
I love the Eggman.

57:57.700 --> 58:01.340
The sad thing is there's probably like two OLR listeners that will understand that reference

58:01.340 --> 58:03.220
whatsoever.

58:03.220 --> 58:04.220
You know, I know that reference.

58:04.220 --> 58:06.220
I've never seen the movie all the way through.

58:06.220 --> 58:10.740
It's a Pink Flamingos reference for those who don't know, which I just, I feel the need.

58:10.740 --> 58:11.740
Isn't it Edith?

58:11.740 --> 58:15.380
Yeah, it's Edith Massey's character that she's like this old lady that sits in a crib the

58:15.380 --> 58:16.380
whole movie.

58:16.380 --> 58:17.380
And she loves eggs.

58:17.380 --> 58:18.380
Yeah.

58:18.380 --> 58:19.380
She loves the Eggman.

58:19.380 --> 58:20.380
She gets excited when she visits.

58:20.380 --> 58:21.780
See, you guys just don't understand.

58:21.780 --> 58:22.780
You don't understand.

58:22.780 --> 58:23.780
You do need the watch.

58:23.780 --> 58:26.460
So seriously though, if you, they did this wonderful thing.

58:26.460 --> 58:30.460
I watch a lot of this channel, Red Letter Media.

58:30.460 --> 58:37.280
They did a retrospective on Pink Flamingos and they really do go break down all the details

58:37.280 --> 58:38.280
of the movie.

58:38.280 --> 58:39.280
So you got to totally watch it because it's awesome.

58:39.280 --> 58:41.780
So it's like Game Theory, but for Pink Flamingos.

58:41.780 --> 58:46.060
More like Gaming Historian than like for Pink Flamingos.

58:46.060 --> 58:49.540
But they're filmmakers, so they go into like different techniques and they even go like,

58:49.540 --> 58:50.540
what techniques?

58:50.540 --> 58:53.180
Well, they talk about like how they feel different.

58:53.180 --> 58:54.180
What techniques?

58:54.900 --> 58:55.900
I don't know.

58:55.900 --> 58:59.900
John Waters movies do have some very interesting film techniques, especially for the lower

58:59.900 --> 59:00.900
budget stuff.

59:00.900 --> 59:04.900
Cause you have to, when you have no budget like that, but then again, you want to see

59:04.900 --> 59:08.260
some interesting cinematography, fucking watch Cry Baby.

59:08.260 --> 59:11.220
MXC in chat says, Edith Massey for life.

59:11.220 --> 59:13.100
I love her in Desperate Living.

59:13.100 --> 59:14.100
Okay.

59:14.100 --> 59:17.920
You got points for me for referencing Desperate Living because I mean, you have a hard enough

59:17.920 --> 59:22.060
time finding people who've actually seen Pink Flamingos, then try to see who's seen Desperate

59:22.060 --> 59:25.940
Living because that was like the one John Waters movie that Divine wasn't in.

59:25.940 --> 59:29.180
And so it's like even less people have seen that somehow, but that movie is incredible.

59:29.180 --> 59:30.180
Anyway.

59:30.180 --> 59:31.180
I fucking love Divine.

59:31.180 --> 59:32.180
Anyway.

59:32.180 --> 59:33.180
Sorry.

59:33.180 --> 59:34.180
Eggs.

59:34.180 --> 59:35.180
Okay.

59:35.180 --> 59:37.580
So, and I'm sure everyone knows this cause I've seen it all the fuck over Facebook, but

59:37.580 --> 59:39.620
I figured it had to be mentioned.

59:39.620 --> 59:48.660
Jim Carrey has been in negotiations with Paramount to play Eggman as in Dr Robotnik from Sonic

59:48.660 --> 59:49.740
the Hedgehog.

59:49.740 --> 59:54.700
And yes, the Sonic the Hedgehog movie is going to be a combination of live action CG.

59:54.700 --> 59:58.500
It sounds like a fucking train wreck, but we'll see.

59:58.500 --> 01:00:06.300
It has James Marsden in it and Tika Sumpter being directed by Jeff Fowler.

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:07.460
We'll fucking see.

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:11.220
I mean, I guess he could play a pretty good Eggman.

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:16.020
I kind of see him being able to just given the range of comedic roles that he's played

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:20.260
and he would definitely play a funny kind of evil.

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:28.780
So it makes sense to me, but at the same time, I'm just still kind of like, I'm down.

01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:32.340
I'm down for any train wreck starring Jim Carrey.

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:33.340
You're a big Jim Carrey fan.

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:34.420
I am a big Jim Carrey fan.

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:35.560
I'll watch anything that he's in.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.540
That's where Loki comes from.

01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:41.900
Sometimes people think it's the Marvel character, but you actually got your name for the mask.

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:42.900
Yeah.

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:44.900
So it's kind of funny.

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:53.380
I was thinking Norse God, you know, before not referencing Marvel, but nope, Jim Carrey.

01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:54.380
Anyway.

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:56.260
No, I'll check it out.

01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:57.260
Why not?

01:00:57.260 --> 01:01:01.020
I I'm with some of the chatters that are like, let's see a trailer.

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.820
Let's let's let's see some footage before we come to a conclusion on that.

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:05.820
Yeah.

01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:07.300
I don't know how I feel.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:11.820
I want to know where they're going to get the Mario and Luigi voices from for the Mario

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:16.700
Brothers movie that they're doing over on the others that the people that did Despicable

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:19.180
Me are doing that that Mario movie, right?

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:23.020
Because that's why we're getting Mario Land at Universal Studios are going to do a movie

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:24.020
as well.

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:25.020
So I'm kind of curious.

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:26.020
We'll see.

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:27.020
We'll see.

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:30.060
Actually, speaking of Mario movies, have you ever seen the anime that came out in the 80s

01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:32.540
where Luigi has like the blue and yellow outfit?

01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:33.540
I don't think I have.

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:36.300
The whole fucking thing is on YouTube and it's bad.

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:38.380
It is not good, but it's hilarious.

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:40.860
Yeah, I'm good with hilariously bad.

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:41.900
All right.

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:45.660
Just a few more stories before we get into the hilariously awesome classic peripheral

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:46.660
of the month.

01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:47.660
Loki.

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:48.660
Yes.

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:52.820
So my kids are bugging me again today when we went to the GameStop to look at what we

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:57.100
just killed time before we went grocery shopping, but they wanted to buy Labo stuff.

01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:00.300
And I said, no, because it's 80 dollars and fuck that shit.

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:01.620
And they said and they're like, why?

01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:05.340
I'm like, well, you're going to break it and it's going to be all over the house and that's

01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:06.660
why you can't have it.

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:08.660
But this is something interesting, though.

01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:14.660
So if you like arcade games, you can get your own arcade cabinet that's cardboard for the

01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:15.660
Nintendo Switch.

01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:17.300
It's only 20 bucks.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:21.640
It's coming out November 27th, coming out from a Nyko.

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.940
And it's this cute little cabinet that you can put your joy cons in.

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:32.260
They even have little like joystick add ons for your analog sticks.

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:35.740
And yeah, it looks like you can customize it.

01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:37.580
They have sticker sheets with pixels on them.

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:43.780
They can make pixel art. It's 20 dollars way better than 80 dollars.

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:45.260
So that's good.

01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:48.620
I like that they're kind of branching out and doing more stuff with Labo.

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:52.140
Yeah, definitely. Well, I mean, yeah, absolutely.

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:53.640
So and this is kind of neat, too.

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:56.300
Now, this is something else for like arcade fans, too.

01:02:56.300 --> 01:03:01.580
You may remember that they're getting a lot of different games that have vertical screen

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:07.560
support. So like Ikaruga, for example, the arcade archives Donkey Kong.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:12.360
Was another thing. So now there's this Kickstarter for an accessory for the switch called the

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:19.960
Flip Grip, and the Flip Grip allows you to actually put the screen in a vertical orientation

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:22.920
and be able to snap the joy cons in there as well.

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:27.840
So you can play vertical games without having to balance the screen really funky in order

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:29.640
to actually make that happen.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.640
So that's pretty cool.

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:38.000
Basically, it says right now the let's see what they've got left on it.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.720
So they had quite a bit to go in the campaign.

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:46.760
And I think I think you didn't have the pledge too much to actually get one of these.

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:51.120
So there's still no, actually, they've hit their goal.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.800
So they had seven days to go right now.

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:56.920
There are one hundred and nine thousand of forty two thousand dollars, so they've made it

01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.680
there. If you want one of these flip grips, you can pay twelve bucks.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:06.920
And they're estimated they're going to deliver those on sometime in 2018.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.600
Looks like November. So neat.

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:16.280
All right, well, if all that expansion in the Labo universe and associated universe wasn't

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:17.480
enough, guess what?

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:22.320
Now, Nintendo Labo products can be used with actual switch games.

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:27.760
Yeah, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was patched this week to be compatible with Nintendo Labo.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:34.080
So you can actually use the little like motorcycle type of little thing that you can make

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.480
out of the Labo little motorcycle head.

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:40.000
You can now use that as like an official controller type in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:44.560
So because Mario Kart also lets you do motorcycles, some people forget it's not just

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.360
karts, but you can do motorcycles in that game.

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:48.080
So it's it's pretty legit.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:52.720
So, yeah, motion controls, cardboard button presses, all of that will work.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:53.920
So that's kind of fun.

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.920
So you can do that. And Nintendo says it's not going to stop there.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.720
Nintendo has said there will be more.

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:04.720
It is the first game outside of Nintendo Labo to receive Toy-Con support.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.280
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is.

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:10.200
More titles will be compatible with Nintendo Labo in the future.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.640
Please look forward to it.

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:14.880
Neat. Yeah, kind of neat.

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:18.640
I mean, I don't want to fill my house up with all this fucking cardboard, but I like that

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.040
there's, you know, options.

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:23.080
And who knows, maybe something will be really compelling where I've got to try it.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:29.000
I'm wondering if it will be possible to laminate all that cardboard or to seal it with

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.040
like some sort of resin.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.120
Maybe that would give it some sort of permanence.

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:38.840
How about a music game that actually uses that piano keyboard mania on the switch?

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.640
There was someone that was actually an indie game that was doing that.

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.880
Oh, cool. So I don't know.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.920
That would be awesome. I would love that.

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:48.720
So. All right.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:51.600
And JD in chat says, I wish I could buy the piano separately.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.920
You know, if they start releasing stuff like that, maybe you will be able to maybe you'll be

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:56.400
able to buy the motorcycle stuff separately.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.360
I mean, this is where Labo's at now.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.880
Like half the price.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.040
I mean, it just honestly is really expensive.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.320
I'm kind of surprised Nintendo isn't putting out a little more for the holidays.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.360
Fucking cardboard.

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.760
Like I get the game took some development and everything.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.320
But dude, come on.

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:11.680
It's fucking cardboard.

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:15.680
Now, here we are back to the debate from several weeks and actually to to your point.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:20.320
No, no. To the point, though, if you are looking for just the piano or something like that

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:24.400
and you can find a used copy of the game, you could do that, because remember, they do

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.520
sell each of the pieces separately.

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.880
You can buy the replacement parts.

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.400
I just don't know if you can find it.

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.360
Use. All right.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:37.400
Well, let's move on and talk about let's talk about an old school peripheral.

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:41.280
You know, back when everything back when your peripherals were not made out of cardboard,

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:44.000
they were made out of other stuff.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.880
It's the classic game of the week.

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:49.560
And every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:55.840
hey, you little brats, you should be checking this out or you can just go kick rocks.

01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:00.800
Anyway, once a month, Dark Sakura does the classic peripheral of the month.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:05.960
Since we weren't here last week, which would have been the end of June, Dark Sakura's behind

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:09.680
on the peripherals. So tonight is actually June's peripheral.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:14.360
Yes, I know it's July 1st, but we're just going to ask you to deal with it.

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:19.520
So Dark Sakura, what is the classic peripheral of the month?

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:23.920
I chose the Rez trans vibrator.

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.200
Which great pick.

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:36.680
And contrary to popular parody, the trans vibrator was really not intended to be a sex

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.560
toy. Sorry, kids.

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:43.880
Even though Screw Attack ranked it as the number one best gaming peripheral because of

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:46.120
that reason. There was a whole article about it.

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:47.240
It was actually pretty funny.

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:54.920
But anyway, one of the points for Rez was to bring about the sense of synesthesia.

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:59.520
And if no one if you don't know what synesthesia is, it actually is something that

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:03.760
people like me who have autism or are autistic experience.

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.560
Not everyone does, but some of us do.

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:13.680
It's where one set of sensations trigger another section, almost like, for example,

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.440
people who say they can taste colors.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:25.680
The theory is that their receptors in their brain that that process color goes through

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:28.680
their their taste sensation area as well.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:36.000
Is that similar to that ASMR stuff where like you kind of hear somebody like, you know,

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:41.760
playing with the lady eating the pickles really slowly in the video, right in the

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:44.840
microphone, right? That whole like people like feel the tingles in their neck.

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:45.720
Is that similar to that?

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:50.080
It's similar, but not quite like there's a type of synesthesia.

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:54.520
I was actually watching a thing about it where I got this one particular person

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.560
perceives numbers as patterns.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.360
So it actually triggers like a pattern sense.

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:02.280
You know how people can usually pick up patterns and things.

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:08.640
It triggers a pattern sense and he can do almost any math, thinkable without having

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:12.800
any background training or any advanced mathematics studies just by paying attention

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.200
to the patterns that form in his brain.

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:17.560
He can recite pie practically to infinity.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:22.880
He did it to like, I want to say, a hundred points was pretty crazy.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:26.040
Now, me, I do have synesthesia myself.

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:33.080
For me, it triggers anything that has to do with writing, reading and sound.

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:37.080
Anything that has to do with that all goes through my spatial awareness myself.

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:41.360
So I get a sense of architecture with things that I read or things that I listen to.

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:46.000
That's why I can't listen to some things because it will just make me feel like I'm

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.640
claustrophobic. Seriously.

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:55.720
So back to the trans vibrator, it is it's supposed to add to this experience of

01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:01.160
synesthesia where you have this device that provides haptic feedback.

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:06.760
It's one of it's an early experiment, I'd say, into, you know, more recent technology

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:07.840
that uses haptic feedback.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.600
I mean, our Apple watches Rob haptic feedback.

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:20.360
So at any rate, it was requested by Mizuguchi when he was designing the game and

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.760
wanting to do he was actually going through the arcade division that they wanted

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:26.800
cockpit chairs that would vibrate in time with the music.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:30.760
And even though that didn't come about, he wanted to also use the DualShock controller

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:32.640
for haptic feedback in rez as well.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:33.920
But it wasn't strong enough.

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:42.000
So he went to ASCII to design a peripheral that would function like the DualShock to

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.440
be stronger. And so in the special package version of the PlayStation 2 release of

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:52.080
rez included a USB haptic feedback called a device called a trans vibrator, which is

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:55.400
about a mouse sized peripheral that pulses in time with music.

01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:00.920
And it was designed to either be held or put in a pocket or some people would sit on it.

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:03.720
You know, it had a pouch on it and the pouch could be cleaned, by the way.

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:10.080
So it meant to be hygienic, but you could get a closer sense of synesthesia.

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:16.120
It wasn't true synesthesia, but it engaged another sense to go along with the playing

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:17.360
and interacting with the game.

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:23.240
You know, and again, people will almost turn anything into something sexual because of

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:27.440
course they will. And so there were all the parodies around the game with that.

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.960
Like putting it in your vagina.

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.680
Yeah, but not.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:36.440
At any rate, it also is compatible, though, with two other games.

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:41.800
One of them is with Space Channel 5 Part 2 and another with the Japanese version of

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.240
Disaster Report.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:49.680
They did do some aftermarket versions.

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:52.040
Well, you can still buy them on aftermarket retailers.

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:55.400
There are some third party versions of the same thing.

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.960
They go for about 60 bucks, depending on where you find it.

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.120
They also did reverse engineer the trans vibrators.

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:08.960
So now they have PC drivers out for it so that you can now it was for Windows XP and

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:12.600
Windows 2000, but I'm sure that other people have updated those drivers for current

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:19.800
systems. And on top of that, a guy named Sam Hocovar, if I pronounced that right, wrote

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:21.080
a driver for the Linux kernel.

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:26.240
So now it works for Linux, which makes me think that we would be able to have there's

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:31.280
got to be Mac drivers for it, too, because, I mean, they're both Unix, so whatever.

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:40.520
And then while the trans vibrator never had any other kind of re-release and they made

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:46.080
a nod to it in Res HD, where you can use up to three additional controllers to add that

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.440
trans vibration function back into the game.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:53.520
And I know I've been trying to avoid peripherals that are used for very specific

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:57.040
purposes, even though I've done the twin sticks, because other games will use the twin

01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:04.720
sticks. But this one is so iconic because it really is because, first of all, the major

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:08.440
demand for it that was out at the time and even now people still go for it.

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:13.160
I mean, I wouldn't mind it's one thing I don't have in my collection, but there are

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:18.640
people, you know, who just immediately think of that need to either think of the screw

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:24.720
check joke, lol, haha, dildo, or, you know, think of it in terms of that collecting thing.

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:27.920
And there's usually general, oh, I remember that.

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.320
Not that.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:34.680
Yeah, so I think it's worthy enough to be on the peripheral of the list.

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:37.760
And I like that they've tried to emulate it since then, like when they did Res on the

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:41.000
360, like the controller would kind of vibrate and you could.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Yeah, you put the extra controllers and I guess some people are talking about how

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.280
Luminous Remastered kind of does something with it on the Switch.

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:50.520
It really does set a precedence for that because now, I mean, well, if you think about

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:55.000
it too, we were already sort of having things like this in theaters, like with Captain

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.120
Neo, remember?

01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:56.880
Oh, yeah.

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.800
You'd feel the music through your chair.

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.240
40.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:01.160
Right.

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:04.600
And there's been a concept that's been around for a while, but we never really had anything

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:08.600
like that incorporated into our games pretty much until this game.

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:09.320
Yeah.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.920
I mean, there were others that tried.

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:15.280
I mean, there was also like Sega on the Saturn.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:20.280
There were some fucking weird ass games, like the ones where it was all meant to be played

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:21.120
without the screen.

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:26.000
You played it by sound or the one that like grows your flowers, grow seeds while you're

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:26.800
playing the damn game.

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:30.080
You know, weird stuff like that, that tried to engage other things.

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:35.680
But this was really the one that really brought that sensory feedback into, I think, modern

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:37.080
gaming.

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:37.920
All right.

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:38.400
There it is.

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:42.800
Your classic peripheral of the month, the Res trans vibrator.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.720
The dildo.

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.760
Whatever.

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.560
We're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, guys.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:52.640
We've got plenty more OLR to come, including your emails, some rapid fire news and your

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:58.480
calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype and more gaming news, including a

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:05.520
story about the latest going ons in the PUBG legal drama and some changes in the next Mega

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:07.120
Man collection, the Mega Man X collection.

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:11.280
We'll talk all about all of that when we come back after this break with more of Orange

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:11.920
Lounge Radio.

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:12.400
Stay tuned.

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:25.120
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live, episode number 736 in progress

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.440
for this July 1st of 2018.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:32.080
And as we said at the top of the show, happy Canada Day to all of our friends up north.

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:33.360
Hope you guys had a good day.

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:37.760
And I know this week would be the 4th of July for those of us down here in the States.

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.240
A nice day off of work.

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:45.040
I don't know if you guys have anything fun planned or if you're going to set off fireworks

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:48.480
or as my mom used to call it, you might as well just set the money on fire.

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:51.360
It's just as effective as those safe and sane fireworks are.

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:53.200
Loki, you seem like a fireworks kind of guy.

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.880
Are you going to buy some fireworks and set them off?

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:58.160
No, I'm too smart to not buy those fireworks anymore.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:00.400
Those lame safe and they're just garbage.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.400
Yeah, it's just you might as well forget it.

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.960
Jamie, you and Dan used to buy some and set them off.

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:06.000
Are you doing that this year?

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.640
No, because I have to go to bed at 8 o'clock because I have to work at 5 a.m.

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:09.200
the next day.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.440
Yeah, so I'm going to be using my noise canceling earplugs.

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.000
There you go.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:20.000
And my light canceling eye mask and to cancel the world out.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
And furthermore, with the current state of this country,

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.760
I don't think there's anything we're celebrating.

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:24.640
So fuck it.

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:26.160
Yeah, nothing to celebrate.

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:28.960
We have now completely turned away from what this country was founded to be.

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:29.520
So fuck them.

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:33.200
We should celebrate everybody who registers to vote.

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.880
That's what we should be celebrating.

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:41.840
So, yes, if you live in the United States and you also are completely disgusted with

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:44.960
what's going on, don't just sit on your ass and fucking complain about it.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:46.640
Register the fuck to vote.

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:53.920
And if you have registered to vote, I would like to see you go in and actually vote besides that,

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:54.560
too.

01:16:54.560 --> 01:17:00.560
But go on, go on, go on Twitter and just post.

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:01.520
OLR says vote.

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:03.760
All right.

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:04.480
Make a tag of it.

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:05.360
OLR says vote.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:06.480
All right.

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:07.520
I'll be looking for you.

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:08.480
OLR says...

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:14.000
I might even send you a Pride edition Cards Against Humanity glitter pack.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:14.480
Oh, God.

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:15.360
Did you get the ones with glitter in it?

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:16.560
I bought five of them.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:17.440
I love it.

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:17.680
All right.

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:18.400
Let's get into it.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.560
OLR says it's time for rapid fire news.

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:23.040
Or, oh, as Bobby Blackwolf says in Chad and Old Slogan,

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.200
vote or P Diddy will kill you.

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:27.680
Vote or D Se will kill you.

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:33.600
Anyway, I actually realized Dark Sakura has the same initials as a 3DS.

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:37.760
Anyway, so up to your interpretation, if a Nintendo system will kill you or if Dark Sakura

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:38.320
will.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.720
Anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news.

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:41.520
I'm sneakier.

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:44.640
Loki, it's that time of the year.

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:49.440
It's the beginning of a new month, which means there's more new free games you get for paying

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:50.560
for online.

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:58.080
So starting with PlayStation Plus, in July, we're getting Heavy Rain and Absolver on

01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.280
PlayStation 4.

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:05.200
PlayStation 3 is getting Raymond 3 HD and Deception 4, the Nightmare Princess.

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:10.160
And on the Vita, Space Overlords and Zero Escape, Zero Time Dilemma.

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.320
So that's pretty awesome.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.720
I don't know if there's any other cross play.

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:16.560
Don't see any.

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.720
So we'll have to take it from there.

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:27.440
And then, of course, on the Microsoft side of things, for the Xbox One, for the whole

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:30.960
month of July, you'll be getting Assault Android Cactus for free.

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:35.440
And then from the second half or from the halfway point in July through the halfway

01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:39.120
point in August, Death Squared will be free.

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:45.520
And then as part of the Xbox 360 and also compatible with Xbox One, Virtua Fighter 5,

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:50.240
the final showdown is going to be coming July 1st through the 15th and Tom Clancy's

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:54.720
Splinter Cell Conviction for the second half of July.

01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:57.120
All right.

01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:04.480
And then, in case you're living under a rock, there is a new Overwatch character and it

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:09.680
is a hamster in a giant ball that's a death machine.

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:16.800
So Hammond or Wrecking Ball, I guess, is going to be the character's name, is the new

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.800
tank character in the game.

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:20.240
And he shoots stuff.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:22.640
He rolls around in a ball, has a grappling hook.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.640
It's all the things that you want in a robot hamster.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:25.860
Ball.

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:27.600
And I'm down.

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:28.480
It looks awesome.

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:33.440
I fucking love Hammond or as they call it, Wrecking Balls, the actual game by Hammond.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.640
The little cam.

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:35.440
Little ham.

01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:36.080
Hamtaro.

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:36.720
I love it.

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:38.320
So, yeah, super cute.

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:42.240
I love what people are doing on Twitch, too, with like the races and things like that.

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:45.040
Like they're racing the little balls on the map.

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:45.920
It's adorable.

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:48.800
I've saw some where there's people just spinning around stuff.

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:49.760
Why wouldn't you?

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:50.260
Yeah.

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:58.000
So I haven't played the public test realm yet for this new character, but yeah, it's

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.600
going to be interesting.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:00.320
I can't wait to try it.

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:05.520
Did you see the Overwatch cartoon that someone made where the cat has a mecha?

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:06.020
No.

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:07.520
It was pretty funny.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.040
I found it on Facebook.

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:12.640
There was, you know, I remember Blizzard from one of their panels from an old Blizzcon or

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:16.320
something showed all these Overwatch characters that didn't make the cut because they brainstormed

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:19.280
a ton because there was one based off of that one.

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:20.560
I don't remember the name of the movie.

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:24.240
It's one of those kung fu movies and it has the older lady with the curlers in her hair.

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.280
Oh, Kung Fu Hustle.

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:25.520
Yeah.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.240
Was that it?

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:28.800
And so, um, like she, like they had a character.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:33.760
It was basically her that they cut, unfortunately, but they also had jetpack cat.

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:34.400
That's awesome.

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.640
So it's like, okay, if fucking.

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:42.240
I say we need to go full on, you know, crazy.

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:46.880
Just all of this shit that you'd said, nah, nah, it's, it's too crazy.

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.080
No, bring it all back.

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:48.480
That's right.

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:50.640
We need to make this president cat level.

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:53.120
That's right.

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:55.120
Canvassing president jet pack cat.

01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:57.200
All right.

01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:01.600
If somebody at Blizzard really loves me, they'll make that president jet pack cat or he's got

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:02.720
to be the president or something.

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:04.560
Anyway, uh, let's move on.

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:08.800
So, uh, one of the reasons I was out last week is again, I was in Chicago and I was

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:12.160
going to pride in Chicago, just like dark soccer was at San Francisco pride.

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:12.880
I marched in pride.

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:13.200
Yes.

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:13.840
It was amazing.

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:18.160
Well, sadly, the pride event we weren't at was Seattle, but to be fair, there were lots

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:22.000
of pride events all around the country last week and, um, throughout the month of June

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.880
and some have them a different time of the year, just depending on what's going on in

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:25.680
your town.

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:29.600
But the reason why I bring it up and yes, it is video game related because at the Seattle

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:34.880
pride parade, Nintendo actually marched in the parade as did Niantic.

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:36.800
Nintendo actually had these stickers.

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.480
They were given away that said, play it proud.

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:40.000
And they had little rainbows on them.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.920
Uh, the, the employees are giving out the sticker and I think that's a really cool.

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:47.920
Um, so we actually saw some tweets out there from some of the employees in Nintendo, including

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:49.760
Jose Otero and Bill Trennan.

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:51.360
So, um, yeah, that's really cool.

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:54.240
I wish I could have seen that, but I bet some of you in Seattle did.

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:58.960
And, uh, you know, I know that the whole like corporations with rainbow logos and kind of

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.400
jumping in on pride month.

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:03.520
I know it's a little bit controversial because some people kind of feel like, Oh, they just

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.680
show up for pride month and try to get the gay dollars.

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:06.320
Then they run away.

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:06.800
But you know what?

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:10.880
I remember a time when nobody wanted to touch these issues.

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:16.800
So I mean, it kind of warms my heart in many ways to see like Nintendo with rainbow flags

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:18.480
and employees like marching in the parade.

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.280
Cause that's awesome.

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:24.880
Cause you know, I remember a time in my life when I turned to video games because I kind

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:26.400
of didn't think there was anything else.

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:30.000
So, you know, let's have a moment here.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:30.640
All right.

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:35.680
Anyway, uh, moving from a serious topic like that to a less serious topic, but apparently

01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:37.360
very serious for some people.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:41.200
And that would be the exclusion of Waluigi from Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:46.800
Or, uh, he's a, uh, a support character, I suppose.

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:51.440
Apparently Reggie Fils-Aime has been asked about it in an interview with Vice.

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:54.480
Jesus Christ, this is the level of fuckery we've gotten to.

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:59.520
And, uh, Reggie Fils-Aime said, clearly Nintendo does not hate Waluigi.

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:03.920
I look, Reggie is on record.

01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:06.800
You guys, Nintendo does not hate Waluigi.

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:07.680
Stop it.

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:10.880
They have to like, they have to add more characters as it goes along.

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:14.000
I mean, this isn't the full roster that they announced, obviously.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:20.000
But basically he's pushed it off on Sakurai because it's his game saying Mr.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.080
Sakurai will be aware of the groundswell of support that appeared for Waluigi.

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.640
And in the end, it's his decision to make.

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:28.160
They will bring him in there.

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:30.640
He'll be a character by the time the game comes out.

01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:31.360
Or DLC.

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.000
He'll be in the roster.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:34.160
Right.

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.840
But he's, he's an assist trophy right now.

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:38.480
They're going to have to take out that assist trophy because you don't have

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:40.320
characters that are also assist trophies.

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.080
I'm sure they can remove this trophy.

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:42.720
It's Waluigi.

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:43.360
He can do anything.

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:44.880
I like that.

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:46.000
That's a good perspective.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I also found, by the way, that everything that I thought about his name is actually

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.680
accurate, that it is the pun that I thought it was.

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:55.840
Because Walui would be, means bad or sick.

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:59.280
And so in the G part would be like for person.

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:01.760
So he just means his name means bad person.

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:08.480
Ranma in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Waluigi is trash.

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:09.280
Fuck him.

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:10.480
Go away Waluigi.

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:11.280
No one likes you.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:12.800
Wow.

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:17.920
The views and opinions expressed in our chat room do not reflect those of VOG Network or

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:18.400
ourselves.

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:19.920
Here's that's, that's some powerful words.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.800
It's funny that he has a thing for Daisy and she's like, bitch, no.

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:30.480
To which, to which I say, Ranma, to which I say, wah, that stupid noise is never going

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:30.960
to get old.

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:38.400
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.880
use the passphrase, butcher.

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:41.840
What are you drinking over there?

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:42.240
You're pretty satisfied.

01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:46.560
I mixed the last of my blackberries in with that orange juice that did steal over that

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:47.280
coconut water.

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:47.680
Yeah.

01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:51.440
Made myself my own little delicious cocktail and I get to eat blackberries when I'm done.

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.920
She just mixed a little bit of everything.

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.360
Actually, it's kind of a purple drink.

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.960
I think I would call that a Waluigi.

01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:57.920
I'll take a picture of it.

01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:00.560
You all know because it's actually delicious and doesn't make me sick.

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:03.520
An official Waluigi drink here at OLR.

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:04.240
All right.

01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.720
Then you just have to add a little bit of vodka to top it off.

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:06.960
All right.

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:10.960
Well, you know, oh, by the way, I did finish another infused vodka.

01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:11.280
I know.

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:13.120
I saw the pictures of rose petals, right?

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:17.520
I'd made rose petal vodka and I would be willing to share it with people if they're interested.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:19.440
Uh, let's move on.

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:22.560
Dark Sakura, before you take pictures, you got to do some rapid fire news stories of

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:23.040
your own.

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:26.400
Well, I just took the picture because I can fucking multitask like a bitch.

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:31.120
So anyway, um, also Nintendo is doing some good things for us.

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:34.720
Well, they've already done it and it's probably already sold out by now, but they brought

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:37.600
back the NES classic edition on June 29th.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:43.200
So two days ago from today, um, they've released it for $59.99.

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:47.440
Just like when it released in November, 2016 has all the same consoles on it.

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:55.920
Like, you know, Super Mario Brothers, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, um, and the SNES classic edition

01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:57.520
is still in production.

01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:01.680
Um, but good luck finding them.

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:05.200
I mean, seriously, I've, I've, I've, I've heard from some people who said that they

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:09.600
found them like at, you know, Walmart, which I don't support and other stores.

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.760
So you may still be lucky.

01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:14.640
So if you want it, go and get it while you can.

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:25.520
And I have the final totals for Summer Games Done Quick, which I watched the shit out of.

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:28.800
I saw the countdown when they were trying to reach 2 million.

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:29.760
It was pretty epic.

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:38.000
Um, the total donation amount, um, was, uh, $2,128,069.

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:42.080
And that is over 35,000 people donating.

01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:45.600
The average donation by people was about $60 a donation.

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:51.360
I donated, um, Dan and I did.

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:56.560
Um, and I would actually like to say that when we go up for Awesome Games Done Quick,

01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:01.920
I was actually thinking of, of putting it out there to our listeners of starting like

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:07.040
a small fund so that we could do a mass donation in the name of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:11.520
Oh, donate so we can donate, donate so we can donate big.

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:12.800
Exactly.

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:14.240
You know, interesting.

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:16.720
And I would encourage everyone to do, you know, the little bit here and there.

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:22.080
But I think that if we start accumulating the donations, we can make out that one big

01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:27.280
massive check so that we can ensure that the animals will be killed on the snow.

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:33.200
I save the animals so we can see that little pixel fly off the planet.

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:34.960
The animals will be killed.

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:36.480
No, save the animals.

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:37.760
Save the frames.

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:38.640
Save the animals.

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.280
You're a terrible human being.

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:41.520
All right.

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:41.760
Yeah.

01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:46.160
JD says, where would you accept donations to that wouldn't take a percentage fee?

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:46.720
My hand.

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:49.520
No, give me, give me money.

01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:50.400
I'll work on it.

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:51.520
Yeah, we'll see.

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:51.760
Okay.

01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:52.880
Dark soccer is going to work on it.

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:54.740
All right.

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:59.200
Meanwhile, let's travel the world and check out some release dates.

01:27:59.200 --> 01:27:59.700
Loki.

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:01.200
There's not much.

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:06.400
I mean, honestly, July is usually a very dead month when it comes to game releases.

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:07.600
So we've got two.

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:10.800
We've got run bow coming out on Nintendo switch.

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:18.480
And then your pun title of the week, red faction gorilla, the remarse stirred edition.

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:21.040
That's on PC.

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:25.700
That's it.

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:27.300
All right.

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:30.240
Well, let's see what the news is like in Japan.

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:32.400
On July the 5th on PlayStation four.

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:37.600
Zankai zero is out as well as a classic edition of far cry three.

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:40.320
And that's really it for Japan this week on the PlayStation four.

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:46.240
PlayStation Vita also gets that Zankai zero as well as a game called seven days.

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.840
Not to be confused with the ring.

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:49.200
It's actually called seven days.

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.160
Anata two.

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.120
So Guso.

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:52.960
Nano Kaka comes out.

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:59.680
I didn't realize that on the Vita in the U S did you know next week on the Vita in the U S

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:02.240
good old, uh, OLR favorite title.

01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:06.000
Muv Luv is coming out in the U S we're getting our own.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.080
It's that same company that got denied the, uh, the, uh, translation.

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:14.960
Anyway, plus rapture, uh, nothing on the switch this week.

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:17.120
It is a quiet week on the switch in Japan.

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:19.120
So there's your Japanese releases.

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:22.160
How about the UK dark soccer on the third?

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:24.720
And really the third is the only day with stuff coming out.

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:28.240
We have drastic world evolution for Xbox and PlayStation.

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:33.680
We had red faction gorilla remastered again, same, uh, consoles.

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:37.360
And also on the same consoles is Warhammer 40 K Inquisitor martyr.

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:40.080
That is it.

01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:40.720
Symphony.

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:44.640
All right, let's get to the mailbag.

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:46.000
We'll have to read fast too.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.960
Cause every week you guys send us emails and sometimes we read them.

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:51.760
I have hiccups.

01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:53.120
I'm just going to turn it over to Jamie.

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:54.800
I hate radio guys.

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:57.600
Biggest nightmare is hitting me right now.

01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:58.640
So Jamie, take it away.

01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:00.320
Participate at orange.radio.com.

01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:02.240
I'm going to be reading fast cause Jamie's got to go.

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:03.760
Cause she's got work in the morning.

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:04.160
Hi guys.

01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:05.520
Just wanted to bring up a few things from last up.

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:07.040
So that kind of struck a nerve with me.

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:08.160
This kind of long email.

01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:08.480
Sorry.

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:10.720
Regardless, I still have been a fan of the show for years.

01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:11.680
I will continue to listen.

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:14.960
First thing I hope I didn't hear the wrong way and clarify if I am,

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:17.600
but dark soccer mentioned the kids included in last of us.

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:19.520
Part two is some sort of tokenism.

01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:22.080
I see his growth of the character and the last of us left behind.

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:25.520
We saw Ellie lose her best friend who in the end realized she had feelings for

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:25.920
the writing.

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:29.520
The performances felt incredibly natural and it wasn't shoehorned in.

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:32.240
I feel like this writing was present in the last of us part two trailer as well

01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:36.160
and left behind has earned the believability of her sexuality.

01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:38.640
And her sexuality isn't pointed out in an obnoxious way throughout the

01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:40.000
entirety of the last of us.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.280
The question to this is what is the right way of presenting LGBT characters

01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:44.240
in a trailer?

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:48.720
And is it any representation of LGBT in a big event like E3 tokenism?

01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:50.080
First of all, I've never played last of us.

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:53.520
So I have any idea about the character story and kind of don't give a shit

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:55.360
cause I don't want to play last of us.

01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:58.400
But to be fair, you did call it tokenism.

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:01.440
I said it seemed like tokenism or if I called it tokenism is more that I

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:06.480
thought it seemed like it cause on the surface, you know, it seems like

01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:10.400
something that a big company is going to do is throw a bone to try to attract

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:11.840
a more diverse audience.

01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:12.400
Right.

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.760
You know, here's the thing.

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.200
I wouldn't put it past Sony.

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:18.640
I haven't played the games either because I'm just not big on scary

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:20.160
zombie type games right here.

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:26.080
However, I was aware because we talked about it a couple or a year or two

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:27.760
ago when that DLC came out.

01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:31.600
I remember the big reveal about her sexuality in the DLC.

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:35.600
So therefore, I know that this is something that's been and as the

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:38.000
emailer kind of points out, it was developed then.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.440
And so that's why to me, I'm kind of like, okay, I mean, this isn't just

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:43.680
like surprise, everybody's gay.

01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:45.440
Like this isn't like that type of thing.

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:50.000
So I, I think what they did was appropriate, but that's, that's a

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.040
personal perspective.

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:52.640
Again, I'm not a lesbian.

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:53.760
I'm also ace.

01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:57.760
So I don't really see what the fuck point there is that any type of

01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:59.920
romantic subplot is going to add to a game anyway.

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.280
It's just, I mean, okay.

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:04.560
I like it for Mass Effect cause for me, that's like 50% of BioWare games

01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:05.520
is who you're going to romance.

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:10.720
But the same thing anyway is just, I'm, I'm, I'm actually a really a lot

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:11.360
more as of late.

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:13.600
Why does there have to be fucking romance involved in the game anyway?

01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:18.320
Well, just to, to, to kind of put the email in perspective, I think as

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:21.040
part of this, cause I think this is written respectfully and you know,

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:22.560
they say they're a fan.

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:29.040
Um, what if the next, let's say the next big reveal is Mass Effect 4 and

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:34.320
in the Mass Effect 4 trailer, they show, uh, Shepard is back magically

01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:35.440
somehow space magic.

01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:38.480
Shepard is back and Shepard makes out with Kayden in the trailer.

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:39.920
Is that going to be tokenism?

01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:43.920
Well, no, because you can also pick whoever you fucking romance in a

01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:44.640
Mass Effect game.

01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:45.840
Okay.

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:46.640
Fair, fair.

01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:47.920
So there is, there is that choice involved.

01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:49.520
And besides that, my Shepard is always female.

01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:51.040
So I instantly thought femshep.

01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:51.200
Okay.

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:54.560
So if femshep makes out with Liara in the trailer, is that tokenism?

01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:58.160
Well, they are technically agendered.

01:32:58.160 --> 01:32:58.560
Yeah.

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:01.120
How about they all have sex with everybody?

01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:01.680
No, I'm just kidding.

01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:01.840
Okay.

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:02.320
That's fine.

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:03.520
All right.

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:06.160
No, my thought is because again, I don't play that game.

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:07.280
I don't know that game.

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:09.520
I haven't really been interested in that game.

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:12.000
If it's something that's been in development, that's great.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:17.680
I just think this, that if it's something that was expected, then that's one thing.

01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:19.520
And I'll take it back in the case of this game.

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:23.120
But if they'd like say introduce new game and they have two girls kissing

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:28.800
that if we don't have any context around it, then it can seem very much like,

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.240
Oh, by the way, gay stuff.

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:31.280
Come on people.

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:33.600
So it's kind of like the corporate logos in rainbow.

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.920
It's not about, yeah, it's like the corporate logos in rainbow.

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:37.440
Put up or shut it up type of thing.

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:38.080
Exactly.

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:38.320
Yeah.

01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:39.520
You can't have a rainbow logo.

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:43.920
Now that I, you know, know a little bit more about the character, then that's fine.

01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:45.280
I'm fine with it.

01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:46.000
I don't care.

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:49.040
It's clearly not tokenism in that case.

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:56.320
But if it was just like random trailer new game, if Anthem had two girls making out while

01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:01.520
two boys are making out and then two completely weird tentacle aliens are making out that

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:04.640
are clearly of whatever the gender is in their particular species.

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:05.140
Yes.

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:09.760
That would seem a little bit, by the way, rainbow logos.

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:10.240
Come on.

01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:12.000
BioWare loves you gays.

01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:13.760
Exactly.

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:14.880
Yeah, I get it.

01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:15.360
I get it.

01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:18.320
I mean, to be fair, I get the perspective kind of you're coming from as well.

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:19.040
So yeah.

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:19.440
Okay.

01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:23.360
Second, why is everyone comparing games to other things is kind of annoying to me.

01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:27.680
Starlink isn't as open as No Man's Sky and has a narrative present throughout the trailers.

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:29.360
It has very little semblance to it.

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:31.600
And I don't think it's fair to compare games to others.

01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:36.400
This affected games like Battleborn, for example, which had MOBA gameplay, unlike Overwatch.

01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:42.480
Even then, if something is similar to another game, it can present competition and iteration,

01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:44.720
which can improve the gaming industry.

01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:48.880
For example, Fortnite and PUBG, which are two different games of the same genre, or

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:49.920
Tomb Raider and Uncharted.

01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:54.320
People like to have, though...

01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:57.200
I mean, and this is something that I don't know, because I'm honestly not a big fan of

01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:00.240
comparisons along those lines.

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:04.800
But at the same time, people like to link it to something that's familiar to them.

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:05.360
Exactly.

01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:08.160
It's how we tend to describe things.

01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:11.280
Like, if I were to say, like, I have to do this all the time.

01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:12.960
Like, we'll be out playing Pokemon Go.

01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:15.600
And then I'm like, hold on, I got to switch to Ingress real fast.

01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:16.480
What's Ingress?

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:17.680
How do you play Ingress?

01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:22.080
And I have to kind of catch myself going, well, it's kind of like Pokemon Go.

01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:24.720
Even though in the back of my head, I'm like, it's actually nothing like Pokemon Go.

01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:28.000
But like, that's how this person is going to know it because they play Pokemon Go.

01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:32.080
So at least they're going to understand how the real world kind of locations play into it.

01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:36.000
So I think sometimes you kind of like have to compare to be able to explain something

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:36.960
to someone.

01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:40.640
But really, the best way to know it is to try it your damn self.

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:42.400
Well, it's sort of like the same thing for me.

01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:47.120
Like, if I go on Facebook, okay, and say, you know, I hate marshmallows.

01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:49.760
And someone goes, well, I love marshmallows.

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:50.880
And I hate this, this and this.

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:54.560
I'm like, well, what the fuck do those other things have to do with the fact that marshmallows

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:55.440
are fucking disgusting?

01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:57.360
Well, here's the thing.

01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:02.400
I love marshmallows, but you have every right to hate them because I also know that you

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:03.280
have your thing.

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:04.480
I like mayonnaise.

01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:06.080
I hate mayonnaise.

01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:06.880
I hate ketchup.

01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:07.600
You like it.

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:09.680
Do you know what the perfect solution is to this problem?

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:10.240
Dark Sakura?

01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:12.000
You can have the marshmallows and I'll have the mayonnaise.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:12.800
Oh, my God.

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:15.360
If only we knew how to solve all of our problems.

01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:18.640
Oh, I thought it was, you know, putting mayonnaise inside of marshmallows.

01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:21.600
No, even that.

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:22.800
Now, given I grew up.

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:26.320
And if you ever watch Emmy made in Japan, she tried this.

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:28.080
I grew up eating mayonnaise on pears.

01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:30.160
It's a Southern thing.

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:33.120
Don't you?

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:34.560
I will take the marshmallows.

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:37.840
You may have the mayonnaise, but marshmallows are disgusting and so is ketchup.

01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:44.640
Anyway, third, Sony have been releasing games in the spring and summer seasons rather than

01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:45.600
the fall and winter seasons.

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:50.240
Lately, they're less likely to have more games this year after E3, they released God of War

01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:54.080
in Detroit, become human this year, and we'll have Spider-Man in September.

01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:55.200
Those are some big games.

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:58.960
Hopefully dreams can have a beta in winter and released in the spring.

01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:03.040
I do agree, however, that their games are becoming similar to that uncharted slash The

01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:06.240
Last of Us third person cinematic stealth action gameplay formula.

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:10.400
To be honest, I'm not that interested in their lineup either.

01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:14.000
Death Stranding especially looks incredibly dull to me as someone who hasn't played the

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.120
Metal Gear Solid games.

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:17.920
Once again, I really like listening to the show every week.

01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:19.280
I look forward to the discussion.

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:20.080
That's from Multi.

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:24.160
Thank you for a very good and well thought out and actually decently grammar email.

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:28.560
And I think you are right on the Sony thing about how they have a lot of these similar

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:30.400
types of games, but it does well for them.

01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:35.040
I mean, look how well received Uncharted and Last of Us and those games do like people

01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:35.920
want more of it.

01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:38.000
So that's what Sony's delivering.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.920
They latch on to what's going to make the money.

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.440
I do want to read one comment from our chat.

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:43.600
I know you're trying to run through these dark soccer, but I think this is a really

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:45.840
good response to the whole tokenism thing.

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:52.640
So JD in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com said it's hard to get actual LGBT representation

01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:54.160
without romance.

01:37:54.160 --> 01:38:00.160
We're more than who we love, but there's a long tradition of not showing that as a means

01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:00.960
of erasing us.

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:04.640
That's a very interesting perspective and kind of right.

01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:12.480
Like, is there a way to be lesbian, gay, without having or transgender, let's say?

01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:16.400
Because remember in transgender is not a sexuality, though.

01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:16.960
It's not.

01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:18.400
But here's my point.

01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:23.360
Because Mass Effect Andromeda caught a lot of shit because you had that character that

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:24.560
was dead named herself.

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:25.040
Exactly.

01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:26.160
I'm transgender.

01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:26.800
Look at me.

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:30.640
I'm transgender and I'm going to do all these things that a transgender person actually

01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:31.280
would never do.

01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:38.720
I do know I have a couple of trans friends who will just be upfront about it.

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:42.720
You may have known me as this, or if we were in the same circles, you might have known

01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:43.120
this name.

01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:44.240
That was me then.

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:47.840
You know, I've known people who've said that, but usually they were people that you knew

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:50.480
or the people that I knew.

01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:50.720
Right.

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:52.400
As they were going through this transition.

01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:52.720
Yeah.

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:56.160
But at the same time, yeah, you're correct.

01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:57.680
No one's really going to dead name themselves.

01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:01.600
Anyway, I don't want to drag it out, but I just thought that was a really good point

01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:02.160
from JD.

01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:05.760
But also, though, my thing, too, is, though, and I'm not referring necessarily to romance

01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:08.480
in the case of it being a gay romance.

01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:09.680
I have a thing.

01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:15.920
It just seems like romance has become such an integral part to any game or movie or book.

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:21.200
People have to be fucking or something or falling in love.

01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:26.960
And I'm like, can't you have a relationship in a book or movie or a game that is based

01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:29.120
on really strong friendship?

01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:32.560
Or how about something where the thing you learn to love is yourself?

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:35.680
Because if you can't love yourself, how the hell you gonna love somebody else?

01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:37.280
Can I get an amen up in here?

01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:37.920
Next email.

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:38.980
Okay.

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:43.040
I've been listening to the show for a while, and I was wondering who is this, Ron?

01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:45.360
By the way, it's R-A-N-M-A, just letting you know.

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:48.160
This is also from another Jamie, which is great.

01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:49.920
I don't have a nickname on here, though.

01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:55.520
Guy that calls in when you open the Skyplines, you all seem to be friends and have some history.

01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:59.040
I have no idea of if I even said his name correctly.

01:39:59.040 --> 01:39:59.680
Lol.

01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:00.880
Explain this person.

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:01.680
Lol.

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:06.560
By the way, I've listened to damn near every gaming podcast, and OLR feels like home base

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:07.120
for me.

01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:08.880
I look forward to hearing you all every week.

01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:10.400
Oh, thank you, Name Twin.

01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:10.900
Thank you.

01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:14.000
Ron has been our buddy for an age.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:18.720
He's been there practically since the beginning, you know, through the live 365 era.

01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:20.480
He's been with us for an age.

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:21.520
He's been out here.

01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:23.040
We've gone to conventions.

01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:25.920
He has his own show called Anime Jam Session with his buddies.

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:26.420
Yes.

01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:29.520
And he's just a really awesome guy.

01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:30.480
And on top of that,

01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:33.200
And he needs to not pay his friends money to write emails about him.

01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:33.920
No, I'm kidding.

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:34.480
I'm totally kidding.

01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:34.960
I'm kidding.

01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:40.960
But I've, you know, we've all we've become really just good friends anyway.

01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:43.920
I mean, I'd consider him part of part of our family here.

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:44.420
Oh, for sure.

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:52.000
And the thing is, emailer, before we did not know Ranma before this show.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.680
We know Ranma and many people that call in, not just Ranma, but many of the regulars.

01:40:57.680 --> 01:40:58.800
You know, we love our regulars.

01:40:58.800 --> 01:40:59.760
We love new people, too.

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:01.680
Everybody should feel free to call in and participate.

01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:02.800
It's for everybody.

01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:04.080
It's where every gamer has a voice.

01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:09.600
But like, there are so many people that we have met and become friends with and do feel

01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:11.600
like family because of this show.

01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:15.440
And it is it is a feeling I can't really describe.

01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:16.400
We find our tribe.

01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:17.440
We've created this thing.

01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:18.400
Yeah, we find our tribe.

01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:19.200
I like that.

01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:19.920
We sure do.

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:21.200
That's a good note to end that on.

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:22.320
You know, we have one last email.

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:24.320
Merry evening, peoples.

01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:25.920
By the way, this is Redertainment.

01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:29.280
I've noticed an odd thing in an article posted by an outlet.

01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:32.240
Sky has stated he has reservations about Polygon.

01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:38.000
This, hold on, let me find the article real quick.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:43.040
So the article here is the seven year old Sims mobile game is being pulled from Chinese

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:43.600
app stores.

01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:49.600
The headline of the story leads with the game being removed from Chinese app stores.

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:54.000
But the other six countries affected by this are predominantly Muslim countries.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:59.920
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar and Egypt.

01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:05.280
The article also cites a source from a company manager from EA that the game is being removed

01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:06.640
for regional standards.

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:10.560
Speculation among fans is that the content is being removed.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:12.640
Wait, never mind.

01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:14.080
I skipped to the same line again.

01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:18.720
Speculation among fans is that the content is being removed because of regional standards

01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:20.080
in Muslim countries.

01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:21.600
I'd like to join that speculation.

01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:25.920
It is my honest belief that this game was pulled from the app stores that are predominantly

01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:29.840
Muslim countries because the game no longer meets the regional standards of those countries.

01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:34.000
Remove the game from Chinese app stores at the same time may just be coincidence.

01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:38.240
Anyway, the point of me sending this email, why lead with the game being removed from

01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:43.200
Chinese app stores when the game is being removed from many countries, from many countries

01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:46.160
app stores, most of whom are majority Muslim?

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:50.240
Isn't the game being removed from the app store of majority Muslim countries the lead?

01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:52.960
Bottom line, Sky is correct to distrust articles from Polygon.

01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:53.840
Yes, Sky is correct.

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:55.040
Pause to allow for gloating.

01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:55.680
Stay black.

01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:56.720
Redertainment.

01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:59.120
I distrust headlines from a lot of places.

01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:02.000
Here, you know, articles are not right.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.320
Or, you know, most websites are not writing articles with headlines to accurately reflect

01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:07.440
what's in the story anymore.

01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:10.560
They're writing headlines to get you to click on on Facebook.

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:13.200
I mean, that's the reality.

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:16.640
So, you know, US versus China is very in right now.

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:20.640
Thanks to all this talk about terror tariffs and all this stuff you see on the national

01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:20.880
news.

01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:25.120
I'm not going to get into politics, but that's the reality is US versus China is super in

01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:25.520
right now.

01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:30.000
So, I think that's what you're seeing with some of that, you know.

01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:36.880
To be fair, as much as I don't want to give this particular website credit, I will, because

01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:37.840
I'm a fair person.

01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:44.800
To be fair, the population of China is much bigger than any other country in the world.

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:49.040
So, it is fair to kind of lead off with China because it is the most populated.

01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:51.600
But I think an accurate headline would have been game is removed.

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:52.640
Your larger world power.

01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:56.320
Game was removed from eight countries or whatever the total number was.

01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:59.280
I'm sorry, I didn't catch the whole number, but may have been a more accurate reflection

01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:00.480
of what's going on.

01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:08.400
But anyway, Bobby Blackwell in chat says, also realized that on most web websites, the author

01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:11.600
of the article does not write the headline.

01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:14.400
The editor does after reading the article.

01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:15.360
That's a very good point.

01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:21.360
JD also brings up, it might also be that China has its own internet and therefore its own

01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:22.080
app store.

01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:23.520
So, some thoughts from our chatters.

01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:25.440
Any other emails or was that it?

01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:26.800
That was it.

01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:30.640
And on that note, I will bid everyone a fond adieu for the evening.

01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:31.600
Well, thanks for being here.

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:34.160
As always, Dark Sakura, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?

01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:36.640
I'm going to fucking eat another one of these chocolates.

01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:38.960
I don't care how sick it makes me because it's amazing.

01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:40.400
They are pretty fucking good, aren't they?

01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:41.360
Oh my God, yes.

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:42.240
Enjoy.

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:43.680
All right, there you go.

01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:50.000
So, if you want to send us an email for a future week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:53.600
We're going to get into some more news and I'm going to apologize because I can't seem

01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:55.760
to get rid of these hiccups, but I'm going to do my best.

01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:58.880
So, let's go to Loki to get some gaming news.

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:01.840
All right, so this is unfortunate.

01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:08.080
There is a whole issue with companies suing other companies for copying things.

01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:14.160
So, for example, you know, you had the folks at Bluehole that were suing Epic Games for

01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:17.200
copying.

01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:17.760
No, I don't know.

01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:18.560
Don't they use bleach?

01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:19.920
They probably don't.

01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:20.720
Weren't you leaving?

01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:23.920
You're the one who brought it back stuff earlier, I'm just saying.

01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:30.960
So, unfortunately, you know, they were accused of copying something and we'll get to that

01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:35.200
in a little bit, but this is another game that actually has been on my radar because

01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:39.280
I have it in my, I want list for Steam.

01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:40.960
It's a game called Donut Country.

01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:45.840
It's a sort of, I guess, sort of like a reverse katamari game.

01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:51.520
So, basically, you have a hole that you control that you suck up things in and as, you know,

01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:56.080
things fall into the hole, the hole gets bigger and you can drop more things into the hole.

01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:02.640
So, this game's been in development for a while and because of that and with the new

01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:07.360
information that's been out there, somebody has stolen that idea and put out a game called

01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:10.560
Hole.io because that's so fucking clever.

01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:11.440
Holy moly.

01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:17.680
It's on the iOS store and, you know, I went into this endeavor to make something meaningful

01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:21.280
to people and spent a long time trying to figure out what it looks like.

01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:24.880
I had to make all the little details myself.

01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:25.920
I wanted it to matter.

01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:30.320
They just took the elevator pitch, the unique selling point.

01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:36.320
It is the message that can, it's the message that content doesn't matter.

01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:39.680
The message is if you can find the content for free, take it.

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:47.200
So, that's kind of unfortunate that someone kind of stole the concept of the game, but

01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:49.280
I'm looking for the actual game coming out.

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:53.520
And I guess this is why companies don't announce stuff way in advance anymore because people

01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:55.040
will just flat out fucking steal it.

01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:56.420
Yeah.

01:46:57.120 --> 01:46:59.920
So, I mean, there's a lot of games that are kind of like that.

01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:02.640
So, I don't know.

01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:07.440
And apparently, I think this company has been doing this for a while.

01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:12.400
There's other companies, you know, they've had that ridiculous fish scene had an issue.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.600
There was a different publisher that released a game called Ninja Fishing that was very

01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:18.100
similar.

01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:24.320
There was, I guess, another, I don't know.

01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:28.320
It just, it's unfortunate.

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:32.880
But, you know, honestly, though, even though they stole the premise of the game, it's going

01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:34.160
to come out to the polish.

01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:40.880
And I think that this whole this game is going to be much more polished when it comes out.

01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:45.600
This other like whole IO thing was just made using like Unity assets from the store, like

01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:46.960
$20 Unity assets, right?

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:48.240
Yeah, it looks really cheap.

01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:48.740
Silly.

01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:53.200
And I mean, that's you see that a lot of times he's really fast, like kind of make a quick

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:53.920
buck game.

01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:55.840
So, whatever.

01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:00.480
I mean, it does suck, but true quality wins out in the end, usually.

01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:03.280
All right.

01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:08.000
So, the latest and greatest of what's going on in EA Star Wars drama.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:12.800
So, you might remember in October, EA shut down Visceral Games that was working on a

01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:14.400
secret Star Wars project.

01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:19.760
And Amy Henning, who is famous for Uncharted, kind of going back to that email earlier,

01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:20.800
was a big part of this.

01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:25.280
But Amy Henning left the company and there was really no talk about what happened to

01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:27.120
the game, what happened to anything with this.

01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:33.040
Well, at a conference called Game Lab in Barcelona this past week, Amy Henning talked to Eurogamer

01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:39.040
about how she actually left EA in January of this year and was starting up her own new

01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:43.280
independent studio, but hadn't had a chance to announce what's going on or talk about

01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:43.760
what it is.

01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:49.440
Apparently, she was asked about, is she still the creative director of a Star Wars project?

01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:51.440
The reply was, I'm not.

01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:54.000
I haven't worked at EA since January, technically legally.

01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:55.360
This is the problem.

01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:58.960
It was hard enough for them, but people were immediately asking them, is Amy working with

01:48:58.960 --> 01:48:59.520
you?

01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:04.000
And the answer was, well, we're in negotiations, you know, because that's the way these things

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:04.480
go.

01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:06.880
I haven't been in, but look, I get along with all those people.

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:10.960
I consider even the guys on the executive team friends, but it made it awkward because

01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:15.280
it was like, I never got the chance to announce that I'm not at EA, so I just need to pull

01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:18.400
off that bandaid at some point, but also had nothing to announce.

01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:22.480
It makes it sound like I just went home, but I'm doing all this stuff, working on all kinds

01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:22.960
of things.

01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:26.720
And thanks to that last story, you know why she isn't talking about them.

01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:30.960
Yes, because somebody would probably just steal them, but she's working independently

01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:32.000
and that's what's going on.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:38.080
So that project is on the shelf now is the last word on that.

01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:42.240
So rest in peace, EA Star Wars project.

01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:46.320
Look, you want to take this next one that was marked for Jamie before she left?

01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:50.560
I'm sure we can do that because I still have this stupid hiccup thing going on.

01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:51.040
I hate it.

01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:54.080
Oh no, I'm gonna get more water while you do these stories.

01:49:54.080 --> 01:50:02.160
All right, so Mega Man X5, you know, was just recently released, re-released, and they've

01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:06.320
actually taken out some of these Guns N' Roses references.

01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:13.440
So with the Mega Man X Legacy Collection 1 and 2, I'm not even really sure what the original

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:14.800
references were.

01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:16.240
Oh, I guess so.

01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:18.400
Let's see.

01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:24.240
They had, I guess it was with the localization.

01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:30.880
Oh, so they had, you know, you know, and now that I think of it, didn't they have like

01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:35.760
references to other stuff or Guns N' Roses stuff and like Super Mario Bros 3 as well,

01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:37.840
you know, with the Koopas and stuff.

01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:42.640
Lemmy Koopa after Lemmy and then...

01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:46.880
They were all named after like punk rock icons, like Wendy O.

01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:49.600
I guess it makes sense that they all kind of like punk rock anyways.

01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:50.400
I mean, it makes sense.

01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:56.080
But yeah, in this game, the boss robots or the big robot things were, they changed names.

01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:58.080
They didn't use the literal Japanese translations.

01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:03.360
They made them like, they were like parody names off like people that were in Guns N'

01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:03.760
Roses.

01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:04.640
It was a little silly.

01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:10.080
Yeah, so they decided to go ahead and just basically said that in our mission to make

01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:14.160
these collections an authentic Mega Man X experience, we took an opportunity to better

01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:21.840
align the names of the Mega Man X5 Mavericks across all regions for better narrative cohesion

01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:26.240
across the series, making the names more aligned with the original Japanese versions.

01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:32.720
We hope the fans appreciate our intent on unifying the Mega Man X Maverick naming conventions

01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:33.360
after all.

01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:37.360
Yes, they do.

01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:40.080
Interesting.

01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:41.680
I don't know.

01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:45.280
It's neat, I guess, that they did that.

01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:49.440
But no one else is also neat and interesting.

01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:55.600
This whole lawsuit with PUBG Corp and Epic over Fortnite.

01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:59.920
So they dropped the lawsuit and there's no, we don't know why.

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:04.960
They just, they filed the dismissal and that's that.

01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:12.480
And my thoughts, maybe they just didn't, I mean, honestly, the argument was kind of shallow

01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:12.880
anyways.

01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:18.640
They didn't really have any sort of way of, I don't know, they're like, oh yeah, each

01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:22.240
game has a frying pan and it's a similar type of gameplay.

01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:24.160
I don't think that was really much to go on.

01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:30.160
Um, but wasn't there something where like in one country they essentially have like

01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:31.360
the same parent company?

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:32.560
Yes.

01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:33.200
Yeah.

01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:33.600
Yes.

01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:38.160
And so it's like they're essentially suing themselves in one area.

01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:42.240
So it's a little, you know, maybe together they can work a little.

01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:44.320
So it may have had something to do with that.

01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:47.040
It may have been because their suit was kind of weak.

01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:48.880
Who knows?

01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:51.360
But I don't know.

01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:56.000
One other thing that we didn't mention though that I wanted to was there's another lawsuit

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:01.840
actually going on with Bethesda and Warner games and see Bethesda released this very

01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:06.400
popular game that everybody's aware of now called, um, fallout shelter.

01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:13.680
And so now Warner games had a company, I think that actually had that originally worked on

01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:19.680
fallout shelter or had access to that code or something came out with a Westworld themed

01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:26.160
game that looks extremely like fallout shelter, even to the point of having the same type

01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:32.720
of bugs in their code at launch that fallout shelter had, which made them suspicious that

01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:37.600
perhaps they were using our old code to create this game perhaps.

01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:40.400
And so now there's a whole suit against that as well.

01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:44.800
So we'll have to see how that plays out, but that's kind of where things are going.

01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:49.280
Lawsuits, lawsuits, lawsuits, some clarifications in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:52.640
Dungeon buster says 10 cent has a major stake in Epic.

01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:55.520
They pretty much own them, but only a minor stake in blue holes.

01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:57.600
So they don't own them at least not yet.

01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:03.200
And Bobby Black Wolf says, honestly, Bethesda finding stolen code by looking at the bugs

01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:05.040
is the most with the thing ever.

01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:05.760
Yes, it is.

01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:06.320
True point.

01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:11.040
And some light on the super Mario brothers three localization that you brought up there.

01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:13.760
Dark Tetsuya says the super Mario thing.

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:19.040
A lot of them were references to famous musicians like Lemmy was Lemmy killmeister of Motorhead.

01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:21.280
Roy was Roy Orbison.

01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:23.520
And there were a couple others and JD follows up.

01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:25.600
Wendy Williams, Aggie pop.

01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:29.760
And Larry was named after no one, but that was all North American localization.

01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:31.440
Crap.

01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:32.320
We need one more name.

01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:38.240
Larry done inky pinky blinky and Sue.

01:54:41.920 --> 01:54:43.040
Or is it Clyde?

01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:45.120
I think it was Clyde and Pac-Man and Sue and Ms.

01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:46.560
Pac-Man anyway.

01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:48.160
All right.

01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:55.280
Moving on one more story for you guys before we open up the Skype line over at orange lounge

01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:56.960
radio, all one word on Skype.

01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:00.960
How many of you guys have played Shaq Fu a legend reborn?

01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:03.120
I'm shocked to Loki that you haven't checked this out.

01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:05.520
I wasn't a fan of the first Shaq Fu game.

01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:06.480
I mean, it looked okay.

01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:08.560
Well, it's, it's a legendary born.

01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:10.960
Now the physical edition just came out this past week.

01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:16.000
Apparently physical editions of the game have a leaflet with instructions on how to unlock

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:22.080
a bonus game called Barack Fu, the adventures of dirty Barry.

01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:26.080
Which of course the main character is very much Barack Obama.

01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:31.440
And I believe the way American parody laws and so forth are written.

01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:33.440
You can parody politicians all you want.

01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:38.960
If you want to do a game about Shaquille O'Neal and use his likeness, you have to pay him

01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:39.280
money.

01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:42.640
You have to, he has to sign away his likeness.

01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:48.720
But the reason why you had all these political figures in, uh, MBA jam back in the day is

01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:53.920
because with politicians, you don't owe them that same thing because they are politicians.

01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:56.800
They are in the public eye, therefore they can be parodied.

01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:02.080
So, uh, Barack Obama, I guess made a good target for a game like this because they did

01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:04.240
not have to get his permission for it.

01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:09.840
So they say, and yes, the game calls itself a parody of one of the greatest heroes of

01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:10.400
our time.

01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:19.520
As the ex POTUS on notice, you will step in when the police can't figure out why a number

01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:23.120
of celebrities have been killed in order to solve the case yourself.

01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:27.040
And there are some trailers out there if you want to check it out called Barack Fu, which

01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:29.200
is a side game of Shaq Fu.

01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:29.920
Let's face it.

01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:35.040
They are both going to be shitty, but good for some walls, right?

01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:36.080
Yep.

01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:36.400
All right.

01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:37.360
Yeah.

01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:39.840
Dark to see in chat says, I almost want to check that out.

01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:40.960
Yep.

01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:41.840
All right.

01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:44.560
Anyway, let's get to the Skype line.

01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:47.360
Orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:51.040
I'll do the best I can to talk to you through these hiccups while we wait to see if any

01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:51.760
calls come in.

01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:54.320
Do we have any last minute stories?

01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:55.200
I don't.

01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:57.520
I looked, we burned through a lot of stuff.

01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:00.320
It seemed like it was a busy news week, but we burned through a lot of it.

01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:02.800
I mean, we can just kind of add more fuel to the fire.

01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:07.520
Basically, uh, Bethesda's Todd Howard said Sony is preventing fallout 76 cross play.

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:08.720
Oh, I heard that one too.

01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:08.960
Yeah.

01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:12.000
And remember they, they said we're listening.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:13.840
We hear your concerns.

01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:16.320
Yeah, but they're not going to, they don't hear them right now.

01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:20.480
They're trying to figure it out for six months from now, maybe, but they're not hearing it

01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:20.880
right now.

01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:21.840
All right.

01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:23.920
We got a call coming in, so let's get to it.

01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:24.240
Uh, hello.

01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:25.120
You're on orange lounge radio.

01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:25.440
Who's this?

01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:27.840
Hey, uh, Robert.

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:28.240
Sorry.

01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:29.520
What's on your mind?

01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:31.680
Uh, no, hold on.

01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:36.560
Um, well, yeah, I wanted to bring up pinball arcade.

01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:38.080
Oh, right.

01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:39.040
Fuck that ended.

01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:40.480
And I forgot to buy the tables.

01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:41.280
God damn it.

01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:43.120
Oh, yeah.

01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:43.360
Yeah.

01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:45.360
I was going to ask you exactly that.

01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:47.760
Cause you didn't exactly mention daddy.

01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:49.040
God damn it.

01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:50.160
No, I forgot.

01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:51.600
And the month is now over.

01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:52.640
No, I went out of town.

01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:54.480
This is what happens when I go on vacation.

01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:59.120
So I'll just have to do what everybody else on the internet does and steal them.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:00.080
Hmm.

01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:04.080
Well, yeah, I wouldn't recommend doing that.

01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:07.200
Cause I know, no, I wouldn't, I wouldn't either.

01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:10.320
I want to reward the hardworking developers, but if they're gone, they're gone.

01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:11.280
You know what I mean?

01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:11.520
Yeah.

01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:12.640
Yeah.

01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:19.520
But, um, yeah, it's kind of a shame that the whole thing with the billion Williams went

01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:20.640
down like it did.

01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:21.360
Cause no.

01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:24.560
Well, well, I mean, we'll just, we'll just have to see what's next.

01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:26.560
I mean, there's obviously some type of reason for it.

01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:31.040
So we have to see kind of like, where does the licensing end up going from here?

01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:36.160
You know, is there, or, or is there a reason they pulled it or was it purely financially

01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:36.800
motivated?

01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:41.680
We'll, we'll find out hopefully in the coming year or two as whatever studio maybe has the

01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:47.200
license now announces what they're working on, whether it be a VR thing or who knows?

01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:48.880
It could be a variety of mobile phones.

01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:49.280
Who knows?

01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:50.560
Yeah.

01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:50.960
Yeah.

01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:57.120
I suppose that we could possibly speculate right now as to what the reasons are, but

01:58:57.120 --> 01:59:03.200
it's simply their speculation and it will be a, probably a complete waste of energy

01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:04.000
to do that.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:08.240
But it, you know, like you were saying, you're saying it was kind of a shame, you know, you

01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:13.840
have, you know, you know, got to do everything, got to do lists like that, you know, um, you

01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:20.320
know, cause unfortunately, uh, you know, while I love pinball, um, unfortunately I've been

01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:26.560
focusing more on buying the pinball effects, uh, tables and I kind of figured, you know

01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:33.120
what, the pinball arcade tables will always be around, you know, I'll have full intensive

01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:38.000
purpose, infant male time to buy the table, so I slacked off on buying that.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.920
But I mean, it's not like the pinball effects tables are bad and some of them have like

01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:42.480
licenses.

01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:45.680
They're just, they're just not based on anything in reality.

01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:47.520
But some of those pinball effects tables are great.

01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:50.880
Like some of their star Wars tables are a lot of fun and you know, they, they have the

01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:51.920
cool Marvel tables.

01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:54.160
Didn't pinball effects have the street fighter table too?

01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:54.960
I think they did.

01:59:54.960 --> 02:00:02.560
Oh, so the original game yesterday, in fact, I got the speed fire table on the Xbox live.

02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:09.680
Unfortunately, you know, since, uh, pinball effects never came to steam, as far as I know,

02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:11.840
I, you know, at least not.

02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:14.400
FX3 is on steam.

02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:15.280
I don't know about the original.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:21.600
Yeah, you know, the first two, you know, well, your pinball effects two was on steam is no

02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:22.480
longer on steam.

02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:28.240
Uh, you still have access to, uh, you know, two if you bought, you know, bought content

02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:32.880
for that is, uh, you know, like you said, uh, threes on there as well.

02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:38.960
And virtually all, all, you know, the tables that you bought onto with the exception of

02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:42.080
a handful, like, uh, the, the soccer tables.

02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:47.600
Um, you know, I think, um, the explosion, you know, Miss exposure, man, T1, a couple

02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:51.280
hours didn't make it, uh, get transferred to three.

02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:54.880
But other than that, Eric, if you had on two, you could play on three.

02:00:55.520 --> 02:01:00.320
But yeah, you know, getting back to my initial point before I got some sidetracked, you know,

02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:04.960
first I got behind the evil, you know, what wanted by tables.

02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:08.720
I was only able to buy two, uh, yesterday.

02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:14.160
I managed to get a Jack Bach, you know, about, and the one other one, I forget the name of

02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:19.360
it, but I would have loved to have bought more, but it's not financially feasible this

02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:19.680
month.

02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:23.920
So I kind of like, you know, you snooze, you lose, you know?

02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:24.240
Yeah.

02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:26.000
We can only do what we can do.

02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:30.080
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf is referencing something that came up on his show earlier about the,

02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:31.600
uh, Jack box Royal.

02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:33.120
He talked about this on his show.

02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:37.440
Uh, he would like, and, uh, I guess, I guess I'll say it here, Bobby, since you're convinced

02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:42.400
they still listen to OLR, if anyone at Jack box still does listen to this show, uh, Bobby

02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:46.320
Black Wolf thinks you need to do your own version of one versus 100, and that can be

02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:48.560
your battle Royal game, your Jack box Royal.

02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:53.760
So, uh, take one versus 100, marry it with, you don't know Jack or trivia murder party

02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:58.880
or one of those, uh, at what, why not murder Royal trivia murder Royal, honestly.

02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:01.200
And, uh, yeah, uh, kill a hundred of your friends.

02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:01.840
It'd be fun.

02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:04.240
So, uh, Jack box, we're putting that out there.

02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:04.880
You know what?

02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:06.160
You know what buddies?

02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:07.920
You don't even have to pay us for that idea.

02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:09.680
Just, just having a little shout out in the credits.

02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:10.320
That's all we want.

02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:16.400
Now, now that you brought up, uh, uh, the Jack box, uh, party games.

02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:23.040
Um, and I have a question regarding that and considering that I never played those and

02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:26.000
only played out the, you don't know Jack games.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:33.280
Uh, no, how would you say they compare to, uh, the, uh, Jack box compares to, you don't

02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:38.320
know, uh, Jack, is it better to see, is it like Apple store?

02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:40.240
It's a very similar sense of humor.

02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:45.520
Um, a lot of the Jack box games in those party packs, there's a lot of voting type of games

02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:48.400
where there isn't necessarily a definitive answer.

02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:51.520
Um, it will, you know, prompt you for certain things.

02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:54.960
But that was always like a good part about like board games, like, you know, something

02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:55.760
like Pictionary.

02:02:56.320 --> 02:02:59.520
Pictionary can be serious, but it can also be really funny if you play with a lot of

02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:03.040
like really disgusting people, then they're going to draw everything really perverted

02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:04.160
as all the pictures.

02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:08.000
So that's kind of where Jack box kind of goes is that it gives you just these ideas.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.560
And then ultimately the canvas is your idea.

02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:13.120
There's not a lot that stays on a very linear path.

02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:17.200
Like you don't know, Jack sort of does, except for what comes to mind trivia murder party,

02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:21.280
which was kind of like the, you don't know Jack game that wasn't exactly, you don't know

02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:24.080
Jack, but it was made for mobile phones, that whole sort of thing.

02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:27.760
Uh, so you can see that, but, uh, I would definitely encourage you to watch some Twitch

02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:30.640
streams, um, you know, to get a real sense for what the game is.

02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:35.120
But ultimately I think Jack box is, is a great game for people that like board game night.

02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:39.920
Um, another group of people I've played Jack box games with and had a lot of success is

02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:46.240
that you guys know, I was playing these online, um, survivor type games, uh, a couple months

02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:46.800
ago.

02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:51.040
And, uh, some of the people like when we were doing calls on Skype, the tribe calls, we

02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:54.720
call them somewhat, we just play Jack box games to kind of like bond a little bit.

02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:57.920
Somebody would screen share and we played the Jack box games of the screen sharing.

02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:03.360
And these are people that usually don't play a lot of video games, but surely would still

02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:04.640
play board games and stuff.

02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:08.800
So I think Jack box is great as like digital board games.

02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:10.640
I think is the best way I can put it.

02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:12.960
All right.

02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:18.880
Well, on the final note before I, you know, I'll let you guys go up to take more calls,

02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:24.720
um, on a note tangentially related to video games.

02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:31.840
Uh, if some of you may know, you know, over on GOG, you know, granted they predominantly

02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:33.200
deal in video games.

02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:42.880
They do have a very small, uh, you know, limited quantity of movies for sale.

02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:52.320
One of which I highly recommend is, uh, is actually a concert, uh, put on by, uh, you

02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:59.920
know, the composer of, uh, the whip, the witcher three, uh, wild hunt, uh, you know, where

02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:03.840
they get a concert, you know, it's all kind of festival over in Poland.

02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:04.080
Core.

02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:07.520
It makes total sense because GOG is owned by the same people that made the winter.

02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:09.920
So it makes sense that that's, that's a thing that they're pushing.

02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:10.960
Yeah.

02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:11.280
Yeah.

02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:18.560
And the nice thing is now they give you multiple resolutions in the video, including 4k.

02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:22.960
If you happen to have the setup to play 4k videos.

02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:29.280
So if you like, you know, the witcher series, you'd be like video game music.

02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:36.560
And if you want something to show off your 4k set up by all means, check out the video.

02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:37.600
The music's great.

02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:39.200
The concert's great.

02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:46.240
And, you know, I mean, I've been watching constantly, uh, for the past two, 24 hours

02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:46.640
or so.

02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:49.840
Something to check out.

02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:50.160
All right.

02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:51.760
Anyway, have a nice day.

02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:52.960
You know, take care.

02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:53.440
Take care.

02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:53.600
Bye.

02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:58.320
Uh, and dungeon buster and chat follows up the music for witcher three is really, really

02:05:58.320 --> 02:05:58.560
good.

02:05:58.560 --> 02:05:58.800
Yeah.

02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:02.800
I mean, that whole game was the artist, artistic presentation of that game was so good.

02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:07.200
When I say artistic, I don't just mean graphics, but music is definitely a part of that art.

02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:09.920
Orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:13.280
If anybody else wants to give us a call and, uh, call in.

02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:17.280
So I'm trying to, I'm looking at like some of the websites, uh, with some of the gaming

02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:18.800
news for last minute stories.

02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:24.640
And I still see stories Loki about destiny to still going, I guess the solstice of heroes

02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:29.920
event in a crucible playlist changes are coming in July, July for those that are still grinding

02:06:29.920 --> 02:06:31.040
away on destiny too.

02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:35.520
Although I wonder if there is going to be a destiny three destiny three at this point.

02:06:35.920 --> 02:06:37.200
Anyway, we have another call coming in.

02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:38.240
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

02:06:38.240 --> 02:06:38.960
Who's this?

02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:40.160
Hey, what's going on everyone?

02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:40.960
It's Rama.

02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:41.280
Rama.

02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:43.120
Your mic sucks, but I'll allow it.

02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:44.240
What's up, buddy?

02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:45.280
That's not suck.

02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:47.440
Nobody else has this problem except for you, sir.

02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:49.280
I don't know.

02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:52.240
You're going to hear this back and you're going to be like, something sounds different

02:06:52.240 --> 02:06:53.120
than it used to.

02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:54.160
All right, well, what's up buddy?

02:06:54.720 --> 02:07:01.440
Well, in case you have missed it, we had a mini a couple of weeks ago and saw, and we're

02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:02.960
kind of sad you weren't there for it.

02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:07.440
I saw the pictures of you and, uh, what the hell does he go by now?

02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:10.000
Drew Nami, who was the 23rd magus back in the day?

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:10.240
Yes.

02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:11.280
I saw those pictures.

02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:14.320
I was, uh, I was like, is there a convention going on?

02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:17.840
I wasn't aware of, but no, he was just visiting New York as, as people sometimes do.

02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:18.880
Yeah.

02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:21.440
The funny thing is I had no idea he was in town.

02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:23.360
I had just gotten out of the movies.

02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:24.560
I'm just checking Facebook.

02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:27.360
I'm like, what are you doing here?

02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:28.720
He's at the way station.

02:07:28.720 --> 02:07:32.000
So I'm like, I can be there in 35 minutes.

02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:34.720
And 40 minutes later you made it.

02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:35.360
No, I'm just kidding.

02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:38.560
Actually, you actually pretty much on point with that.

02:07:39.680 --> 02:07:40.960
An accurate read.

02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:41.840
I love it.

02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:46.880
Did any other, uh, OLR listeners, people like SSU 100 Mad I Knows in the area, any of the

02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:49.840
other New York city people, uh, meet up or just.

02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:55.760
No, no, but, uh, JV must have like these monthly raves I keep forgetting to go to.

02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:56.000
So.

02:07:57.360 --> 02:07:58.800
I know I keep seeing the pictures.

02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:01.760
God, I need to get back to New York city so bad.

02:08:01.760 --> 02:08:03.680
I know I've been saying that for like five years, but it's true.

02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:05.680
And Alan's never been, and he really wants to go.

02:08:06.320 --> 02:08:10.000
Um, I know we're eyeing Toronto for a big trip next year, but New York is definitely

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:10.960
on the agenda as well.

02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:15.280
So just if finances work out well, hopefully I can make that happen.

02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:19.760
Three days in New York city, four days in Toronto.

02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:20.560
That's true.

02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:23.280
Make it make a whole travel the world event.

02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:23.760
Who knows?

02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:25.920
I like the sound of that.

02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:26.640
Me too.

02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:30.480
Bobby Blackwell says I've actually never actually been to New York either.

02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:35.040
You know, we just need to find a convention to insert ourselves into and try to do some

02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:35.680
panels.

02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:39.600
Maybe I'll ask around to dragon con, see what they're doing in New York that we may be getting

02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:39.760
on.

02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:46.160
Oh, I know a lot of conventions coming up and I do keep my ear to them.

02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:50.240
I have been recruited to staff a convention in DC and one panel.

02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:51.440
So we'll see how that goes.

02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:51.920
All right.

02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:52.720
Sounds good.

02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:55.920
Well, anything else you want to call it or you want to talk about tonight, my friend?

02:08:55.920 --> 02:08:56.880
Yes, actually.

02:08:56.880 --> 02:09:02.400
Now, has it been a game that you have played somewhere down the line and you really enjoyed

02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:05.840
this game and you say to yourself, I can't believe I slept on this game.

02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:12.880
Um, that's how I felt about mass effects when I finally got into it, honestly, cause I,

02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:17.840
I did sleep on that for many years, uh, and then finally came back and, uh, played it

02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:20.240
later and I was, uh, in love with it.

02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:26.480
Uh, a game that I felt like I slept on and then I finally came back and checked it out

02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:27.600
and I liked it a lot.

02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:28.000
Um,

02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:35.680
there's so many games that I check out right at release.

02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:39.040
It's so hard to go back in the archive and visit old things.

02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:42.960
Loki, is there anything for you like where it's like, oh man, I slept on this.

02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:44.240
I should have had a better eye on it.

02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:49.280
Um, no.

02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:52.080
I mean, I can't think of anything off the top of my head.

02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:54.960
Um, maybe Minecraft a little bit.

02:09:56.720 --> 02:09:57.120
Okay.

02:09:57.120 --> 02:09:58.160
I go with that too.

02:09:58.160 --> 02:09:59.040
Minecraft.

02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:00.960
Like what was the big deal?

02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:03.120
Uh, over in chat at live.vognetwork.com.

02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:05.440
S2 100 Matt says the South Park games.

02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:06.560
It's a pretty good answer too.

02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:08.480
Well, what about you Rama?

02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:09.360
I'm flipping it on you.

02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:10.880
What was the game that you wrote off?

02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:15.760
Ah, okay.

02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:16.260
Okay.

02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:18.080
Ooh, you know what?

02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:24.800
Speaking of like shooty bang bang Pew Pew games, the doom remake would be one where I was like,

02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:28.160
I kind of wrote it off as a shooty Pew Pew game, but it's actually a lot of fun.

02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:29.200
I really liked the doom remake.

02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:34.080
I played that like really couldn't get into it because I felt like the doom remake was

02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:38.640
like a little bit too, uh, high, high, fast paced for me.

02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:40.640
So I couldn't, you know, get into it as well.

02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:43.200
But the old doom games were super fast paced too.

02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:46.720
So anyway, my friend, I'm going to let you go to see if we can squeeze in any more calls,

02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:47.520
but thanks for the call.

02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:48.640
No problem.

02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:49.280
Appreciate it.

02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:49.520
Yep.

02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:50.720
And check the gain on your mic.

02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:51.120
Trust me.

02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:51.360
All right.

02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:51.920
Later buddy.

02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:53.200
All right.

02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:53.700
Bye.

02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:54.640
All right.

02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:55.920
Uh, let's see.

02:10:55.920 --> 02:10:57.680
Oh, dark to see us as Fortnite.

02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:02.000
I didn't think I'd enjoy it, but from playing the switch version, I've been enjoying it.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:02.160
Yeah.

02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:05.200
There's hella people that are checking out Fortnite now for the first time on the switch.

02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:05.700
It's crazy.

02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:08.880
Uh, orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:12.080
We'll try to do like a last minute call for calls.

02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:16.640
Uh, meanwhile, uh, I know a lot of folks are talking about the crew too right now.

02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:18.720
I didn't realize the crew too would just come out.

02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:23.440
Yeah, I think, um, I thought they were doing just like beta testing for that.

02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:29.600
Uh, FIFA 19 is going to be disclosing the odds on the ultimate team packs.

02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:34.080
So you will know what's in those loot boxes or the odds of getting the loot that you want,

02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:38.480
which I think is kind of where the industry is kind of forcing things to go.

02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:40.320
So I guess that's a good thing.

02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:40.720
I don't know.

02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:46.720
Anyway, uh, Bobby Black Wolf says, as far as crew two goes, uh, beta testing was last weekend.

02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:48.480
It came out for realsies this week.

02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:50.320
The beta testing crashed my router.

02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:52.480
So this week I bought a new router.

02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:52.960
Yikes.

02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:54.560
That sounds pretty bad.

02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:56.960
I guess I missed that whole beta test cause I was out of town.

02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:58.000
Pretty good excuse, right?

02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:03.200
Uh, for those of you that are playing Monster Hunter World, there is a Twilight Fest kicking

02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:04.880
off on July 13th.

02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:08.080
You know, they're supposed to be having an event in Final Fantasy 14 around Monster Hunter

02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:10.000
as well, but I haven't heard the details on that yet.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:11.360
So anyway.

02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:12.400
All right.

02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:14.720
Well, sadly, it doesn't look like any more calls are coming in.

02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:18.160
So I think we are going to start to wrap up for the night and I've still got these hiccups

02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:20.800
that are just pissing me off.

02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:24.880
So we're going to go ahead and start to wrap up here, but, uh, as always, we want to thank

02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:26.960
you guys for tuning into Orange Lounge Radio.

02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:30.720
And if you like what you heard here, uh, please, uh, tell a friend about the show because we

02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:32.400
are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:35.840
But, uh, if the voices aren't here to air, we can't air them.

02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:39.280
So, uh, we don't have a big million dollar website behind us or anything like that.

02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:41.360
It's just us homegrown.

02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:43.120
So a word of mouth goes a long way.

02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:47.200
And you know what, even if you tell your friends, you know, what really helps is a nice five

02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:51.840
star review on iTunes or Google podcasts, which I think they, they, they kind of changed

02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:54.480
their podcast app this week.

02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:56.000
So a lot of you guys are checking that out again.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:01.760
So, uh, a nice five star review wherever you found this call or wherever you found this

02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:03.520
show would be welcome.

02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:04.000
Sorry guys.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:07.600
I'm trying to push through these hiccups and like, stop, stop picking me.

02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:08.160
Stop.

02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:08.560
Anyway.

02:13:08.560 --> 02:13:08.880
Yeah.

02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:10.320
Scare those hiccups out of you.

02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:11.040
What?

02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:13.280
Maybe Russia blood blood.

02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:14.160
Hey, Loki.

02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:17.440
I still, I'm still blown away that you got this because I know these things ain't cheap.

02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:18.880
So I hope there was a sale or something.

02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:20.480
So appreciate it very much.

02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:21.520
Assume that there was a sale.

02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:21.760
All right.

02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:22.240
So, all right.

02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:23.280
We'll assume there was a sale.

02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:23.840
All right.

02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:25.920
Uh, thank you guys so much for listening to the show.

02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:28.000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:29.440
Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Yeah.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:35.120
Very tempted to go down to Walmart to pick up a SNES classic.

02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:37.040
Oh, there you go.

02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:38.640
And you get an NES classic while you're at it.

02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:39.600
Cause those are back in stock.

02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:39.760
Yeah.

02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:41.120
But Alan ordered me one.

02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:42.000
It's coming on Friday.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:45.120
If they already, they haven't the Rancho one right now.

02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:45.840
Oh, do they really?

02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:47.680
Oh, he, he, he already mail ordered it.

02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:48.560
So we're just waiting on it.

02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:52.960
So I mean, he didn't know that they were like being reprinted massively.

02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:57.280
So when he saw one at retail price, he was like, I don't know what the fuck's happening,

02:13:57.280 --> 02:13:59.040
but I'm buying one for Rob right now.

02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:03.600
So, which, and I've seen the SNES classics and I've keep like holding off on a bit.

02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:06.320
Like my kids today were looking at like super Nintendo games.

02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:08.160
Look at new Mario game.

02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:10.080
Like, no, that's an old Mario game.

02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:11.280
Look at Toy Story game.

02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:13.120
No, that's an old Toy Story game.

02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:15.760
So I'm like, you know, I could just get one of these.

02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:18.880
You and I have a raspberry PI, you know, I could really just do a raspberry pilot.

02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:23.120
I liked the controller and that's the other thing.

02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:28.000
She was like, I would get an NES classic, but I can just fucking mod the SNES classic

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.280
to put the NES games on there.

02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:30.720
So there's really no point.

02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:31.840
All right.

02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:33.600
So I'm trying to do that.

02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:39.200
And my final thought is I get to play Tetris attack in VR and I'm or Tetris effect in VR.

02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:42.080
And I'm so happy in a few months, in a few months.

02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:43.840
Yeah, I don't get to do it tonight, but in a few months.

02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:45.600
So in the meantime, I have rez.

02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:50.000
I have until dawn rush of blood and I have Skyrim VR, which I really want to check out

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:50.640
because I hope I can.

02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:51.920
I still haven't checked it out yet.

02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:53.600
I bought it, but I haven't played it yet.

02:14:54.880 --> 02:14:56.960
But it'll be interesting.

02:14:56.960 --> 02:15:00.400
I don't know if that's necessarily the best VR game, but it's Skyrim.

02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:00.880
It's fun.

02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:02.000
All right.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:02.640
But check out.

02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:07.280
Yeah, the demo disc and definitely like Job Simulator.

02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:08.880
Those are pretty fun, of course.

02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:10.560
Or actually Job Simulator.

02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:14.000
It can get a little boring because it's a little kitty, but like accounting plus.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:14.560
All right.

02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:16.160
Or I want to try.

02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:16.880
I just picked it up.

02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:20.320
I want to really want to try just in time make because that looks hilarious.

02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:22.320
It's overly violent, but cute.

02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:26.080
And so like they have like scenarios.

02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:28.960
Like, for example, there's one that there's a grandma in the middle.

02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:32.720
She's like with her walker and stuff, and there's a whole bunch of knife wielding murderers

02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:33.920
are trying to kill her.

02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:37.600
And you have to kill them while everything's moving slow.

02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:38.720
And it's hilarious.

02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:39.200
All right.

02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:43.520
I have to get on the PlayStation store and check out all these games that they have now

02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:44.320
that I can actually play.

02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:45.360
All right.

02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:46.560
That's going to do it for another episode.

02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:47.280
Orange, Andrea.

02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:49.200
My other final thought is fuck hiccups.

02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:50.640
This is the worst thing in the world.

02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:52.640
We'll be back in seven days to do it all over again.

02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:57.440
Hopefully with less hiccups and more gaming news and more of you guys live and on our

02:15:57.440 --> 02:15:58.240
