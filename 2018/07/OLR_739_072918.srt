00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,720
In the year of the remaster I was pleasantly surprised to see Turok released on Steam and

2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,920
now the same company is bringing the N64 release of Forsaken back to PC and the Xbox One as

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,920
well.

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,800
Engage your six degrees of freedom and join us for another episode of the show where every

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,800
gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,880
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,880
Welcome back.

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,040
It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:45,760
It's Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 739 for this July 29th of 2018.

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,520
Oh my gosh, I can't believe August is almost here and then that means fall is around the

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,400
corner and all the holiday games are around the corner.

12
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
Crazy time.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,960
Anyway, I am Rob Roberts here to talk about video games and gaming culture, the gaming

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,800
lifestyle with you here on the show with my co-hosts.

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,600
Say hello as always to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Hi.

17
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Hi, how are you?

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
I'm okay.

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
Yeah?

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
You were coming through quiet there for a minute.

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
Yeah.

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
We're good.

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,600
We're good.

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Yesterday was a busy day.

25
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,600
Yeah?

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,600
Well, you went to California Stream, right?

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,600
I did.

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,600
You want to tell us a little bit about that?

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,600
There were lots of video games, lots of noise.

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
Yeah.

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,280
Lots of lights, lots of headaches, which I still have a bit of one today, but I had

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,280
a great time.

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,760
I played a bunch of stuff and I'll talk about it when I talk about what I played, but there

34
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,200
was a bit of a rarity there and that was a pop-in stage.

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,400
Oh, is that the dancing thing?

36
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,880
Yes, it is completely non-intuitive.

37
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,160
Huh.

38
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,960
I did not enjoy it.

39
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,960
I don't think I've ever played that.

40
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,560
I didn't even know they had one of those in the Bay Area.

41
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
I love theater.

42
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,160
That's kind of a newer game for California Extreme to have.

43
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,160
You know what I mean?

44
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,680
Yeah, it was really fun, but only like two songs that was kind of, I'm glad I didn't

45
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
pay for it.

46
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
Yeah.

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,240
But I'll talk more about that in my gaming week.

48
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,240
Sounds good.

49
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,920
So for those that don't know, if you've never heard of it, California Stream is a big thing

50
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,960
that they have here in the Bay Area where they basically fill a ballroom at a hotel

51
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,840
with, it's supposed to be classic arcade games, but it sounds like they put a lot of contemporary

52
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
stuff in there too.

53
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
Especially-

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
Oh, it's all across the spectrum.

55
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,920
And old and new pinball because they had the Iron Maiden machines out.

56
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,000
Because didn't it start as a pinball thing and then kind of grew into this other stuff

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
too?

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't know.

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's been a long time.

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So, huh.

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
All right.

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Interesting.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Anyhow, I'm also joining us in studio.

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,560
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

65
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,560
Hello.

66
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,560
How are you?

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,560
I'm good.

68
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
You were playing with wires down there.

69
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,560
Everything okay?

70
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,800
Well, yeah, because my laptop said it wasn't charging.

71
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
I was like, oh, that's not good.

72
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
That's weird.

73
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
It's plugged in.

74
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
You're going to need that.

75
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,020
So apparently a cord is loose.

76
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,680
No California Stream for you, sadly.

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
No.

78
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,400
I could have gone, but I had a big show last night.

79
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,460
The clue on stage that I talked about a few previous weeks happened last night.

80
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,660
So my week was obviously very busy preparing for that.

81
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,440
And today I'm just in like, I left the house once.

82
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,640
I left the house once today to walk up the street to go raid an Alola Marowak.

83
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,720
That's the only time I've left the house today.

84
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,080
And probably will be the only time I leave the house today.

85
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
So anyway.

86
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,680
But I would have loved to have gone to California Stream, except that it's always inevitably

87
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,480
on some weekend where I have something else going on.

88
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
Summer's a busy time.

89
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,480
What can I say?

90
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,040
I didn't even know it was this weekend.

91
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Yeah.

92
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
Like it snuck up on me.

93
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,280
I got a text from our buddy Melody just out of the blue.

94
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,240
Like that was like, are you coming to California Stream?

95
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,840
And I was, I think it was something like that.

96
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,600
And I was like, oh, well, no clue is also tomorrow.

97
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,840
So, and I was like, dang, I didn't even realize it was this weekend.

98
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
Oh, well.

99
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,680
I'm glad to hear it was a good show at least.

100
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,320
And that fun was had by some people.

101
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,280
It was good.

102
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
Anyway.

103
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,600
Um, so any exciting stuff going on in your week, Loki?

104
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,840
Um, no, not really.

105
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,240
I mean, just still working on unreal programming.

106
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
Okay.

107
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Sticking with that.

108
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
Been doing at least like a few hours a day.

109
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,480
I saw some of your tweets that you're really liking some of like the, I guess, like templates

110
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,480
and stuff that they do.

111
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,960
Well, it's just like they have the way the engine's built because I mean, it's unreal

112
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
engine.

113
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,400
And you can use it for first person shooters.

114
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,160
I mean, that's what they built it on.

115
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,120
And so of course they have a lot of stuff built for shooter games.

116
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,920
And so they have a lot of these things you would normally have to make all the time,

117
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,160
like projectile scripts and stuff for different types of cameras for third person, you know,

118
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,840
shooter cameras or first person shooter cameras.

119
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,200
They have a lot of that built in them.

120
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,800
Unity has some of that too, but I don't know, I kind of like the way that they set this

121
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
up a little bit.

122
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,600
And the hang of blueprints and kind of figuring out how that translates into normal code.

123
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,320
Because there's a whole lot of like, I'm going to have to go through after I'm done with

124
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,840
this, I'm going to have to go through a bunch of different blueprint courses that kind of

125
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,600
learn all of the ins and outs of what it can do.

126
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,840
Because there's a lot of features there, but I like it and I like how it makes everything

127
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,560
easy to make look good, I guess.

128
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,120
All right, cool.

129
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,720
So does this mean your game is a first person shooter that you're making?

130
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
No.

131
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,360
I thought we thought we might have got some confirmation in there.

132
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
I tried you guys.

133
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,100
Anyway, let's go to our chat.

134
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,160
Say hello to our chatters.

135
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,880
We do, of course, tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,

136
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,920
vognetwork.com, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf

137
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
show.

138
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,920
And you can chat along with us at live.vognetwork.com, where actf says Alola Marowak was worth it.

139
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,120
I never thought I would be so excited to catch a Marowak, because I don't know about you

140
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,880
guys, but like Cubones are like herpes here.

141
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,020
They're everywhere, right?

142
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,140
So I have tons of regular Marowaks, but the Alola Marowak is so cool with like the fire

143
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,140
thing.

144
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,540
And the only way you can get them right now is in raids.

145
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,060
They didn't even put them in the eggs.

146
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,320
So yeah, it was kind of worth it actually, even though it didn't end up highest appraisal.

147
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,880
But I mean, how often do you actually battle with Marowak?

148
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,880
Probably not very often.

149
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,520
Sometimes, sometimes it's about putting cool stuff in gyms though, because I was able to

150
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:18,880
get a Torque Hole from Shane, who is at the actual Go Fest or whatever they call it in

151
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,680
Chicago, where they had a ton of them.

152
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,320
So he brought me back a Torque Hole.

153
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,800
So I just started putting Torque Hole in gyms around here, just so that people could get

154
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,840
the Dex entry if they didn't already have it.

155
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,680
So you know, kind of fun, even though they don't get the full, full entry without actually

156
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,880
capturing a Torque Hole.

157
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,840
So hopefully there'll be more opportunities to catch some of those things that are typically

158
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,840
region locked.

159
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,600
I know the only things I need now are region locked Mr. Mime and Kangaskhan.

160
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
That's all I need.

161
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,840
So I'm going to hope that maybe I can get some at Dragon Con because people come from

162
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,520
all around the world to Dragon Con.

163
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,160
So I'm hoping there'll be like a trading outpost or something where like maybe I could trade

164
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,960
some Tauros, which is the exclusive here.

165
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,760
But here's the other funny thing.

166
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,120
I didn't mean to make this a Pokemon Go podcast, but deal with it.

167
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,600
A lot of people were playing.

168
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,920
On my flight back from Dragon Con this year, I go to the Austin airport and I believe Austin

169
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,600
is far enough South where I can get Corrosola, I think.

170
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,240
So I'm going to try to get one at the airport because I think I have a layover of like 90

171
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,240
minutes.

172
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
So everybody cross your fingers.

173
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,920
Although I think, I think technically I think JD actually, when he was in Florida, brought

174
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,000
back some stuff to trade, but it would be cool to catch one of my own and then I could

175
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,280
get more to bring back to trade for some of the other people around here.

176
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
So we'll see.

177
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,280
We'll see.

178
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
Anyway.

179
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,920
Um, other comments and chat over at live.vognover.com.

180
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
Okay.

181
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,960
One more Pokemon comment here from SSG100Matt, who says I've not gotten a chance to get an

182
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Alolan Marowak.

183
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,880
I did get an Alolan Raichu.

184
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,760
It doesn't seem like the Marowak spawn very often, um, but, and you need, you need a group

185
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,920
to do Marowak.

186
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,280
You can solo Raichu if you're a higher level.

187
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,400
I soloed it, but I only had like 12 seconds left on the clock.

188
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,300
Uh, but I just used like the recommended Pokemon too, which aren't always the best.

189
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,580
The recommended are usually more better defenders than attackers, but, um, I only, I did it

190
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,580
with weather boost.

191
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,700
I had like 12 seconds left, but I do, I was able to solo it.

192
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:14,420
So you can solo Alolan Raichu, but if you can duo it for the insurance, it's probably

193
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,700
a lot easier.

194
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,700
All right.

195
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,180
Anyway, uh, let's move on and talk about something that's an, I do love Pokemon Go, but I'm sure

196
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,020
it's going to come up in gaming weeks too.

197
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,540
Let's talk about some other games and a little story to kick us off.

198
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,740
Uh, because we like it when video games, I don't know about you guys, but I like when

199
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,700
I see video games represented kind of like in the mainstream stuff.

200
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,660
Like not that, I don't think gaming necessarily needs that validation at this point because

201
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,300
I know we've talked about it before.

202
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:45,400
I think as you know, our generation is getting older, that sort of that, I really don't like

203
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,500
to use the term Zillennial, but you know what I'm talking about?

204
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,060
Like kind of that window right between generation X and millennial, right?

205
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,060
Kind of like as that generation is getting older, like we all know video games.

206
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,460
Like even if like you had friends that play video games or you know, people do video games.

207
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,780
So it's not that we necessarily need the validation, but it's still kind of cool to see stuff on

208
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,500
mainstream TV.

209
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:14,200
So for example, uh, the Overwatch league had their finals on and we, we talked about this

210
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,620
last week show, but the finals really were on ESPN, uh, this weekend and the London Spitfire

211
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,620
won the whole thing.

212
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,660
Um, and I know some people were really into that watching it.

213
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,980
They had it at a huge arena, the Barclays arena.

214
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,940
So they did it at a like more like an arena that would typically have like basketball

215
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,940
and stuff.

216
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,060
Um, instead of the custom one, that's basically a TV studio that Blizzard built, I'm a little

217
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,420
closer to their home.

218
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,620
So I mean, it's pretty cool to see that kind of validation.

219
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,380
Um, but then this one, in my opinion, kind of came out of nowhere.

220
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,540
Somebody tweeted this at me because I don't, I don't always watch this show, but, um, you

221
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,060
guys ever watched America's Got Talent, that show it's been on for years now.

222
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,700
It's on like it's 13 season or something.

223
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,700
I don't know what you're talking.

224
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,700
No.

225
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,700
Yes.

226
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,700
I've seen a show.

227
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,700
Well, here's my, okay.

228
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,020
I don't really watch America's Got Talent, but those videos from all those guys, cause

229
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,740
no matter what country you live in, they have one of these shows, they have the Britain's

230
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,740
Got Talent.

231
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,740
They have, they have everything.

232
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,100
Everybody's got talent, which is a talent filled world, right?

233
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,080
So everybody has talent and nobody has talent.

234
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,460
So these, these talent things show up all the time on Facebook because it will be like,

235
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,700
look at this 11 year old girl that sings opera.

236
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,700
So beautiful.

237
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,900
Make you cry or look at this girl who plays the ukulele.

238
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,940
She's so, you know, she's got a story that will break your heart and check out this eight

239
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,500
year old boy that's singing a song about his mom who's dying of cancer and like all these

240
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,040
like, like it's emotional porn.

241
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,940
That show is emotional pornography.

242
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,660
It's Facebook.

243
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,660
It's forward.

244
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,660
Garbage.

245
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,660
It is.

246
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,660
It is.

247
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,220
But it's totally like, and I eat it up like, you know, just like, you know, sometimes you

248
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:54,680
want real pornography for reasons, so I'm going to say sometimes you want emotional

249
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,020
pornography because I just want to cry.

250
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:03,020
I need, I need to have a good cry, so I'm going to watch some emotional pornography.

251
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,020
What Loki?

252
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,460
You don't, you don't fall down the well of emotional pornography ever.

253
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,580
No, no, it's just, it's dark soccer.

254
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,380
Well of regular pornography.

255
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,380
Where are these wells filled with pornography?

256
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,300
This is, well Facebook has, and then the other one, well of garbage.

257
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:24,380
That's like, that's like I'm dumping a drip, jumping into the dumpster there.

258
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:29,220
A porn hub would be the other, I suppose, I guess a dark, dark soccer.

259
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,500
Do you ever, do you ever sit there for hours and hours and watch emotional pornography?

260
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
No.

261
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,500
No.

262
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
What is it?

263
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Just me.

264
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Chad.

265
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
I do.

266
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,500
I do watch animal cops.

267
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
Houston.

268
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Okay.

269
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Okay.

270
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,660
So cute cat videos can totally be emotional pornography.

271
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,380
Like if you just want to sit there and watch cute cat videos for an hour, that's totally

272
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,380
emotional porn.

273
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,900
It's just a different, it's just a different type.

274
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,100
Just like real pornography, many different types.

275
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,380
Okay.

276
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:04,220
So anyway, on my favorite emotional porn show this week, uh, we had a choir that was on

277
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,220
performing.

278
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,140
It was the Angel City Choral, I think is the name of their group and they are from the

279
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,140
Los Angeles area.

280
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,780
And the big thing is that they're a very diverse group of people.

281
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:19,700
You know, you've got all sorts of diversity when it comes to races, ethnicity, sexuality,

282
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,300
age, like, you know, political leanings and all that stuff.

283
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,300
That's kind of like their big thing.

284
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,740
They all come together to sing.

285
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,880
Well, they already got through on the first, so I guess the way the show works, there's

286
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,600
like the auditions, right?

287
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,780
So they got through on the auditions with their rendition of, I kid you not, Toto's

288
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:43,060
Africa, which I know that song is all the rage right now, but they legit did that song

289
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,060
and it was really good.

290
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,860
Like I saw that one too on one of my emotional porn binges and they did a really good job

291
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,860
on that.

292
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,420
Well, they were back this week for, I guess the judges cut as they try to narrow it down,

293
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,580
I think to like the top 32 or something.

294
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:00,940
So during the judges cut, they sang this one, which some of you gamers, especially the one

295
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,860
that listened to this show might recognize.

296
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:15,980
Do you recognize this at all?

297
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,140
Yeah, I've played it on OLR before.

298
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:24,860
We actually had the guy who made this song on OLR some time ago.

299
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,060
It's Baba Yetu from Civilization IV.

300
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:33,060
It's the epic title opening sequence, which went on to be the first gaming song that got

301
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,060
a Grammy.

302
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,860
Well, I didn't realize this, but apparently that song, maybe because of the fact that

303
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,920
it won the Grammy, it's become kind of like one of the standards.

304
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,860
There's many high schools and so forth that do adaptations of this and well deserved on

305
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,860
Christopher Tin.

306
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,860
It's a great song.

307
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,520
I think most people that have heard this love this song.

308
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,980
And I would say, again, if you like this song, you need to go look up the song he did in

309
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,600
Civilization VI, the Dream of Flight.

310
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,800
I can't remember.

311
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,100
It's in Italian, but it translates to Dream of Flight.

312
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,100
That song is amazing too.

313
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,660
But anyway, Baba Yetu, which is Swahili, if I remember right, for the Lord's Prayer.

314
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,460
That's the song that was on America's Got Talent.

315
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,420
This is kind of an interesting twist though.

316
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:18,200
So the way it works, I guess they do like 12 acts in an episode and there's a guest

317
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,140
judge there every week because there's like the regular judges like Heidi Klum and Scary

318
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,940
Spice, like the regular judges.

319
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,900
But then there's a guest judge every week and the guest judge can press the golden buzzer

320
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,900
for one act.

321
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,080
Well, the golden busser was press on these guys because it was a really good performance

322
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,880
if you haven't watched it already yet.

323
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,260
But it was pressed by Olivia Munn, which I thought was kind of interesting.

324
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,620
So that was pretty cool.

325
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:46,500
I wonder if she recognized the song because she's a bit of a gamer, right?

326
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Probably.

327
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Yeah.

328
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
So wasn't she on Attack of the Show for a short while?

329
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,500
If I remember right.

330
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,500
Yeah.

331
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
So kind of interesting.

332
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,460
Anyhow, so they moved on with that.

333
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,740
Sadly, I don't think I saw the name of the song get checked.

334
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,340
I don't think I heard Christopher Tin get name checked or anything like that, but it

335
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:08,460
was still one of those moments of, wait a minute, I know this because of a video game.

336
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,340
So it's kind of curious, like if you guys have had any moments, I'll open this up to

337
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,340
chat as well.

338
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,340
I don't know.

339
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,580
And I know I'm springing this on you guys in studio, but maybe you have something that

340
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,980
jumps off top of your head.

341
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:23,260
Do you have any moments where you've seen like video gaming get represented in a mainstream

342
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,900
culture and you're like, oh, I know that because I'm a gamer.

343
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,780
Have you ever kind of like had that?

344
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:35,180
I mean, Loki, I imagine like the movie Ready Player One was nothing but that.

345
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:40,300
So I'm not sure that's the best place to start, but I guess it was a Spielberg movies.

346
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:46,100
I love calling out what games people are playing on TV dramas.

347
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,660
Like what they're playing on, like, you know, older systems and stuff like that, for example,

348
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,380
house to my wife's displeased.

349
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,780
She's very displeased when I do that, when they think, oh, that's GTA.

350
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,180
Oh, hey, that's Spider-Man.

351
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,620
Oh, hey, that's this.

352
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,300
When they're playing Call of Duty, but it has Atari 2600 noises.

353
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,300
That's right.

354
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,940
He had like a PSP that he got in in one of them, because, you know, Sony tie in probably.

355
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,300
So like I kept calling it.

356
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,300
I'm like, yeah, it's a PSP.

357
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
She's like, just stop.

358
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,300
Don't do that.

359
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,500
Jamie, anything that jumps in your mind?

360
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,180
Like I know you don't watch a ton of television, but Ralph, what's OK.

361
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,180
OK.

362
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,180
I like that.

363
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,500
Disney hopping on it.

364
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
Yeah.

365
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Disney embracing the gaming culture.

366
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,580
That's a good answer, too.

367
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,220
And I think that's something where gaming culture has kind of embraced it back.

368
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,420
And you know, we're getting a Wreck-It Ralph, too.

369
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,220
And yeah, I think a lot of people watch Wreck-It Ralph to try to catch all the little subtle

370
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,220
references.

371
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,220
That shitty Pixels movie.

372
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:44,940
I mean, that was definitely a mainstream attempt to capture.

373
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,140
Attempt is a good word.

374
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,500
There was an attempt, Jamie.

375
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,540
There was an attempt.

376
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,540
My point is just that even, you know, there's that attempt.

377
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:01,820
So yeah, looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Tiger Claw says most would know Olivia Munn

378
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,060
as Psylocke in X-Men Apocalypse.

379
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:10,300
I believe if I'm not mistaken, she was also the I always get the two Olivia's confused.

380
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,300
She's not.

381
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,580
She's not the one in Tron Legacy.

382
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,180
That's the that's a different Olivia.

383
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,620
Oh, it's the different.

384
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,620
It's the other one.

385
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,620
Olivia Wilde.

386
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,620
Olivia Wilde is.

387
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,620
Yeah.

388
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:24,100
So no, Olivia Munn was the girlfriend in Magic Mike.

389
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:28,380
I don't know why my mind goes to Magic Mike, but there you go.

390
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,980
Probably because of that porn well that you're talking about.

391
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,100
Anyway, how dare you?

392
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,900
Bobby Blackwolf points out the MLB All-Star game had a segment about Fortnite and the

393
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,980
players favorite dances.

394
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,980
Dang.

395
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,300
Fortnite is like that game that everybody is freaking.

396
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,140
It's like the Minecraft, I guess, of of 2018.

397
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,040
Bobby Blackwolf also points out Baba Yetu is now the number three downloaded classical

398
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,540
song on iTunes this week.

399
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,540
So it got around.

400
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,540
You're right.

401
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,500
Probably, you know, it was probably labeled with it as that video was circulating the

402
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,540
emotional porn circuit.

403
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,740
So yeah, I'm sure Baba Yetu got a nice little bounce thanks to that mainstream exposure.

404
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,580
And that's part of why, like, even if you're the type where you're like, who cares about

405
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,580
the mainstream?

406
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,220
I like to go against the mainstream.

407
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,220
That's fine.

408
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:21,100
But realize that, you know, that that exposure in the mainstream still goes a long way for

409
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,060
getting coined for these people like Christopher Ten that, you know, created these songs and

410
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,060
so forth.

411
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,100
So let's see other stuff.

412
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,660
Oh, yeah.

413
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,940
Kaijuto says I saw Mario Brothers represented on Dancing with the Stars.

414
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,940
I remember that was recently.

415
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,220
That was a couple of years like in the past year or two.

416
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,220
I remember seeing that, too.

417
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,220
That's pretty funny.

418
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,020
Yeah, but I don't like to include where it's represented in that cringe.

419
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,620
That's true.

420
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,300
Let's see.

421
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,020
Bobby Blocko says seeing Will Wright interviewed on Colbert Report.

422
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,020
Yeah.

423
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,780
Speaking of late night TV, late night TV has been embraced that more and more.

424
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,380
I know Jimmy Fallon because there's Jimmy Fallon likes games anyway.

425
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,380
Yeah.

426
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,380
There's two Olivia's and there's two Jimmy's.

427
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,780
Also Jimmy Kimmel.

428
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,980
Jimmy Fallon had Reggie on.

429
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,200
Remember when the switch was coming out and there was that infamous thing with Miyamoto

430
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,540
in the audience with like the thumbs down and turning to the thumbs up.

431
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,180
That was from Jimmy Kimmel or Jimmy.

432
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,180
God damn it.

433
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,180
Jimmy Fallon.

434
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,820
Remember, Fallon's the one that lasted himself.

435
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,820
All right.

436
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,820
Just like me.

437
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,820
No, it's all right.

438
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,820
It's funny.

439
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:26,380
I couldn't stand Fallon in SNL, but when he hit late night, it was actually much better.

440
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:31,820
Act Deft says not sure if related, but there was a national TV channel in Mexico that used

441
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,980
don't know if they still do music from many video games in their news segments.

442
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,860
There would be stuff from Silent Hill even in some of those.

443
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,500
Why do you have Silent Hill music on the news?

444
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:50,420
Like that's kind of today we opened up a new, that's what I feel about American news.

445
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,420
I hate that.

446
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,420
I'm laughing at that, but it's true.

447
00:19:52,420 --> 00:20:00,940
We've opened up a new mall, Silent Hill music, free puppies, you know, uh, guys, you know,

448
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,100
pointing out rocket league was on blackish, uh, that I've heard a lot of good things about

449
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,100
that show.

450
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,940
I haven't seen it myself yet, but I know that's on ABC and does very well.

451
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,340
Uh, Bob Coffey kind of piggybacking on the Mexico thing saying Japan does that with news

452
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:18,780
sometimes and probably because, um, you know, video gaming probably got embedded in mainstream

453
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,500
Japanese culture before it really got embedded in ours.

454
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,180
Anyway, those are some good answers.

455
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,180
You guys.

456
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,180
Thank you.

457
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:30,380
I like, you know, I like seeing these games like, Oh, you know, it shows up somewhere.

458
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,380
It's pretty cool.

459
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,860
Anyway, let's talk a little bit about some games that we saw this week and talk a little

460
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,500
bit about our gaming weeks.

461
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:41,260
So dark soccer, I know, I'm sure you got tons of classic games to talk about.

462
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,260
Yeah.

463
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,260
I have to pull out the list.

464
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,260
All right.

465
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,260
It's a three hour show.

466
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,260
Jamie.

467
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,060
Well, I, I, I was lately, it's only been two.

468
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,580
I was pretty, um, particular about what I played.

469
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:58,580
So in, um, so played Beatmania three, the final, which of course, but then I got mad

470
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,880
at Dan cause he, he tried to join in with me, which of course put it in co-op mode,

471
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,820
which I hate about five key.

472
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,820
Yeah.

473
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,380
And then doesn't like, you only play like alternating notes or something.

474
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,380
Yeah.

475
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,900
So, or parts of different parts of the song.

476
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,180
So I just waited for it to fail us so I could play by myself again.

477
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:20,140
And then, uh, Ray crisis, they had a bunch of candy cabs, you know, the Japanese cabinets.

478
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,980
So it played, um, Ray crisis, which was a lot of fun.

479
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:28,700
Um, then we went upstairs to the console room and played streets of rage to win a Sega Genesis,

480
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:34,300
which was pretty fun to, um, pop and stage, which I did have to give it a try and decided

481
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,300
it's not for me.

482
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,220
It just is not intuitive to play.

483
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,940
And then it played theaters, um, uh, final fantasy all star carnival, which was super

484
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,940
fun.

485
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:48,260
I love theater them in the arcade, then, uh, riding DX, which is one of my favorite shooters

486
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:55,740
like ever because of the purple Rappy laser, um, played donkey Kong on a, uh, uh, sit down

487
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:02,620
table and I hate the controller on it because it's, um, it's coming out horizontally instead

488
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,260
of on a little shelf vertically.

489
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,140
So I really don't like it.

490
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:13,100
Um, I played another game called Mamoru Koon curse, which is like a running shooter and

491
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,300
slightly bullet hellish, but it was really a fun game.

492
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:23,140
Um, I played another real bullet hell game that I completely bombed at called AKA V blue.

493
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,540
Um, it was, it was pretty fun.

494
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,540
Very pretty.

495
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,220
I like the shell, the cell shaded style of it.

496
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,220
Oh yeah.

497
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,220
I love that game.

498
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,220
Yeah.

499
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,260
It was, uh, it was on the, um, the dreamcast hardware.

500
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,780
I forget the Naomi hardware, I think.

501
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,340
I think it's newer than that.

502
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,340
No, you're right.

503
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,380
It's, uh, it's much newer than that.

504
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,380
I can't remember.

505
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:51,260
Was it, is it dolphin blue is what that was or cause I think that's what it is in English.

506
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,220
No, it's basically red versus blue.

507
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,220
AKA is red.

508
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,220
Hmm.

509
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:00,420
Maybe I think I'll send you a picture of, of what it looked like, but it was, it was

510
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,620
pretty good.

511
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,620
Pretty good shooter.

512
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,460
Um, it was just really tough.

513
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:10,460
Um, I played, um, they had a dragon ball fighter Z, um, arcade set up, although it was the

514
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,060
console version with arcade cabinet stuff.

515
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,540
So it was fun.

516
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,800
These two guys were just like continuing over and over and over.

517
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:24,760
So I made a very salty, gee, it would be nice if other people get to play and they both

518
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,300
looked chagrined and you know, eventually got up.

519
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,500
Um, I played another game.

520
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:35,460
Well, before that I played dual Donpach, which of course, you know, fun game.

521
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,020
It's on, it's got an iOS release too, although it's still expensive.

522
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,020
Really?

523
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,020
Hmm.

524
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,020
That's a fun thing.

525
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,020
Donpach like the thing.

526
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,400
Um, I played music gun gun.

527
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,500
Have you seen that one?

528
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,540
Uh, is that the one that's like gigantic?

529
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,540
It's like a gigantic machine.

530
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,700
I think I've seen it around one where you have like the gun, you shoot in the rhythm.

531
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,700
Yeah.

532
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,700
That game is interesting.

533
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,700
That game was pretty fun.

534
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,980
Um, I played the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

535
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,980
It's no point blank.

536
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,980
No, but it's really fun.

537
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,980
Okay.

538
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,980
But I played the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the one based off of the CG.

539
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,980
Wake up, Tigerclaw.

540
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,980
Wake up.

541
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,260
The one based off the CG, you know, kids show version.

542
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:16,780
Melody and I took turns on that one because, um, they were on the final boss rush.

543
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,780
Oh.

544
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,380
And I got a little bit tired, so she took over playing Raphael.

545
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,380
It was pretty fun.

546
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,380
That's cool.

547
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,380
Yeah.

548
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,380
It's a neat game.

549
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,500
Did it kind of remind you of the old one?

550
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,500
Yeah.

551
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,300
But, man, Raphael has no freaking range.

552
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,900
Um, but he did still have like the slam back and forth move.

553
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,900
That one was pretty fun.

554
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,500
Um, then I played, uh, God Plus, which I'm probably going to do that as a classic game

555
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,500
at some point.

556
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,700
God Plus, for those who don't know, is, um, Galaga 3.

557
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,060
It was renamed as Galaga 3 because people didn't realize that God Plus was the same

558
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:51,700
one, which the funny thing about it is you can get this little weapon if you shoot a

559
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:57,580
particular enemy that gives you like a vacuum funnel and you can absorb some of the enemies

560
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:02,020
and then they become shooter options until they get hit.

561
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,020
It's pretty neat.

562
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:09,020
Um, then I played Rhythm Tengoku, um, which was, you know, Rhythm Heaven, for those who

563
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,420
don't know what Tengoku means by this point.

564
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,420
Um, Steel Chronicle Vic Troopers, that was another neat game.

565
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:22,660
Um, basically, it's, uh, behind the, uh, the mech that you're playing, but you have, um,

566
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,660
different controls.

567
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,660
Like, you have one that controls, like, camera angle and the other one that controls your

568
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,140
movement with different, uh, guns and bombs and things.

569
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,660
It was a pretty neat, neat little battle game.

570
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:37,500
Um, I played, the only pinball I played was Hyper Ball, which doesn't really pinball,

571
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,880
to be honest.

572
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
And then I played...

573
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,300
I was about to ask why you didn't play more pinball, but then I'm like, oh yeah, she can

574
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,940
kind of play, like, a lot of pinball at home whenever she wants.

575
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,140
Yeah, that's really the truth.

576
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,660
Um, then I played Mushihime Tama, which isn't Mushihime Sama, it's Mushihime Tama, where

577
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:57,500
you play the character from Mushihime Sama on a little, like, bubble game.

578
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:05,260
Kind of a little bit of Puyo Puyo meets, um, I don't know, it's just like you have to drop

579
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:09,980
these blobs on the same color and you have, like, an arc, so you either have to do up

580
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:15,780
left or down right to control how your bubbles are going to throw.

581
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:24,340
You control the arc of it, so maybe a little bit of Angry Birds meets Puyo Puyo and how

582
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,340
you have to control it.

583
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:30,820
It was a neat little game, I got decently through it, and that was all I played.

584
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,820
Alright!

585
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,420
Sounds like you still had a very busy day.

586
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,340
I had a very busy day, and I bought games.

587
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,340
Oh, did you?

588
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,540
Dan and I bought some stuff.

589
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,540
Yeah, anything a note, real quick?

590
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,540
Um, yes.

591
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,540
Like, all of it?

592
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,780
I bought myself a copy of Dance Summit, because I'm going to give Shane back his as soon as

593
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,780
I find it.

594
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,780
Oh, cool!

595
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,780
Um, 20 bucks, but not bad.

596
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,780
That's not bad, no, for that?

597
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:57,300
No, um, I like to buy from Tiny Potato when I'm there.

598
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:04,500
Their prices are, I'm not going to, they're fair for what they're selling, but they do

599
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,500
know the value of their stuff.

600
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,500
Sure.

601
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,500
And they're great guys.

602
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,060
For those that don't know, Dance Summit is bust a move slash groove three.

603
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,060
Yeah, essentially.

604
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,060
Basically, yeah.

605
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,780
It's like the multi-player team dance.

606
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,780
Yep.

607
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:24,460
Um, and then, um, Dan bought Shantae for, um, uh, Wii U.

608
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,460
Oh, random!

609
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:32,780
And, well, Wii One, I already had it on Switch, not on Switch, but on, um, Steam.

610
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,820
And then, um, he bought Bayonetta 2 for Wii U.

611
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,820
Nice.

612
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,820
Which comes with Bayonetta 1.

613
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,140
And I was like, you know, that's on Switch, right?

614
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,140
He's like, it is?

615
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,140
Yeah.

616
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:45,940
He's like, I was like, yeah, but we now have it for Wii U, so whatevs.

617
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:50,660
Well, yeah, and now that the Wii U is kind of like, I wouldn't say it's completely sunsetted

618
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:55,220
yet, but like, we're like two minutes to midnight on the Wii U here, like it's, it's pretty

619
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,220
much done.

620
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,260
And, uh, you know, that, I think it's going to be the value of things like that kind of

621
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,260
go up.

622
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,260
You know what I mean?

623
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,260
It's collector's items.

624
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,660
Well, and then I bought him something that he told me not to buy him, but I know he wanted

625
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:09,280
it and he doesn't know I bought it for him, so he's, I left it on the bottom of the stack

626
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,280
of games on the table.

627
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,280
Oh.

628
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:17,580
I bought him the Sega Aegis, uh, 2500, um, Gunstar Heroes collection that also comes

629
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:22,380
with Dynamite Headdy and, um, some other treasure game.

630
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:28,020
It's the treasure box, but I wanted to get him that so he could, and I'm trying to convince

631
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,020
him first.

632
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:34,900
I'm going to try to convince him first to stream Gunstar Heroes through the PS2, um,

633
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:42,020
but I'm also deciding if I think I am going to do the Halo thing, if I can get my mom's

634
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,900
rent paid for next month.

635
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:49,140
So, and I would have to do it from a place that's already set up to stream off Xbox.

636
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,840
Actually, I'm not set up for Xbox.

637
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,060
I don't know if there's any Halos on PC that I have, but I can check that out.

638
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:01,460
Um, but I don't actually usually, I mean, it's not hard to do the Xbox.

639
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:08,500
I'm not set up at mine too, but, um, well, if I'll talk to you off air.

640
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,500
You've got the mic stuff set up.

641
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,500
Yeah.

642
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,620
I was gonna say, I'll talk to you off air because there's things and reasons why Twitch

643
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,500
broadcasting may soon be portable.

644
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,820
So all right, anyway, uh, let's see.

645
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:23,480
Going to chat, uh, at live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf says, Wii U still has virtual

646
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,480
console.

647
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,480
Yes, that's true.

648
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,980
Uh, Wii U does have virtual console.

649
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,000
That's why I didn't say it's dead.

650
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,920
That's why I said it's more like last call.

651
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,160
That's a good way to put it.

652
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,560
As far as we use concern last call, uh, act def says you can probably get master chief

653
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,640
collection for the Xbox one.

654
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,720
I have it.

655
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,840
My Xbox one just isn't set up for streaming.

656
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:48,000
It's probably not that hard to get it all set up, but at the same time, you know, we

657
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,960
don't have an Xbox one and I'm not going to have one.

658
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
I thought you guys did.

659
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,960
No.

660
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,960
Oh shoot.

661
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,960
Okay.

662
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,960
We had zero reason to buy one.

663
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,960
There's nothing really on it.

664
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,960
It's that was worthwhile to us.

665
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,840
Maybe 60 to stream the old halos if nothing else.

666
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,840
Yeah.

667
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
Okay.

668
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,840
So we can work something out.

669
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,840
All right.

670
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
Cool.

671
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,840
Uh, let's see.

672
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,840
Let's move on with our gaming weeks.

673
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,840
Loki.

674
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,840
I didn't play much this week.

675
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,240
I mainly played Pokemon just to and from work.

676
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:17,480
Um, I did play a few things today cause we went to fair game, which is a local retro

677
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,800
game store nearby.

678
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,840
So we played some of the arcade games there.

679
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,880
So, um, I played arrow fighters too for briefly cause my youngest son's like, play this game,

680
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,880
play this game.

681
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,280
Like, okay, I'll play this game.

682
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,640
And then my son played on a play choice 10 and he had a, he wanted to play super Mario

683
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,960
brothers two on that.

684
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,960
I'm like, okay, that's weird.

685
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,960
We, I'm like, we have this at home free.

686
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,200
I don't know why I'm gonna play this here.

687
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,360
Um, and they play a little bit of super Mario brothers three as well.

688
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,240
And apparently I'm very rusty when it comes to super Mario brothers three.

689
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,400
I'm like, cause I was like, stand aside, I'll show you how it's done.

690
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,760
And they immediately did not show them how it's done.

691
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,120
I was like, damn, I'm out of practice.

692
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,120
Did dad let them down?

693
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,000
I let myself down.

694
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I was defeated.

695
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Nice.

696
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I had anything else?

697
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,240
Uh, that's it.

698
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,280
Just been mainly working in Unreal.

699
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
All right.

700
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,920
Uh, my gaming week was also not quite as, uh, fun filled as Jamie's just because, um,

701
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,160
again, I was focusing for a performance yesterday.

702
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:24,000
Um, but I did get to play a little bit, so, um, I'm still continuing on doing my, uh,

703
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,520
little gold quests every day in heroes of the storm.

704
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,640
So I'm still playing that, but I pretty much only do versus AI.

705
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,440
And I had such a terrible match last night that I, I thought it was going to be like

706
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,440
the first time I ever, well, maybe, I don't think it's the first time, but like the first

707
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,280
time in like a year that I've actually lost the versus AI mode.

708
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,000
Like I would have been so upset, but we pulled it through in the very end, but I was getting

709
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
worried.

710
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,680
Uh, for those that play heroes of the storm, it was the black hearts bay and somehow the

711
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:55,840
enemy team actually got like two or three turn ins on the cannons, which, you know,

712
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,720
in versus AI, like never happens.

713
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,840
So anyway, it was very frustrating, but we did it.

714
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,960
Uh, let's see.

715
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,280
I've been playing a lot of Lucio in that game because of, uh, the, just the quests I've

716
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,280
been getting.

717
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,840
I got like, when as a support hero, when as an overwatch hero, then again, when as a support

718
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,840
hero.

719
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,840
So I've just been playing quite a bit of a Lucio with that, um, who makes a fun character

720
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,840
in heroes of the storm.

721
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,040
I like, I like some of the overwatch crossover stuff.

722
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,240
I wonder if wrecking balls show up in a heroes of the storm, which means I did play a little

723
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
bit of overwatch.

724
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:31,080
Uh, I've been doing some random heroes have not gotten wrecking ball in random heroes.

725
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,480
I know he's in there cause I see him show up on the other teams, but um, I, one match

726
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,720
I was doing, I kept getting mercy over and over and over again, which is fine cause you

727
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,800
know, I can actually play mercy, but it's when I get the, it's when I get like reaper

728
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:49,160
like the two characters I just, I can't play for crap are reaper and especially tracer.

729
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,720
I just don't understand how to play tracer.

730
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,640
Like I'm trying, like I'm trying, I'm learning more about how like you kind of dart in to

731
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,200
hit somebody in the back line and then pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, and then rewind to get

732
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
back to where you were.

733
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,240
But it's, it's, I, I, I'm better at it with Sombra and I, I really liked the changes they

734
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:13,580
made with Sombra because now the little invisibility and the teleportation mechanism are infinite

735
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,280
amount of time except the teleportation mechanism can be destroyed, but if you hide it well

736
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,840
enough, that won't be a problem.

737
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,380
So that's what I like to do with Sombra is run in there invisible, then make myself visible

738
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,080
to try to get the healer in the back line or at least hack them.

739
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,600
So mercy can't rez or something.

740
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,240
And then the minute they see me, poof, teleport out of there.

741
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,920
So it's, it's kind of like a similar strategy.

742
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,840
I think I'm just better at it with Sombra than I am with tracer.

743
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,760
So let's see, we can hit chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

744
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,760
Let's see.

745
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,480
Bonds 006 says, no, Rob, I don't want any Overwatch in my heroes of the storm.

746
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
Too late.

747
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:54,200
Like six characters from Overwatch in heroes of the storm, like Ana, Lucio, Zarya, Junkrat,

748
00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:00,520
Hanzo, like, and I really enjoy playing Hanzo in heroes of the storm, but I would say he's,

749
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,440
he's probably the third character I get pissed off when I get in random heroes in Overwatch.

750
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,920
Cause I don't like playing with him either.

751
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,920
But oddly I can do Widowmaker.

752
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,200
I just can't do Hanzo.

753
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,200
It's weird.

754
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,920
Uh, let's see.

755
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,480
And then sj100matt says, I can't play tracer either.

756
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Okay, good.

757
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,040
And bonds 006 says, I target all D.Va players.

758
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,040
She is annoying.

759
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:29,000
Uh, D.Va, yeah, D.Va's one of the few tanks that I feel like I can actually sort of play.

760
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,960
I feel like my best tank is Orisa.

761
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,980
I have yet to be able to play any tank as good as I can Orisa, but, um, yeah, I, I do

762
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,980
like D.Va.

763
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,440
D.Va's probably my second or third.

764
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,840
Um, oh, in heroes of the storm though, I don't like D.Va in heroes of the storm.

765
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,320
I don't think, she, she doesn't really work the same way in heroes of the storm.

766
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,080
I don't like her in that game.

767
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:54,560
Um, it's just not the same, so, um, but I've seen other people use her well, I'm just not

768
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,560
good with her.

769
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,320
Anyway, other stuff I played this week, uh, Pokemon Go as well, of course, I'm always

770
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
playing that.

771
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,480
Uh, and I think I mentioned the level 16 in Ingress, I mentioned that last show, right?

772
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,480
Cause I think it was last Friday.

773
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,480
Okay.

774
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,600
Uh, but I'm still playing it.

775
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
I didn't stop.

776
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,960
Uh, and I know they had a big, big Ingress thing, like all the, uh, people that you heard

777
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,200
on the show back in January.

778
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,480
They were all in San Diego cause they had the big live event in San Diego this weekend.

779
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,840
Oh, I got a little pop up when I opened Ingress today.

780
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,000
Yeah, and I, I couldn't, because of Clue again, I couldn't do anything.

781
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,560
You know, sometimes I do behind the scenes support, but I couldn't do it even for this.

782
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,840
So uh, but I'm glad to hear they did, my team did really well, so it was very happy to hear

783
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,840
it.

784
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,180
Um, anyway, um, other stuff that I did play, No Man's Sky next.

785
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,280
So I went back to No Man's Sky this week as I imagine a lot of you did.

786
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,760
Uh, and if you own the game and you haven't gone back, you really should.

787
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,400
I mean, because it's not going to cost you anything.

788
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,080
This is not pay content.

789
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:53,240
This is them trying to Diablo 3 or Final Fantasy 14 their game.

790
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,240
They're trying to bring it back from a game that was very broken and well, I don't know.

791
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,900
I said, let me dial it back.

792
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:03,500
I don't think No Man's Sky was ever like super broken, but clearly it was not the fully realized

793
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,240
game that they were hyping up or that they really wanted it to be.

794
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,180
So they were doing these patches for a little while and then they've kind of been silent

795
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,640
for about nine months while they've been working on this big patch.

796
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,140
So they put out this big patch and now you can do a multiplayer, uh, Dark Soccer.

797
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,140
You might be interested in this.

798
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,500
The default view now is third person.

799
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,180
So No Man's Sky is no longer exclusively a first person thing.

800
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,380
You can play in third person because I know you've talked about on the show before your

801
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:33,500
motion sickness where you way prefer a third person view because you can do that better.

802
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,620
If I didn't have so many things on my list, I would go for it.

803
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,620
Yeah.

804
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,260
I think, I think you would get a kick out of No Man's Sky actually.

805
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,260
I don't know.

806
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,260
I don't know.

807
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,260
It's hard to say.

808
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,820
Sometimes I, I have a hard time judging your tastes.

809
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:48,940
I would have never guessed that you would have become as obsessed with like Dragon Age

810
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,540
and Mass Effect as you did.

811
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,540
You know what I mean?

812
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,540
They're fine.

813
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,020
Yeah, no, I, I, I, but it's mostly because of good character development.

814
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,620
Yeah, no, they do have a great story.

815
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,620
They really do.

816
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:03,220
Um, so anyway, um, but unfortunately No Man's Sky doesn't really have story.

817
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,540
Um, it's more of like a sandbox type of thing.

818
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:10,980
I mean, there is a story, but you know, technically there's a story in Minecraft too.

819
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,980
You know what I mean?

820
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,980
So anyway.

821
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,940
Um, but I, I, yeah, I'm enjoying the updates.

822
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,180
I was doing some live streams, uh, over on my Twitch channel, Rob Roberts on Twitch.

823
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:24,380
And uh, I was doing some streams and, uh, when I was playing one of them, Bobby Blackwolf,

824
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,940
uh, from also from VOG ended up joining my game.

825
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,160
And so he was able to come to my planet.

826
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,980
So in my solar system, I started on a really crappy planet and I think that's what this

827
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,980
game is doing now.

828
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,820
I think it starts you on a crappy planet on purpose so that you have to learn real quick

829
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,860
about the basic techniques for survival.

830
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,020
But the good news is they put in like these quick access menu that make it really easy

831
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:48,660
to like feed yourself the oxygen and the, um, sodium and the stuff that you need to

832
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,540
kind of like for basic life support.

833
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,740
You can feed that really easy as opposed to like having to like open up the menu going

834
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,740
to this.

835
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,740
It was really cumbersome before.

836
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,180
Um, so they made that really easy.

837
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,140
So you learn how to survive really quick, which I actually, even though it was kind

838
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:05,300
of scary and annoying, I think it taught me the game better by doing that.

839
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,300
So anyway, I went to another planet.

840
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,300
It was also very toxic.

841
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,980
But the third planet I went to, I touched down and the little planet scan shows up and

842
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:20,100
it's like sentinels, not very aggressive, um, animal life, peaceful, uh, weather blissful.

843
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:24,700
And everything was like, it was like, this planet is like a casuals dream, right?

844
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,020
There's like nothing going on in this planet and it's a beautiful planet.

845
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,300
So I named it because I remember blissful was the term that stuck out of my mind.

846
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,380
I named the planet Blissey.

847
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:38,020
So there's this planet called Blissey in a universe that Bobby ended up naming Voglandia.

848
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,900
So there's the planet Blissey.

849
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,340
And so Bobby kind of like moved in on that planet.

850
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:47,460
So I created a base and apparently since I stopped, I have not logged in since I made

851
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,460
that base.

852
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,180
Apparently he made a base across the lake as well.

853
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,220
So he's kind of moved in on that planet and I know Dungeon Buster showed up.

854
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,220
My friend Neil showed up.

855
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,620
I don't know if they made bases too, but I know like people have been converging on planet

856
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:03,200
Blissey as kind of like, and that's kind of cool because we were able to do multiplayer.

857
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,620
And so I was running around with Bobby and we were trying to find the only downside to

858
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,720
Blissey that we kind of have learned.

859
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,320
There's like no caves.

860
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,860
There is no natural cave system.

861
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:16,100
And even if you try to make your own caves, like we're not finding anything like the planet

862
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,660
is very flat.

863
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:21,520
So we're not finding the resources we need that are usually underground.

864
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,100
So but we were trying to run around looking for him and I would keep getting distracted

865
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,580
and be like, Bobby, look at this tower over here and we'd be on our jet packs like flying

866
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,580
over there.

867
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,580
And that was kind of cool.

868
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,120
Like that we could go like explore that together.

869
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:37,260
And I didn't realize I think how cool of a feature that was and maybe why people wanted

870
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:41,740
that so bad in the beginning until I kind of experienced that and then experience that

871
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:45,460
we would get to the tower and then Bobby would take the item in the tower before I could

872
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,460
get to it.

873
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:51,580
So that was a whole experience that I didn't get in the original No Man's Sky, but it was

874
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,580
fun.

875
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,580
It was good.

876
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,940
It's like it's 25 bucks for PS4.

877
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,940
Yeah.

878
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:01,540
Um, I think it's been having like a half off sales since I didn't already, you know, spend

879
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,180
a hundred bucks on video games this weekend.

880
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,180
I know.

881
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,180
I hear you.

882
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,780
I feel the fine cheap use too because I'm sure a lot of people just said, ah, fuck this.

883
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,060
And yeah, it might still be out there.

884
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,060
Use it.

885
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,060
Might be harder to find now.

886
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,060
So that people are scooping it up because of the update.

887
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,840
I'm for 25 bucks for the prime.

888
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,940
I should say though, yeah, Bobby and I are on the PS4 version of the game just because

889
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,580
that's, I thought I doubled it.

890
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,660
I thought I did get it on PC at one point.

891
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:26,300
I swear I double dipped and got it on PC, but I don't have it on my computer.

892
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,300
I searched everything.

893
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,100
It's not my steam library and I don't think I would have bought it on GOG.

894
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,340
In fact, I looked on GOG.

895
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,140
It wasn't there and I don't think I bought it anywhere else.

896
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,540
GOG's not getting the update until later.

897
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,100
Yeah, I heard about the GOG stuff.

898
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,260
So, but did you hear that GOG was willing to like refund anybody on that game?

899
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,260
Oh yeah.

900
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,640
GOG came out and was like, if you're unhappy about this, we tried to work with the developer.

901
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,960
You can refund the game basically.

902
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,980
So I thought that was, you know, good man GOG.

903
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,980
Woo.

904
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,980
Yeah.

905
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,980
Okay.

906
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,980
Um, I thought I had it on PC, but I don't.

907
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,300
Alan has it on PC.

908
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:58,540
So I think what happened is that when our steam libraries would still talk to each other,

909
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,060
because that stopped working a long time ago, I think I might've used his copy of No Man's

910
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,060
Sky at one point.

911
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,700
And I think that's why I remember playing it on PC.

912
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:10,500
But anyway, Dungeon Buster says I found a cave on my second visit.

913
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,500
Oh my gosh.

914
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,500
I didn't know that.

915
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,500
Planet Blissey has caves that are just really far apart.

916
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,620
Oh, that's good to know.

917
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,860
You have to mark that somehow so we can find it, Dungeon Buster.

918
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,580
Bobby Blackwool says it only happened once.

919
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,580
I never did it again yet in regards to us stealing from me.

920
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,720
Uh, anyway, so yeah, if you, if you owned No Man's Sky at some point, you really should

921
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,720
check it out again.

922
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:37,620
I think it's worth 25 bucks, 60 bucks, 30 on steam, 60 bucks, 30 is a good price too.

923
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,620
60.

924
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,620
I don't know.

925
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,340
It would really depend on how you feel about the genre.

926
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:46,980
Like if you know what you're getting into, you like sandbox games.

927
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:52,100
This is, you know, don't be like the people that got all pissed off when they bought this

928
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,460
game the first time because they didn't really know what they were getting into.

929
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,460
You know what I mean?

930
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,460
And I just bought it.

931
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,460
Did you really?

932
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,460
It was half price.

933
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,460
Oh, but you have it on PC.

934
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,460
No, no.

935
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,460
I have it on PC.

936
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,980
So, oh, but sadly you can't play with us cause you're on PC.

937
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,980
But that's okay.

938
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,200
Well then I'll refund it.

939
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,460
I'll probably double dip.

940
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,900
Well, you should still play.

941
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,180
I think you'd like it.

942
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,820
Alan's on PC.

943
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,180
You should get him to play.

944
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,180
So anyway.

945
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,180
Alright.

946
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:24,140
If there's anyone else on PC, you should meet up with Dark Sakura.

947
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,140
Let's see.

948
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,220
Oh, they're talking about Pokemon.

949
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:31,900
I'm like, the planet, like any Blissey, is 365 hit points and a pain in the ass to take

950
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,900
down.

951
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,900
There you go.

952
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,900
Brad from Pod Culture's on PC.

953
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,940
So I'm sure there's some people also on PC.

954
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:40,980
I wish they would speak to each other, but we know how Sony is with cross play right

955
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,100
now and it makes me very cross.

956
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,100
Anyway.

957
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,180
There you go with our gaming weeks.

958
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,580
Some quick announcements.

959
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:53,160
There will be no show the weekend of August, I'm trying to remember off the top of my head

960
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,160
or does it have been September?

961
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,060
No, it'll be September 2nd at that point.

962
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:01,020
There'll be no show September 2nd because I will be at Dragon Con and I'm very excited

963
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,020
about that.

964
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:06,540
I had a great time at Dragon Con last year and the last what, six years I've been.

965
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,920
So excited for Dragon Con this year.

966
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,300
Hoping to be able to tell you guys very soon about some panels I'll be working with and

967
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,500
I hope to see you guys there.

968
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,700
But there will be no show Labor Day weekend, September 2nd.

969
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,700
I'll be at Sleep Con.

970
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,700
You'll be at Sleep Con?

971
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,700
Nap Con?

972
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,700
Nap Con.

973
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,700
Sounds like fun.

974
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,020
Well, with a nice long weekend, you guys can do, you know, other stuff too.

975
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,140
So what didn't you, weren't you saying you might hit up SAC Anime because I know that's

976
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,140
that same weekend.

977
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,140
So.

978
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,140
Not this SAC Anime.

979
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,140
I'm planning on January.

980
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,140
Gotcha.

981
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,140
Gotcha.

982
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,060
I'm going to redo my Jill Valentine costume.

983
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,060
Oh, fun.

984
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,060
Good times.

985
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,900
Don't end up a Jill sandwich.

986
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,900
All right.

987
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,660
Let's get into some gaming news.

988
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,300
Loki, what, what else happened in games this week?

989
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,300
All right.

990
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,860
So this week, uh, we had Nintendo suing pirates.

991
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,860
Yeah.

992
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:56,500
I'm surprised it's taken so long to do that, but, um, apparently they have filed lawsuits

993
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:03,380
against two ROM sites, one called Love ROMs and the other one LoveRetro.co, which are

994
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:11,140
both operated by some guy named Jacob Matthias and are built entirely on the brazen and mass

995
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:15,420
scale infringement and Nintendo's intellectual property rights.

996
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,820
I've never heard of these sites and I know I don't use these sites for getting ROMs,

997
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,220
so I'm kind of surprised that this is who they targeted first.

998
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:28,260
I think one of these sites, maybe both of them, the big difference that I noticed that

999
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:33,100
probably made them a target was the fact that you could play the games right there in the

1000
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:36,580
browser, like the emulator and the game were both together.

1001
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,580
It was like an in-browser emulator.

1002
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:40,580
I've been looking at, has the same thing.

1003
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,580
No, I know.

1004
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:42,580
I know.

1005
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,580
Please.

1006
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,580
It's like porn.

1007
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,580
There's ROM sites everywhere.

1008
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:50,580
So, you know, this is clearly some type of scare move by Nintendo.

1009
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,580
I don't know.

1010
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:56,500
It's weird because look, I, I don't want to say like, like the reality is when you get

1011
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:01,820
into this whole business with ROMs, you are getting into this real gray area when it comes

1012
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,820
to legality.

1013
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,640
You're just going to push it underground more.

1014
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,800
It's just going to go into torrents instead.

1015
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,940
You're just going to have to download the whole ROM sets instead.

1016
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,020
And they're not solving any problem.

1017
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,500
They're just kind of sweeping it under the rug basically.

1018
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:19,220
It's like, Oh yeah, you're not going to eliminate piracy of your ROMs on the internet.

1019
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,980
And what's the point even cause you don't have your fucking virtual console anymore.

1020
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,560
Well on they're gearing up for that.

1021
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,560
We know that.

1022
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,560
Right.

1023
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,380
I'm gearing up for that announcement any day now.

1024
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,980
What's it, when's it coming out again?

1025
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,260
How many weeks do we have for them to make that fucking announcement?

1026
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,020
So here's the problem.

1027
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,940
It's the year 2018.

1028
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,300
Okay.

1029
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:47,300
I know I have been using ROMs and NES emulators since I was in college in 1998.

1030
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,040
So like those things have been around for at least 20 years.

1031
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,740
And I know Nintendo has enforced some of this in the past.

1032
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:53,740
It's fine.

1033
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:57,820
But it just seems a little weird where it's like, why now all of a sudden, and as much

1034
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:03,100
as you're sassing what I'm saying here, I do think a part of it is because Nintendo

1035
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:09,060
is about to unleash Switch's version of the retro gaming, whatever it is.

1036
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,460
And so they're setting an example, they're making an example of these to try to scare

1037
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,980
other people off from it.

1038
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,020
But I don't necessarily disagree.

1039
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:19,280
And I don't want to come off as, Oh, I completely like, I get it.

1040
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,180
This is like a legal gray area.

1041
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,600
It's not even really a gray area.

1042
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:26,260
Like you are like, you're not supposed to be doing this now where I think it is a gray

1043
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:32,780
area is well, but if I bought these games, you know, but cause you know, with, with the

1044
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:38,140
patent having expired on the Nintendo hardware technology, something like a retron five,

1045
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,140
which is completely legal to loan.

1046
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,140
What is that doing?

1047
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:45,140
It's dumping your cartridges to a PC format and emulating there on the spot, right?

1048
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:49,620
So I mean like with stuff I already own, it shouldn't be as big of an issue.

1049
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:52,420
And I understand, and I'm sure there's going to be those who want to play devil's advocate

1050
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,420
and shadow.

1051
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,420
Like, no, that's still legal.

1052
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,420
But look, I get it.

1053
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:56,420
I get it.

1054
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,820
But I don't know.

1055
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,660
There's also something about kind of like what you were alluding to where it's like,

1056
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:07,060
how much money is Nintendo really losing on this whole thing?

1057
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:09,980
Especially for people that just want to play games that they already own.

1058
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:16,020
Probably less money than they spent on lawyers for this.

1059
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,020
It's hard to tell.

1060
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,020
I don't know.

1061
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:23,420
Like when it comes to emulating games, I find also that nothing really beats the real thing.

1062
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,700
Um, no, granted.

1063
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,420
I like the classic NES.

1064
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,540
I like the virtual console.

1065
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,380
I realize those are emulated, but nothing really beats the real thing.

1066
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:36,380
I've downloaded the whole Nintendo ROM set like dozens of times, and I still buy their

1067
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:38,500
shit on virtual console.

1068
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:43,860
The only person that's keeping money out of Nintendo's pockets right now is Nintendo.

1069
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:49,340
Because you're not providing me a way to give you money for the game that I want.

1070
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:53,460
So why are you going out through these ROM sites?

1071
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,420
It's not like you, hey, put out the virtual console and nothing's selling because everybody's

1072
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,260
just downloading ROMs for free.

1073
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,260
That's not what's fucking happening.

1074
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:05,220
What's fucking happening is you're not selling the games in the first place.

1075
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,260
I can't give you the money, Nintendo.

1076
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,100
Why do you hate money so much?

1077
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:14,780
Do you think part of it has to do with the classic NES hacking?

1078
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:15,780
Just throwing it out there?

1079
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:20,860
They should have fixed it when either the Super NES came out or when they re-released

1080
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:21,860
the NES.

1081
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,020
They could have fixed that shit, but they didn't.

1082
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,860
Well, but let's be real, Loki.

1083
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,340
A, we all know hackers gonna hack.

1084
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,340
They're never gonna fix them.

1085
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,700
B, if those things are running on Linux, that's especially so, that they were never gonna

1086
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,020
fix those things.

1087
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:38,300
As long as they were running Linux, people were always going to be able to backdoor their

1088
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,900
way into those things and put whatever they want on them.

1089
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,100
Which interestingly enough, I still haven't done with my classic NES.

1090
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,220
I haven't decided if that's something I want to do or not.

1091
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,220
You should.

1092
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:48,220
It's super easy.

1093
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,220
I know.

1094
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,220
I know.

1095
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,220
But I don't know.

1096
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,340
Part of me kind of likes that it's as like a collectible.

1097
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,340
It's untouched.

1098
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,340
It's the way it is.

1099
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,740
If I want to play any of that other stuff, I have it all on PC because I got it years

1100
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:00,740
ago.

1101
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,740
You know what I mean?

1102
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:06,460
But I don't find that I, I guess I don't find that I play a lot of that stuff on PC.

1103
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:10,260
Like when I go through my emulator collection on PC, I'll play something for like five minutes

1104
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:11,880
and I'll be like, cool, next.

1105
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,060
You know, I don't really play those games as like start to finish.

1106
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:19,220
Like the NES controller to actually play stuff.

1107
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,220
True.

1108
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,220
True.

1109
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:24,060
You could just hack it and you wouldn't even notice it.

1110
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,820
You just, you just push in guardian legend.

1111
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:29,940
You wouldn't even notice that anything's different.

1112
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:33,340
It would be all, it looks exactly the same.

1113
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:36,340
You just, it's just, now you have guardian legend in there.

1114
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,380
Uh, bonds, double 06 and chat says, Rob wants to keep his collection of Virgin for as long

1115
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,380
as possible.

1116
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,540
Keep it pure Rob.

1117
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,540
That's right.

1118
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:50,300
I don't want, I don't want your dirty internet hands touching, touching my daughter.

1119
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:58,700
Uh, Brad from pod culture also says it's a super easy to, I guess, hack those things.

1120
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:04,500
So Brad from pod culture suggests you sneak in and hack it while I'm away at dragon con.

1121
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,660
Now that's mean no touching my stuff while I'm not here.

1122
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:12,060
Maybe I'm going to now, now Brad, I'm going to take my classic NES to pod culture.

1123
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:14,940
I'm going to say if I take it to him, he'll hack it.

1124
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,900
I'm going to take my classic NES to dragon con because it is small enough to fit in that

1125
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:19,900
thing.

1126
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:20,900
Just so look, you can't touch it.

1127
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:28,620
I'm not driving over here to hack that thing is not a thing that is on any sort of priority.

1128
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:32,980
All right, let's move on and talk about, uh, changes and other change in gaming.

1129
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:36,940
And this kind of has to do with something that's been an argument, I guess for the past

1130
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:37,940
year or so.

1131
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,500
And that has to do with loot boxes.

1132
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:45,420
Well, uh, turn 10, the developer of forza, motorsport seven has announced that prize

1133
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:49,560
crates will be being removed from forza motorsports seven.

1134
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,420
This is a game that is already out.

1135
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:56,940
Uh, they're going to take out the prize crates, uh, for now, uh, right now, cars are completely

1136
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,540
out of the prize crates.

1137
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:01,020
There are no competitive advantage to them.

1138
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:06,140
There are now only cosmetic items like driver gear and badges and mods that can increase

1139
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:07,580
rewards in single player.

1140
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,940
There used to be cars that were exclusive in prize crates.

1141
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,580
Those can now be bought normally.

1142
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:15,980
Um, what's interesting though, I think what makes this a little bit different is that

1143
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:21,860
the price crates, uh, were never on sale for real money in the games marketplace.

1144
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:27,140
It looked like it was all set up for that, but something stopped them from turning that

1145
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,140
on.

1146
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,660
I wonder what that could have been at the end of last year when forza motorsport came

1147
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:31,660
out.

1148
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:36,060
I don't know, but they never turned on selling these things for real money.

1149
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:39,260
So instead I'm assuming the price crates are must be things that you can like kind of win

1150
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:40,260
from in game.

1151
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,260
Here's what you have to do.

1152
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,620
You have to look at one thing.

1153
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,340
One, is your game free to play?

1154
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:48,140
No, then get that shit out of that fucking game.

1155
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,980
All right.

1156
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:54,340
Uh, so, um, they're going to step further though now that they, even though they're

1157
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:58,020
not selling these things anymore, uh, they are just getting rid of them.

1158
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:04,140
Also, uh, paid tokens will not be in forza motorsport seven or horizon four.

1159
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:09,100
Uh, so even if you don't play the mainline forza games, maybe you play the, uh, horizon

1160
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:13,380
spin off games for coming out again, October, I know I'm excited too.

1161
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:18,840
I'm really excited about that to register participation for this week's episode of orange

1162
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:24,140
on radio at vog network.com use the passphrase side.

1163
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:29,860
So um, yeah, forza horizon four will be coming out in October and uh, these will not be a

1164
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:30,860
part of that.

1165
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:36,980
So they're, they're learning their loot box lesson now so that forza horizon can be pure.

1166
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:37,980
Isn't that nice?

1167
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:38,980
Very refreshing.

1168
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:39,980
Good for doing the right thing.

1169
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,980
I'm not patting you on the back though for it because you should have fucking been doing

1170
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:43,980
this all along.

1171
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:48,700
Uh, Bobby in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com confirms it's October 2nd is the day it comes

1172
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:49,700
out.

1173
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,700
That's even.

1174
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,700
Hooray.

1175
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:52,700
Hooray.

1176
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:53,700
I love me.

1177
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:54,700
So we're still disappointed by Nintendo's announcement.

1178
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:55,700
We still have horizon four.

1179
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,700
That's right.

1180
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,300
There's still something to look forward to.

1181
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,780
Someone's got our back on the horizon.

1182
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:04,560
I'm not, I'm not even going to.

1183
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,020
Next up on the horizon, dark Sakura.

1184
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:11,820
Well, there are going to be some new arcade cabinets released for old games.

1185
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:17,720
They um, are from arcade one up and they will have different games featured for each package.

1186
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,940
There's going to be a centipede cabinet that has centipede millipede missile command and

1187
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,940
crystal castles.

1188
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:27,580
So I guess all the track ball games, um, an asteroids cabinet that has asteroids, tempest,

1189
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:33,500
major havoc and lunar Lander, uh, then one with rampage defender, joust and gauntlet.

1190
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:38,420
And then a street fighter two championship cabinet, which is a street fighter two championship

1191
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:43,180
edition super street fighter two new challengers and super street fighter two turbo.

1192
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:47,440
And then the final fight cabinet, which is final fight 1944, the loop master ghosts and

1193
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,020
goblins and Strider.

1194
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:57,500
Um, they're about 400 a pop and they are three quarter size of the original cabinets and

1195
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,180
it will come with a cabinet riser and a potential stool.

1196
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,180
He needed to build them.

1197
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,660
They're like Ikea for arcade cabinets.

1198
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:05,660
Yeah.

1199
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:06,660
I mean, it's like a lot of furniture.

1200
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,660
Pretty good.

1201
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:08,660
Yeah.

1202
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:09,660
So I mentioned they're kind of like this.

1203
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,700
I mean, I, sorry you guys, it's a radio show, but I imagine they're kind of like this thing

1204
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,700
that we have in studio, which was at Loki's old work.

1205
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,700
I mentioned they're kind of like that.

1206
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,580
That's a bar top cabinet though.

1207
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,580
It's an actual standup.

1208
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:21,700
Have you seen the smaller cabinets that they have at California extreme?

1209
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:22,700
I actually haven't.

1210
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,100
They look like they're for small teenagers.

1211
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,100
Yeah.

1212
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,100
That's about the size.

1213
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,100
Interesting.

1214
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,100
Okay.

1215
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,980
Probably about five foot.

1216
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:32,980
Yeah.

1217
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:33,980
I don't know.

1218
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:37,220
Like I would almost be interested in getting one, but the price is a little high.

1219
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:44,180
You know, it's hard to justify when I know our cabinet, I don't think that's with a 17

1220
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,180
inch LCD monitor.

1221
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,180
Yeah, that's true.

1222
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,700
And that's the monitor that probably makes the price so high.

1223
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,700
You know what I mean?

1224
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,700
It's basically a television.

1225
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:56,460
I don't see why it's high at all because you can to buy a full size arcade cabinet sometimes

1226
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:04,020
without the monitor is still somewhere between 300 to, you know, 700 depending on the cabinet.

1227
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,020
Yeah, I guess that's true.

1228
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,460
And that's one game.

1229
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:10,820
Maybe I'm also thinking like about space just from the perspective of, again, because this

1230
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:13,920
thing is here and just in general, I really don't.

1231
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,660
It's kind of like the same conundrum I have with pinball machines in here.

1232
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:20,100
As much as I would love to own my own pinball machine, I'm like, there's no space.

1233
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,980
Keep in mind a pinball, you're looking in the thousands.

1234
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,220
Oh yeah, no, I know that.

1235
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,300
I know that.

1236
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,360
So I don't know.

1237
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:32,220
It's one of those things where it's like, if I had more of that space and the desire,

1238
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,220
I might do it.

1239
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,220
Especially that Final Fight cabinet.

1240
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:35,220
Sounds like the best one.

1241
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,220
The one with Strider on it.

1242
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:37,640
Yeah, the one with Strider on it.

1243
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,100
That sounds like the best one for sure.

1244
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:42,500
And again, I already have an Ultracade, so.

1245
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,500
Do you kick it?

1246
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,500
Sometimes.

1247
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,500
Okay, good.

1248
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,500
All right.

1249
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,380
Well, I think it is a neat little collection thing.

1250
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:52,860
It is interesting too, how like Walmart is selling these and like Walmart has been in

1251
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,580
like the classic arcade business.

1252
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:55,980
I loved your little games again.

1253
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,060
No, that's fine.

1254
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,480
But like, and so there's the itty bitty way.

1255
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,480
Those are like keychain itty bitty games, right?

1256
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:02,480
Or how big are those?

1257
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,480
Well, no.

1258
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,980
Yeah, the ones I got you were about half as tall.

1259
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:06,980
Okay.

1260
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:11,820
And so she's pointing at the like the $20 ones that were like the tiny little cabinets

1261
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:17,420
that are out there too, with like Cuber and Asteroids and stuff.

1262
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:22,660
So yeah, so it's like Walmart is like in this classic retro arcade biz, all of a sudden

1263
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,060
it's very interesting.

1264
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:29,300
So going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1265
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,700
Dark Tetsuya says Walmart is only $300.

1266
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:35,380
I guess that's what they do is undercut everybody else.

1267
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:38,620
Dark Tetsuya says, I think they're a little bit bigger than the bar top.

1268
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:40,720
The risers are supposed to help.

1269
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,000
These will work right out of the box after you put them together.

1270
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,460
Getting a cabinet off Craigslist, you might get a mostly working machine.

1271
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:52,820
It is, I will say though, it is still my dream someday to own a baby Pac-Man machine

1272
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:56,780
that is still like the thing that I want more than anything.

1273
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:01,780
So all right, well, let's move on with some more news.

1274
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:02,780
Loki.

1275
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,440
All right.

1276
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:13,660
So IntiCrate is actually looking at, they want to remake Zelda 2.

1277
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:18,300
And you may remember them from such wonderful games on the Nintendo platforms, like Blaster

1278
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:25,180
Master Zero, or they also had, oh yeah, they also did the bloodsitting curse of the moon

1279
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:26,820
thing that was on there in Mighty Gunvel.

1280
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,340
So they did Mighty No. 9 too.

1281
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:35,500
Yeah, it was, yeah, unfortunately it's okay, but everything else is good.

1282
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,500
So that's fine.

1283
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:41,980
But apparently, you know, saying that, yeah, he would love to make it a new adventure of

1284
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:44,220
Link for the modern era.

1285
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:48,220
One that doesn't play like crap.

1286
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,220
Uh, yeah, hopefully.

1287
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,220
I'm sorry, I don't like Zelda 2.

1288
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,220
Dan really likes it though.

1289
00:57:54,220 --> 00:58:00,220
But I'd be cool like with a game that didn't suck that was that style, like a, I don't

1290
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,220
know.

1291
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:03,260
I like Zelda 2.

1292
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:04,260
I get it's different.

1293
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:05,940
I get why it puts people off.

1294
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,460
I totally get why it puts people off, but I really like it for what it is.

1295
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:13,620
And I would so be on board with IntiCrate's getting it, but I just don't think, Nintendo

1296
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:18,820
is, well, I'm about to say Nintendo is never going to let another company touch one of

1297
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,260
their biggest properties.

1298
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:25,020
But as those words leave my mouth, I then remember Metroid Other M. I then remember,

1299
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:28,180
well, heck that, uh, latest Metroid game, you know?

1300
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:32,860
So like it's, it's not like it's that uncommon, but it's just like Nintendo letting someone

1301
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:35,140
else make a Zelda.

1302
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,700
I don't know about that.

1303
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:37,700
I know.

1304
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:40,200
I'm just like, oh, I would love to see it.

1305
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,840
Didn't Capcom help with like one of the four swords adventures or something like that?

1306
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:50,480
Or I thought that like they had other, they've had third parties do things, but I think it

1307
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,000
was reaching out to the third parties for that.

1308
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Reach out.

1309
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,320
It's not like, you know, more Zelda games would be a terrible thing.

1310
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:03,720
Well, I just want to see what IntiCrate's is going to be working on next because I think

1311
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,040
they they've been doing some great stuff.

1312
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,640
Obviously I love that Blaster Master Zero.

1313
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,920
That was a great, you know, especially because I was worried about Blaster Master because

1314
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,320
you know, some of the other reimaginings have not been so great.

1315
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,920
I think they really did a good job with that one.

1316
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:19,080
So I'm, uh, I, you know what, if they want to try their hand at Zelda two, what's the

1317
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,200
worst that could happen?

1318
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:25,080
It can't possibly be as bad as Zelda, um, 3D Oh,

1319
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,080
exactly.

1320
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,080
I know that.

1321
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,800
Listen, that was a long time ago.

1322
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,280
I think you learned your lesson with, you know, licensing that out to third parties

1323
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:40,000
on other systems and also movie licensing rights, but it's a different, it's a different

1324
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
decade now.

1325
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,080
I mean, we can put that all behind us and try again.

1326
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,080
It's a new decade.

1327
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,080
Let's come together and try to do this again.

1328
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,080
All right.

1329
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:55,080
Well, uh, also for a new decade, uh, we are having, uh, a, I think a kind of a popular

1330
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:59,160
music game from, from some people, for some people, I don't know if everybody's ever experienced

1331
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:05,080
this game, but it's a game called Taiko no Tatsujin, uh, this is, uh, was once released

1332
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:09,640
here in the States as Taiko Drum Master, um, because that's what it, that's what Taiko

1333
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:10,640
no Tatsujin means.

1334
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,360
Um, but this, I think it was released on the Wii, I want to say, as Taiko Drum Masters.

1335
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,360
That sound right, you guys?

1336
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,360
I think so.

1337
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:21,640
Uh, well, it's going to be coming out again, uh, Taiko no Tatsujin, Drum Session and Taiko

1338
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:26,560
no Tatsujin, Drum and Fun, uh, they're going to come out for PS4 and Nintendo Switch.

1339
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,280
And, uh, I think one is for PS4, the other's Nintendo Switch.

1340
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,440
They're going to come out actually in Western and European territories.

1341
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:36,320
So we're going to get a localized release of these games on November 2nd.

1342
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,320
And that's pretty cool.

1343
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:40,720
Um, there's a whole little post on the PlayStation blog about it.

1344
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,520
Uh, they're going to bring in some songs from, uh, some things you might've heard of like

1345
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:50,640
Neon Genesis Evangelion, uh, Vocaloid Producers, I'm assuming that means Masunomiku, uh, Disney

1346
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,040
Favorites from Zootopia and Frozen.

1347
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,960
Although if Let It Go is one of the songs, I will probably put a hole in my drum.

1348
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,360
So I don't know about that.

1349
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:04,440
Um, but anyway, also songs from other Namco properties like Tekken, the Tales series,

1350
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:08,120
Idolmaster, you know, what's missing from that list?

1351
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:14,680
Katamari Damacy, just saying, anyway, the PS4 has ranked mode and there will be motion

1352
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,020
controls in the Nintendo Switch version.

1353
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:22,740
Although honestly, if there is not a physical drum, don't do it because, uh, the whole like

1354
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:27,100
waving the Wiimotes around, I realize we're in like HD motion detection now and this stuff,

1355
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,700
it's just, it's not going to be the same.

1356
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,340
It's not going to be the same if it's not a tangible drum.

1357
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:36,420
Anyway, uh, no word on if the controller peripheral is coming out in the West.

1358
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:40,980
So if there's no official controller, you may just have to play this on PlayStation

1359
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:44,260
4, like with X's and O's and that, I don't know if that would be the same.

1360
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:49,020
Anyway, apparently Bandai Namco did confirm later in the week, there is no set plan to

1361
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,540
bring that drum controller to North America.

1362
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:56,260
I don't know guys, that kind of loses a lot of it for me.

1363
01:01:56,260 --> 01:02:02,140
Anyway, it will have a physical release in America on both PS4 and Switch, digital only

1364
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:03,140
in Europe.

1365
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:06,020
So it will not, although you'll get a localized version, you'll only be able to get it on

1366
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:12,320
the store, uh, which is, I mean, kind of like how they released a DJ Max on PS4 over here.

1367
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,820
So there you go.

1368
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:18,020
Anyway, let's move on to a different sort of story, but something a little more positive.

1369
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:19,020
Right, Darsakra?

1370
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:26,220
There was a study that was conducted at Harvard Medical School in 2017 that was released that

1371
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:32,820
talks about how loneliness can be more detrimental to your health than smoking would be.

1372
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:38,780
And talked about increasing the relationships through your friends and family members through

1373
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:39,780
games.

1374
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:43,780
And it was even saying that video games contribute to that as well.

1375
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:49,980
They also found out that the games have the ability to change your brain structurally

1376
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:52,380
and functionally.

1377
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:57,660
It can promote neurogenesis, which is the growth of new neurons, and neuroplasticity,

1378
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:02,180
which is the change in neural pathways and synapses.

1379
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:05,420
Basically it keeps your brain alert and functioning well.

1380
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:10,700
There are also showing in another study in 2017 that was published in frontiers in human

1381
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:21,020
neuroscience that gamers who got together to play games like Baduke or Go had an increase

1382
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:23,580
in their gray matter.

1383
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:33,180
And a decrease in the, I'm going to mispronounce this, amygdala, which I guess is a good thing.

1384
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:37,740
But basically the gray matter increase in the nucleus acumen leads to more positive

1385
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:40,460
experiences and enthusiasm.

1386
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:45,780
The decrease in gray matter in the amygdala leads to stress reduction and an increased

1387
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,780
calmness.

1388
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:53,100
But also, especially with action video games, they found that it increased your gray matter

1389
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:59,780
and functional connectivity in other regions of the brain.

1390
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:05,260
Especially into the cerebral cortex, which is responsible for self-awareness and present

1391
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:07,180
moments awareness.

1392
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:13,420
So basically it leads to better decision making and better intuition.

1393
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:18,380
Board games are really good for increasing strength in the hippocampus and the prefrontal

1394
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:25,100
cortex, which usually improve cognitive functions that affect IQ, memory, and information retention

1395
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,720
and problem solving.

1396
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:32,460
So basically playing games of strategy and playing video games help increase your memory,

1397
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:43,660
increase your mood for the most part, and also can functionally affect your brain biologically.

1398
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:47,980
Can they make you as cool as smoking cigarettes?

1399
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:48,980
Stop it now.

1400
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:49,980
Stop.

1401
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:56,740
Well one of the other things too is that playing collaborative games improves your computational

1402
01:04:56,740 --> 01:05:04,820
thinking, including skills affecting logic, distributed processing, debugging, and simulation

1403
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,040
and algorithm building.

1404
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:14,240
So basically collaborative strategy games will increase your ability to code or pick

1405
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,240
up coding.

1406
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:22,800
Yeah, you know, and I remember when I was younger.

1407
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:26,720
Maybe some of these tricks we use on young children can also work on Loki, who knows?

1408
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:33,280
But I remember when I was younger, when Apple IIe's and Commodore 64's were all the rage,

1409
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,980
all the schools had Apple IIe's, right?

1410
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:37,060
That was like the school computer.

1411
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:41,220
And they would actually have, I don't know if it was like the Parks and Rec or if it

1412
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:42,980
was like some type of summer school thing.

1413
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:48,260
But I remember they would have nighttime classes on learn how to do basic programming on an

1414
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:49,400
Apple IIe.

1415
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,420
I think a lot of it, I want to say, was logo.

1416
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:56,420
Now I'm sure, and not to be confused with a television network that brought us RuPaul's

1417
01:05:56,420 --> 01:06:02,080
Drag Race, that's something very different, but logo was a programming language, like

1418
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:06,400
in the 80s, that was on Apple IIe and I think they made versions of it for other things

1419
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,400
as well.

1420
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,600
And it was the whole thing where you had the turtle, it was a graphics drawing program,

1421
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,600
right?

1422
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,280
So you would do things like, and I don't remember all the instructions, some of you guys probably

1423
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:20,400
remember this better, but it was like pen down, forward 30, turn 90, and it was like

1424
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,400
you turn the angle.

1425
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,780
But like what you could do is you could build like, I think there was maybe like if then

1426
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:28,220
or there were ways to build loops so that when you wrote a certain thing, you could

1427
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:31,940
actually build like a spiral graph sort of thing where you get the turtle to turn a certain

1428
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:36,160
degrees, draw a square, he would make these really pretty shapes and you could like have

1429
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,040
it change the colors.

1430
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:41,660
And so you, but that's what I did when I was like seven years old that kind of like taught

1431
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:45,300
me about programming and I feel like some of that made me more smarter.

1432
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:50,340
Well, here's the other good thing though about video games in particular, is that they're

1433
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:55,760
actually showing that video games can help with children with dyslexia.

1434
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:05,220
And also other benefits, the big thing is increased, will increase metacognition.

1435
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:11,080
So basically metacognition is thinking about thinking and part of meditation.

1436
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:15,960
And they were showing that for children and adults, but mostly children who would play

1437
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:22,900
games and then meditate and follow these in certain cycles, actually found other increase

1438
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:33,580
in not just their cognition, but in their joy in participating in things.

1439
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:39,740
So really I find it very fascinating, you know, we have this camp who likes to make

1440
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:47,080
video games the scapegoat for everything, but in the long run though, playing these

1441
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:52,200
games are actually kind of good for you.

1442
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,200
Who said more smarter?

1443
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,200
I did.

1444
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,200
I was making it funny.

1445
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:02,080
I said, learning all that stuff at a young age made me more smarter.

1446
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:06,800
You missed the joke because you were focused on your story.

1447
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:13,020
So anyhow, but Loki's response in chat said, I know it's smarter, I should have said more

1448
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:14,020
smarter.

1449
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:15,020
All right.

1450
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:18,260
Anyway, in all seriousness, let me get some comments in the chat.

1451
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:24,860
Less dumb is legit to tell someone not to be, or to tell someone to be, like world be

1452
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:25,860
less dumb.

1453
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:26,860
Loki be less dumb.

1454
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:27,860
All right.

1455
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:32,800
Bobby Black Wolf in chat, who's not dumb at all, says the TI 85 calculator had a similar

1456
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,540
drawing system logo.

1457
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:36,320
Here's another great thing I remember from younger.

1458
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,080
I had a friend program pole position.

1459
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,080
Oh yeah.

1460
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,080
You could do like mini games.

1461
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,080
I remember there's a Tetris one floating around.

1462
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,080
You could do assembly on that son of a bitch.

1463
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,080
Those things were powerful little things.

1464
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,080
Powerful little fuckers, weren't they?

1465
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,080
Yeah, they sure were.

1466
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,080
And yet-

1467
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,080
And expensive.

1468
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,080
They were expensive, especially at the time.

1469
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,080
I could only afford an 82.

1470
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,080
I feel like-

1471
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:59,120
I have a TI 85 somewhere because I had to have it for, not chemistry, but algebra.

1472
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,720
Do they still make TI 85s?

1473
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,720
I feel like they probably do.

1474
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:02,720
Yes, they do.

1475
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:03,720
Yeah.

1476
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:06,260
And they're probably like 20 bucks now when-

1477
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:07,260
Nope.

1478
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:08,260
Oh really?

1479
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:09,260
No, they're still expensive.

1480
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:10,260
Hold on.

1481
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:11,260
I'll get you the price.

1482
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:12,260
Really?

1483
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:13,260
I would have thought maybe because of the technology and everything.

1484
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:19,720
It's because they have a hold on that math market, and so it's like you pay up fuckers.

1485
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:20,720
Game boy games ain't free anymore.

1486
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:21,720
Okay, I take that back.

1487
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:24,900
People are selling them for about 20 bucks to nine bucks on eBay.

1488
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:29,300
I think that's been replaced by the TA, I want to say by a different TI because I had

1489
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:30,300
a different one.

1490
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,380
Maybe a TI 87 was the one I had?

1491
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:33,380
Let me look real quick.

1492
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:39,120
TI 82, and I remember I had to try to build a serial cable for it, and that was not fun.

1493
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,720
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, TI still corners the market on graphing calculators, so I'm

1494
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,720
sure they must have some sort of patent or something that allows them to kind of do that.

1495
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:46,720
You know what I mean?

1496
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:49,360
I think though, nowadays though, I'd imagine that that would be coming down because couldn't

1497
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,360
you just download an app for your phone to do the same damn shit?

1498
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:56,600
Well, okay, here's the thing, TI 84 is okay, that was the one I had in college.

1499
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:01,560
The problem with it is that, and I even asked my teacher about that because the iPhone has

1500
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:07,860
a graphing calculator built into it, but you can also use your iPhone for many other things,

1501
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:13,380
including looking up answers and using automatic tools, so they always had us put away our

1502
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:15,420
phone and bust out the graphing calculator.

1503
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:20,180
I get it, so you can use a graphing calculator on a test, but you can't use a phone on a

1504
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:21,180
test.

1505
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:22,180
Precisely.

1506
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:23,180
Or you can write down your notes on the graphing calculator.

1507
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:27,260
Yeah, I was going to say, if you put pole position on a graphing calculator, you could

1508
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:28,260
probably-

1509
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:29,260
I'm going to put the fucking internet.

1510
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:31,540
But I think the average person doesn't know how to do it.

1511
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:39,200
Yeah, and right now, the TI 84 graphing calculator is about 90 bucks.

1512
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:44,560
Bobby, or excuse me, it's actually Bob Coffee in chat says, it's not a patent, it's educational

1513
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,560
contracts.

1514
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:46,560
Interesting.

1515
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:50,400
Isn't that how Apple got through some of its darkest years too, like pre iPhone, iTunes,

1516
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,400
and all that?

1517
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:55,080
Like it was because it's educational contracts, like the fact that they were in every school,

1518
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:59,480
every institution really kind of kept on going through some of the darker years of the company.

1519
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:00,720
This is crazy.

1520
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:03,940
Texas Instruments stock is at $112.

1521
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:04,940
Wow.

1522
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:08,660
So, they're clearly doing something right.

1523
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:13,180
Yeah, by not giving away tickets to movies.

1524
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:14,180
Interesting.

1525
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:18,340
So, Bobby points out, Apple and TI did do the same thing with educational contracts.

1526
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:22,420
He also said, and he brought up the same point that we eventually got to, that they won't

1527
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:26,860
let their kids have a phone out during the test, but I still programmed equations into

1528
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:27,980
my TI 85.

1529
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:30,260
The program was named ZZZ.

1530
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:31,800
I was sneaky.

1531
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:38,400
Well, Bobby Blackwell, if a true nerd would have named it ZZZT, I'm actually on the Texas

1532
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:47,680
Instruments website and the TI 89 titanium, holy crap, it actually does wireframe and

1533
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:52,040
you can kill a man with it.

1534
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:53,960
TI 89 titanium.

1535
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:58,040
That sounds like one of the weapons in the movie last night and they have a color one

1536
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:02,020
now called the TI Nspire.

1537
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:03,020
Oh my God.

1538
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:04,420
It's just absolutely crazy.

1539
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,060
It's got CAD built in.

1540
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:10,740
You tell me what other gaming podcast devolves into a conversation on graphing calculators.

1541
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:11,740
Oh, I'm sure there's plenty.

1542
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:12,740
You find it.

1543
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,740
I'm sure there's plenty.

1544
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:15,740
Alright.

1545
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:19,980
This week we're focusing on the Texas Instruments.

1546
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:25,100
I think next year Dark Soccer should do the classic calculator of the month.

1547
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:26,100
Girl.

1548
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,100
Alright.

1549
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,160
Alright.

1550
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:32,520
This week it's Casio watch calculator.

1551
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,520
Oh my God.

1552
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,520
Okay.

1553
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:40,360
We could fill 12 months of calculating because you, you could totally have the Casio watch.

1554
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,640
Oh my God.

1555
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,120
That takes me fucking back.

1556
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,620
The Casio watch calculators.

1557
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:47,520
And then I remember the one that looked like a little professor.

1558
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,520
Do you guys know what I'm talking?

1559
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,520
There was like a professor calculator.

1560
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,860
It looked like a little dude with a mustache.

1561
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:52,860
Somebody's got to know what I'm talking about.

1562
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:55,180
This time we're doing your parents calculator.

1563
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:56,180
That's right.

1564
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:57,260
A rule.

1565
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:58,260
An abacus.

1566
01:12:58,260 --> 01:12:59,260
Abacus.

1567
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:00,260
Yeah.

1568
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:01,760
You know what I could do though?

1569
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,760
A speak in math.

1570
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,760
Classic computer of the month.

1571
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:05,760
Okay.

1572
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:10,760
I'll start off with the IBM 486.

1573
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:11,760
Alright.

1574
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:12,760
I'm loving it.

1575
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:13,760
Anyway.

1576
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,760
Uh, in the meantime we got to get to some more news so we can get to the actual classic

1577
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:17,760
game of the week.

1578
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,160
But how about a new game first, Loki?

1579
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,160
Yeah.

1580
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,160
I'm actually kind of excited about this.

1581
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:24,060
I don't really care for the labo stuff cause well, okay.

1582
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:25,060
I take that back.

1583
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:29,420
I care for the price of the labo stuff is what I really meant to say.

1584
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:34,080
But they have a new labo set that's going to be coming out and this one's basically

1585
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,700
about driving or vehicles or whatever.

1586
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:41,860
So you can build three separate vehicles with it and they have like this different key that

1587
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:42,880
goes in there.

1588
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,820
So there's like a driving one that actually has a foot pedal.

1589
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:52,340
There's like a submarine thing and an airplane joystick and that should be coming out.

1590
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:57,180
I don't know when the date is on that, but the trailer is pretty cool and we don't know

1591
01:13:57,180 --> 01:14:03,020
the price yet, but I'm assuming it's going to be around the same price either 69 or $79.

1592
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:04,020
But neat.

1593
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:05,020
Oh, September.

1594
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:06,020
That's right.

1595
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:08,940
September is supposed to come out.

1596
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:12,980
Just for the record, Dark Tetsuya found it cause that's, that's what our live listeners

1597
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:13,980
do.

1598
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:15,760
The calculator was called the little professor.

1599
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,460
It was a little, little professor was the name of it.

1600
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:23,580
And his little hat is that, um, what did they call the screens that were like the real

1601
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:29,860
red glowing led or were they led LCD, but they were red and glowing and looking for

1602
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:30,860
evil.

1603
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:31,860
Yeah.

1604
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:35,540
They used to make alarm clocks out of those back in the day and it was like, it's 6am.

1605
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:36,660
You're going to go to hell.

1606
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:38,740
Like that's what things look like in the dark.

1607
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:39,740
Virtual boy.

1608
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:40,740
Yeah.

1609
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:41,740
They still sell those.

1610
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:42,740
What little professors?

1611
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:43,740
No, the clocks.

1612
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:44,740
Oh really?

1613
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:45,740
Oh my gosh.

1614
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:46,740
I have one for my son.

1615
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:47,740
All right.

1616
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:48,740
Both my kids have those.

1617
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:49,740
Scare.

1618
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:50,740
I'm young.

1619
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:51,740
All right.

1620
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:52,740
They're blue.

1621
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:53,740
I mean, they're not red.

1622
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:59,060
Well, speaking of amazing computers and it's, I, it's almost like we planned it this way.

1623
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:06,380
Uh, the Commodore 64 mini is coming to the U S very cool about this.

1624
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:13,420
So, uh, the common, the C 64 mini is, uh, going to be loaded with ready for this 64

1625
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:15,540
classic titles.

1626
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:19,420
Where did they pull that number out of the hat?

1627
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:23,660
Remember, remember just last week on this show when you couldn't remember how much memory

1628
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:30,340
was in a Commodore 64 Loki, I didn't have a Commodore 64, 64 kilobytes.

1629
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:35,200
That could, that 64 can admit anything anyway, it could have been the speed.

1630
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,200
It could have been anything.

1631
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,200
All right.

1632
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,200
Be quiet.

1633
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:42,100
Some of the notable titles include California games, winter games, impossible mission to,

1634
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:47,140
Oh, I hope the first one's there to, uh, Boulder dash, uh, jump man, pit stop to speedball

1635
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:52,900
to street sports, baseball, summer games to the temple of app, shy trilogy, uh, your radium.

1636
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:55,660
Like I know some of you guys are like, I've never heard of this shit.

1637
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:58,140
Those are all fucking classics that I just named right there.

1638
01:15:58,140 --> 01:15:59,920
Amazing, amazing list of games there.

1639
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,820
So of course it all connects via HTMI.

1640
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:06,540
Uh, and I guess right now, uh, October 9th is the date that they're targeting and you

1641
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:11,340
can get more details at the C 64.com.

1642
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:16,460
And if I remember right, you can still, you, because it actually is like a full functional

1643
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:17,460
keyboard and everything.

1644
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:20,820
You can still use these like they are a Commodore 64.

1645
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:27,060
So yeah, they say complete with a fully working version of C 64 basic and a USB joystick.

1646
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:29,380
So I can actually start to write programs.

1647
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:31,920
I don't know how it's going to save or any of that stuff.

1648
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,600
And I'm sure, I'm sure somebody's already figured it because I think this thing's already

1649
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,020
been out in Europe where the Commodore 64 is even bigger.

1650
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:44,700
I'm sure somebody's thought of a way to like load their own C 64 discs and disc images

1651
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:45,700
onto this thing.

1652
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:46,700
There's gotta be.

1653
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:52,140
So I can play like the C 64 games that I loved that nobody else loved, like the Dragon's

1654
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:54,020
Lair games.

1655
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:58,300
I'm telling you the Dragon's Lair games, there was two of them because, um, and it's nothing

1656
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:02,420
like the Dragon's Lair arcade game because obviously the arcade game is too, it was too

1657
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:06,700
strong graphically, but the music in those games are some of my favorite chiptunes like

1658
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:10,500
ever in like the C 64 era.

1659
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,500
Anyway.

1660
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:15,880
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, you don't even have to hack it.

1661
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:18,260
They tell you exactly how to do it.

1662
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:23,340
A new firmware update will allow you to have more than just one D 64 file.

1663
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:27,220
Well that's pretty awesome, especially because I think one reason they kind of have to do

1664
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:32,500
this is that those disc images, like those magnetic discs are like eroding over time.

1665
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,740
Like those discs are not holding up all these years later.

1666
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:40,740
So are we going to be, are we going to be able to run Gios on this?

1667
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:41,740
You know what Gios is?

1668
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:46,100
It made your Commodore 64 look just like a early, early Macintosh early cause it was

1669
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:52,060
like graphic evolution, something operating system, graphic enhanced, gravity enhanced

1670
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:53,060
operating system.

1671
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:54,060
Gios.

1672
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:55,060
Let's give it a gooey.

1673
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:56,060
Anyway.

1674
01:17:56,060 --> 01:18:03,500
The only game I ever played on the Commodore 64 was kickstart motorcycle racing game.

1675
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,500
Oh man.

1676
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,500
I'm so excited.

1677
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:08,700
I can't wait for this to come out because then I'm going to be hooking it up and like

1678
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:10,100
streaming all the things on Twitch.

1679
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:13,140
I'm so excited cause I love color 64 anyway.

1680
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:18,380
The classic game of the week, however, dark soccer is going to dip into the gaming archives.

1681
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:22,460
Sadly not from the Commodore 64, but there's just so many things to pick from, you know,

1682
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:25,200
so dark soccer has picked a mighty fine choice this week.

1683
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:29,100
I'm assuming it's gotta be something that came from California extreme.

1684
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,100
I don't know.

1685
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:31,100
Maybe.

1686
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:32,100
No.

1687
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,100
Oh wow.

1688
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:34,100
That's something that got inspired from that.

1689
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:35,100
All right.

1690
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:36,100
Well then let's get to it.

1691
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:37,100
I already had an idea to do this one.

1692
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:38,100
I just put it off.

1693
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:39,100
All right.

1694
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:42,220
So, uh, every week you jump in the vault and find a game that the kids should be playing

1695
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:43,220
this week.

1696
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:44,220
Dark soccer.

1697
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:45,220
What should the kids be playing this week?

1698
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:46,220
I think it's captain commando.

1699
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:47,220
Fuck yes.

1700
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:48,220
That game is awesome.

1701
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:49,220
Yes it is.

1702
01:18:49,220 --> 01:19:00,140
And what people may not realize is that captain commando was supposed to have been the mascot

1703
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:01,860
for Capcom during that particular period.

1704
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:02,860
There had been earlier incarnations of him that eventually worked into the character

1705
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:03,860
we had in the video game.

1706
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:04,860
Um, so it came out in 1991.

1707
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:14,860
It was a futuristic side school and beat him up and it was released on the CP system.

1708
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:20,900
Um, that was actually the 17th title in the CP system and he was conceived again as their

1709
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:24,180
spokesperson to use in the late eighties.

1710
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:28,220
So basically, um, you have four characters in this beat them up.

1711
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:31,740
You have captain commando, who is the leader of the team.

1712
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:36,420
Um, you have in the U S I'm going to give us things on the Japanese names.

1713
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:42,780
Mac the knife, who is also named Jannetty in the Japanese version, who is a mummy commando

1714
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:43,780
from outer space.

1715
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:48,660
Um, he has this spinning attack, he's pretty fun.

1716
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:53,620
And of course the U S name came after the song that's mac the knife.

1717
01:19:53,620 --> 01:20:01,300
Um, anyway, Genzu, the ninja who was called Shou in the Japanese version is a ninja, the

1718
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:08,140
successor to the Bushimiya Nippo, um, who actually that same style was used by guy in

1719
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:09,140
final fight.

1720
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:10,860
So there you go.

1721
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:16,780
Um, and then baby head, also known as Hoover, uh, Hoover.

1722
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:22,660
Basically baby commando is a genius infant who fights in a robot that he designed.

1723
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:32,420
Um, he has knee rockets, that's all you need to know, but he's a baby driving a mecha.

1724
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:35,380
So anyway, it is basically, it plays a lot like final fight.

1725
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:39,620
It is a beat them up, you have up to four players at the same time.

1726
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:44,620
You can choose any of the four commandos and you know, each person has a different one.

1727
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:49,100
So, um, the control configuration is just like final fight with an eight-way joystick.

1728
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:55,100
Um, you can move left or right or toward or away and the buttons for attacking ninja.

1729
01:20:55,100 --> 01:21:00,420
Um, you also can pick up health restoring items, you can pick up, you can beat up destructible

1730
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:05,820
objects and you can get bonus items and weapons.

1731
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:13,460
So yeah, uh, the early, uh, captain commando looked like he honestly looked like he was

1732
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:14,460
from the seventies.

1733
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:20,300
He had like white flowing hair and gold chains around his neck and this disco looking outfit.

1734
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:28,460
And then later on in the eighties he looked like, you know, the eighties spaceman.

1735
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:32,220
Some fricking in-stream ad popped up and I didn't even notice it.

1736
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,220
You need to put it on the ad blocker.

1737
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:38,220
They don't always work anymore.

1738
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,220
Anyway.

1739
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:46,740
But anyway, um, many of Capcom's early titles in the NES featured, um, captain commando

1740
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:54,340
on it between 1986 and 1989, um, 1942 commando, ghost and goblins, mega man, Trojan section

1741
01:21:54,340 --> 01:22:00,940
Z and gun smoke, um, all released as part of the cap captain commando challenge series

1742
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:08,340
and had him on the back of the packaging in his futuristic space hero ray gun outfit with

1743
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:13,780
his medallion that said, you know, see on each of them, very disco.

1744
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:19,180
And then, um, the revised version of the one that looked, you know, more like a comic,

1745
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:25,500
you know, it was almost like a GI Joe character, but futuristic, um, was in the 1989 lineup,

1746
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:28,620
like strider, mega man, two willow and duck tales.

1747
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:32,900
Um, so that's the pilot suit fighter jet style.

1748
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:40,980
Um, and there was also a message on the artwork that said to the reader to look, look to him

1749
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:48,740
for up to date reports for all exciting action games from Capcom and including this feature.

1750
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:54,740
So other releases of captain commando we had, um, on the super nest, it came out in 1995.

1751
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:59,300
It's only a two player one and shows fewer enemies, uh, on screen and doesn't have the

1752
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:00,300
mech suit.

1753
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:02,060
Um, it also is censored.

1754
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:08,940
The PlayStation report came out in Japan on September 17th, 1998 by new ink.

1755
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:13,380
Has up to three players with a multiplayer, using a multiplayer adapter.

1756
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:19,980
Um, then we also had, uh, the CPS game, the full original version and Capcom classics

1757
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:25,820
collection remix for PSP and Capcom's Capcom classics collection volume two for PS2 and

1758
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:27,740
Xbox in 2006.

1759
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:29,460
They were going to do a Sega CD version.

1760
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:31,620
It was announced, but never released.

1761
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:32,620
It was canceled.

1762
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:38,740
As for the captain himself, he was a playable character in Marvel versus Capcom.

1763
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:44,260
And um, that was in 1998 and he had a transformation sequence that had him going from a cowboy

1764
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:46,380
outfit before going to superhero.

1765
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:53,780
Um, he had his attacks from the game and his victory quotes are random Capcom trivia.

1766
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:59,500
Um, you know, as a tribute to his, you know, old stuff.

1767
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:06,180
Um, he was also in Marvel versus Capcom two, also in Capcom world two, Capcom cross, uh,

1768
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:12,180
sorry, NAMCO cross Capcom project X zone two and SNK versus Capcom card fighters flash.

1769
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:18,180
He was also in the Udon comics, um, a two volume manga that came out that was, uh, I'm

1770
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:20,580
sorry, translated and published by Udon.

1771
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:27,300
Um, but also the other thing is that the other commandos did show up in, in, uh, Marvel versus

1772
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:29,780
Capcom for one of his hyper combo finishes.

1773
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:36,660
So, um, the super Famicom game got a 21 out of 40 for Famicom sutin.

1774
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:41,780
Um, the arcade game was listed as one of the top 21 beat em up games by heavy.com.

1775
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:43,540
And there you go, captain commando.

1776
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:44,660
Awesome game.

1777
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:49,860
I used to go back as a, as a child because, you know, we used to go ride around on our

1778
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:54,740
bikes and then local, you know, town to go play the different arcade games that were

1779
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:55,060
everywhere.

1780
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:59,620
So they had, you know, of course the street fighter two at the seven 11, but there was

1781
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:05,940
a cafe that had captain commando and we'd go there and just play that all the way through

1782
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:06,820
when they get hamburger.

1783
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:08,260
I love that game.

1784
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:09,940
All right.

1785
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:10,340
There it is.

1786
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:11,380
Your classic game of the week.

1787
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:12,260
Captain commando.

1788
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:14,900
No, I never have.

1789
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:15,540
Believe it or not.

1790
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:17,300
Weren't the mechs that were in this one.

1791
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:21,060
Those also in mega man X as well, because I remember they had like different elemental

1792
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:22,260
mechs similar, you know?

1793
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:26,580
And what's interesting too is that even though I never played that game, I remember the captain

1794
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:30,820
captain commando being like the capcom mascot for like a real hot minute in like some of

1795
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:34,740
the early NES manuals on, uh, you know, bring it back, do it.

1796
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:37,060
Hey, Inti create.

1797
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:40,900
If Nintendo says no to Zelda, how about a new captain commando?

1798
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:42,740
Captain commando for smash.

1799
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:45,620
I'd be down for that shit.

1800
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:47,380
He was in Marvel versus capcom too.

1801
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:48,820
And it was fucking awesome.

1802
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:50,580
You know, I always used to play as captain commando.

1803
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:54,100
You know, the latest big rumors, of course, there's always going to be rumors about smash

1804
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:54,500
characters.

1805
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:58,340
So take it with a gigantic, take it with like the, all of the salt Luigi.

1806
01:25:58,340 --> 01:26:01,300
They're going to add Waluigi because everyone's been bitching about Waluigi.

1807
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:04,180
No, uh, apparently two more that are going to be revealed soon.

1808
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:05,700
Isabel, which makes sense.

1809
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:07,060
I mean, that one makes total sense.

1810
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:12,100
Like Isabel is the subject of many interesting memes in Japan, uh, and in here too.

1811
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,780
So Isabel would make a lot of sense.

1812
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:17,060
Simon Belmont, the other one, I guess that they're talking about.

1813
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:21,220
So he was in that, um, that Nintendo 64 smash game.

1814
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:22,340
So yeah, who knows?

1815
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:22,740
Who knows?

1816
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:26,420
Any of these first appearance in a smash game too, that, uh, I don't remember what it's

1817
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:29,060
called, but they also had optimus prime in that game.

1818
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:29,860
And that was awesome.

1819
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:32,980
Was it dream something TV?

1820
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:37,540
I don't remember the name of it, but I'm, I'm not going to hold my breath on any of

1821
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:39,140
these news or rumors in that too.

1822
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:41,460
Barbie for smash, Barbie for smash.

1823
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:42,180
Heck yeah.

1824
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:42,740
All right.

1825
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:46,260
Anyway, uh, we're gonna take a break while we contemplate all the characters we want

1826
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:47,060
to be in smash.

1827
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:49,140
When we come back, we have some rapid fire news.

1828
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:52,340
We're gonna talk about release dates, your emails and more stories.

1829
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:53,460
So don't go anywhere, folks.

1830
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:54,740
We will be right back.

1831
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:04,580
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight.

1832
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:12,580
Episode number 739 of our show already in progress for tonight, July 29th of 2018.

1833
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:14,660
We have some more news to get into.

1834
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:17,940
We're going to get into rapid fire news here shortly, but a dark soccer, I believe you're

1835
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:19,300
going to be taken off, right?

1836
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:19,780
Yeah.

1837
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:24,420
I, um, I actually spent most of yesterday with a headache at the event and then I came

1838
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:28,020
home with an even worse headache and it's been growing again today.

1839
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:33,460
So it's drive now and be safe to drive or sleep on your couch and not go to work tomorrow.

1840
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:37,780
So we can always stay on the couch if you need to, but I understand you want to, you

1841
01:27:37,780 --> 01:27:38,820
got to go home so you can go to work.

1842
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:39,540
So, all right.

1843
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:40,740
Well, thank you as always for being here.

1844
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:41,940
Any final thoughts for our listeners?

1845
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:46,420
Um, um, strawberry rhubarb pie is delicious.

1846
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:47,620
It is pretty delicious.

1847
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:48,500
I feel better.

1848
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:48,900
Okay.

1849
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:50,820
Also, it's so weird looking at you right now.

1850
01:27:51,380 --> 01:27:51,780
Why?

1851
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:54,660
With, with, without your, oh, without my beard.

1852
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:54,980
Yeah.

1853
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:58,660
It's been that way for like a month, but it's, it's, well, now that yesterday's very clean

1854
01:27:58,660 --> 01:27:59,140
right now.

1855
01:27:59,140 --> 01:27:59,220
Yeah.

1856
01:27:59,220 --> 01:27:59,780
Well, yeah.

1857
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:00,820
Cause I had to, yeah.

1858
01:28:00,820 --> 01:28:03,700
Cause I was kind of like, I would let it get a little scruffy and then be like, oh yeah,

1859
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:05,300
I got a little bit like you've waxed.

1860
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:07,860
No, I didn't, I didn't go that far.

1861
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:10,820
Um, so yesterday, and there's some Queens who wax.

1862
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:13,380
If you guys didn't know, I think I made this pretty clear.

1863
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:14,900
I did the production of clue.

1864
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:19,700
I played Mrs. Peacock and it all kind of ties into, if you know the movie in the, one of

1865
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:21,700
the endings, they go just like the Mounties.

1866
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:22,900
We always get our man.

1867
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:26,260
Mrs. Peacock was a man slap, you know, that thing.

1868
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:27,380
So that was the joke.

1869
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:27,860
Right.

1870
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:31,540
Uh, and I, I'd seen like a drag performance of his peacock like 10 years ago.

1871
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:33,140
And I always thought it was like the funniest thing I ever saw.

1872
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:36,100
So I was like, okay, I want to do it for this show, but I fully committed.

1873
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:37,460
So, you know, I shaved my face.

1874
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:38,340
So the red beard's gone.

1875
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:42,420
So I just shaved yesterday morning was probably when I last shaved.

1876
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:44,180
But then I don't know if you also notice, look at this.

1877
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:48,500
I shaved my legs because I tried to do the stocking trick, but it didn't work.

1878
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:52,980
So, um, and the stocking trick is that you wear multiple pairs of stockings, but just

1879
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:53,620
wasn't happening.

1880
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:57,860
But you'll notice I only shaved them up to here where the dress came down to.

1881
01:28:57,860 --> 01:28:59,860
I don't, you got to admit shaved legs.

1882
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:00,980
Do you feel pretty nice?

1883
01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:01,860
No, I hate it.

1884
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:02,260
Really?

1885
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:05,140
Really?

1886
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:05,540
I don't know.

1887
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:06,420
I don't know.

1888
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:10,260
I've never liked like stubble on my arms or my legs.

1889
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:11,380
I shaved my arms too.

1890
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:12,020
Yeah.

1891
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:13,940
And I don't like the way the wind feels.

1892
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:18,100
I did that as well, but I cheated a little bit because it didn't really grow all back

1893
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,140
when I did it two weeks ago.

1894
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:20,260
So I kind of kept that.

1895
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:21,860
And it's the same thing with my chest.

1896
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:25,060
Like I shaved it two weeks ago and it didn't grow back enough.

1897
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:27,460
So I kind of didn't redo it yesterday.

1898
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:32,340
So, but I mean, it's just, it's just a sensitivity thing for me.

1899
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:37,860
But if I'm gonna like not wear jeans, then I like for to not have hair to get caught

1900
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:38,900
in wind or anything.

1901
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:39,460
Yeah, no.

1902
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:41,780
And that's the weird thing now is wearing jeans.

1903
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:47,300
It's like I feel weird in this area where I see I like how that feels because it's like

1904
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:47,940
clean.

1905
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:53,460
But let the record show I am fully committed to my art because, you know, drag is not something

1906
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:54,260
I usually do.

1907
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:54,660
Okay.

1908
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:55,140
I know.

1909
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:59,540
I know if there's a lot of stereotypes out there that that's what all gay guys do for

1910
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:00,420
fun on Friday nights.

1911
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:01,300
That's so not true.

1912
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:02,420
Just being clear.

1913
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:05,620
But I did it for a performance for the laughs.

1914
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:08,340
And, you know, it seemed to go over really well.

1915
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:12,900
I got a lot of really positive feedback last night and just some really like nice, nice

1916
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:13,060
things.

1917
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:16,340
I was very impressed with your royal leg slant.

1918
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:17,460
Oh.

1919
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:18,260
The picture on the couch.

1920
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:18,580
Oh yeah.

1921
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:19,540
When I was sitting on the couch.

1922
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:21,300
Well, because my heels were, I don't know.

1923
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:24,580
But yes, I did the Rolex because she's not crossing her legs in the movie.

1924
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:24,820
Right.

1925
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:25,860
I remember when you shadow cast.

1926
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:30,260
But at the same time, I didn't want to show because I wasn't wearing much under that.

1927
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:31,220
Yeah.

1928
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:31,620
Dress.

1929
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:36,900
And I did not go that fully committed to my drag art.

1930
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:37,780
We'll leave it at that.

1931
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:40,660
For that era though, the movie was supposed to represent.

1932
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:46,100
However, it was considered a more wanton thing for a woman to cross her legs.

1933
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:46,420
Yeah.

1934
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:47,860
So that actually was period.

1935
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:48,500
Correct.

1936
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:49,140
So, okay.

1937
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:49,540
So yeah.

1938
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:50,260
So I did.

1939
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:55,060
So yeah, I did the whole like slanting instead so that you couldn't see up my dress perverts.

1940
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:56,260
You were like Princess Kate.

1941
01:30:56,260 --> 01:30:59,380
Well, especially, especially when you're on that stage elevated.

1942
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:01,620
So like your crotch is at eye level for everybody.

1943
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:03,940
Like I had to be very like thinking about that.

1944
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:08,980
And I felt, I felt kind of bad, bad for Yvette because Yvette dies on that billiard table.

1945
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:11,940
And it's like, you can see London and France.

1946
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:13,540
Now she was prepared for it.

1947
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:15,380
So she had enough.

1948
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:17,620
You weren't going to see nothing, but it was still, I was like.

1949
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:20,740
She should have either had frilly, frilly pantalant, you know.

1950
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:21,140
She did.

1951
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:24,580
Or really colorful underwear.

1952
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:27,140
No, she had, I told her to draw teeth on it, but.

1953
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:27,640
Yeah.

1954
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:29,700
She didn't.

1955
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:30,820
Anyway.

1956
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:31,140
All right.

1957
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:34,500
I'm going to go before the drugs wear off.

1958
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:35,140
Okay, good.

1959
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:35,300
Yeah.

1960
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:39,060
The chat is going bonds, double six says, OLR body hair episode.

1961
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:40,740
Hey, you know what?

1962
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:44,260
Every, everybody's, it's, it's the human body.

1963
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:46,820
There are people who have trouble though, growing hair.

1964
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:47,460
Sure.

1965
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:48,740
And I'm not one of those people.

1966
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:54,980
Well, I, I've, I had an ex who did not grow and, you know, I don't want to get into stereotypes,

1967
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:59,380
but it is just, uh, guys that are a hundred percent Asian.

1968
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:00,820
I've known some hairy Asian guys though.

1969
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:01,540
Yeah, that is true.

1970
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:01,940
That's true.

1971
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:06,020
But a lot of guys that are like a hundred percent Asian don't always grow it like as much.

1972
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:07,380
So, you know, it just depends.

1973
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:08,420
My friend had alopecia.

1974
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:09,700
Oh yeah.

1975
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:11,620
Well, I knew a friend who had trichotillomania.

1976
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:13,060
Well, I'm like, you know, that is right.

1977
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:14,660
A lot of dudes have alopecia on their heads.

1978
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:16,180
Where you pull your own hair.

1979
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:19,540
Oh no, no, I've heard of that.

1980
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:21,540
No, that's just called having children.

1981
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:27,460
No, like they'll pick out their arm hair or their eyebrow or their, um, eyelashes and

1982
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:29,540
they'll just, it's a nervous thing.

1983
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:33,380
I only do that to fight off my eyelashes because they're trying to attack my eyes.

1984
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:34,340
Same with my eyebrows.

1985
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:35,460
Well, you know, how about this?

1986
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:38,100
Uh, O-O-L-R, love your body no matter what.

1987
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:38,980
That's, that's what it is.

1988
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:40,020
Even with your manias.

1989
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:42,740
Uh, Bond's 006 says, O-L-R, so you're a teenager.

1990
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:45,140
All right, we need to move on.

1991
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:48,660
See, you'll start this field differently about the opposite sex and then.

1992
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:49,700
Or maybe not.

1993
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:53,220
Or you won't feel differently at all.

1994
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:54,180
You'll still be ace.

1995
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:57,940
You'll feel awkward.

1996
01:32:57,940 --> 01:32:59,060
Very awkward.

1997
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:01,860
No matter what, you're going to feel awkward.

1998
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:07,940
And your skin at the time where you want to look your best, your skin will look its worst.

1999
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:12,900
You will have a topographical map of the Himalayas on your face.

2000
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:17,060
And I know that people like to tell you that it gets better when it comes to things like

2001
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:19,140
that and for the most part, life does get better.

2002
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:22,100
When it comes to your skin, it's never going to get better.

2003
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:24,740
So that's why drugs exist.

2004
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:25,800
All right.

2005
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:28,180
Anyhow, let's move on.

2006
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:32,100
Thank you to our soccer for getting us on a 10-minute tangent about non-gaming related things.

2007
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:36,100
But let's get back into gaming and get into some rapid fire news.

2008
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:36,600
Loki.

2009
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:39,060
Yes, so this is pretty cool.

2010
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:41,380
And I've actually kind of looked at this game myself and bought it.

2011
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:46,100
So I bad on me, but, um, it's a really neat indie game.

2012
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:50,580
I know it was one that I was kind of interested in because it was a unity made game.

2013
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:55,300
But the hat and a hat in time, which has been out on several different platforms,

2014
01:33:55,300 --> 01:34:00,740
that PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One has finally sold 500,000 copies, which is great.

2015
01:34:00,740 --> 01:34:05,780
And it for those not familiar with the game, it's kind of like a 3D platform or akin to

2016
01:34:05,780 --> 01:34:07,860
like a Mario 64 or something like that.

2017
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:11,380
But it's cute and definitely worth checking out.

2018
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:12,580
I wish it was on the Switch.

2019
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:13,700
I would totally pick it up on the Switch.

2020
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:16,100
I guess I'll have to play it on the PlayStation 4.

2021
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:18,900
Yeah, I don't really know this game, so I'll have to check it out.

2022
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:20,020
Yeah, it looks really cool.

2023
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:21,220
So definitely check that out.

2024
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:28,660
The other one is Freeze Me, which is not this game, but it's similar to Mario 64.

2025
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:33,780
Anyways, and then, of course, as always, each month we have our free games.

2026
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:35,140
I'm not sure what PlayStation is.

2027
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:37,140
I checked and they didn't have the listing for it yet.

2028
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:40,740
But for the Microsoft side of things in August,

2029
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:46,980
we're going to be getting Forza Horizon 2 Standard 10th Anniversary Edition is going

2030
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:49,860
to be free August 1st, the 31st.

2031
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:55,860
And For Honor is going to be available from August 16th through September 15th.

2032
01:34:56,580 --> 01:35:03,380
And then on the Xbox 360 compatible games, we have Dead Space 3 and Disney's Epic Mickey 2.

2033
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:05,300
So interesting.

2034
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:06,100
That's pretty awesome.

2035
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:10,260
So Dead Space, first half of the month and Epic Mickey 2, second half of the month.

2036
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:12,580
To this day, I still hate the name Epic Mickey.

2037
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:14,120
Yeah.

2038
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:15,700
But that's all right.

2039
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,820
The game is supposed to be pretty decent, but I don't know.

2040
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:21,140
Yeah, I think the second game a lot of people kind of passed on,

2041
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:23,300
but I heard it was better than the first.

2042
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:27,060
I like the idea of like this twisted Magic Kingdom stuff.

2043
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:29,540
I wish they went more with that, but then, you know.

2044
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:31,860
Well, now many people have a chance to visit it.

2045
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:33,860
Act F says the second game was OK-ish.

2046
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:35,700
Well, maybe it's free.

2047
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:36,420
That's right.

2048
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:37,780
That's not an OK-ish price.

2049
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:39,060
Free with your subscription.

2050
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:39,380
Yeah.

2051
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:40,340
Yeah. All right.

2052
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:43,460
Anyway, I have a couple of stories with audio to go with it,

2053
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:45,620
including a story about WarioWare Gold.

2054
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:50,900
Apparently, I thought that WarioWare Gold was supposed to be like just a mix of like greatest

2055
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:53,620
hits, but apparently there's like newer stuff that showed up in it too.

2056
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:55,540
Some of the mini games have been redone.

2057
01:35:55,540 --> 01:35:56,740
And then there's this.

2058
01:35:56,740 --> 01:36:02,260
There is a mini game in it called Mutroid 2, Return of Sam-Meow.

2059
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:04,340
So that's right.

2060
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:09,220
It is a Metroid-ish type of game full of cats.

2061
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:09,940
Oh, I don't know.

2062
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:13,060
It's not really Metroid, but the music is sure Metroid.

2063
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:22,020
And you're this little cat with a gun and you're shooting all these little turtles

2064
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:24,340
as they're trying to get up to you.

2065
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:29,860
Anyway, I love it.

2066
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:30,180
I know.

2067
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:30,900
I love it too.

2068
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:33,540
Like I was like, well, I'm not going to buy this WarioWare game on 3DS.

2069
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:34,900
It's just a mix of all the old stuff.

2070
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:36,500
And now I'm like, God damn it.

2071
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:37,140
God damn it.

2072
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:41,940
They're really going to get me to do that when I thought I was out and pulling right back in.

2073
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:42,260
All right.

2074
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:49,060
Anyway, so speaking of audio related things, the Smash Brothers Ultimate page has been

2075
01:36:49,060 --> 01:36:52,100
revealing some of the new music that's going to be in the game.

2076
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:53,060
Get this.

2077
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:56,100
There is a new F-Zero arrangement in the game.

2078
01:36:56,740 --> 01:36:59,060
So that's awesome, but it gets better.

2079
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:05,620
Uh, Takunobu Mitsuyoshi is the musician behind this.

2080
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:06,900
Have you ever heard that name before?

2081
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:08,660
I'll give you a hint.

2082
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:10,020
He sang a song and it went like this.

2083
01:37:13,780 --> 01:37:17,060
So the Daytona guy is doing an F-Zero song.

2084
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:18,420
Are you fucking ready to hear this?

2085
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:20,260
I don't know if I am ever ready to hear this.

2086
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:21,220
You cannot handle this.

2087
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:28,740
Okay.

2088
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:31,060
And then he, when he gets in the seat, let me, let me move forward a little bit.

2089
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:32,820
He sings a little more in the second half of this clip.

2090
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:37,300
Come on.

2091
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:38,020
Get some more singing.

2092
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:42,580
Ah, this is such a good clip though.

2093
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:54,340
I'm okay with this.

2094
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:57,940
It's like things I didn't know I needed until I had them.

2095
01:37:59,860 --> 01:38:00,420
I love it.

2096
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:03,780
Anyway, so please, please more stuff like that.

2097
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:08,900
Like, you know, and one thing I think we tend to forget about the Smash Brothers game games,

2098
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:11,060
they never slack in the music department.

2099
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:12,660
They never slack in the music department.

2100
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:16,740
Can we get a new F-Zero game and then have the Daytona car as a special unlock?

2101
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:17,700
That'd be amazing.

2102
01:38:18,340 --> 01:38:18,980
Oh my God.

2103
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:22,020
Act Def says I want an F-Zero with this music.

2104
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:24,020
I want any type of F-Zero.

2105
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:24,740
And Act Def goes,

2106
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:30,740
Do you think if they're making arrangements of music that perhaps they are working on something?

2107
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:32,580
Or do they just do this for Smash?

2108
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:36,020
I feel like this is a Smash thing because the Smash thing is usually where you get like these

2109
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:38,340
big legendary artists to do like songs.

2110
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:39,140
But I don't know.

2111
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:39,540
We'll see.

2112
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:41,300
Well, since you're here.

2113
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:41,700
Yeah.

2114
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:42,180
Right.

2115
01:38:42,180 --> 01:38:42,980
You can hope.

2116
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:43,460
You can hope.

2117
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:44,980
Or as Fifth Dream in chat says,

2118
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:47,380
Perhaps.

2119
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:48,980
Since we just had a story about cats.

2120
01:38:48,980 --> 01:38:49,220
All right.

2121
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:49,540
Forget it.

2122
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:51,460
That should be a full fledged game right there.

2123
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:53,220
What else do we have, Loki?

2124
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:54,020
All right.

2125
01:38:54,020 --> 01:38:59,620
So remember that whole adaptive Xbox controller for, you know, accessibility and stuff like that?

2126
01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:03,140
So, of course, they went the extra mile of not only thinking about the

2127
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:07,060
accessibility of the controller, but the accessibility of the packaging.

2128
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:14,260
So they actually addressed the need of, you know, people that might be disabled

2129
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:15,460
with the packaging as well.

2130
01:39:15,460 --> 01:39:20,580
So they would be able to open the cardboard box with limited mobility and that type of thing.

2131
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:21,540
So that's pretty awesome.

2132
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:26,180
So they had this loop that you would be able to pull that would kind of help with

2133
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:31,860
opening the packaging on the box and stuff and to get the controller out of the box.

2134
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:34,660
You had another loop to pull and everything.

2135
01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:36,180
So that is pretty neat.

2136
01:39:37,060 --> 01:39:39,220
That they went that far as to think about packaging.

2137
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:39,700
Yeah.

2138
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:44,660
Like, I don't have challenges when it comes to opening packaging.

2139
01:39:44,660 --> 01:39:47,620
And, you know, even though sometimes the stuff that, you know,

2140
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:50,580
Unless it's in those fucking clam shells or yeah.

2141
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:53,780
But anyway, all that aside, like, I was looking at the unboxing of this.

2142
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:54,980
I'm like, that looks like fun.

2143
01:39:54,980 --> 01:39:57,380
That looks like to open that looks like kind of like fun.

2144
01:39:57,380 --> 01:39:59,540
You know, it's very, very different.

2145
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:00,900
So that's really cool.

2146
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:02,820
That's cool for everyone.

2147
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:07,700
But especially the fact that, you know, it helps differently abled folks is really cool.

2148
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:08,340
So, yeah.

2149
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:08,840
Neat.

2150
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:14,580
And the other thing, of course, is Homestar Runner is going to be getting its own board

2151
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:17,220
game thanks to a Kickstarter program.

2152
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:20,500
So they have, yeah, Homestar Runners.

2153
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:26,020
And it's an area control game which will allow up to two to six players work together to

2154
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:32,580
help a beefy armed dragon completely decimate a kingdom by using unique powers and items.

2155
01:40:32,580 --> 01:40:33,080
Awesome.

2156
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:35,460
So it's pretty awesome looking.

2157
01:40:36,980 --> 01:40:40,980
Apparently, they had a seventy five thousand dollar goal.

2158
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:43,540
They blew through that immediately.

2159
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:49,380
And right now, with three weeks left, they are over seven hundred fifty thousand dollars

2160
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:52,020
and onto stretch goals.

2161
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:54,500
So I had a feeling that would get funded pretty quick.

2162
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:56,580
So I'm glad that that turned out well.

2163
01:40:56,580 --> 01:40:58,100
Let's hope that it actually gets released.

2164
01:40:58,100 --> 01:41:00,260
Yeah, they're eight hundred forty four thousand right now.

2165
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:05,860
Let's just hope that everything goes well, because, you know, Kickstarter can be a little

2166
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:06,980
bit shady sometimes.

2167
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:11,140
Dr. C wants to remind you in our chair room that he does have a name.

2168
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:13,140
The name is Traktor.

2169
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:15,000
Right.

2170
01:41:15,940 --> 01:41:17,300
I think Loki just didn't want to say it.

2171
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:17,800
All right.

2172
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:21,620
Anyhow, we're going to get to some release dates here in just a moment.

2173
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:24,740
Looking at some other comments in chat over at live.vodka.org.com.

2174
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:26,740
Act Def says, yeah, they do this for Smash.

2175
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:28,900
They did a ton of arrangements for Brawl.

2176
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:30,500
Like this.

2177
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:32,100
So, yeah, I wouldn't get your hopes up.

2178
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:38,020
Loki, there's a whole new game coming for F-Zero, although I really, really wish it

2179
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:38,660
would be.

2180
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:42,260
But anyhow, what games are coming out that I will get to play Loki in the US?

2181
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:49,300
So in the US, we're going to get to play a game called Chasm, which is or I guess Chasm,

2182
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:53,220
which would be on PC, PlayStation 4 and the Vita.

2183
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:56,980
We have Code of Princess EX on the Nintendo Switch.

2184
01:41:57,700 --> 01:42:00,660
Titan Quest on the Nintendo Switch.

2185
01:42:00,660 --> 01:42:02,660
Yakuza 0 on PC.

2186
01:42:03,380 --> 01:42:07,300
This is the police on PC, Mac and Linux.

2187
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:07,780
Is it now?

2188
01:42:07,780 --> 01:42:08,180
Oh, I'm sorry.

2189
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:09,300
This is the police 2.

2190
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:11,060
It's the sequel.

2191
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:13,300
I didn't know there was a this is the police war was.

2192
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:14,580
Yes, I remember it.

2193
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:17,860
And then finally, WarioWare Gold on the 3DS.

2194
01:42:17,860 --> 01:42:18,980
So you can play Mutroid.

2195
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:21,220
Yes, that's really the only reason.

2196
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:22,500
Well, that is WarioWare.

2197
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:23,060
It's amazing.

2198
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:26,740
Why it's not on the Switch for no reason whatsoever.

2199
01:42:27,380 --> 01:42:27,860
I don't know.

2200
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:28,980
All right.

2201
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:31,700
Well, heading over to Japan and then maybe you could fill in with the UK dates.

2202
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:36,260
And so Jimmy, I believe going over to Japan, checking out the releases there on the PlayStation

2203
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:41,220
4 on August 2nd, Friday the 13th, the game gets released in Japan, which seems a bummer.

2204
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:44,180
It's probably a little late over there in Japan because the game is not really going

2205
01:42:44,180 --> 01:42:45,460
to be getting supported anymore.

2206
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:49,140
I guess they ran into some issues with the movie and stuff, which which kind of sucks

2207
01:42:49,140 --> 01:42:52,420
because the game was like like everybody was fucking playing that when it was first out.

2208
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:53,140
It was a lot of fun.

2209
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:55,780
And then it just it kind of died off like real quick.

2210
01:42:55,780 --> 01:43:00,420
So it's I'm kind of bummed that that game had such inertia behind it and they kind of

2211
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:01,380
dropped the ball.

2212
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:04,580
And I think a lot of it has to I don't I don't necessarily think it's the developer's fault.

2213
01:43:04,580 --> 01:43:08,180
I think it just has to spin off with more horror.

2214
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:13,060
I know they should make just they should just make their own horror thing game that just

2215
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:15,380
doesn't even use the Friday the 13th characters.

2216
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:20,580
And if they just put by the makers of Friday the 13th game, people will people will check

2217
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:22,580
out like make new characters.

2218
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:26,420
And you can even have different characters that people could play as it would be different

2219
01:43:26,420 --> 01:43:27,620
abilities or multiple.

2220
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:33,140
I don't think like any of the campers are based off of real people, except for the one

2221
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:35,860
that you revive, one of the players to bring back like that.

2222
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:36,900
I can't remember who that was.

2223
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:38,740
It's from like Friday, 13th, part three or something.

2224
01:43:38,740 --> 01:43:42,260
There's there's like I don't think the kids are.

2225
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:44,740
Yeah, they're generic.

2226
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:46,020
All right.

2227
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:47,780
Anyway, let's see.

2228
01:43:47,780 --> 01:43:50,900
Going to other comments or sorry, not other comments, but other games that are releasing

2229
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:52,100
on the PlayStation for Japan.

2230
01:43:52,740 --> 01:43:58,740
Saga Scarlet Grace is out on August 2nd in Japan, as well as a game called Border Break

2231
01:43:58,740 --> 01:44:00,660
is out from Sega in Japan.

2232
01:44:00,660 --> 01:44:05,220
There's also a bunch of PS4 with the Border Break in them.

2233
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:10,020
So I guess Border Break is a big enough game to be getting different PlayStations with

2234
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:10,520
it.

2235
01:44:10,980 --> 01:44:16,020
I'm not super familiar with the series, but it's by Sega and it's 10 versus 10 high speed

2236
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:17,940
robot battles is what this game is.

2237
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:19,220
This is more up your alley, Loki.

2238
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:20,900
It looks cool.

2239
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:23,220
I don't know what it is.

2240
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:24,980
Yeah, I want to know what it is.

2241
01:44:24,980 --> 01:44:26,420
You may have to look.

2242
01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:27,940
Yeah, it looks pretty bad ass.

2243
01:44:27,940 --> 01:44:31,300
I mean, you know, screenshots look pretty sweet.

2244
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:34,340
And if you have yet to jump on Monster Hunter World, good news.

2245
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:37,380
It's moving into like the best hits already.

2246
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:38,660
It seems really fast.

2247
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:40,500
But that means a price reduction over there in Japan.

2248
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:46,820
It looks like either like a virtual on or like armored core almost.

2249
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:48,580
I'm not down.

2250
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:49,940
Man, is this coming over here?

2251
01:44:49,940 --> 01:44:51,060
I don't know.

2252
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:55,540
Going to the switch, that saga Scarlet Grace is also out on the switch.

2253
01:44:55,540 --> 01:45:01,300
Otherwise, you also have pro Yaku Famista Evolution and Lego The Incredibles gets its

2254
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:02,260
release over there.

2255
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:06,340
There's also some different accessories with Mario's face and stuff on them.

2256
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:08,660
If that is your sort of it was an arcade game.

2257
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:10,580
That's why I recognize it.

2258
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:11,080
Got it.

2259
01:45:11,860 --> 01:45:12,340
Okay.

2260
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:13,940
How about the UK, Loki?

2261
01:45:13,940 --> 01:45:14,260
All right.

2262
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:15,700
UK is not getting a whole ton of stuff.

2263
01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:20,580
They're getting Titan Quest as well on the switch and Hello Neighbor on the switch and

2264
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:22,580
on PlayStation four.

2265
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:23,780
And that's unfortunately it.

2266
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:26,100
All right.

2267
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:30,900
Well, let's go to the mailbag because every week you guys send us emails and we read some

2268
01:45:30,900 --> 01:45:32,100
of our favorites here on the show.

2269
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:35,860
If you want to email us, I encourage you to do so.

2270
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:40,180
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2271
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:42,660
And we do have one email in the mailbag tonight.

2272
01:45:42,660 --> 01:45:44,020
It's nice to hear from some folks.

2273
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:46,020
One email in the mailbag tonight.

2274
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:50,980
And tonight's email comes to us courtesy of Frodo Swagons, who emails us the following.

2275
01:45:51,540 --> 01:45:54,740
Rob, I was watching your stream this week of No Man's Sky.

2276
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:55,140
Thank you.

2277
01:45:55,140 --> 01:45:56,660
I recognize the name from the stream.

2278
01:45:56,660 --> 01:45:57,460
Thank you.

2279
01:45:57,460 --> 01:46:01,460
I know you'll probably mention it in your gaming week, but I was curious to know what

2280
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:02,900
you think of the update.

2281
01:46:03,460 --> 01:46:06,420
Um, I, is it something you will continue to play?

2282
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:08,580
Also, I was wondering about the multiplayer.

2283
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:12,260
I know you can have up to four people in your game, but I can't understand what the point

2284
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:16,820
is in naming a creature that you discover or making your base discoverable for other

2285
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:18,980
players when it seems to be invite only.

2286
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:22,900
How would anyone stumble across something of yours if it's not some type of mega server?

2287
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:24,660
I guess I'm a bit confused there.

2288
01:46:24,660 --> 01:46:26,420
Weekly listener is a big mega server.

2289
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:27,300
Frodo Swagons.

2290
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:27,620
Yeah.

2291
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:32,100
And Frodo, I think I think that might be the misunderstanding there is that it is a mega

2292
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:32,500
server.

2293
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:38,420
You are connecting to, um, problem is it's such a vast universe that you probably won't

2294
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:39,060
run across.

2295
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:45,220
Um, the person that you're like, if I was trying to find Rob, you know, without actually

2296
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:48,660
joining his game or something like that, it would probably be very impossible for me to

2297
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:49,380
run across.

2298
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:53,540
There's ways to do it because Dungeon Buster got to us in his main game and I don't know

2299
01:46:53,540 --> 01:46:54,340
how he did it.

2300
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:58,260
Like if I was just casually playing the game, I wouldn't probably run across stuff.

2301
01:46:58,260 --> 01:46:58,740
No, no.

2302
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:03,460
Well, and I think that was the whole reason why the developers kind of thought maybe they

2303
01:47:03,460 --> 01:47:06,180
didn't need multiplayer in the beginning is they're like, the universe is too huge.

2304
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:08,740
You're never going to run into other people because there's too many places to be.

2305
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:13,460
But I do know when I did play the first version of the game, it took me a little while.

2306
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:18,820
Um, but I transported like, you know, I went like 10 jumps, 10 different galaxies in and

2307
01:47:18,820 --> 01:47:21,860
I got to a galaxy that somebody else had named.

2308
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:25,060
So I saw there and I think they kept the default name or whatever.

2309
01:47:25,060 --> 01:47:27,220
Like a lot of people just keep the default names.

2310
01:47:27,220 --> 01:47:31,300
But I saw this guy's name and it said it was credited.

2311
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:36,260
It was discovered by and then whoever the gamer tag was on PlayStation four.

2312
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:43,620
Um, so in the case of like Planet Blissey that I named, if some rando comes across that

2313
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:45,940
universe, they're going to see Planet Blissey.

2314
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:48,020
Uh, and so they'll be like, Blissey, what is this?

2315
01:47:48,020 --> 01:47:48,580
So they'll know.

2316
01:47:48,580 --> 01:47:50,740
Well, they'll see my name that I'm the one that discovered it.

2317
01:47:50,740 --> 01:47:52,020
So they'll land in there.

2318
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:55,940
And then of course the universe Bobby Black Wolf named is a Voglandia.

2319
01:47:55,940 --> 01:47:57,460
I think that was a Voglandia.

2320
01:47:57,460 --> 01:48:01,140
So, um, you know, people are going to see right away that people have been here before

2321
01:48:01,140 --> 01:48:04,180
and that's going to be, um, your first hint.

2322
01:48:04,180 --> 01:48:09,700
Now in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says it's from when you start

2323
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:14,340
the game, you can choose to start your own game or join a friends if they are online.

2324
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:17,220
So, but, but aren't you starting a new game when you do that Dungeon Buster?

2325
01:48:17,220 --> 01:48:20,180
Or can you take like your old data and move to the new one?

2326
01:48:20,180 --> 01:48:20,660
I don't know.

2327
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:26,020
But when you do play online, um, you can, yeah, you, you will basically start in the

2328
01:48:26,020 --> 01:48:28,980
universe that your friends started in.

2329
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:31,060
And that's what we kind of learned was happening.

2330
01:48:31,060 --> 01:48:35,300
Like by the time I went to Planet Blissey, which was a different planet in the system,

2331
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:39,700
more people were joining the game like, uh, Bobby Black Wolf, like my friend Neil.

2332
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:44,340
And they started in the exact same place I did on the starting planet.

2333
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:48,260
And they figured it out because I had named one of the creatures Kitty.

2334
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:50,900
Because it was this adorable little thing that was walking around.

2335
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:53,380
I just got kitty because that's Alan does that.

2336
01:48:53,380 --> 01:48:56,100
Sometimes whenever he sees like a thing, he'll go kitty.

2337
01:48:56,100 --> 01:49:00,820
Um, so I named it kitty and Bobby, when he started his game, he's like, oh, I am where

2338
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:03,460
you started because there's a lot of the resources aren't here.

2339
01:49:03,460 --> 01:49:04,500
And I just found kitty.

2340
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:08,420
So, uh, it's kind of interesting how that worked.

2341
01:49:08,420 --> 01:49:09,380
So, uh, okay.

2342
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:13,940
Dungeon Buster says I saved my game and went back to choose friends lobby and zoom.

2343
01:49:13,940 --> 01:49:15,140
I made it to Blissey.

2344
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:15,780
Interesting.

2345
01:49:15,780 --> 01:49:16,420
Okay.

2346
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:17,780
So there's ways to do it.

2347
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:22,980
Um, the one thing I did think was interesting about the online though, and something I wish

2348
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:23,540
they'd change.

2349
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:31,060
When you do play online, meaning the multiplayer stuff, I believe the naming is always going

2350
01:49:31,060 --> 01:49:31,540
to be there.

2351
01:49:31,540 --> 01:49:36,340
But if you want people to be able to find you and all that stuff, uh, you can, uh, opt

2352
01:49:36,340 --> 01:49:37,380
to play online.

2353
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:40,740
But when you do that, anyone can join your game.

2354
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:41,220
Anyone.

2355
01:49:42,180 --> 01:49:46,980
There is no setting for friends only like most games have.

2356
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:51,220
That would be my one feedback for hello games that I think is a really obvious thing that

2357
01:49:51,220 --> 01:49:55,700
they left out is I would really like to have a mode where friends only can come into my

2358
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:58,580
solar system because I was playing the game.

2359
01:49:58,580 --> 01:50:04,100
And I think in the very first stream I did, I was playing the game and some Rando joined.

2360
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:07,860
And at this point I already left the home planet and I really had no interest in going

2361
01:50:07,860 --> 01:50:09,540
back to go meet some Rando.

2362
01:50:09,540 --> 01:50:11,300
So I was just like, whatever, dude, you're on your own.

2363
01:50:11,940 --> 01:50:16,820
I'm curious if that Rando stayed with it or what they did, because it would be very

2364
01:50:16,820 --> 01:50:21,540
interesting to see if maybe he didn't figure out that Blissey was a great planet.

2365
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:24,100
Maybe he tried to establish a presence somewhere else.

2366
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:27,140
Or if when I left the game, he was like, fuck that guy and just left.

2367
01:50:27,140 --> 01:50:27,620
I don't know.

2368
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:28,500
Who knows?

2369
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:34,580
So anyway, um, dungeon buster continues, uh, getting back to my universe.

2370
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:36,020
That was kind of messy after you left.

2371
01:50:36,020 --> 01:50:40,580
I tried using the gate from the space station in your system and ended up in empty space

2372
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:41,940
killed by cosmic rays.

2373
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:42,500
Wow.

2374
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:43,700
I kept all my stuff.

2375
01:50:43,700 --> 01:50:46,180
It was just as if I jumped to a new system.

2376
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:48,340
Only you and Black Wolf were there.

2377
01:50:48,340 --> 01:50:48,980
Interesting.

2378
01:50:50,260 --> 01:50:51,620
I kind of think that's interesting.

2379
01:50:51,620 --> 01:50:54,900
So you can kind of take your data and move it to other games wherever you want.

2380
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:55,940
Well, that's kind of neat.

2381
01:50:55,940 --> 01:51:00,020
So, uh, I do know also they have that galactic map online.

2382
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:05,780
So theoretically, if I could figure out how to give you the coordinates of Voglandia,

2383
01:51:05,780 --> 01:51:10,020
then you could look it up on this galactic map and you'd be able to see everything we're

2384
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:10,420
doing there.

2385
01:51:10,420 --> 01:51:12,980
I don't, I don't know what all the galactic map tells you.

2386
01:51:12,980 --> 01:51:14,660
I guess we're still trying to figure some of that out.

2387
01:51:15,220 --> 01:51:16,340
So we'll see.

2388
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:22,180
Uh, dungeon buster in chat says you can only invite friends, but so far you can't restrict

2389
01:51:22,180 --> 01:51:23,940
it to only friends.

2390
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:29,140
So, uh, Kaijuto says, sorry, the universe is for all friends only is too secluded for

2391
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:29,620
my taste.

2392
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:32,180
You're changing it though, Kaijuto.

2393
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:37,540
The universe is still open to all everything you name and all that stuff still changes

2394
01:51:37,540 --> 01:51:38,420
it with all.

2395
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:42,580
The thing is, is that if you don't want to necessarily adventure with other people, then,

2396
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:46,660
you know, I think you should be able to turn it off because the resources you gather, the

2397
01:51:46,660 --> 01:51:49,060
stuff you do, that does impact the planet.

2398
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:52,580
So I could see how like people might lightly troll, but I don't think you'd really troll

2399
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:54,580
anybody that bad in the game.

2400
01:51:54,580 --> 01:51:58,340
But I just, you know, with voice chat and everything, I don't need somebody joining

2401
01:51:58,340 --> 01:52:01,060
my game going, you know, F F F F.

2402
01:52:01,060 --> 01:52:05,220
Well, have we gotten like, can't you buy like big freighters and stuff like that in this

2403
01:52:05,220 --> 01:52:06,100
game now?

2404
01:52:06,100 --> 01:52:07,700
I haven't gotten that far yet.

2405
01:52:07,700 --> 01:52:08,580
Cause that'd be cool.

2406
01:52:08,580 --> 01:52:12,340
I don't even have my fucking like warp drive to go to another universe built yet, but I'm

2407
01:52:12,340 --> 01:52:13,940
not in a hurry to leave my current universe.

2408
01:52:13,940 --> 01:52:14,900
You know what I mean?

2409
01:52:14,900 --> 01:52:16,740
That's kind of go back and play.

2410
01:52:16,740 --> 01:52:19,540
You should, if you bought the game, check it out with the update.

2411
01:52:19,540 --> 01:52:20,580
You don't have to pay for it.

2412
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:22,660
So then you downloaded it again.

2413
01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:24,660
I know I downloaded it again when I got my new system.

2414
01:52:24,660 --> 01:52:26,420
It's a nine gig update though.

2415
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:27,380
Be careful.

2416
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:28,420
It's going to take you a time.

2417
01:52:29,060 --> 01:52:29,460
All right.

2418
01:52:29,460 --> 01:52:30,820
Oh, well, my games already update.

2419
01:52:30,820 --> 01:52:33,540
They update, um, cause I keep everything in sleep mode.

2420
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:34,740
So it updates automatically.

2421
01:52:34,740 --> 01:52:35,140
Oh, good.

2422
01:52:35,140 --> 01:52:38,420
So when I go in there, uh, Bobby does point out if you're joining, if they're joining

2423
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:39,860
your game, you can mute and kick them.

2424
01:52:39,860 --> 01:52:41,060
Oh, that's good to know about trolls.

2425
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:45,220
Uh, watch out though, a PlayStation four, if you haven't played it in a while, PS4 won't

2426
01:52:45,220 --> 01:52:46,100
keep updating it.

2427
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:49,700
So if you haven't launched it in like over two months, PS4 is not going to update it

2428
01:52:49,700 --> 01:52:50,340
automatically.

2429
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:51,780
Well, I just downloaded it again.

2430
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:55,140
So I would think it would try to then, then you should be fine.

2431
01:52:55,140 --> 01:52:57,940
I mean, it wasn't like this week that I downloaded.

2432
01:52:57,940 --> 01:52:59,940
I downloaded it a couple of weeks ago.

2433
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:00,820
Uh, you should be fine.

2434
01:53:00,820 --> 01:53:02,340
I think it was in the last 30 or 60 days.

2435
01:53:02,340 --> 01:53:02,900
Should be fine.

2436
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:03,620
All right.

2437
01:53:03,620 --> 01:53:06,260
Anyway, uh, do that was it for the mailbag.

2438
01:53:06,260 --> 01:53:07,380
Thank you very much for the email.

2439
01:53:07,380 --> 01:53:07,940
Appreciate that.

2440
01:53:08,020 --> 01:53:12,180
And again, if you guys want to email us in a future week, participate at orange lounge

2441
01:53:12,180 --> 01:53:14,340
radio.com is the place to send those emails.

2442
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:16,980
In the meantime, we have a few more stories for you guys that we're going to open up the

2443
01:53:16,980 --> 01:53:21,140
Skype line at orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype, but first Loki.

2444
01:53:21,140 --> 01:53:28,500
So apparently a hacker that was, um, he was arrested for cracking de Novo's anti pirate,

2445
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:30,900
um, piracy software.

2446
01:53:31,700 --> 01:53:42,660
So apparently there, this guy in Bulgaria named, um, boxy, he broke through, I guess

2447
01:53:42,660 --> 01:53:48,740
the, their cracking, um, software and was able to crack de Novo.

2448
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:51,780
And so with that, I guess I got him a little bit of attention.

2449
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:58,340
And so he has been arrested and basically said it finally happened.

2450
01:53:58,340 --> 01:54:00,180
I can't say it wasn't expected.

2451
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:05,620
Police came yesterday and took the server PC and my personal PC.

2452
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:08,660
I had to go to the police afterwards and explain myself.

2453
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:09,160
Wow.

2454
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:18,020
Apparently they said, you know, that the parent company of de Novo, um, or or dito.

2455
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:24,420
And I guess the Bulgarian cyber crime units, uh, were, had an investigation into him and

2456
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:29,140
says, uh, the swift action of the Bulgarian police on this matter shows that the power

2457
01:54:29,140 --> 01:54:33,460
of collaboration between law enforcement and technology providers and that piracy is

2458
01:54:33,460 --> 01:54:36,180
a serious offense that will be acted upon.

2459
01:54:37,700 --> 01:54:42,580
Well, I mean, congratulations.

2460
01:54:42,580 --> 01:54:46,580
You caught somebody, but I, it's not going to stop hackers going to hack.

2461
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:47,300
It doesn't matter.

2462
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:51,540
Yeah, it's still, and especially if this is not popular, which I pretty sure de Novo is

2463
01:54:51,540 --> 01:54:53,060
not very popular from what I've heard.

2464
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:54,820
Uh, it's probably not going to stop it.

2465
01:54:54,820 --> 01:54:57,220
I'm not, I'm not defending piracy.

2466
01:54:57,220 --> 01:55:01,060
Like again, you know, like if you like something, you should pay money for it.

2467
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:06,820
And anti-piracy methods like this do suck when it affects the performance of the game.

2468
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:07,140
Right.

2469
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:10,980
When the anti-piracy gets too fucking out of hand though, I understand why people want

2470
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:12,340
to be able to just disable it.

2471
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:12,900
You know what I mean?

2472
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:16,900
I miss the days of just having to look something up in page four of the manual.

2473
01:55:17,860 --> 01:55:19,380
Give me the code on page four.

2474
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:20,500
All right.

2475
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:22,100
We all know why that doesn't really work though.

2476
01:55:22,980 --> 01:55:23,540
All right.

2477
01:55:23,540 --> 01:55:25,140
Because you could photocopy that stuff?

2478
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:26,500
Uh, some of them you couldn't.

2479
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:30,500
I remember when they started printing them on like that red paper that you can't photocopy,

2480
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:32,420
but now they just need PDF it.

2481
01:55:32,420 --> 01:55:33,940
Now you can scan it.

2482
01:55:33,940 --> 01:55:35,460
There's so much stuff you can do anyway.

2483
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:37,300
Uh, moving on.

2484
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:40,980
I know we don't usually talk about sports games on the show, but I think this one was

2485
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:44,660
worth noting because this is, it's one of those things where you go, wow, they're finally

2486
01:55:44,660 --> 01:55:45,940
doing this in 2018.

2487
01:55:45,940 --> 01:55:48,260
It seems like this should have been something that happened a lot sooner.

2488
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:54,100
But, uh, the newest, uh, EA basketball game that's on its way out, NBA live at 19, EA

2489
01:55:54,100 --> 01:55:58,820
has announced that, uh, you will be able to make female characters in create a player

2490
01:55:58,820 --> 01:56:03,700
mode finally, which is interesting because if I remember right, they added the WNBA last

2491
01:56:03,700 --> 01:56:04,420
year.

2492
01:56:04,420 --> 01:56:09,060
So, I mean, that was good, but now you can finally make a female avatar if you want.

2493
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:14,980
Cause they do, they do this whole, uh, like they do live run the one streets, world tour

2494
01:56:14,980 --> 01:56:15,700
live events.

2495
01:56:15,700 --> 01:56:17,860
They do a lot of like street basketball.

2496
01:56:17,860 --> 01:56:20,100
Like it's not all like just playing stuff in an arena, right?

2497
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:21,620
You do a lot of like street basketball and stuff.

2498
01:56:21,620 --> 01:56:23,060
So why shouldn't you know?

2499
01:56:23,060 --> 01:56:27,140
Well, I mean, honestly, in any of it, you should be able to play a woman, but I understand

2500
01:56:27,140 --> 01:56:32,020
that unfortunately the NBA doesn't totally reflect that now that women are like fully

2501
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:36,020
integrated in that they have the two separate leagues, but that's a whole nother Oprah.

2502
01:56:36,020 --> 01:56:38,820
But at least for like some of like the street ball and the stuff where it's just like, you

2503
01:56:38,820 --> 01:56:41,700
know, friends playing a game together, you can do whatever you want.

2504
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:42,740
So that's pretty cool.

2505
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:43,060
Yeah.

2506
01:56:43,060 --> 01:56:44,260
So yeah, very cool.

2507
01:56:44,260 --> 01:56:50,180
Um, also the new trailer that kind of showcases this, they actually got Candace Parker from

2508
01:56:50,180 --> 01:56:52,660
the Los Angeles Sparks to kind of be in the trailer.

2509
01:56:52,660 --> 01:56:56,820
So they're, you know, trying to get, um, um, you know, some of the, some of the WNBA a

2510
01:56:56,820 --> 01:56:58,580
little more involved with it, which is pretty cool.

2511
01:56:58,580 --> 01:57:02,180
And I, I think this story popped up in our discord server, which if you're not on our

2512
01:57:02,180 --> 01:57:05,140
discord, you should check that out over at vog network.com slash discord.

2513
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:06,660
We'll get the invite for you.

2514
01:57:06,660 --> 01:57:09,780
Um, and, uh, I think it came up when the story was posted.

2515
01:57:09,780 --> 01:57:13,940
I said, yeah, I mean, I, I, and I've said this before on the show, I was a fan of the

2516
01:57:13,940 --> 01:57:14,820
WNBA.

2517
01:57:14,820 --> 01:57:17,620
I say was because we had a team here in Sacramento.

2518
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:18,420
Now we don't anymore.

2519
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:20,500
And it's like, it's not the same thing.

2520
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:22,260
We don't have like hometown games to go to.

2521
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:23,700
Sadly, I miss it.

2522
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:24,980
Anyway.

2523
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:27,620
Uh, looking in chat at live.vog network.com.

2524
01:57:27,620 --> 01:57:31,460
SSJ 100 map points out NHL also lets you make him play as women in the game.

2525
01:57:31,460 --> 01:57:32,260
Yup.

2526
01:57:32,260 --> 01:57:33,540
Uh, let's see.

2527
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:38,100
And, uh, dark Tetsuya says, I just thought this was a really cool story.

2528
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:41,380
Although NBA hang time does have it beat by about 20 years.

2529
01:57:41,380 --> 01:57:45,060
It also had create a player mode and buried it amongst the normal male heads and weird

2530
01:57:45,060 --> 01:57:45,940
costume heads.

2531
01:57:45,940 --> 01:57:47,380
There are a couple of female heads you could pick.

2532
01:57:47,940 --> 01:57:48,740
So pretty cool.

2533
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:49,780
All right.

2534
01:57:49,780 --> 01:57:50,900
Anyhow, let's move on.

2535
01:57:50,900 --> 01:57:52,900
Um, the next story was for dark soccer.

2536
01:57:52,900 --> 01:57:54,100
Maybe you can cover it, Logan.

2537
01:57:54,100 --> 01:57:54,420
Sure.

2538
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:54,900
Yeah.

2539
01:57:54,900 --> 01:58:01,780
Um, so Castlevania season two is coming to Netflix on October 26th and they had a pretty

2540
01:58:01,780 --> 01:58:07,060
cool trailer for that, but that's not all because a third season is already in the works

2541
01:58:07,060 --> 01:58:08,500
and should be coming.

2542
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:10,340
Well, I'm assuming afterwards.

2543
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:13,060
Um, I still have yet to watch the first season.

2544
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:14,420
It was on my thing.

2545
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:14,660
Yeah.

2546
01:58:14,660 --> 01:58:19,060
I wanted to, and I just didn't get around to it, but the second season looks awesome.

2547
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:24,100
And I guess I have some time to binge that, but, um, yeah, it looks pretty.

2548
01:58:24,100 --> 01:58:25,460
No, I still need to watch it too.

2549
01:58:25,460 --> 01:58:26,420
I'm so bad.

2550
01:58:26,420 --> 01:58:27,300
It looks good.

2551
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:27,620
Yeah.

2552
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:32,580
I mean, so I'm, I'm interested to check it out and obviously it's popular.

2553
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:34,100
You know, we're getting in a third season.

2554
01:58:34,660 --> 01:58:34,900
Yeah.

2555
01:58:34,900 --> 01:58:37,940
I haven't really heard negative stuff about it, so I think it's being pretty well received.

2556
01:58:37,940 --> 01:58:38,740
So that's cool.

2557
01:58:38,740 --> 01:58:39,220
Yeah.

2558
01:58:39,220 --> 01:58:39,860
All right.

2559
01:58:39,860 --> 01:58:41,140
So can't wait.

2560
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:41,620
All right.

2561
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:42,100
All right.

2562
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:48,180
And then something that I didn't necessarily ask for, but it's coming is a forsaken.

2563
01:58:48,180 --> 01:58:53,700
A HD remake of forsaken 20 years after the game came out.

2564
01:58:53,700 --> 01:58:58,980
So night dive studios, they were a developer that, um, I guess did HD updates for Turok

2565
01:58:58,980 --> 01:58:59,940
and Turok 2.

2566
01:59:00,740 --> 01:59:02,500
They're going to be doing this as well.

2567
01:59:03,140 --> 01:59:07,060
Forsaken was kind of a, it looked like a descent type game.

2568
01:59:07,060 --> 01:59:13,540
Um, basically, you know, they're going to be updating it with, you know, 60 FPS.

2569
01:59:13,540 --> 01:59:16,340
And of course, you know, higher resolution textures.

2570
01:59:16,340 --> 01:59:20,580
Although, I mean, this is a game that came out on place, the original PlayStation, Nintendo

2571
01:59:20,580 --> 01:59:21,140
64.

2572
01:59:21,140 --> 01:59:24,100
So it is a little bit, you know, low poly and that type of stuff.

2573
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:25,780
But it's interesting.

2574
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:30,820
I did watch the actual, um, trailer for it, but I don't know.

2575
01:59:30,820 --> 01:59:33,700
Um, and it's actually coming out very soon.

2576
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:37,300
It's going to be launching on, uh, July 31st.

2577
01:59:37,860 --> 01:59:41,780
So right around the corner, a couple of days if you're interested.

2578
01:59:41,780 --> 01:59:43,300
And that's on Xbox one and PC.

2579
01:59:45,540 --> 01:59:45,940
All right.

2580
01:59:45,940 --> 01:59:48,500
Was that the one that had the commercials that were like the future's forsaken?

2581
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:49,220
Was that that game?

2582
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:49,540
Yes.

2583
01:59:49,540 --> 01:59:50,100
Oh, my God.

2584
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:51,140
I remember that.

2585
01:59:51,140 --> 01:59:51,780
All right.

2586
01:59:51,780 --> 01:59:53,940
Uh, anyway, one more story for you guys.

2587
01:59:53,940 --> 01:59:55,300
Then we're going to open up the Skype line.

2588
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:56,420
So get ready to give us a call.

2589
01:59:56,420 --> 01:59:58,660
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2590
01:59:58,660 --> 02:00:02,740
And, uh, oh, gosh, you knew if you saw this story, you just knew we were saving the best

2591
02:00:02,740 --> 02:00:03,460
for last.

2592
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:04,100
That's right.

2593
02:00:04,100 --> 02:00:07,860
There is a porn, a Fortnite coming.

2594
02:00:07,860 --> 02:00:09,780
A Fortnite porn parody.

2595
02:00:09,780 --> 02:00:11,140
And you know what the game is?

2596
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:11,940
Excuse the game.

2597
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:13,700
You know what the porn parody is called?

2598
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:14,820
I'm sorry.

2599
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:17,140
I just laugh just looking at it on the screen.

2600
02:00:17,140 --> 02:00:17,860
You ready?

2601
02:00:17,860 --> 02:00:20,420
Loki, what would you call porn parody of Fortnite?

2602
02:00:20,420 --> 02:00:21,060
Fortnite?

2603
02:00:21,860 --> 02:00:24,820
Um, you would think fuck night, right?

2604
02:00:24,820 --> 02:00:25,460
Or something like that, right?

2605
02:00:25,460 --> 02:00:25,940
Yeah.

2606
02:00:25,940 --> 02:00:27,780
No, it's called Fortnut.

2607
02:00:31,780 --> 02:00:32,980
That's stupid.

2608
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:39,220
It's a joint production between Wood Rocket and Pornhub.

2609
02:00:39,220 --> 02:00:43,460
And I guess these people that are in this porn parody are semi-famous.

2610
02:00:43,460 --> 02:00:44,180
Sure.

2611
02:00:44,180 --> 02:00:48,100
And, uh, they have like a little colorful little thing going on here with this whole

2612
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:48,660
thing.

2613
02:00:48,660 --> 02:00:50,900
Anyway, there's an NSFW trailer.

2614
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:53,220
If you want to look it up on YouTube, I'm not going to play it here.

2615
02:00:53,220 --> 02:00:55,060
You can look it up on your own if you want.

2616
02:00:55,060 --> 02:00:56,820
Uh, so check it out.

2617
02:00:56,820 --> 02:01:01,460
Uh, and I guess there's a, one of the jokes goes, we need to find a chest.

2618
02:01:01,460 --> 02:01:04,500
And then the, uh, camera zooms in on the boobs.

2619
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:06,260
So that's, you know, high brow humor.

2620
02:01:06,260 --> 02:01:06,980
That's right.

2621
02:01:06,980 --> 02:01:07,940
That's right.

2622
02:01:07,940 --> 02:01:09,540
Anyway, uh, you can check that out.

2623
02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:11,140
I'm sure Pornhub has that available.

2624
02:01:11,140 --> 02:01:17,540
If you are interested in Fortnut, Fortnut, stupid.

2625
02:01:17,540 --> 02:01:18,660
I watched the trailer.

2626
02:01:18,660 --> 02:01:20,500
It was absolutely fucking terrible.

2627
02:01:21,060 --> 02:01:25,620
Like it was like, it was like a parody of what porn parodies are.

2628
02:01:25,620 --> 02:01:30,100
I mean, it's just, you're like, wow, that's some shit dialogue.

2629
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:32,180
Like just not even trying.

2630
02:01:32,180 --> 02:01:33,940
It's just like, fuck it.

2631
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:34,820
You know, whatever.

2632
02:01:35,940 --> 02:01:36,420
All right.

2633
02:01:36,420 --> 02:01:39,220
Uh, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2634
02:01:39,220 --> 02:01:42,660
If you would like to give us a call tonight to talk about anything we've talked about

2635
02:01:42,660 --> 02:01:44,580
or maybe have something else on the brain.

2636
02:01:44,580 --> 02:01:44,980
I don't know.

2637
02:01:44,980 --> 02:01:47,220
Anyway, the Skype line is open.

2638
02:01:47,220 --> 02:01:51,140
And while we wait for somebody to maybe drop in on the Skype line, let me check if there's

2639
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:51,940
any last minute stories.

2640
02:01:51,940 --> 02:01:53,700
I do have a last minute story.

2641
02:01:53,700 --> 02:01:54,740
It's amazing.

2642
02:01:55,300 --> 02:02:00,660
So there was a game that was created by Lucas arts not too long.

2643
02:02:00,660 --> 02:02:03,460
Well, actually it was pretty long ago called day of the tentacle.

2644
02:02:03,460 --> 02:02:03,940
Oh shit.

2645
02:02:03,940 --> 02:02:04,420
Yeah.

2646
02:02:04,420 --> 02:02:08,340
So there's a fan game now that is a sequel to that.

2647
02:02:09,780 --> 02:02:15,380
Call return of the tentacle and you can play it for free so you can check it out actually

2648
02:02:15,380 --> 02:02:18,500
at Katmik or Katmik.

2649
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:26,180
It's C A T M I C dot itch dot IO slash return dash of dash the dash tentacle.

2650
02:02:26,900 --> 02:02:32,100
And it is basically done in the style of the original point and click game.

2651
02:02:32,660 --> 02:02:38,500
And obviously the voice acting is kind of mimicked a little bit, but it's interesting.

2652
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:44,500
So I downloaded it before the cease and desist hits, but definitely go check it out because

2653
02:02:45,860 --> 02:02:47,940
I mean, I love those Lucas arts games.

2654
02:02:47,940 --> 02:02:48,440
Yeah.

2655
02:02:50,020 --> 02:02:54,020
Didn't they do like a modern remake of day of the tentacle a little bit ago?

2656
02:02:54,020 --> 02:02:54,180
Right.

2657
02:02:54,180 --> 02:02:57,460
Because I remember the one for the 80s and then they did like a newer one a few years.

2658
02:02:57,460 --> 02:02:57,620
Yeah.

2659
02:02:57,620 --> 02:02:59,380
The newer one was the day of the tentacle.

2660
02:02:59,380 --> 02:02:59,860
Yeah.

2661
02:02:59,860 --> 02:03:01,300
They updated the HD one.

2662
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:03,220
This is done in the style of the HD one.

2663
02:03:03,220 --> 02:03:03,460
Okay.

2664
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:03,700
Got it.

2665
02:03:03,700 --> 02:03:05,220
So it's still the point.

2666
02:03:05,220 --> 02:03:06,500
And it's all maniac mansion.

2667
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:09,060
It's all maniac mansion and guest characters.

2668
02:03:09,700 --> 02:03:13,380
There's there's cameos from other stuff in there too.

2669
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:13,940
Okay.

2670
02:03:13,940 --> 02:03:14,900
So cool.

2671
02:03:14,900 --> 02:03:15,400
Yeah.

2672
02:03:15,860 --> 02:03:16,180
Definitely.

2673
02:03:16,180 --> 02:03:16,900
We're checking it.

2674
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:17,780
Be looking forward to that.

2675
02:03:17,780 --> 02:03:19,220
I will have to play it.

2676
02:03:19,220 --> 02:03:19,620
All right.

2677
02:03:19,620 --> 02:03:20,660
I will have to as well.

2678
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:21,800
Okay.

2679
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:25,060
Well, I think, uh, I guess we're going to go ahead and wrap up.

2680
02:03:25,060 --> 02:03:27,220
Um, because I'm, I'm also, I'm so tired.

2681
02:03:27,220 --> 02:03:28,100
I'm really so exhausted.

2682
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:28,580
I'm ready.

2683
02:03:28,580 --> 02:03:30,820
I'm ready to just vegetate a little bit.

2684
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:31,860
I'm sure y'all understand.

2685
02:03:32,420 --> 02:03:36,340
But we'll be back, uh, next week to do it all over again in about seven days.

2686
02:03:36,340 --> 02:03:38,180
Uh, as I always say at the end of every episode,

2687
02:03:38,180 --> 02:03:41,380
if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, uh, please tell a friend or

2688
02:03:41,380 --> 02:03:44,580

2689
02:03:44,580 --> 02:03:48,900

2690
02:03:48,900 --> 02:03:54,820
Uh, so, uh, you can also, uh, send us an email, participate at orange lounge radio.com.

2691
02:03:54,820 --> 02:03:58,820

2692
02:03:58,820 --> 02:04:02,660
You can join our discord vog network.com slash discord.

2693
02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:06,260
Um, I guess that's, that's where I get to everybody's final thoughts.

2694
02:04:06,260 --> 02:04:09,140
So Loki, what's your final thought?

2695
02:04:09,140 --> 02:04:13,780
My final thought is I'm going to be still working on games in unreal.

2696
02:04:13,780 --> 02:04:20,020
Now I'm checking it out and seeing how that goes on my spawner screwed right now.

2697
02:04:20,020 --> 02:04:22,180
And we're just following along with the lesson.

2698
02:04:22,180 --> 02:04:23,700
So I don't really feel like I'm creating too much.

2699
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:25,940
Although I did like adapt some of it too.

2700
02:04:26,740 --> 02:04:30,180
It's just, and the gut, the artwork that's there is provided by somebody else.

2701
02:04:30,180 --> 02:04:31,140
So it's not that great.

2702
02:04:31,140 --> 02:04:35,540
I kind of redo everything from scratch, which is more of a learning something and learning

2703
02:04:35,540 --> 02:04:37,620
how unreal works and everything.

2704
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:43,060
So I'm looking forward to seeing how, uh, so that works cause it, I don't know.

2705
02:04:44,180 --> 02:04:49,380
I'll make my own thing later, but it I'm just making this, going through this lesson.

2706
02:04:50,340 --> 02:04:51,220
All right.

2707
02:04:51,220 --> 02:04:57,220
And, uh, my final thought tonight is, um, I'm, I'm ready to just go.

2708
02:04:57,220 --> 02:05:00,260
I actually, I need to take a little bit of a walk to get some steps in and get,

2709
02:05:00,260 --> 02:05:04,820
I haven't sent any pokey gifts today and Loki and I are about to become three star friends.

2710
02:05:05,060 --> 02:05:08,020
Like today, that's, that's a 50,000 experience bonus.

2711
02:05:08,020 --> 02:05:09,940
Uh, I actually hit three stars.

2712
02:05:09,940 --> 02:05:11,220
I hit three stars with a few people.

2713
02:05:11,220 --> 02:05:12,580
So it is 50,000?

2714
02:05:12,580 --> 02:05:14,180
It's 50,000 XP.

2715
02:05:14,180 --> 02:05:16,500
Oh, so you know, what's funny is the egg works on that.

2716
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:17,220
Yes, it does.

2717
02:05:17,220 --> 02:05:19,860
So I did that last time I got a hundred thousand from somebody.

2718
02:05:19,860 --> 02:05:22,020
And then I think best friends is a hundred.

2719
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:23,620
The four stars is a hundred thousand.

2720
02:05:23,620 --> 02:05:24,020
I think.

2721
02:05:24,020 --> 02:05:24,340
Cool.

2722
02:05:24,340 --> 02:05:25,060
I heard that's what it is.

2723
02:05:25,620 --> 02:05:27,220
Obviously it takes a while to hit that.

2724
02:05:27,220 --> 02:05:28,660
It's like 90 days to hit that.

2725
02:05:28,660 --> 02:05:34,100
But, uh, my friend, uh, up in Toronto is pro is the one that every single day,

2726
02:05:34,100 --> 02:05:36,260
since it started, we've traded gifts.

2727
02:05:36,260 --> 02:05:38,260
And so I hit three stars with him first.

2728
02:05:38,260 --> 02:05:40,340
And then the very next day, like act deft.

2729
02:05:40,340 --> 02:05:44,340
And I think, uh, as 200 Matt, like at the same time, we hit three stars.

2730
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:48,100
I've hit it with, um, act deft and with magma lemur.

2731
02:05:48,660 --> 02:05:49,460
Oh, cool.

2732
02:05:49,460 --> 02:05:49,860
Yes.

2733
02:05:49,860 --> 02:05:50,180
Yeah.

2734
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:50,740
Neat.

2735
02:05:50,740 --> 02:05:51,300
All right.

2736
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:55,620
Well, uh, I will try to get you a gift so we can hit three stars as well.

2737
02:05:55,620 --> 02:05:56,020
Anyway.

2738
02:05:56,020 --> 02:05:57,380
Um, that's it.

2739
02:05:57,380 --> 02:05:58,020
We're done.

2740
02:05:58,020 --> 02:05:58,580
