00:00.000 --> 00:17.720
In the year of the remaster I was pleasantly surprised to see Turok released on Steam and

00:17.720 --> 00:21.920
now the same company is bringing the N64 release of Forsaken back to PC and the Xbox One as

00:21.920 --> 00:22.920
well.

00:22.920 --> 00:25.800
Engage your six degrees of freedom and join us for another episode of the show where every

00:25.800 --> 00:29.800
gamer has a voice.

00:29.800 --> 00:34.880
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

00:34.880 --> 00:35.880
Welcome back.

00:35.880 --> 00:38.040
It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.040 --> 00:45.760
It's Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 739 for this July 29th of 2018.

00:45.760 --> 00:51.520
Oh my gosh, I can't believe August is almost here and then that means fall is around the

00:51.520 --> 00:55.400
corner and all the holiday games are around the corner.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.400
Crazy time.

00:56.400 --> 00:59.960
Anyway, I am Rob Roberts here to talk about video games and gaming culture, the gaming

00:59.960 --> 01:03.800
lifestyle with you here on the show with my co-hosts.

01:03.800 --> 01:07.600
Say hello as always to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:07.600 --> 01:08.600
Hi.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.600
Hi, how are you?

01:09.600 --> 01:10.600
I'm okay.

01:10.600 --> 01:11.600
Yeah?

01:11.600 --> 01:12.600
You were coming through quiet there for a minute.

01:12.600 --> 01:13.600
Yeah.

01:13.600 --> 01:14.600
We're good.

01:14.600 --> 01:15.600
We're good.

01:15.600 --> 01:16.600
Yesterday was a busy day.

01:16.600 --> 01:17.600
Yeah?

01:17.600 --> 01:18.600
Well, you went to California Stream, right?

01:18.600 --> 01:19.600
I did.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.600
You want to tell us a little bit about that?

01:21.600 --> 01:24.600
There were lots of video games, lots of noise.

01:24.600 --> 01:25.600
Yeah.

01:25.600 --> 01:31.280
Lots of lights, lots of headaches, which I still have a bit of one today, but I had

01:31.280 --> 01:32.280
a great time.

01:32.280 --> 01:36.760
I played a bunch of stuff and I'll talk about it when I talk about what I played, but there

01:36.760 --> 01:41.200
was a bit of a rarity there and that was a pop-in stage.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.400
Oh, is that the dancing thing?

01:43.400 --> 01:44.880
Yes, it is completely non-intuitive.

01:44.880 --> 01:47.160
Huh.

01:47.160 --> 01:48.960
I did not enjoy it.

01:48.960 --> 01:49.960
I don't think I've ever played that.

01:49.960 --> 01:52.560
I didn't even know they had one of those in the Bay Area.

01:52.560 --> 01:53.560
I love theater.

01:54.560 --> 01:57.160
That's kind of a newer game for California Extreme to have.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.160
You know what I mean?

01:58.160 --> 02:01.680
Yeah, it was really fun, but only like two songs that was kind of, I'm glad I didn't

02:01.680 --> 02:02.680
pay for it.

02:02.680 --> 02:03.680
Yeah.

02:03.680 --> 02:06.240
But I'll talk more about that in my gaming week.

02:06.240 --> 02:07.240
Sounds good.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.920
So for those that don't know, if you've never heard of it, California Stream is a big thing

02:09.920 --> 02:14.960
that they have here in the Bay Area where they basically fill a ballroom at a hotel

02:14.960 --> 02:19.840
with, it's supposed to be classic arcade games, but it sounds like they put a lot of contemporary

02:19.840 --> 02:20.840
stuff in there too.

02:20.840 --> 02:21.840
Especially-

02:21.840 --> 02:22.840
Oh, it's all across the spectrum.

02:23.520 --> 02:26.920
And old and new pinball because they had the Iron Maiden machines out.

02:26.920 --> 02:30.000
Because didn't it start as a pinball thing and then kind of grew into this other stuff

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
too?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
I don't know.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
It's been a long time.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
So, huh.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
All right.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Interesting.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Anyhow, I'm also joining us in studio.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.560
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:38.560 --> 02:39.560
Hello.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.560
How are you?

02:40.560 --> 02:41.560
I'm good.

02:41.560 --> 02:42.560
You were playing with wires down there.

02:42.560 --> 02:43.560
Everything okay?

02:43.560 --> 02:44.800
Well, yeah, because my laptop said it wasn't charging.

02:44.800 --> 02:45.800
I was like, oh, that's not good.

02:45.800 --> 02:46.800
That's weird.

02:46.800 --> 02:47.800
It's plugged in.

02:47.800 --> 02:48.800
You're going to need that.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.020
So apparently a cord is loose.

02:50.020 --> 02:51.680
No California Stream for you, sadly.

02:51.680 --> 02:52.680
No.

02:53.520 --> 02:56.400
I could have gone, but I had a big show last night.

02:56.400 --> 03:01.460
The clue on stage that I talked about a few previous weeks happened last night.

03:01.460 --> 03:04.660
So my week was obviously very busy preparing for that.

03:04.660 --> 03:09.440
And today I'm just in like, I left the house once.

03:09.440 --> 03:14.640
I left the house once today to walk up the street to go raid an Alola Marowak.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.720
That's the only time I've left the house today.

03:17.720 --> 03:20.080
And probably will be the only time I leave the house today.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.080
So anyway.

03:21.520 --> 03:25.680
But I would have loved to have gone to California Stream, except that it's always inevitably

03:25.680 --> 03:28.480
on some weekend where I have something else going on.

03:28.480 --> 03:29.480
Summer's a busy time.

03:29.480 --> 03:30.480
What can I say?

03:30.480 --> 03:32.040
I didn't even know it was this weekend.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.040
Yeah.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.040
Like it snuck up on me.

03:34.040 --> 03:38.280
I got a text from our buddy Melody just out of the blue.

03:38.280 --> 03:41.240
Like that was like, are you coming to California Stream?

03:41.240 --> 03:42.840
And I was, I think it was something like that.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.600
And I was like, oh, well, no clue is also tomorrow.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.840
So, and I was like, dang, I didn't even realize it was this weekend.

03:48.840 --> 03:49.840
Oh, well.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.680
I'm glad to hear it was a good show at least.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.320
And that fun was had by some people.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.280
It was good.

03:56.280 --> 03:57.280
Anyway.

03:57.280 --> 04:00.600
Um, so any exciting stuff going on in your week, Loki?

04:00.600 --> 04:03.840
Um, no, not really.

04:03.840 --> 04:07.240
I mean, just still working on unreal programming.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.240
Okay.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.240
Sticking with that.

04:09.240 --> 04:10.240
Been doing at least like a few hours a day.

04:10.240 --> 04:13.480
I saw some of your tweets that you're really liking some of like the, I guess, like templates

04:13.480 --> 04:14.480
and stuff that they do.

04:14.480 --> 04:17.960
Well, it's just like they have the way the engine's built because I mean, it's unreal

04:17.960 --> 04:18.960
engine.

04:19.080 --> 04:20.400
And you can use it for first person shooters.

04:20.400 --> 04:22.160
I mean, that's what they built it on.

04:22.160 --> 04:27.120
And so of course they have a lot of stuff built for shooter games.

04:27.120 --> 04:30.920
And so they have a lot of these things you would normally have to make all the time,

04:30.920 --> 04:36.160
like projectile scripts and stuff for different types of cameras for third person, you know,

04:36.160 --> 04:38.840
shooter cameras or first person shooter cameras.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.200
They have a lot of that built in them.

04:40.200 --> 04:44.800
Unity has some of that too, but I don't know, I kind of like the way that they set this

04:44.800 --> 04:45.800
up a little bit.

04:45.800 --> 04:51.600
And the hang of blueprints and kind of figuring out how that translates into normal code.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.320
Because there's a whole lot of like, I'm going to have to go through after I'm done with

04:54.320 --> 04:57.840
this, I'm going to have to go through a bunch of different blueprint courses that kind of

04:57.840 --> 05:02.600
learn all of the ins and outs of what it can do.

05:02.600 --> 05:06.840
Because there's a lot of features there, but I like it and I like how it makes everything

05:06.840 --> 05:10.560
easy to make look good, I guess.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.120
All right, cool.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.720
So does this mean your game is a first person shooter that you're making?

05:14.720 --> 05:15.720
No.

05:16.640 --> 05:19.360
I thought we thought we might have got some confirmation in there.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.360
I tried you guys.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.100
Anyway, let's go to our chat.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.160
Say hello to our chatters.

05:23.160 --> 05:27.880
We do, of course, tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,

05:27.880 --> 05:32.920
vognetwork.com, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf

05:32.920 --> 05:33.920
show.

05:33.920 --> 05:39.920
And you can chat along with us at live.vognetwork.com, where actf says Alola Marowak was worth it.

05:39.920 --> 05:44.120
I never thought I would be so excited to catch a Marowak, because I don't know about you

05:44.120 --> 05:47.880
guys, but like Cubones are like herpes here.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.020
They're everywhere, right?

05:49.020 --> 05:54.140
So I have tons of regular Marowaks, but the Alola Marowak is so cool with like the fire

05:54.140 --> 05:55.140
thing.

05:55.140 --> 05:56.540
And the only way you can get them right now is in raids.

05:56.540 --> 05:59.060
They didn't even put them in the eggs.

05:59.060 --> 06:04.320
So yeah, it was kind of worth it actually, even though it didn't end up highest appraisal.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.880
But I mean, how often do you actually battle with Marowak?

06:06.880 --> 06:07.880
Probably not very often.

06:07.880 --> 06:12.520
Sometimes, sometimes it's about putting cool stuff in gyms though, because I was able to

06:12.520 --> 06:18.880
get a Torque Hole from Shane, who is at the actual Go Fest or whatever they call it in

06:18.880 --> 06:20.680
Chicago, where they had a ton of them.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.320
So he brought me back a Torque Hole.

06:22.320 --> 06:25.800
So I just started putting Torque Hole in gyms around here, just so that people could get

06:25.800 --> 06:27.840
the Dex entry if they didn't already have it.

06:27.840 --> 06:32.680
So you know, kind of fun, even though they don't get the full, full entry without actually

06:32.680 --> 06:33.880
capturing a Torque Hole.

06:33.880 --> 06:38.840
So hopefully there'll be more opportunities to catch some of those things that are typically

06:38.840 --> 06:39.840
region locked.

06:39.840 --> 06:43.600
I know the only things I need now are region locked Mr. Mime and Kangaskhan.

06:43.600 --> 06:44.600
That's all I need.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.840
So I'm going to hope that maybe I can get some at Dragon Con because people come from

06:47.840 --> 06:49.520
all around the world to Dragon Con.

06:49.520 --> 06:52.160
So I'm hoping there'll be like a trading outpost or something where like maybe I could trade

06:52.160 --> 06:54.960
some Tauros, which is the exclusive here.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.760
But here's the other funny thing.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.120
I didn't mean to make this a Pokemon Go podcast, but deal with it.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.600
A lot of people were playing.

07:01.600 --> 07:07.920
On my flight back from Dragon Con this year, I go to the Austin airport and I believe Austin

07:07.920 --> 07:12.600
is far enough South where I can get Corrosola, I think.

07:12.600 --> 07:16.240
So I'm going to try to get one at the airport because I think I have a layover of like 90

07:16.240 --> 07:17.240
minutes.

07:17.240 --> 07:18.240
So everybody cross your fingers.

07:18.240 --> 07:22.920
Although I think, I think technically I think JD actually, when he was in Florida, brought

07:22.920 --> 07:27.000
back some stuff to trade, but it would be cool to catch one of my own and then I could

07:27.000 --> 07:29.280
get more to bring back to trade for some of the other people around here.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.280
So we'll see.

07:30.280 --> 07:31.280
We'll see.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.280
Anyway.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.920
Um, other comments and chat over at live.vognover.com.

07:34.920 --> 07:35.920
Okay.

07:35.920 --> 07:39.960
One more Pokemon comment here from SSG100Matt, who says I've not gotten a chance to get an

07:39.960 --> 07:40.960
Alolan Marowak.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.880
I did get an Alolan Raichu.

07:42.880 --> 07:47.760
It doesn't seem like the Marowak spawn very often, um, but, and you need, you need a group

07:47.760 --> 07:48.920
to do Marowak.

07:48.920 --> 07:52.280
You can solo Raichu if you're a higher level.

07:52.280 --> 07:55.400
I soloed it, but I only had like 12 seconds left on the clock.

07:55.400 --> 07:59.300
Uh, but I just used like the recommended Pokemon too, which aren't always the best.

07:59.300 --> 08:04.580
The recommended are usually more better defenders than attackers, but, um, I only, I did it

08:04.580 --> 08:05.580
with weather boost.

08:05.580 --> 08:07.700
I had like 12 seconds left, but I do, I was able to solo it.

08:07.700 --> 08:14.420
So you can solo Alolan Raichu, but if you can duo it for the insurance, it's probably

08:14.420 --> 08:15.700
a lot easier.

08:15.700 --> 08:16.700
All right.

08:16.700 --> 08:21.180
Anyway, uh, let's move on and talk about something that's an, I do love Pokemon Go, but I'm sure

08:21.180 --> 08:23.020
it's going to come up in gaming weeks too.

08:23.020 --> 08:26.540
Let's talk about some other games and a little story to kick us off.

08:26.540 --> 08:30.740
Uh, because we like it when video games, I don't know about you guys, but I like when

08:30.740 --> 08:34.700
I see video games represented kind of like in the mainstream stuff.

08:34.700 --> 08:38.660
Like not that, I don't think gaming necessarily needs that validation at this point because

08:38.660 --> 08:40.300
I know we've talked about it before.

08:40.300 --> 08:45.400
I think as you know, our generation is getting older, that sort of that, I really don't like

08:45.400 --> 08:49.500
to use the term Zillennial, but you know what I'm talking about?

08:49.500 --> 08:54.060
Like kind of that window right between generation X and millennial, right?

08:54.060 --> 08:59.060
Kind of like as that generation is getting older, like we all know video games.

08:59.060 --> 09:03.460
Like even if like you had friends that play video games or you know, people do video games.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.780
So it's not that we necessarily need the validation, but it's still kind of cool to see stuff on

09:06.780 --> 09:08.500
mainstream TV.

09:08.500 --> 09:14.200
So for example, uh, the Overwatch league had their finals on and we, we talked about this

09:14.200 --> 09:19.620
last week show, but the finals really were on ESPN, uh, this weekend and the London Spitfire

09:19.620 --> 09:20.620
won the whole thing.

09:20.620 --> 09:22.660
Um, and I know some people were really into that watching it.

09:22.660 --> 09:24.980
They had it at a huge arena, the Barclays arena.

09:24.980 --> 09:29.940
So they did it at a like more like an arena that would typically have like basketball

09:29.940 --> 09:30.940
and stuff.

09:30.940 --> 09:35.060
Um, instead of the custom one, that's basically a TV studio that Blizzard built, I'm a little

09:35.060 --> 09:36.420
closer to their home.

09:36.420 --> 09:39.620
So I mean, it's pretty cool to see that kind of validation.

09:39.620 --> 09:43.380
Um, but then this one, in my opinion, kind of came out of nowhere.

09:43.380 --> 09:48.540
Somebody tweeted this at me because I don't, I don't always watch this show, but, um, you

09:48.540 --> 09:53.060
guys ever watched America's Got Talent, that show it's been on for years now.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.700
It's on like it's 13 season or something.

09:54.700 --> 09:55.700
I don't know what you're talking.

09:55.700 --> 09:56.700
No.

09:56.700 --> 09:57.700
Yes.

09:57.700 --> 09:58.700
I've seen a show.

09:58.700 --> 09:59.700
Well, here's my, okay.

09:59.700 --> 10:04.020
I don't really watch America's Got Talent, but those videos from all those guys, cause

10:04.020 --> 10:06.740
no matter what country you live in, they have one of these shows, they have the Britain's

10:06.740 --> 10:07.740
Got Talent.

10:07.740 --> 10:08.740
They have, they have everything.

10:08.740 --> 10:12.100
Everybody's got talent, which is a talent filled world, right?

10:12.100 --> 10:15.080
So everybody has talent and nobody has talent.

10:15.080 --> 10:19.460
So these, these talent things show up all the time on Facebook because it will be like,

10:19.460 --> 10:21.700
look at this 11 year old girl that sings opera.

10:21.700 --> 10:22.700
So beautiful.

10:22.700 --> 10:25.900
Make you cry or look at this girl who plays the ukulele.

10:25.900 --> 10:29.940
She's so, you know, she's got a story that will break your heart and check out this eight

10:29.940 --> 10:33.500
year old boy that's singing a song about his mom who's dying of cancer and like all these

10:33.500 --> 10:36.040
like, like it's emotional porn.

10:36.040 --> 10:38.940
That show is emotional pornography.

10:38.940 --> 10:40.660
It's Facebook.

10:40.660 --> 10:41.660
It's forward.

10:41.660 --> 10:42.660
Garbage.

10:42.660 --> 10:43.660
It is.

10:43.660 --> 10:44.660
It is.

10:44.660 --> 10:48.220
But it's totally like, and I eat it up like, you know, just like, you know, sometimes you

10:48.220 --> 10:54.680
want real pornography for reasons, so I'm going to say sometimes you want emotional

10:54.680 --> 10:58.020
pornography because I just want to cry.

10:58.020 --> 11:03.020
I need, I need to have a good cry, so I'm going to watch some emotional pornography.

11:03.020 --> 11:04.020
What Loki?

11:04.020 --> 11:06.460
You don't, you don't fall down the well of emotional pornography ever.

11:06.460 --> 11:10.580
No, no, it's just, it's dark soccer.

11:10.580 --> 11:13.380
Well of regular pornography.

11:13.380 --> 11:15.380
Where are these wells filled with pornography?

11:15.380 --> 11:19.300
This is, well Facebook has, and then the other one, well of garbage.

11:19.300 --> 11:24.380
That's like, that's like I'm dumping a drip, jumping into the dumpster there.

11:24.380 --> 11:29.220
A porn hub would be the other, I suppose, I guess a dark, dark soccer.

11:29.220 --> 11:32.500
Do you ever, do you ever sit there for hours and hours and watch emotional pornography?

11:32.500 --> 11:33.500
No.

11:33.500 --> 11:34.500
No.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.500
What is it?

11:35.500 --> 11:36.500
Just me.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.500
Chad.

11:37.500 --> 11:38.500
I do.

11:38.500 --> 11:39.500
I do watch animal cops.

11:39.500 --> 11:40.500
Houston.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.500
Okay.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.500
Okay.

11:42.500 --> 11:45.660
So cute cat videos can totally be emotional pornography.

11:45.660 --> 11:49.380
Like if you just want to sit there and watch cute cat videos for an hour, that's totally

11:49.380 --> 11:50.380
emotional porn.

11:50.380 --> 11:52.900
It's just a different, it's just a different type.

11:52.900 --> 11:56.100
Just like real pornography, many different types.

11:56.100 --> 11:57.380
Okay.

11:57.380 --> 12:04.220
So anyway, on my favorite emotional porn show this week, uh, we had a choir that was on

12:04.220 --> 12:05.220
performing.

12:05.220 --> 12:10.140
It was the Angel City Choral, I think is the name of their group and they are from the

12:10.140 --> 12:11.140
Los Angeles area.

12:11.140 --> 12:14.780
And the big thing is that they're a very diverse group of people.

12:14.780 --> 12:19.700
You know, you've got all sorts of diversity when it comes to races, ethnicity, sexuality,

12:19.700 --> 12:23.300
age, like, you know, political leanings and all that stuff.

12:23.300 --> 12:24.300
That's kind of like their big thing.

12:24.300 --> 12:25.740
They all come together to sing.

12:25.740 --> 12:30.880
Well, they already got through on the first, so I guess the way the show works, there's

12:30.880 --> 12:32.600
like the auditions, right?

12:32.600 --> 12:36.780
So they got through on the auditions with their rendition of, I kid you not, Toto's

12:36.780 --> 12:43.060
Africa, which I know that song is all the rage right now, but they legit did that song

12:43.060 --> 12:44.060
and it was really good.

12:44.060 --> 12:47.860
Like I saw that one too on one of my emotional porn binges and they did a really good job

12:47.860 --> 12:48.860
on that.

12:48.860 --> 12:53.420
Well, they were back this week for, I guess the judges cut as they try to narrow it down,

12:53.420 --> 12:55.580
I think to like the top 32 or something.

12:55.580 --> 13:00.940
So during the judges cut, they sang this one, which some of you gamers, especially the one

13:00.940 --> 13:03.860
that listened to this show might recognize.

13:03.860 --> 13:15.980
Do you recognize this at all?

13:15.980 --> 13:20.140
Yeah, I've played it on OLR before.

13:20.140 --> 13:24.860
We actually had the guy who made this song on OLR some time ago.

13:24.860 --> 13:27.060
It's Baba Yetu from Civilization IV.

13:27.060 --> 13:33.060
It's the epic title opening sequence, which went on to be the first gaming song that got

13:33.060 --> 13:34.060
a Grammy.

13:34.060 --> 13:37.860
Well, I didn't realize this, but apparently that song, maybe because of the fact that

13:37.860 --> 13:41.920
it won the Grammy, it's become kind of like one of the standards.

13:41.920 --> 13:47.860
There's many high schools and so forth that do adaptations of this and well deserved on

13:47.860 --> 13:48.860
Christopher Tin.

13:48.860 --> 13:49.860
It's a great song.

13:49.860 --> 13:51.520
I think most people that have heard this love this song.

13:51.520 --> 13:54.980
And I would say, again, if you like this song, you need to go look up the song he did in

13:54.980 --> 13:57.600
Civilization VI, the Dream of Flight.

13:57.600 --> 13:58.800
I can't remember.

13:58.800 --> 14:01.100
It's in Italian, but it translates to Dream of Flight.

14:01.100 --> 14:02.100
That song is amazing too.

14:02.100 --> 14:07.660
But anyway, Baba Yetu, which is Swahili, if I remember right, for the Lord's Prayer.

14:07.660 --> 14:10.460
That's the song that was on America's Got Talent.

14:10.460 --> 14:12.420
This is kind of an interesting twist though.

14:12.420 --> 14:18.200
So the way it works, I guess they do like 12 acts in an episode and there's a guest

14:18.200 --> 14:22.140
judge there every week because there's like the regular judges like Heidi Klum and Scary

14:22.140 --> 14:23.940
Spice, like the regular judges.

14:23.940 --> 14:27.900
But then there's a guest judge every week and the guest judge can press the golden buzzer

14:27.900 --> 14:28.900
for one act.

14:28.900 --> 14:33.080
Well, the golden busser was press on these guys because it was a really good performance

14:33.080 --> 14:35.880
if you haven't watched it already yet.

14:35.880 --> 14:39.260
But it was pressed by Olivia Munn, which I thought was kind of interesting.

14:39.260 --> 14:40.620
So that was pretty cool.

14:40.620 --> 14:46.500
I wonder if she recognized the song because she's a bit of a gamer, right?

14:46.500 --> 14:47.500
Probably.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.500
Yeah.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.500
So wasn't she on Attack of the Show for a short while?

14:49.500 --> 14:50.500
If I remember right.

14:50.500 --> 14:51.500
Yeah.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.500
So kind of interesting.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.460
Anyhow, so they moved on with that.

14:56.460 --> 14:59.740
Sadly, I don't think I saw the name of the song get checked.

14:59.740 --> 15:03.340
I don't think I heard Christopher Tin get name checked or anything like that, but it

15:03.340 --> 15:08.460
was still one of those moments of, wait a minute, I know this because of a video game.

15:08.460 --> 15:12.340
So it's kind of curious, like if you guys have had any moments, I'll open this up to

15:12.340 --> 15:13.340
chat as well.

15:13.340 --> 15:14.340
I don't know.

15:14.340 --> 15:16.580
And I know I'm springing this on you guys in studio, but maybe you have something that

15:16.580 --> 15:17.980
jumps off top of your head.

15:17.980 --> 15:23.260
Do you have any moments where you've seen like video gaming get represented in a mainstream

15:23.260 --> 15:27.900
culture and you're like, oh, I know that because I'm a gamer.

15:27.900 --> 15:29.780
Have you ever kind of like had that?

15:29.780 --> 15:35.180
I mean, Loki, I imagine like the movie Ready Player One was nothing but that.

15:35.180 --> 15:40.300
So I'm not sure that's the best place to start, but I guess it was a Spielberg movies.

15:40.300 --> 15:46.100
I love calling out what games people are playing on TV dramas.

15:46.100 --> 15:49.660
Like what they're playing on, like, you know, older systems and stuff like that, for example,

15:49.660 --> 15:52.380
house to my wife's displeased.

15:52.380 --> 15:55.780
She's very displeased when I do that, when they think, oh, that's GTA.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.180
Oh, hey, that's Spider-Man.

15:57.180 --> 15:58.620
Oh, hey, that's this.

15:58.620 --> 16:01.300
When they're playing Call of Duty, but it has Atari 2600 noises.

16:01.300 --> 16:02.300
That's right.

16:02.300 --> 16:07.940
He had like a PSP that he got in in one of them, because, you know, Sony tie in probably.

16:07.940 --> 16:09.300
So like I kept calling it.

16:09.300 --> 16:10.300
I'm like, yeah, it's a PSP.

16:10.300 --> 16:12.300
She's like, just stop.

16:12.300 --> 16:13.300
Don't do that.

16:13.300 --> 16:15.500
Jamie, anything that jumps in your mind?

16:15.500 --> 16:19.180
Like I know you don't watch a ton of television, but Ralph, what's OK.

16:19.180 --> 16:20.180
OK.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.180
I like that.

16:21.180 --> 16:22.500
Disney hopping on it.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.500
Yeah.

16:23.500 --> 16:24.500
Disney embracing the gaming culture.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.580
That's a good answer, too.

16:25.580 --> 16:29.220
And I think that's something where gaming culture has kind of embraced it back.

16:29.220 --> 16:31.420
And you know, we're getting a Wreck-It Ralph, too.

16:31.420 --> 16:35.220
And yeah, I think a lot of people watch Wreck-It Ralph to try to catch all the little subtle

16:35.220 --> 16:36.220
references.

16:36.220 --> 16:37.220
That shitty Pixels movie.

16:37.220 --> 16:44.940
I mean, that was definitely a mainstream attempt to capture.

16:44.940 --> 16:46.140
Attempt is a good word.

16:46.140 --> 16:48.500
There was an attempt, Jamie.

16:48.500 --> 16:51.540
There was an attempt.

16:51.540 --> 16:55.540
My point is just that even, you know, there's that attempt.

16:55.540 --> 17:01.820
So yeah, looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Tiger Claw says most would know Olivia Munn

17:01.820 --> 17:05.060
as Psylocke in X-Men Apocalypse.

17:05.060 --> 17:10.300
I believe if I'm not mistaken, she was also the I always get the two Olivia's confused.

17:10.300 --> 17:11.300
She's not.

17:11.300 --> 17:12.580
She's not the one in Tron Legacy.

17:12.580 --> 17:14.180
That's the that's a different Olivia.

17:14.180 --> 17:15.620
Oh, it's the different.

17:15.620 --> 17:16.620
It's the other one.

17:16.620 --> 17:17.620
Olivia Wilde.

17:17.620 --> 17:18.620
Olivia Wilde is.

17:18.620 --> 17:19.620
Yeah.

17:19.620 --> 17:24.100
So no, Olivia Munn was the girlfriend in Magic Mike.

17:24.100 --> 17:28.380
I don't know why my mind goes to Magic Mike, but there you go.

17:28.380 --> 17:31.980
Probably because of that porn well that you're talking about.

17:31.980 --> 17:35.100
Anyway, how dare you?

17:35.100 --> 17:39.900
Bobby Blackwolf points out the MLB All-Star game had a segment about Fortnite and the

17:39.900 --> 17:41.980
players favorite dances.

17:41.980 --> 17:42.980
Dang.

17:42.980 --> 17:45.300
Fortnite is like that game that everybody is freaking.

17:45.300 --> 17:49.140
It's like the Minecraft, I guess, of of 2018.

17:49.140 --> 17:54.040
Bobby Blackwolf also points out Baba Yetu is now the number three downloaded classical

17:54.040 --> 17:55.540
song on iTunes this week.

17:55.540 --> 17:56.540
So it got around.

17:56.540 --> 17:57.540
You're right.

17:57.540 --> 18:01.500
Probably, you know, it was probably labeled with it as that video was circulating the

18:01.500 --> 18:03.540
emotional porn circuit.

18:03.540 --> 18:07.740
So yeah, I'm sure Baba Yetu got a nice little bounce thanks to that mainstream exposure.

18:07.740 --> 18:11.580
And that's part of why, like, even if you're the type where you're like, who cares about

18:11.580 --> 18:12.580
the mainstream?

18:12.580 --> 18:14.220
I like to go against the mainstream.

18:14.220 --> 18:15.220
That's fine.

18:15.220 --> 18:21.100
But realize that, you know, that that exposure in the mainstream still goes a long way for

18:21.100 --> 18:25.060
getting coined for these people like Christopher Ten that, you know, created these songs and

18:25.060 --> 18:26.060
so forth.

18:26.060 --> 18:28.100
So let's see other stuff.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.660
Oh, yeah.

18:29.660 --> 18:33.940
Kaijuto says I saw Mario Brothers represented on Dancing with the Stars.

18:33.940 --> 18:34.940
I remember that was recently.

18:34.940 --> 18:37.220
That was a couple of years like in the past year or two.

18:37.220 --> 18:38.220
I remember seeing that, too.

18:38.220 --> 18:39.220
That's pretty funny.

18:39.220 --> 18:43.020
Yeah, but I don't like to include where it's represented in that cringe.

18:43.020 --> 18:44.620
That's true.

18:44.620 --> 18:46.300
Let's see.

18:46.300 --> 18:50.020
Bobby Blocko says seeing Will Wright interviewed on Colbert Report.

18:50.020 --> 18:51.020
Yeah.

18:51.020 --> 18:53.780
Speaking of late night TV, late night TV has been embraced that more and more.

18:53.780 --> 18:57.380
I know Jimmy Fallon because there's Jimmy Fallon likes games anyway.

18:57.380 --> 18:58.380
Yeah.

18:58.380 --> 18:59.380
There's two Olivia's and there's two Jimmy's.

18:59.380 --> 19:00.780
Also Jimmy Kimmel.

19:00.780 --> 19:02.980
Jimmy Fallon had Reggie on.

19:02.980 --> 19:06.200
Remember when the switch was coming out and there was that infamous thing with Miyamoto

19:06.200 --> 19:09.540
in the audience with like the thumbs down and turning to the thumbs up.

19:09.540 --> 19:12.180
That was from Jimmy Kimmel or Jimmy.

19:12.180 --> 19:13.180
God damn it.

19:13.180 --> 19:14.180
Jimmy Fallon.

19:14.180 --> 19:16.820
Remember, Fallon's the one that lasted himself.

19:16.820 --> 19:17.820
All right.

19:17.820 --> 19:18.820
Just like me.

19:18.820 --> 19:19.820
No, it's all right.

19:19.820 --> 19:20.820
It's funny.

19:20.820 --> 19:26.380
I couldn't stand Fallon in SNL, but when he hit late night, it was actually much better.

19:26.380 --> 19:31.820
Act Deft says not sure if related, but there was a national TV channel in Mexico that used

19:31.820 --> 19:35.980
don't know if they still do music from many video games in their news segments.

19:35.980 --> 19:40.860
There would be stuff from Silent Hill even in some of those.

19:40.860 --> 19:43.500
Why do you have Silent Hill music on the news?

19:43.500 --> 19:50.420
Like that's kind of today we opened up a new, that's what I feel about American news.

19:50.420 --> 19:51.420
I hate that.

19:51.420 --> 19:52.420
I'm laughing at that, but it's true.

19:52.420 --> 20:00.940
We've opened up a new mall, Silent Hill music, free puppies, you know, uh, guys, you know,

20:00.940 --> 20:05.100
pointing out rocket league was on blackish, uh, that I've heard a lot of good things about

20:05.100 --> 20:06.100
that show.

20:06.100 --> 20:08.940
I haven't seen it myself yet, but I know that's on ABC and does very well.

20:08.940 --> 20:13.340
Uh, Bob Coffey kind of piggybacking on the Mexico thing saying Japan does that with news

20:13.340 --> 20:18.780
sometimes and probably because, um, you know, video gaming probably got embedded in mainstream

20:18.780 --> 20:22.500
Japanese culture before it really got embedded in ours.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.180
Anyway, those are some good answers.

20:24.180 --> 20:25.180
You guys.

20:25.180 --> 20:26.180
Thank you.

20:26.180 --> 20:30.380
I like, you know, I like seeing these games like, Oh, you know, it shows up somewhere.

20:30.380 --> 20:31.380
It's pretty cool.

20:31.380 --> 20:35.860
Anyway, let's talk a little bit about some games that we saw this week and talk a little

20:35.860 --> 20:37.500
bit about our gaming weeks.

20:37.540 --> 20:41.260
So dark soccer, I know, I'm sure you got tons of classic games to talk about.

20:41.260 --> 20:42.260
Yeah.

20:42.260 --> 20:43.260
I have to pull out the list.

20:43.260 --> 20:44.260
All right.

20:44.260 --> 20:45.260
It's a three hour show.

20:45.260 --> 20:46.260
Jamie.

20:46.260 --> 20:49.060
Well, I, I, I was lately, it's only been two.

20:49.060 --> 20:52.580
I was pretty, um, particular about what I played.

20:52.580 --> 20:58.580
So in, um, so played Beatmania three, the final, which of course, but then I got mad

20:58.580 --> 21:02.880
at Dan cause he, he tried to join in with me, which of course put it in co-op mode,

21:02.880 --> 21:04.820
which I hate about five key.

21:04.820 --> 21:05.820
Yeah.

21:05.940 --> 21:08.380
And then doesn't like, you only play like alternating notes or something.

21:08.380 --> 21:09.380
Yeah.

21:09.380 --> 21:10.900
So, or parts of different parts of the song.

21:10.900 --> 21:15.180
So I just waited for it to fail us so I could play by myself again.

21:15.180 --> 21:20.140
And then, uh, Ray crisis, they had a bunch of candy cabs, you know, the Japanese cabinets.

21:20.140 --> 21:22.980
So it played, um, Ray crisis, which was a lot of fun.

21:22.980 --> 21:28.700
Um, then we went upstairs to the console room and played streets of rage to win a Sega Genesis,

21:28.700 --> 21:34.300
which was pretty fun to, um, pop and stage, which I did have to give it a try and decided

21:34.300 --> 21:35.300
it's not for me.

21:35.300 --> 21:38.220
It just is not intuitive to play.

21:38.220 --> 21:41.940
And then it played theaters, um, uh, final fantasy all star carnival, which was super

21:41.940 --> 21:42.940
fun.

21:42.940 --> 21:48.260
I love theater them in the arcade, then, uh, riding DX, which is one of my favorite shooters

21:48.260 --> 21:55.740
like ever because of the purple Rappy laser, um, played donkey Kong on a, uh, uh, sit down

21:55.740 --> 22:02.620
table and I hate the controller on it because it's, um, it's coming out horizontally instead

22:02.620 --> 22:04.260
of on a little shelf vertically.

22:04.260 --> 22:06.140
So I really don't like it.

22:06.140 --> 22:13.100
Um, I played another game called Mamoru Koon curse, which is like a running shooter and

22:13.100 --> 22:16.300
slightly bullet hellish, but it was really a fun game.

22:16.300 --> 22:23.140
Um, I played another real bullet hell game that I completely bombed at called AKA V blue.

22:23.140 --> 22:26.540
Um, it was, it was pretty fun.

22:26.540 --> 22:27.540
Very pretty.

22:27.540 --> 22:29.220
I like the shell, the cell shaded style of it.

22:29.220 --> 22:30.220
Oh yeah.

22:30.220 --> 22:31.220
I love that game.

22:31.220 --> 22:32.220
Yeah.

22:32.820 --> 22:36.260
It was, uh, it was on the, um, the dreamcast hardware.

22:36.260 --> 22:38.780
I forget the Naomi hardware, I think.

22:38.780 --> 22:40.340
I think it's newer than that.

22:40.340 --> 22:41.340
No, you're right.

22:41.340 --> 22:44.380
It's, uh, it's much newer than that.

22:44.380 --> 22:45.380
I can't remember.

22:45.380 --> 22:51.260
Was it, is it dolphin blue is what that was or cause I think that's what it is in English.

22:51.260 --> 22:54.220
No, it's basically red versus blue.

22:54.220 --> 22:55.220
AKA is red.

22:55.220 --> 22:56.220
Hmm.

22:56.220 --> 23:00.420
Maybe I think I'll send you a picture of, of what it looked like, but it was, it was

23:00.620 --> 23:01.620
pretty good.

23:01.620 --> 23:02.620
Pretty good shooter.

23:02.620 --> 23:04.460
Um, it was just really tough.

23:04.460 --> 23:10.460
Um, I played, um, they had a dragon ball fighter Z, um, arcade set up, although it was the

23:10.460 --> 23:13.060
console version with arcade cabinet stuff.

23:13.060 --> 23:15.540
So it was fun.

23:15.540 --> 23:18.800
These two guys were just like continuing over and over and over.

23:18.800 --> 23:24.760
So I made a very salty, gee, it would be nice if other people get to play and they both

23:24.760 --> 23:28.300
looked chagrined and you know, eventually got up.

23:28.300 --> 23:30.500
Um, I played another game.

23:30.500 --> 23:35.460
Well, before that I played dual Donpach, which of course, you know, fun game.

23:35.460 --> 23:39.020
It's on, it's got an iOS release too, although it's still expensive.

23:39.020 --> 23:40.020
Really?

23:40.020 --> 23:41.020
Hmm.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.020
That's a fun thing.

23:42.020 --> 23:43.020
Donpach like the thing.

23:43.020 --> 23:45.400
Um, I played music gun gun.

23:45.400 --> 23:46.500
Have you seen that one?

23:46.500 --> 23:49.540
Uh, is that the one that's like gigantic?

23:49.540 --> 23:50.540
It's like a gigantic machine.

23:50.540 --> 23:53.700
I think I've seen it around one where you have like the gun, you shoot in the rhythm.

23:53.700 --> 23:54.700
Yeah.

23:54.700 --> 23:55.700
That game is interesting.

23:55.700 --> 23:56.700
That game was pretty fun.

23:57.100 --> 23:58.980
Um, I played the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

23:58.980 --> 23:59.980
It's no point blank.

23:59.980 --> 24:00.980
No, but it's really fun.

24:00.980 --> 24:01.980
Okay.

24:01.980 --> 24:04.980
But I played the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the one based off of the CG.

24:04.980 --> 24:05.980
Wake up, Tigerclaw.

24:05.980 --> 24:06.980
Wake up.

24:06.980 --> 24:11.260
The one based off the CG, you know, kids show version.

24:11.260 --> 24:16.780
Melody and I took turns on that one because, um, they were on the final boss rush.

24:16.780 --> 24:17.780
Oh.

24:17.780 --> 24:20.380
And I got a little bit tired, so she took over playing Raphael.

24:20.380 --> 24:21.380
It was pretty fun.

24:21.380 --> 24:22.380
That's cool.

24:22.380 --> 24:23.380
Yeah.

24:23.380 --> 24:24.380
It's a neat game.

24:24.380 --> 24:25.500
Did it kind of remind you of the old one?

24:25.500 --> 24:26.500
Yeah.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.300
But, man, Raphael has no freaking range.

24:29.300 --> 24:32.900
Um, but he did still have like the slam back and forth move.

24:32.900 --> 24:33.900
That one was pretty fun.

24:33.900 --> 24:38.500
Um, then I played, uh, God Plus, which I'm probably going to do that as a classic game

24:38.500 --> 24:39.500
at some point.

24:39.500 --> 24:43.700
God Plus, for those who don't know, is, um, Galaga 3.

24:43.700 --> 24:48.060
It was renamed as Galaga 3 because people didn't realize that God Plus was the same

24:48.060 --> 24:51.700
one, which the funny thing about it is you can get this little weapon if you shoot a

24:51.700 --> 24:57.580
particular enemy that gives you like a vacuum funnel and you can absorb some of the enemies

24:57.580 --> 25:02.020
and then they become shooter options until they get hit.

25:02.020 --> 25:03.020
It's pretty neat.

25:03.020 --> 25:09.020
Um, then I played Rhythm Tengoku, um, which was, you know, Rhythm Heaven, for those who

25:09.020 --> 25:11.420
don't know what Tengoku means by this point.

25:11.420 --> 25:15.420
Um, Steel Chronicle Vic Troopers, that was another neat game.

25:15.460 --> 25:22.660
Um, basically, it's, uh, behind the, uh, the mech that you're playing, but you have, um,

25:22.660 --> 25:23.660
different controls.

25:23.660 --> 25:26.660
Like, you have one that controls, like, camera angle and the other one that controls your

25:26.660 --> 25:30.140
movement with different, uh, guns and bombs and things.

25:30.140 --> 25:32.660
It was a pretty neat, neat little battle game.

25:32.660 --> 25:37.500
Um, I played, the only pinball I played was Hyper Ball, which doesn't really pinball,

25:37.500 --> 25:38.880
to be honest.

25:38.880 --> 25:39.880
And then I played...

25:39.880 --> 25:43.300
I was about to ask why you didn't play more pinball, but then I'm like, oh yeah, she can

25:43.300 --> 25:45.940
kind of play, like, a lot of pinball at home whenever she wants.

25:45.940 --> 25:48.140
Yeah, that's really the truth.

25:48.140 --> 25:52.660
Um, then I played Mushihime Tama, which isn't Mushihime Sama, it's Mushihime Tama, where

25:52.660 --> 25:57.500
you play the character from Mushihime Sama on a little, like, bubble game.

25:57.500 --> 26:05.260
Kind of a little bit of Puyo Puyo meets, um, I don't know, it's just like you have to drop

26:05.260 --> 26:09.980
these blobs on the same color and you have, like, an arc, so you either have to do up

26:09.980 --> 26:15.780
left or down right to control how your bubbles are going to throw.

26:15.780 --> 26:24.340
You control the arc of it, so maybe a little bit of Angry Birds meets Puyo Puyo and how

26:24.340 --> 26:25.340
you have to control it.

26:25.340 --> 26:30.820
It was a neat little game, I got decently through it, and that was all I played.

26:30.820 --> 26:32.820
Alright!

26:32.820 --> 26:34.420
Sounds like you still had a very busy day.

26:34.420 --> 26:37.340
I had a very busy day, and I bought games.

26:37.340 --> 26:38.340
Oh, did you?

26:38.340 --> 26:39.540
Dan and I bought some stuff.

26:39.540 --> 26:41.540
Yeah, anything a note, real quick?

26:41.540 --> 26:42.540
Um, yes.

26:42.540 --> 26:43.540
Like, all of it?

26:43.540 --> 26:46.780
I bought myself a copy of Dance Summit, because I'm going to give Shane back his as soon as

26:46.780 --> 26:47.780
I find it.

26:47.780 --> 26:48.780
Oh, cool!

26:48.780 --> 26:50.780
Um, 20 bucks, but not bad.

26:50.780 --> 26:52.780
That's not bad, no, for that?

26:52.780 --> 26:57.300
No, um, I like to buy from Tiny Potato when I'm there.

26:57.300 --> 27:04.500
Their prices are, I'm not going to, they're fair for what they're selling, but they do

27:04.500 --> 27:06.500
know the value of their stuff.

27:06.500 --> 27:07.500
Sure.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.500
And they're great guys.

27:08.500 --> 27:12.060
For those that don't know, Dance Summit is bust a move slash groove three.

27:12.060 --> 27:13.060
Yeah, essentially.

27:13.060 --> 27:14.060
Basically, yeah.

27:14.060 --> 27:16.780
It's like the multi-player team dance.

27:16.780 --> 27:17.780
Yep.

27:17.780 --> 27:24.460
Um, and then, um, Dan bought Shantae for, um, uh, Wii U.

27:24.460 --> 27:25.460
Oh, random!

27:25.460 --> 27:32.780
And, well, Wii One, I already had it on Switch, not on Switch, but on, um, Steam.

27:32.780 --> 27:35.820
And then, um, he bought Bayonetta 2 for Wii U.

27:35.820 --> 27:36.820
Nice.

27:36.820 --> 27:37.820
Which comes with Bayonetta 1.

27:38.140 --> 27:39.140
And I was like, you know, that's on Switch, right?

27:39.140 --> 27:40.140
He's like, it is?

27:40.140 --> 27:41.140
Yeah.

27:41.140 --> 27:45.940
He's like, I was like, yeah, but we now have it for Wii U, so whatevs.

27:45.940 --> 27:50.660
Well, yeah, and now that the Wii U is kind of like, I wouldn't say it's completely sunsetted

27:50.660 --> 27:55.220
yet, but like, we're like two minutes to midnight on the Wii U here, like it's, it's pretty

27:55.220 --> 27:56.220
much done.

27:56.220 --> 27:59.260
And, uh, you know, that, I think it's going to be the value of things like that kind of

27:59.260 --> 28:00.260
go up.

28:00.260 --> 28:01.260
You know what I mean?

28:01.260 --> 28:02.260
It's collector's items.

28:02.260 --> 28:05.660
Well, and then I bought him something that he told me not to buy him, but I know he wanted

28:05.660 --> 28:09.280
it and he doesn't know I bought it for him, so he's, I left it on the bottom of the stack

28:09.280 --> 28:10.280
of games on the table.

28:10.280 --> 28:11.280
Oh.

28:11.280 --> 28:17.580
I bought him the Sega Aegis, uh, 2500, um, Gunstar Heroes collection that also comes

28:17.580 --> 28:22.380
with Dynamite Headdy and, um, some other treasure game.

28:22.380 --> 28:28.020
It's the treasure box, but I wanted to get him that so he could, and I'm trying to convince

28:28.020 --> 28:29.020
him first.

28:29.020 --> 28:34.900
I'm going to try to convince him first to stream Gunstar Heroes through the PS2, um,

28:34.900 --> 28:42.020
but I'm also deciding if I think I am going to do the Halo thing, if I can get my mom's

28:42.020 --> 28:43.900
rent paid for next month.

28:43.900 --> 28:49.140
So, and I would have to do it from a place that's already set up to stream off Xbox.

28:49.140 --> 28:52.840
Actually, I'm not set up for Xbox.

28:52.840 --> 28:57.060
I don't know if there's any Halos on PC that I have, but I can check that out.

28:57.060 --> 29:01.460
Um, but I don't actually usually, I mean, it's not hard to do the Xbox.

29:01.460 --> 29:08.500
I'm not set up at mine too, but, um, well, if I'll talk to you off air.

29:08.500 --> 29:09.500
You've got the mic stuff set up.

29:09.500 --> 29:10.500
Yeah.

29:10.500 --> 29:13.620
I was gonna say, I'll talk to you off air because there's things and reasons why Twitch

29:13.620 --> 29:15.500
broadcasting may soon be portable.

29:15.500 --> 29:18.820
So all right, anyway, uh, let's see.

29:18.820 --> 29:23.480
Going to chat, uh, at live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf says, Wii U still has virtual

29:23.480 --> 29:24.480
console.

29:24.480 --> 29:25.480
Yes, that's true.

29:25.480 --> 29:26.980
Uh, Wii U does have virtual console.

29:26.980 --> 29:29.000
That's why I didn't say it's dead.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.920
That's why I said it's more like last call.

29:32.920 --> 29:34.160
That's a good way to put it.

29:34.160 --> 29:38.560
As far as we use concern last call, uh, act def says you can probably get master chief

29:38.560 --> 29:39.640
collection for the Xbox one.

29:39.640 --> 29:40.720
I have it.

29:40.720 --> 29:42.840
My Xbox one just isn't set up for streaming.

29:42.840 --> 29:48.000
It's probably not that hard to get it all set up, but at the same time, you know, we

29:48.000 --> 29:50.960
don't have an Xbox one and I'm not going to have one.

29:50.960 --> 29:51.960
I thought you guys did.

29:51.960 --> 29:52.960
No.

29:52.960 --> 29:53.960
Oh shoot.

29:53.960 --> 29:54.960
Okay.

29:54.960 --> 29:55.960
We had zero reason to buy one.

29:55.960 --> 29:56.960
There's nothing really on it.

29:56.960 --> 29:57.960
It's that was worthwhile to us.

29:57.960 --> 29:59.840
Maybe 60 to stream the old halos if nothing else.

29:59.840 --> 30:00.840
Yeah.

30:00.840 --> 30:01.840
Okay.

30:01.840 --> 30:02.840
So we can work something out.

30:02.840 --> 30:03.840
All right.

30:03.840 --> 30:04.840
Cool.

30:04.840 --> 30:05.840
Uh, let's see.

30:05.840 --> 30:06.840
Let's move on with our gaming weeks.

30:06.840 --> 30:07.840
Loki.

30:07.840 --> 30:08.840
I didn't play much this week.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.240
I mainly played Pokemon just to and from work.

30:11.240 --> 30:17.480
Um, I did play a few things today cause we went to fair game, which is a local retro

30:17.480 --> 30:18.800
game store nearby.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.840
So we played some of the arcade games there.

30:20.840 --> 30:26.880
So, um, I played arrow fighters too for briefly cause my youngest son's like, play this game,

30:26.880 --> 30:27.880
play this game.

30:27.880 --> 30:30.280
Like, okay, I'll play this game.

30:30.280 --> 30:35.640
And then my son played on a play choice 10 and he had a, he wanted to play super Mario

30:35.640 --> 30:37.960
brothers two on that.

30:37.960 --> 30:38.960
I'm like, okay, that's weird.

30:38.960 --> 30:41.960
We, I'm like, we have this at home free.

30:41.960 --> 30:43.200
I don't know why I'm gonna play this here.

30:43.200 --> 30:46.360
Um, and they play a little bit of super Mario brothers three as well.

30:46.360 --> 30:49.240
And apparently I'm very rusty when it comes to super Mario brothers three.

30:49.240 --> 30:53.400
I'm like, cause I was like, stand aside, I'll show you how it's done.

30:53.400 --> 30:56.760
And they immediately did not show them how it's done.

30:56.760 --> 31:00.120
I was like, damn, I'm out of practice.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.120
Did dad let them down?

31:01.120 --> 31:03.000
I let myself down.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
I was defeated.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Nice.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
I had anything else?

31:07.000 --> 31:09.240
Uh, that's it.

31:09.240 --> 31:11.280
Just been mainly working in Unreal.

31:11.280 --> 31:12.280
All right.

31:12.280 --> 31:16.920
Uh, my gaming week was also not quite as, uh, fun filled as Jamie's just because, um,

31:16.920 --> 31:19.160
again, I was focusing for a performance yesterday.

31:19.160 --> 31:24.000
Um, but I did get to play a little bit, so, um, I'm still continuing on doing my, uh,

31:24.000 --> 31:26.520
little gold quests every day in heroes of the storm.

31:26.520 --> 31:29.640
So I'm still playing that, but I pretty much only do versus AI.

31:29.640 --> 31:34.440
And I had such a terrible match last night that I, I thought it was going to be like

31:34.440 --> 31:38.440
the first time I ever, well, maybe, I don't think it's the first time, but like the first

31:38.440 --> 31:42.280
time in like a year that I've actually lost the versus AI mode.

31:42.280 --> 31:46.000
Like I would have been so upset, but we pulled it through in the very end, but I was getting

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
worried.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.680
Uh, for those that play heroes of the storm, it was the black hearts bay and somehow the

31:50.680 --> 31:55.840
enemy team actually got like two or three turn ins on the cannons, which, you know,

31:55.840 --> 31:57.720
in versus AI, like never happens.

31:57.720 --> 32:00.840
So anyway, it was very frustrating, but we did it.

32:00.840 --> 32:01.960
Uh, let's see.

32:01.960 --> 32:06.280
I've been playing a lot of Lucio in that game because of, uh, the, just the quests I've

32:06.280 --> 32:07.280
been getting.

32:07.280 --> 32:11.840
I got like, when as a support hero, when as an overwatch hero, then again, when as a support

32:11.840 --> 32:12.840
hero.

32:12.840 --> 32:16.840
So I've just been playing quite a bit of a Lucio with that, um, who makes a fun character

32:16.840 --> 32:17.840
in heroes of the storm.

32:17.840 --> 32:20.040
I like, I like some of the overwatch crossover stuff.

32:20.080 --> 32:24.240
I wonder if wrecking balls show up in a heroes of the storm, which means I did play a little

32:24.240 --> 32:25.240
bit of overwatch.

32:25.240 --> 32:31.080
Uh, I've been doing some random heroes have not gotten wrecking ball in random heroes.

32:31.080 --> 32:35.480
I know he's in there cause I see him show up on the other teams, but um, I, one match

32:35.480 --> 32:38.720
I was doing, I kept getting mercy over and over and over again, which is fine cause you

32:38.720 --> 32:42.800
know, I can actually play mercy, but it's when I get the, it's when I get like reaper

32:42.800 --> 32:49.160
like the two characters I just, I can't play for crap are reaper and especially tracer.

32:49.160 --> 32:52.720
I just don't understand how to play tracer.

32:52.720 --> 32:57.640
Like I'm trying, like I'm trying, I'm learning more about how like you kind of dart in to

32:57.640 --> 33:01.200
hit somebody in the back line and then pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, and then rewind to get

33:01.200 --> 33:02.200
back to where you were.

33:02.200 --> 33:07.240
But it's, it's, I, I, I'm better at it with Sombra and I, I really liked the changes they

33:07.240 --> 33:13.580
made with Sombra because now the little invisibility and the teleportation mechanism are infinite

33:13.580 --> 33:17.280
amount of time except the teleportation mechanism can be destroyed, but if you hide it well

33:17.280 --> 33:18.840
enough, that won't be a problem.

33:18.840 --> 33:23.380
So that's what I like to do with Sombra is run in there invisible, then make myself visible

33:23.380 --> 33:26.080
to try to get the healer in the back line or at least hack them.

33:26.080 --> 33:27.600
So mercy can't rez or something.

33:27.600 --> 33:30.240
And then the minute they see me, poof, teleport out of there.

33:30.240 --> 33:31.920
So it's, it's kind of like a similar strategy.

33:31.920 --> 33:34.840
I think I'm just better at it with Sombra than I am with tracer.

33:34.840 --> 33:40.760
So let's see, we can hit chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

33:40.760 --> 33:41.760
Let's see.

33:41.760 --> 33:46.480
Bonds 006 says, no, Rob, I don't want any Overwatch in my heroes of the storm.

33:46.480 --> 33:47.480
Too late.

33:47.520 --> 33:54.200
Like six characters from Overwatch in heroes of the storm, like Ana, Lucio, Zarya, Junkrat,

33:54.200 --> 34:00.520
Hanzo, like, and I really enjoy playing Hanzo in heroes of the storm, but I would say he's,

34:00.520 --> 34:04.440
he's probably the third character I get pissed off when I get in random heroes in Overwatch.

34:04.440 --> 34:07.920
Cause I don't like playing with him either.

34:07.920 --> 34:08.920
But oddly I can do Widowmaker.

34:08.920 --> 34:10.200
I just can't do Hanzo.

34:10.200 --> 34:11.200
It's weird.

34:11.200 --> 34:12.920
Uh, let's see.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.480
And then sj100matt says, I can't play tracer either.

34:15.480 --> 34:16.480
Okay, good.

34:17.480 --> 34:21.040
And bonds 006 says, I target all D.Va players.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.040
She is annoying.

34:22.040 --> 34:29.000
Uh, D.Va, yeah, D.Va's one of the few tanks that I feel like I can actually sort of play.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.960
I feel like my best tank is Orisa.

34:30.960 --> 34:36.980
I have yet to be able to play any tank as good as I can Orisa, but, um, yeah, I, I do

34:36.980 --> 34:37.980
like D.Va.

34:37.980 --> 34:39.440
D.Va's probably my second or third.

34:39.440 --> 34:43.840
Um, oh, in heroes of the storm though, I don't like D.Va in heroes of the storm.

34:43.920 --> 34:47.320
I don't think, she, she doesn't really work the same way in heroes of the storm.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.080
I don't like her in that game.

34:49.080 --> 34:54.560
Um, it's just not the same, so, um, but I've seen other people use her well, I'm just not

34:54.560 --> 34:55.560
good with her.

34:55.560 --> 34:59.320
Anyway, other stuff I played this week, uh, Pokemon Go as well, of course, I'm always

34:59.320 --> 35:00.320
playing that.

35:00.320 --> 35:03.480
Uh, and I think I mentioned the level 16 in Ingress, I mentioned that last show, right?

35:03.480 --> 35:04.480
Cause I think it was last Friday.

35:04.480 --> 35:05.480
Okay.

35:05.480 --> 35:06.600
Uh, but I'm still playing it.

35:06.600 --> 35:07.600
I didn't stop.

35:07.600 --> 35:11.960
Uh, and I know they had a big, big Ingress thing, like all the, uh, people that you heard

35:11.960 --> 35:13.200
on the show back in January.

35:13.200 --> 35:16.480
They were all in San Diego cause they had the big live event in San Diego this weekend.

35:16.480 --> 35:18.840
Oh, I got a little pop up when I opened Ingress today.

35:18.840 --> 35:23.000
Yeah, and I, I couldn't, because of Clue again, I couldn't do anything.

35:23.000 --> 35:28.560
You know, sometimes I do behind the scenes support, but I couldn't do it even for this.

35:28.560 --> 35:32.840
So uh, but I'm glad to hear they did, my team did really well, so it was very happy to hear

35:32.840 --> 35:33.840
it.

35:33.840 --> 35:38.180
Um, anyway, um, other stuff that I did play, No Man's Sky next.

35:38.180 --> 35:41.280
So I went back to No Man's Sky this week as I imagine a lot of you did.

35:41.280 --> 35:44.760
Uh, and if you own the game and you haven't gone back, you really should.

35:44.760 --> 35:46.400
I mean, because it's not going to cost you anything.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.080
This is not pay content.

35:48.080 --> 35:53.240
This is them trying to Diablo 3 or Final Fantasy 14 their game.

35:53.240 --> 35:57.240
They're trying to bring it back from a game that was very broken and well, I don't know.

35:57.240 --> 35:58.900
I said, let me dial it back.

35:58.900 --> 36:03.500
I don't think No Man's Sky was ever like super broken, but clearly it was not the fully realized

36:03.500 --> 36:07.240
game that they were hyping up or that they really wanted it to be.

36:07.240 --> 36:11.180
So they were doing these patches for a little while and then they've kind of been silent

36:11.180 --> 36:14.640
for about nine months while they've been working on this big patch.

36:14.640 --> 36:20.140
So they put out this big patch and now you can do a multiplayer, uh, Dark Soccer.

36:20.140 --> 36:21.140
You might be interested in this.

36:21.140 --> 36:23.500
The default view now is third person.

36:23.500 --> 36:26.180
So No Man's Sky is no longer exclusively a first person thing.

36:26.180 --> 36:29.380
You can play in third person because I know you've talked about on the show before your

36:29.380 --> 36:33.500
motion sickness where you way prefer a third person view because you can do that better.

36:33.500 --> 36:36.620
If I didn't have so many things on my list, I would go for it.

36:36.620 --> 36:37.620
Yeah.

36:37.620 --> 36:39.260
I think, I think you would get a kick out of No Man's Sky actually.

36:39.260 --> 36:40.260
I don't know.

36:40.260 --> 36:41.260
I don't know.

36:41.260 --> 36:42.260
It's hard to say.

36:42.260 --> 36:43.820
Sometimes I, I have a hard time judging your tastes.

36:43.820 --> 36:48.940
I would have never guessed that you would have become as obsessed with like Dragon Age

36:48.940 --> 36:50.540
and Mass Effect as you did.

36:50.540 --> 36:51.540
You know what I mean?

36:51.540 --> 36:52.540
They're fine.

36:52.540 --> 36:56.020
Yeah, no, I, I, I, but it's mostly because of good character development.

36:56.020 --> 36:57.620
Yeah, no, they do have a great story.

36:57.620 --> 36:58.620
They really do.

36:58.620 --> 37:03.220
Um, so anyway, um, but unfortunately No Man's Sky doesn't really have story.

37:03.220 --> 37:05.540
Um, it's more of like a sandbox type of thing.

37:05.540 --> 37:10.980
I mean, there is a story, but you know, technically there's a story in Minecraft too.

37:10.980 --> 37:11.980
You know what I mean?

37:11.980 --> 37:12.980
So anyway.

37:12.980 --> 37:14.940
Um, but I, I, yeah, I'm enjoying the updates.

37:14.940 --> 37:19.180
I was doing some live streams, uh, over on my Twitch channel, Rob Roberts on Twitch.

37:19.180 --> 37:24.380
And uh, I was doing some streams and, uh, when I was playing one of them, Bobby Blackwolf,

37:24.380 --> 37:27.940
uh, from also from VOG ended up joining my game.

37:27.940 --> 37:30.160
And so he was able to come to my planet.

37:30.160 --> 37:33.980
So in my solar system, I started on a really crappy planet and I think that's what this

37:33.980 --> 37:34.980
game is doing now.

37:34.980 --> 37:38.820
I think it starts you on a crappy planet on purpose so that you have to learn real quick

37:38.820 --> 37:40.860
about the basic techniques for survival.

37:40.860 --> 37:44.020
But the good news is they put in like these quick access menu that make it really easy

37:44.020 --> 37:48.660
to like feed yourself the oxygen and the, um, sodium and the stuff that you need to

37:48.660 --> 37:50.540
kind of like for basic life support.

37:50.540 --> 37:53.740
You can feed that really easy as opposed to like having to like open up the menu going

37:53.740 --> 37:54.740
to this.

37:54.740 --> 37:55.740
It was really cumbersome before.

37:55.740 --> 37:57.180
Um, so they made that really easy.

37:57.180 --> 38:01.140
So you learn how to survive really quick, which I actually, even though it was kind

38:01.140 --> 38:05.300
of scary and annoying, I think it taught me the game better by doing that.

38:05.300 --> 38:07.300
So anyway, I went to another planet.

38:07.300 --> 38:08.300
It was also very toxic.

38:08.300 --> 38:12.980
But the third planet I went to, I touched down and the little planet scan shows up and

38:12.980 --> 38:20.100
it's like sentinels, not very aggressive, um, animal life, peaceful, uh, weather blissful.

38:20.100 --> 38:24.700
And everything was like, it was like, this planet is like a casuals dream, right?

38:24.700 --> 38:28.020
There's like nothing going on in this planet and it's a beautiful planet.

38:28.020 --> 38:31.300
So I named it because I remember blissful was the term that stuck out of my mind.

38:31.300 --> 38:33.380
I named the planet Blissey.

38:33.380 --> 38:38.020
So there's this planet called Blissey in a universe that Bobby ended up naming Voglandia.

38:38.020 --> 38:39.900
So there's the planet Blissey.

38:39.900 --> 38:43.340
And so Bobby kind of like moved in on that planet.

38:43.340 --> 38:47.460
So I created a base and apparently since I stopped, I have not logged in since I made

38:47.460 --> 38:48.460
that base.

38:48.460 --> 38:51.180
Apparently he made a base across the lake as well.

38:51.180 --> 38:54.220
So he's kind of moved in on that planet and I know Dungeon Buster showed up.

38:54.220 --> 38:55.220
My friend Neil showed up.

38:55.220 --> 38:58.620
I don't know if they made bases too, but I know like people have been converging on planet

38:58.620 --> 39:03.200
Blissey as kind of like, and that's kind of cool because we were able to do multiplayer.

39:03.200 --> 39:07.620
And so I was running around with Bobby and we were trying to find the only downside to

39:07.620 --> 39:09.720
Blissey that we kind of have learned.

39:09.720 --> 39:11.320
There's like no caves.

39:11.320 --> 39:12.860
There is no natural cave system.

39:12.860 --> 39:16.100
And even if you try to make your own caves, like we're not finding anything like the planet

39:16.100 --> 39:17.660
is very flat.

39:17.660 --> 39:21.520
So we're not finding the resources we need that are usually underground.

39:21.520 --> 39:25.100
So but we were trying to run around looking for him and I would keep getting distracted

39:25.100 --> 39:28.580
and be like, Bobby, look at this tower over here and we'd be on our jet packs like flying

39:28.580 --> 39:29.580
over there.

39:29.580 --> 39:30.580
And that was kind of cool.

39:30.580 --> 39:32.120
Like that we could go like explore that together.

39:32.120 --> 39:37.260
And I didn't realize I think how cool of a feature that was and maybe why people wanted

39:37.260 --> 39:41.740
that so bad in the beginning until I kind of experienced that and then experience that

39:41.740 --> 39:45.460
we would get to the tower and then Bobby would take the item in the tower before I could

39:45.460 --> 39:46.460
get to it.

39:46.460 --> 39:51.580
So that was a whole experience that I didn't get in the original No Man's Sky, but it was

39:51.580 --> 39:52.580
fun.

39:52.580 --> 39:53.580
It was good.

39:53.580 --> 39:55.940
It's like it's 25 bucks for PS4.

39:55.940 --> 39:56.940
Yeah.

39:56.940 --> 40:01.540
Um, I think it's been having like a half off sales since I didn't already, you know, spend

40:01.540 --> 40:03.180
a hundred bucks on video games this weekend.

40:03.180 --> 40:04.180
I know.

40:04.180 --> 40:05.180
I hear you.

40:05.180 --> 40:08.780
I feel the fine cheap use too because I'm sure a lot of people just said, ah, fuck this.

40:08.780 --> 40:10.060
And yeah, it might still be out there.

40:10.060 --> 40:11.060
Use it.

40:11.060 --> 40:12.060
Might be harder to find now.

40:12.060 --> 40:13.060
So that people are scooping it up because of the update.

40:13.060 --> 40:14.840
I'm for 25 bucks for the prime.

40:14.840 --> 40:18.940
I should say though, yeah, Bobby and I are on the PS4 version of the game just because

40:18.940 --> 40:20.580
that's, I thought I doubled it.

40:20.580 --> 40:22.660
I thought I did get it on PC at one point.

40:22.660 --> 40:26.300
I swear I double dipped and got it on PC, but I don't have it on my computer.

40:26.300 --> 40:27.300
I searched everything.

40:27.300 --> 40:30.100
It's not my steam library and I don't think I would have bought it on GOG.

40:30.100 --> 40:31.340
In fact, I looked on GOG.

40:31.340 --> 40:33.140
It wasn't there and I don't think I bought it anywhere else.

40:33.140 --> 40:34.540
GOG's not getting the update until later.

40:34.540 --> 40:36.100
Yeah, I heard about the GOG stuff.

40:36.100 --> 40:40.260
So, but did you hear that GOG was willing to like refund anybody on that game?

40:40.260 --> 40:41.260
Oh yeah.

40:41.260 --> 40:44.640
GOG came out and was like, if you're unhappy about this, we tried to work with the developer.

40:44.640 --> 40:45.960
You can refund the game basically.

40:45.960 --> 40:47.980
So I thought that was, you know, good man GOG.

40:47.980 --> 40:48.980
Woo.

40:48.980 --> 40:49.980
Yeah.

40:49.980 --> 40:50.980
Okay.

40:50.980 --> 40:52.980
Um, I thought I had it on PC, but I don't.

40:52.980 --> 40:54.300
Alan has it on PC.

40:54.300 --> 40:58.540
So I think what happened is that when our steam libraries would still talk to each other,

40:58.540 --> 41:02.060
because that stopped working a long time ago, I think I might've used his copy of No Man's

41:02.060 --> 41:03.060
Sky at one point.

41:03.060 --> 41:05.700
And I think that's why I remember playing it on PC.

41:05.700 --> 41:10.500
But anyway, Dungeon Buster says I found a cave on my second visit.

41:10.500 --> 41:11.500
Oh my gosh.

41:11.500 --> 41:12.500
I didn't know that.

41:12.500 --> 41:13.500
Planet Blissey has caves that are just really far apart.

41:13.500 --> 41:14.620
Oh, that's good to know.

41:14.620 --> 41:17.860
You have to mark that somehow so we can find it, Dungeon Buster.

41:17.860 --> 41:20.580
Bobby Blackwool says it only happened once.

41:20.580 --> 41:24.580
I never did it again yet in regards to us stealing from me.

41:24.580 --> 41:28.720
Uh, anyway, so yeah, if you, if you owned No Man's Sky at some point, you really should

41:28.720 --> 41:29.720
check it out again.

41:29.720 --> 41:37.620
I think it's worth 25 bucks, 60 bucks, 30 on steam, 60 bucks, 30 is a good price too.

41:37.620 --> 41:38.620
60.

41:38.620 --> 41:39.620
I don't know.

41:39.620 --> 41:42.340
It would really depend on how you feel about the genre.

41:42.340 --> 41:46.980
Like if you know what you're getting into, you like sandbox games.

41:46.980 --> 41:52.100
This is, you know, don't be like the people that got all pissed off when they bought this

41:52.100 --> 41:55.460
game the first time because they didn't really know what they were getting into.

41:55.460 --> 41:56.460
You know what I mean?

41:56.460 --> 41:57.460
And I just bought it.

41:57.460 --> 41:58.460
Did you really?

41:58.460 --> 41:59.460
It was half price.

41:59.460 --> 42:01.460
Oh, but you have it on PC.

42:01.460 --> 42:02.460
No, no.

42:02.460 --> 42:03.460
I have it on PC.

42:03.460 --> 42:05.980
So, oh, but sadly you can't play with us cause you're on PC.

42:05.980 --> 42:06.980
But that's okay.

42:06.980 --> 42:08.200
Well then I'll refund it.

42:08.200 --> 42:09.460
I'll probably double dip.

42:09.460 --> 42:10.900
Well, you should still play.

42:10.900 --> 42:12.180
I think you'd like it.

42:12.180 --> 42:13.820
Alan's on PC.

42:13.820 --> 42:15.180
You should get him to play.

42:15.180 --> 42:16.180
So anyway.

42:16.180 --> 42:17.180
Alright.

42:17.180 --> 42:24.140
If there's anyone else on PC, you should meet up with Dark Sakura.

42:24.140 --> 42:25.140
Let's see.

42:25.140 --> 42:27.220
Oh, they're talking about Pokemon.

42:27.220 --> 42:31.900
I'm like, the planet, like any Blissey, is 365 hit points and a pain in the ass to take

42:31.900 --> 42:32.900
down.

42:32.900 --> 42:33.900
There you go.

42:33.900 --> 42:34.900
Brad from Pod Culture's on PC.

42:34.900 --> 42:36.940
So I'm sure there's some people also on PC.

42:36.940 --> 42:40.980
I wish they would speak to each other, but we know how Sony is with cross play right

42:40.980 --> 42:43.100
now and it makes me very cross.

42:43.100 --> 42:44.100
Anyway.

42:44.320 --> 42:46.180
There you go with our gaming weeks.

42:46.180 --> 42:47.580
Some quick announcements.

42:47.580 --> 42:53.160
There will be no show the weekend of August, I'm trying to remember off the top of my head

42:53.160 --> 42:54.160
or does it have been September?

42:54.160 --> 42:56.060
No, it'll be September 2nd at that point.

42:56.060 --> 43:01.020
There'll be no show September 2nd because I will be at Dragon Con and I'm very excited

43:01.020 --> 43:02.020
about that.

43:02.020 --> 43:06.540
I had a great time at Dragon Con last year and the last what, six years I've been.

43:06.540 --> 43:08.920
So excited for Dragon Con this year.

43:08.920 --> 43:13.300
Hoping to be able to tell you guys very soon about some panels I'll be working with and

43:13.300 --> 43:14.500
I hope to see you guys there.

43:14.500 --> 43:16.700
But there will be no show Labor Day weekend, September 2nd.

43:16.700 --> 43:17.700
I'll be at Sleep Con.

43:17.700 --> 43:18.700
You'll be at Sleep Con?

43:18.700 --> 43:19.700
Nap Con?

43:19.700 --> 43:20.700
Nap Con.

43:20.700 --> 43:21.700
Sounds like fun.

43:21.700 --> 43:24.020
Well, with a nice long weekend, you guys can do, you know, other stuff too.

43:24.020 --> 43:27.140
So what didn't you, weren't you saying you might hit up SAC Anime because I know that's

43:27.140 --> 43:28.140
that same weekend.

43:28.140 --> 43:29.140
So.

43:29.140 --> 43:30.140
Not this SAC Anime.

43:30.140 --> 43:31.140
I'm planning on January.

43:31.140 --> 43:32.140
Gotcha.

43:32.140 --> 43:33.140
Gotcha.

43:33.140 --> 43:35.060
I'm going to redo my Jill Valentine costume.

43:35.060 --> 43:36.060
Oh, fun.

43:36.060 --> 43:37.060
Good times.

43:37.060 --> 43:38.900
Don't end up a Jill sandwich.

43:38.900 --> 43:39.900
All right.

43:39.900 --> 43:41.660
Let's get into some gaming news.

43:41.700 --> 43:44.300
Loki, what, what else happened in games this week?

43:44.300 --> 43:45.300
All right.

43:45.300 --> 43:49.860
So this week, uh, we had Nintendo suing pirates.

43:49.860 --> 43:50.860
Yeah.

43:50.860 --> 43:56.500
I'm surprised it's taken so long to do that, but, um, apparently they have filed lawsuits

43:56.500 --> 44:03.380
against two ROM sites, one called Love ROMs and the other one LoveRetro.co, which are

44:03.380 --> 44:11.140
both operated by some guy named Jacob Matthias and are built entirely on the brazen and mass

44:11.180 --> 44:15.420
scale infringement and Nintendo's intellectual property rights.

44:15.420 --> 44:19.820
I've never heard of these sites and I know I don't use these sites for getting ROMs,

44:19.820 --> 44:23.220
so I'm kind of surprised that this is who they targeted first.

44:23.220 --> 44:28.260
I think one of these sites, maybe both of them, the big difference that I noticed that

44:28.260 --> 44:33.100
probably made them a target was the fact that you could play the games right there in the

44:33.100 --> 44:36.580
browser, like the emulator and the game were both together.

44:36.580 --> 44:37.580
It was like an in-browser emulator.

44:37.580 --> 44:40.580
I've been looking at, has the same thing.

44:40.580 --> 44:41.580
No, I know.

44:41.580 --> 44:42.580
I know.

44:42.580 --> 44:43.580
Please.

44:43.580 --> 44:44.580
It's like porn.

44:44.580 --> 44:45.580
There's ROM sites everywhere.

44:45.580 --> 44:50.580
So, you know, this is clearly some type of scare move by Nintendo.

44:50.580 --> 44:51.580
I don't know.

44:51.580 --> 44:56.500
It's weird because look, I, I don't want to say like, like the reality is when you get

44:56.500 --> 45:01.820
into this whole business with ROMs, you are getting into this real gray area when it comes

45:01.820 --> 45:02.820
to legality.

45:02.820 --> 45:04.640
You're just going to push it underground more.

45:04.640 --> 45:06.800
It's just going to go into torrents instead.

45:06.800 --> 45:09.940
You're just going to have to download the whole ROM sets instead.

45:09.940 --> 45:13.020
And they're not solving any problem.

45:13.020 --> 45:15.500
They're just kind of sweeping it under the rug basically.

45:15.500 --> 45:19.220
It's like, Oh yeah, you're not going to eliminate piracy of your ROMs on the internet.

45:19.220 --> 45:22.980
And what's the point even cause you don't have your fucking virtual console anymore.

45:22.980 --> 45:24.560
Well on they're gearing up for that.

45:24.560 --> 45:25.560
We know that.

45:25.560 --> 45:26.560
Right.

45:26.560 --> 45:30.380
I'm gearing up for that announcement any day now.

45:30.380 --> 45:31.980
What's it, when's it coming out again?

45:31.980 --> 45:36.260
How many weeks do we have for them to make that fucking announcement?

45:36.260 --> 45:38.020
So here's the problem.

45:38.020 --> 45:39.940
It's the year 2018.

45:39.940 --> 45:41.300
Okay.

45:41.300 --> 45:47.300
I know I have been using ROMs and NES emulators since I was in college in 1998.

45:47.300 --> 45:50.040
So like those things have been around for at least 20 years.

45:50.040 --> 45:52.740
And I know Nintendo has enforced some of this in the past.

45:52.740 --> 45:53.740
It's fine.

45:53.740 --> 45:57.820
But it just seems a little weird where it's like, why now all of a sudden, and as much

45:57.820 --> 46:03.100
as you're sassing what I'm saying here, I do think a part of it is because Nintendo

46:03.100 --> 46:09.060
is about to unleash Switch's version of the retro gaming, whatever it is.

46:09.060 --> 46:12.460
And so they're setting an example, they're making an example of these to try to scare

46:12.460 --> 46:13.980
other people off from it.

46:13.980 --> 46:15.020
But I don't necessarily disagree.

46:15.020 --> 46:19.280
And I don't want to come off as, Oh, I completely like, I get it.

46:19.280 --> 46:21.180
This is like a legal gray area.

46:21.180 --> 46:22.600
It's not even really a gray area.

46:22.600 --> 46:26.260
Like you are like, you're not supposed to be doing this now where I think it is a gray

46:26.260 --> 46:32.780
area is well, but if I bought these games, you know, but cause you know, with, with the

46:32.780 --> 46:38.140
patent having expired on the Nintendo hardware technology, something like a retron five,

46:38.140 --> 46:40.140
which is completely legal to loan.

46:40.140 --> 46:41.140
What is that doing?

46:41.140 --> 46:45.140
It's dumping your cartridges to a PC format and emulating there on the spot, right?

46:45.140 --> 46:49.620
So I mean like with stuff I already own, it shouldn't be as big of an issue.

46:49.620 --> 46:52.420
And I understand, and I'm sure there's going to be those who want to play devil's advocate

46:52.420 --> 46:53.420
and shadow.

46:53.420 --> 46:54.420
Like, no, that's still legal.

46:54.420 --> 46:55.420
But look, I get it.

46:55.420 --> 46:56.420
I get it.

46:56.420 --> 46:57.820
But I don't know.

46:57.820 --> 47:00.660
There's also something about kind of like what you were alluding to where it's like,

47:00.660 --> 47:07.060
how much money is Nintendo really losing on this whole thing?

47:07.060 --> 47:09.980
Especially for people that just want to play games that they already own.

47:09.980 --> 47:16.020
Probably less money than they spent on lawyers for this.

47:16.020 --> 47:17.020
It's hard to tell.

47:17.020 --> 47:18.020
I don't know.

47:18.020 --> 47:23.420
Like when it comes to emulating games, I find also that nothing really beats the real thing.

47:23.420 --> 47:24.700
Um, no, granted.

47:24.700 --> 47:26.420
I like the classic NES.

47:26.420 --> 47:27.540
I like the virtual console.

47:27.540 --> 47:30.380
I realize those are emulated, but nothing really beats the real thing.

47:31.100 --> 47:36.380
I've downloaded the whole Nintendo ROM set like dozens of times, and I still buy their

47:36.380 --> 47:38.500
shit on virtual console.

47:38.500 --> 47:43.860
The only person that's keeping money out of Nintendo's pockets right now is Nintendo.

47:43.860 --> 47:49.340
Because you're not providing me a way to give you money for the game that I want.

47:49.340 --> 47:53.460
So why are you going out through these ROM sites?

47:53.460 --> 47:57.420
It's not like you, hey, put out the virtual console and nothing's selling because everybody's

47:57.420 --> 47:59.260
just downloading ROMs for free.

47:59.260 --> 48:00.260
That's not what's fucking happening.

48:00.260 --> 48:05.220
What's fucking happening is you're not selling the games in the first place.

48:05.220 --> 48:07.260
I can't give you the money, Nintendo.

48:07.260 --> 48:10.100
Why do you hate money so much?

48:10.100 --> 48:14.780
Do you think part of it has to do with the classic NES hacking?

48:14.780 --> 48:15.780
Just throwing it out there?

48:15.780 --> 48:20.860
They should have fixed it when either the Super NES came out or when they re-released

48:20.860 --> 48:21.860
the NES.

48:21.860 --> 48:24.020
They could have fixed that shit, but they didn't.

48:24.020 --> 48:25.860
Well, but let's be real, Loki.

48:25.860 --> 48:27.340
A, we all know hackers gonna hack.

48:27.340 --> 48:28.340
They're never gonna fix them.

48:28.340 --> 48:32.700
B, if those things are running on Linux, that's especially so, that they were never gonna

48:32.700 --> 48:34.020
fix those things.

48:34.020 --> 48:38.300
As long as they were running Linux, people were always going to be able to backdoor their

48:38.300 --> 48:40.900
way into those things and put whatever they want on them.

48:40.900 --> 48:44.100
Which interestingly enough, I still haven't done with my classic NES.

48:44.100 --> 48:46.220
I haven't decided if that's something I want to do or not.

48:46.220 --> 48:47.220
You should.

48:47.220 --> 48:48.220
It's super easy.

48:48.220 --> 48:49.220
I know.

48:49.220 --> 48:50.220
I know.

48:50.220 --> 48:51.220
But I don't know.

48:51.220 --> 48:53.340
Part of me kind of likes that it's as like a collectible.

48:53.340 --> 48:54.340
It's untouched.

48:54.340 --> 48:55.340
It's the way it is.

48:55.760 --> 48:59.740
If I want to play any of that other stuff, I have it all on PC because I got it years

48:59.740 --> 49:00.740
ago.

49:00.740 --> 49:01.740
You know what I mean?

49:01.740 --> 49:06.460
But I don't find that I, I guess I don't find that I play a lot of that stuff on PC.

49:06.460 --> 49:10.260
Like when I go through my emulator collection on PC, I'll play something for like five minutes

49:10.260 --> 49:11.880
and I'll be like, cool, next.

49:11.880 --> 49:16.060
You know, I don't really play those games as like start to finish.

49:16.060 --> 49:19.220
Like the NES controller to actually play stuff.

49:19.220 --> 49:20.220
True.

49:20.220 --> 49:21.220
True.

49:21.220 --> 49:24.060
You could just hack it and you wouldn't even notice it.

49:24.060 --> 49:26.820
You just, you just push in guardian legend.

49:26.820 --> 49:29.940
You wouldn't even notice that anything's different.

49:29.940 --> 49:33.340
It would be all, it looks exactly the same.

49:33.340 --> 49:36.340
You just, it's just, now you have guardian legend in there.

49:36.340 --> 49:40.380
Uh, bonds, double 06 and chat says, Rob wants to keep his collection of Virgin for as long

49:40.380 --> 49:41.380
as possible.

49:41.380 --> 49:42.540
Keep it pure Rob.

49:42.540 --> 49:43.540
That's right.

49:43.540 --> 49:50.300
I don't want, I don't want your dirty internet hands touching, touching my daughter.

49:50.300 --> 49:58.700
Uh, Brad from pod culture also says it's a super easy to, I guess, hack those things.

49:58.700 --> 50:04.500
So Brad from pod culture suggests you sneak in and hack it while I'm away at dragon con.

50:04.500 --> 50:07.660
Now that's mean no touching my stuff while I'm not here.

50:07.660 --> 50:12.060
Maybe I'm going to now, now Brad, I'm going to take my classic NES to pod culture.

50:12.060 --> 50:14.940
I'm going to say if I take it to him, he'll hack it.

50:14.940 --> 50:18.900
I'm going to take my classic NES to dragon con because it is small enough to fit in that

50:18.900 --> 50:19.900
thing.

50:19.900 --> 50:20.900
Just so look, you can't touch it.

50:20.900 --> 50:28.620
I'm not driving over here to hack that thing is not a thing that is on any sort of priority.

50:28.620 --> 50:32.980
All right, let's move on and talk about, uh, changes and other change in gaming.

50:32.980 --> 50:36.940
And this kind of has to do with something that's been an argument, I guess for the past

50:36.940 --> 50:37.940
year or so.

50:37.940 --> 50:39.500
And that has to do with loot boxes.

50:39.500 --> 50:45.420
Well, uh, turn 10, the developer of forza, motorsport seven has announced that prize

50:45.420 --> 50:49.560
crates will be being removed from forza motorsports seven.

50:49.560 --> 50:51.420
This is a game that is already out.

50:51.420 --> 50:56.940
Uh, they're going to take out the prize crates, uh, for now, uh, right now, cars are completely

50:56.940 --> 50:58.540
out of the prize crates.

50:58.540 --> 51:01.020
There are no competitive advantage to them.

51:01.020 --> 51:06.140
There are now only cosmetic items like driver gear and badges and mods that can increase

51:06.140 --> 51:07.580
rewards in single player.

51:07.580 --> 51:10.940
There used to be cars that were exclusive in prize crates.

51:10.940 --> 51:12.580
Those can now be bought normally.

51:12.580 --> 51:15.980
Um, what's interesting though, I think what makes this a little bit different is that

51:15.980 --> 51:21.860
the price crates, uh, were never on sale for real money in the games marketplace.

51:21.860 --> 51:27.140
It looked like it was all set up for that, but something stopped them from turning that

51:27.140 --> 51:28.140
on.

51:28.140 --> 51:30.660
I wonder what that could have been at the end of last year when forza motorsport came

51:30.660 --> 51:31.660
out.

51:31.660 --> 51:36.060
I don't know, but they never turned on selling these things for real money.

51:36.060 --> 51:39.260
So instead I'm assuming the price crates are must be things that you can like kind of win

51:39.260 --> 51:40.260
from in game.

51:40.260 --> 51:41.260
Here's what you have to do.

51:41.260 --> 51:42.620
You have to look at one thing.

51:42.620 --> 51:44.340
One, is your game free to play?

51:44.340 --> 51:48.140
No, then get that shit out of that fucking game.

51:48.140 --> 51:49.980
All right.

51:49.980 --> 51:54.340
Uh, so, um, they're going to step further though now that they, even though they're

51:54.340 --> 51:58.020
not selling these things anymore, uh, they are just getting rid of them.

51:58.020 --> 52:04.140
Also, uh, paid tokens will not be in forza motorsport seven or horizon four.

52:04.140 --> 52:09.100
Uh, so even if you don't play the mainline forza games, maybe you play the, uh, horizon

52:09.100 --> 52:13.380
spin off games for coming out again, October, I know I'm excited too.

52:13.380 --> 52:18.840
I'm really excited about that to register participation for this week's episode of orange

52:18.840 --> 52:24.140
on radio at vog network.com use the passphrase side.

52:24.140 --> 52:29.860
So um, yeah, forza horizon four will be coming out in October and uh, these will not be a

52:29.860 --> 52:30.860
part of that.

52:30.860 --> 52:36.980
So they're, they're learning their loot box lesson now so that forza horizon can be pure.

52:36.980 --> 52:37.980
Isn't that nice?

52:37.980 --> 52:38.980
Very refreshing.

52:38.980 --> 52:39.980
Good for doing the right thing.

52:39.980 --> 52:42.980
I'm not patting you on the back though for it because you should have fucking been doing

52:42.980 --> 52:43.980
this all along.

52:43.980 --> 52:48.700
Uh, Bobby in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com confirms it's October 2nd is the day it comes

52:48.700 --> 52:49.700
out.

52:49.700 --> 52:50.700
That's even.

52:50.700 --> 52:51.700
Hooray.

52:51.700 --> 52:52.700
Hooray.

52:52.700 --> 52:53.700
I love me.

52:53.700 --> 52:54.700
So we're still disappointed by Nintendo's announcement.

52:54.700 --> 52:55.700
We still have horizon four.

52:55.700 --> 52:56.700
That's right.

52:56.700 --> 52:58.300
There's still something to look forward to.

52:58.300 --> 53:01.780
Someone's got our back on the horizon.

53:01.780 --> 53:04.560
I'm not, I'm not even going to.

53:04.560 --> 53:07.020
Next up on the horizon, dark Sakura.

53:07.060 --> 53:11.820
Well, there are going to be some new arcade cabinets released for old games.

53:11.820 --> 53:17.720
They um, are from arcade one up and they will have different games featured for each package.

53:17.720 --> 53:20.940
There's going to be a centipede cabinet that has centipede millipede missile command and

53:20.940 --> 53:21.940
crystal castles.

53:21.940 --> 53:27.580
So I guess all the track ball games, um, an asteroids cabinet that has asteroids, tempest,

53:27.580 --> 53:33.500
major havoc and lunar Lander, uh, then one with rampage defender, joust and gauntlet.

53:33.500 --> 53:38.420
And then a street fighter two championship cabinet, which is a street fighter two championship

53:38.420 --> 53:43.180
edition super street fighter two new challengers and super street fighter two turbo.

53:43.180 --> 53:47.440
And then the final fight cabinet, which is final fight 1944, the loop master ghosts and

53:47.440 --> 53:49.020
goblins and Strider.

53:49.020 --> 53:57.500
Um, they're about 400 a pop and they are three quarter size of the original cabinets and

53:57.500 --> 54:01.180
it will come with a cabinet riser and a potential stool.

54:01.180 --> 54:02.180
He needed to build them.

54:02.340 --> 54:04.660
They're like Ikea for arcade cabinets.

54:04.660 --> 54:05.660
Yeah.

54:05.660 --> 54:06.660
I mean, it's like a lot of furniture.

54:06.660 --> 54:07.660
Pretty good.

54:07.660 --> 54:08.660
Yeah.

54:08.660 --> 54:09.660
So I mentioned they're kind of like this.

54:09.660 --> 54:11.700
I mean, I, sorry you guys, it's a radio show, but I imagine they're kind of like this thing

54:11.700 --> 54:13.700
that we have in studio, which was at Loki's old work.

54:13.700 --> 54:15.700
I mentioned they're kind of like that.

54:15.700 --> 54:17.580
That's a bar top cabinet though.

54:17.580 --> 54:18.580
It's an actual standup.

54:18.580 --> 54:21.700
Have you seen the smaller cabinets that they have at California extreme?

54:21.700 --> 54:22.700
I actually haven't.

54:22.700 --> 54:25.100
They look like they're for small teenagers.

54:25.100 --> 54:26.100
Yeah.

54:26.100 --> 54:27.100
That's about the size.

54:27.100 --> 54:28.100
Interesting.

54:28.100 --> 54:29.100
Okay.

54:29.220 --> 54:31.980
Probably about five foot.

54:31.980 --> 54:32.980
Yeah.

54:32.980 --> 54:33.980
I don't know.

54:33.980 --> 54:37.220
Like I would almost be interested in getting one, but the price is a little high.

54:37.220 --> 54:44.180
You know, it's hard to justify when I know our cabinet, I don't think that's with a 17

54:44.180 --> 54:45.180
inch LCD monitor.

54:45.180 --> 54:46.180
Yeah, that's true.

54:46.180 --> 54:48.700
And that's the monitor that probably makes the price so high.

54:48.700 --> 54:49.700
You know what I mean?

54:49.700 --> 54:50.700
It's basically a television.

54:50.700 --> 54:56.460
I don't see why it's high at all because you can to buy a full size arcade cabinet sometimes

54:56.460 --> 55:04.020
without the monitor is still somewhere between 300 to, you know, 700 depending on the cabinet.

55:04.020 --> 55:05.020
Yeah, I guess that's true.

55:05.020 --> 55:06.460
And that's one game.

55:06.460 --> 55:10.820
Maybe I'm also thinking like about space just from the perspective of, again, because this

55:10.820 --> 55:13.920
thing is here and just in general, I really don't.

55:13.920 --> 55:16.660
It's kind of like the same conundrum I have with pinball machines in here.

55:16.660 --> 55:20.100
As much as I would love to own my own pinball machine, I'm like, there's no space.

55:20.100 --> 55:21.980
Keep in mind a pinball, you're looking in the thousands.

55:21.980 --> 55:23.220
Oh yeah, no, I know that.

55:23.220 --> 55:24.300
I know that.

55:24.300 --> 55:27.360
So I don't know.

55:27.360 --> 55:32.220
It's one of those things where it's like, if I had more of that space and the desire,

55:32.220 --> 55:33.220
I might do it.

55:33.220 --> 55:34.220
Especially that Final Fight cabinet.

55:34.220 --> 55:35.220
Sounds like the best one.

55:35.220 --> 55:36.220
The one with Strider on it.

55:36.220 --> 55:37.640
Yeah, the one with Strider on it.

55:37.640 --> 55:39.100
That sounds like the best one for sure.

55:39.100 --> 55:42.500
And again, I already have an Ultracade, so.

55:42.500 --> 55:43.500
Do you kick it?

55:43.500 --> 55:44.500
Sometimes.

55:44.500 --> 55:45.500
Okay, good.

55:45.500 --> 55:46.500
All right.

55:46.500 --> 55:48.380
Well, I think it is a neat little collection thing.

55:48.380 --> 55:52.860
It is interesting too, how like Walmart is selling these and like Walmart has been in

55:52.860 --> 55:54.580
like the classic arcade business.

55:54.580 --> 55:55.980
I loved your little games again.

55:55.980 --> 55:57.060
No, that's fine.

55:57.060 --> 55:59.480
But like, and so there's the itty bitty way.

55:59.480 --> 56:01.480
Those are like keychain itty bitty games, right?

56:01.480 --> 56:02.480
Or how big are those?

56:02.480 --> 56:03.480
Well, no.

56:03.480 --> 56:05.980
Yeah, the ones I got you were about half as tall.

56:05.980 --> 56:06.980
Okay.

56:06.980 --> 56:11.820
And so she's pointing at the like the $20 ones that were like the tiny little cabinets

56:11.820 --> 56:17.420
that are out there too, with like Cuber and Asteroids and stuff.

56:17.420 --> 56:22.660
So yeah, so it's like Walmart is like in this classic retro arcade biz, all of a sudden

56:22.660 --> 56:24.060
it's very interesting.

56:24.060 --> 56:29.300
So going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

56:29.300 --> 56:31.700
Dark Tetsuya says Walmart is only $300.

56:31.700 --> 56:35.380
I guess that's what they do is undercut everybody else.

56:35.380 --> 56:38.620
Dark Tetsuya says, I think they're a little bit bigger than the bar top.

56:38.620 --> 56:40.720
The risers are supposed to help.

56:40.720 --> 56:44.000
These will work right out of the box after you put them together.

56:44.000 --> 56:48.460
Getting a cabinet off Craigslist, you might get a mostly working machine.

56:48.460 --> 56:52.820
It is, I will say though, it is still my dream someday to own a baby Pac-Man machine

56:52.820 --> 56:56.780
that is still like the thing that I want more than anything.

56:56.780 --> 57:01.780
So all right, well, let's move on with some more news.

57:01.780 --> 57:02.780
Loki.

57:02.780 --> 57:04.440
All right.

57:04.440 --> 57:13.660
So IntiCrate is actually looking at, they want to remake Zelda 2.

57:13.660 --> 57:18.300
And you may remember them from such wonderful games on the Nintendo platforms, like Blaster

57:18.300 --> 57:25.180
Master Zero, or they also had, oh yeah, they also did the bloodsitting curse of the moon

57:25.180 --> 57:26.820
thing that was on there in Mighty Gunvel.

57:26.820 --> 57:29.340
So they did Mighty No. 9 too.

57:29.340 --> 57:35.500
Yeah, it was, yeah, unfortunately it's okay, but everything else is good.

57:35.500 --> 57:36.500
So that's fine.

57:36.500 --> 57:41.980
But apparently, you know, saying that, yeah, he would love to make it a new adventure of

57:41.980 --> 57:44.220
Link for the modern era.

57:45.220 --> 57:48.220
One that doesn't play like crap.

57:48.220 --> 57:50.220
Uh, yeah, hopefully.

57:50.220 --> 57:52.220
I'm sorry, I don't like Zelda 2.

57:52.220 --> 57:54.220
Dan really likes it though.

57:54.220 --> 58:00.220
But I'd be cool like with a game that didn't suck that was that style, like a, I don't

58:00.220 --> 58:01.220
know.

58:01.220 --> 58:03.260
I like Zelda 2.

58:03.260 --> 58:04.260
I get it's different.

58:04.260 --> 58:05.940
I get why it puts people off.

58:05.940 --> 58:09.460
I totally get why it puts people off, but I really like it for what it is.

58:09.460 --> 58:13.620
And I would so be on board with IntiCrate's getting it, but I just don't think, Nintendo

58:13.620 --> 58:18.820
is, well, I'm about to say Nintendo is never going to let another company touch one of

58:18.820 --> 58:20.260
their biggest properties.

58:20.260 --> 58:25.020
But as those words leave my mouth, I then remember Metroid Other M. I then remember,

58:25.020 --> 58:28.180
well, heck that, uh, latest Metroid game, you know?

58:28.180 --> 58:32.860
So like it's, it's not like it's that uncommon, but it's just like Nintendo letting someone

58:32.860 --> 58:35.140
else make a Zelda.

58:35.140 --> 58:36.700
I don't know about that.

58:36.700 --> 58:37.700
I know.

58:37.700 --> 58:40.200
I'm just like, oh, I would love to see it.

58:40.200 --> 58:43.840
Didn't Capcom help with like one of the four swords adventures or something like that?

58:43.840 --> 58:50.480
Or I thought that like they had other, they've had third parties do things, but I think it

58:50.480 --> 58:54.000
was reaching out to the third parties for that.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
Reach out.

58:55.000 --> 58:59.320
It's not like, you know, more Zelda games would be a terrible thing.

58:59.320 --> 59:03.720
Well, I just want to see what IntiCrate's is going to be working on next because I think

59:03.720 --> 59:05.040
they they've been doing some great stuff.

59:05.040 --> 59:06.640
Obviously I love that Blaster Master Zero.

59:06.640 --> 59:10.920
That was a great, you know, especially because I was worried about Blaster Master because

59:10.920 --> 59:13.320
you know, some of the other reimaginings have not been so great.

59:13.320 --> 59:14.920
I think they really did a good job with that one.

59:14.920 --> 59:19.080
So I'm, uh, I, you know what, if they want to try their hand at Zelda two, what's the

59:19.080 --> 59:20.200
worst that could happen?

59:20.200 --> 59:25.080
It can't possibly be as bad as Zelda, um, 3D Oh,

59:25.080 --> 59:26.080
exactly.

59:26.080 --> 59:27.080
I know that.

59:27.080 --> 59:29.800
Listen, that was a long time ago.

59:29.800 --> 59:33.280
I think you learned your lesson with, you know, licensing that out to third parties

59:33.280 --> 59:40.000
on other systems and also movie licensing rights, but it's a different, it's a different

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
decade now.

59:41.000 --> 59:45.080
I mean, we can put that all behind us and try again.

59:45.080 --> 59:46.080
It's a new decade.

59:46.080 --> 59:48.080
Let's come together and try to do this again.

59:48.080 --> 59:49.080
All right.

59:49.080 --> 59:55.080
Well, uh, also for a new decade, uh, we are having, uh, a, I think a kind of a popular

59:55.080 --> 59:59.160
music game from, from some people, for some people, I don't know if everybody's ever experienced

59:59.160 --> 01:00:05.080
this game, but it's a game called Taiko no Tatsujin, uh, this is, uh, was once released

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:09.640
here in the States as Taiko Drum Master, um, because that's what it, that's what Taiko

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:10.640
no Tatsujin means.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.360
Um, but this, I think it was released on the Wii, I want to say, as Taiko Drum Masters.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.360
That sound right, you guys?

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:16.360
I think so.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:21.640
Uh, well, it's going to be coming out again, uh, Taiko no Tatsujin, Drum Session and Taiko

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:26.560
no Tatsujin, Drum and Fun, uh, they're going to come out for PS4 and Nintendo Switch.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.280
And, uh, I think one is for PS4, the other's Nintendo Switch.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:32.440
They're going to come out actually in Western and European territories.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:36.320
So we're going to get a localized release of these games on November 2nd.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.320
And that's pretty cool.

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:40.720
Um, there's a whole little post on the PlayStation blog about it.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:44.520
Uh, they're going to bring in some songs from, uh, some things you might've heard of like

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:50.640
Neon Genesis Evangelion, uh, Vocaloid Producers, I'm assuming that means Masunomiku, uh, Disney

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.040
Favorites from Zootopia and Frozen.

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:57.960
Although if Let It Go is one of the songs, I will probably put a hole in my drum.

01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:59.360
So I don't know about that.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:04.440
Um, but anyway, also songs from other Namco properties like Tekken, the Tales series,

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:08.120
Idolmaster, you know, what's missing from that list?

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:14.680
Katamari Damacy, just saying, anyway, the PS4 has ranked mode and there will be motion

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.020
controls in the Nintendo Switch version.

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:22.740
Although honestly, if there is not a physical drum, don't do it because, uh, the whole like

01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:27.100
waving the Wiimotes around, I realize we're in like HD motion detection now and this stuff,

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.700
it's just, it's not going to be the same.

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.340
It's not going to be the same if it's not a tangible drum.

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:36.420
Anyway, uh, no word on if the controller peripheral is coming out in the West.

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:40.980
So if there's no official controller, you may just have to play this on PlayStation

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:44.260
4, like with X's and O's and that, I don't know if that would be the same.

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:49.020
Anyway, apparently Bandai Namco did confirm later in the week, there is no set plan to

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:51.540
bring that drum controller to North America.

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:56.260
I don't know guys, that kind of loses a lot of it for me.

01:01:56.260 --> 01:02:02.140
Anyway, it will have a physical release in America on both PS4 and Switch, digital only

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:03.140
in Europe.

01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:06.020
So it will not, although you'll get a localized version, you'll only be able to get it on

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:12.320
the store, uh, which is, I mean, kind of like how they released a DJ Max on PS4 over here.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:13.820
So there you go.

01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:18.020
Anyway, let's move on to a different sort of story, but something a little more positive.

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.020
Right, Darsakra?

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:26.220
There was a study that was conducted at Harvard Medical School in 2017 that was released that

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:32.820
talks about how loneliness can be more detrimental to your health than smoking would be.

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:38.780
And talked about increasing the relationships through your friends and family members through

01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:39.780
games.

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:43.780
And it was even saying that video games contribute to that as well.

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:49.980
They also found out that the games have the ability to change your brain structurally

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:52.380
and functionally.

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:57.660
It can promote neurogenesis, which is the growth of new neurons, and neuroplasticity,

01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:02.180
which is the change in neural pathways and synapses.

01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:05.420
Basically it keeps your brain alert and functioning well.

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:10.700
There are also showing in another study in 2017 that was published in frontiers in human

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:21.020
neuroscience that gamers who got together to play games like Baduke or Go had an increase

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:23.580
in their gray matter.

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:33.180
And a decrease in the, I'm going to mispronounce this, amygdala, which I guess is a good thing.

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:37.740
But basically the gray matter increase in the nucleus acumen leads to more positive

01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:40.460
experiences and enthusiasm.

01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:45.780
The decrease in gray matter in the amygdala leads to stress reduction and an increased

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:46.780
calmness.

01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:53.100
But also, especially with action video games, they found that it increased your gray matter

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:59.780
and functional connectivity in other regions of the brain.

01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:05.260
Especially into the cerebral cortex, which is responsible for self-awareness and present

01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:07.180
moments awareness.

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:13.420
So basically it leads to better decision making and better intuition.

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:18.380
Board games are really good for increasing strength in the hippocampus and the prefrontal

01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:25.100
cortex, which usually improve cognitive functions that affect IQ, memory, and information retention

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:26.720
and problem solving.

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:32.460
So basically playing games of strategy and playing video games help increase your memory,

01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:43.660
increase your mood for the most part, and also can functionally affect your brain biologically.

01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:47.980
Can they make you as cool as smoking cigarettes?

01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:48.980
Stop it now.

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:49.980
Stop.

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:56.740
Well one of the other things too is that playing collaborative games improves your computational

01:04:56.740 --> 01:05:04.820
thinking, including skills affecting logic, distributed processing, debugging, and simulation

01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:06.040
and algorithm building.

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:14.240
So basically collaborative strategy games will increase your ability to code or pick

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:15.240
up coding.

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:22.800
Yeah, you know, and I remember when I was younger.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:26.720
Maybe some of these tricks we use on young children can also work on Loki, who knows?

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:33.280
But I remember when I was younger, when Apple IIe's and Commodore 64's were all the rage,

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:34.980
all the schools had Apple IIe's, right?

01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:37.060
That was like the school computer.

01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:41.220
And they would actually have, I don't know if it was like the Parks and Rec or if it

01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:42.980
was like some type of summer school thing.

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:48.260
But I remember they would have nighttime classes on learn how to do basic programming on an

01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:49.400
Apple IIe.

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.420
I think a lot of it, I want to say, was logo.

01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:56.420
Now I'm sure, and not to be confused with a television network that brought us RuPaul's

01:05:56.420 --> 01:06:02.080
Drag Race, that's something very different, but logo was a programming language, like

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:06.400
in the 80s, that was on Apple IIe and I think they made versions of it for other things

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.400
as well.

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:09.600
And it was the whole thing where you had the turtle, it was a graphics drawing program,

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.600
right?

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.280
So you would do things like, and I don't remember all the instructions, some of you guys probably

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:20.400
remember this better, but it was like pen down, forward 30, turn 90, and it was like

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.400
you turn the angle.

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:24.780
But like what you could do is you could build like, I think there was maybe like if then

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:28.220
or there were ways to build loops so that when you wrote a certain thing, you could

01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:31.940
actually build like a spiral graph sort of thing where you get the turtle to turn a certain

01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:36.160
degrees, draw a square, he would make these really pretty shapes and you could like have

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.040
it change the colors.

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:41.660
And so you, but that's what I did when I was like seven years old that kind of like taught

01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:45.300
me about programming and I feel like some of that made me more smarter.

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:50.340
Well, here's the other good thing though about video games in particular, is that they're

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:55.760
actually showing that video games can help with children with dyslexia.

01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:05.220
And also other benefits, the big thing is increased, will increase metacognition.

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:11.080
So basically metacognition is thinking about thinking and part of meditation.

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:15.960
And they were showing that for children and adults, but mostly children who would play

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:22.900
games and then meditate and follow these in certain cycles, actually found other increase

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:33.580
in not just their cognition, but in their joy in participating in things.

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:39.740
So really I find it very fascinating, you know, we have this camp who likes to make

01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:47.080
video games the scapegoat for everything, but in the long run though, playing these

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:52.200
games are actually kind of good for you.

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.200
Who said more smarter?

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.200
I did.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:56.200
I was making it funny.

01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:02.080
I said, learning all that stuff at a young age made me more smarter.

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:06.800
You missed the joke because you were focused on your story.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:13.020
So anyhow, but Loki's response in chat said, I know it's smarter, I should have said more

01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:14.020
smarter.

01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:15.020
All right.

01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:18.260
Anyway, in all seriousness, let me get some comments in the chat.

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:24.860
Less dumb is legit to tell someone not to be, or to tell someone to be, like world be

01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:25.860
less dumb.

01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:26.860
Loki be less dumb.

01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:27.860
All right.

01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:32.800
Bobby Black Wolf in chat, who's not dumb at all, says the TI 85 calculator had a similar

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.540
drawing system logo.

01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:36.320
Here's another great thing I remember from younger.

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:38.080
I had a friend program pole position.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.080
Oh yeah.

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.080
You could do like mini games.

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.080
I remember there's a Tetris one floating around.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.080
You could do assembly on that son of a bitch.

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.080
Those things were powerful little things.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.080
Powerful little fuckers, weren't they?

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:48.080
Yeah, they sure were.

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.080
And yet-

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.080
And expensive.

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.080
They were expensive, especially at the time.

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:52.080
I could only afford an 82.

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.080
I feel like-

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:59.120
I have a TI 85 somewhere because I had to have it for, not chemistry, but algebra.

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.720
Do they still make TI 85s?

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:01.720
I feel like they probably do.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:02.720
Yes, they do.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:03.720
Yeah.

01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:06.260
And they're probably like 20 bucks now when-

01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:07.260
Nope.

01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:08.260
Oh really?

01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:09.260
No, they're still expensive.

01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:10.260
Hold on.

01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:11.260
I'll get you the price.

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:12.260
Really?

01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:13.260
I would have thought maybe because of the technology and everything.

01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:19.720
It's because they have a hold on that math market, and so it's like you pay up fuckers.

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:20.720
Game boy games ain't free anymore.

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:21.720
Okay, I take that back.

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:24.900
People are selling them for about 20 bucks to nine bucks on eBay.

01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:29.300
I think that's been replaced by the TA, I want to say by a different TI because I had

01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:30.300
a different one.

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.380
Maybe a TI 87 was the one I had?

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:33.380
Let me look real quick.

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:39.120
TI 82, and I remember I had to try to build a serial cable for it, and that was not fun.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:42.720
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, TI still corners the market on graphing calculators, so I'm

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.720
sure they must have some sort of patent or something that allows them to kind of do that.

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:46.720
You know what I mean?

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:49.360
I think though, nowadays though, I'd imagine that that would be coming down because couldn't

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:52.360
you just download an app for your phone to do the same damn shit?

01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:56.600
Well, okay, here's the thing, TI 84 is okay, that was the one I had in college.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:01.560
The problem with it is that, and I even asked my teacher about that because the iPhone has

01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:07.860
a graphing calculator built into it, but you can also use your iPhone for many other things,

01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:13.380
including looking up answers and using automatic tools, so they always had us put away our

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:15.420
phone and bust out the graphing calculator.

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:20.180
I get it, so you can use a graphing calculator on a test, but you can't use a phone on a

01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:21.180
test.

01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:22.180
Precisely.

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:23.180
Or you can write down your notes on the graphing calculator.

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:27.260
Yeah, I was going to say, if you put pole position on a graphing calculator, you could

01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:28.260
probably-

01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:29.260
I'm going to put the fucking internet.

01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:31.540
But I think the average person doesn't know how to do it.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:39.200
Yeah, and right now, the TI 84 graphing calculator is about 90 bucks.

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:44.560
Bobby, or excuse me, it's actually Bob Coffee in chat says, it's not a patent, it's educational

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:45.560
contracts.

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:46.560
Interesting.

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:50.400
Isn't that how Apple got through some of its darkest years too, like pre iPhone, iTunes,

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:51.400
and all that?

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:55.080
Like it was because it's educational contracts, like the fact that they were in every school,

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:59.480
every institution really kind of kept on going through some of the darker years of the company.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.720
This is crazy.

01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:03.940
Texas Instruments stock is at $112.

01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:04.940
Wow.

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:08.660
So, they're clearly doing something right.

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:13.180
Yeah, by not giving away tickets to movies.

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:14.180
Interesting.

01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:18.340
So, Bobby points out, Apple and TI did do the same thing with educational contracts.

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:22.420
He also said, and he brought up the same point that we eventually got to, that they won't

01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:26.860
let their kids have a phone out during the test, but I still programmed equations into

01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:27.980
my TI 85.

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:30.260
The program was named ZZZ.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:31.800
I was sneaky.

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:38.400
Well, Bobby Blackwell, if a true nerd would have named it ZZZT, I'm actually on the Texas

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:47.680
Instruments website and the TI 89 titanium, holy crap, it actually does wireframe and

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:52.040
you can kill a man with it.

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.960
TI 89 titanium.

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:58.040
That sounds like one of the weapons in the movie last night and they have a color one

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:02.020
now called the TI Nspire.

01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:03.020
Oh my God.

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:04.420
It's just absolutely crazy.

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:06.060
It's got CAD built in.

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:10.740
You tell me what other gaming podcast devolves into a conversation on graphing calculators.

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:11.740
Oh, I'm sure there's plenty.

01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:12.740
You find it.

01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:14.740
I'm sure there's plenty.

01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:15.740
Alright.

01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:19.980
This week we're focusing on the Texas Instruments.

01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:25.100
I think next year Dark Soccer should do the classic calculator of the month.

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.100
Girl.

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:27.100
Alright.

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.160
Alright.

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:32.520
This week it's Casio watch calculator.

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.520
Oh my God.

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.520
Okay.

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:40.360
We could fill 12 months of calculating because you, you could totally have the Casio watch.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.640
Oh my God.

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.120
That takes me fucking back.

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.620
The Casio watch calculators.

01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:47.520
And then I remember the one that looked like a little professor.

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.520
Do you guys know what I'm talking?

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.520
There was like a professor calculator.

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:51.860
It looked like a little dude with a mustache.

01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:52.860
Somebody's got to know what I'm talking about.

01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:55.180
This time we're doing your parents calculator.

01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:56.180
That's right.

01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:57.260
A rule.

01:12:57.260 --> 01:12:58.260
An abacus.

01:12:58.260 --> 01:12:59.260
Abacus.

01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:00.260
Yeah.

01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:01.760
You know what I could do though?

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:02.760
A speak in math.

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.760
Classic computer of the month.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:05.760
Okay.

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:10.760
I'll start off with the IBM 486.

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:11.760
Alright.

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:12.760
I'm loving it.

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:13.760
Anyway.

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.760
Uh, in the meantime we got to get to some more news so we can get to the actual classic

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:17.760
game of the week.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.160
But how about a new game first, Loki?

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:20.160
Yeah.

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.160
I'm actually kind of excited about this.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:24.060
I don't really care for the labo stuff cause well, okay.

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:25.060
I take that back.

01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:29.420
I care for the price of the labo stuff is what I really meant to say.

01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:34.080
But they have a new labo set that's going to be coming out and this one's basically

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:37.700
about driving or vehicles or whatever.

01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:41.860
So you can build three separate vehicles with it and they have like this different key that

01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:42.880
goes in there.

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:45.820
So there's like a driving one that actually has a foot pedal.

01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:52.340
There's like a submarine thing and an airplane joystick and that should be coming out.

01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:57.180
I don't know when the date is on that, but the trailer is pretty cool and we don't know

01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:03.020
the price yet, but I'm assuming it's going to be around the same price either 69 or $79.

01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:04.020
But neat.

01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:05.020
Oh, September.

01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:06.020
That's right.

01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:08.940
September is supposed to come out.

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:12.980
Just for the record, Dark Tetsuya found it cause that's, that's what our live listeners

01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:13.980
do.

01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:15.760
The calculator was called the little professor.

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:18.460
It was a little, little professor was the name of it.

01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:23.580
And his little hat is that, um, what did they call the screens that were like the real

01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:29.860
red glowing led or were they led LCD, but they were red and glowing and looking for

01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:30.860
evil.

01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:31.860
Yeah.

01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:35.540
They used to make alarm clocks out of those back in the day and it was like, it's 6am.

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:36.660
You're going to go to hell.

01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:38.740
Like that's what things look like in the dark.

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:39.740
Virtual boy.

01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:40.740
Yeah.

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:41.740
They still sell those.

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:42.740
What little professors?

01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:43.740
No, the clocks.

01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:44.740
Oh really?

01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:45.740
Oh my gosh.

01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:46.740
I have one for my son.

01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:47.740
All right.

01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:48.740
Both my kids have those.

01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:49.740
Scare.

01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:50.740
I'm young.

01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:51.740
All right.

01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:52.740
They're blue.

01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:53.740
I mean, they're not red.

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:59.060
Well, speaking of amazing computers and it's, I, it's almost like we planned it this way.

01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:06.380
Uh, the Commodore 64 mini is coming to the U S very cool about this.

01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:13.420
So, uh, the common, the C 64 mini is, uh, going to be loaded with ready for this 64

01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:15.540
classic titles.

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:19.420
Where did they pull that number out of the hat?

01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:23.660
Remember, remember just last week on this show when you couldn't remember how much memory

01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:30.340
was in a Commodore 64 Loki, I didn't have a Commodore 64, 64 kilobytes.

01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:35.200
That could, that 64 can admit anything anyway, it could have been the speed.

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:36.200
It could have been anything.

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:37.200
All right.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.200
Be quiet.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:42.100
Some of the notable titles include California games, winter games, impossible mission to,

01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:47.140
Oh, I hope the first one's there to, uh, Boulder dash, uh, jump man, pit stop to speedball

01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:52.900
to street sports, baseball, summer games to the temple of app, shy trilogy, uh, your radium.

01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:55.660
Like I know some of you guys are like, I've never heard of this shit.

01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:58.140
Those are all fucking classics that I just named right there.

01:15:58.140 --> 01:15:59.920
Amazing, amazing list of games there.

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.820
So of course it all connects via HTMI.

01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:06.540
Uh, and I guess right now, uh, October 9th is the date that they're targeting and you

01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:11.340
can get more details at the C 64.com.

01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:16.460
And if I remember right, you can still, you, because it actually is like a full functional

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:17.460
keyboard and everything.

01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:20.820
You can still use these like they are a Commodore 64.

01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:27.060
So yeah, they say complete with a fully working version of C 64 basic and a USB joystick.

01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:29.380
So I can actually start to write programs.

01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:31.920
I don't know how it's going to save or any of that stuff.

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:35.600
And I'm sure, I'm sure somebody's already figured it because I think this thing's already

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.020
been out in Europe where the Commodore 64 is even bigger.

01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:44.700
I'm sure somebody's thought of a way to like load their own C 64 discs and disc images

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:45.700
onto this thing.

01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:46.700
There's gotta be.

01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:52.140
So I can play like the C 64 games that I loved that nobody else loved, like the Dragon's

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:54.020
Lair games.

01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:58.300
I'm telling you the Dragon's Lair games, there was two of them because, um, and it's nothing

01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:02.420
like the Dragon's Lair arcade game because obviously the arcade game is too, it was too

01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:06.700
strong graphically, but the music in those games are some of my favorite chiptunes like

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:10.500
ever in like the C 64 era.

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:11.500
Anyway.

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:15.880
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, you don't even have to hack it.

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:18.260
They tell you exactly how to do it.

01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:23.340
A new firmware update will allow you to have more than just one D 64 file.

01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:27.220
Well that's pretty awesome, especially because I think one reason they kind of have to do

01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:32.500
this is that those disc images, like those magnetic discs are like eroding over time.

01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:34.740
Like those discs are not holding up all these years later.

01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:40.740
So are we going to be, are we going to be able to run Gios on this?

01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:41.740
You know what Gios is?

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:46.100
It made your Commodore 64 look just like a early, early Macintosh early cause it was

01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:52.060
like graphic evolution, something operating system, graphic enhanced, gravity enhanced

01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:53.060
operating system.

01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:54.060
Gios.

01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:55.060
Let's give it a gooey.

01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:56.060
Anyway.

01:17:56.060 --> 01:18:03.500
The only game I ever played on the Commodore 64 was kickstart motorcycle racing game.

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:04.500
Oh man.

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:05.500
I'm so excited.

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:08.700
I can't wait for this to come out because then I'm going to be hooking it up and like

01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:10.100
streaming all the things on Twitch.

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:13.140
I'm so excited cause I love color 64 anyway.

01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:18.380
The classic game of the week, however, dark soccer is going to dip into the gaming archives.

01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:22.460
Sadly not from the Commodore 64, but there's just so many things to pick from, you know,

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:25.200
so dark soccer has picked a mighty fine choice this week.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:29.100
I'm assuming it's gotta be something that came from California extreme.

01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:30.100
I don't know.

01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:31.100
Maybe.

01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:32.100
No.

01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:33.100
Oh wow.

01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:34.100
That's something that got inspired from that.

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:35.100
All right.

01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:36.100
Well then let's get to it.

01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:37.100
I already had an idea to do this one.

01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:38.100
I just put it off.

01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:39.100
All right.

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:42.220
So, uh, every week you jump in the vault and find a game that the kids should be playing

01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:43.220
this week.

01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:44.220
Dark soccer.

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:45.220
What should the kids be playing this week?

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:46.220
I think it's captain commando.

01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:47.220
Fuck yes.

01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:48.220
That game is awesome.

01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:49.220
Yes it is.

01:18:49.220 --> 01:19:00.140
And what people may not realize is that captain commando was supposed to have been the mascot

01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:01.860
for Capcom during that particular period.

01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:02.860
There had been earlier incarnations of him that eventually worked into the character

01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:03.860
we had in the video game.

01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:04.860
Um, so it came out in 1991.

01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:14.860
It was a futuristic side school and beat him up and it was released on the CP system.

01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:20.900
Um, that was actually the 17th title in the CP system and he was conceived again as their

01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:24.180
spokesperson to use in the late eighties.

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:28.220
So basically, um, you have four characters in this beat them up.

01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:31.740
You have captain commando, who is the leader of the team.

01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:36.420
Um, you have in the U S I'm going to give us things on the Japanese names.

01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:42.780
Mac the knife, who is also named Jannetty in the Japanese version, who is a mummy commando

01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:43.780
from outer space.

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:48.660
Um, he has this spinning attack, he's pretty fun.

01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:53.620
And of course the U S name came after the song that's mac the knife.

01:19:53.620 --> 01:20:01.300
Um, anyway, Genzu, the ninja who was called Shou in the Japanese version is a ninja, the

01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:08.140
successor to the Bushimiya Nippo, um, who actually that same style was used by guy in

01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:09.140
final fight.

01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:10.860
So there you go.

01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:16.780
Um, and then baby head, also known as Hoover, uh, Hoover.

01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:22.660
Basically baby commando is a genius infant who fights in a robot that he designed.

01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:32.420
Um, he has knee rockets, that's all you need to know, but he's a baby driving a mecha.

01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:35.380
So anyway, it is basically, it plays a lot like final fight.

01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:39.620
It is a beat them up, you have up to four players at the same time.

01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:44.620
You can choose any of the four commandos and you know, each person has a different one.

01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:49.100
So, um, the control configuration is just like final fight with an eight-way joystick.

01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:55.100
Um, you can move left or right or toward or away and the buttons for attacking ninja.

01:20:55.100 --> 01:21:00.420
Um, you also can pick up health restoring items, you can pick up, you can beat up destructible

01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:05.820
objects and you can get bonus items and weapons.

01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:13.460
So yeah, uh, the early, uh, captain commando looked like he honestly looked like he was

01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:14.460
from the seventies.

01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:20.300
He had like white flowing hair and gold chains around his neck and this disco looking outfit.

01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:28.460
And then later on in the eighties he looked like, you know, the eighties spaceman.

01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:32.220
Some fricking in-stream ad popped up and I didn't even notice it.

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:34.220
You need to put it on the ad blocker.

01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:38.220
They don't always work anymore.

01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:39.220
Anyway.

01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:46.740
But anyway, um, many of Capcom's early titles in the NES featured, um, captain commando

01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:54.340
on it between 1986 and 1989, um, 1942 commando, ghost and goblins, mega man, Trojan section

01:21:54.340 --> 01:22:00.940
Z and gun smoke, um, all released as part of the cap captain commando challenge series

01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:08.340
and had him on the back of the packaging in his futuristic space hero ray gun outfit with

01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:13.780
his medallion that said, you know, see on each of them, very disco.

01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:19.180
And then, um, the revised version of the one that looked, you know, more like a comic,

01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:25.500
you know, it was almost like a GI Joe character, but futuristic, um, was in the 1989 lineup,

01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:28.620
like strider, mega man, two willow and duck tales.

01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:32.900
Um, so that's the pilot suit fighter jet style.

01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:40.980
Um, and there was also a message on the artwork that said to the reader to look, look to him

01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:48.740
for up to date reports for all exciting action games from Capcom and including this feature.

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:54.740
So other releases of captain commando we had, um, on the super nest, it came out in 1995.

01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:59.300
It's only a two player one and shows fewer enemies, uh, on screen and doesn't have the

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:00.300
mech suit.

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:02.060
Um, it also is censored.

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:08.940
The PlayStation report came out in Japan on September 17th, 1998 by new ink.

01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:13.380
Has up to three players with a multiplayer, using a multiplayer adapter.

01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:19.980
Um, then we also had, uh, the CPS game, the full original version and Capcom classics

01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:25.820
collection remix for PSP and Capcom's Capcom classics collection volume two for PS2 and

01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:27.740
Xbox in 2006.

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:29.460
They were going to do a Sega CD version.

01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:31.620
It was announced, but never released.

01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:32.620
It was canceled.

01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:38.740
As for the captain himself, he was a playable character in Marvel versus Capcom.

01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:44.260
And um, that was in 1998 and he had a transformation sequence that had him going from a cowboy

01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:46.380
outfit before going to superhero.

01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:53.780
Um, he had his attacks from the game and his victory quotes are random Capcom trivia.

01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:59.500
Um, you know, as a tribute to his, you know, old stuff.

01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:06.180
Um, he was also in Marvel versus Capcom two, also in Capcom world two, Capcom cross, uh,

01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:12.180
sorry, NAMCO cross Capcom project X zone two and SNK versus Capcom card fighters flash.

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:18.180
He was also in the Udon comics, um, a two volume manga that came out that was, uh, I'm

01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:20.580
sorry, translated and published by Udon.

01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:27.300
Um, but also the other thing is that the other commandos did show up in, in, uh, Marvel versus

01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:29.780
Capcom for one of his hyper combo finishes.

01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:36.660
So, um, the super Famicom game got a 21 out of 40 for Famicom sutin.

01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:41.780
Um, the arcade game was listed as one of the top 21 beat em up games by heavy.com.

01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:43.540
And there you go, captain commando.

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:44.660
Awesome game.

01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:49.860
I used to go back as a, as a child because, you know, we used to go ride around on our

01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:54.740
bikes and then local, you know, town to go play the different arcade games that were

01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:55.060
everywhere.

01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:59.620
So they had, you know, of course the street fighter two at the seven 11, but there was

01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:05.940
a cafe that had captain commando and we'd go there and just play that all the way through

01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:06.820
when they get hamburger.

01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:08.260
I love that game.

01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:09.940
All right.

01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:10.340
There it is.

01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:11.380
Your classic game of the week.

01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:12.260
Captain commando.

01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:14.900
No, I never have.

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:15.540
Believe it or not.

01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:17.300
Weren't the mechs that were in this one.

01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:21.060
Those also in mega man X as well, because I remember they had like different elemental

01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:22.260
mechs similar, you know?

01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:26.580
And what's interesting too is that even though I never played that game, I remember the captain

01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:30.820
captain commando being like the capcom mascot for like a real hot minute in like some of

01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:34.740
the early NES manuals on, uh, you know, bring it back, do it.

01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:37.060
Hey, Inti create.

01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:40.900
If Nintendo says no to Zelda, how about a new captain commando?

01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:42.740
Captain commando for smash.

01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:45.620
I'd be down for that shit.

01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:47.380
He was in Marvel versus capcom too.

01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:48.820
And it was fucking awesome.

01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:50.580
You know, I always used to play as captain commando.

01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:54.100
You know, the latest big rumors, of course, there's always going to be rumors about smash

01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:54.500
characters.

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:58.340
So take it with a gigantic, take it with like the, all of the salt Luigi.

01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:01.300
They're going to add Waluigi because everyone's been bitching about Waluigi.

01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:04.180
No, uh, apparently two more that are going to be revealed soon.

01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:05.700
Isabel, which makes sense.

01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:07.060
I mean, that one makes total sense.

01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:12.100
Like Isabel is the subject of many interesting memes in Japan, uh, and in here too.

01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:13.780
So Isabel would make a lot of sense.

01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:17.060
Simon Belmont, the other one, I guess that they're talking about.

01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:21.220
So he was in that, um, that Nintendo 64 smash game.

01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:22.340
So yeah, who knows?

01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:22.740
Who knows?

01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:26.420
Any of these first appearance in a smash game too, that, uh, I don't remember what it's

01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:29.060
called, but they also had optimus prime in that game.

01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:29.860
And that was awesome.

01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:32.980
Was it dream something TV?

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:37.540
I don't remember the name of it, but I'm, I'm not going to hold my breath on any of

01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:39.140
these news or rumors in that too.

01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:41.460
Barbie for smash, Barbie for smash.

01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:42.180
Heck yeah.

01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:42.740
All right.

01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:46.260
Anyway, uh, we're gonna take a break while we contemplate all the characters we want

01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:47.060
to be in smash.

01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:49.140
When we come back, we have some rapid fire news.

01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:52.340
We're gonna talk about release dates, your emails and more stories.

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:53.460
So don't go anywhere, folks.

01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:54.740
We will be right back.

01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:04.580
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight.

01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:12.580
Episode number 739 of our show already in progress for tonight, July 29th of 2018.

01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:14.660
We have some more news to get into.

01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:17.940
We're going to get into rapid fire news here shortly, but a dark soccer, I believe you're

01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:19.300
going to be taken off, right?

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:19.780
Yeah.

01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:24.420
I, um, I actually spent most of yesterday with a headache at the event and then I came

01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:28.020
home with an even worse headache and it's been growing again today.

01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:33.460
So it's drive now and be safe to drive or sleep on your couch and not go to work tomorrow.

01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:37.780
So we can always stay on the couch if you need to, but I understand you want to, you

01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:38.820
got to go home so you can go to work.

01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:39.540
So, all right.

01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:40.740
Well, thank you as always for being here.

01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:41.940
Any final thoughts for our listeners?

01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:46.420
Um, um, strawberry rhubarb pie is delicious.

01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:47.620
It is pretty delicious.

01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:48.500
I feel better.

01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:48.900
Okay.

01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:50.820
Also, it's so weird looking at you right now.

01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:51.780
Why?

01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:54.660
With, with, without your, oh, without my beard.

01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:54.980
Yeah.

01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:58.660
It's been that way for like a month, but it's, it's, well, now that yesterday's very clean

01:27:58.660 --> 01:27:59.140
right now.

01:27:59.140 --> 01:27:59.220
Yeah.

01:27:59.220 --> 01:27:59.780
Well, yeah.

01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:00.820
Cause I had to, yeah.

01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:03.700
Cause I was kind of like, I would let it get a little scruffy and then be like, oh yeah,

01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:05.300
I got a little bit like you've waxed.

01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:07.860
No, I didn't, I didn't go that far.

01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:10.820
Um, so yesterday, and there's some Queens who wax.

01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:13.380
If you guys didn't know, I think I made this pretty clear.

01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:14.900
I did the production of clue.

01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:19.700
I played Mrs. Peacock and it all kind of ties into, if you know the movie in the, one of

01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:21.700
the endings, they go just like the Mounties.

01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:22.900
We always get our man.

01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:26.260
Mrs. Peacock was a man slap, you know, that thing.

01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:27.380
So that was the joke.

01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:27.860
Right.

01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:31.540
Uh, and I, I'd seen like a drag performance of his peacock like 10 years ago.

01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:33.140
And I always thought it was like the funniest thing I ever saw.

01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:36.100
So I was like, okay, I want to do it for this show, but I fully committed.

01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:37.460
So, you know, I shaved my face.

01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:38.340
So the red beard's gone.

01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:42.420
So I just shaved yesterday morning was probably when I last shaved.

01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:44.180
But then I don't know if you also notice, look at this.

01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:48.500
I shaved my legs because I tried to do the stocking trick, but it didn't work.

01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:52.980
So, um, and the stocking trick is that you wear multiple pairs of stockings, but just

01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:53.620
wasn't happening.

01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:57.860
But you'll notice I only shaved them up to here where the dress came down to.

01:28:57.860 --> 01:28:59.860
I don't, you got to admit shaved legs.

01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:00.980
Do you feel pretty nice?

01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:01.860
No, I hate it.

01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:02.260
Really?

01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:05.140
Really?

01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:05.540
I don't know.

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:06.420
I don't know.

01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:10.260
I've never liked like stubble on my arms or my legs.

01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:11.380
I shaved my arms too.

01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:12.020
Yeah.

01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:13.940
And I don't like the way the wind feels.

01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:18.100
I did that as well, but I cheated a little bit because it didn't really grow all back

01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:19.140
when I did it two weeks ago.

01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:20.260
So I kind of kept that.

01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:21.860
And it's the same thing with my chest.

01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:25.060
Like I shaved it two weeks ago and it didn't grow back enough.

01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:27.460
So I kind of didn't redo it yesterday.

01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:32.340
So, but I mean, it's just, it's just a sensitivity thing for me.

01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:37.860
But if I'm gonna like not wear jeans, then I like for to not have hair to get caught

01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:38.900
in wind or anything.

01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:39.460
Yeah, no.

01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:41.780
And that's the weird thing now is wearing jeans.

01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:47.300
It's like I feel weird in this area where I see I like how that feels because it's like

01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:47.940
clean.

01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:53.460
But let the record show I am fully committed to my art because, you know, drag is not something

01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:54.260
I usually do.

01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:54.660
Okay.

01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:55.140
I know.

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:59.540
I know if there's a lot of stereotypes out there that that's what all gay guys do for

01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:00.420
fun on Friday nights.

01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:01.300
That's so not true.

01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:02.420
Just being clear.

01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:05.620
But I did it for a performance for the laughs.

01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:08.340
And, you know, it seemed to go over really well.

01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:12.900
I got a lot of really positive feedback last night and just some really like nice, nice

01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:13.060
things.

01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:16.340
I was very impressed with your royal leg slant.

01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:17.460
Oh.

01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:18.260
The picture on the couch.

01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:18.580
Oh yeah.

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:19.540
When I was sitting on the couch.

01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:21.300
Well, because my heels were, I don't know.

01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:24.580
But yes, I did the Rolex because she's not crossing her legs in the movie.

01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:24.820
Right.

01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:25.860
I remember when you shadow cast.

01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:30.260
But at the same time, I didn't want to show because I wasn't wearing much under that.

01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:31.220
Yeah.

01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:31.620
Dress.

01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:36.900
And I did not go that fully committed to my drag art.

01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:37.780
We'll leave it at that.

01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:40.660
For that era though, the movie was supposed to represent.

01:30:40.660 --> 01:30:46.100
However, it was considered a more wanton thing for a woman to cross her legs.

01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:46.420
Yeah.

01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:47.860
So that actually was period.

01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:48.500
Correct.

01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:49.140
So, okay.

01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:49.540
So yeah.

01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:50.260
So I did.

01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:55.060
So yeah, I did the whole like slanting instead so that you couldn't see up my dress perverts.

01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:56.260
You were like Princess Kate.

01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:59.380
Well, especially, especially when you're on that stage elevated.

01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:01.620
So like your crotch is at eye level for everybody.

01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:03.940
Like I had to be very like thinking about that.

01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:08.980
And I felt, I felt kind of bad, bad for Yvette because Yvette dies on that billiard table.

01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:11.940
And it's like, you can see London and France.

01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:13.540
Now she was prepared for it.

01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:15.380
So she had enough.

01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:17.620
You weren't going to see nothing, but it was still, I was like.

01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:20.740
She should have either had frilly, frilly pantalant, you know.

01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:21.140
She did.

01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:24.580
Or really colorful underwear.

01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:27.140
No, she had, I told her to draw teeth on it, but.

01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:27.640
Yeah.

01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:29.700
She didn't.

01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:30.820
Anyway.

01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:31.140
All right.

01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:34.500
I'm going to go before the drugs wear off.

01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:35.140
Okay, good.

01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:35.300
Yeah.

01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:39.060
The chat is going bonds, double six says, OLR body hair episode.

01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:40.740
Hey, you know what?

01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:44.260
Every, everybody's, it's, it's the human body.

01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:46.820
There are people who have trouble though, growing hair.

01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:47.460
Sure.

01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:48.740
And I'm not one of those people.

01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:54.980
Well, I, I've, I had an ex who did not grow and, you know, I don't want to get into stereotypes,

01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:59.380
but it is just, uh, guys that are a hundred percent Asian.

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:00.820
I've known some hairy Asian guys though.

01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:01.540
Yeah, that is true.

01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:01.940
That's true.

01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:06.020
But a lot of guys that are like a hundred percent Asian don't always grow it like as much.

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:07.380
So, you know, it just depends.

01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:08.420
My friend had alopecia.

01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:09.700
Oh yeah.

01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:11.620
Well, I knew a friend who had trichotillomania.

01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:13.060
Well, I'm like, you know, that is right.

01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:14.660
A lot of dudes have alopecia on their heads.

01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:16.180
Where you pull your own hair.

01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:19.540
Oh no, no, I've heard of that.

01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:21.540
No, that's just called having children.

01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:27.460
No, like they'll pick out their arm hair or their eyebrow or their, um, eyelashes and

01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:29.540
they'll just, it's a nervous thing.

01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:33.380
I only do that to fight off my eyelashes because they're trying to attack my eyes.

01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:34.340
Same with my eyebrows.

01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:35.460
Well, you know, how about this?

01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:38.100
Uh, O-O-L-R, love your body no matter what.

01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:38.980
That's, that's what it is.

01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:40.020
Even with your manias.

01:32:40.020 --> 01:32:42.740
Uh, Bond's 006 says, O-L-R, so you're a teenager.

01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:45.140
All right, we need to move on.

01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:48.660
See, you'll start this field differently about the opposite sex and then.

01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:49.700
Or maybe not.

01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:53.220
Or you won't feel differently at all.

01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:54.180
You'll still be ace.

01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:57.940
You'll feel awkward.

01:32:57.940 --> 01:32:59.060
Very awkward.

01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:01.860
No matter what, you're going to feel awkward.

01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:07.940
And your skin at the time where you want to look your best, your skin will look its worst.

01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:12.900
You will have a topographical map of the Himalayas on your face.

01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:17.060
And I know that people like to tell you that it gets better when it comes to things like

01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:19.140
that and for the most part, life does get better.

01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:22.100
When it comes to your skin, it's never going to get better.

01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:24.740
So that's why drugs exist.

01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:25.800
All right.

01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:28.180
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:32.100
Thank you to our soccer for getting us on a 10-minute tangent about non-gaming related things.

01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:36.100
But let's get back into gaming and get into some rapid fire news.

01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:36.600
Loki.

01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:39.060
Yes, so this is pretty cool.

01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:41.380
And I've actually kind of looked at this game myself and bought it.

01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:46.100
So I bad on me, but, um, it's a really neat indie game.

01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:50.580
I know it was one that I was kind of interested in because it was a unity made game.

01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:55.300
But the hat and a hat in time, which has been out on several different platforms,

01:33:55.300 --> 01:34:00.740
that PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One has finally sold 500,000 copies, which is great.

01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:05.780
And it for those not familiar with the game, it's kind of like a 3D platform or akin to

01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:07.860
like a Mario 64 or something like that.

01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:11.380
But it's cute and definitely worth checking out.

01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:12.580
I wish it was on the Switch.

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:13.700
I would totally pick it up on the Switch.

01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:16.100
I guess I'll have to play it on the PlayStation 4.

01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:18.900
Yeah, I don't really know this game, so I'll have to check it out.

01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:20.020
Yeah, it looks really cool.

01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:21.220
So definitely check that out.

01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:28.660
The other one is Freeze Me, which is not this game, but it's similar to Mario 64.

01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:33.780
Anyways, and then, of course, as always, each month we have our free games.

01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:35.140
I'm not sure what PlayStation is.

01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:37.140
I checked and they didn't have the listing for it yet.

01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:40.740
But for the Microsoft side of things in August,

01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:46.980
we're going to be getting Forza Horizon 2 Standard 10th Anniversary Edition is going

01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:49.860
to be free August 1st, the 31st.

01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:55.860
And For Honor is going to be available from August 16th through September 15th.

01:34:56.580 --> 01:35:03.380
And then on the Xbox 360 compatible games, we have Dead Space 3 and Disney's Epic Mickey 2.

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:05.300
So interesting.

01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:06.100
That's pretty awesome.

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:10.260
So Dead Space, first half of the month and Epic Mickey 2, second half of the month.

01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:12.580
To this day, I still hate the name Epic Mickey.

01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:14.120
Yeah.

01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:15.700
But that's all right.

01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:18.820
The game is supposed to be pretty decent, but I don't know.

01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:21.140
Yeah, I think the second game a lot of people kind of passed on,

01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:23.300
but I heard it was better than the first.

01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:27.060
I like the idea of like this twisted Magic Kingdom stuff.

01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:29.540
I wish they went more with that, but then, you know.

01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:31.860
Well, now many people have a chance to visit it.

01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:33.860
Act F says the second game was OK-ish.

01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:35.700
Well, maybe it's free.

01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:36.420
That's right.

01:35:36.420 --> 01:35:37.780
That's not an OK-ish price.

01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:39.060
Free with your subscription.

01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:39.380
Yeah.

01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:40.340
Yeah. All right.

01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:43.460
Anyway, I have a couple of stories with audio to go with it,

01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:45.620
including a story about WarioWare Gold.

01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:50.900
Apparently, I thought that WarioWare Gold was supposed to be like just a mix of like greatest

01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:53.620
hits, but apparently there's like newer stuff that showed up in it too.

01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:55.540
Some of the mini games have been redone.

01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:56.740
And then there's this.

01:35:56.740 --> 01:36:02.260
There is a mini game in it called Mutroid 2, Return of Sam-Meow.

01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:04.340
So that's right.

01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:09.220
It is a Metroid-ish type of game full of cats.

01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:09.940
Oh, I don't know.

01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:13.060
It's not really Metroid, but the music is sure Metroid.

01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:22.020
And you're this little cat with a gun and you're shooting all these little turtles

01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:24.340
as they're trying to get up to you.

01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:29.860
Anyway, I love it.

01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:30.180
I know.

01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:30.900
I love it too.

01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:33.540
Like I was like, well, I'm not going to buy this WarioWare game on 3DS.

01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:34.900
It's just a mix of all the old stuff.

01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:36.500
And now I'm like, God damn it.

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:37.140
God damn it.

01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:41.940
They're really going to get me to do that when I thought I was out and pulling right back in.

01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:42.260
All right.

01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:49.060
Anyway, so speaking of audio related things, the Smash Brothers Ultimate page has been

01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:52.100
revealing some of the new music that's going to be in the game.

01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:53.060
Get this.

01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:56.100
There is a new F-Zero arrangement in the game.

01:36:56.740 --> 01:36:59.060
So that's awesome, but it gets better.

01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:05.620
Uh, Takunobu Mitsuyoshi is the musician behind this.

01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:06.900
Have you ever heard that name before?

01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:08.660
I'll give you a hint.

01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:10.020
He sang a song and it went like this.

01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:17.060
So the Daytona guy is doing an F-Zero song.

01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:18.420
Are you fucking ready to hear this?

01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:20.260
I don't know if I am ever ready to hear this.

01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:21.220
You cannot handle this.

01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:28.740
Okay.

01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:31.060
And then he, when he gets in the seat, let me, let me move forward a little bit.

01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:32.820
He sings a little more in the second half of this clip.

01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:37.300
Come on.

01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:38.020
Get some more singing.

01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:42.580
Ah, this is such a good clip though.

01:37:42.580 --> 01:37:54.340
I'm okay with this.

01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:57.940
It's like things I didn't know I needed until I had them.

01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:00.420
I love it.

01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:03.780
Anyway, so please, please more stuff like that.

01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:08.900
Like, you know, and one thing I think we tend to forget about the Smash Brothers game games,

01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:11.060
they never slack in the music department.

01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:12.660
They never slack in the music department.

01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:16.740
Can we get a new F-Zero game and then have the Daytona car as a special unlock?

01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:17.700
That'd be amazing.

01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:18.980
Oh my God.

01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:22.020
Act Def says I want an F-Zero with this music.

01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:24.020
I want any type of F-Zero.

01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:24.740
And Act Def goes,

01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:30.740
Do you think if they're making arrangements of music that perhaps they are working on something?

01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:32.580
Or do they just do this for Smash?

01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:36.020
I feel like this is a Smash thing because the Smash thing is usually where you get like these

01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:38.340
big legendary artists to do like songs.

01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:39.140
But I don't know.

01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:39.540
We'll see.

01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:41.300
Well, since you're here.

01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:41.700
Yeah.

01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:42.180
Right.

01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:42.980
You can hope.

01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:43.460
You can hope.

01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:44.980
Or as Fifth Dream in chat says,

01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:47.380
Perhaps.

01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:48.980
Since we just had a story about cats.

01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:49.220
All right.

01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:49.540
Forget it.

01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:51.460
That should be a full fledged game right there.

01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:53.220
What else do we have, Loki?

01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:54.020
All right.

01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:59.620
So remember that whole adaptive Xbox controller for, you know, accessibility and stuff like that?

01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:03.140
So, of course, they went the extra mile of not only thinking about the

01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:07.060
accessibility of the controller, but the accessibility of the packaging.

01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:14.260
So they actually addressed the need of, you know, people that might be disabled

01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:15.460
with the packaging as well.

01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:20.580
So they would be able to open the cardboard box with limited mobility and that type of thing.

01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:21.540
So that's pretty awesome.

01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:26.180
So they had this loop that you would be able to pull that would kind of help with

01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:31.860
opening the packaging on the box and stuff and to get the controller out of the box.

01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:34.660
You had another loop to pull and everything.

01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:36.180
So that is pretty neat.

01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:39.220
That they went that far as to think about packaging.

01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:39.700
Yeah.

01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:44.660
Like, I don't have challenges when it comes to opening packaging.

01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:47.620
And, you know, even though sometimes the stuff that, you know,

01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:50.580
Unless it's in those fucking clam shells or yeah.

01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:53.780
But anyway, all that aside, like, I was looking at the unboxing of this.

01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:54.980
I'm like, that looks like fun.

01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:57.380
That looks like to open that looks like kind of like fun.

01:39:57.380 --> 01:39:59.540
You know, it's very, very different.

01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:00.900
So that's really cool.

01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:02.820
That's cool for everyone.

01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:07.700
But especially the fact that, you know, it helps differently abled folks is really cool.

01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:08.340
So, yeah.

01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:08.840
Neat.

01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:14.580
And the other thing, of course, is Homestar Runner is going to be getting its own board

01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:17.220
game thanks to a Kickstarter program.

01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:20.500
So they have, yeah, Homestar Runners.

01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:26.020
And it's an area control game which will allow up to two to six players work together to

01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:32.580
help a beefy armed dragon completely decimate a kingdom by using unique powers and items.

01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:33.080
Awesome.

01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:35.460
So it's pretty awesome looking.

01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:40.980
Apparently, they had a seventy five thousand dollar goal.

01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:43.540
They blew through that immediately.

01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:49.380
And right now, with three weeks left, they are over seven hundred fifty thousand dollars

01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:52.020
and onto stretch goals.

01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:54.500
So I had a feeling that would get funded pretty quick.

01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:56.580
So I'm glad that that turned out well.

01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:58.100
Let's hope that it actually gets released.

01:40:58.100 --> 01:41:00.260
Yeah, they're eight hundred forty four thousand right now.

01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:05.860
Let's just hope that everything goes well, because, you know, Kickstarter can be a little

01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:06.980
bit shady sometimes.

01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:11.140
Dr. C wants to remind you in our chair room that he does have a name.

01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:13.140
The name is Traktor.

01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:15.000
Right.

01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:17.300
I think Loki just didn't want to say it.

01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:17.800
All right.

01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:21.620
Anyhow, we're going to get to some release dates here in just a moment.

01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:24.740
Looking at some other comments in chat over at live.vodka.org.com.

01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:26.740
Act Def says, yeah, they do this for Smash.

01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:28.900
They did a ton of arrangements for Brawl.

01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:30.500
Like this.

01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:32.100
So, yeah, I wouldn't get your hopes up.

01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:38.020
Loki, there's a whole new game coming for F-Zero, although I really, really wish it

01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:38.660
would be.

01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:42.260
But anyhow, what games are coming out that I will get to play Loki in the US?

01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:49.300
So in the US, we're going to get to play a game called Chasm, which is or I guess Chasm,

01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:53.220
which would be on PC, PlayStation 4 and the Vita.

01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:56.980
We have Code of Princess EX on the Nintendo Switch.

01:41:57.700 --> 01:42:00.660
Titan Quest on the Nintendo Switch.

01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:02.660
Yakuza 0 on PC.

01:42:03.380 --> 01:42:07.300
This is the police on PC, Mac and Linux.

01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:07.780
Is it now?

01:42:07.780 --> 01:42:08.180
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:09.300
This is the police 2.

01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:11.060
It's the sequel.

01:42:11.060 --> 01:42:13.300
I didn't know there was a this is the police war was.

01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:14.580
Yes, I remember it.

01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:17.860
And then finally, WarioWare Gold on the 3DS.

01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:18.980
So you can play Mutroid.

01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:21.220
Yes, that's really the only reason.

01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:22.500
Well, that is WarioWare.

01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:23.060
It's amazing.

01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:26.740
Why it's not on the Switch for no reason whatsoever.

01:42:27.380 --> 01:42:27.860
I don't know.

01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:28.980
All right.

01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:31.700
Well, heading over to Japan and then maybe you could fill in with the UK dates.

01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:36.260
And so Jimmy, I believe going over to Japan, checking out the releases there on the PlayStation

01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:41.220
4 on August 2nd, Friday the 13th, the game gets released in Japan, which seems a bummer.

01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:44.180
It's probably a little late over there in Japan because the game is not really going

01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:45.460
to be getting supported anymore.

01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:49.140
I guess they ran into some issues with the movie and stuff, which which kind of sucks

01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:52.420
because the game was like like everybody was fucking playing that when it was first out.

01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:53.140
It was a lot of fun.

01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:55.780
And then it just it kind of died off like real quick.

01:42:55.780 --> 01:43:00.420
So it's I'm kind of bummed that that game had such inertia behind it and they kind of

01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:01.380
dropped the ball.

01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:04.580
And I think a lot of it has to I don't I don't necessarily think it's the developer's fault.

01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:08.180
I think it just has to spin off with more horror.

01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:13.060
I know they should make just they should just make their own horror thing game that just

01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:15.380
doesn't even use the Friday the 13th characters.

01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:20.580
And if they just put by the makers of Friday the 13th game, people will people will check

01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:22.580
out like make new characters.

01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:26.420
And you can even have different characters that people could play as it would be different

01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:27.620
abilities or multiple.

01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:33.140
I don't think like any of the campers are based off of real people, except for the one

01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:35.860
that you revive, one of the players to bring back like that.

01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:36.900
I can't remember who that was.

01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:38.740
It's from like Friday, 13th, part three or something.

01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:42.260
There's there's like I don't think the kids are.

01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:44.740
Yeah, they're generic.

01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:46.020
All right.

01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:47.780
Anyway, let's see.

01:43:47.780 --> 01:43:50.900
Going to other comments or sorry, not other comments, but other games that are releasing

01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:52.100
on the PlayStation for Japan.

01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:58.740
Saga Scarlet Grace is out on August 2nd in Japan, as well as a game called Border Break

01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:00.660
is out from Sega in Japan.

01:44:00.660 --> 01:44:05.220
There's also a bunch of PS4 with the Border Break in them.

01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:10.020
So I guess Border Break is a big enough game to be getting different PlayStations with

01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:10.520
it.

01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:16.020
I'm not super familiar with the series, but it's by Sega and it's 10 versus 10 high speed

01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:17.940
robot battles is what this game is.

01:44:17.940 --> 01:44:19.220
This is more up your alley, Loki.

01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:20.900
It looks cool.

01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:23.220
I don't know what it is.

01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:24.980
Yeah, I want to know what it is.

01:44:24.980 --> 01:44:26.420
You may have to look.

01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:27.940
Yeah, it looks pretty bad ass.

01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:31.300
I mean, you know, screenshots look pretty sweet.

01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:34.340
And if you have yet to jump on Monster Hunter World, good news.

01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:37.380
It's moving into like the best hits already.

01:44:37.380 --> 01:44:38.660
It seems really fast.

01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:40.500
But that means a price reduction over there in Japan.

01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:46.820
It looks like either like a virtual on or like armored core almost.

01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:48.580
I'm not down.

01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:49.940
Man, is this coming over here?

01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:51.060
I don't know.

01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:55.540
Going to the switch, that saga Scarlet Grace is also out on the switch.

01:44:55.540 --> 01:45:01.300
Otherwise, you also have pro Yaku Famista Evolution and Lego The Incredibles gets its

01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:02.260
release over there.

01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:06.340
There's also some different accessories with Mario's face and stuff on them.

01:45:06.340 --> 01:45:08.660
If that is your sort of it was an arcade game.

01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:10.580
That's why I recognize it.

01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:11.080
Got it.

01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:12.340
Okay.

01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:13.940
How about the UK, Loki?

01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:14.260
All right.

01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:15.700
UK is not getting a whole ton of stuff.

01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:20.580
They're getting Titan Quest as well on the switch and Hello Neighbor on the switch and

01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:22.580
on PlayStation four.

01:45:22.580 --> 01:45:23.780
And that's unfortunately it.

01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:26.100
All right.

01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:30.900
Well, let's go to the mailbag because every week you guys send us emails and we read some

01:45:30.900 --> 01:45:32.100
of our favorites here on the show.

01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:35.860
If you want to email us, I encourage you to do so.

01:45:35.860 --> 01:45:40.180
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:45:40.180 --> 01:45:42.660
And we do have one email in the mailbag tonight.

01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:44.020
It's nice to hear from some folks.

01:45:44.020 --> 01:45:46.020
One email in the mailbag tonight.

01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:50.980
And tonight's email comes to us courtesy of Frodo Swagons, who emails us the following.

01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:54.740
Rob, I was watching your stream this week of No Man's Sky.

01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:55.140
Thank you.

01:45:55.140 --> 01:45:56.660
I recognize the name from the stream.

01:45:56.660 --> 01:45:57.460
Thank you.

01:45:57.460 --> 01:46:01.460
I know you'll probably mention it in your gaming week, but I was curious to know what

01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:02.900
you think of the update.

01:46:03.460 --> 01:46:06.420
Um, I, is it something you will continue to play?

01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:08.580
Also, I was wondering about the multiplayer.

01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:12.260
I know you can have up to four people in your game, but I can't understand what the point

01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:16.820
is in naming a creature that you discover or making your base discoverable for other

01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:18.980
players when it seems to be invite only.

01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:22.900
How would anyone stumble across something of yours if it's not some type of mega server?

01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:24.660
I guess I'm a bit confused there.

01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:26.420
Weekly listener is a big mega server.

01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:27.300
Frodo Swagons.

01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:27.620
Yeah.

01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:32.100
And Frodo, I think I think that might be the misunderstanding there is that it is a mega

01:46:32.100 --> 01:46:32.500
server.

01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:38.420
You are connecting to, um, problem is it's such a vast universe that you probably won't

01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:39.060
run across.

01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:45.220
Um, the person that you're like, if I was trying to find Rob, you know, without actually

01:46:45.220 --> 01:46:48.660
joining his game or something like that, it would probably be very impossible for me to

01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:49.380
run across.

01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:53.540
There's ways to do it because Dungeon Buster got to us in his main game and I don't know

01:46:53.540 --> 01:46:54.340
how he did it.

01:46:54.340 --> 01:46:58.260
Like if I was just casually playing the game, I wouldn't probably run across stuff.

01:46:58.260 --> 01:46:58.740
No, no.

01:46:59.220 --> 01:47:03.460
Well, and I think that was the whole reason why the developers kind of thought maybe they

01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:06.180
didn't need multiplayer in the beginning is they're like, the universe is too huge.

01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:08.740
You're never going to run into other people because there's too many places to be.

01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:13.460
But I do know when I did play the first version of the game, it took me a little while.

01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:18.820
Um, but I transported like, you know, I went like 10 jumps, 10 different galaxies in and

01:47:18.820 --> 01:47:21.860
I got to a galaxy that somebody else had named.

01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:25.060
So I saw there and I think they kept the default name or whatever.

01:47:25.060 --> 01:47:27.220
Like a lot of people just keep the default names.

01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:31.300
But I saw this guy's name and it said it was credited.

01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:36.260
It was discovered by and then whoever the gamer tag was on PlayStation four.

01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:43.620
Um, so in the case of like Planet Blissey that I named, if some rando comes across that

01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:45.940
universe, they're going to see Planet Blissey.

01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:48.020
Uh, and so they'll be like, Blissey, what is this?

01:47:48.020 --> 01:47:48.580
So they'll know.

01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:50.740
Well, they'll see my name that I'm the one that discovered it.

01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:52.020
So they'll land in there.

01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:55.940
And then of course the universe Bobby Black Wolf named is a Voglandia.

01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:57.460
I think that was a Voglandia.

01:47:57.460 --> 01:48:01.140
So, um, you know, people are going to see right away that people have been here before

01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:04.180
and that's going to be, um, your first hint.

01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:09.700
Now in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says it's from when you start

01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:14.340
the game, you can choose to start your own game or join a friends if they are online.

01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:17.220
So, but, but aren't you starting a new game when you do that Dungeon Buster?

01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:20.180
Or can you take like your old data and move to the new one?

01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:20.660
I don't know.

01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:26.020
But when you do play online, um, you can, yeah, you, you will basically start in the

01:48:26.020 --> 01:48:28.980
universe that your friends started in.

01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:31.060
And that's what we kind of learned was happening.

01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:35.300
Like by the time I went to Planet Blissey, which was a different planet in the system,

01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:39.700
more people were joining the game like, uh, Bobby Black Wolf, like my friend Neil.

01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:44.340
And they started in the exact same place I did on the starting planet.

01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:48.260
And they figured it out because I had named one of the creatures Kitty.

01:48:48.260 --> 01:48:50.900
Because it was this adorable little thing that was walking around.

01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:53.380
I just got kitty because that's Alan does that.

01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:56.100
Sometimes whenever he sees like a thing, he'll go kitty.

01:48:56.100 --> 01:49:00.820
Um, so I named it kitty and Bobby, when he started his game, he's like, oh, I am where

01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:03.460
you started because there's a lot of the resources aren't here.

01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:04.500
And I just found kitty.

01:49:05.140 --> 01:49:08.420
So, uh, it's kind of interesting how that worked.

01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:09.380
So, uh, okay.

01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:13.940
Dungeon Buster says I saved my game and went back to choose friends lobby and zoom.

01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:15.140
I made it to Blissey.

01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:15.780
Interesting.

01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:16.420
Okay.

01:49:16.420 --> 01:49:17.780
So there's ways to do it.

01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:22.980
Um, the one thing I did think was interesting about the online though, and something I wish

01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:23.540
they'd change.

01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:31.060
When you do play online, meaning the multiplayer stuff, I believe the naming is always going

01:49:31.060 --> 01:49:31.540
to be there.

01:49:31.540 --> 01:49:36.340
But if you want people to be able to find you and all that stuff, uh, you can, uh, opt

01:49:36.340 --> 01:49:37.380
to play online.

01:49:37.380 --> 01:49:40.740
But when you do that, anyone can join your game.

01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:41.220
Anyone.

01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:46.980
There is no setting for friends only like most games have.

01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:51.220
That would be my one feedback for hello games that I think is a really obvious thing that

01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:55.700
they left out is I would really like to have a mode where friends only can come into my

01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:58.580
solar system because I was playing the game.

01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:04.100
And I think in the very first stream I did, I was playing the game and some Rando joined.

01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:07.860
And at this point I already left the home planet and I really had no interest in going

01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:09.540
back to go meet some Rando.

01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:11.300
So I was just like, whatever, dude, you're on your own.

01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:16.820
I'm curious if that Rando stayed with it or what they did, because it would be very

01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:21.540
interesting to see if maybe he didn't figure out that Blissey was a great planet.

01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:24.100
Maybe he tried to establish a presence somewhere else.

01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:27.140
Or if when I left the game, he was like, fuck that guy and just left.

01:50:27.140 --> 01:50:27.620
I don't know.

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:28.500
Who knows?

01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:34.580
So anyway, um, dungeon buster continues, uh, getting back to my universe.

01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:36.020
That was kind of messy after you left.

01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:40.580
I tried using the gate from the space station in your system and ended up in empty space

01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:41.940
killed by cosmic rays.

01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:42.500
Wow.

01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:43.700
I kept all my stuff.

01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:46.180
It was just as if I jumped to a new system.

01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:48.340
Only you and Black Wolf were there.

01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:48.980
Interesting.

01:50:50.260 --> 01:50:51.620
I kind of think that's interesting.

01:50:51.620 --> 01:50:54.900
So you can kind of take your data and move it to other games wherever you want.

01:50:54.900 --> 01:50:55.940
Well, that's kind of neat.

01:50:55.940 --> 01:51:00.020
So, uh, I do know also they have that galactic map online.

01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:05.780
So theoretically, if I could figure out how to give you the coordinates of Voglandia,

01:51:05.780 --> 01:51:10.020
then you could look it up on this galactic map and you'd be able to see everything we're

01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:10.420
doing there.

01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:12.980
I don't, I don't know what all the galactic map tells you.

01:51:12.980 --> 01:51:14.660
I guess we're still trying to figure some of that out.

01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:16.340
So we'll see.

01:51:16.900 --> 01:51:22.180
Uh, dungeon buster in chat says you can only invite friends, but so far you can't restrict

01:51:22.180 --> 01:51:23.940
it to only friends.

01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:29.140
So, uh, Kaijuto says, sorry, the universe is for all friends only is too secluded for

01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:29.620
my taste.

01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:32.180
You're changing it though, Kaijuto.

01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:37.540
The universe is still open to all everything you name and all that stuff still changes

01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:38.420
it with all.

01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:42.580
The thing is, is that if you don't want to necessarily adventure with other people, then,

01:51:42.580 --> 01:51:46.660
you know, I think you should be able to turn it off because the resources you gather, the

01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:49.060
stuff you do, that does impact the planet.

01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:52.580
So I could see how like people might lightly troll, but I don't think you'd really troll

01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:54.580
anybody that bad in the game.

01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:58.340
But I just, you know, with voice chat and everything, I don't need somebody joining

01:51:58.340 --> 01:52:01.060
my game going, you know, F F F F.

01:52:01.060 --> 01:52:05.220
Well, have we gotten like, can't you buy like big freighters and stuff like that in this

01:52:05.220 --> 01:52:06.100
game now?

01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:07.700
I haven't gotten that far yet.

01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:08.580
Cause that'd be cool.

01:52:08.580 --> 01:52:12.340
I don't even have my fucking like warp drive to go to another universe built yet, but I'm

01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:13.940
not in a hurry to leave my current universe.

01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:14.900
You know what I mean?

01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:16.740
That's kind of go back and play.

01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:19.540
You should, if you bought the game, check it out with the update.

01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:20.580
You don't have to pay for it.

01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:22.660
So then you downloaded it again.

01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:24.660
I know I downloaded it again when I got my new system.

01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:26.420
It's a nine gig update though.

01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:27.380
Be careful.

01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:28.420
It's going to take you a time.

01:52:29.060 --> 01:52:29.460
All right.

01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:30.820
Oh, well, my games already update.

01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:33.540
They update, um, cause I keep everything in sleep mode.

01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:34.740
So it updates automatically.

01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:35.140
Oh, good.

01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:38.420
So when I go in there, uh, Bobby does point out if you're joining, if they're joining

01:52:38.420 --> 01:52:39.860
your game, you can mute and kick them.

01:52:39.860 --> 01:52:41.060
Oh, that's good to know about trolls.

01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:45.220
Uh, watch out though, a PlayStation four, if you haven't played it in a while, PS4 won't

01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:46.100
keep updating it.

01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:49.700
So if you haven't launched it in like over two months, PS4 is not going to update it

01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:50.340
automatically.

01:52:50.340 --> 01:52:51.780
Well, I just downloaded it again.

01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:55.140
So I would think it would try to then, then you should be fine.

01:52:55.140 --> 01:52:57.940
I mean, it wasn't like this week that I downloaded.

01:52:57.940 --> 01:52:59.940
I downloaded it a couple of weeks ago.

01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:00.820
Uh, you should be fine.

01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:02.340
I think it was in the last 30 or 60 days.

01:53:02.340 --> 01:53:02.900
Should be fine.

01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:03.620
All right.

01:53:03.620 --> 01:53:06.260
Anyway, uh, do that was it for the mailbag.

01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:07.380
Thank you very much for the email.

01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:07.940
Appreciate that.

01:53:08.020 --> 01:53:12.180
And again, if you guys want to email us in a future week, participate at orange lounge

01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:14.340
radio.com is the place to send those emails.

01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:16.980
In the meantime, we have a few more stories for you guys that we're going to open up the

01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:21.140
Skype line at orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype, but first Loki.

01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:28.500
So apparently a hacker that was, um, he was arrested for cracking de Novo's anti pirate,

01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:30.900
um, piracy software.

01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:42.660
So apparently there, this guy in Bulgaria named, um, boxy, he broke through, I guess

01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:48.740
the, their cracking, um, software and was able to crack de Novo.

01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:51.780
And so with that, I guess I got him a little bit of attention.

01:53:51.780 --> 01:53:58.340
And so he has been arrested and basically said it finally happened.

01:53:58.340 --> 01:54:00.180
I can't say it wasn't expected.

01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:05.620
Police came yesterday and took the server PC and my personal PC.

01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:08.660
I had to go to the police afterwards and explain myself.

01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:09.160
Wow.

01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:18.020
Apparently they said, you know, that the parent company of de Novo, um, or or dito.

01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:24.420
And I guess the Bulgarian cyber crime units, uh, were, had an investigation into him and

01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:29.140
says, uh, the swift action of the Bulgarian police on this matter shows that the power

01:54:29.140 --> 01:54:33.460
of collaboration between law enforcement and technology providers and that piracy is

01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:36.180
a serious offense that will be acted upon.

01:54:37.700 --> 01:54:42.580
Well, I mean, congratulations.

01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:46.580
You caught somebody, but I, it's not going to stop hackers going to hack.

01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:47.300
It doesn't matter.

01:54:47.300 --> 01:54:51.540
Yeah, it's still, and especially if this is not popular, which I pretty sure de Novo is

01:54:51.540 --> 01:54:53.060
not very popular from what I've heard.

01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:54.820
Uh, it's probably not going to stop it.

01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:57.220
I'm not, I'm not defending piracy.

01:54:57.220 --> 01:55:01.060
Like again, you know, like if you like something, you should pay money for it.

01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:06.820
And anti-piracy methods like this do suck when it affects the performance of the game.

01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:07.140
Right.

01:55:07.140 --> 01:55:10.980
When the anti-piracy gets too fucking out of hand though, I understand why people want

01:55:10.980 --> 01:55:12.340
to be able to just disable it.

01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:12.900
You know what I mean?

01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:16.900
I miss the days of just having to look something up in page four of the manual.

01:55:17.860 --> 01:55:19.380
Give me the code on page four.

01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:20.500
All right.

01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:22.100
We all know why that doesn't really work though.

01:55:22.980 --> 01:55:23.540
All right.

01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:25.140
Because you could photocopy that stuff?

01:55:25.140 --> 01:55:26.500
Uh, some of them you couldn't.

01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:30.500
I remember when they started printing them on like that red paper that you can't photocopy,

01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:32.420
but now they just need PDF it.

01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:33.940
Now you can scan it.

01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:35.460
There's so much stuff you can do anyway.

01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:37.300
Uh, moving on.

01:55:37.300 --> 01:55:40.980
I know we don't usually talk about sports games on the show, but I think this one was

01:55:40.980 --> 01:55:44.660
worth noting because this is, it's one of those things where you go, wow, they're finally

01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:45.940
doing this in 2018.

01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:48.260
It seems like this should have been something that happened a lot sooner.

01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:54.100
But, uh, the newest, uh, EA basketball game that's on its way out, NBA live at 19, EA

01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:58.820
has announced that, uh, you will be able to make female characters in create a player

01:55:58.820 --> 01:56:03.700
mode finally, which is interesting because if I remember right, they added the WNBA last

01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:04.420
year.

01:56:04.420 --> 01:56:09.060
So, I mean, that was good, but now you can finally make a female avatar if you want.

01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:14.980
Cause they do, they do this whole, uh, like they do live run the one streets, world tour

01:56:14.980 --> 01:56:15.700
live events.

01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:17.860
They do a lot of like street basketball.

01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:20.100
Like it's not all like just playing stuff in an arena, right?

01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:21.620
You do a lot of like street basketball and stuff.

01:56:21.620 --> 01:56:23.060
So why shouldn't you know?

01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:27.140
Well, I mean, honestly, in any of it, you should be able to play a woman, but I understand

01:56:27.140 --> 01:56:32.020
that unfortunately the NBA doesn't totally reflect that now that women are like fully

01:56:32.020 --> 01:56:36.020
integrated in that they have the two separate leagues, but that's a whole nother Oprah.

01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:38.820
But at least for like some of like the street ball and the stuff where it's just like, you

01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:41.700
know, friends playing a game together, you can do whatever you want.

01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:42.740
So that's pretty cool.

01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:43.060
Yeah.

01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:44.260
So yeah, very cool.

01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:50.180
Um, also the new trailer that kind of showcases this, they actually got Candace Parker from

01:56:50.180 --> 01:56:52.660
the Los Angeles Sparks to kind of be in the trailer.

01:56:52.660 --> 01:56:56.820
So they're, you know, trying to get, um, um, you know, some of the, some of the WNBA a

01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:58.580
little more involved with it, which is pretty cool.

01:56:58.580 --> 01:57:02.180
And I, I think this story popped up in our discord server, which if you're not on our

01:57:02.180 --> 01:57:05.140
discord, you should check that out over at vog network.com slash discord.

01:57:05.140 --> 01:57:06.660
We'll get the invite for you.

01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:09.780
Um, and, uh, I think it came up when the story was posted.

01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:13.940
I said, yeah, I mean, I, I, and I've said this before on the show, I was a fan of the

01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:14.820
WNBA.

01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:17.620
I say was because we had a team here in Sacramento.

01:57:17.620 --> 01:57:18.420
Now we don't anymore.

01:57:18.420 --> 01:57:20.500
And it's like, it's not the same thing.

01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:22.260
We don't have like hometown games to go to.

01:57:22.260 --> 01:57:23.700
Sadly, I miss it.

01:57:24.340 --> 01:57:24.980
Anyway.

01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:27.620
Uh, looking in chat at live.vog network.com.

01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:31.460
SSJ 100 map points out NHL also lets you make him play as women in the game.

01:57:31.460 --> 01:57:32.260
Yup.

01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:33.540
Uh, let's see.

01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:38.100
And, uh, dark Tetsuya says, I just thought this was a really cool story.

01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:41.380
Although NBA hang time does have it beat by about 20 years.

01:57:41.380 --> 01:57:45.060
It also had create a player mode and buried it amongst the normal male heads and weird

01:57:45.060 --> 01:57:45.940
costume heads.

01:57:45.940 --> 01:57:47.380
There are a couple of female heads you could pick.

01:57:47.940 --> 01:57:48.740
So pretty cool.

01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:49.780
All right.

01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:50.900
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:57:50.900 --> 01:57:52.900
Um, the next story was for dark soccer.

01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:54.100
Maybe you can cover it, Logan.

01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:54.420
Sure.

01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:54.900
Yeah.

01:57:54.900 --> 01:58:01.780
Um, so Castlevania season two is coming to Netflix on October 26th and they had a pretty

01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:07.060
cool trailer for that, but that's not all because a third season is already in the works

01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:08.500
and should be coming.

01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:10.340
Well, I'm assuming afterwards.

01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:13.060
Um, I still have yet to watch the first season.

01:58:13.060 --> 01:58:14.420
It was on my thing.

01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:14.660
Yeah.

01:58:14.660 --> 01:58:19.060
I wanted to, and I just didn't get around to it, but the second season looks awesome.

01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:24.100
And I guess I have some time to binge that, but, um, yeah, it looks pretty.

01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:25.460
No, I still need to watch it too.

01:58:25.460 --> 01:58:26.420
I'm so bad.

01:58:26.420 --> 01:58:27.300
It looks good.

01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:27.620
Yeah.

01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:32.580
I mean, so I'm, I'm interested to check it out and obviously it's popular.

01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:34.100
You know, we're getting in a third season.

01:58:34.660 --> 01:58:34.900
Yeah.

01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:37.940
I haven't really heard negative stuff about it, so I think it's being pretty well received.

01:58:37.940 --> 01:58:38.740
So that's cool.

01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:39.220
Yeah.

01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:39.860
All right.

01:58:39.860 --> 01:58:41.140
So can't wait.

01:58:41.140 --> 01:58:41.620
All right.

01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:42.100
All right.

01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:48.180
And then something that I didn't necessarily ask for, but it's coming is a forsaken.

01:58:48.180 --> 01:58:53.700
A HD remake of forsaken 20 years after the game came out.

01:58:53.700 --> 01:58:58.980
So night dive studios, they were a developer that, um, I guess did HD updates for Turok

01:58:58.980 --> 01:58:59.940
and Turok 2.

01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:02.500
They're going to be doing this as well.

01:59:03.140 --> 01:59:07.060
Forsaken was kind of a, it looked like a descent type game.

01:59:07.060 --> 01:59:13.540
Um, basically, you know, they're going to be updating it with, you know, 60 FPS.

01:59:13.540 --> 01:59:16.340
And of course, you know, higher resolution textures.

01:59:16.340 --> 01:59:20.580
Although, I mean, this is a game that came out on place, the original PlayStation, Nintendo

01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:21.140
64.

01:59:21.140 --> 01:59:24.100
So it is a little bit, you know, low poly and that type of stuff.

01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:25.780
But it's interesting.

01:59:25.780 --> 01:59:30.820
I did watch the actual, um, trailer for it, but I don't know.

01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:33.700
Um, and it's actually coming out very soon.

01:59:33.700 --> 01:59:37.300
It's going to be launching on, uh, July 31st.

01:59:37.860 --> 01:59:41.780
So right around the corner, a couple of days if you're interested.

01:59:41.780 --> 01:59:43.300
And that's on Xbox one and PC.

01:59:45.540 --> 01:59:45.940
All right.

01:59:45.940 --> 01:59:48.500
Was that the one that had the commercials that were like the future's forsaken?

01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:49.220
Was that that game?

01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:49.540
Yes.

01:59:49.540 --> 01:59:50.100
Oh, my God.

01:59:50.100 --> 01:59:51.140
I remember that.

01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:51.780
All right.

01:59:51.780 --> 01:59:53.940
Uh, anyway, one more story for you guys.

01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:55.300
Then we're going to open up the Skype line.

01:59:55.300 --> 01:59:56.420
So get ready to give us a call.

01:59:56.420 --> 01:59:58.660
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:59:58.660 --> 02:00:02.740
And, uh, oh, gosh, you knew if you saw this story, you just knew we were saving the best

02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:03.460
for last.

02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:04.100
That's right.

02:00:04.100 --> 02:00:07.860
There is a porn, a Fortnite coming.

02:00:07.860 --> 02:00:09.780
A Fortnite porn parody.

02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:11.140
And you know what the game is?

02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:11.940
Excuse the game.

02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:13.700
You know what the porn parody is called?

02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:14.820
I'm sorry.

02:00:14.900 --> 02:00:17.140
I just laugh just looking at it on the screen.

02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:17.860
You ready?

02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:20.420
Loki, what would you call porn parody of Fortnite?

02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:21.060
Fortnite?

02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:24.820
Um, you would think fuck night, right?

02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:25.460
Or something like that, right?

02:00:25.460 --> 02:00:25.940
Yeah.

02:00:25.940 --> 02:00:27.780
No, it's called Fortnut.

02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:32.980
That's stupid.

02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:39.220
It's a joint production between Wood Rocket and Pornhub.

02:00:39.220 --> 02:00:43.460
And I guess these people that are in this porn parody are semi-famous.

02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:44.180
Sure.

02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:48.100
And, uh, they have like a little colorful little thing going on here with this whole

02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:48.660
thing.

02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:50.900
Anyway, there's an NSFW trailer.

02:00:50.900 --> 02:00:53.220
If you want to look it up on YouTube, I'm not going to play it here.

02:00:53.220 --> 02:00:55.060
You can look it up on your own if you want.

02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:56.820
Uh, so check it out.

02:00:56.820 --> 02:01:01.460
Uh, and I guess there's a, one of the jokes goes, we need to find a chest.

02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:04.500
And then the, uh, camera zooms in on the boobs.

02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:06.260
So that's, you know, high brow humor.

02:01:06.260 --> 02:01:06.980
That's right.

02:01:06.980 --> 02:01:07.940
That's right.

02:01:07.940 --> 02:01:09.540
Anyway, uh, you can check that out.

02:01:09.540 --> 02:01:11.140
I'm sure Pornhub has that available.

02:01:11.140 --> 02:01:17.540
If you are interested in Fortnut, Fortnut, stupid.

02:01:17.540 --> 02:01:18.660
I watched the trailer.

02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:20.500
It was absolutely fucking terrible.

02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:25.620
Like it was like, it was like a parody of what porn parodies are.

02:01:25.620 --> 02:01:30.100
I mean, it's just, you're like, wow, that's some shit dialogue.

02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:32.180
Like just not even trying.

02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:33.940
It's just like, fuck it.

02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:34.820
You know, whatever.

02:01:35.940 --> 02:01:36.420
All right.

02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:39.220
Uh, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:01:39.220 --> 02:01:42.660
If you would like to give us a call tonight to talk about anything we've talked about

02:01:42.660 --> 02:01:44.580
or maybe have something else on the brain.

02:01:44.580 --> 02:01:44.980
I don't know.

02:01:44.980 --> 02:01:47.220
Anyway, the Skype line is open.

02:01:47.220 --> 02:01:51.140
And while we wait for somebody to maybe drop in on the Skype line, let me check if there's

02:01:51.140 --> 02:01:51.940
any last minute stories.

02:01:51.940 --> 02:01:53.700
I do have a last minute story.

02:01:53.700 --> 02:01:54.740
It's amazing.

02:01:55.300 --> 02:02:00.660
So there was a game that was created by Lucas arts not too long.

02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:03.460
Well, actually it was pretty long ago called day of the tentacle.

02:02:03.460 --> 02:02:03.940
Oh shit.

02:02:03.940 --> 02:02:04.420
Yeah.

02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:08.340
So there's a fan game now that is a sequel to that.

02:02:09.780 --> 02:02:15.380
Call return of the tentacle and you can play it for free so you can check it out actually

02:02:15.380 --> 02:02:18.500
at Katmik or Katmik.

02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:26.180
It's C A T M I C dot itch dot IO slash return dash of dash the dash tentacle.

02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:32.100
And it is basically done in the style of the original point and click game.

02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:38.500
And obviously the voice acting is kind of mimicked a little bit, but it's interesting.

02:02:39.300 --> 02:02:44.500
So I downloaded it before the cease and desist hits, but definitely go check it out because

02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:47.940
I mean, I love those Lucas arts games.

02:02:47.940 --> 02:02:48.440
Yeah.

02:02:50.020 --> 02:02:54.020
Didn't they do like a modern remake of day of the tentacle a little bit ago?

02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:54.180
Right.

02:02:54.180 --> 02:02:57.460
Because I remember the one for the 80s and then they did like a newer one a few years.

02:02:57.460 --> 02:02:57.620
Yeah.

02:02:57.620 --> 02:02:59.380
The newer one was the day of the tentacle.

02:02:59.380 --> 02:02:59.860
Yeah.

02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:01.300
They updated the HD one.

02:03:01.300 --> 02:03:03.220
This is done in the style of the HD one.

02:03:03.220 --> 02:03:03.460
Okay.

02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:03.700
Got it.

02:03:03.700 --> 02:03:05.220
So it's still the point.

02:03:05.220 --> 02:03:06.500
And it's all maniac mansion.

02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:09.060
It's all maniac mansion and guest characters.

02:03:09.700 --> 02:03:13.380
There's there's cameos from other stuff in there too.

02:03:13.380 --> 02:03:13.940
Okay.

02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:14.900
So cool.

02:03:14.900 --> 02:03:15.400
Yeah.

02:03:15.860 --> 02:03:16.180
Definitely.

02:03:16.180 --> 02:03:16.900
We're checking it.

02:03:16.900 --> 02:03:17.780
Be looking forward to that.

02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:19.220
I will have to play it.

02:03:19.220 --> 02:03:19.620
All right.

02:03:19.620 --> 02:03:20.660
I will have to as well.

02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:21.800
Okay.

02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:25.060
Well, I think, uh, I guess we're going to go ahead and wrap up.

02:03:25.060 --> 02:03:27.220
Um, because I'm, I'm also, I'm so tired.

02:03:27.220 --> 02:03:28.100
I'm really so exhausted.

02:03:28.100 --> 02:03:28.580
I'm ready.

02:03:28.580 --> 02:03:30.820
I'm ready to just vegetate a little bit.

02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:31.860
I'm sure y'all understand.

02:03:32.420 --> 02:03:36.340
But we'll be back, uh, next week to do it all over again in about seven days.

02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:38.180
Uh, as I always say at the end of every episode,

02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:41.380
if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, uh, please tell a friend or

02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:44.580
two about the show, uh, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer

02:03:44.580 --> 02:03:48.900
has a voice, but only if the voices are here to actually air them.

02:03:48.900 --> 02:03:54.820
Uh, so, uh, you can also, uh, send us an email, participate at orange lounge radio.com.

02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:58.820
And, um, you can, uh, you know, you can tweet us at OLR.

02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:02.660
You can join our discord vog network.com slash discord.

02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:06.260
Um, I guess that's, that's where I get to everybody's final thoughts.

02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:09.140
So Loki, what's your final thought?

02:04:09.140 --> 02:04:13.780
My final thought is I'm going to be still working on games in unreal.

02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:20.020
Now I'm checking it out and seeing how that goes on my spawner screwed right now.

02:04:20.020 --> 02:04:22.180
And we're just following along with the lesson.

02:04:22.180 --> 02:04:23.700
So I don't really feel like I'm creating too much.

02:04:23.700 --> 02:04:25.940
Although I did like adapt some of it too.

02:04:26.740 --> 02:04:30.180
It's just, and the gut, the artwork that's there is provided by somebody else.

02:04:30.180 --> 02:04:31.140
So it's not that great.

02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:35.540
I kind of redo everything from scratch, which is more of a learning something and learning

02:04:35.540 --> 02:04:37.620
how unreal works and everything.

02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:43.060
So I'm looking forward to seeing how, uh, so that works cause it, I don't know.

02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:49.380
I'll make my own thing later, but it I'm just making this, going through this lesson.

02:04:50.340 --> 02:04:51.220
All right.

02:04:51.220 --> 02:04:57.220
And, uh, my final thought tonight is, um, I'm, I'm ready to just go.

02:04:57.220 --> 02:05:00.260
I actually, I need to take a little bit of a walk to get some steps in and get,

02:05:00.260 --> 02:05:04.820
I haven't sent any pokey gifts today and Loki and I are about to become three star friends.

02:05:05.060 --> 02:05:08.020
Like today, that's, that's a 50,000 experience bonus.

02:05:08.020 --> 02:05:09.940
Uh, I actually hit three stars.

02:05:09.940 --> 02:05:11.220
I hit three stars with a few people.

02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:12.580
So it is 50,000?

02:05:12.580 --> 02:05:14.180
It's 50,000 XP.

02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:16.500
Oh, so you know, what's funny is the egg works on that.

02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:17.220
Yes, it does.

02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:19.860
So I did that last time I got a hundred thousand from somebody.

02:05:19.860 --> 02:05:22.020
And then I think best friends is a hundred.

02:05:22.020 --> 02:05:23.620
The four stars is a hundred thousand.

02:05:23.620 --> 02:05:24.020
I think.

02:05:24.020 --> 02:05:24.340
Cool.

02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:25.060
I heard that's what it is.

02:05:25.620 --> 02:05:27.220
Obviously it takes a while to hit that.

02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:28.660
It's like 90 days to hit that.

02:05:28.660 --> 02:05:34.100
But, uh, my friend, uh, up in Toronto is pro is the one that every single day,

02:05:34.100 --> 02:05:36.260
since it started, we've traded gifts.

02:05:36.260 --> 02:05:38.260
And so I hit three stars with him first.

02:05:38.260 --> 02:05:40.340
And then the very next day, like act deft.

02:05:40.340 --> 02:05:44.340
And I think, uh, as 200 Matt, like at the same time, we hit three stars.

02:05:44.340 --> 02:05:48.100
I've hit it with, um, act deft and with magma lemur.

02:05:48.660 --> 02:05:49.460
Oh, cool.

02:05:49.460 --> 02:05:49.860
Yes.

02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:50.180
Yeah.

02:05:50.180 --> 02:05:50.740
Neat.

02:05:50.740 --> 02:05:51.300
All right.

02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:55.620
Well, uh, I will try to get you a gift so we can hit three stars as well.

02:05:55.620 --> 02:05:56.020
Anyway.

02:05:56.020 --> 02:05:57.380
Um, that's it.

02:05:57.380 --> 02:05:58.020
We're done.

02:05:58.020 --> 02:05:58.580
We're out of here.

02:05:58.580 --> 02:06:00.020
