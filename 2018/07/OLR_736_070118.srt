00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tonight, rumors are growing that Google plans to compete in the video game console space. Would you be down for a Google Console? And more importantly, will you be able to play Fortnite Crossplay on it? All this and more on another episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello, my friends, and welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, July the 1st of 2018, episode number 736 of our show.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Happy Canada Day to all of our pals up north. Happy We're Back night because we were off last week. No better way to celebrate a birthday of OLR than taking a week off.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But we're back to start another year full of Orange Lounge Radio episodes after our 16th birthday two weeks ago. With you in studio, myself, Rob Roberts, and with me, as always, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh, hi.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hello, hello.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hello.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thank you for cat-sitting Mr. Smoosh while I was away in Chicago. Appreciate it.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
He was a good kitty.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Had a very good time, and I brought you back some candy.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes, and I'm going to have some right now.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Good. Those little, so what do you call this place? Vosges?

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
V-O-S-G-E-S.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Okay, so I'm assuming, they don't have them here. I'm assuming it's a thing in Chicago or maybe generally the Midwest.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Actually, I did find that there's supposed to be one in New Orleans, and I think there's one in Southern California.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh, okay.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But I didn't know about it.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So maybe Southern California. So not really close to here.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh my God, it smells so good.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But anyway, those peanut butter things I bought, those are the best things I've ever had in my entire life, as far as candy goes.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So I'm really excited for Jamie to try one here on air. So she's going to open that box.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I will say this too about Jamie is that she went with me to accompany me right before I left for Chicago,

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
because she's been an owner of one of these devices, and I finally bit the bullet and bought myself for my birthday an Apple Watch.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I said I would never get on the Apple Watch train, and here I am. I finally bought one.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You know what finally did it for me? You know what finally brought me over to the dark side?

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
All the exercise motivating that it does.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And I have to admit, the whole bugging me to stand up and all that stuff is actually really motivating.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Speaking of exercise, time for candy. So you're going to eat one of these?

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Got sea salt on top. Let's take a bite.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Alright, so she's going to eat one right now.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh, fucking hell.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Right?

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Aren't those amazing?

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Praise Jesus. Now that I don't even believe in Jesus.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Leave it to the resident Jewish girl here on the show to say praise Jesus for fighting into a chocolate.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I love it. Alright. Yeah, I know. I know. I know. Alright.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Fucking A.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
While she's indulging in that, you need to, you need to put those, you know what you need to do?

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You need to put those in a glass case, dark Sakura, which is like in case of shark week, break glass.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And then you have those ready to go.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Girl, it's so rich. I'm just going to sit here in the afterglow and smoke a cigarette.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Alright. Sounds good. Just blow the smoke outside.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Alright. Say hello to tech master. Loki is also here. Hi, Loki.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Hi.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hi. You may have to try to bribe your way to one of those chocolates later.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I know you don't usually eat food.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Is it chocolate and peanut butter?

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's chocolate and peanut butter.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I fucking hate chocolate and peanut butter.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
God damn it, Loki. You hate everything.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I did bring something else though that Loki might be interested in.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What's that?

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Honey butter potato chips.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll try some of those. That sounds good.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Maybe. That's just like weird.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
They're really fucking good.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If it's not meat, Loki doesn't care. You know how to get Loki?

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It tastes like the honey butter from, um, what was that salad place we used to have out here?

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Not sweet tomatoes, but, uh, the soup.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Fresh choice.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Fresh choice.

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's really good.

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It is good. Anyway.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But you, you brought dinner tonight from one of those make your own pizza places that they're

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
like, where did these things come from?

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Like, it's like overnight we have, what is it?

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The pizza rev, the pyology, the mod pizza, like all these.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Somebody took the idea of a Chipotle and applied it to pizza.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
All these places popped up like overnight.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's crazy.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And it's just like, I didn't really necessarily want anything fancy.

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I just wanted pepperoni, you know, but I added a few extra things on top of it.

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Garlic.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But honestly, they're like, I like my LG better.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Like, I don't know.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This is the first time I've had mod pizza and it's just kind of, it's all right.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
They're really all the same to me.

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
They really, they're not all the same because they had different sauces and stuff and that stuff

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
does make a difference.

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
All right.

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Uh, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com because part of what part of what makes Warren

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
songs radio special is the fact that we have been broadcasting live over the past 16 years.

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And we're always with you guys in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and you can chat

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
along with the show and say things like calling me a sheep, which some people are doing about

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
my new watch purchase.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
To which I say, fuck them.

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
To which I say, suck it.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
All right.

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You know, you know what, know what people treat their technology like fucking religion

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and you want to know what giving people shit about the technology that they like is just

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
as stupid as giving people shit for their religion.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't like, honestly, it's not that important to me.

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I, if you want a Fitbit, get a Fitbit.

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I realized the newer Fitbits do like a lot of the same shit.

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
If that's what you want, go ahead.

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't care.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Like it doesn't.

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
My Monique heart voice is kicking in here.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Um, but, uh, I just do what you want.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's all good.

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Just, you know, I just chose to get the Apple watch.

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I definitely wanted my rainbow band, which Jamie helped hook me up with.

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And then I have the little, the little face on the watch that does a little dancing rainbow

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
too.

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I got robbed for his birthday and I fed him and bought me.

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yes.

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I appreciate it.

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Let's see.

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Also looking in chat at live.vog network.com.

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Uh, let's see.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
A rage in here talking about Loki hating chocolate and peanut butter together.

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yeah, I just don't.

121
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I like them both individually.

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I just don't like the combination saying, uh, of course, Loki hates everything.

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He's a gamer.

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Gamers hate everything.

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Remember?

126
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I like both.

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I just don't like the combination of flavors.

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I like Nintendo switch and I like Xbox one, but how dare Minecraft put them together?

130
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
No, it's nothing like that.

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Uh, let's see.

132
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It is a little confusing to have two copies of Minecraft though on my switch now.

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It is.

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Uh, tiger call on chat says, can Rob make calls on his Apple watch?

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I think so, but I have the one.

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You absolutely can.

137
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah, but mine doesn't have the cellular cause I didn't need it.

138
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Like I do have an iPhone, so I was like, well, I always have my iPhone, so I'm not worried

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
about the whole, like you have to be near it.

140
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And I do notice they work pretty far apart still.

141
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And it's not like your watch immediately shuts down.

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If you get away from your phone, like it still tracks all the stuff.

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And then the next time you're close to your phone, it kind of, I can leave my watch in

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
the living room and I have to be about a house and a half away outside through the building

145
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
before it realizes I don't have my phone with me.

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah, yeah.

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Same, same, same thing at work.

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So anyway, uh, let's see, we're going to get into, uh, some news stories here.

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
In fact, I want to get into our kickoff topic tonight, uh, where I want to talk about some

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
of the things that we missed last week while we weren't here.

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Cause, uh, we did miss quite a few things last week, including official news that Yoshi

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
on the switch was delayed to 2019.

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Everything's delayed to 2019.

154
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Kind of, well, I mean, and not too surprising when you figure that it didn't make the E3

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
press conference and a lot of people were asking, where's Yoshi?

156
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So the fact that it got delayed to 2019, probably not the biggest surprise in the world.

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And honestly, is Nintendo doing anything different than the other companies?

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Like practically all those games that Sony showed at their thing, except Spiderman are

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
2019 games.

160
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So you know what, whatever is last of us to 2019 as well.

161
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I believe I don't think they've committed to a date yet.

162
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Have they?

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't know.

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Anyway.

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Um, let's see.

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Also, uh, I guess, uh, captain toad treasure tracker, speaking of Nintendo news, the world's

167
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
dedicated to super Mario three D world are being replaced by super Mario Odyssey ones,

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
which, okay.

169
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So it's not going to be a direct port of captain toad on Wii U.

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Why not just put both in there?

171
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That's true.

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Why not?

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh, let's just take it out.

174
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Why?

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Maybe there'll be DLC.

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I don't know.

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Who knows?

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Uh, let's see.

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Nintendo and Disney are teaming up to make a Nintendo switch themed game show.

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Nintendo switch family showdown.

181
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It is a new show that's going to be on the Disney channel, Disney XD, and I think online

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
the Disney or the Disney now streaming out cause you know, everybody has their own fucking

183
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
streaming app in this day and age.

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So anyway, four families will battle it out for points and prizes by playing Nintendo

185
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
switch games against each other.

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So it's kind of like, I guess like a modern day Nick arcade meets family double dare

187
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
or something.

188
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't know.

189
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Which by the way, speaking of game shows and speaking of double dare, Loki, I know you

190
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
had to have watched the new one.

191
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I didn't watch the new one, but I know it came back.

192
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah, no, it did come back.

193
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I didn't watch it either.

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Cause I was, I have no, I don't have Nickelodeon, so I don't really, I will know cause we don't

195
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
have cable.

196
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I thought, Oh, so I was like Nickelodeon.

197
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I thought it was a part of like basic cable.

198
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Okay.

199
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No, it's not actually basic.

200
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
No.

201
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Basic cable is your local channels and that's it.

202
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
All right.

203
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Well anyway, um, I know a lot of people were looking forward to the double dare.

204
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I like that they have a new host and they have Mark Summers.

205
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I liked that they kind of used both.

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I thought that was a good way to kind of nod to the classic, but still keep it like very

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
modern.

208
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So anyway, back to the Disney game show, uh, searching for collectibles in Mario Odyssey

209
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
might be one round head to head Mario tennis aces, just dance, dance off.

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So that'll be a hoot and a holler.

211
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Anyway.

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't know.

213
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That sounds really stupid.

214
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's, it's going to be a family game show.

215
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I get it, but it's just, it's hard to ignore the just product.

216
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's, it's just, it's like an advertisement break man in chat wants to know, uh, when

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
is that coming out?

218
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Probably 2019 like everything else probably.

219
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I don't think it's this year.

220
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I just took a bite of my other chocolate.

221
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So, okay.

222
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So not to derail, but that's what Jamie does.

223
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So you opened the other chocolate bar that I brought you, which was what it was a stout

224
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
chocolate bar.

225
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's a burnt caramel smoke and stout, but it doesn't taste like caramel.

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So it's good.

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Um, but I can get the stout taste in it cause chocolate and Guinness are amazing together.

228
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's got like a cream in it and you have to let me try like a little bite at some point

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
just cause I'm curious.

230
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Super curious.

231
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
All right.

232
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Anyway, go ahead and have some.

233
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm trying to do a show here.

234
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Girl, put this in your mouth and eat it.

235
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
If you insist.

236
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
All right.

237
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Hold on.

238
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Okay.

239
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That is pretty fucking good.

240
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Right.

241
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You want some?

242
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's pretty amazing.

243
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Moki hates everything you forgot.

244
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
All right.

245
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I would still be ready to find it and offer.

246
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Um, the cross platform debates heat up.

247
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I think we're going to get into it a little bit on tonight's show as well.

248
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But, um, I think you guys probably saw the commercial that showed up, uh, on Twitter

249
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
at least.

250
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I think it's, um, around social media and stuff.

251
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The whole survive together.

252
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
There's a Minecraft ad that's full on Microsoft and Nintendo did this ad together and there's

253
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
an Xbox player and a Nintendo player.

254
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And it's really cute because the Xbox player is wearing green, the Nintendo players weren't

255
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
playing red.

256
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's, isn't it interesting how like we have the three, like, I know they're not the three

257
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
primary colors.

258
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I guess they're the three light colors, red, green, blue, right?

259
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Cause I know primary is red, yellow, blue, but Xbox is green.

260
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Nintendo is now red and Sony is blue.

261
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So we have a green and a red commercial that came together and it says survive together.

262
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's really cute.

263
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Did you see the commercial?

264
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yes.

265
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yeah.

266
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So it's a, and then of course that led to all these parodies where people were making

267
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
like a blue screen that said survive alone, you know, things like that kind of taking

268
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
jabs at Sony.

269
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But anyway, uh, an ex Sony developer said that the PlayStation four console cross platform

270
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
block is all about the money.

271
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Uh, duh.

272
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
We all know it's about greed and we all know it's about Sony just trying to sit on their

273
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
little throne.

274
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But the problem is this little reputation is going to hurt them in the long, the long

275
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
game is not good with a strategy.

276
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That's the problem with this.

277
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
People are going to fucking remember this when the Xbox two isn't, I'd call it, we all

278
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
know it's not going to be called that, but when the next Xbox is announced, Sony can't

279
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
stick to these types of rules or they're only going to allow Microsoft to punch them the

280
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
way that they punched Microsoft at E3 a few years ago when they first failed PS4.

281
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So just look out Sony, don't do this.

282
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
All right.

283
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Anyway, uh, let's see other news from last week.

284
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Final Fantasy seven remake.

285
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It is still happening.

286
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Tetsuya Nomura expressing a little regret that they announced it so early, but they

287
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
kind of had to because of all the rumors and talk, you know, uh, also they're saying the

288
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
remake will dive deeper into avalanche members and other characters, which makes me think

289
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
that this isn't so much a remake as it is a re-imagining if they're expanding on certain

290
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
elements of the story and changing things like this.

291
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's not really a remake, is it?

292
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Remakes can be, you know, covering different stuff.

293
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I guess that's true.

294
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I guess so.

295
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But doesn't that seem more like a re-imagining Logie?

296
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Maybe a little bit, but I hope that they have more like the advent children's stuff in there.

297
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah.

298
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Let's go even beyond the story.

299
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Uh, some thoughts in our chat at live.vognetwork.com.

300
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Uh, as Joe and Hunter Matt said, they needed to announce it before Walmart Canada announced

301
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
it.

302
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Very true.

303
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Uh, JD says maybe they're pulling in some of the prequel games like crisis core before

304
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
crisis.

305
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Oh, so kind of like alluding to some of the other things that happen in the side stories.

306
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That's a good, a billion of side story games that they had good call out, I suppose.

307
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Uh, and then one of the biggest stories that came out the week we were gone, uh, evil G

308
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
or GameStop, but we sometimes call them evil G.

309
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Uh, they're in talks with private firms about a buyout.

310
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So it looks like you also heard the other story though too.

311
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What's that?

312
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
They're going to carry comics.

313
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah, I did hear that too.

314
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So GameStop is definitely having to change a little bit probably because of the ramp

315
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
up in more and more games being distributed digitally.

316
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So they're not content with putting the, the local, uh, video game stores out of business.

317
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
They're also now aiming for the jugular for the comic book industry.

318
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
They're trying to, they're basically trying to diversify cause there's no margin in games.

319
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And so even with game sales, you know, and I imagine even less so with digital stuff,

320
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
they're not making a lot of money on that.

321
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And I'm guessing that maybe the used market's not what it used to be.

322
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And so now they're making money from other things that are higher margin, like, you know,

323
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
collectibles, 50% pop figures.

324
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It is, it is.

325
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And you know, judging by my kids and stuff, most of their attention was on all the collectible

326
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
stuff that they had there and not so much the games.

327
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So these are basically going to become nerd stores across America.

328
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's probably like a, like a hot topic, but just gaming centric.

329
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Interesting.

330
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Isn't that box lunch?

331
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Box lunch is actually a lot better than hot topic.

332
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I like, I like box lunch a lot personally.

333
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yeah.

334
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I have the stuff in there.

335
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
They had a Retsuko shirt I want, but they wanted like 40 bucks for it.

336
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So whatever.

337
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Do they have those?

338
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I don't know if everybody in our chat would know what that store is, but it's in like,

339
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
if you go to this place called the mall, which most towns still have them, not all.

340
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Wait, wait, wait.

341
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Sorry.

342
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's where your Sears used to be.

343
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
A line from a movie pops in my head.

344
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
He took us to something called the mall and something called credit cards.

345
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Sorry.

346
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Is Bill and Ted's excellent.

347
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh my God.

348
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That's, that's a throwback.

349
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I was thinking mall rats.

350
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If you want to see like malls at their heyday height, go check out mall rats with Jay and

351
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
silent Bob.

352
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Pay attention to the name of the stores.

353
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yeah.

354
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And see if you can see the stereo image.

355
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Anyway.

356
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Uh, where were we?

357
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh yes.

358
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
GameStop malls.

359
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah.

360
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Oh, and also, you know, along the lines of GameStop looking for a buyer, you know, Toys

361
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,560
R Us is officially closed now that I saw the memes of the Jeffrey with his bags packed,

362
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,120
ready to go and all the, you know, because I missed the last day, I was hoping to go

363
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,800
like one more time before they closed.

364
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,360
They didn't really have anything in there though.

365
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,840
I guy looked, there was nothing.

366
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,800
I did not set foot into a Toys R Us one time during that entire sale.

367
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,340
What do I win?

368
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,600
You win not getting stuff for really cheap.

369
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
No.

370
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,040
Well, isn't it all going to end up at the dollar store now anyway?

371
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,600
No, they'd sold it off.

372
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,760
I mean, well I think like a lot of like, especially like I was looking at Legos, so a lot of Lego

373
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
stuff that was there.

374
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,480
I think the local hobby shop that sells Legos bought most of that because you know, it's

375
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,480
50% off.

376
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,480
That reminds me.

377
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,480
I got you something.

378
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,000
You know, they could throw the markup stuff.

379
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh yeah.

380
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The Lego tape stuff.

381
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That's awesome.

382
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It was like the last one they had.

383
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What is that?

384
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's tape.

385
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,680
You like stick it on your wall and you can stick stuff to it.

386
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
That's cool.

387
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,760
Thank you.

388
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,880
Um, but yeah, they, I saw, I got like a nice sign, you know, save like 80 bucks off of

389
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
it.

390
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,880
Huh?

391
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,080
I bought one of those and I bought Jenga, but it was like not real Jenga.

392
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,520
They had like my, uh, I was speaking with my mom yesterday and she went there and bought

393
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,600
Christmas gifts for the kids because they had a lot of stuff and there was a lot of

394
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,280
like big ticket items that my kids wanted and I'm like, I wish this was cheaper.

395
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,120
Um, so I was waiting for it to go cheaper and that's why it was actually, that was my

396
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,080
next trip was going to be is buying that stuff for Christmas.

397
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,280
So maybe she took care of that.

398
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,360
Um, something that I noticed in our little, uh, thread where we compile all the stories

399
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,680
where a dark Tetsuya helps us out and some of our story compilation for each show, uh,

400
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:51,000
he kind of called this out as a piece from last week that he thought was worth mentioning

401
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,800
and dark soccer since this has to do with retro games, namely SNK, I think this is something

402
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,680
that probably be up your alley, but you know how they're doing this SNK 40th anniversary

403
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,440
collection that's coming out later this year.

404
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,740
That's kind of like the, you know, all the old school games in one package.

405
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:10,920
Apparently, uh, some of the games have been redesigned to work as twin stick games because

406
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:16,200
some games, well, some games originally had a rotary control, so that can't be replicated

407
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,100
on a controller because the rotary is kind of unique in its design.

408
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,460
So what happened is that, you know, the ports were mapping buttons to rotate clockwise or

409
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,660
counterclockwise and it just didn't work.

410
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,240
So now the games play as twin stick basically.

411
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,800
So instead of, you know, turn it, you basically have one to point, I guess like, uh, you know,

412
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
playing like what?

413
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,100
Smash TV, robotron, those types of games.

414
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
So that's kind of cool.

415
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
That's pretty cool.

416
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,100
Yeah.

417
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,280
So, uh, I developed, I was already sold on this collection anyway, cause I'm a sucker

418
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,080
for retro compilations.

419
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,220
So that just makes me, uh, all the more interested in this.

420
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,220
That's for sure.

421
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,760
So there you go.

422
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,920
So that's a little bit of what y'all missed last week while we were off.

423
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,820
You also missed Rob's birthday.

424
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,820
That's right.

425
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,820
Yes.

426
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,180
My 40th birthday was on Monday.

427
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,580
Tuesday was on Tuesday.

428
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,580
Yeah.

429
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,580
I'm at that age where I forget.

430
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,580
Yeah.

431
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,580
My 40th birthday was Tuesday.

432
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,220
Your 40 Stravaganza.

433
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,220
I didn't forget.

434
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:20,220
So I figured, you know, as a gift to not only the listeners, but to Rob, you know, okay.

435
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,200
So because I, it's more for Rob, but you know, the listeners I'm sure can enjoy, you know,

436
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,500
being that I have no idea what's coming by the way.

437
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,980
He is not, he just said that there's a birthday present.

438
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,140
Yes.

439
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,900
And, and, and Bobby will appreciate this.

440
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,340
So I'll be right back and I'll bring you one in.

441
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,340
Okay.

442
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,340
Oh Lord.

443
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,220
Did he, he hid something.

444
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,680
He's bringing you ahead.

445
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
I know.

446
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,680
I'm fucking scared.

447
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,780
That means it was too big to hide.

448
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,940
So he dropped it in the living room.

449
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,940
Oh my God.

450
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,940
This is gigantic.

451
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,940
What the fuck is this?

452
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,940
Oh my God.

453
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,940
Oh shit.

454
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,940
Oh my God.

455
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,940
I'm scared.

456
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,940
This is.

457
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,940
What?

458
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,260
I figured since you've been putting it off for too long, it's about time that you got

459
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,040
on the whole VR craze.

460
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,820
So not only you got that, but also one of my favorite games on the system, which is

461
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:16,020
uh, until Don Russia, he bought me a PS VR, I can't believe it.

462
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,020
And it does.

463
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,020
Yep.

464
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,020
It has Skyrim.

465
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,020
Cool.

466
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,020
They all have Skyrim nowadays.

467
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,020
Thank you so much.

468
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,020
Oh my God.

469
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,020
I'm like speechless.

470
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,020
It's great.

471
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,020
You know, who's going to be mad at you though?

472
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,020
What?

473
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,420
Because just to, just before I left for Chicago, I was like, Oh, when I get back from Chicago,

474
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,380
I'll look into buy your PS VR.

475
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,380
Oops.

476
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,380
Oops.

477
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,860
No, I love it.

478
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,380
Oh, there's something else in here.

479
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,380
Yeah.

480
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,380
Until Dawn.

481
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,380
Cause it sets.

482
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,380
Oh no.

483
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,380
It's a great game.

484
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,740
Oh no.

485
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,740
I love it though.

486
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,740
Thank you.

487
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,740
Look, you really did.

488
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,740
I know these things aren't cheap.

489
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,740
Thank you so much.

490
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,740
Holy shit.

491
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,740
No problem.

492
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,740
Wow.

493
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,020
So I figured it'd be fun because you know, you do the streaming stuff and everything.

494
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,380
So Oh, for sure.

495
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,380
And I am super looking forward to Tetris effect.

496
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,380
Exactly.

497
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,380
That was finally the thing.

498
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,380
Well, let me go.

499
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,380
Okay.

500
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,380
I have games already.

501
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,380
So you have rez.

502
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,380
Yep.

503
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,380
You know, I get to play rez.

504
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,380
Oh my God.

505
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,380
I'm so excited.

506
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,380
Yeah.

507
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,380
Super excited.

508
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,380
Looking in chat over at live.vog network.com.

509
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,100
Uh, as 200 Matt says, Mr. Smoosh is like a new thing.

510
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
That's mine now.

511
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,100
Yep.

512
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,100
Uh, blowing shit up.

513
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,140
Man says everybody gets a Skyrim and dark Tetsuya says, Oh man, I want to see that on

514
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,140
Twitch.

515
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,260
You got it.

516
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,300
We'll do, we'll do some Twitch streams for the PS4 later this week.

517
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,220
I can't, I can't do it tonight cause I'm not going to get set up that fast, but uh, this

518
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,220
week for sure.

519
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,220
That's great.

520
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,220
Oh my God.

521
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,220
Thank you so much.

522
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,220
They have most of the games are digital.

523
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,020
So you have to get some digital games.

524
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:43,180
Like I just, I picked up like some stuff this week by seven played it yet.

525
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:50,140
Uh, just in time ink, which is kind of a cross between like if you think, um, super hot and

526
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,520
job simulator.

527
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,720
So you, you're trying to stop people from dying from tragedies.

528
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,940
And so it's, it's hilarious though.

529
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,560
So like I really want to play that, but that'd be a great like streaming game right there.

530
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:07,460
Uh, rage nator in chat says, now that Rob Roberts has a PSVR, I have to ask the million

531
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,460
dollar question.

532
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,240
What is the TTP with the PSVR?

533
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,660
First off, you nasty.

534
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,920
Second off, how do you know it hasn't already happened?

535
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,960
Just don't be nasty.

536
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,920
Maybe I'll do a Twitch stream with no pants.

537
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,920
You'll never know.

538
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
You'll never know.

539
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
All right.

540
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,920
Anyway.

541
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
Nasty, nasty.

542
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,920
Uh, let's see.

543
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,660
Uh, going to chat at live.vognetwork.com, uh, dungeon buster says I can only imagine

544
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,540
what it's like in VR, but I liked it.

545
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,040
Good luck on saving everyone.

546
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,460
Uh, tiger claw wants you to know is if you don't already Loki ready player one is coming

547
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,600
out digitally this Tuesday already pre-ordered the digital version.

548
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,680
Yeah, I'm in no hurry to get the digital version again.

549
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,360
I mean, I've already seen it like two or three times.

550
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,680
So yeah, okay.

551
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,360
I wanted to go see ant man and the loss this weekend.

552
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,620
However, I have been informed by my wife that the Whitney Houston documentary is coming

553
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,880
to theaters that same day.

554
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,280
So unfortunately I will be seeing that instead.

555
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:19,320
So, Oh, well, I'll have to see it on the weekend.

556
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,400
I still, I, I can't wrap my hand around that.

557
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,440
It's not about learning your spouse to see something they don't want to see.

558
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,440
I would take your wife to see the Whitney Houston documentary cause I would see that.

559
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,440
I didn't even know one was coming.

560
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,600
I knew there's a mr Rogers documentary that I want to see.

561
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
Yeah.

562
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Maybe you guys can negotiate.

563
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
See that one.

564
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,320
But like if Dan was like, Hey, I'm going to go see this.

565
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
You want to go?

566
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,160
I'd be like, no, that's, that's with me.

567
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,160
That's Alan and scary movies when he wants to go see, I don't know what are the big scary

568
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
moves?

569
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
It, he wants to go see it.

570
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,520
I'm like, don't you have other friends locally that want to go see it like, you know, that

571
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,520
that's everything.

572
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
He's free.

573
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
All right.

574
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,120
I mean, I went and saw, was it the bodyguard musical and everything?

575
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,200
So I mean, I forgot with, uh, uh, who was it?

576
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
Crystal waters, right?

577
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Or something?

578
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
No.

579
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Uh, one of those divas from the nineties.

580
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Right.

581
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Here's somebody, but I don't remember who it was.

582
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Yeah.

583
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
But it was all right.

584
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
I mean, it was okay.

585
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,200
Okay.

586
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,000
Was it right?

587
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
But it's okay.

588
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Were you going to make it any way stop?

589
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,400
You want to know how many freaking drag queens I've heard do that song?

590
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
All of them.

591
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
All right.

592
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
All of them, Rob, all of them.

593
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,600
Let's get into how is your gaming week and the types of video games that you've been

594
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,120
playing this week?

595
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,120
Uh, dark soccer.

596
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,160
How was your gaming week?

597
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,160
I didn't play a damn thing except for the stuff I play on the phone.

598
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,880
You want to know why?

599
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,640
Because of awesome games done quick.

600
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:56,560
I'm also right now buying a legend of Zelda t-shirt, but anyway, back to this, um, I have

601
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,400
been playing Pokemon and I've been playing, um, idle pouring.

602
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,360
Um, but I really like, I watched the finale last night so I could watch the final fantasy

603
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,040
six play through and I really super enjoyed it.

604
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,040
And it was just so much memory on that, that I think I'm actually planning on starting

605
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:19,780
that up again, um, to play on my, um, um, my, uh, SNES classic.

606
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:26,080
So I'm thinking about it anyway, but that's really been about what I've been doing anyway

607
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:33,560
just because I really haven't wanted to do anything else.

608
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,560
All right.

609
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
Then we'll move on to Loki.

610
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:41,280
Um, I didn't play a whole ton of stuff this week, but I did play, um, I got luminous remastered.

611
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,600
So I played a little bit of that on the switch and it was fine.

612
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:52,960
Um, I tried a little bit of the new Minecraft for the switch, so it's kind of confusing

613
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
that.

614
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,680
So they have the Minecraft switch edition, which is its own thing.

615
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:02,400
And then the Minecraft that's kind of everybody, you know, the one that's tied in with, um,

616
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,640
Xbox live, the one that you can play cross platform on is its own thing, which is really

617
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,840
weird.

618
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,080
And then on top of that, like I don't really care for the port that they did for that one

619
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:20,320
because it's probably good on TV, but on the screen, they didn't account for the size of

620
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,120
the screen and the resolution.

621
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:28,200
So all of the text boxes are really small and it makes it kind of difficult to see what

622
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,200
you're doing in there.

623
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,040
I mean, whatever, that's a small nitpick, but it's kind of annoying.

624
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:37,280
It's like, ah, I kind of rather play the other one that would look much nicer, but whatever.

625
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:42,380
I just wish you had an option to like tweak some of that stuff, but whatever, it's, it's

626
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,380
all good.

627
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,560
The aquatic updates are pretty awesome.

628
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:49,200
I haven't really played too much of it on my PC, so I'll have to check that out.

629
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,160
But yeah, it was kind of fun.

630
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,560
Most of my time was playing Pokemon go just because I feel obligated now to get enough

631
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,840
gifts to send to everybody every single day.

632
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,840
And so it's the struggle, it's just like I have 11 friends and it's just like, dude,

633
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,880
I had to drive by all of these pokey stops to get stuff and it's just, you have to let

634
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,140
it go at some point.

635
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,800
Now again, I got into this on Bobby show a little bit.

636
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,160
I'm not trying to be that guy, but the reality is between the people I know that play ingress

637
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,580
between the people on Facebook, Twitter, I have 73 friends on Pokemon go.

638
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,240
So like I'm, I'm not going to be able to send out that many gifts a day.

639
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,480
I just, I just can't, like I physically cannot visit 73 pokey stops in a day and that's assuming

640
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,640
each stop gives me a gift, which is not even the case.

641
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:36,640
So I kind of have to prioritize like who are the local people that I'm more likely to raid

642
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,920
with and trade with because I want to increase those friendships faster.

643
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,320
It's like, I'll send gifts out to the long distance people as I can, but like, yeah,

644
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,840
Oh my God, I just, I don't get enough gifts and they did nerf it a bit cause you were

645
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,540
getting like a ton of stuff from those gifts and then now it's a little less, but I mean,

646
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,920
I'm still having trouble like key.

647
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,360
I've had to expand my inventory twice just to be able to keep up with everything and

648
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,760
it's still not enough.

649
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,200
I'm like, I'm trying to catch everything.

650
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,720
I literally am catching everything I see, even if I don't want it just to use up the

651
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,180
pokey balls and it's not enough.

652
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,720
I just can't, I can't throw enough of them away.

653
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,200
So that's what, that's why I played this week.

654
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
All right.

655
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,040
Um, my gaming week, uh, I've also played the brand new Luminous remastered on Nintendo

656
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,040
Switch.

657
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,280
I'll probably play it after the show tonight on the live streams.

658
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,280
That'll be fun.

659
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,920
Um, but, um, yeah, I'm, I'm a fan, obviously.

660
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,640
I love that they redid Luminous.

661
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,980
It is pretty much the original game, but this time, you know, I can play on my HDTV as opposed

662
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,480
to a little portable device.

663
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
So that's cool.

664
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,440
And like I realized that they did do a version of Luminous on Xbox 360, they did do a version

665
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,600
of it on PC, you know, so it's not like I haven't played Luminous on my TV before, but

666
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,420
it's the first opportunity to play those old skins, you know, shine in, move your body

667
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,000
and like, you know, those, those like older skins from that game.

668
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,280
Um, so it's really cool to get to experience all that again.

669
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,780
And the fact that it's on the Switch, you know, being portable and all that stuff.

670
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,780
Very cool.

671
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:05,120
So, uh, yeah, big fan of shine it or of shine it, of lumen.

672
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,600
I mean, what else is there in Luminous, it's shine in the game, but no, seriously, a big

673
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,620
fan of Luminous.

674
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:17,360
If you've never played it and you like puzzle games at all, you have to give this a try.

675
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,920
If you like music games, I kind of feel like you have to give this a try.

676
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,160
Now, if you're not a fan of puzzle games, then I don't think this one's going to win

677
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,120
you over, you know, because you're probably, you're probably going to look at it and go,

678
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,680
it's kind of like the same thing over and over.

679
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,040
Like if you can't see the value in a game like Tetris, then you're not going to see

680
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,720
it in Luminous either.

681
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,200
But like, have you seen, speaking of Tetris, by the way, have you guys seen some of the

682
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,560
gameplay that's out there now for Tetris effects because now that I don't know if critics have

683
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:49,600
a copy of it or somehow, like I know it was at E3, but like, there's like off the screen

684
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,400
or like a direct feed B roll stuff out there.

685
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,040
It is, it is Luminous, but Tetris.

686
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,240
It is like the exact same, like the themes and the block change after you get so many

687
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,080
like lines and stuff.

688
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:07,640
And the thing they did to Tetris, they made it so that you can stop time.

689
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,600
And so you can actually get up to 16 clears at one, you can get 16 lines at a time.

690
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,840
Pretty crazy stuff.

691
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,640
The expert Tetris player did.

692
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,640
Yes.

693
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,640
Yeah.

694
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,220
That's the same thing I saw that YouTube out there, which I guess a ton of people have

695
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,220
seen that.

696
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:25,180
Just Google or look on YouTube for Tetris effect expert player or something, and you'll

697
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:29,340
find this video and it has a lot of footage from the game and you can see the expert Tetris

698
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,340
player.

699
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,580
I think they showed like footage of him from like the NES world championships in the nineties

700
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,640
or something.

701
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,820
So he's in his forties now like me and he's like a Tetris master and he was playing that

702
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,820
game.

703
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,040
So, yeah, I'm so excited for Tetris effects, you guys and like Luminous is just like warming

704
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,040
me up to that.

705
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:50,620
Otherwise, I've also been playing a lot of Pokemon Go.

706
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,560
Same kind of deal that Loki was talking about, except, you know, just trying to get all the

707
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
presents I can.

708
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,160
So again, if you're my friend in Pokemon Go and I haven't been sending you enough gifts

709
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,240
or opening your gifts, I am sorry.

710
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,000
Blame Niantic for only letting me open 20 a day.

711
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,840
They should still let you open gifts, even if you only get like a Pokeball or a potion

712
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,920
or just like experience or something like just a little something to let you open all

713
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
your gifts would be great.

714
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,640
At least you can send out unlimited.

715
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,620
But again, trying to try to get that many is a beast.

716
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,820
But I am trying to prioritize people that like I raid with, I trade with that are like

717
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,420
local where I'm going to see those benefits.

718
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:31,480
So sorry about that anyway.

719
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,480
Let's see.

720
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,720
And then there's no shiny Roselia, though, which disappoints me.

721
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,720
I've been trying.

722
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,960
I don't really like that Pokemon in the beginning.

723
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,960
They're like, OK, there's a shiny one out there.

724
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,280
Just like everyone I've seen is like not shiny by not a shiny by.

725
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,220
Well, I guess the reason why they did that is this safari zone event they're doing in

726
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,600
Europe right now, which is kind of like Europe's own community day sort of thing.

727
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,360
I guess it's happening at a rose garden or it's some type of like botanical gardens.

728
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,120
So that's that's why they did Roselia.

729
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
Yes, it makes sense.

730
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,160
I just, you know, I can't evolve it.

731
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:09,080
So it's like, well, I mean, not yet, but it's a Gen Gen four or five has a evolve.

732
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,440
I think it's Gen four.

733
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,800
Gen four has so many like game breaking Pokemon for the current system.

734
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,520
Like this is why we're having to wait a little bit for Gen four, because I think Gen four

735
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,180
is going to require a rebalance of everything.

736
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,800
And so I'm not sure how popular that's going to be.

737
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,980
Act Deft in our chat room points out at live dot vog network dot com.

738
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,380
The go fest shinies are going to be minion and plusle.

739
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,720
So the little the little battery pikachus, you all know which ones those are right.

740
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
Plus minus pikachus.

741
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,960
Yeah, those are the ones that are going to be shiny for Chicago.

742
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,120
But they'll be it'll be worldwide like the Roselia was, but they're so weak.

743
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,700
I know they're not my favorite either.

744
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,040
And I don't think those do evolve.

745
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,440
I don't think those ever go anywhere.

746
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,200
I'd I could be wrong.

747
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,760
Chatters, Pokemon experts, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I've been catching a

748
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,160
lot of those too lately, but it's just like they're so weak.

749
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,680
Yeah, I don't think they go in.

750
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,440
They don't go into the Pikachu chain at all.

751
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,440
They're kind of separate.

752
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,440
So let's see.

753
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,720
S.J. 100 Matt says spots that don't get too much pogo traffic have better odds of getting

754
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,720
shinies.

755
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,720
Interesting.

756
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,380
I thought kind of the friends list was an interesting way to help players in rural areas.

757
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,440
Because you know, if I know people that are in rural areas that don't get to spin pokestops,

758
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,840
imagine getting to open 20 gifts in a day.

759
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,240
Like you're able to get gear, which is nice.

760
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,720
So anyway, other games I've been playing this week still playing Diablo three.

761
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,840
So my seasonal character I mentioned before the last show, I wasn't 70 yet.

762
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,440
So now I'm 70 Paragon 300 plus I hit Paragon 300 earlier today.

763
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,400
So thanks to some of Grandpa from Hoard House or Captain Matt from Starboard Power Coupling.

764
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,040
Thanks to his friends for power leveling.

765
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,180
We were doing like level 75 greater rifts.

766
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:56,680
I gained 64 Paragon levels in one run.

767
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,680
One of those was crazy.

768
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,680
So that was fun.

769
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:03,200
And then I've been playing more Heroes of the Storm again because they suckered me into

770
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,840
watching it on Twitch to get more of the loot chest drops, which in turn made me want to

771
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,320
play Heroes of the Storm more.

772
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,720
So that's that.

773
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,740
Oh, and one more Overwatch.

774
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,680
I actually checked out Overwatch for the first time this week in a long time because of all

775
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,680
the Symmetra rework.

776
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,160
They did a big Symmetra rework.

777
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,600
They announced a new character on the PTR, which I know is coming up later in the show,

778
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,000
which Overwatch fans already know, but we'll talk about that later.

779
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,580
But I wanted to see the Symmetra reworking that they did.

780
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,680
So obviously I wasn't going to get to play her in quick match because people are picking

781
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,360
her like that to get to use her.

782
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,560
But I got to play around in a little test zone.

783
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,880
And then I went into a match as like Moira because I really love playing Moira.

784
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:45,360
She's a great, like kind of fun, like heal and slight damage person.

785
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,840
So yeah, I had a lot of fun playing her and I, I got, I did well enough that I got the

786
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,160
little reputation thingies that are new.

787
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,160
Is that what they're called?

788
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
I don't know.

789
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:01,220
They introduced, I think it's to try to counteract some of the toxicity in Overwatch is instead

790
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,000
of making a negative mark thing, they try to do a positive thing where you can basically

791
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,960
give like commendations to players who are really, really good.

792
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,480
I think that's, I think that's what they call it.

793
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,060
Maybe somebody in chat at live.vognetware.com knows what they really call it, but it's like

794
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,780
extra recognition to, to do a well and beyond.

795
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,780
And it goes on your profile.

796
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,460
Like the more of these you get, the more of these commendations you get, the more you

797
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,700
kind of level up on your profile, which is kind of cool.

798
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,560
So people, people are trying to be nice to get those endorsements.

799
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,560
Thank you.

800
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,560
I knew like, I was like, what were they called?

801
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,560
Yes.

802
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,560
Endorsements.

803
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,560
Thank you.

804
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,560
No, I think that is right.

805
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,120
This is my gaming week.

806
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,120
I've talked plenty enough.

807
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,800
So in this part of the show, I will remind you to check out our Twitter at twitter.com

808
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,620
slash O L R. We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

809
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,560
And that's all the housekeeping I have for you right now.

810
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,540
We will be here over the next few weeks.

811
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:55,620
There's no shows off planned until labor day because labor day weekend, I will be at dragon

812
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,620
con.

813
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:01,400
And if you are in the Southeast area or anywhere remotely near Atlanta, you should be making

814
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,200
plans to attend dragon con as well, because it's a whole lot of fun.

815
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,240
It looks very, very likely I will be doing some panels with the podcasting track.

816
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,680
Very likely there may be more than that this year.

817
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,520
So you'll just stay tuned, really excited at some of the prospects for this year's dragon

818
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,520
con.

819
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,520
So stay tuned for that.

820
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,760
Bobby Black Wolf will be there too.

821
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,320
He's doing a lot of stuff too.

822
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:26,880
And from my understanding is because you guys know a good friend that was here on the last

823
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,880
episode relocated to the East coast.

824
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,320
So extra first now on the East coast, but he only is going to live like six hours from

825
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,320
Atlanta.

826
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,320
So extra for maybe a dragon con this year, I'm trying to try to get him to come.

827
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,880
So we'll we'll see what happens.

828
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,160
I think it'll be fun.

829
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,160
So check that out anyway.

830
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,280
Let's get into some gaming news and some other things that have happened this week, Loki.

831
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:56,480
So you may remember that valve got rid of the API support for that was allowing steam

832
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,620
spy to work.

833
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:04,520
And mainly they had to kind of shut it off because of some of the GDPR European, I guess

834
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:08,080
guidelines for data privacy enforcement.

835
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,160
They had to stay in compliant with that.

836
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,840
And because of that, that's why, you know, all the various profiles are private, so they

837
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,720
can't really scrape that stuff.

838
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:23,280
So now they're basically saying, you know, that they're going to come up with something

839
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,640
to take its place.

840
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,800
That's going to be better.

841
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,880
Their quote, basically, our general approach has been to provide open API so that we don't

842
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:37,800
offer the amount of tools that we are when we don't offer the amount of tools that we

843
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,800
should.

844
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,920
The community can step in, which allows things like steam spy to happen.

845
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,860
However, that had a broad variance in how accurate it was.

846
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:53,400
It was very accurate for some games and inaccurate for a few others.

847
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,500
So they're hoping to fix the issue and create something that's better than steam spy to

848
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,580
replace it.

849
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:05,020
So yes, we're working on new tools and new ways to getting data out of steam.

850
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:09,580
And we hope that data can be more accurate and more useful than what seems by previously

851
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,000
offered.

852
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,620
So that sounds like a good thing.

853
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:17,220
And I guess we'll just wait and see when that happens because we're talking valve time here.

854
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:21,340
So you know, we might count to three.

855
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:26,980
We might be alive when that happens or we might not.

856
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,980
Who knows?

857
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,980
Do they even give a shit?

858
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:34,880
Because I mean, after all, it's just, it's just selling games.

859
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,060
I didn't really buy a whole lot on the steam sale or was that, that was recently wasn't

860
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,060
it?

861
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,060
It's still going.

862
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,060
Yeah.

863
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:46,920
You got, I, I've had, I had some strong words on steam past couple episodes.

864
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,160
So I'm not really jumping at the bit to, to promote their sale, but I understand.

865
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,680
And the reality is, you know, I'm, I bought a game that was very, very cheap.

866
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:04,600
I had to buy it for 4.1 because it was only 20 bucks instead of like 50 what it normally

867
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,600
is.

868
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,960
But I can still be a frustrated customer.

869
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,960
I haven't even looked at it.

870
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,400
I should probably look, there's, yeah, there's a lot of stuff, but people can be pissed.

871
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,360
So also can be pissed at me.

872
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,680
Well, no, well, I'll say this too though.

873
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,640
Keep in mind that usually when these types of sales happen, don't forget to check out

874
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,520
GOG itch IO, the other humble bundle, the other stores too, because they tend to do

875
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,360
response sales, especially around the 4th of July.

876
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:32,600
So, you know, I will say that don't feel like you have to put all your eggs in one basket.

877
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600
Right.

878
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,600
Yeah.

879
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
So, all right.

880
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,160
And I did, I did check the others first, but they were, you know, earth defense forces

881
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,680
only on sale in the scene of store.

882
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,680
So yeah, it happens.

883
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,720
How to bite the bullet there.

884
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,720
All right.

885
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,760
Well, anyway, let's talk about Pokemon go again.

886
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,760
Yeah.

887
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,120
We won't talk about our weeks, but the reality is there's probably a lot of people talking

888
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,840
about Pokemon go right now.

889
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,840
Why?

890
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:00,800
Because it apparently is at its highest player count since the beginning of the game.

891
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,180
So obviously when the game first came out, like fucking everybody was playing it then

892
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:09,320
as some of the server issues and you know, they took away the radars, you know, they

893
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,580
were doing things that made some people kind of over it.

894
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,500
So it dropped way off, but it was far from dead.

895
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,140
It was never a dead game, despite what some sensationalist clickbait headlines would make

896
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,140
you believe.

897
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:25,020
And the reality is it's back from the dead, uh, this week it's doing very well.

898
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,220
This is based on a study from super data.

899
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,880
Apparently the game generated $104 million in may.

900
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,940
I don't know how they, they measure this, but I guess they can see some of the, uh,

901
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,180
the rankings and the different stores and stuff.

902
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,140
They kind of figure it out that way.

903
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:44,380
Um, the long awaited trading feature as well as friend feature.

904
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,720
This is being credited for that whole thing.

905
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,020
So, um, have you done any trading in?

906
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,020
I haven't.

907
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:54,100
No, I should, I should trade you a Pokemon cause if I trade you a Pokemon that I got

908
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:58,660
in Chicago, uh, you'll instantly get your bronze trading metal cause it's over a thousand

909
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,660
kilometers.

910
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,660
Oh yeah.

911
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,660
Kind of fun.

912
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,880
And I can trade you one too, Jamie, if you want.

913
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,340
So anyway, um, the also, uh, a lot of people coming back to Pokemon go because they're

914
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,700
getting ready for let's go Pikachu and Eevee.

915
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,740
I know there were some people that were coming back for that.

916
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,720
Uh, so yeah, the game is doing quite well.

917
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,540
So if you call it a dead game right now, you don't know what you're talking about.

918
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,540
Clearly.

919
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,500
Um, so I mean, props to them for bringing people back.

920
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,900
How long will it stay that high?

921
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,900
We'll see.

922
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,760
I think it'll probably taper off pretty quick again, but they've done a pretty good job

923
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,340
about doing these little things to kind of get people that are curious to pop on back

924
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,340
and check it out.

925
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,340
That's for sure.

926
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,100
So, uh, check that out.

927
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,100
Moving on.

928
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,100
Dark Sakura.

929
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,100
What do you have for us?

930
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:45,140
Uh, just finding out the Dragon Ball Fighter Z for the ultimate edition of 70 bucks on

931
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,140
steam right now.

932
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:52,820
No, but other than that, um, Google is, uh, doing shenanigans.

933
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:58,460
They're basically, well, at least the sources indicate that they are planning a gaming platform

934
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:03,100
to take on Microsoft, to take on Sony, to take on Nintendo.

935
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,220
Um, they want it to be a streaming platform.

936
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:10,600
They're creating hardware for it, and they're already working on bringing in developers

937
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:15,540
under Google, so, uh, they've been putting in some major recruiting and trying to acquire

938
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,180
their company, too.

939
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,180
Other companies.

940
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:25,740
Um, and basically the people who have been talking about this, um, have either been involved

941
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:29,060
in the issue or know people who have been involved in the issue.

942
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:34,980
Um, I mean, and they did try to acquire Twitch before Amazon stepped in, so we had that there.

943
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,260
So they've been thinking about this for a while.

944
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,260
Um.

945
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,840
Thank God that didn't happen.

946
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:44,420
The rumor was going on for a while that they wanted to do something based on Android, but

947
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,760
that didn't happen either.

948
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,100
So they're, they're trying to push through other things.

949
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:54,380
I mean, it's all been rumors before, but this one seems to be, have a lot more weight to

950
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,380
it.

951
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,380
So, we'll see.

952
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,900
How about you support your fucking platforms you already have, like my Android TV that

953
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,060
hardly has any fucking apps on it.

954
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,060
How about that shit?

955
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:09,100
Yeah, I can't help, but when I hear like Google gaming, my mind instantly goes to an Android

956
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,140
console and I go like, oh, so they're going to make an Ouya.

957
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,580
No, it's not going to be an Ouya.

958
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,020
I mean, I, I don't know.

959
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,500
So the streaming platform right now is code named Yeti.

960
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:24,700
Um, so we'll see if there's an accuracy to it.

961
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,620
Yeah, I'm not going to knock it till I've tried it.

962
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,300
You know, let's, let's see what games.

963
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,300
Right.

964
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,300
Right.

965
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,380
Dark Sakura, golden rule of OLR.

966
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,300
It's been a while, it's been a while since we've reminded the listeners about the golden

967
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,300
rule of gaming.

968
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,940
Dark Sakura, would you please, uh, educate the listeners of OLR what the golden rule

969
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:39,940
of gaming is?

970
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,740
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

971
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:42,740
That is correct.

972
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,740
With caveat.

973
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:51,740
It also depends on how well those games play because after having played the same game

974
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:56,100
on multiple consoles, some, some consoles will do it better.

975
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,100
Okay.

976
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,100
Fair enough.

977
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:02,220
In other words, PC is all you need because PC is going to do it lately.

978
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,260
It depends on your setup though.

979
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:09,420
PCs, gaming on PC is expensive and I don't want to get into the console versus PC debate.

980
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,140
I'm just being playful.

981
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,060
Uh, you got to do what works for you at the end of the day.

982
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:18,220
So well, and I came to this conclusion actually watching one of my favorite YouTube channels,

983
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,220
battle of the ports.

984
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:25,660
They talk about games that just look stellar on some consoles and play like shit.

985
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,380
So again, take all that into account.

986
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,380
Yep.

987
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,540
Especially with so much being multi-console in this day and age.

988
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,540
That's for sure.

989
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,540
Exactly.

990
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,540
Exactly.

991
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,540
All righty.

992
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,540
Uh, let's move on.

993
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,540
Loki, what do you have for us?

994
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:42,580
So here's something kind of fun and something we've been asking for for a while.

995
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:47,900
It's like, why these consoles, these modern consoles have USB ports in them.

996
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,220
Why don't they support mouse and keyboard?

997
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,220
Huh?

998
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,500
Why don't they?

999
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,500
No idea.

1000
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:58,420
The controller does if the game does it because you can play a Final Fantasy 14 with keyboard

1001
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,420
and mouse.

1002
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,420
I do it.

1003
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,500
Well, that's nice, but I'm talking about like other games.

1004
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,500
I know.

1005
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,500
I know.

1006
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,260
I, but, but I'm just saying the system can support it, but for whatever reason, a lot

1007
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:13,140
of games like Overwatch won't allow it because Blizzard views that as like tipping the balance

1008
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,220
or I don't know what the fuck their problem is, but that's, you know, they don't, they,

1009
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:20,500
they see that as an advantage over people playing on controller, I guess it's separated

1010
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,500
out.

1011
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,500
I don't know.

1012
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,380
Um, but anyways, Microsoft is actually been working with razor to bring full mouse and

1013
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,100
keyboard support to the Xbox one.

1014
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:36,680
Apparently there's been some leaked documents about a presentation where they've been creating

1015
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:42,980
some different, uh, devices to work with the Xbox one citing, they said that the turret

1016
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:51,420
and black widow devices and, um, even with chroma light up keys and whatnot, funny enough,

1017
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:57,820
I actually just got gaming, uh, a gaming PC and, or not PC, but a keyboard and mouse.

1018
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:03,060
Cause now we have, uh, I set up like a home office thing for my laptop.

1019
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:07,060
So I have a, you know, game of mouse and keyboard now with a, I got a Corsair keyboard and a

1020
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,500
razor mouse.

1021
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:14,000
So now I can try to do some mousey keyboard like everybody else and instead of using controller,

1022
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,700
it's unnatural for me though.

1023
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:19,740
So I don't like it, but I'll try it.

1024
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,500
Um, interesting though.

1025
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,740
It doesn't say any other details like when we might expect this.

1026
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:31,740
Um, but I know they said basically, no Minecraft bedrock edition currently supports mouse and

1027
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:36,860
keyboard and that's, you know, on all these platforms.

1028
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,380
So I guess we'll have to wait and see.

1029
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,360
I would be very curious how many of you are interested in something like this.

1030
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:47,680
I always kind of thought when people want to use mouse and keyboard, they just go to,

1031
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,200
you know, their computer.

1032
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,280
You know, Xbox three 60 also cause final fantasy 11 also used keyboard, right?

1033
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,280
Keyboard.

1034
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,520
I don't know about mouse, but use keyboard.

1035
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,120
So anyway, I mean, I don't know.

1036
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:02,120
Like for more of these like MMO type games, maybe, uh, maybe if you really want to get

1037
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:06,280
competitive like Overwatch or something like that and all you have as a console, you can't

1038
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:11,280
afford, you know, to buy an expensive PC or something, maybe at least you can drop money

1039
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,800
for a keyboard mouse and try to play better that way.

1040
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,800
I don't know.

1041
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,800
All right.

1042
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,640
Let's talk about sexy band games.

1043
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,640
Yay.

1044
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,960
I love sexy band game.

1045
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,960
All right.

1046
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,800
So what is the latest sexy band game?

1047
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,800
It's a game called Omega Labyrinth Z.

1048
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,640
It was a game that was released for the PlayStation four and the PlayStation Vita.

1049
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,400
So you know, I'm talking about Japan cause it was Vita supported.

1050
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,600
Uh, this was a game.

1051
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,360
It's a dungeon crawler, I guess.

1052
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:42,040
But I mean when you look at like the graphics and stuff, it doesn't look like a dungeon

1053
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,040
crawler.

1054
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,720
That is official dungeon crawling garb.

1055
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:53,480
I am sorry, but this, this school girls like F cup boobies are like, they're not just sticking

1056
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,480
out.

1057
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,840
They're sticking out and like going around her jacket.

1058
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,460
That's not an F cup, Rob.

1059
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,120
As one, I can tell you that's not an F cup.

1060
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,120
Oh my God.

1061
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,840
So what cup would that be?

1062
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,400
That would be more like a double Z.

1063
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,040
No, they actually do make double G.

1064
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,000
It's, it's, it's H for hentai.

1065
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Okay.

1066
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,560
It's H it's an H cup.

1067
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,560
H for hentai.

1068
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,560
I like that.

1069
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,560
All right.

1070
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,560
Anyway.

1071
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,040
Uh, so apparently the localization of this game has been refused by Sony, uh, for North

1072
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,560
America and Europe.

1073
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,160
The game was being localized by P cube.

1074
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,680
It's a UK based publisher.

1075
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,200
Uh, and then I guess the localization has been announced.

1076
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,200
It's been canceled.

1077
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,280
Uh, and they put in a little statement over on Twitter.

1078
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,360
Uh, basically they try to do Japanese content for its fans as close to the source material

1079
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,360
as possible.

1080
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:44,440
Uh, P cube try to work with the relevant age rating, uh, bodies and their respective territories,

1081
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,320
and they have to comply with the wishes of the platform holder.

1082
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,460
And so they just withdrew it.

1083
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:55,360
So basically the game was too, too slutty with people that are too young, uh, to be

1084
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,360
released.

1085
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:00,240
Well, I mean, they could have changed the age to everyone.

1086
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:08,120
That sucks that these platforms are just, you know, have no region code, all region

1087
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,120
free anyway.

1088
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,120
I dunno.

1089
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:15,800
Anyway, I guess also, uh, the Britain video standards council refused a box release for

1090
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:21,480
the game in the UK back in March because the player touches certain points on a female

1091
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,400
character's body to arouse them.

1092
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:31,560
A successful action will activate a shame break where parts of their clothing come off,

1093
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,160
revealing more of their bodies.

1094
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,280
Do they have shit like this on the 3DS?

1095
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,040
I don't understand what the problem is.

1096
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:43,500
The player places honey on the girl's bodies, a fantastical dog-like creature that proceeds

1097
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:48,680
to lick the honey off of their bodies, which causes them to become aroused.

1098
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,680
I'm laughing.

1099
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,400
This is so fucking stupid.

1100
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,900
Like the previous mini game, when they reach a certain level of arousal, parts of their

1101
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,580
clothing fall off or vanish.

1102
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:03,880
As the dog licks at the honey, the girls respond with sexualized language.

1103
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:08,740
But of course the main problem is that it takes place in a high school.

1104
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:14,080
And so that means the characters are probably not quite 18 or barely so.

1105
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,720
So where is the labyrinth in like the dungeon crawling with this?

1106
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:22,760
Because so far I'm hearing like there's a dog that's licking a girl.

1107
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:26,680
I mean, where's the dungeon crawling here?

1108
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:30,240
By the way, in some of the screenshots, we see one female character saying to another,

1109
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,320
you there, your skirt is too short, fix it right now.

1110
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:38,520
And another one, a little fairy type creature is saying, eh, well, you have to stroke it

1111
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,920
between your breasts.

1112
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,680
Jamie, would you play this game?

1113
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,680
Maybe.

1114
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:55,960
I just, I think that's ridiculous.

1115
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:01,360
It's God forbid that God forbid we represent, you know, women getting aroused by something,

1116
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,340
but let's just blow some fucking brains and have, have intestines falling out.

1117
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,340
That's okay.

1118
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,340
Here's the thing.

1119
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,340
Here's the thing.

1120
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:09,340
I get the age concern.

1121
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:10,340
I don't want to invalidate that.

1122
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:13,840
It is fucking creepy when it's high school kids at 16, 17.

1123
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:20,840
If upon localization of the game, maybe they could be it's college and they're 20 years

1124
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:25,960
old, you know, it's a little bit like less creepy than maybe, you know, this, some of

1125
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,000
these concerns would probably be eased up a little bit.

1126
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I don't know.

1127
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
It's also a cartoon.

1128
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
They're not alive.

1129
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
They don't have ages anyway.

1130
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I don't know.

1131
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,600
It's more of the connotation of it.

1132
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,200
Yeah, perhaps, perhaps blow those brains away.

1133
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,200
That's fine.

1134
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:47,640
It is ridiculous that people are far more concerned about violence than they are about,

1135
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:57,040
um, I'm sorry, far less concerned about violence than they are about, um, sex or language or

1136
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,440
it's, people are fucking stupid.

1137
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:04,380
But if you want to play a game that oozes sexuality and femininity and is about adults,

1138
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,020
play Bayonetta.

1139
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:10,260
That's why I fucking love Bayonetta because there is room for excessiveness and over the

1140
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,780
topness in video gaming.

1141
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:19,420
Not everything has to be, you know, like a legit story, you know, like a Pulitzer Prize

1142
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:20,980
writing script thing.

1143
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:26,620
Like for in every movie, movie theater and every movie house and things, there's going

1144
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:29,180
to be campy films.

1145
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,300
There's going to be John Waters movies.

1146
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:35,620
There's going to be the types of movies that Elvira watches and mystery science theater

1147
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,360
3000 makes fun of.

1148
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,180
There's a place in art for that type of stuff.

1149
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,940
And that's where Bayonetta kind of fits for me.

1150
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:45,300
Maybe we can get John Waters a telltale series.

1151
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,580
Why hasn't John Waters a telltale game?

1152
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,820
Pink Flamingos, the live adventure.

1153
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:51,820
All right.

1154
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:56,100
Anyway, they should just do a game called the quest for eggs.

1155
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:01,620
Uh, over in our chat, over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, Bobby Black Wolf says, my wife walked

1156
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:07,820
in right when you were describing this, she's wondering what I'm actually listening to.

1157
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:08,820
Come on.

1158
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,820
This isn't that stream.

1159
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:10,820
My bad.

1160
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:11,820
Sorry about that for us.

1161
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:16,820
I mean, she couldn't tell my insanely nasally over the top voice describing this.

1162
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,820
She couldn't tell it was me.

1163
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:23,940
Uh, anyway, uh, dungeon buster says this sounds like a trash game, but to each their own,

1164
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,820
here's the thing though.

1165
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:32,460
Sometimes you want trash, like, can you explain to me why Taco Bell stays in business?

1166
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,860
Because news flash, the food ain't good.

1167
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:38,140
But sometimes you're craving trash.

1168
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:39,140
No, no, no.

1169
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:42,560
You're not craving Mexican food because Taco Bell is not Mexican food.

1170
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:46,340
You're craving trash, right?

1171
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:49,980
I had some friends that went to Waffle House for the first time today.

1172
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,780
I fucking love Waffle House and it's not trash.

1173
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:56,620
Shout out to Extifer and Shane who are on their adventure today.

1174
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,660
Sometimes you're craving trashy diner food.

1175
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,860
Waffle House is not trashy food.

1176
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:01,860
It's delicious.

1177
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:02,860
It's hangover food.

1178
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:03,860
It is not.

1179
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:04,860
I don't know.

1180
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:05,860
I want unlimited waffle right now.

1181
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:09,500
But you always have to order them well done because they do make their waffles a little

1182
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,500
soggy.

1183
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,500
All right.

1184
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,060
Uh, and that's the 100 Matt and Chad says, wake me when a sleep away camp game comes

1185
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,060
out.

1186
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,060
Seriously.

1187
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:20,420
Like if they had a place that would offer, you know how like I have offers like unlimited

1188
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:21,420
pancakes.

1189
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,420
I want unlimited waffles.

1190
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:25,140
We're going to get unlimited waffles.

1191
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:29,100
I how was I hob now?

1192
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,460
No, it's, it's, I hob.

1193
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:33,700
No one goes to your stupid restaurant for burgers.

1194
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,620
Your burgers tastes like shit.

1195
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,860
No one ever goes there.

1196
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,500
Isn't that whole thing just a marketing stunt to get people to talk about it?

1197
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,560
Like they're not actually changing their name.

1198
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,940
I understand that, but like, I think it was a whole stunt to bring out the sassiness of

1199
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:45,940
Wendy's.

1200
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:48,460
But it's like, it's like, Hey, we make pancakes.

1201
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,540
We make some fucking bomb ass pancakes.

1202
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:54,340
Let's focus on these shitty ass fucking hamburgers that we make.

1203
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,940
Why would you do that?

1204
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:00,100
Why did you focus on the breakfast food?

1205
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,100
It's good.

1206
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,460
Your hamburgers not so much.

1207
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:10,580
Because the problem is most of the I hops in America die between the hours of 1 PM and

1208
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:16,260
midnight because, well, I mean, once the bars are let out, then they start filling up again.

1209
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:17,340
Cause people are like, Oh, I'm drunk.

1210
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,340
I want pancakes.

1211
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:22,420
If I'm going during dinner time, I'm getting fucking pancakes because it's an I hop.

1212
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,980
I'm not going there for fucking hamburgers.

1213
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:28,740
If I want a hammer, I'll go to a million other places that are better than them, including

1214
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,140
McDonald's and McDonald's.

1215
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:32,460
Isn't even the food.

1216
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,740
Speaking of sometimes you crave trash.

1217
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:38,220
I never, I, do you know what they put in chicken nuggets?

1218
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,220
Trash.

1219
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,420
They're so fucking delicious.

1220
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:44,760
I know, but it is just as I thought trash.

1221
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,620
Their hamburgers though are not so great, but they are better than the I hops hamburgers.

1222
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:54,460
Hey, when you're dead broke, you know, dollar hamburger works.

1223
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:58,820
Tiger claw on chat says, do you know anyone that eats pancakes for lunch or dinner?

1224
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,660
Um, yeah, I'm raising my hand.

1225
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:03,260
I'm raising them both.

1226
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:05,340
Breakfast for dinner is bomb.

1227
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:06,340
Like yeah, it is.

1228
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:10,420
I mean, you know what, O L R official challenge.

1229
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:14,660
I want everyone, including the hosts, I want everyone this week, once this week to have

1230
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:18,460
breakfast for dinner and send us your snaps at O L R over on Twitter.

1231
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,140
I do this shit without a challenge.

1232
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,620
I make, I make scram.

1233
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,500
I make omurice at night.

1234
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,200
You know what omurice is, right?

1235
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,500
It's the omelet over rice.

1236
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,780
I don't make it with ketchup cause ketchup is disgusting.

1237
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,860
But I make omurice like regularly.

1238
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,300
You don't, you don't have to go to I hop.

1239
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,520
This is not a commercial for I hop.

1240
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,500
You can, you can make your own damn pancakes.

1241
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:41,580
Get out the bisque quick and make your own damn pancakes and fucking bisque quick.

1242
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:48,020
I have the Birch benders pancake mix, which is delicious and craisins because it goes

1243
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:50,720
amazing in their pancakes and chocolate chips.

1244
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,300
And if you want to waffle, have a waffle.

1245
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,300
Make that waffle bitch.

1246
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,060
We got rid of our waffle irons.

1247
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,060
I need a waffle iron.

1248
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:59,060
Oh my God.

1249
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,140
Why would you get rid of waffle irons and not give it to me?

1250
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:03,300
My wife didn't like them.

1251
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,180
Do you want to borrow our Hello Kitty waffle maker?

1252
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,180
No, it's, it's cool.

1253
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:08,260
I don't need the waffles like that.

1254
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:13,260
I mean, I might be able to make it work if I put it in cause you know I have a Hello

1255
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,260
Kitty.

1256
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,940
I have like one of those, like it's not a George form.

1257
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:16,940
It's a panini press.

1258
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:21,420
Maybe if I put enough batter in there, that might make a weird looking like crinkle cup

1259
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:22,420
waffle or something.

1260
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:27,320
Well, actually the Foreman grills have a waffle tray.

1261
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,820
That's how Alan makes waffles.

1262
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,580
The nicer ones.

1263
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:31,580
Yeah.

1264
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:32,580
Yeah.

1265
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,580
Oh, well we have a nice Foreman grills.

1266
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:34,580
Rob, can I borrow your waffle maker?

1267
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:35,580
Yeah.

1268
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,300
Cause I think my pancake batter works for waffles.

1269
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,300
Oh yeah.

1270
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,300
Work.

1271
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,300
Cool.

1272
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,300
All right.

1273
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,820
And my work, to be honest though, my work on our cafe, we have self-serve waffles.

1274
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:46,180
I wonder if I can make like, put my protein powder in it, make protein waffles.

1275
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:49,620
Speaking of breakfast, let's talk about eggs, dark Sakura.

1276
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:50,620
Eggman.

1277
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:53,780
Eggs, eggs, it's the Eggman.

1278
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,100
I love my eggs.

1279
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,700
I love the Eggman.

1280
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:01,340
The sad thing is there's probably like two OLR listeners that will understand that reference

1281
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:03,220
whatsoever.

1282
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:04,220
You know, I know that reference.

1283
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:06,220
I've never seen the movie all the way through.

1284
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:10,740
It's a Pink Flamingos reference for those who don't know, which I just, I feel the need.

1285
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:11,740
Isn't it Edith?

1286
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:15,380
Yeah, it's Edith Massey's character that she's like this old lady that sits in a crib the

1287
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:16,380
whole movie.

1288
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:17,380
And she loves eggs.

1289
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:18,380
Yeah.

1290
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:19,380
She loves the Eggman.

1291
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:20,380
She gets excited when she visits.

1292
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:21,780
See, you guys just don't understand.

1293
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:22,780
You don't understand.

1294
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:23,780
You do need the watch.

1295
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,460
So seriously though, if you, they did this wonderful thing.

1296
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:30,460
I watch a lot of this channel, Red Letter Media.

1297
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:37,280
They did a retrospective on Pink Flamingos and they really do go break down all the details

1298
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,280
of the movie.

1299
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,280
So you got to totally watch it because it's awesome.

1300
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,780
So it's like Game Theory, but for Pink Flamingos.

1301
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:46,060
More like Gaming Historian than like for Pink Flamingos.

1302
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:49,540
But they're filmmakers, so they go into like different techniques and they even go like,

1303
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,540
what techniques?

1304
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:53,180
Well, they talk about like how they feel different.

1305
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:54,180
What techniques?

1306
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,900
I don't know.

1307
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:59,900
John Waters movies do have some very interesting film techniques, especially for the lower

1308
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:00,900
budget stuff.

1309
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:04,900
Cause you have to, when you have no budget like that, but then again, you want to see

1310
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:08,260
some interesting cinematography, fucking watch Cry Baby.

1311
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:11,220
MXC in chat says, Edith Massey for life.

1312
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,100
I love her in Desperate Living.

1313
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,100
Okay.

1314
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,920
You got points for me for referencing Desperate Living because I mean, you have a hard enough

1315
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:22,060
time finding people who've actually seen Pink Flamingos, then try to see who's seen Desperate

1316
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:25,940
Living because that was like the one John Waters movie that Divine wasn't in.

1317
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:29,180
And so it's like even less people have seen that somehow, but that movie is incredible.

1318
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,180
Anyway.

1319
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,180
I fucking love Divine.

1320
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,180
Anyway.

1321
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,180
Sorry.

1322
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,180
Eggs.

1323
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:35,180
Okay.

1324
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:37,580
So, and I'm sure everyone knows this cause I've seen it all the fuck over Facebook, but

1325
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,620
I figured it had to be mentioned.

1326
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:48,660
Jim Carrey has been in negotiations with Paramount to play Eggman as in Dr Robotnik from Sonic

1327
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:49,740
the Hedgehog.

1328
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:54,700
And yes, the Sonic the Hedgehog movie is going to be a combination of live action CG.

1329
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:58,500
It sounds like a fucking train wreck, but we'll see.

1330
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:06,300
It has James Marsden in it and Tika Sumpter being directed by Jeff Fowler.

1331
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,460
We'll fucking see.

1332
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:11,220
I mean, I guess he could play a pretty good Eggman.

1333
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:16,020
I kind of see him being able to just given the range of comedic roles that he's played

1334
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:20,260
and he would definitely play a funny kind of evil.

1335
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:28,780
So it makes sense to me, but at the same time, I'm just still kind of like, I'm down.

1336
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:32,340
I'm down for any train wreck starring Jim Carrey.

1337
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,340
You're a big Jim Carrey fan.

1338
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,420
I am a big Jim Carrey fan.

1339
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:35,560
I'll watch anything that he's in.

1340
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,540
That's where Loki comes from.

1341
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:41,900
Sometimes people think it's the Marvel character, but you actually got your name for the mask.

1342
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:42,900
Yeah.

1343
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,900
So it's kind of funny.

1344
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:53,380
I was thinking Norse God, you know, before not referencing Marvel, but nope, Jim Carrey.

1345
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:54,380
Anyway.

1346
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:56,260
No, I'll check it out.

1347
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:57,260
Why not?

1348
01:00:57,260 --> 01:01:01,020
I I'm with some of the chatters that are like, let's see a trailer.

1349
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:04,820
Let's let's let's see some footage before we come to a conclusion on that.

1350
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:05,820
Yeah.

1351
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:07,300
I don't know how I feel.

1352
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:11,820
I want to know where they're going to get the Mario and Luigi voices from for the Mario

1353
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:16,700
Brothers movie that they're doing over on the others that the people that did Despicable

1354
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,180
Me are doing that that Mario movie, right?

1355
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:23,020
Because that's why we're getting Mario Land at Universal Studios are going to do a movie

1356
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:24,020
as well.

1357
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,020
So I'm kind of curious.

1358
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:26,020
We'll see.

1359
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:27,020
We'll see.

1360
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:30,060
Actually, speaking of Mario movies, have you ever seen the anime that came out in the 80s

1361
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,540
where Luigi has like the blue and yellow outfit?

1362
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:33,540
I don't think I have.

1363
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:36,300
The whole fucking thing is on YouTube and it's bad.

1364
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,380
It is not good, but it's hilarious.

1365
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:40,860
Yeah, I'm good with hilariously bad.

1366
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:41,900
All right.

1367
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:45,660
Just a few more stories before we get into the hilariously awesome classic peripheral

1368
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,660
of the month.

1369
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:47,660
Loki.

1370
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:48,660
Yes.

1371
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:52,820
So my kids are bugging me again today when we went to the GameStop to look at what we

1372
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:57,100
just killed time before we went grocery shopping, but they wanted to buy Labo stuff.

1373
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:00,300
And I said, no, because it's 80 dollars and fuck that shit.

1374
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,620
And they said and they're like, why?

1375
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:05,340
I'm like, well, you're going to break it and it's going to be all over the house and that's

1376
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:06,660
why you can't have it.

1377
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,660
But this is something interesting, though.

1378
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:14,660
So if you like arcade games, you can get your own arcade cabinet that's cardboard for the

1379
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:15,660
Nintendo Switch.

1380
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:17,300
It's only 20 bucks.

1381
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:21,640
It's coming out November 27th, coming out from a Nyko.

1382
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,940
And it's this cute little cabinet that you can put your joy cons in.

1383
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:32,260
They even have little like joystick add ons for your analog sticks.

1384
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:35,740
And yeah, it looks like you can customize it.

1385
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:37,580
They have sticker sheets with pixels on them.

1386
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:43,780
They can make pixel art. It's 20 dollars way better than 80 dollars.

1387
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:45,260
So that's good.

1388
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:48,620
I like that they're kind of branching out and doing more stuff with Labo.

1389
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:52,140
Yeah, definitely. Well, I mean, yeah, absolutely.

1390
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,640
So and this is kind of neat, too.

1391
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,300
Now, this is something else for like arcade fans, too.

1392
01:02:56,300 --> 01:03:01,580
You may remember that they're getting a lot of different games that have vertical screen

1393
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:07,560
support. So like Ikaruga, for example, the arcade archives Donkey Kong.

1394
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:12,360
Was another thing. So now there's this Kickstarter for an accessory for the switch called the

1395
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:19,960
Flip Grip, and the Flip Grip allows you to actually put the screen in a vertical orientation

1396
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,920
and be able to snap the joy cons in there as well.

1397
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:27,840
So you can play vertical games without having to balance the screen really funky in order

1398
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,640
to actually make that happen.

1399
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,640
So that's pretty cool.

1400
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:38,000
Basically, it says right now the let's see what they've got left on it.

1401
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,720
So they had quite a bit to go in the campaign.

1402
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:46,760
And I think I think you didn't have the pledge too much to actually get one of these.

1403
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:51,120
So there's still no, actually, they've hit their goal.

1404
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,800
So they had seven days to go right now.

1405
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:56,920
There are one hundred and nine thousand of forty two thousand dollars, so they've made it

1406
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:00,680
there. If you want one of these flip grips, you can pay twelve bucks.

1407
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:06,920
And they're estimated they're going to deliver those on sometime in 2018.

1408
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:10,600
Looks like November. So neat.

1409
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:16,280
All right, well, if all that expansion in the Labo universe and associated universe wasn't

1410
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,480
enough, guess what?

1411
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:22,320
Now, Nintendo Labo products can be used with actual switch games.

1412
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:27,760
Yeah, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was patched this week to be compatible with Nintendo Labo.

1413
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:34,080
So you can actually use the little like motorcycle type of little thing that you can make

1414
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,480
out of the Labo little motorcycle head.

1415
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:40,000
You can now use that as like an official controller type in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

1416
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,560
So because Mario Kart also lets you do motorcycles, some people forget it's not just

1417
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,360
karts, but you can do motorcycles in that game.

1418
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,080
So it's it's pretty legit.

1419
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:52,720
So, yeah, motion controls, cardboard button presses, all of that will work.

1420
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:53,920
So that's kind of fun.

1421
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,920
So you can do that. And Nintendo says it's not going to stop there.

1422
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,720
Nintendo has said there will be more.

1423
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,720
It is the first game outside of Nintendo Labo to receive Toy-Con support.

1424
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,280
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is.

1425
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:10,200
More titles will be compatible with Nintendo Labo in the future.

1426
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,640
Please look forward to it.

1427
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:14,880
Neat. Yeah, kind of neat.

1428
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,640
I mean, I don't want to fill my house up with all this fucking cardboard, but I like that

1429
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,040
there's, you know, options.

1430
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:23,080
And who knows, maybe something will be really compelling where I've got to try it.

1431
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:29,000
I'm wondering if it will be possible to laminate all that cardboard or to seal it with

1432
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,040
like some sort of resin.

1433
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,120
Maybe that would give it some sort of permanence.

1434
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:38,840
How about a music game that actually uses that piano keyboard mania on the switch?

1435
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:42,640
There was someone that was actually an indie game that was doing that.

1436
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,880
Oh, cool. So I don't know.

1437
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,920
That would be awesome. I would love that.

1438
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,720
So. All right.

1439
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,600
And JD in chat says, I wish I could buy the piano separately.

1440
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,920
You know, if they start releasing stuff like that, maybe you will be able to maybe you'll be

1441
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,400
able to buy the motorcycle stuff separately.

1442
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,360
I mean, this is where Labo's at now.

1443
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:59,880
Like half the price.

1444
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:02,040
I mean, it just honestly is really expensive.

1445
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,320
I'm kind of surprised Nintendo isn't putting out a little more for the holidays.

1446
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,360
Fucking cardboard.

1447
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,760
Like I get the game took some development and everything.

1448
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,320
But dude, come on.

1449
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,680
It's fucking cardboard.

1450
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:15,680
Now, here we are back to the debate from several weeks and actually to to your point.

1451
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:20,320
No, no. To the point, though, if you are looking for just the piano or something like that

1452
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:24,400
and you can find a used copy of the game, you could do that, because remember, they do

1453
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,520
sell each of the pieces separately.

1454
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:27,880
You can buy the replacement parts.

1455
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,400
I just don't know if you can find it.

1456
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,360
Use. All right.

1457
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:37,400
Well, let's move on and talk about let's talk about an old school peripheral.

1458
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:41,280
You know, back when everything back when your peripherals were not made out of cardboard,

1459
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,000
they were made out of other stuff.

1460
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,880
It's the classic game of the week.

1461
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:49,560
And every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

1462
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:55,840
hey, you little brats, you should be checking this out or you can just go kick rocks.

1463
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:00,800
Anyway, once a month, Dark Sakura does the classic peripheral of the month.

1464
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:05,960
Since we weren't here last week, which would have been the end of June, Dark Sakura's behind

1465
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:09,680
on the peripherals. So tonight is actually June's peripheral.

1466
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:14,360
Yes, I know it's July 1st, but we're just going to ask you to deal with it.

1467
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:19,520
So Dark Sakura, what is the classic peripheral of the month?

1468
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:23,920
I chose the Rez trans vibrator.

1469
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,200
Which great pick.

1470
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:36,680
And contrary to popular parody, the trans vibrator was really not intended to be a sex

1471
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,560
toy. Sorry, kids.

1472
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:43,880
Even though Screw Attack ranked it as the number one best gaming peripheral because of

1473
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,120
that reason. There was a whole article about it.

1474
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,240
It was actually pretty funny.

1475
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:54,920
But anyway, one of the points for Rez was to bring about the sense of synesthesia.

1476
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:59,520
And if no one if you don't know what synesthesia is, it actually is something that

1477
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:03,760
people like me who have autism or are autistic experience.

1478
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,560
Not everyone does, but some of us do.

1479
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:13,680
It's where one set of sensations trigger another section, almost like, for example,

1480
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,440
people who say they can taste colors.

1481
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:25,680
The theory is that their receptors in their brain that that process color goes through

1482
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,680
their their taste sensation area as well.

1483
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:36,000
Is that similar to that ASMR stuff where like you kind of hear somebody like, you know,

1484
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:41,760
playing with the lady eating the pickles really slowly in the video, right in the

1485
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:44,840
microphone, right? That whole like people like feel the tingles in their neck.

1486
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:45,720
Is that similar to that?

1487
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:50,080
It's similar, but not quite like there's a type of synesthesia.

1488
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:54,520
I was actually watching a thing about it where I got this one particular person

1489
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,560
perceives numbers as patterns.

1490
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,360
So it actually triggers like a pattern sense.

1491
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:02,280
You know how people can usually pick up patterns and things.

1492
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:08,640
It triggers a pattern sense and he can do almost any math, thinkable without having

1493
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,800
any background training or any advanced mathematics studies just by paying attention

1494
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,200
to the patterns that form in his brain.

1495
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,560
He can recite pie practically to infinity.

1496
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:22,880
He did it to like, I want to say, a hundred points was pretty crazy.

1497
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,040
Now, me, I do have synesthesia myself.

1498
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:33,080
For me, it triggers anything that has to do with writing, reading and sound.

1499
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:37,080
Anything that has to do with that all goes through my spatial awareness myself.

1500
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:41,360
So I get a sense of architecture with things that I read or things that I listen to.

1501
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:46,000
That's why I can't listen to some things because it will just make me feel like I'm

1502
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,640
claustrophobic. Seriously.

1503
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:55,720
So back to the trans vibrator, it is it's supposed to add to this experience of

1504
01:09:55,720 --> 01:10:01,160
synesthesia where you have this device that provides haptic feedback.

1505
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:06,760
It's one of it's an early experiment, I'd say, into, you know, more recent technology

1506
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:07,840
that uses haptic feedback.

1507
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,600
I mean, our Apple watches Rob haptic feedback.

1508
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:20,360
So at any rate, it was requested by Mizuguchi when he was designing the game and

1509
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:23,760
wanting to do he was actually going through the arcade division that they wanted

1510
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,800
cockpit chairs that would vibrate in time with the music.

1511
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,760
And even though that didn't come about, he wanted to also use the DualShock controller

1512
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,640
for haptic feedback in rez as well.

1513
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,920
But it wasn't strong enough.

1514
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:42,000
So he went to ASCII to design a peripheral that would function like the DualShock to

1515
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,440
be stronger. And so in the special package version of the PlayStation 2 release of

1516
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:52,080
rez included a USB haptic feedback called a device called a trans vibrator, which is

1517
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,400
about a mouse sized peripheral that pulses in time with music.

1518
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:00,920
And it was designed to either be held or put in a pocket or some people would sit on it.

1519
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,720
You know, it had a pouch on it and the pouch could be cleaned, by the way.

1520
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:10,080
So it meant to be hygienic, but you could get a closer sense of synesthesia.

1521
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:16,120
It wasn't true synesthesia, but it engaged another sense to go along with the playing

1522
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:17,360
and interacting with the game.

1523
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:23,240
You know, and again, people will almost turn anything into something sexual because of

1524
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:27,440
course they will. And so there were all the parodies around the game with that.

1525
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:28,960
Like putting it in your vagina.

1526
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,680
Yeah, but not.

1527
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:36,440
At any rate, it also is compatible, though, with two other games.

1528
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:41,800
One of them is with Space Channel 5 Part 2 and another with the Japanese version of

1529
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,240
Disaster Report.

1530
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:49,680
They did do some aftermarket versions.

1531
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:52,040
Well, you can still buy them on aftermarket retailers.

1532
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:55,400
There are some third party versions of the same thing.

1533
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:58,960
They go for about 60 bucks, depending on where you find it.

1534
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,120
They also did reverse engineer the trans vibrators.

1535
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:08,960
So now they have PC drivers out for it so that you can now it was for Windows XP and

1536
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:12,600
Windows 2000, but I'm sure that other people have updated those drivers for current

1537
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:19,800
systems. And on top of that, a guy named Sam Hocovar, if I pronounced that right, wrote

1538
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,080
a driver for the Linux kernel.

1539
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:26,240
So now it works for Linux, which makes me think that we would be able to have there's

1540
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:31,280
got to be Mac drivers for it, too, because, I mean, they're both Unix, so whatever.

1541
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:40,520
And then while the trans vibrator never had any other kind of re-release and they made

1542
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:46,080
a nod to it in Res HD, where you can use up to three additional controllers to add that

1543
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,440
trans vibration function back into the game.

1544
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:53,520
And I know I've been trying to avoid peripherals that are used for very specific

1545
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,040
purposes, even though I've done the twin sticks, because other games will use the twin

1546
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:04,720
sticks. But this one is so iconic because it really is because, first of all, the major

1547
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:08,440
demand for it that was out at the time and even now people still go for it.

1548
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:13,160
I mean, I wouldn't mind it's one thing I don't have in my collection, but there are

1549
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:18,640
people, you know, who just immediately think of that need to either think of the screw

1550
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:24,720
check joke, lol, haha, dildo, or, you know, think of it in terms of that collecting thing.

1551
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:27,920
And there's usually general, oh, I remember that.

1552
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,320
Not that.

1553
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:34,680
Yeah, so I think it's worthy enough to be on the peripheral of the list.

1554
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,760
And I like that they've tried to emulate it since then, like when they did Res on the

1555
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,000
360, like the controller would kind of vibrate and you could.

1556
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Yeah, you put the extra controllers and I guess some people are talking about how

1557
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,280
Luminous Remastered kind of does something with it on the Switch.

1558
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,520
It really does set a precedence for that because now, I mean, well, if you think about

1559
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:55,000
it too, we were already sort of having things like this in theaters, like with Captain

1560
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,120
Neo, remember?

1561
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:56,880
Oh, yeah.

1562
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,800
You'd feel the music through your chair.

1563
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,240
40.

1564
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,160
Right.

1565
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:04,600
And there's been a concept that's been around for a while, but we never really had anything

1566
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:08,600
like that incorporated into our games pretty much until this game.

1567
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:09,320
Yeah.

1568
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,920
I mean, there were others that tried.

1569
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:15,280
I mean, there was also like Sega on the Saturn.

1570
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:20,280
There were some fucking weird ass games, like the ones where it was all meant to be played

1571
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:21,120
without the screen.

1572
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:26,000
You played it by sound or the one that like grows your flowers, grow seeds while you're

1573
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:26,800
playing the damn game.

1574
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,080
You know, weird stuff like that, that tried to engage other things.

1575
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:35,680
But this was really the one that really brought that sensory feedback into, I think, modern

1576
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,080
gaming.

1577
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:37,920
All right.

1578
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:38,400
There it is.

1579
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,800
Your classic peripheral of the month, the Res trans vibrator.

1580
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,720
The dildo.

1581
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,760
Whatever.

1582
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,560
We're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, guys.

1583
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:52,640
We've got plenty more OLR to come, including your emails, some rapid fire news and your

1584
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:58,480
calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype and more gaming news, including a

1585
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:05,520
story about the latest going ons in the PUBG legal drama and some changes in the next Mega

1586
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,120
Man collection, the Mega Man X collection.

1587
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:11,280
We'll talk all about all of that when we come back after this break with more of Orange

1588
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:11,920
Lounge Radio.

1589
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:12,400
Stay tuned.

1590
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:25,120
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live, episode number 736 in progress

1591
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,440
for this July 1st of 2018.

1592
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:32,080
And as we said at the top of the show, happy Canada Day to all of our friends up north.

1593
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,360
Hope you guys had a good day.

1594
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:37,760
And I know this week would be the 4th of July for those of us down here in the States.

1595
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,240
A nice day off of work.

1596
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:45,040
I don't know if you guys have anything fun planned or if you're going to set off fireworks

1597
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,480
or as my mom used to call it, you might as well just set the money on fire.

1598
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:51,360
It's just as effective as those safe and sane fireworks are.

1599
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,200
Loki, you seem like a fireworks kind of guy.

1600
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,880
Are you going to buy some fireworks and set them off?

1601
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,160
No, I'm too smart to not buy those fireworks anymore.

1602
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,400
Those lame safe and they're just garbage.

1603
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,400
Yeah, it's just you might as well forget it.

1604
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,960
Jamie, you and Dan used to buy some and set them off.

1605
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,000
Are you doing that this year?

1606
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,640
No, because I have to go to bed at 8 o'clock because I have to work at 5 a.m.

1607
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:09,200
the next day.

1608
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,440
Yeah, so I'm going to be using my noise canceling earplugs.

1609
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,000
There you go.

1610
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:20,000
And my light canceling eye mask and to cancel the world out.

1611
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
And furthermore, with the current state of this country,

1612
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,760
I don't think there's anything we're celebrating.

1613
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:24,640
So fuck it.

1614
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,160
Yeah, nothing to celebrate.

1615
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,960
We have now completely turned away from what this country was founded to be.

1616
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:29,520
So fuck them.

1617
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:33,200
We should celebrate everybody who registers to vote.

1618
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,880
That's what we should be celebrating.

1619
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:41,840
So, yes, if you live in the United States and you also are completely disgusted with

1620
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,960
what's going on, don't just sit on your ass and fucking complain about it.

1621
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,640
Register the fuck to vote.

1622
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:53,920
And if you have registered to vote, I would like to see you go in and actually vote besides that,

1623
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:54,560
too.

1624
01:16:54,560 --> 01:17:00,560
But go on, go on, go on Twitter and just post.

1625
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:01,520
OLR says vote.

1626
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:03,760
All right.

1627
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:04,480
Make a tag of it.

1628
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:05,360
OLR says vote.

1629
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:06,480
All right.

1630
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:07,520
I'll be looking for you.

1631
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:08,480
OLR says...

1632
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:14,000
I might even send you a Pride edition Cards Against Humanity glitter pack.

1633
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:14,480
Oh, God.

1634
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,360
Did you get the ones with glitter in it?

1635
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,560
I bought five of them.

1636
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,440
I love it.

1637
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:17,680
All right.

1638
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:18,400
Let's get into it.

1639
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,560
OLR says it's time for rapid fire news.

1640
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,040
Or, oh, as Bobby Blackwolf says in Chad and Old Slogan,

1641
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,200
vote or P Diddy will kill you.

1642
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,680
Vote or D Se will kill you.

1643
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:33,600
Anyway, I actually realized Dark Sakura has the same initials as a 3DS.

1644
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,760
Anyway, so up to your interpretation, if a Nintendo system will kill you or if Dark Sakura

1645
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:38,320
will.

1646
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,720
Anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news.

1647
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:41,520
I'm sneakier.

1648
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:44,640
Loki, it's that time of the year.

1649
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:49,440
It's the beginning of a new month, which means there's more new free games you get for paying

1650
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,560
for online.

1651
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:58,080
So starting with PlayStation Plus, in July, we're getting Heavy Rain and Absolver on

1652
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,280
PlayStation 4.

1653
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:05,200
PlayStation 3 is getting Raymond 3 HD and Deception 4, the Nightmare Princess.

1654
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:10,160
And on the Vita, Space Overlords and Zero Escape, Zero Time Dilemma.

1655
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,320
So that's pretty awesome.

1656
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,720
I don't know if there's any other cross play.

1657
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:16,560
Don't see any.

1658
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,720
So we'll have to take it from there.

1659
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:27,440
And then, of course, on the Microsoft side of things, for the Xbox One, for the whole

1660
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,960
month of July, you'll be getting Assault Android Cactus for free.

1661
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:35,440
And then from the second half or from the halfway point in July through the halfway

1662
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:39,120
point in August, Death Squared will be free.

1663
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:45,520
And then as part of the Xbox 360 and also compatible with Xbox One, Virtua Fighter 5,

1664
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:50,240
the final showdown is going to be coming July 1st through the 15th and Tom Clancy's

1665
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:54,720
Splinter Cell Conviction for the second half of July.

1666
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:57,120
All right.

1667
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:04,480
And then, in case you're living under a rock, there is a new Overwatch character and it

1668
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:09,680
is a hamster in a giant ball that's a death machine.

1669
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:16,800
So Hammond or Wrecking Ball, I guess, is going to be the character's name, is the new

1670
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,800
tank character in the game.

1671
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,240
And he shoots stuff.

1672
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:22,640
He rolls around in a ball, has a grappling hook.

1673
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,640
It's all the things that you want in a robot hamster.

1674
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:25,860
Ball.

1675
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:27,600
And I'm down.

1676
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,480
It looks awesome.

1677
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:33,440
I fucking love Hammond or as they call it, Wrecking Balls, the actual game by Hammond.

1678
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,640
The little cam.

1679
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:35,440
Little ham.

1680
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,080
Hamtaro.

1681
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:36,720
I love it.

1682
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,320
So, yeah, super cute.

1683
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:42,240
I love what people are doing on Twitch, too, with like the races and things like that.

1684
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:45,040
Like they're racing the little balls on the map.

1685
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:45,920
It's adorable.

1686
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,800
I've saw some where there's people just spinning around stuff.

1687
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:49,760
Why wouldn't you?

1688
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:50,260
Yeah.

1689
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:58,000
So I haven't played the public test realm yet for this new character, but yeah, it's

1690
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,600
going to be interesting.

1691
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,320
I can't wait to try it.

1692
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:05,520
Did you see the Overwatch cartoon that someone made where the cat has a mecha?

1693
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,020
No.

1694
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:07,520
It was pretty funny.

1695
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,040
I found it on Facebook.

1696
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:12,640
There was, you know, I remember Blizzard from one of their panels from an old Blizzcon or

1697
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:16,320
something showed all these Overwatch characters that didn't make the cut because they brainstormed

1698
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:19,280
a ton because there was one based off of that one.

1699
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,560
I don't remember the name of the movie.

1700
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,240
It's one of those kung fu movies and it has the older lady with the curlers in her hair.

1701
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,280
Oh, Kung Fu Hustle.

1702
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:25,520
Yeah.

1703
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,240
Was that it?

1704
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,800
And so, um, like she, like they had a character.

1705
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:33,760
It was basically her that they cut, unfortunately, but they also had jetpack cat.

1706
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:34,400
That's awesome.

1707
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,640
So it's like, okay, if fucking.

1708
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:42,240
I say we need to go full on, you know, crazy.

1709
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:46,880
Just all of this shit that you'd said, nah, nah, it's, it's too crazy.

1710
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,080
No, bring it all back.

1711
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:48,480
That's right.

1712
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,640
We need to make this president cat level.

1713
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,120
That's right.

1714
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,120
Canvassing president jet pack cat.

1715
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:57,200
All right.

1716
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:01,600
If somebody at Blizzard really loves me, they'll make that president jet pack cat or he's got

1717
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:02,720
to be the president or something.

1718
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,560
Anyway, uh, let's move on.

1719
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,800
So, uh, one of the reasons I was out last week is again, I was in Chicago and I was

1720
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,160
going to pride in Chicago, just like dark soccer was at San Francisco pride.

1721
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:12,880
I marched in pride.

1722
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:13,200
Yes.

1723
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:13,840
It was amazing.

1724
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:18,160
Well, sadly, the pride event we weren't at was Seattle, but to be fair, there were lots

1725
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:22,000
of pride events all around the country last week and, um, throughout the month of June

1726
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,880
and some have them a different time of the year, just depending on what's going on in

1727
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:25,680
your town.

1728
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:29,600
But the reason why I bring it up and yes, it is video game related because at the Seattle

1729
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:34,880
pride parade, Nintendo actually marched in the parade as did Niantic.

1730
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:36,800
Nintendo actually had these stickers.

1731
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,480
They were given away that said, play it proud.

1732
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,000
And they had little rainbows on them.

1733
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,920
Uh, the, the employees are giving out the sticker and I think that's a really cool.

1734
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,920
Um, so we actually saw some tweets out there from some of the employees in Nintendo, including

1735
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,760
Jose Otero and Bill Trennan.

1736
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,360
So, um, yeah, that's really cool.

1737
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,240
I wish I could have seen that, but I bet some of you in Seattle did.

1738
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:58,960
And, uh, you know, I know that the whole like corporations with rainbow logos and kind of

1739
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,400
jumping in on pride month.

1740
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:03,520
I know it's a little bit controversial because some people kind of feel like, Oh, they just

1741
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,680
show up for pride month and try to get the gay dollars.

1742
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:06,320
Then they run away.

1743
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:06,800
But you know what?

1744
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:10,880
I remember a time when nobody wanted to touch these issues.

1745
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:16,800
So I mean, it kind of warms my heart in many ways to see like Nintendo with rainbow flags

1746
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,480
and employees like marching in the parade.

1747
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:19,280
Cause that's awesome.

1748
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:24,880
Cause you know, I remember a time in my life when I turned to video games because I kind

1749
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,400
of didn't think there was anything else.

1750
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:30,000
So, you know, let's have a moment here.

1751
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:30,640
All right.

1752
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:35,680
Anyway, uh, moving from a serious topic like that to a less serious topic, but apparently

1753
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:37,360
very serious for some people.

1754
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:41,200
And that would be the exclusion of Waluigi from Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

1755
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,800
Or, uh, he's a, uh, a support character, I suppose.

1756
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:51,440
Apparently Reggie Fils-Aime has been asked about it in an interview with Vice.

1757
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:54,480
Jesus Christ, this is the level of fuckery we've gotten to.

1758
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:59,520
And, uh, Reggie Fils-Aime said, clearly Nintendo does not hate Waluigi.

1759
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:03,920
I look, Reggie is on record.

1760
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,800
You guys, Nintendo does not hate Waluigi.

1761
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:07,680
Stop it.

1762
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:10,880
They have to like, they have to add more characters as it goes along.

1763
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:14,000
I mean, this isn't the full roster that they announced, obviously.

1764
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:20,000
But basically he's pushed it off on Sakurai because it's his game saying Mr.

1765
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,080
Sakurai will be aware of the groundswell of support that appeared for Waluigi.

1766
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,640
And in the end, it's his decision to make.

1767
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:28,160
They will bring him in there.

1768
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,640
He'll be a character by the time the game comes out.

1769
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:31,360
Or DLC.

1770
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,000
He'll be in the roster.

1771
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:34,160
Right.

1772
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:35,840
But he's, he's an assist trophy right now.

1773
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:38,480
They're going to have to take out that assist trophy because you don't have

1774
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,320
characters that are also assist trophies.

1775
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,080
I'm sure they can remove this trophy.

1776
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:42,720
It's Waluigi.

1777
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,360
He can do anything.

1778
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:44,880
I like that.

1779
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,000
That's a good perspective.

1780
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I also found, by the way, that everything that I thought about his name is actually

1781
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,680
accurate, that it is the pun that I thought it was.

1782
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:55,840
Because Walui would be, means bad or sick.

1783
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,280
And so in the G part would be like for person.

1784
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,760
So he just means his name means bad person.

1785
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:08,480
Ranma in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Waluigi is trash.

1786
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:09,280
Fuck him.

1787
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,480
Go away Waluigi.

1788
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:11,280
No one likes you.

1789
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:12,800
Wow.

1790
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:17,920
The views and opinions expressed in our chat room do not reflect those of VOG Network or

1791
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:18,400
ourselves.

1792
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:19,920
Here's that's, that's some powerful words.

1793
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,800
It's funny that he has a thing for Daisy and she's like, bitch, no.

1794
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:30,480
To which, to which I say, Ranma, to which I say, wah, that stupid noise is never going

1795
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:30,960
to get old.

1796
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:38,400
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com

1797
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,880
use the passphrase, butcher.

1798
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:41,840
What are you drinking over there?

1799
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:42,240
You're pretty satisfied.

1800
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:46,560
I mixed the last of my blackberries in with that orange juice that did steal over that

1801
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:47,280
coconut water.

1802
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:47,680
Yeah.

1803
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:51,440
Made myself my own little delicious cocktail and I get to eat blackberries when I'm done.

1804
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,920
She just mixed a little bit of everything.

1805
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,360
Actually, it's kind of a purple drink.

1806
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:56,960
I think I would call that a Waluigi.

1807
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,920
I'll take a picture of it.

1808
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,560
You all know because it's actually delicious and doesn't make me sick.

1809
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:03,520
An official Waluigi drink here at OLR.

1810
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:04,240
All right.

1811
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,720
Then you just have to add a little bit of vodka to top it off.

1812
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:06,960
All right.

1813
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:10,960
Well, you know, oh, by the way, I did finish another infused vodka.

1814
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:11,280
I know.

1815
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,120
I saw the pictures of rose petals, right?

1816
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:17,520
I'd made rose petal vodka and I would be willing to share it with people if they're interested.

1817
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,440
Uh, let's move on.

1818
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:22,560
Dark Sakura, before you take pictures, you got to do some rapid fire news stories of

1819
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,040
your own.

1820
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:26,400
Well, I just took the picture because I can fucking multitask like a bitch.

1821
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:31,120
So anyway, um, also Nintendo is doing some good things for us.

1822
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:34,720
Well, they've already done it and it's probably already sold out by now, but they brought

1823
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:37,600
back the NES classic edition on June 29th.

1824
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:43,200
So two days ago from today, um, they've released it for $59.99.

1825
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:47,440
Just like when it released in November, 2016 has all the same consoles on it.

1826
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:55,920
Like, you know, Super Mario Brothers, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, um, and the SNES classic edition

1827
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,520
is still in production.

1828
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,680
Um, but good luck finding them.

1829
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:05,200
I mean, seriously, I've, I've, I've, I've heard from some people who said that they

1830
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:09,600
found them like at, you know, Walmart, which I don't support and other stores.

1831
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,760
So you may still be lucky.

1832
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:14,640
So if you want it, go and get it while you can.

1833
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:25,520
And I have the final totals for Summer Games Done Quick, which I watched the shit out of.

1834
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:28,800
I saw the countdown when they were trying to reach 2 million.

1835
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:29,760
It was pretty epic.

1836
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:38,000
Um, the total donation amount, um, was, uh, $2,128,069.

1837
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:42,080
And that is over 35,000 people donating.

1838
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:45,600
The average donation by people was about $60 a donation.

1839
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:51,360
I donated, um, Dan and I did.

1840
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:56,560
Um, and I would actually like to say that when we go up for Awesome Games Done Quick,

1841
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:01,920
I was actually thinking of, of putting it out there to our listeners of starting like

1842
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:07,040
a small fund so that we could do a mass donation in the name of Orange Lounge Radio.

1843
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:11,520
Oh, donate so we can donate, donate so we can donate big.

1844
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:12,800
Exactly.

1845
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,240
You know, interesting.

1846
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:16,720
And I would encourage everyone to do, you know, the little bit here and there.

1847
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:22,080
But I think that if we start accumulating the donations, we can make out that one big

1848
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:27,280
massive check so that we can ensure that the animals will be killed on the snow.

1849
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:33,200
I save the animals so we can see that little pixel fly off the planet.

1850
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,960
The animals will be killed.

1851
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,480
No, save the animals.

1852
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,760
Save the frames.

1853
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:38,640
Save the animals.

1854
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:41,280
You're a terrible human being.

1855
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:41,520
All right.

1856
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:41,760
Yeah.

1857
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:46,160
JD says, where would you accept donations to that wouldn't take a percentage fee?

1858
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:46,720
My hand.

1859
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:49,520
No, give me, give me money.

1860
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:50,400
I'll work on it.

1861
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,520
Yeah, we'll see.

1862
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:51,760
Okay.

1863
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:52,880
Dark soccer is going to work on it.

1864
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:54,740
All right.

1865
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:59,200
Meanwhile, let's travel the world and check out some release dates.

1866
01:27:59,200 --> 01:27:59,700
Loki.

1867
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:01,200
There's not much.

1868
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:06,400
I mean, honestly, July is usually a very dead month when it comes to game releases.

1869
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,600
So we've got two.

1870
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,800
We've got run bow coming out on Nintendo switch.

1871
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:18,480
And then your pun title of the week, red faction gorilla, the remarse stirred edition.

1872
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,040
That's on PC.

1873
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:25,700
That's it.

1874
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:27,300
All right.

1875
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,240
Well, let's see what the news is like in Japan.

1876
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:32,400
On July the 5th on PlayStation four.

1877
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:37,600
Zankai zero is out as well as a classic edition of far cry three.

1878
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:40,320
And that's really it for Japan this week on the PlayStation four.

1879
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:46,240
PlayStation Vita also gets that Zankai zero as well as a game called seven days.

1880
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:47,840
Not to be confused with the ring.

1881
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,200
It's actually called seven days.

1882
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,160
Anata two.

1883
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:51,120
So Guso.

1884
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,960
Nano Kaka comes out.

1885
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:59,680
I didn't realize that on the Vita in the U S did you know next week on the Vita in the U S

1886
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,240
good old, uh, OLR favorite title.

1887
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:06,000
Muv Luv is coming out in the U S we're getting our own.

1888
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,080
It's that same company that got denied the, uh, the, uh, translation.

1889
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,960
Anyway, plus rapture, uh, nothing on the switch this week.

1890
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,120
It is a quiet week on the switch in Japan.

1891
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,120
So there's your Japanese releases.

1892
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:22,160
How about the UK dark soccer on the third?

1893
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:24,720
And really the third is the only day with stuff coming out.

1894
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:28,240
We have drastic world evolution for Xbox and PlayStation.

1895
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:33,680
We had red faction gorilla remastered again, same, uh, consoles.

1896
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:37,360
And also on the same consoles is Warhammer 40 K Inquisitor martyr.

1897
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,080
That is it.

1898
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:40,720
Symphony.

1899
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,640
All right, let's get to the mailbag.

1900
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:46,000
We'll have to read fast too.

1901
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,960
Cause every week you guys send us emails and sometimes we read them.

1902
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:51,760
I have hiccups.

1903
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,120
I'm just going to turn it over to Jamie.

1904
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:54,800
I hate radio guys.

1905
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:57,600
Biggest nightmare is hitting me right now.

1906
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:58,640
So Jamie, take it away.

1907
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,320
Participate at orange.radio.com.

1908
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,240
I'm going to be reading fast cause Jamie's got to go.

1909
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:03,760
Cause she's got work in the morning.

1910
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:04,160
Hi guys.

1911
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,520
Just wanted to bring up a few things from last up.

1912
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:07,040
So that kind of struck a nerve with me.

1913
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:08,160
This kind of long email.

1914
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:08,480
Sorry.

1915
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,720
Regardless, I still have been a fan of the show for years.

1916
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:11,680
I will continue to listen.

1917
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,960
First thing I hope I didn't hear the wrong way and clarify if I am,

1918
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:17,600
but dark soccer mentioned the kids included in last of us.

1919
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,520
Part two is some sort of tokenism.

1920
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:22,080
I see his growth of the character and the last of us left behind.

1921
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,520
We saw Ellie lose her best friend who in the end realized she had feelings for

1922
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:25,920
the writing.

1923
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,520
The performances felt incredibly natural and it wasn't shoehorned in.

1924
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,240
I feel like this writing was present in the last of us part two trailer as well

1925
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:36,160
and left behind has earned the believability of her sexuality.

1926
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,640
And her sexuality isn't pointed out in an obnoxious way throughout the

1927
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:40,000
entirety of the last of us.

1928
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,280
The question to this is what is the right way of presenting LGBT characters

1929
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:44,240
in a trailer?

1930
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:48,720
And is it any representation of LGBT in a big event like E3 tokenism?

1931
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:50,080
First of all, I've never played last of us.

1932
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:53,520
So I have any idea about the character story and kind of don't give a shit

1933
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,360
cause I don't want to play last of us.

1934
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:58,400
But to be fair, you did call it tokenism.

1935
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:01,440
I said it seemed like tokenism or if I called it tokenism is more that I

1936
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:06,480
thought it seemed like it cause on the surface, you know, it seems like

1937
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:10,400
something that a big company is going to do is throw a bone to try to attract

1938
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,840
a more diverse audience.

1939
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:12,400
Right.

1940
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,760
You know, here's the thing.

1941
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,200
I wouldn't put it past Sony.

1942
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:18,640
I haven't played the games either because I'm just not big on scary

1943
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:20,160
zombie type games right here.

1944
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:26,080
However, I was aware because we talked about it a couple or a year or two

1945
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,760
ago when that DLC came out.

1946
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:31,600
I remember the big reveal about her sexuality in the DLC.

1947
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,600
So therefore, I know that this is something that's been and as the

1948
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,000
emailer kind of points out, it was developed then.

1949
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,440
And so that's why to me, I'm kind of like, okay, I mean, this isn't just

1950
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:43,680
like surprise, everybody's gay.

1951
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:45,440
Like this isn't like that type of thing.

1952
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:50,000
So I, I think what they did was appropriate, but that's, that's a

1953
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,040
personal perspective.

1954
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,640
Again, I'm not a lesbian.

1955
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:53,760
I'm also ace.

1956
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:57,760
So I don't really see what the fuck point there is that any type of

1957
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,920
romantic subplot is going to add to a game anyway.

1958
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,280
It's just, I mean, okay.

1959
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:04,560
I like it for Mass Effect cause for me, that's like 50% of BioWare games

1960
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:05,520
is who you're going to romance.

1961
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:10,720
But the same thing anyway is just, I'm, I'm, I'm actually a really a lot

1962
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:11,360
more as of late.

1963
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,600
Why does there have to be fucking romance involved in the game anyway?

1964
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:18,320
Well, just to, to, to kind of put the email in perspective, I think as

1965
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:21,040
part of this, cause I think this is written respectfully and you know,

1966
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,560
they say they're a fan.

1967
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:29,040
Um, what if the next, let's say the next big reveal is Mass Effect 4 and

1968
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:34,320
in the Mass Effect 4 trailer, they show, uh, Shepard is back magically

1969
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:35,440
somehow space magic.

1970
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:38,480
Shepard is back and Shepard makes out with Kayden in the trailer.

1971
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:39,920
Is that going to be tokenism?

1972
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:43,920
Well, no, because you can also pick whoever you fucking romance in a

1973
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:44,640
Mass Effect game.

1974
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:45,840
Okay.

1975
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:46,640
Fair, fair.

1976
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:47,920
So there is, there is that choice involved.

1977
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,520
And besides that, my Shepard is always female.

1978
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,040
So I instantly thought femshep.

1979
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:51,200
Okay.

1980
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:54,560
So if femshep makes out with Liara in the trailer, is that tokenism?

1981
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:58,160
Well, they are technically agendered.

1982
01:32:58,160 --> 01:32:58,560
Yeah.

1983
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,120
How about they all have sex with everybody?

1984
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:01,680
No, I'm just kidding.

1985
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:01,840
Okay.

1986
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:02,320
That's fine.

1987
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:03,520
All right.

1988
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:06,160
No, my thought is because again, I don't play that game.

1989
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:07,280
I don't know that game.

1990
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:09,520
I haven't really been interested in that game.

1991
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:12,000
If it's something that's been in development, that's great.

1992
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:17,680
I just think this, that if it's something that was expected, then that's one thing.

1993
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:19,520
And I'll take it back in the case of this game.

1994
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:23,120
But if they'd like say introduce new game and they have two girls kissing

1995
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:28,800
that if we don't have any context around it, then it can seem very much like,

1996
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,240
Oh, by the way, gay stuff.

1997
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,280
Come on people.

1998
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:33,600
So it's kind of like the corporate logos in rainbow.

1999
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,920
It's not about, yeah, it's like the corporate logos in rainbow.

2000
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,440
Put up or shut it up type of thing.

2001
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:38,080
Exactly.

2002
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:38,320
Yeah.

2003
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:39,520
You can't have a rainbow logo.

2004
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:43,920
Now that I, you know, know a little bit more about the character, then that's fine.

2005
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:45,280
I'm fine with it.

2006
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:46,000
I don't care.

2007
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,040
It's clearly not tokenism in that case.

2008
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:56,320
But if it was just like random trailer new game, if Anthem had two girls making out while

2009
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:01,520
two boys are making out and then two completely weird tentacle aliens are making out that

2010
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:04,640
are clearly of whatever the gender is in their particular species.

2011
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:05,140
Yes.

2012
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:09,760
That would seem a little bit, by the way, rainbow logos.

2013
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:10,240
Come on.

2014
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:12,000
BioWare loves you gays.

2015
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:13,760
Exactly.

2016
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,880
Yeah, I get it.

2017
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:15,360
I get it.

2018
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:18,320
I mean, to be fair, I get the perspective kind of you're coming from as well.

2019
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:19,040
So yeah.

2020
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:19,440
Okay.

2021
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:23,360
Second, why is everyone comparing games to other things is kind of annoying to me.

2022
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:27,680
Starlink isn't as open as No Man's Sky and has a narrative present throughout the trailers.

2023
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:29,360
It has very little semblance to it.

2024
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:31,600
And I don't think it's fair to compare games to others.

2025
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:36,400
This affected games like Battleborn, for example, which had MOBA gameplay, unlike Overwatch.

2026
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:42,480
Even then, if something is similar to another game, it can present competition and iteration,

2027
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:44,720
which can improve the gaming industry.

2028
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:48,880
For example, Fortnite and PUBG, which are two different games of the same genre, or

2029
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:49,920
Tomb Raider and Uncharted.

2030
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,320
People like to have, though...

2031
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:57,200
I mean, and this is something that I don't know, because I'm honestly not a big fan of

2032
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:00,240
comparisons along those lines.

2033
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:04,800
But at the same time, people like to link it to something that's familiar to them.

2034
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:05,360
Exactly.

2035
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:08,160
It's how we tend to describe things.

2036
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:11,280
Like, if I were to say, like, I have to do this all the time.

2037
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,960
Like, we'll be out playing Pokemon Go.

2038
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:15,600
And then I'm like, hold on, I got to switch to Ingress real fast.

2039
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:16,480
What's Ingress?

2040
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,680
How do you play Ingress?

2041
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:22,080
And I have to kind of catch myself going, well, it's kind of like Pokemon Go.

2042
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,720
Even though in the back of my head, I'm like, it's actually nothing like Pokemon Go.

2043
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:28,000
But like, that's how this person is going to know it because they play Pokemon Go.

2044
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:32,080
So at least they're going to understand how the real world kind of locations play into it.

2045
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:36,000
So I think sometimes you kind of like have to compare to be able to explain something

2046
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:36,960
to someone.

2047
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:40,640
But really, the best way to know it is to try it your damn self.

2048
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:42,400
Well, it's sort of like the same thing for me.

2049
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:47,120
Like, if I go on Facebook, okay, and say, you know, I hate marshmallows.

2050
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:49,760
And someone goes, well, I love marshmallows.

2051
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:50,880
And I hate this, this and this.

2052
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:54,560
I'm like, well, what the fuck do those other things have to do with the fact that marshmallows

2053
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:55,440
are fucking disgusting?

2054
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:57,360
Well, here's the thing.

2055
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:02,400
I love marshmallows, but you have every right to hate them because I also know that you

2056
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:03,280
have your thing.

2057
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:04,480
I like mayonnaise.

2058
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,080
I hate mayonnaise.

2059
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:06,880
I hate ketchup.

2060
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:07,600
You like it.

2061
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,680
Do you know what the perfect solution is to this problem?

2062
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:10,240
Dark Sakura?

2063
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,000
You can have the marshmallows and I'll have the mayonnaise.

2064
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:12,800
Oh, my God.

2065
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,360
If only we knew how to solve all of our problems.

2066
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:18,640
Oh, I thought it was, you know, putting mayonnaise inside of marshmallows.

2067
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:21,600
No, even that.

2068
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:22,800
Now, given I grew up.

2069
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:26,320
And if you ever watch Emmy made in Japan, she tried this.

2070
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:28,080
I grew up eating mayonnaise on pears.

2071
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:30,160
It's a Southern thing.

2072
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,120
Don't you?

2073
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:34,560
I will take the marshmallows.

2074
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:37,840
You may have the mayonnaise, but marshmallows are disgusting and so is ketchup.

2075
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:44,640
Anyway, third, Sony have been releasing games in the spring and summer seasons rather than

2076
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:45,600
the fall and winter seasons.

2077
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:50,240
Lately, they're less likely to have more games this year after E3, they released God of War

2078
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:54,080
in Detroit, become human this year, and we'll have Spider-Man in September.

2079
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:55,200
Those are some big games.

2080
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:58,960
Hopefully dreams can have a beta in winter and released in the spring.

2081
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:03,040
I do agree, however, that their games are becoming similar to that uncharted slash The

2082
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:06,240
Last of Us third person cinematic stealth action gameplay formula.

2083
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:10,400
To be honest, I'm not that interested in their lineup either.

2084
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:14,000
Death Stranding especially looks incredibly dull to me as someone who hasn't played the

2085
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,120
Metal Gear Solid games.

2086
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:17,920
Once again, I really like listening to the show every week.

2087
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:19,280
I look forward to the discussion.

2088
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:20,080
That's from Multi.

2089
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:24,160
Thank you for a very good and well thought out and actually decently grammar email.

2090
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:28,560
And I think you are right on the Sony thing about how they have a lot of these similar

2091
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,400
types of games, but it does well for them.

2092
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:35,040
I mean, look how well received Uncharted and Last of Us and those games do like people

2093
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:35,920
want more of it.

2094
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:38,000
So that's what Sony's delivering.

2095
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,920
They latch on to what's going to make the money.

2096
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,440
I do want to read one comment from our chat.

2097
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,600
I know you're trying to run through these dark soccer, but I think this is a really

2098
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,840
good response to the whole tokenism thing.

2099
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:52,640
So JD in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com said it's hard to get actual LGBT representation

2100
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,160
without romance.

2101
01:37:54,160 --> 01:38:00,160
We're more than who we love, but there's a long tradition of not showing that as a means

2102
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:00,960
of erasing us.

2103
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,640
That's a very interesting perspective and kind of right.

2104
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:12,480
Like, is there a way to be lesbian, gay, without having or transgender, let's say?

2105
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:16,400
Because remember in transgender is not a sexuality, though.

2106
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:16,960
It's not.

2107
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,400
But here's my point.

2108
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:23,360
Because Mass Effect Andromeda caught a lot of shit because you had that character that

2109
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,560
was dead named herself.

2110
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,040
Exactly.

2111
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:26,160
I'm transgender.

2112
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:26,800
Look at me.

2113
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:30,640
I'm transgender and I'm going to do all these things that a transgender person actually

2114
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:31,280
would never do.

2115
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:38,720
I do know I have a couple of trans friends who will just be upfront about it.

2116
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:42,720
You may have known me as this, or if we were in the same circles, you might have known

2117
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:43,120
this name.

2118
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:44,240
That was me then.

2119
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:47,840
You know, I've known people who've said that, but usually they were people that you knew

2120
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:50,480
or the people that I knew.

2121
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:50,720
Right.

2122
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:52,400
As they were going through this transition.

2123
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:52,720
Yeah.

2124
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:56,160
But at the same time, yeah, you're correct.

2125
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:57,680
No one's really going to dead name themselves.

2126
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:01,600
Anyway, I don't want to drag it out, but I just thought that was a really good point

2127
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:02,160
from JD.

2128
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:05,760
But also, though, my thing, too, is, though, and I'm not referring necessarily to romance

2129
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,480
in the case of it being a gay romance.

2130
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:09,680
I have a thing.

2131
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:15,920
It just seems like romance has become such an integral part to any game or movie or book.

2132
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:21,200
People have to be fucking or something or falling in love.

2133
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:26,960
And I'm like, can't you have a relationship in a book or movie or a game that is based

2134
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:29,120
on really strong friendship?

2135
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:32,560
Or how about something where the thing you learn to love is yourself?

2136
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:35,680
Because if you can't love yourself, how the hell you gonna love somebody else?

2137
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:37,280
Can I get an amen up in here?

2138
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:37,920
Next email.

2139
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:38,980
Okay.

2140
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:43,040
I've been listening to the show for a while, and I was wondering who is this, Ron?

2141
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:45,360
By the way, it's R-A-N-M-A, just letting you know.

2142
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,160
This is also from another Jamie, which is great.

2143
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:49,920
I don't have a nickname on here, though.

2144
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:55,520
Guy that calls in when you open the Skyplines, you all seem to be friends and have some history.

2145
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:59,040
I have no idea of if I even said his name correctly.

2146
01:39:59,040 --> 01:39:59,680
Lol.

2147
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:00,880
Explain this person.

2148
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:01,680
Lol.

2149
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:06,560
By the way, I've listened to damn near every gaming podcast, and OLR feels like home base

2150
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:07,120
for me.

2151
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:08,880
I look forward to hearing you all every week.

2152
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,400
Oh, thank you, Name Twin.

2153
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:10,900
Thank you.

2154
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:14,000
Ron has been our buddy for an age.

2155
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,720
He's been there practically since the beginning, you know, through the live 365 era.

2156
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:20,480
He's been with us for an age.

2157
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:21,520
He's been out here.

2158
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:23,040
We've gone to conventions.

2159
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:25,920
He has his own show called Anime Jam Session with his buddies.

2160
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:26,420
Yes.

2161
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,520
And he's just a really awesome guy.

2162
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:30,480
And on top of that,

2163
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:33,200
And he needs to not pay his friends money to write emails about him.

2164
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:33,920
No, I'm kidding.

2165
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,480
I'm totally kidding.

2166
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:34,960
I'm kidding.

2167
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:40,960
But I've, you know, we've all we've become really just good friends anyway.

2168
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:43,920
I mean, I'd consider him part of part of our family here.

2169
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:44,420
Oh, for sure.

2170
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:52,000
And the thing is, emailer, before we did not know Ranma before this show.

2171
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:57,680
We know Ranma and many people that call in, not just Ranma, but many of the regulars.

2172
01:40:57,680 --> 01:40:58,800
You know, we love our regulars.

2173
01:40:58,800 --> 01:40:59,760
We love new people, too.

2174
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,680
Everybody should feel free to call in and participate.

2175
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:02,800
It's for everybody.

2176
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,080
It's where every gamer has a voice.

2177
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:09,600
But like, there are so many people that we have met and become friends with and do feel

2178
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,600
like family because of this show.

2179
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:15,440
And it is it is a feeling I can't really describe.

2180
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:16,400
We find our tribe.

2181
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:17,440
We've created this thing.

2182
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,400
Yeah, we find our tribe.

2183
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:19,200
I like that.

2184
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:19,920
We sure do.

2185
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,200
That's a good note to end that on.

2186
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:22,320
You know, we have one last email.

2187
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:24,320
Merry evening, peoples.

2188
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:25,920
By the way, this is Redertainment.

2189
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:29,280
I've noticed an odd thing in an article posted by an outlet.

2190
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:32,240
Sky has stated he has reservations about Polygon.

2191
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:38,000
This, hold on, let me find the article real quick.

2192
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:43,040
So the article here is the seven year old Sims mobile game is being pulled from Chinese

2193
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:43,600
app stores.

2194
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:49,600
The headline of the story leads with the game being removed from Chinese app stores.

2195
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:54,000
But the other six countries affected by this are predominantly Muslim countries.

2196
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:59,920
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar and Egypt.

2197
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:05,280
The article also cites a source from a company manager from EA that the game is being removed

2198
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:06,640
for regional standards.

2199
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:10,560
Speculation among fans is that the content is being removed.

2200
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:12,640
Wait, never mind.

2201
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:14,080
I skipped to the same line again.

2202
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:18,720
Speculation among fans is that the content is being removed because of regional standards

2203
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:20,080
in Muslim countries.

2204
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:21,600
I'd like to join that speculation.

2205
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:25,920
It is my honest belief that this game was pulled from the app stores that are predominantly

2206
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:29,840
Muslim countries because the game no longer meets the regional standards of those countries.

2207
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:34,000
Remove the game from Chinese app stores at the same time may just be coincidence.

2208
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:38,240
Anyway, the point of me sending this email, why lead with the game being removed from

2209
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:43,200
Chinese app stores when the game is being removed from many countries, from many countries

2210
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:46,160
app stores, most of whom are majority Muslim?

2211
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:50,240
Isn't the game being removed from the app store of majority Muslim countries the lead?

2212
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:52,960
Bottom line, Sky is correct to distrust articles from Polygon.

2213
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:53,840
Yes, Sky is correct.

2214
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,040
Pause to allow for gloating.

2215
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:55,680
Stay black.

2216
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:56,720
Redertainment.

2217
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:59,120
I distrust headlines from a lot of places.

2218
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:02,000
Here, you know, articles are not right.

2219
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:06,320
Or, you know, most websites are not writing articles with headlines to accurately reflect

2220
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:07,440
what's in the story anymore.

2221
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,560
They're writing headlines to get you to click on on Facebook.

2222
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:13,200
I mean, that's the reality.

2223
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:16,640
So, you know, US versus China is very in right now.

2224
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:20,640
Thanks to all this talk about terror tariffs and all this stuff you see on the national

2225
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:20,880
news.

2226
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:25,120
I'm not going to get into politics, but that's the reality is US versus China is super in

2227
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:25,520
right now.

2228
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:30,000
So, I think that's what you're seeing with some of that, you know.

2229
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:36,880
To be fair, as much as I don't want to give this particular website credit, I will, because

2230
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:37,840
I'm a fair person.

2231
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:44,800
To be fair, the population of China is much bigger than any other country in the world.

2232
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:49,040
So, it is fair to kind of lead off with China because it is the most populated.

2233
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:51,600
But I think an accurate headline would have been game is removed.

2234
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:52,640
Your larger world power.

2235
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:56,320
Game was removed from eight countries or whatever the total number was.

2236
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:59,280
I'm sorry, I didn't catch the whole number, but may have been a more accurate reflection

2237
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:00,480
of what's going on.

2238
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:08,400
But anyway, Bobby Blackwell in chat says, also realized that on most web websites, the author

2239
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,600
of the article does not write the headline.

2240
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:14,400
The editor does after reading the article.

2241
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:15,360
That's a very good point.

2242
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:21,360
JD also brings up, it might also be that China has its own internet and therefore its own

2243
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:22,080
app store.

2244
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:23,520
So, some thoughts from our chatters.

2245
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:25,440
Any other emails or was that it?

2246
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:26,800
That was it.

2247
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:30,640
And on that note, I will bid everyone a fond adieu for the evening.

2248
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:31,600
Well, thanks for being here.

2249
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:34,160
As always, Dark Sakura, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?

2250
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:36,640
I'm going to fucking eat another one of these chocolates.

2251
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:38,960
I don't care how sick it makes me because it's amazing.

2252
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,400
They are pretty fucking good, aren't they?

2253
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:41,360
Oh my God, yes.

2254
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:42,240
Enjoy.

2255
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:43,680
All right, there you go.

2256
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:50,000
So, if you want to send us an email for a future week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

2257
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:53,600
We're going to get into some more news and I'm going to apologize because I can't seem

2258
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:55,760
to get rid of these hiccups, but I'm going to do my best.

2259
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:58,880
So, let's go to Loki to get some gaming news.

2260
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:01,840
All right, so this is unfortunate.

2261
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:08,080
There is a whole issue with companies suing other companies for copying things.

2262
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:14,160
So, for example, you know, you had the folks at Bluehole that were suing Epic Games for

2263
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:17,200
copying.

2264
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:17,760
No, I don't know.

2265
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:18,560
Don't they use bleach?

2266
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:19,920
They probably don't.

2267
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:20,720
Weren't you leaving?

2268
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,920
You're the one who brought it back stuff earlier, I'm just saying.

2269
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:30,960
So, unfortunately, you know, they were accused of copying something and we'll get to that

2270
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:35,200
in a little bit, but this is another game that actually has been on my radar because

2271
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:39,280
I have it in my, I want list for Steam.

2272
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:40,960
It's a game called Donut Country.

2273
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:45,840
It's a sort of, I guess, sort of like a reverse katamari game.

2274
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:51,520
So, basically, you have a hole that you control that you suck up things in and as, you know,

2275
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:56,080
things fall into the hole, the hole gets bigger and you can drop more things into the hole.

2276
01:45:56,720 --> 01:46:02,640
So, this game's been in development for a while and because of that and with the new

2277
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:07,360
information that's been out there, somebody has stolen that idea and put out a game called

2278
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:10,560
Hole.io because that's so fucking clever.

2279
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,440
Holy moly.

2280
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:17,680
It's on the iOS store and, you know, I went into this endeavor to make something meaningful

2281
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:21,280
to people and spent a long time trying to figure out what it looks like.

2282
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:24,880
I had to make all the little details myself.

2283
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:25,920
I wanted it to matter.

2284
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:30,320
They just took the elevator pitch, the unique selling point.

2285
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:36,320
It is the message that can, it's the message that content doesn't matter.

2286
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:39,680
The message is if you can find the content for free, take it.

2287
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:47,200
So, that's kind of unfortunate that someone kind of stole the concept of the game, but

2288
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:49,280
I'm looking for the actual game coming out.

2289
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:53,520
And I guess this is why companies don't announce stuff way in advance anymore because people

2290
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,040
will just flat out fucking steal it.

2291
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:56,420
Yeah.

2292
01:46:57,120 --> 01:46:59,920
So, I mean, there's a lot of games that are kind of like that.

2293
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:02,640
So, I don't know.

2294
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:07,440
And apparently, I think this company has been doing this for a while.

2295
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:12,400
There's other companies, you know, they've had that ridiculous fish scene had an issue.

2296
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,600
There was a different publisher that released a game called Ninja Fishing that was very

2297
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:18,100
similar.

2298
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:24,320
There was, I guess, another, I don't know.

2299
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:28,320
It just, it's unfortunate.

2300
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:32,880
But, you know, honestly, though, even though they stole the premise of the game, it's going

2301
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:34,160
to come out to the polish.

2302
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:40,880
And I think that this whole this game is going to be much more polished when it comes out.

2303
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:45,600
This other like whole IO thing was just made using like Unity assets from the store, like

2304
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:46,960
$20 Unity assets, right?

2305
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:48,240
Yeah, it looks really cheap.

2306
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:48,740
Silly.

2307
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:53,200
And I mean, that's you see that a lot of times he's really fast, like kind of make a quick

2308
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:53,920
buck game.

2309
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:55,840
So, whatever.

2310
01:47:55,840 --> 01:48:00,480
I mean, it does suck, but true quality wins out in the end, usually.

2311
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:03,280
All right.

2312
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:08,000
So, the latest and greatest of what's going on in EA Star Wars drama.

2313
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:12,800
So, you might remember in October, EA shut down Visceral Games that was working on a

2314
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:14,400
secret Star Wars project.

2315
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:19,760
And Amy Henning, who is famous for Uncharted, kind of going back to that email earlier,

2316
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:20,800
was a big part of this.

2317
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:25,280
But Amy Henning left the company and there was really no talk about what happened to

2318
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:27,120
the game, what happened to anything with this.

2319
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:33,040
Well, at a conference called Game Lab in Barcelona this past week, Amy Henning talked to Eurogamer

2320
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:39,040
about how she actually left EA in January of this year and was starting up her own new

2321
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:43,280
independent studio, but hadn't had a chance to announce what's going on or talk about

2322
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:43,760
what it is.

2323
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:49,440
Apparently, she was asked about, is she still the creative director of a Star Wars project?

2324
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,440
The reply was, I'm not.

2325
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:54,000
I haven't worked at EA since January, technically legally.

2326
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:55,360
This is the problem.

2327
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:58,960
It was hard enough for them, but people were immediately asking them, is Amy working with

2328
01:48:58,960 --> 01:48:59,520
you?

2329
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:04,000
And the answer was, well, we're in negotiations, you know, because that's the way these things

2330
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:04,480
go.

2331
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:06,880
I haven't been in, but look, I get along with all those people.

2332
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:10,960
I consider even the guys on the executive team friends, but it made it awkward because

2333
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:15,280
it was like, I never got the chance to announce that I'm not at EA, so I just need to pull

2334
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:18,400
off that bandaid at some point, but also had nothing to announce.

2335
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:22,480
It makes it sound like I just went home, but I'm doing all this stuff, working on all kinds

2336
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:22,960
of things.

2337
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:26,720
And thanks to that last story, you know why she isn't talking about them.

2338
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:30,960
Yes, because somebody would probably just steal them, but she's working independently

2339
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:32,000
and that's what's going on.

2340
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:38,080
So that project is on the shelf now is the last word on that.

2341
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:42,240
So rest in peace, EA Star Wars project.

2342
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:46,320
Look, you want to take this next one that was marked for Jamie before she left?

2343
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:50,560
I'm sure we can do that because I still have this stupid hiccup thing going on.

2344
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:51,040
I hate it.

2345
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:54,080
Oh no, I'm gonna get more water while you do these stories.

2346
01:49:54,080 --> 01:50:02,160
All right, so Mega Man X5, you know, was just recently released, re-released, and they've

2347
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:06,320
actually taken out some of these Guns N' Roses references.

2348
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:13,440
So with the Mega Man X Legacy Collection 1 and 2, I'm not even really sure what the original

2349
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:14,800
references were.

2350
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:16,240
Oh, I guess so.

2351
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:18,400
Let's see.

2352
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:24,240
They had, I guess it was with the localization.

2353
01:50:24,240 --> 01:50:30,880
Oh, so they had, you know, you know, and now that I think of it, didn't they have like

2354
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:35,760
references to other stuff or Guns N' Roses stuff and like Super Mario Bros 3 as well,

2355
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:37,840
you know, with the Koopas and stuff.

2356
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:42,640
Lemmy Koopa after Lemmy and then...

2357
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:46,880
They were all named after like punk rock icons, like Wendy O.

2358
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:49,600
I guess it makes sense that they all kind of like punk rock anyways.

2359
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,400
I mean, it makes sense.

2360
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:56,080
But yeah, in this game, the boss robots or the big robot things were, they changed names.

2361
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:58,080
They didn't use the literal Japanese translations.

2362
01:50:58,080 --> 01:51:03,360
They made them like, they were like parody names off like people that were in Guns N'

2363
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:03,760
Roses.

2364
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:04,640
It was a little silly.

2365
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:10,080
Yeah, so they decided to go ahead and just basically said that in our mission to make

2366
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:14,160
these collections an authentic Mega Man X experience, we took an opportunity to better

2367
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:21,840
align the names of the Mega Man X5 Mavericks across all regions for better narrative cohesion

2368
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:26,240
across the series, making the names more aligned with the original Japanese versions.

2369
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:32,720
We hope the fans appreciate our intent on unifying the Mega Man X Maverick naming conventions

2370
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:33,360
after all.

2371
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:37,360
Yes, they do.

2372
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,080
Interesting.

2373
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:41,680
I don't know.

2374
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:45,280
It's neat, I guess, that they did that.

2375
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:49,440
But no one else is also neat and interesting.

2376
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:55,600
This whole lawsuit with PUBG Corp and Epic over Fortnite.

2377
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:59,920
So they dropped the lawsuit and there's no, we don't know why.

2378
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:04,960
They just, they filed the dismissal and that's that.

2379
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:12,480
And my thoughts, maybe they just didn't, I mean, honestly, the argument was kind of shallow

2380
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:12,880
anyways.

2381
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:18,640
They didn't really have any sort of way of, I don't know, they're like, oh yeah, each

2382
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:22,240
game has a frying pan and it's a similar type of gameplay.

2383
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:24,160
I don't think that was really much to go on.

2384
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:30,160
Um, but wasn't there something where like in one country they essentially have like

2385
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:31,360
the same parent company?

2386
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:32,560
Yes.

2387
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:33,200
Yeah.

2388
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:33,600
Yes.

2389
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:38,160
And so it's like they're essentially suing themselves in one area.

2390
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:42,240
So it's a little, you know, maybe together they can work a little.

2391
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:44,320
So it may have had something to do with that.

2392
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:47,040
It may have been because their suit was kind of weak.

2393
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:48,880
Who knows?

2394
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:51,360
But I don't know.

2395
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:56,000
One other thing that we didn't mention though that I wanted to was there's another lawsuit

2396
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:01,840
actually going on with Bethesda and Warner games and see Bethesda released this very

2397
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:06,400
popular game that everybody's aware of now called, um, fallout shelter.

2398
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:13,680
And so now Warner games had a company, I think that actually had that originally worked on

2399
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:19,680
fallout shelter or had access to that code or something came out with a Westworld themed

2400
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:26,160
game that looks extremely like fallout shelter, even to the point of having the same type

2401
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:32,720
of bugs in their code at launch that fallout shelter had, which made them suspicious that

2402
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:37,600
perhaps they were using our old code to create this game perhaps.

2403
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:40,400
And so now there's a whole suit against that as well.

2404
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:44,800
So we'll have to see how that plays out, but that's kind of where things are going.

2405
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:49,280
Lawsuits, lawsuits, lawsuits, some clarifications in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

2406
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:52,640
Dungeon buster says 10 cent has a major stake in Epic.

2407
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:55,520
They pretty much own them, but only a minor stake in blue holes.

2408
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:57,600
So they don't own them at least not yet.

2409
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:03,200
And Bobby Black Wolf says, honestly, Bethesda finding stolen code by looking at the bugs

2410
01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:05,040
is the most with the thing ever.

2411
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:05,760
Yes, it is.

2412
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:06,320
True point.

2413
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:11,040
And some light on the super Mario brothers three localization that you brought up there.

2414
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:13,760
Dark Tetsuya says the super Mario thing.

2415
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:19,040
A lot of them were references to famous musicians like Lemmy was Lemmy killmeister of Motorhead.

2416
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:21,280
Roy was Roy Orbison.

2417
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:23,520
And there were a couple others and JD follows up.

2418
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:25,600
Wendy Williams, Aggie pop.

2419
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:29,760
And Larry was named after no one, but that was all North American localization.

2420
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:31,440
Crap.

2421
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:32,320
We need one more name.

2422
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:38,240
Larry done inky pinky blinky and Sue.

2423
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:43,040
Or is it Clyde?

2424
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:45,120
I think it was Clyde and Pac-Man and Sue and Ms.

2425
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:46,560
Pac-Man anyway.

2426
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:48,160
All right.

2427
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:55,280
Moving on one more story for you guys before we open up the Skype line over at orange lounge

2428
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:56,960
radio, all one word on Skype.

2429
01:54:57,600 --> 01:55:00,960
How many of you guys have played Shaq Fu a legend reborn?

2430
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:03,120
I'm shocked to Loki that you haven't checked this out.

2431
01:55:03,120 --> 01:55:05,520
I wasn't a fan of the first Shaq Fu game.

2432
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:06,480
I mean, it looked okay.

2433
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:08,560
Well, it's, it's a legendary born.

2434
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:10,960
Now the physical edition just came out this past week.

2435
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:16,000
Apparently physical editions of the game have a leaflet with instructions on how to unlock

2436
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:22,080
a bonus game called Barack Fu, the adventures of dirty Barry.

2437
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:26,080
Which of course the main character is very much Barack Obama.

2438
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:31,440
And I believe the way American parody laws and so forth are written.

2439
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:33,440
You can parody politicians all you want.

2440
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:38,960
If you want to do a game about Shaquille O'Neal and use his likeness, you have to pay him

2441
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:39,280
money.

2442
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:42,640
You have to, he has to sign away his likeness.

2443
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:48,720
But the reason why you had all these political figures in, uh, MBA jam back in the day is

2444
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:53,920
because with politicians, you don't owe them that same thing because they are politicians.

2445
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:56,800
They are in the public eye, therefore they can be parodied.

2446
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:02,080
So, uh, Barack Obama, I guess made a good target for a game like this because they did

2447
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:04,240
not have to get his permission for it.

2448
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:09,840
So they say, and yes, the game calls itself a parody of one of the greatest heroes of

2449
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:10,400
our time.

2450
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:19,520
As the ex POTUS on notice, you will step in when the police can't figure out why a number

2451
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:23,120
of celebrities have been killed in order to solve the case yourself.

2452
01:56:23,120 --> 01:56:27,040
And there are some trailers out there if you want to check it out called Barack Fu, which

2453
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:29,200
is a side game of Shaq Fu.

2454
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:29,920
Let's face it.

2455
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:35,040
They are both going to be shitty, but good for some walls, right?

2456
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:36,080
Yep.

2457
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:36,400
All right.

2458
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:37,360
Yeah.

2459
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:39,840
Dark to see in chat says, I almost want to check that out.

2460
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:40,960
Yep.

2461
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:41,840
All right.

2462
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:44,560
Anyway, let's get to the Skype line.

2463
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:47,360
Orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

2464
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:51,040
I'll do the best I can to talk to you through these hiccups while we wait to see if any

2465
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:51,760
calls come in.

2466
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:54,320
Do we have any last minute stories?

2467
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:55,200
I don't.

2468
01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:57,520
I looked, we burned through a lot of stuff.

2469
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:00,320
It seemed like it was a busy news week, but we burned through a lot of it.

2470
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:02,800
I mean, we can just kind of add more fuel to the fire.

2471
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:07,520
Basically, uh, Bethesda's Todd Howard said Sony is preventing fallout 76 cross play.

2472
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:08,720
Oh, I heard that one too.

2473
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:08,960
Yeah.

2474
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:12,000
And remember they, they said we're listening.

2475
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,840
We hear your concerns.

2476
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:16,320
Yeah, but they're not going to, they don't hear them right now.

2477
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:20,480
They're trying to figure it out for six months from now, maybe, but they're not hearing it

2478
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:20,880
right now.

2479
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:21,840
All right.

2480
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:23,920
We got a call coming in, so let's get to it.

2481
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:24,240
Uh, hello.

2482
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:25,120
You're on orange lounge radio.

2483
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:25,440
Who's this?

2484
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:27,840
Hey, uh, Robert.

2485
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:28,240
Sorry.

2486
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:29,520
What's on your mind?

2487
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:31,680
Uh, no, hold on.

2488
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:36,560
Um, well, yeah, I wanted to bring up pinball arcade.

2489
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,080
Oh, right.

2490
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:39,040
Fuck that ended.

2491
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:40,480
And I forgot to buy the tables.

2492
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:41,280
God damn it.

2493
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:43,120
Oh, yeah.

2494
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:43,360
Yeah.

2495
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:45,360
I was going to ask you exactly that.

2496
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:47,760
Cause you didn't exactly mention daddy.

2497
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:49,040
God damn it.

2498
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:50,160
No, I forgot.

2499
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:51,600
And the month is now over.

2500
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:52,640
No, I went out of town.

2501
01:57:52,640 --> 01:57:54,480
This is what happens when I go on vacation.

2502
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:59,120
So I'll just have to do what everybody else on the internet does and steal them.

2503
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:00,080
Hmm.

2504
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:04,080
Well, yeah, I wouldn't recommend doing that.

2505
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:07,200
Cause I know, no, I wouldn't, I wouldn't either.

2506
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:10,320
I want to reward the hardworking developers, but if they're gone, they're gone.

2507
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:11,280
You know what I mean?

2508
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:11,520
Yeah.

2509
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:12,640
Yeah.

2510
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:19,520
But, um, yeah, it's kind of a shame that the whole thing with the billion Williams went

2511
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:20,640
down like it did.

2512
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:21,360
Cause no.

2513
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:24,560
Well, well, I mean, we'll just, we'll just have to see what's next.

2514
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:26,560
I mean, there's obviously some type of reason for it.

2515
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:31,040
So we have to see kind of like, where does the licensing end up going from here?

2516
01:58:31,040 --> 01:58:36,160
You know, is there, or, or is there a reason they pulled it or was it purely financially

2517
01:58:36,160 --> 01:58:36,800
motivated?

2518
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:41,680
We'll, we'll find out hopefully in the coming year or two as whatever studio maybe has the

2519
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:47,200
license now announces what they're working on, whether it be a VR thing or who knows?

2520
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:48,880
It could be a variety of mobile phones.

2521
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:49,280
Who knows?

2522
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:50,560
Yeah.

2523
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:50,960
Yeah.

2524
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:57,120
I suppose that we could possibly speculate right now as to what the reasons are, but

2525
01:58:57,120 --> 01:59:03,200
it's simply their speculation and it will be a, probably a complete waste of energy

2526
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:04,000
to do that.

2527
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:08,240
But it, you know, like you were saying, you're saying it was kind of a shame, you know, you

2528
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:13,840
have, you know, you know, got to do everything, got to do lists like that, you know, um, you

2529
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:20,320
know, cause unfortunately, uh, you know, while I love pinball, um, unfortunately I've been

2530
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:26,560
focusing more on buying the pinball effects, uh, tables and I kind of figured, you know

2531
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:33,120
what, the pinball arcade tables will always be around, you know, I'll have full intensive

2532
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:38,000
purpose, infant male time to buy the table, so I slacked off on buying that.

2533
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:41,920
But I mean, it's not like the pinball effects tables are bad and some of them have like

2534
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:42,480
licenses.

2535
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:45,680
They're just, they're just not based on anything in reality.

2536
01:59:45,680 --> 01:59:47,520
But some of those pinball effects tables are great.

2537
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:50,880
Like some of their star Wars tables are a lot of fun and you know, they, they have the

2538
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:51,920
cool Marvel tables.

2539
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:54,160
Didn't pinball effects have the street fighter table too?

2540
01:59:54,160 --> 01:59:54,960
I think they did.

2541
01:59:54,960 --> 02:00:02,560
Oh, so the original game yesterday, in fact, I got the speed fire table on the Xbox live.

2542
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:09,680
Unfortunately, you know, since, uh, pinball effects never came to steam, as far as I know,

2543
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:11,840
I, you know, at least not.

2544
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:14,400
FX3 is on steam.

2545
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:15,280
I don't know about the original.

2546
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:21,600
Yeah, you know, the first two, you know, well, your pinball effects two was on steam is no

2547
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:22,480
longer on steam.

2548
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:28,240
Uh, you still have access to, uh, you know, two if you bought, you know, bought content

2549
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:32,880
for that is, uh, you know, like you said, uh, threes on there as well.

2550
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:38,960
And virtually all, all, you know, the tables that you bought onto with the exception of

2551
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:42,080
a handful, like, uh, the, the soccer tables.

2552
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:47,600
Um, you know, I think, um, the explosion, you know, Miss exposure, man, T1, a couple

2553
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:51,280
hours didn't make it, uh, get transferred to three.

2554
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:54,880
But other than that, Eric, if you had on two, you could play on three.

2555
02:00:55,520 --> 02:01:00,320
But yeah, you know, getting back to my initial point before I got some sidetracked, you know,

2556
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:04,960
first I got behind the evil, you know, what wanted by tables.

2557
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:08,720
I was only able to buy two, uh, yesterday.

2558
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:14,160
I managed to get a Jack Bach, you know, about, and the one other one, I forget the name of

2559
02:01:14,160 --> 02:01:19,360
it, but I would have loved to have bought more, but it's not financially feasible this

2560
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:19,680
month.

2561
02:01:19,680 --> 02:01:23,920
So I kind of like, you know, you snooze, you lose, you know?

2562
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:24,240
Yeah.

2563
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:26,000
We can only do what we can do.

2564
02:01:26,640 --> 02:01:30,080
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf is referencing something that came up on his show earlier about the,

2565
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:31,600
uh, Jack box Royal.

2566
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:33,120
He talked about this on his show.

2567
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:37,440
Uh, he would like, and, uh, I guess, I guess I'll say it here, Bobby, since you're convinced

2568
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:42,400
they still listen to OLR, if anyone at Jack box still does listen to this show, uh, Bobby

2569
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:46,320
Black Wolf thinks you need to do your own version of one versus 100, and that can be

2570
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:48,560
your battle Royal game, your Jack box Royal.

2571
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:53,760
So, uh, take one versus 100, marry it with, you don't know Jack or trivia murder party

2572
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:58,880
or one of those, uh, at what, why not murder Royal trivia murder Royal, honestly.

2573
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:01,200
And, uh, yeah, uh, kill a hundred of your friends.

2574
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:01,840
It'd be fun.

2575
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:04,240
So, uh, Jack box, we're putting that out there.

2576
02:02:04,240 --> 02:02:04,880
You know what?

2577
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:06,160
You know what buddies?

2578
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:07,920
You don't even have to pay us for that idea.

2579
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:09,680
Just, just having a little shout out in the credits.

2580
02:02:09,680 --> 02:02:10,320
That's all we want.

2581
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:16,400
Now, now that you brought up, uh, uh, the Jack box, uh, party games.

2582
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:23,040
Um, and I have a question regarding that and considering that I never played those and

2583
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:26,000
only played out the, you don't know Jack games.

2584
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:33,280
Uh, no, how would you say they compare to, uh, the, uh, Jack box compares to, you don't

2585
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:38,320
know, uh, Jack, is it better to see, is it like Apple store?

2586
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:40,240
It's a very similar sense of humor.

2587
02:02:40,240 --> 02:02:45,520
Um, a lot of the Jack box games in those party packs, there's a lot of voting type of games

2588
02:02:46,240 --> 02:02:48,400
where there isn't necessarily a definitive answer.

2589
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:51,520
Um, it will, you know, prompt you for certain things.

2590
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:54,960
But that was always like a good part about like board games, like, you know, something

2591
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:55,760
like Pictionary.

2592
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:59,520
Pictionary can be serious, but it can also be really funny if you play with a lot of

2593
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:03,040
like really disgusting people, then they're going to draw everything really perverted

2594
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:04,160
as all the pictures.

2595
02:03:04,160 --> 02:03:08,000
So that's kind of where Jack box kind of goes is that it gives you just these ideas.

2596
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,560
And then ultimately the canvas is your idea.

2597
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:13,120
There's not a lot that stays on a very linear path.

2598
02:03:13,120 --> 02:03:17,200
Like you don't know, Jack sort of does, except for what comes to mind trivia murder party,

2599
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:21,280
which was kind of like the, you don't know Jack game that wasn't exactly, you don't know

2600
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:24,080
Jack, but it was made for mobile phones, that whole sort of thing.

2601
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:27,760
Uh, so you can see that, but, uh, I would definitely encourage you to watch some Twitch

2602
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:30,640
streams, um, you know, to get a real sense for what the game is.

2603
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:35,120
But ultimately I think Jack box is, is a great game for people that like board game night.

2604
02:03:35,680 --> 02:03:39,920
Um, another group of people I've played Jack box games with and had a lot of success is

2605
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:46,240
that you guys know, I was playing these online, um, survivor type games, uh, a couple months

2606
02:03:46,240 --> 02:03:46,800
ago.

2607
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:51,040
And, uh, some of the people like when we were doing calls on Skype, the tribe calls, we

2608
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:54,720
call them somewhat, we just play Jack box games to kind of like bond a little bit.

2609
02:03:54,720 --> 02:03:57,920
Somebody would screen share and we played the Jack box games of the screen sharing.

2610
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:03,360
And these are people that usually don't play a lot of video games, but surely would still

2611
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:04,640
play board games and stuff.

2612
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:08,800
So I think Jack box is great as like digital board games.

2613
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:10,640
I think is the best way I can put it.

2614
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:12,960
All right.

2615
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:18,880
Well, on the final note before I, you know, I'll let you guys go up to take more calls,

2616
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:24,720
um, on a note tangentially related to video games.

2617
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:31,840
Uh, if some of you may know, you know, over on GOG, you know, granted they predominantly

2618
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:33,200
deal in video games.

2619
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:42,880
They do have a very small, uh, you know, limited quantity of movies for sale.

2620
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:52,320
One of which I highly recommend is, uh, is actually a concert, uh, put on by, uh, you

2621
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:59,920
know, the composer of, uh, the whip, the witcher three, uh, wild hunt, uh, you know, where

2622
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:03,840
they get a concert, you know, it's all kind of festival over in Poland.

2623
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:04,080
Core.

2624
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:07,520
It makes total sense because GOG is owned by the same people that made the winter.

2625
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:09,920
So it makes sense that that's, that's a thing that they're pushing.

2626
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:10,960
Yeah.

2627
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:11,280
Yeah.

2628
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:18,560
And the nice thing is now they give you multiple resolutions in the video, including 4k.

2629
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:22,960
If you happen to have the setup to play 4k videos.

2630
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:29,280
So if you like, you know, the witcher series, you'd be like video game music.

2631
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:36,560
And if you want something to show off your 4k set up by all means, check out the video.

2632
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:37,600
The music's great.

2633
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:39,200
The concert's great.

2634
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:46,240
And, you know, I mean, I've been watching constantly, uh, for the past two, 24 hours

2635
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:46,640
or so.

2636
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:49,840
Something to check out.

2637
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:50,160
All right.

2638
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:51,760
Anyway, have a nice day.

2639
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:52,960
You know, take care.

2640
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:53,440
Take care.

2641
02:05:53,440 --> 02:05:53,600
Bye.

2642
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:58,320
Uh, and dungeon buster and chat follows up the music for witcher three is really, really

2643
02:05:58,320 --> 02:05:58,560
good.

2644
02:05:58,560 --> 02:05:58,800
Yeah.

2645
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:02,800
I mean, that whole game was the artist, artistic presentation of that game was so good.

2646
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:07,200
When I say artistic, I don't just mean graphics, but music is definitely a part of that art.

2647
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:09,920
Orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

2648
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:13,280
If anybody else wants to give us a call and, uh, call in.

2649
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:17,280
So I'm trying to, I'm looking at like some of the websites, uh, with some of the gaming

2650
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:18,800
news for last minute stories.

2651
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:24,640
And I still see stories Loki about destiny to still going, I guess the solstice of heroes

2652
02:06:24,640 --> 02:06:29,920
event in a crucible playlist changes are coming in July, July for those that are still grinding

2653
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:31,040
away on destiny too.

2654
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:35,520
Although I wonder if there is going to be a destiny three destiny three at this point.

2655
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:37,200
Anyway, we have another call coming in.

2656
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:38,240
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

2657
02:06:38,240 --> 02:06:38,960
Who's this?

2658
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:40,160
Hey, what's going on everyone?

2659
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:40,960
It's Rama.

2660
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:41,280
Rama.

2661
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:43,120
Your mic sucks, but I'll allow it.

2662
02:06:43,120 --> 02:06:44,240
What's up, buddy?

2663
02:06:44,240 --> 02:06:45,280
That's not suck.

2664
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:47,440
Nobody else has this problem except for you, sir.

2665
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:49,280
I don't know.

2666
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:52,240
You're going to hear this back and you're going to be like, something sounds different

2667
02:06:52,240 --> 02:06:53,120
than it used to.

2668
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:54,160
All right, well, what's up buddy?

2669
02:06:54,720 --> 02:07:01,440
Well, in case you have missed it, we had a mini a couple of weeks ago and saw, and we're

2670
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:02,960
kind of sad you weren't there for it.

2671
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:07,440
I saw the pictures of you and, uh, what the hell does he go by now?

2672
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:10,000
Drew Nami, who was the 23rd magus back in the day?

2673
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:10,240
Yes.

2674
02:07:10,240 --> 02:07:11,280
I saw those pictures.

2675
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:14,320
I was, uh, I was like, is there a convention going on?

2676
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:17,840
I wasn't aware of, but no, he was just visiting New York as, as people sometimes do.

2677
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:18,880
Yeah.

2678
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:21,440
The funny thing is I had no idea he was in town.

2679
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:23,360
I had just gotten out of the movies.

2680
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:24,560
I'm just checking Facebook.

2681
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:27,360
I'm like, what are you doing here?

2682
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:28,720
He's at the way station.

2683
02:07:28,720 --> 02:07:32,000
So I'm like, I can be there in 35 minutes.

2684
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:34,720
And 40 minutes later you made it.

2685
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:35,360
No, I'm just kidding.

2686
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:38,560
Actually, you actually pretty much on point with that.

2687
02:07:39,680 --> 02:07:40,960
An accurate read.

2688
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:41,840
I love it.

2689
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:46,880
Did any other, uh, OLR listeners, people like SSU 100 Mad I Knows in the area, any of the

2690
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:49,840
other New York city people, uh, meet up or just.

2691
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:55,760
No, no, but, uh, JV must have like these monthly raves I keep forgetting to go to.

2692
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:56,000
So.

2693
02:07:57,360 --> 02:07:58,800
I know I keep seeing the pictures.

2694
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:01,760
God, I need to get back to New York city so bad.

2695
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:03,680
I know I've been saying that for like five years, but it's true.

2696
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:05,680
And Alan's never been, and he really wants to go.

2697
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:10,000
Um, I know we're eyeing Toronto for a big trip next year, but New York is definitely

2698
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:10,960
on the agenda as well.

2699
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:15,280
So just if finances work out well, hopefully I can make that happen.

2700
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:19,760
Three days in New York city, four days in Toronto.

2701
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:20,560
That's true.

2702
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:23,280
Make it make a whole travel the world event.

2703
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:23,760
Who knows?

2704
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:25,920
I like the sound of that.

2705
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:26,640
Me too.

2706
02:08:26,640 --> 02:08:30,480
Bobby Blackwell says I've actually never actually been to New York either.

2707
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:35,040
You know, we just need to find a convention to insert ourselves into and try to do some

2708
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:35,680
panels.

2709
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:39,600
Maybe I'll ask around to dragon con, see what they're doing in New York that we may be getting

2710
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:39,760
on.

2711
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:46,160
Oh, I know a lot of conventions coming up and I do keep my ear to them.

2712
02:08:46,160 --> 02:08:50,240
I have been recruited to staff a convention in DC and one panel.

2713
02:08:50,240 --> 02:08:51,440
So we'll see how that goes.

2714
02:08:51,440 --> 02:08:51,920
All right.

2715
02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:52,720
Sounds good.

2716
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:55,920
Well, anything else you want to call it or you want to talk about tonight, my friend?

2717
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:56,880
Yes, actually.

2718
02:08:56,880 --> 02:09:02,400
Now, has it been a game that you have played somewhere down the line and you really enjoyed

2719
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:05,840
this game and you say to yourself, I can't believe I slept on this game.

2720
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:12,880
Um, that's how I felt about mass effects when I finally got into it, honestly, cause I,

2721
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:17,840
I did sleep on that for many years, uh, and then finally came back and, uh, played it

2722
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:20,240
later and I was, uh, in love with it.

2723
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:26,480
Uh, a game that I felt like I slept on and then I finally came back and checked it out

2724
02:09:26,480 --> 02:09:27,600
and I liked it a lot.

2725
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:28,000
Um,

2726
02:09:33,120 --> 02:09:35,680
there's so many games that I check out right at release.

2727
02:09:35,680 --> 02:09:39,040
It's so hard to go back in the archive and visit old things.

2728
02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:42,960
Loki, is there anything for you like where it's like, oh man, I slept on this.

2729
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:44,240
I should have had a better eye on it.

2730
02:09:44,720 --> 02:09:49,280
Um, no.

2731
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:52,080
I mean, I can't think of anything off the top of my head.

2732
02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:54,960
Um, maybe Minecraft a little bit.

2733
02:09:56,720 --> 02:09:57,120
Okay.

2734
02:09:57,120 --> 02:09:58,160
I go with that too.

2735
02:09:58,160 --> 02:09:59,040
Minecraft.

2736
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:00,960
Like what was the big deal?

2737
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:03,120
Uh, over in chat at live.vognetwork.com.

2738
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:05,440
S2 100 Matt says the South Park games.

2739
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:06,560
It's a pretty good answer too.

2740
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:08,480
Well, what about you Rama?

2741
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:09,360
I'm flipping it on you.

2742
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:10,880
What was the game that you wrote off?

2743
02:10:10,880 --> 02:10:15,760
Ah, okay.

2744
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:16,260
Okay.

2745
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:18,080
Ooh, you know what?

2746
02:10:18,080 --> 02:10:24,800
Speaking of like shooty bang bang Pew Pew games, the doom remake would be one where I was like,

2747
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:28,160
I kind of wrote it off as a shooty Pew Pew game, but it's actually a lot of fun.

2748
02:10:28,160 --> 02:10:29,200
I really liked the doom remake.

2749
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:34,080
I played that like really couldn't get into it because I felt like the doom remake was

2750
02:10:34,080 --> 02:10:38,640
like a little bit too, uh, high, high, fast paced for me.

2751
02:10:38,640 --> 02:10:40,640
So I couldn't, you know, get into it as well.

2752
02:10:40,640 --> 02:10:43,200
But the old doom games were super fast paced too.

2753
02:10:43,200 --> 02:10:46,720
So anyway, my friend, I'm going to let you go to see if we can squeeze in any more calls,

2754
02:10:46,720 --> 02:10:47,520
but thanks for the call.

2755
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:48,640
No problem.

2756
02:10:48,640 --> 02:10:49,280
Appreciate it.

2757
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:49,520
Yep.

2758
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:50,720
And check the gain on your mic.

2759
02:10:50,720 --> 02:10:51,120
Trust me.

2760
02:10:51,120 --> 02:10:51,360
All right.

2761
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:51,920
Later buddy.

2762
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:53,200
All right.

2763
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:53,700
Bye.

2764
02:10:54,160 --> 02:10:54,640
All right.

2765
02:10:54,640 --> 02:10:55,920
Uh, let's see.

2766
02:10:55,920 --> 02:10:57,680
Oh, dark to see us as Fortnite.

2767
02:10:58,240 --> 02:11:02,000
I didn't think I'd enjoy it, but from playing the switch version, I've been enjoying it.

2768
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:02,160
Yeah.

2769
02:11:02,160 --> 02:11:05,200
There's hella people that are checking out Fortnite now for the first time on the switch.

2770
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:05,700
It's crazy.

2771
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:08,880
Uh, orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

2772
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:12,080
We'll try to do like a last minute call for calls.

2773
02:11:12,080 --> 02:11:16,640
Uh, meanwhile, uh, I know a lot of folks are talking about the crew too right now.

2774
02:11:16,640 --> 02:11:18,720
I didn't realize the crew too would just come out.

2775
02:11:18,720 --> 02:11:23,440
Yeah, I think, um, I thought they were doing just like beta testing for that.

2776
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:29,600
Uh, FIFA 19 is going to be disclosing the odds on the ultimate team packs.

2777
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:34,080
So you will know what's in those loot boxes or the odds of getting the loot that you want,

2778
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:38,480
which I think is kind of where the industry is kind of forcing things to go.

2779
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:40,320
So I guess that's a good thing.

2780
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:40,720
I don't know.

2781
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:46,720
Anyway, uh, Bobby Black Wolf says, as far as crew two goes, uh, beta testing was last weekend.

2782
02:11:46,720 --> 02:11:48,480
It came out for realsies this week.

2783
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:50,320
The beta testing crashed my router.

2784
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:52,480
So this week I bought a new router.

2785
02:11:52,480 --> 02:11:52,960
Yikes.

2786
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:54,560
That sounds pretty bad.

2787
02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:56,960
I guess I missed that whole beta test cause I was out of town.

2788
02:11:56,960 --> 02:11:58,000
Pretty good excuse, right?

2789
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:03,200
Uh, for those of you that are playing Monster Hunter World, there is a Twilight Fest kicking

2790
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:04,880
off on July 13th.

2791
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:08,080
You know, they're supposed to be having an event in Final Fantasy 14 around Monster Hunter

2792
02:12:08,080 --> 02:12:10,000
as well, but I haven't heard the details on that yet.

2793
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,360
So anyway.

2794
02:12:12,080 --> 02:12:12,400
All right.

2795
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:14,720
Well, sadly, it doesn't look like any more calls are coming in.

2796
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:18,160
So I think we are going to start to wrap up for the night and I've still got these hiccups

2797
02:12:18,160 --> 02:12:20,800
that are just pissing me off.

2798
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:24,880
So we're going to go ahead and start to wrap up here, but, uh, as always, we want to thank

2799
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:26,960
you guys for tuning into Orange Lounge Radio.

2800
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:30,720
And if you like what you heard here, uh, please, uh, tell a friend about the show because we

2801
02:12:30,720 --> 02:12:32,400
are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2802
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:35,840
But, uh, if the voices aren't here to air, we can't air them.

2803
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:39,280
So, uh, we don't have a big million dollar website behind us or anything like that.

2804
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:41,360
It's just us homegrown.

2805
02:12:41,360 --> 02:12:43,120
So a word of mouth goes a long way.

2806
02:12:43,120 --> 02:12:47,200
And you know what, even if you tell your friends, you know, what really helps is a nice five

2807
02:12:47,200 --> 02:12:51,840
star review on iTunes or Google podcasts, which I think they, they, they kind of changed

2808
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:54,480
their podcast app this week.

2809
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:56,000
So a lot of you guys are checking that out again.

2810
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:01,760
So, uh, a nice five star review wherever you found this call or wherever you found this

2811
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:03,520
show would be welcome.

2812
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:04,000
Sorry guys.

2813
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:07,600
I'm trying to push through these hiccups and like, stop, stop picking me.

2814
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:08,160
Stop.

2815
02:13:08,160 --> 02:13:08,560
Anyway.

2816
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:08,880
Yeah.

2817
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:10,320
Scare those hiccups out of you.

2818
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:11,040
What?

2819
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:13,280
Maybe Russia blood blood.

2820
02:13:13,280 --> 02:13:14,160
Hey, Loki.

2821
02:13:14,160 --> 02:13:17,440
I still, I'm still blown away that you got this because I know these things ain't cheap.

2822
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:18,880
So I hope there was a sale or something.

2823
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:20,480
So appreciate it very much.

2824
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:21,520
Assume that there was a sale.

2825
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:21,760
All right.

2826
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:22,240
So, all right.

2827
02:13:22,240 --> 02:13:23,280
We'll assume there was a sale.

2828
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:23,840
All right.

2829
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,920
Uh, thank you guys so much for listening to the show.

2830
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:28,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2831
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,440
Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight.

2832
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Yeah.

2833
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:35,120
Very tempted to go down to Walmart to pick up a SNES classic.

2834
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:37,040
Oh, there you go.

2835
02:13:37,040 --> 02:13:38,640
And you get an NES classic while you're at it.

2836
02:13:38,640 --> 02:13:39,600
Cause those are back in stock.

2837
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:39,760
Yeah.

2838
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:41,120
But Alan ordered me one.

2839
02:13:41,120 --> 02:13:42,000
It's coming on Friday.

2840
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:45,120
If they already, they haven't the Rancho one right now.

2841
02:13:45,120 --> 02:13:45,840
Oh, do they really?

2842
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:47,680
Oh, he, he, he already mail ordered it.

2843
02:13:47,680 --> 02:13:48,560
So we're just waiting on it.

2844
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:52,960
So I mean, he didn't know that they were like being reprinted massively.

2845
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:57,280
So when he saw one at retail price, he was like, I don't know what the fuck's happening,

2846
02:13:57,280 --> 02:13:59,040
but I'm buying one for Rob right now.

2847
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:03,600
So, which, and I've seen the SNES classics and I've keep like holding off on a bit.

2848
02:14:03,600 --> 02:14:06,320
Like my kids today were looking at like super Nintendo games.

2849
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:08,160
Look at new Mario game.

2850
02:14:08,160 --> 02:14:10,080
Like, no, that's an old Mario game.

2851
02:14:10,080 --> 02:14:11,280
Look at Toy Story game.

2852
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:13,120
No, that's an old Toy Story game.

2853
02:14:13,120 --> 02:14:15,760
So I'm like, you know, I could just get one of these.

2854
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:18,880
You and I have a raspberry PI, you know, I could really just do a raspberry pilot.

2855
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:23,120
I liked the controller and that's the other thing.

2856
02:14:23,120 --> 02:14:28,000
She was like, I would get an NES classic, but I can just fucking mod the SNES classic

2857
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,280
to put the NES games on there.

2858
02:14:29,280 --> 02:14:30,720
So there's really no point.

2859
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:31,840
All right.

2860
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:33,600
So I'm trying to do that.

2861
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:39,200
And my final thought is I get to play Tetris attack in VR and I'm or Tetris effect in VR.

2862
02:14:39,200 --> 02:14:42,080
And I'm so happy in a few months, in a few months.

2863
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:43,840
Yeah, I don't get to do it tonight, but in a few months.

2864
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:45,600
So in the meantime, I have rez.

2865
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:50,000
I have until dawn rush of blood and I have Skyrim VR, which I really want to check out

2866
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:50,640
because I hope I can.

2867
02:14:50,640 --> 02:14:51,920
I still haven't checked it out yet.

2868
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:53,600
I bought it, but I haven't played it yet.

2869
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:56,960
But it'll be interesting.

2870
02:14:56,960 --> 02:15:00,400
I don't know if that's necessarily the best VR game, but it's Skyrim.

2871
02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:00,880
It's fun.

2872
02:15:01,680 --> 02:15:02,000
All right.

2873
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:02,640
But check out.

2874
02:15:02,640 --> 02:15:07,280
Yeah, the demo disc and definitely like Job Simulator.

2875
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:08,880
Those are pretty fun, of course.

2876
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:10,560
Or actually Job Simulator.

2877
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:14,000
It can get a little boring because it's a little kitty, but like accounting plus.

2878
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:14,560
All right.

2879
02:15:14,560 --> 02:15:16,160
Or I want to try.

2880
02:15:16,160 --> 02:15:16,880
I just picked it up.

2881
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:20,320
I want to really want to try just in time make because that looks hilarious.

2882
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:22,320
It's overly violent, but cute.

2883
02:15:23,280 --> 02:15:26,080
And so like they have like scenarios.

2884
02:15:26,080 --> 02:15:28,960
Like, for example, there's one that there's a grandma in the middle.

2885
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:32,720
She's like with her walker and stuff, and there's a whole bunch of knife wielding murderers

2886
02:15:32,720 --> 02:15:33,920
are trying to kill her.

2887
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:37,600
And you have to kill them while everything's moving slow.

2888
02:15:37,600 --> 02:15:38,720
And it's hilarious.

2889
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:39,200
All right.

2890
02:15:39,200 --> 02:15:43,520
I have to get on the PlayStation store and check out all these games that they have now

2891
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:44,320
that I can actually play.

2892
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:45,360
All right.

2893
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:46,560
That's going to do it for another episode.

2894
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:47,280
Orange, Andrea.

2895
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:49,200
My other final thought is fuck hiccups.

2896
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:50,640
This is the worst thing in the world.

2897
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:52,640
We'll be back in seven days to do it all over again.

2898
02:15:52,640 --> 02:15:57,440
Hopefully with less hiccups and more gaming news and more of you guys live and on our
