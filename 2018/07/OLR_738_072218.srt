Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's the year of the remaster, the year of the Switch port, the year of the vinyl soundtrack, the year of the battle royale, another year of Mega Man Classic, and the year of the doll.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm a year older, as was this show last month. Stay tuned for all this year's news, or at least this week's, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio live tonight.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Episode number 738 for this July 22nd of 2018. Here to talk about video games with y'all assembled in our live chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But you podcast folks out there can participate with us as well throughout the week, through your emails, your tweets, and so forth.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But tonight here in studio, it's me, Rob Roberts, or Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E, joined as always by DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You could go Skie!

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Actually, I'm giving serious thought to changing my Twitter name off of Skie, just because I don't really use that name at all.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The reason why that name comes from, like DDR Freak, like years ago, but I don't really use that name anywhere anymore.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So, you know, because of things like this show that started after the DDR Freak days, or during really, I think people just know me online as Rob Roberts at this point.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So, you know, I probably should have some type of...

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
JD says don't do it because four-letter usernames on Twitter are rare.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That is true. I think if I do switch it, I will probably keep a sock account.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Because the name I really want is Rob Roberts, but a spammer has it.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So my thought is I'm going to hold the Skie account hostage until Rob Roberts is released.

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's my Twitter thinking right now.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm always going to keep DarkSakura because people hate me for it.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Why?

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Like complete strangers.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You've got the name I want!

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Good!

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
On Twitter, aren't you underscore O-L-R?

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
No.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No? Okay.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I couldn't remember.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm DarkSakura there because I made that account when Twitter was new.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah, we all got on Twitter pretty quick.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Because, well, if you think a four-letter account is rare, follow the show on Twitter, O-L-R.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We have a three-letter account there and we constantly get tweets for like other things.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's pretty funny.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Fuck off.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,320
But I still, though my other one Kuro Tsubasa is, I decided because I actually was spelling

39
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,000
Kuro incorrectly for black, it just means crowing.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Works.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,240
Sorry about last week.

44
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,240
We weren't here last week and that was completely my fault.

45
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,180
Without getting into all the gory details, I had food poisoning.

46
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,180
It was awful.

47
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,180
Y'all have been there.

48
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,960
I don't need to say anything else about it.

49
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
But I'm fine now.

50
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:07,360
Like most episodes of that sort of thing, by the time 48 hours had passed, it was like

51
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,560
nothing had ever happened.

52
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,680
So it's just unfortunate that fell on Sunday night because I hate missing episodes.

53
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,120
I hate not being here for y'all.

54
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,000
But I know you all are understanding very much as well and I hope you found some other

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,500
good indie shows to listen to last Sunday night or maybe some Twitch streamers and probably

56
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,700
played some games.

57
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,260
I know there's a lot of you playing a lot of different games right now.

58
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,020
We'll get into some of those during our gaming weeks in a minute, but I also have to introduce,

59
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,860
of course, Techmaster Loki.

60
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,860
How are you, Loki?

61
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,860
I'm fine.

62
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,860
Good.

63
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,020
I had a mediocre sandwich from Subway.

64
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,980
Yeah, well, Subway sandwiches tend to be pretty mediocre, but that's just my opinion.

65
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,340
I should have just gone with the one that's by my work because they know what I want there

66
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,340
and they don't even, they're like, you just have the same thing as normal?

67
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,340
Yeah.

68
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,340
It comes out perfect.

69
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:58,060
Like this one was just like 80% bread and like nothing and she just like slapped everything

70
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,260
on there and it's just, I could tell she was making like, this is going to be terrible.

71
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,740
Is it the Subway right near here?

72
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,740
Cause they're really bad.

73
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,780
No, it's the one right off the freeway by my house.

74
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,780
Okay.

75
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,780
Okay.

76
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,780
Oh yeah.

77
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,780
I made a last minute change in what I wanted to get.

78
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:17,620
And I got, I went originally into Cafe Rio and then I was like, I'm confused at the calories

79
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:24,260
of all the chips and salsa they eat on there because the online, it says it's 440 calories

80
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,260
on their menu board.

81
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,260
It says it's 1,340 calories.

82
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,380
So I'm like, that's a big discrepancy.

83
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,380
Depends how much you eat.

84
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,380
I suppose.

85
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,100
Um, that subway, I think that you're talking about is right by where I used to work and

86
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,460
without giving away my whole life story here, but that used to be a Quiznos when it first

87
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,460
opened.

88
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,460
Oh man.

89
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,460
Can you say downgrade?

90
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,460
I would rather be a Quiznos.

91
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,460
Are there any of those still around?

92
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,460
No, I miss those.

93
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,460
Those are good anyway.

94
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,940
We used to have one right around the corner from my house and I used to go there all the

95
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,940
time.

96
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,700
Meanwhile, while the rest of you are mourning Toys R Us and shit.

97
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,380
I'm sitting here going, I miss my Quiznos sandwich.

98
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,460
My toasted sandwiches.

99
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,500
I, I'm like the only person that loved that toasted thing.

100
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,620
Everybody else is like, it was good, but then they'll toast it.

101
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,620
Subway stolen.

102
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,380
You give it subway though.

103
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,540
You toast their sandwich and it's still, it's still garbage toasted a sandwich like you

104
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,100
would like you would bake a pizza.

105
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,620
It went through that slow conveyor belt.

106
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,420
It was all, yeah, it like it was good and like they put like, you know, I'd get a steak

107
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:25,020
sandwich and I had, you know, the Rosemary Parmesan bread with the nice sauce and like

108
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,740
drool and the onions and everything and then come through and you're just like, I don't

109
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,860
need you to do anything that sandwiches cut in half and it's ready to go.

110
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,300
It's just, it's perfect, but that is beautiful.

111
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,900
The problem is it was like I take that sandwich and I go to subway and there is no amount

112
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,940
of sandwich that they could give me that would equal to that sandwich.

113
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,500
It's just, it's not the same.

114
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,460
So I, yeah, it's unfortunate.

115
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,460
All right.

116
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,700
Uh, enough food talk, but it wouldn't be OLR if we didn't deviate into food talk at some

117
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,700
point.

118
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,380
So now we get into our kickoff topic, which as we usually do after a week off is getting

119
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,820
into what we missed the week before.

120
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,340
But um, let me quickly ask, did you guys do anything with the extra time on Sunday since

121
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,540
I know, I saw her, I had to do it kind of last minute, but y'all know how it is.

122
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,500
So did you guys get to do anything fun with your extra unexpected Sunday night off?

123
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,260
I played Pokemon go and saw ant man and wasp.

124
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,260
Okay, cool.

125
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,640
I figured, I figured some Pokemon go might happen.

126
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,620
I stayed in my pajama, not wearing any pants.

127
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,620
Nice.

128
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,460
And then watched, uh, like videos on a YouTube fan fell down a YouTube hole.

129
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,880
That's, that's always a fun way to waste the same thing yesterday is great because I had

130
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:40,880
an unexpected Saturday off because my schedule, my work, our schedules are start on Saturday.

131
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,740
So because I'm now on a training schedule for another department, yes, um, I had yesterday

132
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,740
off.

133
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,740
Nice.

134
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,740
And that's why I get to be for a whole show just about tonight.

135
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,860
Yay.

136
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,860
Exciting.

137
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,860
All right.

138
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,620
Uh, let's get into some of the topics for the show.

139
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,460
So let's talk about some of the news that we missed last week when we were unexpectedly

140
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,460
off.

141
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,620
So, uh, talking about some Nintendo news, um, apparently, uh, Nintendo had made a comment

142
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,820
about they're not yet at the point where they can announce the entire product lineup for

143
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,820
the autumn.

144
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,140
That was a quote that came out, which seems very strange because autumn is exactly not

145
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,140
that far away.

146
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,140
Now.

147
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,860
We talked about this a little bit at the tail end of Bobby black will show on the call.

148
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,900
I do want to repeat a little bit of it.

149
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,460
Usually I would just tell you, you need to go listen to it to hear it.

150
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,580
But I think part of what we discussed there was really important.

151
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,060
I do need to repeat it.

152
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,940
Um, because my theory on this whole, why Nintendo is waiting forever on this online thing is

153
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:40,020
that I think Nintendo is really pushing to get something really big out.

154
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,360
That's going to be digital only.

155
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,820
So and I, I think I talked about last show we were here.

156
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,300
I thought something like NES remix, but maybe bigger, something that's going to be download

157
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,940
only that is going to be a big flagship thing for the online service and that they're really

158
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,100
trying to push to get that out.

159
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,860
And actually dark soccer, you said animal crossing, um, as kind of like an offhanded

160
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,860
comment.

161
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,660
And I was kind of like, well, I don't know if it would be that big, but at the same time,

162
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,640
I don't necessarily think that's a, that's a completely off base projection, you know,

163
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,140
because I would think animal crossing is something that maybe deserves a retail release in a

164
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:18,860
box, but animal cross crossing would also make a really great, like online only download

165
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,860
type of thing.

166
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,660
So I don't hate that idea actually at all.

167
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,420
I'd like an animal crossing MMO and that, and that could be something that, you know,

168
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,420
is pushing the online.

169
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,100
Anyway, my point is with this whole thing, whatever it is that they're working, because

170
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,540
I don't want to get people's hopes up either.

171
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,680
Oh, it's animal crossing.

172
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
Maybe not.

173
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,100
It could be, you know, again, think along the lines of NES remix, something you just

174
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,380
haven't thought of yet.

175
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,940
But my thought is that they are really aggressively trying to get that out by October, but right

176
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,740
now Nintendo is in a phase where they're not sure if they're going to make it.

177
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,220
So if they don't make it, then expect that Nintendo direct to be, Oh, it's the online

178
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,100
classics and some little things.

179
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,620
And we're all going to be sitting here going, that's it.

180
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,740
That's what we were waiting for.

181
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,500
But the hype of playing classics online will be kind of cool.

182
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,780
But if Nintendo is able to make the timeline, then we'll get something really big.

183
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,700
But if they miss October, obviously this big thing would just slip into 2019.

184
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,700
We'd get it eventually.

185
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,700
I'd be more curious.

186
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,540
So which games are actually going to use online services because the, how many online, there's

187
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,220
all a whole ton of online games.

188
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,620
I think I'm well, Splatoon two and a smash brothers obviously going to be the huge one

189
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,940
smash brothers when they're expecting everybody to use rocket league and Mario Kart eight

190
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,940
is on card eight.

191
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,940
Maybe a Fortnite.

192
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,940
Fortnite.

193
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,940
Absolutely.

194
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,940
Fortnite.

195
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,940
Yeah.

196
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,260
So, um, yeah, there's, if you really sit down, I mean, maybe not Zelda, breath of the wild

197
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,980
and Mario Odyssey so much, although Mario Odyssey does have the online leaderboards,

198
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,380
but um, you know, maybe not that stuff so much, but there's a fair amount of Nintendo

199
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,400
houses that are using the online.

200
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,660
So anyway, um, some other things that we missed while we were gone.

201
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,940
Speaking of Splatoon two, there was a big, uh, 3.2 0 update with some bug fixes and some

202
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,580
weapon and sub tweaks, uh, that happened.

203
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,660
Uh, let's see the eighties arcade platformer Toki is getting a switch release and a wooden

204
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,540
arcade cabinet to go with that.

205
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,540
Hmm.

206
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,500
Uh, Reggie Fils-Aime talked about the super Mario movie and potential other partnerships.

207
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,500
Uh, in an interview with IGN, he said quotes like, certainly our focus from a Nintendo

208
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,380
perspective as well as working with such an accomplished partner like illumination is

209
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,300
to make sure that what is created is something both fans will love as well as it will be

210
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,020
a great introduction to folks who are not as familiar with the world of Mario.

211
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,060
So most of that is smoke and mirrors, hype chat, but the interesting part of that to

212
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:36,180
me is that they are making a movie that is geared towards people who may not know who

213
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:46,080
Mario is, which to me at this point, who doesn't know who Mario is like everybody, especially

214
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,620
our age and younger knows who Mario is.

215
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,940
Even most folks, probably about 10 years older than us, you know, so we're talking about

216
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,540
like maybe when you start to get to like the 65 and older, they don't, that's all my kids

217
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:04,220
do is they watch, I literally, my kids watch super Mario Odyssey playthroughs all the

218
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,220
time.

219
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,260
I'm like, I asked him once, I'm like, why though?

220
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,320
Cause you beat the game.

221
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,340
So why are you watching people play the game?

222
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,580
I'm like, that doesn't make any sense.

223
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,500
But my youngest son who's not very good at the game, he's just watching people play the

224
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,980
game and yeah, I really can't say anything about that cause that's all I do on Twitch.

225
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,980
I watch people play games.

226
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,500
Are they watching Mario marathon?

227
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,980
No, they're watching just Mario Odyssey.

228
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,780
They want random YouTubers, whoever comes up in the YouTube kids apps, which I don't

229
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:34,580
even know how it picks up Mario Odyssey cause I don't think that they're actually typing

230
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,580
anything in.

231
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,620
That's the, that's the YouTube market I should have aimed for to try to get more people to

232
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,820
actually subscribe to my channel so I could, you know, like actually make money on Twitch

233
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,340
is like, I should do play throughs aimed at kids and use crazy voices.

234
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,940
No, it's not the crazy voices or anything.

235
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,980
It's literally just the game that they're playing.

236
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,680
It's not a YouTube app.

237
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:03,100
It's just basically if you have to think dumber because no, no, I'm not saying that kids are

238
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,100
dumb.

239
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,540
I'm saying they don't like at that age, they don't know how to read.

240
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,340
They don't like, my son doesn't know how to read.

241
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,660
I mean he can sometimes recognize stuff, but he doesn't know how to read.

242
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,460
He goes off pictures and so sure, you know, he likes Mario Odyssey because you know, his

243
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,980
brother plays it and I play it and he liked, he plays it too.

244
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,420
And he sees a picture, Oh, Mario brothers and clicks on the picture and then that's

245
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,420
it.

246
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,400
He can't be a streamer in another language.

247
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,660
He doesn't, he can't understand a thing they're saying, but he's watching it because it's

248
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,420
Mario and then he wants to watch Mario.

249
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,420
Okay.

250
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,140
But I mean, I feel like you told this exact same story a year ago, but it was Minecraft.

251
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,780
Well, they still do that.

252
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,400
In fact, my son went back to pop.

253
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,020
He's still watching popular MMOs, which is a mine craft.

254
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,740
Uh, you know, it's a pair of streamers that will do Minecraft stuff.

255
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,060
And so he's, he's totally watching that.

256
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,660
And then my, my kids like keeps talking, talking about hello neighbor and stuff.

257
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,100
How do you know about these games?

258
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,980
Like in five nights at Freddy's and stuff like that.

259
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,300
I'm like, where are you watching this stuff?

260
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,740
So okay, before I let this go though, let me ask you guys and asking the, uh, chatters.

261
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,740
Okay.

262
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:13,740
So instead of Mr. Rogers neighborhood, Mr. Robert's neighborhood and it's video games,

263
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,960
you better teach them about love and that they're special.

264
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,340
I would, I would at the end of the day, I don't know, man.

265
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,960
And I would say, you know, don't bully the other kids.

266
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
Don't be an asshole.

267
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
Like your older boy.

268
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,800
I guess I can't say that there's a fine line between, between coming off as a pedophile

269
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
and coming off.

270
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,920
And you are also not a Presbyterian minister, Rob.

271
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,920
Just saying.

272
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,820
Well, I mean I could join like the universal Unitarian or whatever that thing is.

273
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,820
You just pay 30 bucks.

274
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,820
Unicornian.

275
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,820
Unicornian.

276
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,820
Sure.

277
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,820
That works.

278
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,820
I like unicorns.

279
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,600
In this way.

280
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,080
Where's that Twitter meme in this house?

281
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,560
We worship unicorns.

282
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,560
That's it.

283
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,880
Cause then we could get like a tax break.

284
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,880
I'm serious.

285
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,560
Let's, let's form the unicornian church.

286
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,560
All right.

287
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,560
I'm, I'm thinking about it.

288
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,240
I don't have to, I have to look into that.

289
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
Yeah.

290
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,200
In Alabama, there's the church of the great green frog.

291
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Sorry.

292
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
They're Mississippi.

293
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
Uh, flying speed.

294
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
The great green hippo toad.

295
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,000
They give you a get out of hell free card at conventions.

296
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I have one somewhere.

297
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
All right.

298
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Anyway.

299
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Come in handy.

300
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,500
JD said it's the universal life church.

301
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,600
It's the one where you pay a fee and can marry people.

302
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:25,320
Some, I actually almost was going to do that for a friend's wedding.

303
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,160
But then they ended up, they were like, actually, we're going to have to like scale this whole

304
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,560
thing back into a courthouse wedding.

305
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,240
And I was like, all right, you got to do what you got to do.

306
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,920
But yeah, because I remember starting to go through the motions for that.

307
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,200
So I, yeah, Rob Roberts, a future minister, if you want to Rob Roberts wedding, Mr. Roberts

308
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
neighborhood.

309
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Anyway.

310
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,000
Uh, Reggie, Reverend Robert's neighborhood, Reverend Roberts.

311
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,640
Oh my God.

312
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,560
I sound like, Oh God, I sound like the type of Reverend Robert sounds like I ought to

313
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,560
be like a gun owner.

314
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,560
Actually.

315
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,040
I think if you like Google Rob Roberts, like you don't always get me, but I think you get

316
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,260
like a gun guy.

317
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,240
And I'm like, Jesus, of course, of course, the most popular Rob Roberts is probably like

318
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
a gun guy.

319
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,240
All right.

320
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
Anyway.

321
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
Um, moving on.

322
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,640
Um, other partnerships, the quote from Reggie, we see ourselves as making a worldwide consumers

323
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,480
smile through our intellectual property.

324
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,900
Fundamentally, we do that four ways.

325
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,800
We do a mobile, do you, uh, we do it with our licensed relationship with other companies

326
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,860
like Kellogg's.

327
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,060
We have other entertainment, which is where we put universal studios and illumination.

328
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,060
Then we have our dedicated video game business.

329
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,620
This is a key part of our strategy.

330
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,500
This is an area where we are having a range of conversations, just like we did for the

331
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,280
other big two partnerships.

332
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,780
When we have something to announce, we will.

333
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:43,020
So maybe there will be other very large Nintendo partnerships to come in the future.

334
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,020
Who knows?

335
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:49,540
Uh, more news that we missed on the week off, uh, job listings at Sony talking about an

336
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,580
unannounced PS4 and PC MMORPG.

337
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,660
So could that be a Sony online entertainment game?

338
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:03,260
Could that be like EverQuest three or something or DC universe two or, I mean, something new

339
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,380
would always be a great thing too, but certainly gets the head spinning on that.

340
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,980
Also other games, a PS4 arcade robot action game, a PS4 strategy, RPG, and a multi-platform

341
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,780
3d fighting action game.

342
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,380
I like robots and action.

343
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,380
That's true.

344
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,380
Robots and action.

345
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,380
Good things.

346
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,380
Uh, let's see.

347
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,380
Other things.

348
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,380
Robots in disguise.

349
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,740
Um, it's always sunny in Philadelphia, the TV show, which I'm surprised is actually still

350
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,740
on.

351
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,740
That's not an almost.

352
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,740
So I think they're almost done.

353
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,180
I was like, that's not a dig.

354
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,460
That show is really funny, but it's been on a really long, it's the 13th season.

355
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:40,340
Like they're all going to be as old as Danny DeVito was when it started.

356
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,340
You know what I mean?

357
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,020
Anyway, uh, they're, they're getting a mobile game out of that.

358
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,020
It's always sunny in Philadelphia.

359
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,020
So yes.

360
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,260
And I will play that mobile game.

361
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,260
It's going to be garbage.

362
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,180
It's just going to be like the office space game I have, but I will play that game.

363
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,800
I have actually stopped playing the office space game, but I will totally play the it's

364
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,660
always sunny in Philadelphia game.

365
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,740
Uh, the company mono or mondo, excuse me.

366
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,620
Uh, this might be a winter star Sakura mondo is releasing a vinyl soundtrack for Dracula

367
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,420
X Rondo of blood.

368
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,540
I need this in my life.

369
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,100
That's something, I guess they had some at San Diego comic con.

370
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,460
So why isn't somebody getting me one, but I guess there will be an actual release of

371
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,460
this later.

372
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,900
I will have it and I will frame it because I don't have a record player.

373
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,340
I thought you might enjoy that.

374
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,380
Uh, also Shenmue one and two HD going to have some changes.

375
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,220
The brand of products will be gone.

376
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,700
I'm sure that's no surprise to anyone.

377
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,860
Those, you know, brand partnerships are long gone and the load times will be cut.

378
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,860
Well that's good.

379
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,460
No, my long load times.

380
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,340
God damn it.

381
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,340
I hate the future.

382
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,100
I'm going to miss those.

383
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,660
Remember back in the good old days where you'd have to load star comma eight comma one and

384
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,740
then you have to sit there while it loads for 10 minutes off one side and then flip

385
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,420
the disc over and it's got to load off the other side.

386
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,420
Why can't we have that?

387
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,940
How many, but Rob, how many terabytes was that?

388
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,980
Oh, it was one megabyte or not even.

389
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,980
It was okay.

390
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,980
Loki.

391
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,980
It was a Commodore.

392
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,980
No, hold on.

393
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
64.

394
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
64 kilobytes.

395
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,660
Apple two E. Same code to run the damn games.

396
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,500
And I was good at kicks.

397
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:26,100
Uh, anyway, um, so a street fighter 30th anniversary collection international got a new trailer

398
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,100
and a release date.

399
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,900
So the Japanese version will have the localized versions and the different names of the bosses

400
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,460
in Japanese text.

401
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,940
So Capcom giving into the fan demands there, which is a good thing.

402
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,940
I really think.

403
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,860
Uh, and there will be an official guide for mega man 11, which is notable.

404
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,940
It's the first mega man guide since 2006.

405
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,180
So there you go.

406
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:53,200
That's a little bit about what you missed last week when we had the night off with OLR.

407
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,660
Let's talk a little bit about what we've been up to this week and maybe a little last week

408
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,860
too in our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing.

409
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,860
Dark soccer.

410
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,860
How about you?

411
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:09,940
Um, Kirby and then watching Mario marathon and then playing a Pokemon go because I feel

412
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,020
bad that I'm not giving gifts to everybody.

413
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:17,260
So I actually travel outside of my neighborhood to go hit pokey stops in my car driving under

414
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,560
20 miles an hour.

415
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,220
I see that as a good thing and a bad thing.

416
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,220
You know what I mean?

417
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,260
It's a good thing cause it motivates you to get out of the house.

418
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,260
It's the Pokemon.

419
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,820
Pokemon go does not let me live my hikikomori a fantasy, but at the same time I think you

420
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,180
have to like let that obligation go a little bit.

421
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,680
Like Jamie, if I'm gonna tell you right now, if you forget to send me a present one day,

422
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,680
it's okay.

423
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,100
Did you haven't opened my present for three days?

424
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,220
I can't.

425
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,300
I can't.

426
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,300
You did it today.

427
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,300
So I forgive you.

428
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,300
Okay.

429
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,300
Okay.

430
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,500
Um, but I'm just saying, you know, it's, you know, I, I, I remember to take it out a little

431
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,900
bit more often when I'm out and about like, you know, when I was at my delicious Thai

432
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,900
lunch, we were by two pokey stops.

433
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,500
So I did gyms.

434
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:05,940
I raided by myself when I went to a certain market that someone told me had those chocolates

435
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,620
that I like and I spent way too much money there.

436
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,620
My bad.

437
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,620
Right.

438
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:18,960
Um, and then, um, I don't know, I've just been kinda sitting back.

439
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,360
I want to, um, actually hook up my steam link cause well, I actually don't think it's going

440
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,460
to work in the room that we've moved our CRT to cause we hooked up the CRT in the office

441
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,140
so that I can start streaming, um, stuff off the SNES.

442
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,140
Nice.

443
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:37,580
Um, but I'm actually considering because, and I'm not, but I'm actually considering

444
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:42,220
streaming games that I don't want to play if people will donate to my GoFundMe for my

445
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,860
mom cause she got fired from her job, which we're pretty sure has to do with age and gender

446
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:53,140
discrimination cause it's Alabama, which is a right to work state, which is just completely

447
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,140
terrible.

448
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,140
There's no protection.

449
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:01,220
They actually broke some very things that would actually have their HR sued out here.

450
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,380
They just flat out told her some garbage.

451
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,940
So, um, so I've got to keep my mom in her home for three more months until she gets

452
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,940
her widow benefits.

453
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:14,020
So if you want to see me play shit, I hate halo is halo on the table.

454
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,620
Halo's on the table, but I'd have to play it over here so I'd come over on a Friday

455
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,620
night.

456
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,620
We'll figure it out.

457
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,620
We'll make it work.

458
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,620
Okay.

459
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,620
Shoot.

460
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,500
I might figure out how to get everything up and running.

461
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
All right.

462
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Get that going.

463
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,780
I'll put the minute they see you up there streaming stuff, they'll, they'll be more

464
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,380
inclined to make you play bad stuff.

465
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,380
We'll see.

466
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,380
Oh, I don't know.

467
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:41,980
I'm planning on playing, uh, the, uh, hive swap, um, dating SIM cause I've picked up

468
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,460
all eight episodes of it last night cause I like dating Sims.

469
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,700
I'm trying to think what terrible game I really want Jamie to play.

470
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,220
I got to really like stew on this for a little bit anyway.

471
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,220
All right.

472
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,940
Other games in our gaming week, Loki, how about you?

473
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,900
Um, well this week I went ahead cause they had the whole Amazon prime days thing.

474
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,940
So we decided to get a 4k TV.

475
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,980
So we got a 4k TV and then of course to go along with it, I picked it, I traded in my

476
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,180
PlayStation four for a PlayStation four pro.

477
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:18,480
And so now I have that hooked up and I picked up, um, I think of horizon zero dawn to play

478
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
that.

479
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:25,720
The problem though is because I have a 4k TV, the kids want to play Disney infinity

480
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:32,200
on it just for no reason, even though that doesn't benefit from 4k or the pro at all.

481
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,160
And then my wife keeps watching house on it because you know, because you know, house

482
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:43,120
is just such a current and you know, a current show we haven't watched already, but whatever.

483
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,520
So I have literally gotten the play horizon zero.

484
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,560
I actually haven't gotten the play horizon zero dawn.

485
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:54,020
I got to watch part of the intro before the kids like, Oh my fucking God, I just want

486
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,400
to see what the 4k looks like already.

487
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,520
So unfortunately I haven't got to touch much in console gaming this week.

488
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,000
Um, it's mostly been Pokemon go.

489
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,360
Um, and even I'm kind of disappointed, so I haven't even got to play my SNES classic

490
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,800
very much, even though I've modded the hell out of that.

491
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,960
Um, because once again, I haven't been able to touch the TV.

492
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:22,640
Um, what I have been doing in place of playing games on TV is I've been, I don't know what

493
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,840
prompted me to do this.

494
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,560
I think I was looking, Oh, I remember now cause I wanted to do like, start working on

495
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,840
a third person shooter to create a third person shooter.

496
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:38,600
And I was kind of disappointed with what was available for unity and kind of some of the

497
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:44,520
template, not really templates, but like some of the like lessons or whatever to kind of

498
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,760
roll your own third person shooter engine type thing.

499
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,680
And it just was not looking great.

500
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,060
So I decided, Hey, you know what, maybe I should just work outside of unity and look

501
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,340
at some other engines.

502
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:59,660
So I've been teaching myself unreal four, um, this week and actually actually this weekend

503
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,840
last week.

504
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,160
And so I've been going through some stuff in that and I really like how the engine kind

505
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,080
of makes things a little bit easier to make it look nice.

506
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,040
And they have a lot of presets for, you know, doing a first person shooter or third person

507
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,000
shooter game and all that kind of stuff because that's what the engines for.

508
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,240
So it makes sense.

509
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,640
Um, so I haven't really gotten into the programming yet.

510
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,000
I've been actually teaching myself the blueprint stuff in the meantime, which it's a little

511
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
bit getting used to because I, you know, I like sometimes just being able to type stuff

512
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,640
in there instead of having to do all this arbitrary linking of stuff.

513
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,480
But I still, I like it.

514
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,560
It's still pretty easy.

515
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,280
Um, and I was messing around with it and you know, was able to build things that look nice.

516
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,000
So, um, I do have something I'm working on that will be done probably this week.

517
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,940
So it just like as a, you know, finish something just to learn type thing.

518
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,360
So there's that.

519
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,840
Then once I finished them, I can say, shut the fuck up about me finishing something cause

520
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,840
it's done.

521
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,840
See, there you go.

522
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,840
Aaron, fuck off.

523
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,840
Yeah.

524
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,360
But I'm hoping to learn a little bit more with that cause I think actually this might

525
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,240
be a better option than unity for me cause it seems that I don't know, I'll have to figure

526
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,400
out what the strengths and weaknesses are.

527
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,480
And today of course, you know, I'm a terrible, terrible, terrible game developer and the

528
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,840
fact that I never use version control, uh, or source control or whatever.

529
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,120
So I had to teach myself how to use, um, those behaviors bite you in the ass.

530
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,120
Yeah.

531
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:31,000
So I had to, I had to teach myself how to use source tree and get bucket today, um,

532
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
bit buckets.

533
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,240
So finally got that to work.

534
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,680
Um, because even the lessons that I'm following, um, what they said to do didn't work.

535
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,040
So I had to figure it out myself through the terminal and I finally got that to work.

536
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,600
But yes, I have source control now.

537
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,800
So that, that's great.

538
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,160
I'm, I'm doing all the right things.

539
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,720
Uh, our pal Bobby Black Wolf says, I honestly think the blueprint stuff in UE4 will be better

540
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
for Loki.

541
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,720
It is.

542
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,360
And I, but I do want to learn the C plus plus stuff as well.

543
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:03,960
But um, honestly, I don't think that there's really any downside to using the blueprint

544
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:10,120
stuff because I optimization wise, it's about the same where it's like in unity, it can

545
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
get fun.

546
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,080
And it's just like even getting stuff to look nice and unity is such a pain in the ass.

547
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,500
Whereas unreal is just fucking gorgeous out the, I mean you can make crap and it looks,

548
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,200
it's so amazing looking crap.

549
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,480
I mean, I just, I like how easy that is.

550
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,340
So I'm curious to see how this will go.

551
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:32,200
So I'm optimistic, but I've been, I've been, see, I've been working on stuff.

552
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
All right.

553
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Haven't haven't let go of it.

554
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,800
I do want to play some 4k gaming and I want to try the PlayStation VR now that I've got

555
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:45,160
something that'll, you know, output better, but I don't know, we'll just have to wait

556
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,160
and see.

557
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
All right.

558
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,240
Uh, my gaming week, uh, let's see, I've been playing Pokemon go as well.

559
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,240
Why not?

560
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
I'll just add onto that.

561
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,840
I participated in the Zapdos day yesterday for a little bit.

562
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,400
I had a rehearsal for a, which I guess I should give a cheap plug.

563
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,280
Clue is finally happening this Saturday, uh, here in Sacramento at the colonial theater.

564
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,280
So that's the big thing I've been preparing for.

565
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,080
So we had a rehearsal, so I couldn't do the Zapdos the entire time, but I was able to

566
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,000
do the first two hours.

567
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,040
And in that time we rated like 10 different things and I did get a shiny Zapdos.

568
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,480
So it was like one of the lowest possible appraisals, but eh, I'll take it.

569
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,480
It was fun.

570
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,520
So, um, yeah, just trying to keep getting XP.

571
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,540
Speaking of getting XP, I should mention this too.

572
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:30,740
So not Pokemon go, but Niantic's other game, Ingress, um, I hit level 16 on, congratulations.

573
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,420
That is a big pain in the ass.

574
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,260
I hit the maximum possible level you can hit in that game.

575
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:40,260
So it's, it's similar to being 40 and Pokemon go, but obviously they're different games.

576
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:45,580
So, uh, I actually, I, I, so they kind of had an event going on.

577
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,820
It just finished like two hours ago, but Niantic was like buffing the experience for portal

578
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,440
deploys.

579
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,480
And so I was really able to use that to my advantage, um, by going down and like to the

580
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,880
capital and stuff and deploying.

581
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,000
So I actually, uh, timed it so that my last, uh, the thing that got me level 16 is I deployed

582
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,160
on the state capital, a reso one and a reso six, and that gave me a level 16 and yeah,

583
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,160
super nerdy.

584
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,160
Right.

585
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
So, uh, but that was cool.

586
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,160
So a big accomplishment.

587
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:18,520
So, um, I wanted to be one of the first players that got to 1640.

588
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,480
So level 16 in ingress and level 40 in Pokemon go.

589
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,480
But one of my buddies here locally, uh, from both those games actually just, he just hit

590
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,480
40 and Pokemon go this past week.

591
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,280
And so it made him the first player in Sacramento.

592
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,280
Who's a 1640.

593
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,760
So that's, so I hope to follow in his footsteps.

594
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,960
Uh, that's, I'll probably be, I'm still waiting to level up from whatever level I'm at.

595
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,040
Cause I'm already like 2 million over the cap.

596
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
Oh yeah.

597
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,040
It's like a badge.

598
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,040
You're locked in with bad.

599
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,040
Yeah.

600
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,040
I'm locked in with badges.

601
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
So, and yeah, I just don't care.

602
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,280
It eventually will come, which is, yeah.

603
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,280
When it's ready.

604
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,480
Um, so anyway, so yeah, that was my AR gaming.

605
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,960
And then when the Harry Potter game comes out, I'm going to try to get max level in

606
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,960
that.

607
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,880
Assuming the game is as good as, you know, ingress and Pokemon go here about the new

608
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,880
update.

609
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,880
They have like new updates coming.

610
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,660
Well, obviously you always have new updates coming for Pokemon go, but they've got some

611
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,280
new like lucky Pokemon now.

612
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,280
Yeah.

613
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,680
I heard about this thing that, um, I guess the latest version of date, cause they're

614
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,880
implementing the Celebi quest are probably going to go live next week or the rest of

615
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,880
us.

616
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,780
Uh, Shane got his when he went to go fest.

617
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,460
So, but the rest of us get to get a Celebi soon, um, which, Oh, the speaking of Shane

618
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,060
going to go fest, he brought me back a Torco tour.

619
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,060
Is that a Torco?

620
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,060
Yeah.

621
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,060
The little turtle, the turtle.

622
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,060
Yeah.

623
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,060
So, uh, that's cool.

624
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,420
Cause I got that in my pokey decks and then, uh, JD was in Florida recently and it's supposed

625
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,500
to be bringing me a hair across and a course solo.

626
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,500
So I'm really excited.

627
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,500
Yay.

628
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,500
So that'll really help with my decks.

629
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,500
Now.

630
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,500
I just need mr.

631
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,500
Mime and King King is gone.

632
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,500
Um, so I guess I'll have to go to Australia.

633
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,500
I don't know.

634
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
Anyway.

635
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,540
Um, well they'll probably like do some event where they'll swap it over here.

636
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,060
And they had Kangaskhan in Anaheim at one point when they did Pokemon worlds.

637
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,060
Remember that?

638
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:52,140
And some of the crazies here drove all the way to Anaheim to get a fucking Kangaskhan,

639
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,260
which is like what an eight hour drive down there.

640
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,020
But you know, what does it is then go to Disneyland.

641
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,020
Yeah, I know.

642
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,020
Right.

643
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,020
Yeah.

644
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,060
It's like, you can't, you can't exactly say you're crazy going all the way to Anaheim

645
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,060
just to get a Kangaskhan.

646
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,340
If you're going to like swing by Disneyland, why there we'll just think about the mad mad

647
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,100
pokey stops that are going to be in Nintendo land whenever that opens.

648
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,100
Oh, right.

649
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,100
I'm sure.

650
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,820
Well, they're going to have to get submitted and go through that whole process, but I'm

651
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,220
sure it'll, I'm sure it'll fill out really.

652
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,220
I don't know.

653
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:19,900
Will Nintendo be able to submit players will do it in a heartbeat.

654
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,900
Yeah, absolutely.

655
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,900
Anyway.

656
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,260
Um, so non mobile AR gave me stuff I play cause there's been other stuff.

657
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,380
So, um, this just released this past week and it was kind of like one of those, I didn't

658
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:33,220
realize this was coming and uh, I had to get it when I saw that tempest 4,000 came out

659
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,220
this week.

660
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:38,180
Uh, it's a kind of the spiritual successor in many ways to tempest 2000.

661
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,860
No, it's this, it's the direct successor to tempest 3000.

662
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,900
Right.

663
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:47,540
Well, but wasn't 3000 kind of like 3000 was really just, you can't call it a spiritual

664
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,460
successor when it's actually in the same series.

665
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,980
Spiritual successor would mean it's a different series, but a similar game.

666
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,980
All right.

667
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,980
I guess even though, but it's, it's not on the same platform, but whatever I get what

668
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,980
you're saying.

669
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,780
So, um, so it's tempest 4,000.

670
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,480
Well here's, here's the thing, Jamie, here's why I think I'm leaning towards saying spiritual

671
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
successor.

672
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,360
Um, tempest 4,000 may be the first game that I refund on steam.

673
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:18,000
So it, it, it kinda like honestly in, in the position it's in right now, it doesn't deserve

674
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,240
to be in the same line as tempest 2000.

675
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,880
That's where my brain went.

676
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,920
But this is, this is supposed to be one of those games that's going to sell me on the

677
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,520
Atari ST or the new platform that they have, right?

678
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,720
Here's the thing.

679
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,840
It's not that my experiences with the game, I mean the game itself is okay.

680
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,640
I mean it doesn't really seem to do anything that much different than tempest 2000.

681
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,000
Here's the problem.

682
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,960
On PC, I don't know, and some of you have probably heard about this already.

683
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,640
The PC version is $10 cheaper than the console versions, which is cool.

684
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,320
I mean I'm not going to complain about that.

685
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,560
I mean I guess I would if I was more of a console person.

686
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,960
But the problem with the PC version is that they didn't do like anything.

687
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,440
It's like somebody just hit the switch to dump their comp, you know, dump the program

688
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,800
instead of compiling it for Xbox one, compiling for the PC.

689
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,560
And what I mean by that is you can't change any of the video options.

690
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,840
You can't change any of the keyboard mappings.

691
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,040
So either you're going to play with really fucking crazy keyboard mappings or you're

692
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,040
stuck.

693
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,780
You have to use an Xbox 360 controller.

694
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:29,940
You can't use the mouse, which is redonkulous for a game like tempest, which is not the

695
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,000
same thing on a controller.

696
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,220
And it just kind of like, it controls funky with the Xbox 360 controller.

697
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,960
I just don't like it.

698
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,920
So like, I just, I don't know, like honestly I played around in tempest 4000 like finally

699
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,360
when I figured out how to like to reboot my whole computer to get it to see the control

700
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,360
and all this stuff.

701
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,080
And I was just like, mama, this is garbage.

702
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:54,480
Like it's just, it's not what tempest 2000 was to me when it was on the Jaguar.

703
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,000
So I'm sorry to be so unkind, but at the same time, this is a half ass fucking port.

704
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,840
If I have ever seen one and this franchise deserves better.

705
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,280
Hello and welcome to modern day Atari where all of their ports are half ass pieces of

706
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,280
shit.

707
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:15,120
Enjoy processing my refund because it sucks because they redid, they redid alone in the

708
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,440
dark and it was shit.

709
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,960
They redid well tempest and I apparently that shit.

710
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,440
And then they, um, I think they ported their, well they're porting their mobile version

711
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:32,440
of um, theme park and that's going to be shit as well.

712
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:42,040
So I'm sorry, but my, my review on tempest 4000 is a pass until they fix the PC version.

713
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,040
What the fuck were they thinking putting that out?

714
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,040
That was awful.

715
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,680
That was a horrible decision.

716
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:53,960
So anyway, that's why I was trying to distance it from tempest 2000, which is an amazing

717
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,600
a game that, you know, from years and years ago, but unfortunately just like, you know,

718
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,520
you can't, anyway, I could go on and on.

719
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:07,480
Let's talk about something more positive, shall we, uh, a game that I, uh, did not think

720
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,640
I would enjoy, although it seems like everybody else I know was really enjoying it.

721
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,480
And finally it was one of those things where between all the Twitch streams, all the tweets

722
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,760
that kind of like positive buzz and energy was, I had to feed off of it.

723
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,640
And I finally, I plunked down the money and bought Octopath traveler, um, on the switch.

724
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,920
And I gotta say, I like it.

725
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,520
I really, really like it.

726
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,960
And it seems that the game is doing very well.

727
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,560
Um, I don't know if we have any hard sales numbers yet, but it really, I mean, and this

728
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,520
could be just like confirmation bias or whatever, but like I look at my friends list on the

729
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,080
switch and it's like, everybody is fucking playing this game.

730
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,440
Like, yeah, I haven't bought it yet.

731
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,960
This game has to be selling better than Square Enix could have projected, which I think is

732
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:56,420
a great thing because it shows that it's not that everything has to be Sprite retro type

733
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:01,720
of stuff, which I do like the kind of like hybridness of the fact that you are these

734
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,760
like old school sprites, but like, you know, it's a lot of like new school looking environments

735
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,320
where the water effects are beautiful and a lot of like the, you know, blurring that

736
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,720
they do and some of that stuff.

737
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,240
It looks really good when it's in motion.

738
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,880
I don't think screenshots do it justice.

739
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,600
It looks really good in motion.

740
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:20,820
Um, but anyway, my point is, is that, and the fact that the battle system is a very

741
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:25,160
kind of old school, you know, super Nintendo ask RPG battle system.

742
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,840
I mean, they do have some new stuff in it.

743
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,960
Like, you know, you have the breaking system, which is unique.

744
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,080
I don't remember seeing something like that in another game, but like, you know, at some

745
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:40,000
point, like one of the JRPG classics, final fantasy kind of really fell off the path with

746
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
the battle system.

747
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Right.

748
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,760
Because, you know, 10 was very kind of standard, but then 12 really changed it.

749
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:52,160
Um, which was, I still, I like 12, I'm not knocking 12, I love 12, but it was very different.

750
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:59,160
13 was really different and I still, I like 13s battle system, but it's not like a classic

751
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,160
JRPG at all.

752
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:06,400
And obviously I'm skipping 11 and 14 for obvious reasons, but then 15 was also another like

753
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,760
radical change to the battle system.

754
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:14,320
I don't feel as good on what they did with 15 as they did with 12 and 13, but okay.

755
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,080
So like, I don't know, like there's, there's part of me that says it's kind of good that

756
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:24,360
like an old school mechanic JRPG is being received this well, because I think it shows

757
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,100
that there's still a demand for that.

758
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,400
And I think it is going to send Square Enix a message.

759
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,720
Um, at least for the people in this country, you know, I don't know how the game is doing

760
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,440
in Japan, which is obviously very important as well, uh, to the direction that's going

761
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,440
to be taken.

762
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:42,680
But I think it is a sure, sure thing we will see an Octopath Traveler 2 or some type of,

763
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,800
you know, I don't know, where do you go from Octopath Traveler?

764
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,800
Like nine, what is the prefix for nine?

765
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
New chrono trigger?

766
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,800
Yeah.

767
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,800
I don't know.

768
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,800
Um, crap.

769
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,800
I actually know this.

770
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,480
Maybe they'll go, maybe they'll regress and do seven, heptapath, well hepta or septa.

771
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
Yeah.

772
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,480
Septopath.

773
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,480
Yeah.

774
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,480
What is nine?

775
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,480
I don't know.

776
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,480
Anyway.

777
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:13,520
Um, a tiger claw in chat says, uh, J D says nono, like a nonogram.

778
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,040
If you're using the same, um, Greek prefix.

779
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,040
Interesting.

780
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,040
Okay.

781
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,960
So it'd be, you would go to hepta, octo, enia, deca, if you're all using Greek.

782
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,520
So that would be seven, six.

783
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,960
Maybe they'll just get, cause I bet people wouldn't recognize the nines, they just go

784
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:33,880
to decapath traveler or they'll just do Octopath Traveler 2 and the local octopuses and Octomom

785
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,880
is in it.

786
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,880
Ultros is in it.

787
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,000
Ultros and, and Octodad is in it.

788
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Yes.

789
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,320
And um, what other famous octopi are there?

790
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,480
Um, that one that still that threw the fish at the guy because it didn't like his dinner.

791
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,480
Octodad.

792
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,480
I said Octodad.

793
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,480
Yeah.

794
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,480
Yeah.

795
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,480
Octodad.

796
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,480
Anyway.

797
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Here's my one criticism.

798
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,200
My one minor criticism of Octopi, cause obviously I, in all fairness, uh, I've sunk maybe like

799
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,880
five hours in the game and I have three characters, you know, like, and you have to go around

800
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,880
and collect all eight.

801
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,800
It's like, I've got a long way to go.

802
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:14,400
Um, I do feel like the three stories I've played so far, I started with Ophelia, who's

803
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,560
like your cleric, your healer.

804
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,300
Um, and then I picked up, I just kind of went in a circle cause I went to the nearest people.

805
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:25,180
So I've got Cyrus who's like the scholar, your black mage basically.

806
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:32,260
Uh, and then I just picked up Tressa who is a merchant, but she uses like spears and bows.

807
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,660
So she's kind of, I don't know, dragoon-y, I don't know what to call her.

808
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,060
Well, maybe more like a ocean merchant.

809
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,060
Yeah, actually.

810
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,060
Like a pirate.

811
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:44,580
She, again, she uses wind magic, so you're not too off base.

812
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,580
That probably, you're probably.

813
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,580
I think she's a pirate.

814
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,580
She's probably more a pirate.

815
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,900
In my heart, I think she's a pirate.

816
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,900
Yeah.

817
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,900
So anyway.

818
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,900
She uses highway robbery.

819
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:57,340
But anyway, the thing about all those stories, I liked them.

820
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:01,540
I thought Ophelia's was a little cliche-y RPG.

821
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,880
I was kind of like rolling my eyes, but I really liked the other two.

822
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,140
I really, really liked Tressa's.

823
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:14,340
Um, but anyway, uh, I did feel like all of their openings were the same template.

824
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:18,900
What I mean by that is that, you know, you get opening sequence.

825
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,140
You get, here is the path action that you're going to learn.

826
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,340
Now use it.

827
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:27,620
And then here is, you're going to go down one screen into another screen.

828
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,420
And then you're going to go down one more screen into the town.

829
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,020
And then right next to the town is the dungeon.

830
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,220
And at the end of the dungeon, you will fight the boss.

831
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,060
And then once you fight the boss, good job.

832
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,460
You can move on to the next one.

833
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:43,020
So I kind of felt like there's a very like template to it all.

834
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,580
But I also like, again, it's a minor, it's a minor criticism.

835
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:50,180
I just felt it was a little bit like, okay, I'd like to be maybe like surprised.

836
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:54,220
I can imagine that if you're doing a game where the whole kitsch is, you get to start

837
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:59,200
with any of the eight and do them in any order, then there has to be some sort of balance

838
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,200
between them all.

839
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,740
So I'm giving the game a pass.

840
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:08,140
I imagine the more fun and the less like copy pasty type of things will be when you have

841
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:12,000
your entire party and you start to move into the chapter two stuff so the game can start

842
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,500
to do different things because they'll know you have all eight characters.

843
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,660
It sounds very much like Seiken Densetsu though.

844
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,140
Seiken Densetsu 3.

845
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,140
Yes.

846
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,300
Where you start off with the different characters and the different paths.

847
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,060
Or Saga, which a lot of people are compared to.

848
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,780
But I didn't, I didn't like Saga.

849
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,940
I didn't like the battle system.

850
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,940
I didn't like...

851
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,940
I'm not a big Saga fan.

852
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,940
Yeah.

853
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:34,340
And honestly, it's what, when people compared Octopath to Saga, I was instantly like, had

854
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,340
that, I don't know.

855
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,340
You know what my thought is that I would like Octopath for the same reason I like Duprism

856
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,900
or what do we have, Threads of Fate over here.

857
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,860
Well, because you start, you have two paths.

858
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:48,620
You start off with each character and then eventually they, their stories merge.

859
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,620
So.

860
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,620
Um, let's see.

861
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:55,460
Uh, Ragenator in chat asks, Cyrus, like Billy Ray or Miley?

862
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,460
Clearly Miley.

863
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,460
Clearly.

864
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,060
I mean, Dolly Parton is her godmother.

865
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,060
Hello.

866
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,060
I know.

867
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,060
She came in like a wrecking ball.

868
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,340
Although Cyrus in this story is male.

869
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,340
But whatever.

870
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,340
All right.

871
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,340
Anyway.

872
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,500
Uh, Dartetsuya says, I was just thinking it sounds like Seiken Densetsu 3.

873
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,500
Yeah.

874
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,260
The layout kind of, kind of.

875
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,260
Anyway.

876
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,780
Um, so yeah, that's, that game's been taking up a lot of my time as well.

877
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,820
So otherwise I'm still playing Heroes of the Storm, Final Fantasy 14.

878
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:26,100
Um, if for those that play Final Fantasy 14, my, my Eureka, I just got my plus one weapon

879
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:30,900
in Eureka and I'm up to level 18 in the Eureka thing for all you three people that also are

880
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,300
playing Final Fantasy 14 out there.

881
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,060
But I'm having fun with that.

882
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,120
So there you go.

883
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,900
That's my kind of busy gaming week.

884
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,400
Sadly, I have to admit, I still have not been able to go through the motions of setting

885
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,560
up the VR and all that stuff.

886
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,680
I wanted to do it last week, but then I got sick.

887
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,780
Well, here's where I'm running into a problem.

888
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:49,280
This space in there where I have the PS4, it's kind of hard to like set up the camera.

889
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,980
I kind of don't have enough space, so I kind of have to do it out here, which means I got

890
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,920
to move everything out here and then I can't really stream it unless I do the native streaming

891
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,520
through the PS4.

892
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:05,240
But I mean, obviously as soon as we have a date for Tetris Effect, this will all be fast

893
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,240
tracked.

894
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,240
I think it's October.

895
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,240
Yeah.

896
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,240
It's, it's, it'll be here before we know it.

897
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,240
Almost August.

898
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,240
Right.

899
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:15,620
And then August means, Oh my God, Dragon cons in four weeks, which means by I'll be gone

900
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,620
for a week.

901
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,260
And then after that, I'll be like, Oh my God, it's September.

902
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,300
And it's like, you know, time moves so fast.

903
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,300
My God.

904
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,300
Anyway, it's like, Hey, here's fourth quarter games.

905
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,300
Yeah.

906
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,300
Right.

907
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,780
And then a new Smash Brothers and Nintendo online and everything's here.

908
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,460
So isn't that, that's until December, isn't it?

909
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,660
Uh, yeah, they gave the date for that.

910
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,660
It's it's December.

911
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,660
Yes.

912
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,480
I mean, it's past the November rush, but I remember is a Pokemon.

913
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,480
Yeah.

914
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:47,680
Well, I also, I kind of feel like thanks to the age of digital distribution in part, uh,

915
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,720
the day at having your game out by black Friday, isn't what it used to be.

916
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,720
No.

917
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,720
You know what I mean?

918
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,220
I've been buying digitally anyways for everything.

919
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:00,680
So the holiday time period, isn't what it used to be, you know, and the same thing has

920
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,300
been happening to movies.

921
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:07,960
You know, the two big times to release movies are the summer and the holidays.

922
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,960
Right.

923
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,960
Which is still mostly true.

924
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,440
Like a lot of movies make a lot of big money in those timeframes, but like, I think in

925
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,380
the past, you know, five or so years, you've really seen where like, you know what movies

926
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:22,560
can come out in February, March, you know, they can come out in October and still make

927
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,560
a ton of money.

928
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,560
You know what I mean?

929
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,560
Mm hmm.

930
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,680
Um, like Deadpool was like a February movie, right?

931
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,680
No, it was March.

932
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,680
Well, the original Deadpool.

933
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,680
Yeah.

934
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,680
Original Deadpool was on Valentine's day.

935
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,680
Right.

936
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,680
And then the new one was in March.

937
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,420
So they were, and they both made shit, tons of money.

938
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,420
So, you know, because they were great.

939
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,420
Yeah, exactly.

940
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:42,620
It's like, you know, people will go to the cinema to see a movie, you know, last movie

941
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,980
I saw was Deadpool two.

942
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:44,980
Yeah.

943
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:49,820
Which God, the last movie I saw was probably whatever art movie you and I saw earlier this

944
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:50,820
year.

945
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:56,140
Either like, no, we didn't see, I thought you were going to go see a, the second mama

946
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,140
mia movie.

947
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,980
I had, nobody would see it with me on Friday night.

948
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,640
I haven't seen the first one, but I'll go see it with you as long as I'm at home by

949
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,640
10.

950
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,640
Oh, I've seen it next Saturday.

951
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,640
We'll figure it out.

952
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,960
Well then the other thing is, and I was going to say is that my friend in the Bay area,

953
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,200
Melody who had the baby recently, I still haven't been able to visit the baby cause

954
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,560
Melody's had all her, yeah, well, Melody's had, she, she, I don't want to get in all

955
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,520
her business on the, she's been sick so, but she's fine now.

956
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,040
So I'm going to go visit her and see the baby.

957
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,200
And then she said, fuck yeah, we're going to go see the mama mia thing.

958
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,940
So I knew I'd get to go see it in like two weeks, but I've got to get past this clue

959
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,900
thing first, which admittedly is my own fault for being involved with that.

960
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,900
So anyway.

961
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:36,900
Okay.

962
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,900
But it's fun.

963
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,900
It's fun.

964
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:39,900
It's so fun.

965
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:40,900
The picture came out.

966
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,300
I don't know if you saw the picture of me as Mrs. Peacock, but it's out there now.

967
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,780
So I'm very proud.

968
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:45,780
Thank you.

969
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:46,780
Thank you.

970
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,140
I am having a lot of fun with it.

971
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,140
It's good.

972
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:52,100
So anyway, that's some good drag.

973
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:57,420
So I, I man, I feel like a woman, but I'll tell you this, you know, you have to do the

974
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,920
Ms. Cracker thing.

975
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,720
She's a woman.

976
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,720
I did.

977
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,080
When I saw, when I saw myself in the mirror the first time after all the makeup was done,

978
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:10,000
I did do the whole mother, I am gorgeous from drag race.

979
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,240
So it was fun.

980
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:19,080
But I will say being a woman is hard fucking work because the core set fucking hurts.

981
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:24,240
Like all my insides are basically being shoved into every other part of my body.

982
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,240
Right.

983
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,240
Okay.

984
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,420
But I was never one to like disrespect femininity women go through.

985
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:35,500
I'm letting y'all know, yo, I'm still giving you a shit eating grin.

986
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,660
Listen here, man.

987
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:40,860
Real men try on a core set sometime and try what those ladies go.

988
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,860
And I would, I don't just mean like put on the core set.

989
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:50,300
I mean, let her lace it and Oh my God, you will have a new found respect for what women

990
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,300
go through.

991
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,040
Because I got to get them hip somehow.

992
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:58,760
And the course that does that, I'm not going to pad because the dress doesn't like Mrs.

993
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:03,800
Peacock's dress is too fifties conservative to really show the padding and which means

994
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,880
I don't have to tuck the boys away either.

995
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,560
So I don't have to go like, I hope you have a good crinoline though.

996
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,560
I we're good.

997
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,560
We're good.

998
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,560
Okay.

999
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,560
Um, but then what was I gonna say?

1000
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,560
Um, dang it.

1001
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,400
Oh, the shoes.

1002
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,860
Jesus Christ.

1003
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,360
And I've done heels before.

1004
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,360
Thanks to Rocky horror.

1005
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,360
Okay.

1006
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:23,020
These are like little heels, but these are like straight up.

1007
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:26,580
Fuck me pumps that I'm wearing and they, they hurt my fucking leg.

1008
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:29,620
Like I will be impressed if I get through that show.

1009
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,420
Tape your first two toes together.

1010
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:34,980
Oh, like I'm on my feet on your feet.

1011
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:35,980
It will help.

1012
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:36,980
Okay.

1013
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:37,980
Good to know.

1014
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,980
Why?

1015
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:39,980
Why not?

1016
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:40,980
Everything else.

1017
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:41,980
My body is all laced up.

1018
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:42,980
Plus, plus, plus, plus, plus.

1019
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:48,580
You can get the, uh, ball of your heel pads that don't get the Dr. Scholl's one.

1020
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:51,520
Get the CVS one because they're cheaper and they do just a good job.

1021
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,520
Good to know.

1022
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,520
Trust me.

1023
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,240
JD in chat says, did you choose a drag name?

1024
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:01,520
Um, at the end of the day, I decided to do the Chad Michaels thing and just do Rob Roberts

1025
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,840
so that I don't, well, I didn't want to split my branding.

1026
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,840
Does that make sense?

1027
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,840
I didn't want it.

1028
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:10,240
And it's, it's part the Willem thing too.

1029
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,320
Is it except you're not an asshole?

1030
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,320
Well I try.

1031
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:20,220
But is that if this is really, really well received and it's like, Hey Rob, we want to

1032
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,820
give you a paid gig, but you should do it in a dress cause it would be funny.

1033
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,060
Then it's like, I have no, I'll do the Eddie Izzard thing.

1034
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,780
I have no, no problem with it.

1035
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,780
Whatever.

1036
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,780
It is what it is.

1037
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,780
Gender is a construct.

1038
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:31,780
Tear it apart.

1039
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:37,620
Uh, actually I know, um, a local queen comedian I could put you in contact with.

1040
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:38,620
So okay.

1041
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,620
If you were interested.

1042
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,620
You never know.

1043
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:41,620
You never know.

1044
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,600
Rob Roberts says, I have laced many a cosplayer in a corset.

1045
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:50,780
I legit understand, but Rama, until you've been in that corset, which you don't have

1046
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:54,560
to say in chat if you have or not, I'm just saying, until you've been in that corset,

1047
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,480
you don't really know.

1048
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,480
Just say it.

1049
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,480
That's it.

1050
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,840
I want to see Ron Chan do bust out some Akane cosplay.

1051
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,840
All right.

1052
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,760
Saying like sexy cross play Luigi.

1053
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:11,440
If I would do that, if that's what makes them happy, then sure.

1054
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,720
All right.

1055
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,260
But in the meantime, there's so many people out there probably listening going, I thought

1056
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,500
this was a video game podcast.

1057
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:25,820
It is, but sometimes you play video games and corset and heels and that's fine.

1058
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,820
You know what?

1059
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,820
I've decided.

1060
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:28,820
What?

1061
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:29,820
I'm going to do girl Mario.

1062
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:30,820
Maria.

1063
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,820
Maria?

1064
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:32,820
For what?

1065
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:33,820
Maria.

1066
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,820
Like a-

1067
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:35,820
For maybe Saconomy.

1068
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:38,500
Mag West is coming up, but man, it's on a, it's on a busy fucking weekend.

1069
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,500
Mag West.

1070
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:45,320
I got shit going on, but I've been wanting to do Sacanime and I'm going to try to remake

1071
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:50,360
my Grey Warden, but actually I'm redoing my Jill Valentine.

1072
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:55,220
You remember my very, very first cosplay that I did out here was my Jill costume.

1073
00:48:55,220 --> 00:49:00,900
I am going to remake my Jill Valentine costume now that I am probably a good four sizes smaller

1074
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:05,200
than when I did it last time, which by the way, today marks a hundred pounds down.

1075
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,200
Really?

1076
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,360
All you have to do now is find two giant slices of bread.

1077
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,640
Do you want me to die?

1078
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,360
I ate pizza the other day.

1079
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,680
No, to be a Jill sandwich.

1080
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,680
Right.

1081
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,240
All right.

1082
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:25,400
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

1083
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,080
use the passphrase, fun.

1084
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,840
Let's get into some video game news.

1085
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,160
Believe it or not, we have some around here.

1086
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:37,080
Starting off with a game that's kind of a pleasant surprise to see back in the news,

1087
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,080
right?

1088
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,080
Exactly.

1089
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,920
Like it's about time that the game came out that I bought.

1090
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,120
Was it two years ago?

1091
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,120
One year ago?

1092
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:52,600
I can't remember when this came out originally, but No Man's Sky Next is getting its due time.

1093
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,040
I guess they're releasing it now.

1094
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,820
It's going to be coming to the Xbox.

1095
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:00,400
And what does No Man's Sky Next add to the game?

1096
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,300
Well, true multiplayer.

1097
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:07,660
So not this like, oh, hey, I'm in the same place as you are, or I see a glowing thing

1098
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:08,860
or something like that.

1099
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:13,380
No, you actually will see the actual people that you're playing with.

1100
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:20,180
So they're going to have third person options, true multiplayer, ringed planets.

1101
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,420
Also there's going to be a visual overhaul.

1102
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:27,980
You can build bases on any planet and you'll be able to assemble and upgrade a fleet of

1103
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,620
frigates and command them from the bridge of your freighter.

1104
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,020
So that's pretty awesome.

1105
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:41,580
So that'll be coming out, of course, on PlayStation 4 and PC on July 24th and will be releasing

1106
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,740
on Xbox One, which includes everything.

1107
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,060
So hurry.

1108
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,140
I can't wait to try it.

1109
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:51,580
And if you already own the game, which many of you do, this is going to be just a free

1110
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:53,500
free update, free update.

1111
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,820
Just like they've done several big updates.

1112
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:57,820
It's crazy.

1113
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:00,500
I haven't played it since they did any of those updates.

1114
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:05,560
So I'm very looking forward to going back to play super update and it's going to look

1115
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,860
awesome because 4K TV.

1116
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:08,860
Yeah.

1117
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,460
So I'm looking forward to that.

1118
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:11,460
Nice.

1119
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,460
Yeah.

1120
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,460
I'm, I'm excited to check this out again.

1121
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:18,180
You know, I, I did check it out not a terribly long time ago, probably after their last big

1122
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:22,680
update, but I'm, you know, I'm excited for a chance to go back and revisit this game.

1123
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,320
I do love that they, you know, have done this as a free, you know, update.

1124
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:31,440
I'm not sure where the money's coming from to have sustained that studio for two years.

1125
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,880
I guess the game is selling well enough, even in a lot of the markdown prices or when it

1126
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:41,040
first came out or what have you, um, that they had enough money to kind of pour back

1127
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,680
maybe additional sales on PC and now on Xbox One, I mean, that's a whole new audience.

1128
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,680
So I guess, but you know, most studios would have, you know, taken the money imported into

1129
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,680
a new project.

1130
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:56,100
So it's pretty cool that they've, you know, kind of committed themselves to making a more

1131
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,720
fully realized game.

1132
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,080
Well, here's the thing.

1133
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,160
I never hated the game to begin with.

1134
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:07,240
Like it wasn't a 10 out of 10 to me, but I didn't allow myself to buy into all that hype.

1135
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,240
And you know that.

1136
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,240
Right.

1137
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,240
Yeah.

1138
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,520
Cause it was all about like, Oh, let's get to the center of the universe and you get

1139
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,480
to the center of the universe and it's like, Oh, and there's nothing there.

1140
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,960
Well, but here's, here's the thing.

1141
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,540
You know, that there was all that lead up with all this and I was sitting here saying,

1142
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,540
so where's the game?

1143
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,540
Where's the fucking game?

1144
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:25,540
You know what?

1145
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,140
I don't care anymore until they show us the game.

1146
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:31,420
So you know, by the time the game finally came out, I feel like since I didn't really

1147
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:39,200
have expectations, I enjoyed it for what it was, which for me was more of like a Zen Minecraft

1148
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,960
type of experience.

1149
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:45,340
You know, and I think a lot of people made this narrative based on, you know, what the

1150
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:48,600
developers were saying at the time and putting out there in the media, which they've certainly

1151
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,860
learned their lessons since then was they were looking for probably more like an action

1152
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:55,200
space game, which I never was expecting ever.

1153
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,440
I liked the Zen Minecraft part of it, but there just wasn't a lot to do on any of the

1154
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,440
planets originally.

1155
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:05,800
And, and if you wanted to just sit there and mine a plan and build stuff or whatever, well,

1156
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:10,420
then you have to fend off all the robot centuries that don't like you mining the planet, even

1157
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:14,740
if you go to a peaceful planet or it's like, Oh, Hey, look at all this inventory shuffling

1158
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:15,740
I have to do.

1159
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:21,220
And that was fixed several updates ago, but you know, I'm talking about when I first played

1160
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:26,460
it and my last memory of it, which was like, Oh, well I can't stack any of this stuff and

1161
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:32,060
Oh, my ship's out of fuel now and better go mine some fuel and I don't go to this other

1162
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,060
planet.

1163
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:35,180
Oh, look, it's the same shit.

1164
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:39,140
So I'm excited to try it again and I'm curious to see how the multiplayer component works

1165
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:40,140
out.

1166
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:45,040
Like, I'm not really going to go seeking out other people, but I'm curious, like if somebody's

1167
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,480
on the same planet as you, is it going to come up on like your radar?

1168
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:54,360
Like there's another player like on this planet, but you know, again, it's an entire fucking

1169
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,360
planet.

1170
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:59,360
So like, just because somebody is on that planet, they could be, you know, so far away

1171
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,360
from you.

1172
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,360
Yeah.

1173
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,360
If there's like billions of planets.

1174
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,360
Yeah.

1175
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,360
I know it's going to be interesting to see how that all works.

1176
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,720
So, uh, I'll be, I'll be revisiting the game again.

1177
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,720
I know I will.

1178
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,720
So, uh, very cool.

1179
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,720
What about you?

1180
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,720
You know, you can pick up the wind sky again.

1181
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,720
Play that.

1182
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,720
Oh, yeah.

1183
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,720
I'll try it.

1184
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:14,720
If I ever get the TV again.

1185
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,120
I was hoping that they do like a VR mode for it.

1186
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,320
You know, maybe that would be cool.

1187
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,320
Maybe.

1188
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,880
Uh, as she went under Matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I really wanted

1189
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,960
the game to be like the spaceship parts of the book version of ready player one.

1190
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:32,960
Uh, cause you don't chat says devs don't like to abandon their games these days.

1191
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:33,960
That's part of the problem.

1192
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,760
I miss the good old days when a dev would just run off and leave the game open for mods

1193
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,760
to have fun with.

1194
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,760
Oh, don't worry.

1195
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,920
There's plenty of companies out there.

1196
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,000
They'll abandon their games.

1197
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
No problem.

1198
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,320
So that's, there's not an issue.

1199
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,920
There's plenty of games.

1200
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:51,560
Uh, EA would like to, uh, woo you to download origin cause you don't, um, but, uh, I mean,

1201
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:56,840
I kinda like, I kinda get what you're saying, but at the same time, this isn't the first

1202
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,280
time that we've seen developers stick with a game they really believe in either.

1203
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:05,040
Like I think Diablo three is probably the biggest example of a game that they did turn

1204
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,240
around a couple of years after release.

1205
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:11,120
You know, Diablo three now is not anything like it was when it first released.

1206
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,800
And uh, it's, it's a lot of fun to play now.

1207
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:16,720
I still play Diablo three here and there, but when that game first released, it was,

1208
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,720
it was sloppy.

1209
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,560
Uh, which for a big series like Diablo was a really ugly thing.

1210
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:25,160
So do you think Diablo four this year at Blizzcon or?

1211
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:32,280
I want to believe just like another expansion, like, like, like an X files poster, but with,

1212
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:38,640
you know, a demon hunter instead of a UFO, I want to believe, um, but I, no, I don't

1213
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,320
think it'll be another expansion.

1214
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:44,280
It would be weird at this point to have another expansion when the necromancer wasn't really

1215
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,280
an expansion.

1216
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,160
I know they call it the necromancer expansion, but it wasn't, it wasn't a real expansion.

1217
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,160
You know what I mean?

1218
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,000
I think Diablo three, it's time to close the book on it and go to Diablo four, whether

1219
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,680
it's this year, the announced, maybe I want to believe, okay, but the game won't be out

1220
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,680
this year.

1221
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,680
So it won't matter.

1222
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,680
They can announce it this year.

1223
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,280
It won't actually come out till 2020 probably it'll be on the next stage of consoles.

1224
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,280
We'll see.

1225
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,600
And then of course Final Fantasy 14 was another game they really turned around, but like,

1226
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:15,200
I feel like the Final Fantasy 14 that's out now, like wasn't even the same game that was

1227
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,200
originally released.

1228
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,800
Still waiting for 11 on mobile.

1229
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:22,480
But the interesting thing about 14's original release, like No Man's Sky, they continued

1230
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,600
to patch the shit out of that original Final Fantasy 14 until they finally were ready to

1231
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:32,480
pull the plug on it and begin the makeover for Realm Reborn, which caused the game to

1232
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,640
be down for like, I don't know, it was like eight weeks or something when they, before

1233
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:40,440
they launched Realm Reborn, which, you know, was, is now I think the best MMO out there

1234
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:45,060
right now is, is 14 or hell let's just, let's upgrade 11 with better graphics.

1235
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,880
Just keep it all the same since it's going to be on mobile platforms anyways and bring

1236
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,880
it to switch.

1237
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:55,280
Uh, one more comment here on No Man's Sky Dungeon Buster says, once you get settled

1238
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:00,720
into a routine of mining, resupplying, flying repeat, it got really boring, but the huge

1239
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,840
content patches have added a lot more since then.

1240
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:09,360
Some other comments on patching, Dungeon Buster says they're still adding free content to

1241
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,960
Monster Hunter World too.

1242
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,960
Same with The Division.

1243
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,960
Yeah, that's always.

1244
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,160
Well, I mean, we have a story later on, I think about Mario Kart 8, you know, a lot

1245
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,880
of games are getting like patching updates, which is pretty cool.

1246
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:25,200
S21 Hunter Matt suggesting how to change your 4K TV monopolization problems.

1247
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,880
Loki needs a gamer cave with his own TV.

1248
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,440
Okay, let me just add on to the house because you get the garage.

1249
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,440
Well, here's what's going to happen.

1250
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:38,440
Well, I already do have the hot ass fucking garage to work out in and play DDR in.

1251
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:42,440
It's 110 degrees in there when I'm playing DDR.

1252
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,440
Let's just put it this way.

1253
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,640
I'm soaking wet.

1254
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:50,640
Like I have to literally, I can't wear a shirt on and it's just soaking wet, which is gross,

1255
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,640
but it works.

1256
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,080
Here's what's going to actually happens.

1257
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:56,640
Our old TV is going in our bedroom and our old TV still has all the streaming stuff on

1258
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:02,080
it so we can, she can watch it on there because she even discovered the other day because

1259
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:09,440
she's been using Prime Video and Prime Video kind of sucks, but, you know, Prime Video

1260
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:14,120
have to either go through our new TV or my PlayStation 4 and because it wasn't on the

1261
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:18,760
other app, but she found that the house is on the NBC app, which is weird because I thought

1262
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,760
it was on Fox.

1263
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,920
I'm not sure why it's on NBC, but it's on NBC now.

1264
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,600
So she's like, oh, they're all the episodes are right here too.

1265
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,520
I guess I don't need to go through the Prime app anymore.

1266
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,520
I'm like, uh-huh.

1267
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,520
Get off the TV.

1268
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,520
So I will eventually get a TV back.

1269
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:38,840
All I have to do is ask too, but I, I've been mainly trying to focus on actually doing programming

1270
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:44,640
and stuff and building something because I know everybody wants me to and I, you know,

1271
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,840
I'll get around to it.

1272
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:50,440
If I really want to play No Man's Sky, like if that was like, I was dying to do it, I'd

1273
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:54,040
just download it on a PC and play it on my PC.

1274
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,040
All right.

1275
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:59,600
Well, speaking of, uh, Mario Kart, uh, I know this was, uh, something that was going around

1276
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,600
this week.

1277
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:05,440
I think this is because of, uh, Comic-Con, but there are some Mario Kart Hot Wheels that

1278
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,680
are going to be coming.

1279
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:12,720
So didn't we get like, uh, we had like Atari influenced Hot Wheels was the thing.

1280
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,840
Well, they have Mario flavored Hot Wheels right now.

1281
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:21,240
In fact, I actually saw some at GameStop when we were just stopping by there today, but

1282
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:25,320
they're like, these are, they're like, you know, Mario paint jobs on like regular car.

1283
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:29,960
Oh no, these are full on, like the carts with the characters in them.

1284
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:33,560
These are like full on, uh, actual like car racers.

1285
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,920
Anyway, uh, Mattel partner with Nintendo to do this.

1286
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:36,920
They are licensed toys.

1287
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,560
They're going to be out in 2019.

1288
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:42,560
Uh, they were viewable at San Diego Comic-Con, which was probably like the big thing that

1289
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,560
was going on this weekend.

1290
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,680
Uh, unfortunately I don't think everybody's getting a release cause there's a lot of characters

1291
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,240
in Mario Kart, but you will be able to get Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Wario, Rosalina,

1292
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,820
Toad, and Yoshi.

1293
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:57,920
Hot Wheels are also going to be making tracks inspired by various Mario Kart courses.

1294
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:04,160
The cars will be $5, uh, each coming out June of 2019.

1295
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:09,440
So expensive, cheaper than an amiibo.

1296
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,440
I don't know.

1297
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,440
I, I'm still tempted.

1298
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,440
I think they look really cool.

1299
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,920
You think, I think your kids would be into these.

1300
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:14,920
Wouldn't they?

1301
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:15,920
Oh yeah.

1302
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,280
They always like beg me for Hot Wheels.

1303
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,400
We have a whole bucket of Hot Wheels that they don't play with.

1304
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,400
They're not Mario.

1305
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:26,440
Well, we have like Hot Wheels, like, okay, so like when I was playing, I used to play

1306
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,440
with Hot Wheels all the time.

1307
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,160
I used to have miles of that like orange track that actually is my dad's track.

1308
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,900
Uh, when he had, when he was a kid, just to tell you how old that stuff is.

1309
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:40,680
So like we would play with that and actually build our own courses.

1310
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,400
But now when you buy the track, first off, it's fucking expensive.

1311
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,700
And second, all of the like track that you can buy is in a set.

1312
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:51,520
Always does something weird and funky and it's just like, you can't loop it with the

1313
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,520
rest of it.

1314
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,680
It's like we have one right now that like it goes in like a figure eight really fast

1315
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,480
and then they crashed into each other and it's really boring, but it's also fucking

1316
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,940
loud and takes up a ton of fucking space.

1317
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:04,320
So that's why we don't play with it.

1318
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:08,340
Uh, cause you do in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, will there be shortages?

1319
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:09,920
And then we have to find them on eBay.

1320
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,160
Um, Hot Wheels, no, this is Mattel.

1321
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,600
They fucking know how to manufacture shit.

1322
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,240
This isn't Nintendo manufacturing this.

1323
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,240
There'll be no problems.

1324
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,440
Well, but are they going to be able to, I mean, what's the demand going to be like and

1325
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,560
will they be able to anticipate that demand?

1326
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,080
I mean, I don't really know.

1327
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:32,640
I don't normally seek out specific Hot Wheels, so I'm not really sure, but I would imagine

1328
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:37,880
that Mattel's got the manufacturing thing down and they'll, they'll play this fake shortage

1329
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:38,880
bullshit.

1330
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,880
All right.

1331
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:43,680
Some other comments on, uh, the, uh, desirability in our chat.

1332
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:48,000
So maybe Mattel better get ready with a lot of these cause Rama says, I legit want them.

1333
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,520
Uh, Dartetsuya says, I thought those were neat.

1334
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:54,340
Definitely spoke to my inner child and me and now lol used to collect die cast cars

1335
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:55,340
like you wouldn't believe.

1336
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:59,800
I do want the toad cart and our buddy captain spike from game buoy.org.

1337
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,800
Hello.

1338
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:06,120
Says simply want in all caps and that's a, we actually do collect Hot Wheels.

1339
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,120
Do you?

1340
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:11,760
We collect all the Mustangs and all the Fiat's on a scale of one to want.

1341
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,240
How do you feel about the, uh, Mario Kart Hot Wheels?

1342
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:20,040
I'm actually kind of indifferent just because, um, we're not like as big on it as we used

1343
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,040
to be.

1344
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,440
Um, it'd be nice to have, but I mean the last things that, you know, I'll pick up Deanna

1345
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,840
Mustang every so often, you know, cause he loves his Mustangs and I'll pick up a Fiat

1346
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,400
when I find it, but I don't know.

1347
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,120
It just seems like it'd be more stuff that would take up more space in my already overrun

1348
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,560
toy house.

1349
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:41,840
There's a part of me that wants to get at least one or two just to see if Mr. Smoosh

1350
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,920
will chase it around the house.

1351
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,920
Okay.

1352
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:45,920
Story time.

1353
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:46,920
Okay.

1354
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:55,040
Dan used to love chasing Shermy around the house with our RC, um, uh, initial D cars.

1355
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:59,280
You remember those ones that used to sell at all the anime conventions and then we had

1356
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:05,600
also a RC Coro Q cars and we would chase Shermy around with them until she realized stairs.

1357
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:10,680
And that's my story about Shermy, rest in peace.

1358
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:11,680
All right.

1359
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,680
Um, well Jamie, why you got the mic?

1360
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:15,000
Why don't we move on to the next story?

1361
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,720
Whale speaking of some Nintendo, you know, they were going to do a game.

1362
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:25,000
Well, it was canceled eight years ago, but it would have been the last Tingle thing to

1363
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,580
release and it was going to be a scary game.

1364
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:36,620
And it was supposed to be where Tingle goes into a wizard of Oz esque storybook and he

1365
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:41,780
has to dance with the realms princess to escape.

1366
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:45,700
First of all, Tingle is scary all on his own.

1367
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:51,820
They were working with a van pool and this is according to the producer, uh, Tana Bekinski,

1368
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:54,660
um, who gave this out.

1369
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,220
So, um, weird.

1370
01:03:57,220 --> 01:03:59,940
Um, I don't, I don't know.

1371
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:04,420
I mean, they did a Tingle game that came out with, um, what was it?

1372
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:09,320
Four swords, Avengers that came out in Japan with, with it, um, that we never saw the light

1373
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:15,740
of day over here officially, um, four swords, Avengers.

1374
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:16,740
Yeah.

1375
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:17,740
They have four swords game.

1376
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:18,740
It was a free download.

1377
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:21,060
It was the Tetris game.

1378
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:22,260
I don't know.

1379
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:24,460
Maybe it was the Tetra game that didn't come with it.

1380
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:25,460
Nevermind.

1381
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:30,580
But, um, but anyway, uh, we have no Tingle, scary, weird game.

1382
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:32,300
Well, that's disappointing.

1383
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:34,300
Would you have played a Silent Hill starring Tingle?

1384
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,220
It doesn't seem like it'd be very Silent Hill.

1385
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:39,300
It just seemed like it would just be weird.

1386
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:42,300
Uh, going to chat at live.vognetwork.com.

1387
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,300
Silent Mushroom Kingdom.

1388
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,900
S2100 Matt says Tingle murder party.

1389
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,020
Wait, it would be Silent Hyrule.

1390
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:51,260
Uh, JD says any game starring Tingle is a horror game.

1391
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:56,060
Speaking of horror games, I found, I have some of the Burger King games still, oh, like

1392
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:57,060
sneak King.

1393
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,060
I don't have sneaking.

1394
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:01,980
I have the motor cycle racing game, which I don't know why I don't have sneak King.

1395
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,500
Cause I would have totally kept that.

1396
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:09,060
So I don't know where that is, but I have the, the motor, the mini bike racing one.

1397
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:12,060
Are those backwards compatible on Xbox one and the whole thing?

1398
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:14,660
Um, well the, their expert, I don't know if they're backwards compatible.

1399
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:19,060
I know they, their Xbox, the original Xbox and the mini bike racing one.

1400
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:24,260
Their Xbox, the original Xbox and Xbox 360 on one disc, which is kind of unique.

1401
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:25,260
Oh yeah.

1402
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:26,260
That's right.

1403
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,260
I forgot they were original Xbox.

1404
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:28,260
Yeah.

1405
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:29,260
Yeah.

1406
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,260
Yeah.

1407
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,260
Interesting.

1408
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:34,300
By the way, there's something else that I remembered about figures and toys that are,

1409
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:39,020
they announced at, uh, comic con golden girls action figures, Rob.

1410
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:40,020
Oh yeah.

1411
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:43,460
There, there's like golden girls, nostalgia is at an all time high.

1412
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:48,380
I've been getting links on my wall about like Pez dispensers and like, like every, you used

1413
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:50,140
to have quite the Pez dispenser collection.

1414
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:51,340
I did back in the day.

1415
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:52,340
They're all kind of in a drawer now.

1416
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:57,460
I don't really have them on display or anymore, but um, yeah, uh, I mean, here's the thing.

1417
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:58,460
I love the golden girls.

1418
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:02,620
It will always be one of my favorite shows ever, but like I'm finding with all these,

1419
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:06,180
um, all these things that they have, I'm starting to hit my limit.

1420
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:07,180
You know what I mean?

1421
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:09,300
Like I, I don't need every single fucking golden girl.

1422
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:10,500
You know what's next, right?

1423
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,500
What?

1424
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,500
Designing women.

1425
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:13,500
Yeah.

1426
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,740
I know justice for, hashtag justice for designing women.

1427
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,420
We're going to have the Delta Burke pop.

1428
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:24,020
It is an underappreciated like, you know, eighties slash nineties, uh, classic.

1429
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:25,020
Yeah.

1430
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:29,980
We need like a Delta Burke and uh, um, God, what was her name that the play Julia Sugar

1431
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:33,300
Baker, like the, the lead in that show, I don't remember her name.

1432
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:36,780
Not Delta Burke cause they wrote her out and it was the Charlene character.

1433
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:38,860
That show was good.

1434
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:41,140
It was, that's what I found with like my, my new TV.

1435
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:44,860
They have this thing called the Roku channel cause it has a built in Roku inside of it

1436
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:49,780
and the Roku channel, for those who are not aware, has a bunch of old shit that you would

1437
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:52,600
just never think that somebody would license.

1438
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:57,820
So it has like old TV and old movies, really weird, random shit that's on there.

1439
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:03,860
For example, it has, see, it has the complete series of Elf or it has,

1440
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:05,940
Elf had a really weird ending.

1441
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:13,260
Or it has, um, the complete series of Grace Under Fire or, uh, what was the other weird

1442
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:16,580
show that was on there that was, I was like, well, that's odd.

1443
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:19,060
Has short circuit too, but not the first short circuit.

1444
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:20,060
Sorry.

1445
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:21,060
Important interruption.

1446
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:22,060
Dixie Carter.

1447
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:23,260
Why couldn't I fucking remember that?

1448
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:24,260
Dixie Carter.

1449
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:25,260
Okay, sorry.

1450
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:26,260
Yeah.

1451
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:28,220
So like a bunch of weird stuff that I went through and go, I'm going to make my kids

1452
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:34,620
watch this and they're going to hate me for it, but I don't care because it's Elf.

1453
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:37,140
Elf is pretty cool except the part where he tries to eat cats.

1454
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:38,780
I don't like that.

1455
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:41,780
I don't like that, but he never did actually get to eat a cat.

1456
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:43,540
So I think that's, that's good.

1457
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:48,180
Apparently the people who were on that show hated being on it because of all the holes

1458
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:50,300
that they had to do the puppet through.

1459
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:51,300
Oh, Alf.

1460
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,300
Yeah.

1461
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:53,300
Oh God.

1462
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:54,300
I can only imagine.

1463
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,300
Yeah.

1464
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,300
But the ending was such a downer.

1465
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:57,700
Oh gosh.

1466
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:58,700
I watched it live.

1467
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,420
I'm like, I was scarred for life.

1468
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:04,980
Captain Spike is asking what service was this?

1469
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,580
It's just the, it's Roku.

1470
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:11,020
And so Roku has their own channel called the Roku channel and it has a bunch of free stuff.

1471
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:14,140
I think it's all like sponsored by Geico or something like that.

1472
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:15,620
It's just random shit.

1473
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:20,300
Like they have all sorts of random movies on there and random TV shows.

1474
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:21,300
I'll take random TV shows.

1475
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:22,300
Yeah.

1476
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:24,420
I was like, I was like, it's free.

1477
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:29,140
I'm not complaining about free short circuit to cool, which they had the first one, but

1478
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:30,260
I remember too.

1479
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:35,240
Uh, where, where could I find a old episodes of a small wonder?

1480
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:40,500
That's another internet where where's, where's our like Harriet dolls.

1481
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:44,820
They have like, was it Harriet was the neighbor Vicki Vicki was like, I think, I think they

1482
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:46,260
had like Adam's family on there.

1483
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:48,940
They had like a bunch of like Nick at night stuff on there too.

1484
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:50,900
Like I dream a genie was on there.

1485
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,700
Like it just random shit.

1486
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:54,380
I don't know.

1487
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,380
Anyway.

1488
01:08:55,380 --> 01:09:00,340
Uh, they're, they're talking about a downer endings in our chat room at live.com cause

1489
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:02,420
the Alf sitcom had a downer ending.

1490
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:07,540
Uh, and then, uh, act deaf to saying dinosaurs series ending though.

1491
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:08,540
That was a downer.

1492
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:10,620
I don't even remember the end of that one.

1493
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:12,740
Uh, spoiler alert.

1494
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:15,020
If I remember right, a comet hits the earth and kills them all.

1495
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:16,020
I guess that makes sense.

1496
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:17,020
Yeah.

1497
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,540
Cause that's kind of what happens.

1498
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:19,540
Yeah.

1499
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:20,540
If I remember, am I right on that?

1500
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:22,340
I just remember that was the thing.

1501
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:26,740
Like a comet hits the earth, kills them all.

1502
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:27,740
Which why are we laughing?

1503
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:28,740
It's not funny.

1504
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:36,540
Remember when all the dinosaurs died?

1505
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:38,540
All right.

1506
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:39,540
Anyway.

1507
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:45,340
Oh, active says an ice age happens and they're realizing that they will die a slow frozen

1508
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:46,340
death.

1509
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:47,340
I was close.

1510
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:48,340
Oh, that's even better.

1511
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:49,340
I was close.

1512
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:50,340
That's even funnier.

1513
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:51,340
All right.

1514
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:53,340
Anyway.

1515
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:54,340
Let's move on.

1516
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:55,340
Loki, what do you have for us?

1517
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:56,340
All right.

1518
01:09:56,340 --> 01:10:02,540
So, um, splatoon two, unfortunately a lot of the games on the switch are running into

1519
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:03,540
hacker issues.

1520
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:08,540
Um, and apparently splatoon two is one of these games that's actually pretty easy for

1521
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:10,340
players to hack.

1522
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:15,340
So what did one, um, hacker do to splatoon two?

1523
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:21,780
Well, they took, um, the leaderboard for competitive play and put up, they got the top four spots

1524
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:28,840
and spelled out, please add anti-cheat basically said it wasn't just a joke.

1525
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:34,540
They wanted to send a message to Nintendo about how easy it is to hack their game.

1526
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:40,040
So yeah, because you know, now with all the mods and stuff that they have for the switch,

1527
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:45,940
it's easy for them to modify the game and be able to, you know, do all sorts of nonsense

1528
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:46,940
in there.

1529
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:49,140
I'll show you hacks the planet.

1530
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:50,140
Yeah.

1531
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:54,740
So, I mean, did Nintendo like fix this already or what?

1532
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:56,160
No, not yet.

1533
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,160
Not yet.

1534
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,160
They probably will.

1535
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,360
And by the time this show is airing, I'm sure it will pretty well.

1536
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,360
They've done it.

1537
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:06,160
Well, they fixed it by removing the hacker's message, um, and says, but the recent update,

1538
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:10,760
there's no signs of anti-cheat measures that have been added into the game and says what

1539
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:11,760
they should do.

1540
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:16,320
And in the least is to add parameters, to check things like they did in the first game,

1541
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,180
the correct misconfigured parameters.

1542
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:22,480
When someone joins a game on top of that, the game should have various sanity checks

1543
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,480
during gameplay.

1544
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:29,080
So basically, you know, like to verify that, Oh, the rate of fire of your rocket there

1545
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:35,120
isn't like, you know, it's a consistent amount and not like 80 times per second or something

1546
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,120
like that.

1547
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:41,540
Um, let's see, uh, going to chat at live.vognetwork.com, uh, dar Tetsuya says, I heard the guy got

1548
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:42,540
banned.

1549
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:43,540
So I don't know if that counts.

1550
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:44,540
Oh yes.

1551
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:45,540
Thank you.

1552
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:48,000
You know, of course, because he won't come back under it with a new hat.

1553
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,720
Well, it's still, it's, I understand like the guy wasn't trying to be destructive about

1554
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,720
it.

1555
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,200
He's like trying to tell him, Hey, you need to fix something.

1556
01:11:55,200 --> 01:12:00,280
And so how they reward that by fucking banning him, uh, going to chat here, here's another

1557
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,660
comment about eighties TV.

1558
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:02,660
You ready?

1559
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:03,660
All right.

1560
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:04,660
I'm ready.

1561
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:07,240
Uh, I had two in our chat, which is a, I don't recognize that name.

1562
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,240
So welcome.

1563
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,240
Hello.

1564
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:13,140
I had two and Chad says, I have a channel here in Richmond called antenna TV that has

1565
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:16,880
small wonder soap, Mr. Belvedere Benson.

1566
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,100
It's pretty rad.

1567
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,200
You know, that's, that's a good point.

1568
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:25,400
Is that a lot of these like random fucking shit is ever since they converted from the

1569
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:30,120
analog to the digital, because it got so much easier to do digital stations like check your

1570
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,120
digital stuff.

1571
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,880
Cause I don't even know if all these exist on cable.

1572
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:39,320
You might have to actually go to like the antenna and go to like, go to like your CBS,

1573
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:46,480
but go to like the dot two and the dot three because there is some low budget television

1574
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,160
happening in those places.

1575
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:50,760
And sometimes it's just like a nonstop weather channel.

1576
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:52,560
Some of them are like a nonstop news channel.

1577
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:56,020
Uh, some of them, you know, they're just like, like different stuff.

1578
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:57,280
Radio does this too.

1579
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:02,600
Uh, there's like random radio stations on the HD, but I don't think a lot of cars have

1580
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,600
like the HD radio.

1581
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:08,280
I don't, I think that's more of like a, I, my car, my old car had an HD radio tuner or

1582
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:14,480
I had, I had a NHC radio tuner in my car and it was garbage.

1583
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:19,640
Like I have a, I have a Prius, which is a, you know, and it's a, it's a 2016 Prius.

1584
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:23,560
It's kind of a newer car caught on because people are like, ah, streaming services, streaming

1585
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:30,640
services, you know, podcasts like satellite radio, putting your iPod or iPhone or whatever,

1586
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:36,480
or Android, you know, all that stuff into the, you know, uh, car basically is, is kind

1587
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:37,480
of the new thing.

1588
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,640
And everybody's using streaming Spotify or, or podcasts.

1589
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:43,000
And I'm sure there's a lot of people that listen to us in the car on their commutes.

1590
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Hello.

1591
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:47,840
So anyway, uh, but I was gonna say with the TV, that is so true.

1592
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,960
There is a lot of that random stuff and I bet anything, the channel that he's mentioning

1593
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,280
is probably one of those type of channels.

1594
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,920
That's where buzzer comes from too.

1595
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:58,760
Y'all know I love me some buzzer on Twitch cause they stream it on Twitch too, which

1596
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,840
is the old ass game shows.

1597
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,000
It's like seventies match game.

1598
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:09,360
And so the one over the air is the one that has like supermarket sweep and like additional

1599
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,600
stuff that they don't even have on the Twitch one.

1600
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,040
So, and I guess somebody was telling me, I think I saw a tweet.

1601
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:19,200
You can watch like a live feed of buzzer also on their website or something.

1602
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,960
So kind of, kind of neat.

1603
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:21,960
Anyway.

1604
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:25,140
Uh, Tyler Kalan chat says, who listens to radio anymore?

1605
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:26,600
There's nothing good on it.

1606
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,240
Internet radio for the win.

1607
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:31,320
I do once in a while.

1608
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:36,880
And the reason why is that I do find the one thing that local TV and local radio still

1609
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:42,960
are able to do that no one else can quite match is local news.

1610
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:48,600
That's the one place that they still do very well with, especially in the TV side of things

1611
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:49,600
with radio.

1612
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:54,820
There's just not a lot of like locally, but you know, the terrestrial radio would be very

1613
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:57,600
smart to embrace more of the community side of things.

1614
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,560
Cause that's how they get more people to listen to it.

1615
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:03,320
I think anyway, that's my thoughts on that.

1616
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:08,560
Um, let's move on and talk about, uh, smash brothers.

1617
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:14,260
So a super smash brothers may be going to be getting a demo, maybe.

1618
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:16,960
Uh, I think some of the other smash brothers games had demos.

1619
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,600
I seem to remember there was one on like 3d, it was one on 3d S soon to remember.

1620
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:26,240
Um, so anyway, uh, splatoon two and arms, they had demos, you know, to test launches

1621
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:27,520
or whatever you want to call it.

1622
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:31,480
Um, maybe in that sense, like it's a beta test type thing.

1623
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:37,600
IGN, uh, talked with bill Trinen at, uh, the San Diego comic con and the response was

1624
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,560
very good question right now.

1625
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,840
They're focused very much on getting the game ready.

1626
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:45,200
We have a few other things to talk about down the road between now and when it launches

1627
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:50,080
in December, we'll hopefully have some news on that as we get closer to launch.

1628
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:54,160
And uh, that could also mean, I guess the characters, they're kind of talking about,

1629
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,640
you know, more characters getting revealed before December.

1630
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:01,000
But I think kind of like soccer, I said in that early video, don't expect like a thousand

1631
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
new characters.

1632
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,160
Like there's probably going to be, I want 2000 new characters, be a couple more.

1633
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,160
That's it.

1634
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:12,800
All of the characters, uh, every single Pokemon from all of the generations in there.

1635
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:18,480
So interesting is apparently, uh, because smash brothers ultimate is listed on the official

1636
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:24,360
Japanese Nintendo website, 16 gigs of space is what the game is going to require.

1637
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:27,040
They say 16 gigs or more.

1638
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:32,000
So, um, if you're going to use internal storage for this, that's like over half your internal

1639
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
storage.

1640
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Why?

1641
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,640
What, what could possibly take up that much space?

1642
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:44,880
All those fucking characters and the animations in what I assume will be 60 frames a second.

1643
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:45,880
There's just a lot going on.

1644
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:49,400
Anyway, it might be a good time to think about getting a micro SD card if you don't already

1645
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,400
have one.

1646
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,560
I finally, I bought a micro SD card.

1647
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:53,600
I got a 128 gigabyte one.

1648
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,800
I think I got, I think I got a 120.

1649
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:56,800
I don't even know now.

1650
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:57,800
It was 40 bucks.

1651
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:58,800
Never going to be enough.

1652
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,800
It's never going to be enough.

1653
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:00,800
It was 40 bucks.

1654
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:05,520
And then like the very next, so I bought it at Best Buy and then the very next day was

1655
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:12,480
that Amazon prime fuck show and it was like 19 bucks on Amazon prime, but I didn't end

1656
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:17,080
up getting anything on the prime thing because I was like, there's this, I feel like a lot

1657
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:21,200
of that stuff is just trying to entice me to buy shit I don't really need.

1658
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:24,720
They had, I really just, they had a Fitbit I wanted, but I still didn't buy it.

1659
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:27,880
I looked at clothes, but I didn't see anything that screamed at me.

1660
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:28,880
So I didn't do it.

1661
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,120
They have a lot of garbage on there.

1662
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,120
Anyway.

1663
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,120
All right.

1664
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,120
Moving on.

1665
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:37,240
Uh, let's talk about Jamie.

1666
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,240
Let's talk about you.

1667
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,240
No.

1668
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:40,240
Jamie has a story for us.

1669
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:41,240
Neopets.

1670
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,240
Who remembers Neopets?

1671
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,240
Me.

1672
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:44,240
Me.

1673
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,240
Oh my God.

1674
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:46,240
I haven't fed my Neopet in 13 years.

1675
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:47,240
Do you think it's dead?

1676
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,240
Uh, they never die.

1677
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,060
Do you think it slowly died in the ice age?

1678
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:51,060
Like the dinosaurs?

1679
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:52,060
They never die.

1680
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:58,420
But anyway, um, there, we're gonna have a return of Neopets as a mobile app that will

1681
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:00,460
be, uh, puzzle games.

1682
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:05,140
It looks like, uh, there is going to be like a Scrabble game.

1683
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:10,140
Um, but it is gonna be different, you know, than the Neopets account.

1684
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:14,100
So if you still had your Neopets account for some reason or another, yeah, you've lost

1685
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:15,100
all that shit.

1686
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,660
But, I don't know.

1687
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:20,140
I mean, what are we gonna get next?

1688
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:22,220
Gaia online.

1689
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:23,220
Why not?

1690
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:24,220
You know what?

1691
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:26,060
Uh, Club Penguin.

1692
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:28,820
I think I still have my two Gaia online accounts.

1693
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:29,820
Do you?

1694
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:30,820
Uh, Ragnaros, of course.

1695
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:36,380
But there actually is a Ragnaros, uh, that little, uh, Ragnarock, sorry, I'm, I'm getting

1696
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:40,420
my, uh, Heroes of the Storm bug, uh, crossed.

1697
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:44,220
Uh, yes, Ragnarock online and then there, but they have that phone game.

1698
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:48,300
Private, well, private servers are still up, again, I'm playing, um, Idle Poring.

1699
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:49,300
That's it.

1700
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:51,700
Actually, uh, RO2 is free, still on Steam.

1701
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:52,820
Oh, that's cool.

1702
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:55,300
And it, all the music in it was done by Yoko Kanno, so.

1703
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:56,380
Oh, cool.

1704
01:18:56,380 --> 01:19:01,700
So it was really cute, I mean, it, it was just more of the same, you know.

1705
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:04,860
So are you gonna check out the new, the Neopets Reborn?

1706
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:07,120
Yeah, probably, cause I like Scrabble.

1707
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,780
The mutated Neopets.

1708
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:10,860
Well, I like word games.

1709
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:12,860
Hardcore Neopets.

1710
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:13,860
I like word games.

1711
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:19,260
Yes, but the only words you're able to spell are, like, violence, kill your parents, um,

1712
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:26,180
murder your stinky poop, worship Satan, uh, anyway, I worship Santa.

1713
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:27,180
I'm just kidding.

1714
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:28,180
None of that is funny.

1715
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,180
All right.

1716
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:30,180
Uh, Loki.

1717
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:36,740
All right, um, so there, one of the things, the stories that came out, um, while we were

1718
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:40,500
out was this whole thing about aliens, Colonial Marines.

1719
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:46,420
So there was a bug in the AI that had to do with actually, it was just one thing that

1720
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:53,020
was misspelled, one, um, line that was misspelled in there was causing some issues where the

1721
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:59,140
AI didn't know which room it was in, so it couldn't react to the player in, like, very

1722
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:03,140
intelligent ways, and which is why, you know, the AI was really dumb.

1723
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:09,800
So, um, you know, fast forward to now, where that's been fixed by, you know, fixing the

1724
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,340
typo in the INI file.

1725
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:19,320
And now, Gearbox has apparently taken to putting up a, I don't know, it looks like a fake job

1726
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:25,980
posting on their site, um, to kind of poke fun at the stupid mistake that they made.

1727
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:33,460
Um, so, apparently the site has a job listing for programming copy editor, specific duties

1728
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:41,140
of review all code for typos, desired skills and experience, enjoys finding typos, required

1729
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:47,040
skills and experience, click apply and pass a rigorous questionnaire located on the application.

1730
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:52,560
The questionnaire, I guess, is referring to, um, and the listing consists of the same question

1731
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,180
in an open text box.

1732
01:20:54,180 --> 01:21:02,860
Please respond to the correct spelling of tether or tether, teether, I guess.

1733
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:07,760
I mean, yeah, haha, it's fun to poke fun at yourself, but haha, this has been broken forever

1734
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:11,500
and you didn't fucking go through to see if you can fix the problem.

1735
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:16,380
Like a spelling error, you would think that that would be something pretty easy to catch

1736
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:19,440
and you just said, fuck it, who cares?

1737
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:24,300
So I kind of find it a little bit insulting that they poke fun at that.

1738
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:29,680
I'm of two mindsets because I always enjoy a company that can have that sense of like

1739
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,900
self-deprecating humor a little bit.

1740
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:37,440
You know, who doesn't love the Wendy's social media account or, um, who else is, who else

1741
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:44,000
is a sass on Twitter, Denny's Arby's Arby's, you know, all those, but here's the thing

1742
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,820
in the time it took to write that clever little tweet and pace or, and post that fake job

1743
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:53,840
posting and all that, um, you could have probably fixed this problem.

1744
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:54,840
You know what I mean?

1745
01:21:54,840 --> 01:22:00,180
Like, well, I mean, obviously this was an incredibly simple thing to fix and it's, it's

1746
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:02,860
really weird that it just was not found.

1747
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:03,860
I just don't understand.

1748
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:06,180
Like, did, did no one like go through that?

1749
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:08,400
I mean, well, and here's the thing that I don't understand too.

1750
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:13,400
On top of that, it's like, okay, you built this game and you shipped the game.

1751
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:17,280
You obviously, I assume you tested the game.

1752
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:20,000
Didn't you see that there was something fucking wrong with it?

1753
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
And like, wouldn't you think, okay, this is AI related.

1754
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,880
I'm going to talk to the guy that built, you know, the AI portion of this engine or whatever

1755
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:31,180
and figure out, let's see if we can get down to what the issue is.

1756
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:35,240
Like did, it seems like no one fucking did anything.

1757
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:36,240
Here's the thing.

1758
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:42,780
A lot of times in the industry, my understanding is that some bugs are reported and an executive

1759
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:46,660
decision is made to keep the game on track to release a certain time.

1760
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:47,660
They don't fix them.

1761
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:50,900
Just, it just depends on the severity of the bug, what it does and all that stuff.

1762
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:53,580
Some bugs don't get fixed and it is a choice.

1763
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:59,620
The weird thing about this though, this like with this easy of a fix as it is, it's not

1764
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:03,300
like we're talking about, you have to go in and like fix all this.

1765
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:08,840
This is a very, it's one character, like I could probably, I could fix an INI file.

1766
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:11,840
If I can fucking do it, they can fucking do it.

1767
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:20,180
So it is really weird to me how that whole thing like snuck through, like that's a disaster.

1768
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:23,840
As we were talking about earlier, you know, someone mentioned that, oh, hey, why don't

1769
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,880
developers just abandon their game and not fix stuff?

1770
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:27,880
Boom.

1771
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:28,880
There you go.

1772
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:29,880
Gearbox.

1773
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:30,880
They're your man.

1774
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:35,660
You know that they're there for you to not fix shit.

1775
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:37,660
There you go.

1776
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:39,220
Look forward to Borderlands 3.

1777
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:45,580
All right, anyway, speaking of typos ruining everything, some people really perked up this

1778
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:49,960
week when apparently Microsoft said that there was going to be an announcement with all new

1779
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:56,020
Xbox hardware and people were like, well, it is time for Gamescom.

1780
01:23:56,020 --> 01:24:00,860
So I mean, even though it's a weird time for a company to announce new hardware, what is

1781
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:03,720
what is the traditional calendar for this stuff anymore?

1782
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:04,720
Right?

1783
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:08,000
Remember, the switch came out in March and it did great.

1784
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,980
So timetables for game consoles even are screwed up these days.

1785
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:15,160
So a lot of people perked up and said, why?

1786
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:19,840
Microsoft's going to be like doing the new console this early or doing something.

1787
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,660
Well, here's the deal.

1788
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:24,840
It was kind of a typo, basically.

1789
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:31,260
So what ended up happening is that Major Nelson put out a tweet that said the wording

1790
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:36,560
in the original post that said all new hardware and accessories was inaccurate.

1791
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:41,720
What you're really going to get, you get new bundle and accessory news that's being shared

1792
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:42,720
in Germany.

1793
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:49,020
So what I meant to say is, you know, instead of wood, it's actually wooden.

1794
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:54,300
There wouldn't be any news for for new all new hardware.

1795
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,200
Sorry for the confusion.

1796
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,000
He asked and they said it was OK.

1797
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:08,000
Well, what happened is that we had to ask Sony if it was OK for us to unveil the new

1798
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,680
hardware. And Sony said it was OK.

1799
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,160
And Sony said it was OK.

1800
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:14,400
So he said we would.

1801
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:15,400
I mean, what?

1802
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:25,700
Here, I thought this was just going to be another slow episode of the show, and that's

1803
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:30,020
probably one of my favorite zingers that's come up in the past, like, year on this program.

1804
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:36,340
Anyway, new hardware and accessories.

1805
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:41,820
So, yeah, exciting, I guess that that does mean, you know, made it cheaper, you know,

1806
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:44,780
serious. I thought they were supposed to have like a redesigned controller or something

1807
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,320
that was supposed to be coming out at some point, because I know that they were having

1808
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:49,320
like a new controller of some sort.

1809
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:54,760
I thought maybe maybe I'm mistaken, but I thought they had like a new accessory or

1810
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,080
controller or something that was coming out.

1811
01:25:56,080 --> 01:26:00,160
So that's probably what you're going to see a games com, but not like how you are.

1812
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,600
Maybe no HoloLens.

1813
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:06,520
I would love for HoloLens to come down in price.

1814
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:10,040
That's just it doesn't that doesn't seem like a games com type of thing.

1815
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:14,560
Yeah, I think that's a, you know, CS, CS or a GD.

1816
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:19,200
Like the next phase of what that looks like type of thing for developers.

1817
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:20,400
I don't know. That's too early.

1818
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:26,920
Anyway, let's get to let's get to a more, you know, redesign, you know, VR controllers.

1819
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:29,480
Sony, can we please get something?

1820
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,840
All right, let's get to a simpler timing game.

1821
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,320
Let's go back to a time when there wasn't VR.

1822
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:37,360
You didn't have VR. Actually, no, we had VR back in this time.

1823
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:38,880
It was just it was lawnmower.

1824
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:43,440
Yeah, lawnmower. The mind's eye, it was all the mind's eye.

1825
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:45,540
All the VR like footage of the mind's eye.

1826
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:50,380
Yeah, it's it's the classic game of the week.

1827
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:53,760
Dark Sakura goes to the gaming ball, blah, blah, blah.

1828
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,220
Play this game, blah, blah, blah.

1829
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:55,660
What is it?

1830
01:26:55,660 --> 01:27:00,620
Hey, I have this game, Blazing Lasers, also known as Gunhead in Japan,

1831
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:05,460
which is a space shooter done by Hudson Soft and Compile.

1832
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:08,980
So, you know, it's kind of sometimes a pain in the ass.

1833
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:16,520
But it came out in Japan and North America in 1989 for the NEC PC Engine,

1834
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,760
also known as the TurboGrafx-16 over here.

1835
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,040
It's based off of the Japanese film called Gunhead,

1836
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:25,400
although they removed references to the movie in North America.

1837
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:29,400
Now that I know this, I might actually have to watch this movie,

1838
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:31,080
so I'm going to go look for it.

1839
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:37,040
Anyway, in the game, the galaxy is under attack by an any space

1840
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:42,260
called the Dark Squadron, and so the only thing that can help them

1841
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:47,100
is the Gunhead Advanced Starfighter, which would be pronounced GASK.

1842
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:54,460
Anyway, so it is a vertical scrolling shooter and you go and you blow shit up.

1843
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,060
It was actually developed by the same people who did Puyo Puyo

1844
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:03,700
and Super Bomberman, as well as Xanax, The Guardian Legend,

1845
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:09,640
and Doremi Fantasy, which that was Mylon's Doki Doki Adventures.

1846
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,280
And it has since been released on the Wii Virtual Console in North America,

1847
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:20,480
Europe and Australia in 2007 and in Japan the following year,

1848
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:25,880
and on the PlayStation Network in 2010 and on the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2014.

1849
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:32,040
So basically, you know, this is I'd probably say, you know, keep in mind

1850
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:36,560
the PC Engine got a shit ton of shooters.

1851
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:39,600
I mean, an inordinate amount of shooters.

1852
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,280
Some of them were garbage.

1853
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,180
Some of them were amazing.

1854
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:48,680
And I'm actually pretty happy that Blazing Lasers came out over here

1855
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:51,120
because it was a ridiculously good game

1856
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:55,560
when we kind of got some garbage on Turbo Grappler.

1857
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:01,800
In this game, you have a rapid fire cannon that you can upgrade

1858
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:06,320
or you can change other weapons into power ups and these orbs called gel capsules.

1859
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:11,560
You can also get multi bodies that shadow your action.

1860
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:15,240
They have homing missiles, shields, different firing capability

1861
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:19,740
called full fire, and you get cluster bombs, all kinds of just fun weapons.

1862
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:22,580
But of course, my favorite is the big laser cannon

1863
01:29:22,580 --> 01:29:24,940
that makes me think of Raiden.

1864
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:28,520
You remember Raiden, of course, Raiden is one of those games.

1865
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,780
Um, is that what the wavy gravy or whatever?

1866
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:37,420
Well, the one in Raiden just latches on and swirls around until it gets them.

1867
01:29:37,420 --> 01:29:40,660
But this one will actually, I think, shoot up and home in on them.

1868
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:43,520
Like in like 90 degree angles.

1869
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,160
It's just a really, really cool weapon.

1870
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:49,200
But yeah, other things that they did together.

1871
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:51,540
I mean, basically the people who are behind this.

1872
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:56,340
It was directed by Nittani Masamitsu, who is also called Roo.

1873
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,160
Um, but he was the creator of Zanac.

1874
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:04,640
He's the creator of the Guardian Legend, you know, and the PLPL series.

1875
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:09,100
We just had such an amazing cast on this.

1876
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:12,240
That's probably why this is still one of my favorite shooters, because

1877
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:17,780
it had so many of those things in common with the Guardian Legend.

1878
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:20,320
It was as far as power ups and the way that it moved.

1879
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,520
But it was really, really solid.

1880
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:28,940
Um, it was really listed as one of the best,

1881
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:30,820
I would say, 8-bit shooters.

1882
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:33,680
Just keep in mind, the turbo graphics is not a 16-bit system.

1883
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:36,220
It is still, it's still an 8-bit

1884
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:41,260
processor with a 16-bit graphic processor.

1885
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:46,560
Yeah, it's like a weird hybrid.

1886
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,300
And on top of that, Blazing Lasers was

1887
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:55,120
probably the big thing that people were getting when they were playing our title.

1888
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:58,920
So I would say, you know, if no one here has played it

1889
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:03,160
or they've seen like the kind of crappy artwork that came on the turbo chip,

1890
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:06,300
you know, in the U.S., don't let that fool you.

1891
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:09,700
It's kind of like how I look at Master System game art, you know,

1892
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,400
where it's kind of generic looking.

1893
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:15,380
Um, this is an excellent game.

1894
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:17,540
If you haven't played it, why the fuck not?

1895
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:21,100
And that's it, Blazing Lasers, a.k.a.

1896
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:23,560
Gunhead. Now I'm going to find the movie.

1897
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:25,760
All right. There it is.

1898
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,860
Classic game of the week, Blazing Lasers.

1899
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:29,600
Dude, this poster looks awesome.

1900
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:34,140
All right. OK, I need

1901
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:36,080
I think they have a ship in it called the Marianne.

1902
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:38,640
I think I actually did play this game once. It's pretty rad.

1903
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:39,940
I like that game.

1904
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:41,540
So, all right.

1905
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:44,340
We're going to take a break, but there is more Orange Laundry to come.

1906
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:46,680
We have rapid fire news when we get back.

1907
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:48,360
Travel around the world and look at some release dates.

1908
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:50,900
We're going to talk a little bit about accessibility in games.

1909
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:54,140
Some efforts to help developers make more aware about that.

1910
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:56,900
And we'll talk a little bit about Mega Man and some of the Mega Man news

1911
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:59,600
at a Comic-Con that I'm sure Loki is thrilled about.

1912
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:02,640
We'll get to that when we come back with more of Orange Laundry.

1913
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:04,540
Holy shit. The U.S.

1914
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:06,740
DVD of this is seventy seven dollars.

1915
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:08,720
How dare you interrupt my outro?

1916
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:11,240
All right. As I was saying,

1917
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:14,580
we'll be right back with more about Orange Laundry right after this.

1918
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:24,320
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight.

1919
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:30,300
Episode number 738 of our show for this July 22nd of 2018.

1920
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:35,340
Already in progress with myself, Dark Soccer and Loki all here in studio

1921
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:38,300
as we will plan to be over the next few weeks.

1922
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:41,920
No shows, although unexpected things happen, such as happened last week.

1923
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:44,580
But for the most part, should be here for the next few weeks.

1924
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:47,120
The next show we're going to have off, though, is Labor Day weekend,

1925
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,260
as has become typical over the past few years.

1926
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:51,820
I don't think we've done a show on Labor Day weekend in probably

1927
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:54,660
about six or seven years because I've been going to Dragon Con every year

1928
01:32:54,660 --> 01:32:56,600
since since VOG was a thing.

1929
01:32:56,600 --> 01:33:00,060
So, yeah, I'm really looking forward to this year's Dragon Con.

1930
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:02,660
I can't say anything officially about the schedule yet

1931
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,340
because it's not set in stone yet.

1932
01:33:04,340 --> 01:33:09,340
But stay tuned to my Twitter and VOG network for not just my schedule,

1933
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:12,040
but we have a lot of representation from the different VOG shows

1934
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:15,300
that'll be there at the Dragon Con this year.

1935
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,140
I know, of course, Bobby should be doing some stuff as well.

1936
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:22,840
But some of our other shows, I know, I don't know who all is confirmed

1937
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:26,680
going this year, but I know usually like John from Critical Myth

1938
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:29,020
and Gary from Critical Myth will probably be there.

1939
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:32,500
Brian from British Invaders should be back this year.

1940
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,720
So, you know, hopefully we'll have some representation

1941
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:37,400
across some of the other TV and other media panels as well.

1942
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:39,700
So looking forward to it.

1943
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:42,460
In the meantime, let's move on with some more gaming news

1944
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:45,000
and some rapid fire news going to Loki.

1945
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,440
Yep. So we can talk a little bit about, you know, free updates.

1946
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:51,900
As we were mentioning, Nomad Sky getting a pretty decent free update soon.

1947
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:56,780
The Nintendo Switch is getting an update to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

1948
01:33:57,180 --> 01:34:01,680
So with that, you're going to be getting a Breath of the Wild

1949
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:05,460
Breath of the Wild skinned version of the Master Cycle,

1950
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,720
which is going to be something that's free as well.

1951
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:14,660
You can also get the tunic from Breath of the Wild as well.

1952
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:17,880
So that'll be updated for Link.

1953
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:22,700
They said also there is going to have some ancient customization parts

1954
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:26,460
will be added to the other games, cars and paragliders.

1955
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:29,300
So you can change it up a bit.

1956
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:32,360
Not bad for free.

1957
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,440
JD and chat confirmed me that's already live.

1958
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:35,540
Yeah, in the game. Yeah.

1959
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:36,660
So I'm curious.

1960
01:34:36,660 --> 01:34:40,260
So like, why release it now?

1961
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:41,260
I mean, that's that's neat.

1962
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:43,940
I wonder if they have any other announcements that they're going.

1963
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:46,800
Or is there still more DLC coming out for Breath of the Wild?

1964
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:52,340
I think is there are the two big ones already happened.

1965
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:55,020
But who knows? They might do more.

1966
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:58,680
I still have to purchase it again because I remember I sold it when I got

1967
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:01,520
my got rid of the Wii U.

1968
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:04,720
So I saw they get I never played through it, honestly.

1969
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:07,780
I mean, I was going to pick it up when it gets cheap.

1970
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:10,440
Mm hmm. So I just that's a big time sink.

1971
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:13,280
And I got to play Skyrim a couple more times, I'm sure.

1972
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:16,880
Of course, Skyrim and 4K. It's 4K now.

1973
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:19,960
Why not? I'm in VR.

1974
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:22,520
And then something else coming to the switch, actually.

1975
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:25,060
So you may remember South Park.

1976
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:28,260
The Fractured But Whole did come to the Nintendo Switch.

1977
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,500
What's also going to be coming, though, is the Stick of Truth.

1978
01:35:31,540 --> 01:35:33,500
That is also going to be coming to the switch.

1979
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:38,120
And then along with that, on all platforms, though, is the brand new DLC

1980
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:42,900
for South Park Fractured But Whole, the Bring the Crunch,

1981
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:46,960
which is a new, I guess, campaign

1982
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:51,300
which introduces a new class to its battle system

1983
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:54,980
and has, I guess, some aliens.

1984
01:35:55,480 --> 01:36:00,180
The mint berry crunch, which is an alien from Coco John.

1985
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:05,200
I don't know, but it does take place in the

1986
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,540
was it late Lake Tardicaca.

1987
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:13,900
Wow. So that's going to be kind of on

1988
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:18,380
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch and PC, July 31st.

1989
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:20,320
It'll cost eleven ninety nine.

1990
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,780
I can't remember this as part of the season pass.

1991
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:23,720
I have the season pass.

1992
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:26,480
I think if I remember correctly, I bought it with the season pass.

1993
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,760
So I need to go back and play that because it was a great game.

1994
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,080
All right.

1995
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:36,080
Going to a couple more stories for you guys, starting with the Stardew Valleys multiplayer.

1996
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:40,140
That is going live on the PC version of the game, August 1st.

1997
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:42,980
Console multiplayer to follow after that.

1998
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:47,480
There is a new trailer that you can watch that details all of this that came out on the Internet

1999
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:52,080
that also shows the new farms that look really, really good.

2000
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:58,160
So you can check that out over on YouTube or pretty much any gaming blog that probably ran the multiplayer update.

2001
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:01,040
It's a good, relaxing, like

2002
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,740
Animal Crossing style game, if you like that type of thing.

2003
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:08,920
Yeah, I got to admit, I I I couldn't really get totally sucked into Stardew Valley

2004
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:11,580
because it didn't really like it didn't guide me enough.

2005
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:14,980
And I didn't like I couldn't really figure out like what I was really supposed to be doing.

2006
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:16,820
And so it felt I don't know.

2007
01:37:16,820 --> 01:37:20,260
It's not really anything you're supposed to be a little too open ended to me.

2008
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:22,660
If that's I need my games to have a little more structure.

2009
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:25,020
Well, they have like the whole system where you can,

2010
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:29,460
you know, unlock stuff in the community center.

2011
01:37:29,460 --> 01:37:34,700
So that kind of gets you going in different directions to try to like, you know, grow different things or whatever.

2012
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:40,400
And then there's a relationship you can try to, you know, romance people in there.

2013
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:43,080
Maybe if somebody really wants to play the multiplayer,

2014
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:45,240
maybe I'll check it out again and get sucked in.

2015
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:48,440
Or the dude that wants you to go on the boat because of the implication, you know.

2016
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:53,480
Yeah, who knows? Anyway, I also news about Soulcalibur 6,

2017
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:56,480
which I'm looking forward to coming out later this year.

2018
01:37:57,180 --> 01:38:01,860
It was confirmed that we will be getting Voldo as another character in that game.

2019
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:06,460
So a lot of great characters from the past coming back for Soulcalibur 6,

2020
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:10,060
who, of course, is the hell guardian of the game.

2021
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:12,200
He's the one that has the creepy face mask.

2022
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:14,200
I would like spikes on his eyes and stuff.

2023
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:17,980
He looks kind of like weird, but he's back in Soulcalibur 6

2024
01:38:17,980 --> 01:38:22,640
for those that really enjoy his little like bendy fighting mechanics.

2025
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:28,640
October 19th, again, is the day to look forward to this on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

2026
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:31,640
Then did you see the the Arby's?

2027
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:36,920
I think it was cardboard like cosplay thing that they did for Soulcalibur.

2028
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,660
It was pretty, pretty epic.

2029
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:42,420
They they do a lot of that stuff, so I'm not too surprised.

2030
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:45,600
So, all right, Darsaco, what do you have for us?

2031
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,960
Oh, just stuff.

2032
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:53,720
We are getting a Sega Ages Sonic the Hedgehog Thunder Force 4 included

2033
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:58,660
a fantasy star and some more games.

2034
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:01,760
It looks like it's going to be coming out on.

2035
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:05,740
Hold on. Does it say it's on the switch?

2036
01:39:05,740 --> 01:39:06,740
Yeah, it's coming out on the switch.

2037
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:09,700
Well, there was also a mention of oh, yeah,

2038
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:13,880
Sonic will have different elements from the 3DS version, like the added spin dash

2039
01:39:14,860 --> 01:39:17,900
and the mega play arcade version.

2040
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:21,980
Thunder Force 4 will include Styx mode from the Sega Saturn version,

2041
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:23,720
and it will have leaderboards.

2042
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:27,080
Other ones are coming like Alex Kidd in Miracle World, Gain Ground,

2043
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:30,420
and like I said earlier, Fantasy Star.

2044
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:33,860
Also, well, you know,

2045
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:40,900
Team Instinct has been kind of the the whippin' boy of Pokemon Go because mad.

2046
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:43,860
I don't know if anyone else saw that comic.

2047
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:49,520
But Team Instinct has fully redeemed themselves at this year's Pokemon Go Fest.

2048
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:53,020
Team Mystic, what did I say?

2049
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:57,160
Yeah, Team Mystic was fairly looking smug,

2050
01:39:57,500 --> 01:40:01,940
according to what I remember reading on this,

2051
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:03,960
except it turned out that

2052
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:07,500
Team Instinct were

2053
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:13,580
the highest number of research tasks completed nine million.

2054
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:16,420
They've blown the other two teams out of the water.

2055
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:18,780
So good job, yellow team.

2056
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:23,120
So honestly, especially after now having reached max level in Ingress,

2057
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:25,820
let me tell you, the teams in Pokemon Go, they don't matter.

2058
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:28,820
It's mad. They don't. It's mad.

2059
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:32,800
Yeah, there's still no game yet.

2060
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,560
Well, I mean, there's no competitive game.

2061
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:36,700
It's not. Yeah, it's not a competitive game. Exactly.

2062
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:38,840
So, all right.

2063
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:41,040
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

2064
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:43,720
and some games that will be coming out soon in a store near you,

2065
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:45,500
starting with the U.S., Loki.

2066
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:47,040
Well, we have a few things coming out this week.

2067
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:50,600
So Mega Man X Legacy Collection is going to be coming out on PC,

2068
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:52,640
the Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2069
01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:55,780
Of course, you know, with No Man's Sky next,

2070
01:40:55,780 --> 01:40:58,780
the Xbox One version of No Man's Sky is going to be coming out

2071
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:05,660
with the Banner Saga 3 on PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2072
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:10,860
And then looks like Ys Memories of Celcita.

2073
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:13,100
And that's on PC.

2074
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:17,600
And Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation 2 on PlayStation 4.

2075
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:22,080
And let's see, last but not least, we've got

2076
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:25,240
Go Vacation on Nintendo Switch.

2077
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:29,120
And in a game I'm sure my kids will want to play for some stupid reason

2078
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:30,340
because they see it on YouTube.

2079
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:34,260
But Hello Neighbor is going to be coming out on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,

2080
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:36,520
iOS and Android.

2081
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:39,320
And it's a stealth survivor horror game

2082
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:41,240
about breaking into someone's house and trying to steal stuff

2083
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:42,740
while he tries to kill you. I don't know.

2084
01:41:42,740 --> 01:41:44,880
I know I've watched videos of it.

2085
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:45,740
That's it.

2086
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:50,180
All right, let's travel to Japan, where on the 26th of July,

2087
01:41:50,180 --> 01:41:53,360
we have Mysetsu Pier Station comes out.

2088
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:57,800
There's a regular version of this and one that comes with a figure as well.

2089
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:59,120
So that's kind of interesting.

2090
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:01,320
I don't know if you get to, like, you know,

2091
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:04,600
have sex with the figure or something, but I don't think it's that kind of game.

2092
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:07,840
What? That's a jump to conclusions there.

2093
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:12,080
Well, it just it just looks like another one of those.

2094
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:16,240
Anyway, this oh, God, this game based on the cover art for this game.

2095
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:19,680
This is more of the game that I think people are going to want to fornicate

2096
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:22,180
with fake versions of the characters.

2097
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:25,480
Senran Kagura, Peach Beach Splash.

2098
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:28,620
Oh, right. It's Senran Kagura. I mean, of course, that's right.

2099
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:32,460
The naughty ninja girls of Senran Kagura are going to be taking it.

2100
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:36,360
This is basically dead or alive beach volleyball, but it's squirt guns.

2101
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:38,300
Yeah, it's squirt guns and bikinis.

2102
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:40,500
That's right. White bikinis.

2103
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:42,700
So you know where this is going.

2104
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:46,620
Anyway, the Rockman X anniversary collection one and two.

2105
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:48,020
Obviously, that's what they call Mega Man over there.

2106
01:42:48,020 --> 01:42:50,500
That is also out on July 26th.

2107
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:55,100
And you can get a game called My Kai Senke Disgaea Refine.

2108
01:42:55,820 --> 01:42:59,220
I don't think that is the same Disgaea game.

2109
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:01,060
Oh, no, it is. It is the Disgaea series.

2110
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:03,460
So it's like probably some type of like definitive version.

2111
01:43:03,740 --> 01:43:05,260
That's pretty cool.

2112
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:11,420
And then a Dragon Quest X all in one package, versions one through four,

2113
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:14,260
also releasing in Japan this week,

2114
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:19,220
along with a game called Spin Tires Mud Runner is out in Japan this week.

2115
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:21,220
So it's a pretty busy week in Japan.

2116
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:24,220
A lot of games going into the PlayStation hits collection over there as well,

2117
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:28,300
including Bloodborne, Little Big Planet 3 and Ratchet and Clank the Game,

2118
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:30,340
as well as Last of Us Remastered.

2119
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:33,780
All of those come out on the 26th as well.

2120
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:35,620
And if that isn't enough,

2121
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:39,540
why not get the PlayStation 4 Monster Hunter World Value Pack?

2122
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:45,300
That is some type of, I think, system plus game type of bundle.

2123
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:49,540
That is pretty much it for the Sony stuff.

2124
01:43:49,540 --> 01:43:51,820
Looking quickly to see if Nintendo has anything.

2125
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:54,820
Yeah, Nintendo has the Rock Band collection as well.

2126
01:43:54,820 --> 01:43:59,700
That My Kai Senke Disgaea, the Disgaea remaster is over there as well.

2127
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:03,140
Wolfenstein II The New Colossus gets its Japanese remake.

2128
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:05,860
Dragon Quest 10 is out on the Switch in Japan,

2129
01:44:05,860 --> 01:44:08,300
so it's going to get that all in one package as well.

2130
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:14,820
And Daito Shouken no Hitsu Jikai Library Party.

2131
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:17,620
So ain't no party like a library party.

2132
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:20,980
Because the library party don't start until everyone shuts the fuck up.

2133
01:44:24,940 --> 01:44:29,260
All right. Stacks books moving on to the UK, Dark Sakura.

2134
01:44:29,420 --> 01:44:34,140
We have on the 24th Train Sim World for PlayStation and Xbox.

2135
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:38,220
We have on PlayStation the Persistence VR on the 25th.

2136
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:41,900
No Man's Sky on the 27th.

2137
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:45,940
Other things on the 27th is Hello Neighbor for Switch and PlayStation.

2138
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:49,340
Go Vacation on Switch.

2139
01:44:49,860 --> 01:44:52,980
The Banner Saga Trilogy Bonus Edition,

2140
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:56,020
also on the 27th for PlayStation and Xbox.

2141
01:44:56,020 --> 01:44:58,380
That's it.

2142
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:01,980
All right. Better than a shart.

2143
01:45:01,980 --> 01:45:04,740
This is the part of the show where we would get to the mailbag.

2144
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:07,540
If we had any emails.

2145
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:11,420
We need a sad version of that song, like in a minor key, minor key.

2146
01:45:11,420 --> 01:45:15,340
Yeah. Well, you should just start playing like the funeral dirge.

2147
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:20,820
So anyway, my point is to send us emails.

2148
01:45:20,980 --> 01:45:23,780
That was that was two weeks and no emails.

2149
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:25,420
I'm depressed now.

2150
01:45:25,420 --> 01:45:29,580
We got some people asking us to vote in a gubernatorial

2151
01:45:30,100 --> 01:45:32,180
thing in a state we don't have in that.

2152
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:34,780
Jeez. We haven't gotten any Russian porn spam, though.

2153
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:36,700
Well, that's a plus, I guess.

2154
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:38,740
That was something we used to get on the old email address, right?

2155
01:45:39,660 --> 01:45:43,260
That's a relief. Anyway, if you want to send us an email, please no spam.

2156
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:45,900
Participate at OrangeLoundTrader.com

2157
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:49,860
unless your spam comes with like Bitcoin or

2158
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:51,940
although I wouldn't know what to do with Bitcoin.

2159
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:57,700
I or, you know, a freak steam codes will take those two.

2160
01:45:57,860 --> 01:46:01,940
Where was I where they said that we take cryptocurrency?

2161
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:03,580
I was in San Francisco.

2162
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:06,060
It was somewhere like walking toward Saks.

2163
01:46:06,740 --> 01:46:09,460
And in the window it says we take cryptocurrency.

2164
01:46:09,460 --> 01:46:11,020
I'm like, you do.

2165
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:14,260
There's a lot of random places, especially in the Bay Area, that will take

2166
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:18,420
cryptocurrency as, you know, payment for whatever is the Dyson vacuum place.

2167
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:19,460
No, it wasn't the Dyson.

2168
01:46:19,460 --> 01:46:23,620
But there's a cryptocurrency ATM outside of

2169
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:26,700
the arcade that's in the Roswell Galleria.

2170
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:28,660
Yes, I've seen that.

2171
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:31,500
The I'm just like, why does this even exist?

2172
01:46:31,540 --> 01:46:34,300
Yeah, I don't I don't even understand how it works.

2173
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:36,140
This is this is where I start to go.

2174
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:37,620
I'm old. I'm 40.

2175
01:46:37,620 --> 01:46:41,580
Herp derp, because I don't I don't keep your dollars in a mattress.

2176
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:43,780
I would like one cryptocurrency, please.

2177
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:46,340
Yes, I would like one cryptocurrency.

2178
01:46:46,340 --> 01:46:51,340
And I want to make a cryptocurrency called cryptocurrency.

2179
01:46:51,380 --> 01:46:52,940
Can we do that? I mean, come on.

2180
01:46:52,940 --> 01:46:54,460
Everything's like something coin.

2181
01:46:54,460 --> 01:46:56,980
Let's just do I want cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency.

2182
01:46:57,660 --> 01:47:02,540
I would I would be so down with making VOG coin or if if Bobby Black Wolf

2183
01:47:02,540 --> 01:47:03,620
frowns on that, then fine.

2184
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:05,620
Oh, our coin. He can't stop us from doing that.

2185
01:47:05,620 --> 01:47:10,460
But I'm all for like a currency that we own.

2186
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:13,540
But the question would be, what are you going to buy with it?

2187
01:47:13,540 --> 01:47:16,020
Because that's how you're going to really give it value is

2188
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:22,940
make it worth something that like you can trade in one VOG coin for like X.

2189
01:47:23,140 --> 01:47:25,700
You know what I mean? Like me screaming at you.

2190
01:47:26,380 --> 01:47:28,580
I mean, one VOG coin for me to scream at you.

2191
01:47:28,580 --> 01:47:29,780
That's terrible. I hate that.

2192
01:47:29,780 --> 01:47:32,540
I'm surprised no one's made cryptocurrency for Shrewt books yet.

2193
01:47:33,020 --> 01:47:37,140
Technically, we kind of it's not like an actual cryptocurrency,

2194
01:47:37,140 --> 01:47:40,740
but technically we have like whose line is it anyway?

2195
01:47:40,740 --> 01:47:42,580
We have the points and the points don't matter.

2196
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:44,140
But you should still play the game anyway.

2197
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:47,500
That's all built into the website, which is why you get that passphrase

2198
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:48,620
that shows up during the show.

2199
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:52,340
If you're listening on the podcast or if you're listening live, remember, plug,

2200
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:56,260
plug, you just go to live.vognetwork.com and you can click the thing and you can,

2201
01:47:56,260 --> 01:47:57,140
you know, get points.

2202
01:47:57,340 --> 01:48:00,620
And once in a while, the site gives you loot when you do certain things.

2203
01:48:00,620 --> 01:48:02,060
It's like you build up your little profile.

2204
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:04,940
It's collect them all because why?

2205
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:07,740
Why do you why do you collect them and Pokemon go? Why not?

2206
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:09,300
So we do have that.

2207
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:10,740
We may not have our own cryptocurrency,

2208
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:13,780
but we have our own points and the points don't matter system.

2209
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:16,940
So anyway, let's see.

2210
01:48:16,940 --> 01:48:19,740
I'm looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

2211
01:48:20,340 --> 01:48:23,980
Let's see. Tiger class says, use VOG coins to buy games.

2212
01:48:23,980 --> 01:48:25,220
That would be one use for it.

2213
01:48:25,220 --> 01:48:28,300
OK, Loki's game will only be purchasable with VOG coins.

2214
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:31,460
Well, I can't wait to make zero money on that.

2215
01:48:32,820 --> 01:48:34,860
Oh, God. All right.

2216
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:40,420
Anyway, let's move on to some more video game news stories.

2217
01:48:40,420 --> 01:48:42,540
Loki. All right.

2218
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:44,740
Well, this is kind of cool.

2219
01:48:44,740 --> 01:48:51,060
So apparently there is this a game dev, I guess, a game maker's toolkit.

2220
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:55,540
It's basically a games writer by the name of Mark Brown.

2221
01:48:55,740 --> 01:49:01,340
And he takes deep dives on certain aspects of gaming from level design to music.

2222
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:04,820
So he started a new series now called Making Games Better.

2223
01:49:05,180 --> 01:49:10,020
And so with that, it's his first episode is basically making

2224
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:12,540
games better for the deaf and hard of hearing.

2225
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:14,580
So designing for disability.

2226
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:19,700
So that's pretty awesome that he's got this challenge kind of gives tips

2227
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:24,700
for game developers and how they can do different things for their games

2228
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:30,300
to be able to benefit, you know, these other demographics.

2229
01:49:30,340 --> 01:49:34,500
So, for example, with the designing for disability for deaf and hard of hearing,

2230
01:49:34,740 --> 01:49:37,980
he says, the thing is about video game subtitles, it's more important

2231
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:41,940
than any other medium that they're easy to read because you're trying to divide

2232
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:45,500
the your attention between subtitles and everything else you need to think about.

2233
01:49:45,820 --> 01:49:49,940
So, you know, they have he's got a whole bunch of tips.

2234
01:49:49,940 --> 01:49:52,940
He's going to be doing this series, I guess, for other aspects as well.

2235
01:49:53,340 --> 01:49:55,900
And if you want to check it out, you can.

2236
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:59,980
And then also he has a picture on, too, if you need to want to support that.

2237
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:05,860
But it's pretty neat to give it a look and see what they recommend.

2238
01:50:05,860 --> 01:50:11,420
But it's neat to see that there's resources out there to talk about accessibility,

2239
01:50:11,420 --> 01:50:21,060
because it's not really something that's brought up a lot in the game dev video tutorial series world.

2240
01:50:21,180 --> 01:50:23,940
Yeah, I think that's really cool just to like, you know, a lot of times,

2241
01:50:23,940 --> 01:50:26,140
99 percent of it is just like awareness.

2242
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:30,740
I made that statistic up, but it's just awareness, you know, like, oh,

2243
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:35,420
I could do this thing really easily, but if I didn't think to do it, I might not do it.

2244
01:50:35,700 --> 01:50:41,740
You know, and you can't like you have to put every little thing in a game that you make.

2245
01:50:41,740 --> 01:50:44,340
You know what I mean? Like what I mean by that is that like,

2246
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:49,180
OK, take my reading of the game Tempest 4000 earlier in the show is that like

2247
01:50:49,180 --> 01:50:53,660
they don't have options in it to like change the resolution or use the mouse

2248
01:50:53,860 --> 01:50:57,900
or remap the buttons because they just didn't put it in there.

2249
01:50:57,900 --> 01:50:58,780
You know what I mean?

2250
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:02,380
So it's like things like that developers kind of like have to put in their games.

2251
01:51:02,620 --> 01:51:06,420
And even though it might not necessarily be difficult, I don't know.

2252
01:51:06,420 --> 01:51:08,780
I don't I don't make a lot of games, but, you know,

2253
01:51:09,620 --> 01:51:13,260
it's just it's standard practice on PC to do that kind of stuff,

2254
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:14,780
even if you don't do it for console.

2255
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:19,420
But come on, you got to you got to realize that you're putting this on PC.

2256
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:20,580
You can't just like, yeah,

2257
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:23,620
let's copy and paste what I did in this other platform, put it out here. It's fine.

2258
01:51:23,620 --> 01:51:26,060
I know. But anyway, back to the topic at hand with the accessibility for like

2259
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:28,020
for the deaf and so forth.

2260
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:32,340
Like, I think it's really cool that, you know, to to just build that awareness.

2261
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:35,980
And, you know, things to do and, you know, what maybe not to do,

2262
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:39,380
what what color patterns might not be as good to use as certain other color

2263
01:51:39,380 --> 01:51:42,940
patterns to help people with certain color blindness and, you know, things like that.

2264
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:46,220
So pretty cool. All right.

2265
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:52,780
Let's move on and talk about a unveiling at Comic-Con this past weekend,

2266
01:51:52,780 --> 01:51:56,340
which is for Mega Man Fully Charged. That's right.

2267
01:51:56,340 --> 01:51:59,100
The full trailer for Mega Man Fully Charged came out.

2268
01:51:59,300 --> 01:52:01,860
And now you can check out what's going to be coming to the cartoon.

2269
01:52:01,860 --> 01:52:06,660
I watched so I watched the trailer and I watched also the episode one trailer.

2270
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:10,340
The trailer that they have for the whole series looks like hot shit.

2271
01:52:10,460 --> 01:52:11,100
Here it is right now.

2272
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:13,860
We're going to play it here in studio a little bit, just so,

2273
01:52:13,860 --> 01:52:17,100
because I want to see Jamie's take on this, too.

2274
01:52:21,100 --> 01:52:23,740
I don't someone to hate the look

2275
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:26,300
completely because it kind of reminds me of Tron,

2276
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:28,340
even though it does look a little cheap.

2277
01:52:28,340 --> 01:52:30,940
It looks very cheap.

2278
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:33,620
It does look like it was made on the cheap.

2279
01:52:33,620 --> 01:52:36,540
I don't know, I think I've watched it.

2280
01:52:36,540 --> 01:52:38,660
I try it. I try it.

2281
01:52:38,660 --> 01:52:40,980
And make a perfect decision from there, Jim.

2282
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:47,820
So we'll see. Anyway, I can barely hear anything, but I wonder if it's kind of based off the Mega Man EXE or

2283
01:52:47,860 --> 01:52:50,460
Rockman Battle No. No, it's it's garbage.

2284
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:52,780
He's got he's got Micro Man.

2285
01:52:52,780 --> 01:52:57,340
He's just like this little robot that lives in this helmet that like quips stupid shit.

2286
01:52:57,820 --> 01:52:59,420
Well, if you want to see for yourself,

2287
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:02,900
you can check out a preview on the Cartoon Network app on August 3rd,

2288
01:53:03,100 --> 01:53:06,540
and then it airs on the actual Cartoon Network on August 5th.

2289
01:53:06,660 --> 01:53:09,860
They had a preview, though, for like the first episode.

2290
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:14,580
They had like a trailer and it and show a little bit more in detail what it was like.

2291
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:19,860
And it's not as bad as that trailer, but it still looks bad.

2292
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:25,140
I mean, it's just it's the lowest like I don't know, like I get it.

2293
01:53:25,140 --> 01:53:27,100
It's not supposed to appeal to me.

2294
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:28,540
It's supposed to appeal to kids.

2295
01:53:28,540 --> 01:53:29,420
Kids might be into it?

2296
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:31,820
I don't know.

2297
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:34,300
I mean, they're into a lot of things like all of a sudden.

2298
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:40,940
But like with that in mind, OK, like, for example, they just put out a Captain Underpants cartoon

2299
01:53:40,940 --> 01:53:42,380
because the movie was kind of funny.

2300
01:53:42,380 --> 01:53:44,660
My kids read the books and I watched the cartoon.

2301
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:45,900
Well, I thought your kids could read.

2302
01:53:46,740 --> 01:53:48,180
My older kid can.

2303
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:49,780
My youngest cannot.

2304
01:53:49,780 --> 01:53:51,900
OK, my oldest, he can read just fine.

2305
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:55,940
OK, no, but like Captain and I read it to them as well.

2306
01:53:55,940 --> 01:54:04,380
So so we watched the cartoon in the cartoon is for it's structured like the book.

2307
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:06,020
And they have like chapters of seven.

2308
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:09,700
It's really well animated and it's funny, has good writing.

2309
01:54:11,260 --> 01:54:12,940
You know that they're into.

2310
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:15,700
But this is like kind of dumb.

2311
01:54:15,700 --> 01:54:18,420
This reminds me of like the Pac-Man cartoon that they had.

2312
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:19,660
And it's just as cheap.

2313
01:54:19,660 --> 01:54:25,380
Look, the animation looks just as cheap or maybe even like if I'm trying to think.

2314
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:28,660
What's something else that they like?

2315
01:54:28,660 --> 01:54:29,380
They like.

2316
01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:32,540
What's it called? It's.

2317
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:38,380
There's another show that is Disney.

2318
01:54:38,380 --> 01:54:40,340
I think it's Disney.

2319
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:44,020
It's they have like three ninjas or whatever.

2320
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:45,180
Oh, whatever doesn't matter.

2321
01:54:47,260 --> 01:54:48,980
But there's there's other cheaper cartoons.

2322
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:53,540
It's just I don't think when you see the animation, the animation is kind of cheap and

2323
01:54:53,580 --> 01:54:56,740
usually when they skimp on the animation like that, they're also skimping on the

2324
01:54:56,740 --> 01:55:01,740
writing and it's just like it gets tiring after a while and they get bored with it.

2325
01:55:01,740 --> 01:55:06,340
So unless there's something to really hook them in and make it interesting, I think

2326
01:55:06,340 --> 01:55:10,260
that it's just going to be kind of it's going to be there and then it's just they're

2327
01:55:10,260 --> 01:55:11,100
going to stop making it.

2328
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:14,540
Whatever, I mean, I'm not going to watch it.

2329
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:16,540
It looks dumb. I tried watching.

2330
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:21,340
I do like that they do some like flashback stuff when they're talking about different

2331
01:55:21,340 --> 01:55:26,420
things. It's like in a retro pixelated like sprite.

2332
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:30,140
They tell it like sprites and they have like sprite little cut, you know, animations

2333
01:55:30,140 --> 01:55:32,020
between scenes and stuff like that.

2334
01:55:32,140 --> 01:55:33,260
So that's neat.

2335
01:55:34,020 --> 01:55:35,980
But once again, who's that appealing to?

2336
01:55:35,980 --> 01:55:39,460
Is that supposed to appeal to me, the person that played the video games, or is it

2337
01:55:39,460 --> 01:55:40,540
supposed to appeal to a kid?

2338
01:55:40,540 --> 01:55:41,900
Kid doesn't give a shit about that.

2339
01:55:42,820 --> 01:55:48,340
I don't know. It's just I wish it was written in a way where like it appeals to all

2340
01:55:48,340 --> 01:55:50,020
audiences because you don't have to.

2341
01:55:50,020 --> 01:55:51,700
Why are you dumbing it down?

2342
01:55:51,700 --> 01:55:53,780
You don't have to dumb that shit down for kids.

2343
01:55:54,140 --> 01:55:56,620
We used to watch the fucking Batman anime series.

2344
01:55:56,620 --> 01:55:58,860
That wasn't fucking dumbed down for kids.

2345
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:03,700
You know, there are Darkwing Dockery, these like DuckTales and shit like I watched.

2346
01:56:03,700 --> 01:56:07,900
Like my my my favorite shit was the stuff that was like Tiny Toons and Animaniacs.

2347
01:56:07,940 --> 01:56:09,540
Exactly. True levels of humor.

2348
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:10,900
Exactly. Exactly.

2349
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:14,060
That was great. But old school Rocky and Bull angle.

2350
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:19,340
But nowadays, like even like Mickey Mouse, like my son watches my youngest and watches

2351
01:56:19,340 --> 01:56:23,620
Mickey Mouse stuff on his tablet, that shit's like fucking SpongeBob.

2352
01:56:23,620 --> 01:56:26,900
It's like I mean, not to say that SpongeBob is bad, because that's just that peels the

2353
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:29,220
stoner people and everybody.

2354
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:30,780
I mean, everybody loves SpongeBob, but it's stupid.

2355
01:56:30,940 --> 01:56:33,220
But it's like not as much as adventure time.

2356
01:56:33,220 --> 01:56:35,500
Oh, my God. Yes. Like I was so funny.

2357
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:37,500
You know, it's like it's like that.

2358
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:40,620
And that's fine. But it's not like it's not Mickey Mouse anymore.

2359
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:43,620
Nothing makes me want to smoke weed like episodes of Adventure Time.

2360
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:48,580
But yeah, but the new Mickey Mouse show is like fucking like Adventure Time or Ren

2361
01:56:48,580 --> 01:56:52,100
Sippy or something like that. It's just it's just fucking crazy.

2362
01:56:52,100 --> 01:56:55,740
If you watch that and I don't know, it just is weird.

2363
01:56:56,420 --> 01:57:00,380
But I guess it's just the demographic nowadays is the kids like that kind of crap.

2364
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:03,900
I mean, it's fine. It's more interesting than the other Mickey Mouse cartoons.

2365
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:06,060
And the DuckTales and new DuckTales is fucking awesome.

2366
01:57:06,620 --> 01:57:08,900
But I don't think this is going to be awesome.

2367
01:57:08,900 --> 01:57:10,420
This is going to be awesome. Like Sonic.

2368
01:57:11,060 --> 01:57:12,980
What's the Sonic show they have now?

2369
01:57:13,220 --> 01:57:15,820
That's shit. Sonic hero, Sonic Boom.

2370
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:18,540
Yeah. No one gives a shit about Sonic Boom.

2371
01:57:18,860 --> 01:57:22,180
No one's fucking like, oh, my God, I need to see the new episode of Sonic Boom.

2372
01:57:22,180 --> 01:57:25,100
I got to get home so I can watch. I got to watch my Sonic Boom.

2373
01:57:25,300 --> 01:57:26,900
No one fucking cares about that.

2374
01:57:27,140 --> 01:57:29,580
Like, no one's going to fucking care about this show either.

2375
01:57:30,820 --> 01:57:34,700
And that's what pisses me off. It's like more Capcom.

2376
01:57:35,620 --> 01:57:38,820
When you're licensing Mega Man, make it more like Mega Man 11,

2377
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:42,780
not fucking bad box Mega Man that was in, you know,

2378
01:57:43,660 --> 01:57:44,660
the fighting games.

2379
01:57:44,660 --> 01:57:48,060
But I'm all about new She-Ra that dresses like a normal person.

2380
01:57:48,380 --> 01:57:50,540
All about that. New She-Ra? Yeah.

2381
01:57:50,740 --> 01:57:52,260
She wears real fucking armor.

2382
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:54,940
Yeah. An actual breastplate, shorts under her skirt.

2383
01:57:54,940 --> 01:57:59,540
Instead of like a titty plate, she dresses like somebody might actually wear something.

2384
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:04,020
So real armor about fucking time.

2385
01:58:04,220 --> 01:58:06,020
OK, moving on.

2386
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:08,380
Let's go to a different type of gaming story.

2387
01:58:08,380 --> 01:58:09,380
Darcy.

2388
01:58:10,860 --> 01:58:15,100
Well, I'm sure we've seen an increase of diagnoses with kids with

2389
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:20,860
attention problems and kids having trouble with their own anger management.

2390
01:58:22,340 --> 01:58:25,860
There is a game now, this game came out in November last year,

2391
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:29,140
but it's getting a lot more attention.

2392
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:30,620
It's called Mightier.

2393
01:58:31,100 --> 01:58:35,500
And for kids who have issues with anxiety or

2394
01:58:36,220 --> 01:58:41,860
anger problems, what they do is they have the strap that goes on on their forearm

2395
01:58:42,180 --> 01:58:45,580
that measures their heart rate and oxygen level.

2396
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:52,140
And so the game itself will change based on their heart rate and oxygen level,

2397
01:58:52,140 --> 01:58:55,140
as in anxiety or stress response.

2398
01:58:55,460 --> 01:58:59,900
So they actually get rewarded for forcing themselves to calm down,

2399
01:58:59,900 --> 01:59:02,540
to breathe, to do soothing techniques.

2400
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:08,300
So basically, the game is to teach them how to self-regulate their own moods.

2401
01:59:10,380 --> 01:59:15,420
And actually has been rather lauded by a good series of behavioral pediatricians.

2402
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:19,820
Although there are some people who have been pretty much against it,

2403
01:59:19,820 --> 01:59:24,780
because, you know, it's just more they think that more video games

2404
01:59:24,780 --> 01:59:26,300
are going to lead to more attention problems.

2405
01:59:26,300 --> 01:59:31,100
But a lot of kids have found the game because it teaches them this.

2406
01:59:31,140 --> 01:59:33,300
They are now doing these things in real life,

2407
01:59:33,820 --> 01:59:39,180
because now they know that it should be a situation that they should calm themselves in.

2408
01:59:39,180 --> 01:59:43,260
So I think it's actually a pretty good idea that they're now bringing video games into

2409
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:44,340
modern psychology.

2410
01:59:44,660 --> 01:59:45,660
I think it's really awesome.

2411
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:50,820
Yeah, that was my story.

2412
01:59:51,940 --> 01:59:56,620
Cool. What do you think maybe we can take from this for,

2413
01:59:56,980 --> 02:00:00,460
like, I guess, if you will, mainstream development of games?

2414
02:00:00,660 --> 02:00:04,700
Well, I think that the same techniques could be applied toward adults, for one thing.

2415
02:00:08,780 --> 02:00:09,980
I think that...

2416
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:13,900
Well, see, I don't know.

2417
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:16,340
It makes me think that if we had the Vitality sensor,

2418
02:00:16,860 --> 02:00:19,820
if that had come out, Nintendo would have done more things like that, too.

2419
02:00:19,820 --> 02:00:23,220
You know, it's kind of an old concept if you think about it.

2420
02:00:23,220 --> 02:00:29,420
But I think that if it helps, I think kids with all of these issues

2421
02:00:29,420 --> 02:00:31,740
become better members of society.

2422
02:00:31,740 --> 02:00:37,300
Who knows? It could also inspire, you know, more games to help with, you know, social issues

2423
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:41,020
or, you know, or even going back to the accessibility issues, you know,

2424
02:00:41,020 --> 02:00:45,540
thinking in terms of using these as tools and not just as entertainment.

2425
02:00:45,900 --> 02:00:49,140
Helping these kids to be the future creators.

2426
02:00:49,580 --> 02:00:50,220
Something like that.

2427
02:00:50,220 --> 02:00:50,940
Yeah, I like that.

2428
02:00:51,660 --> 02:00:56,020
In chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Captain Spike says, wow, this is an awesome idea.

2429
02:00:56,580 --> 02:00:59,340
Dungeon Buster in chat says, there's an article I found on the net

2430
02:00:59,340 --> 02:01:03,340
of an old, old game mag from the early 80s that interviewed a psychologist

2431
02:01:03,340 --> 02:01:08,620
who used wizardry to help patients like children get out of their shells and socialize.

2432
02:01:08,860 --> 02:01:14,140
Wizardry as in the Sir Tech game, not like, you know, like Harry Potter.

2433
02:01:14,140 --> 02:01:15,060
You're a wizard, Harry.

2434
02:01:15,060 --> 02:01:17,100
Not like that, like the actual game wizardry.

2435
02:01:17,100 --> 02:01:19,220
If you remember that from back in the day, that's pretty cool.

2436
02:01:19,980 --> 02:01:21,540
All right. Just a few more stories for you guys.

2437
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:24,180
Then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio.

2438
02:01:24,180 --> 02:01:25,700
All one word on Skype.

2439
02:01:25,700 --> 02:01:27,100
First, Loki.

2440
02:01:27,100 --> 02:01:29,780
All right. So there's a new Famicom game coming out.

2441
02:01:29,900 --> 02:01:31,860
It's not exactly new.

2442
02:01:31,860 --> 02:01:34,220
It's not not new, new, as you will.

2443
02:01:34,220 --> 02:01:39,220
But it's basically a Japanese port of the game Battle Kid.

2444
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:44,860
And for those not familiar with Battle Kid, Battle Kid is an insanely fucking hard game

2445
02:01:45,220 --> 02:01:47,700
that looks very much like I want to be the guy.

2446
02:01:47,940 --> 02:01:51,460
In fact, you know, the main character looks exactly like we want to be the guy.

2447
02:01:51,660 --> 02:01:54,140
But it plays more like Mega Man.

2448
02:01:54,700 --> 02:01:58,860
So, you know, they have released this.

2449
02:01:58,860 --> 02:02:03,020
Originally, it was on an NES cartridge in 2010, and now it's actually making its way

2450
02:02:03,020 --> 02:02:04,020
to the Famicom as well.

2451
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:07,060
So they've done a few things with the Japanese version.

2452
02:02:07,060 --> 02:02:09,900
So the, of course, translation.

2453
02:02:10,180 --> 02:02:15,940
They also switched to hit points instead of one hit deaths, which I find interesting

2454
02:02:15,940 --> 02:02:17,740
because that's the whole point of the game.

2455
02:02:17,740 --> 02:02:21,100
It's supposed to be fucking hard and one hit deaths, but whatever.

2456
02:02:21,700 --> 02:02:28,140
They have a life counter, added some new checkpoints, added a new boss, new stage,

2457
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:34,060
new sound effects, 11 new music tracks, doubled the ROM size and changed the movement

2458
02:02:34,060 --> 02:02:35,660
attack patterns of some of the enemies.

2459
02:02:36,260 --> 02:02:37,420
So pretty cool.

2460
02:02:37,980 --> 02:02:40,340
And that's going to be that actually came out.

2461
02:02:41,660 --> 02:02:44,780
Yeah, it's supposed to be released in Japan September of this year.

2462
02:02:44,980 --> 02:02:46,980
Nice. All right.

2463
02:02:46,980 --> 02:02:49,660
Well, one more story for you guys out of Comic-Con and then we're going to get to our

2464
02:02:49,660 --> 02:02:51,700
Skypline at Orange Lounge Radio.

2465
02:02:51,700 --> 02:02:56,900
But if you're a big fan of Overwatch and you're a big fan of Nerf, we're going to be

2466
02:02:56,900 --> 02:03:03,260
very happy because they are releasing official Overwatch Nerf blasters.

2467
02:03:03,900 --> 02:03:08,340
This particular first one that's coming out is modeled after Reaper's weapon in

2468
02:03:08,340 --> 02:03:11,260
Overwatch. So it's these little like hand shotgun things.

2469
02:03:11,540 --> 02:03:15,140
But yeah, now you can get a Nerf version of this.

2470
02:03:15,140 --> 02:03:18,140
Nerf is partnering with Blizzard on the official Overwatch Nerf gun.

2471
02:03:18,380 --> 02:03:21,900
The Nerf Rival Overwatch Reaper White Edition.

2472
02:03:22,300 --> 02:03:24,100
It's due in 2019.

2473
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:26,180
It mimics the look of the shotgun.

2474
02:03:26,380 --> 02:03:29,100
But obviously the functionality is a little bit different.

2475
02:03:30,140 --> 02:03:34,500
You get eight little Nerf rounds for this and there's a ready indicator and a safety

2476
02:03:34,500 --> 02:03:35,580
lock with this.

2477
02:03:36,820 --> 02:03:40,980
So, Dartusy in chat says, I don't play Overwatch, but that is really cool in my

2478
02:03:40,980 --> 02:03:45,660
opinion. Yeah, you don't have to play Overwatch to understand a Nerf gun.

2479
02:03:46,140 --> 02:03:47,820
So it's pretty cool.

2480
02:03:47,980 --> 02:03:50,780
So no pricing has been announced yet.

2481
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:54,700
I'm sure it's probably not going to be very cheap, but it probably won't be too crazy

2482
02:03:54,700 --> 02:03:57,180
either. So who knows what will come after this?

2483
02:03:57,180 --> 02:04:01,740
Will they do weapons based off, you know, Soldier 76's weapon or Tracer's guns or

2484
02:04:01,740 --> 02:04:03,540
what? We'll see what happens.

2485
02:04:03,780 --> 02:04:08,500
So anyway, we'll see what comes of this Hasbro partnership a little later on.

2486
02:04:10,100 --> 02:04:14,140
All right. Anyhow, with that, we are going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge

2487
02:04:14,140 --> 02:04:15,860
Radio, all one word on Skype.

2488
02:04:15,860 --> 02:04:19,020
If you want to give us a call to talk about anything that we've talked about tonight or

2489
02:04:19,020 --> 02:04:22,820
maybe something that we missed, we're happy to take your call right now.

2490
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:27,300
While we wait to see if anybody calls in, Loki, any other stories that we didn't get to

2491
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:28,580
tonight? Some last minute stories?

2492
02:04:31,420 --> 02:04:35,180
I feel like it was I mean, even though we had Comic-Con this weekend, which is a big

2493
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:40,980
deal, it's not obviously there is stuff during the week that like I saw and I'm like, I

2494
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:44,500
know I'm going to forget that come Sunday and I didn't write it down.

2495
02:04:44,540 --> 02:04:47,860
And I know there's other things that happened that were like pretty significant.

2496
02:04:47,900 --> 02:04:51,860
And I'm just like I even went back to them, like looking for that stuff.

2497
02:04:51,860 --> 02:04:55,100
And I know one of them was that whole the AI thing, which we talked about.

2498
02:04:55,900 --> 02:04:58,180
But there is another thing, too, and I can't remember.

2499
02:04:59,620 --> 02:05:04,860
What it was. Oh, well, I guess it's not a huge thing that there was the two countries.

2500
02:05:04,900 --> 02:05:09,900
I can't remember which countries that European countries now that had issue with the

2501
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:19,100
loot boxes in Counter-Strike go that they actually removed loot boxes out of those

2502
02:05:19,100 --> 02:05:25,300
regions because of the whole laws regarding it, because they're going to face a bunch

2503
02:05:25,300 --> 02:05:29,180
of fines in regards to the loot boxes being gambling.

2504
02:05:29,180 --> 02:05:33,900
So I know that that was a thing, but that's kind of minor.

2505
02:05:34,260 --> 02:05:37,700
But it is interesting to see that they're having to take action for that stuff already.

2506
02:05:38,140 --> 02:05:42,580
Um, but yeah, a whole lot of news, a lot of Comic-Con stuff, lots of movies.

2507
02:05:42,620 --> 02:05:44,780
Yeah, a lot of that's movie movie talk, though.

2508
02:05:44,780 --> 02:05:48,980
Any well, let's let's allow ourselves to deviate a little bit here to some of the other

2509
02:05:48,980 --> 02:05:51,100
nerd stuff. Any of the nerd stuff out of Comic-Con?

2510
02:05:51,100 --> 02:05:55,500
Catch your eye. I'm surprised that the Aquaman trailer looked pretty good.

2511
02:05:55,500 --> 02:05:59,580
I don't really like DC stuff too much anymore, but the Aquaman trailer looked awesome.

2512
02:05:59,580 --> 02:06:01,740
And then, of course, Godzilla, King of the Monster.

2513
02:06:02,460 --> 02:06:06,380
That's awesome. It looks so well with a kid from Stranger Things in it, huh?

2514
02:06:06,380 --> 02:06:08,740
Yeah, but it just looks so good.

2515
02:06:08,740 --> 02:06:11,620
And then Glass looks interesting.

2516
02:06:11,660 --> 02:06:12,620
I want to see that.

2517
02:06:14,900 --> 02:06:16,700
I can't think of what else I saw.

2518
02:06:17,380 --> 02:06:21,220
I am excited, of course, to see the new Invader Zim movie whenever that comes out.

2519
02:06:21,940 --> 02:06:24,380
It looks very much Invader Zim.

2520
02:06:25,420 --> 02:06:31,580
Just sad that that's all there is, is just the movie, not rebooting a new show or anything.

2521
02:06:31,580 --> 02:06:33,020
Yeah, but whatever.

2522
02:06:33,020 --> 02:06:37,060
Um. Yeah, I don't know.

2523
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:38,740
I mean, that's pretty much it.

2524
02:06:38,740 --> 02:06:41,380
Oh, yeah, they have the Voltron Lego set coming out.

2525
02:06:41,420 --> 02:06:42,980
They were selling it at Comic-Con.

2526
02:06:42,980 --> 02:06:45,140
Yeah, that's coming out on August 1st.

2527
02:06:45,140 --> 02:06:48,340
I still need to put together my Tron light bike that I finally bought at the Lego store.

2528
02:06:48,340 --> 02:06:49,140
Yeah, I really need to.

2529
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:51,180
Very, very, very quick build.

2530
02:06:51,220 --> 02:06:52,340
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

2531
02:06:52,340 --> 02:06:54,220
I'm sure. But cool.

2532
02:06:54,540 --> 02:06:56,220
We still haven't put together our DeLorean.

2533
02:06:57,140 --> 02:06:58,940
Oh, would you get like an official two of them?

2534
02:06:58,980 --> 02:06:59,580
Oh, cool.

2535
02:06:59,580 --> 02:07:02,500
Oh, God, that thing's like that's pretty old now.

2536
02:07:02,540 --> 02:07:06,900
I know we have a couple of them just because Dan wanted one to build and one to keep in the box.

2537
02:07:06,900 --> 02:07:08,780
So I like that.

2538
02:07:10,420 --> 02:07:17,180
God, whenever I think of Lego, I think like Toys R Us and how, you know, they all went under because a lot of people were trying to get the deals and the Legos and stuff.

2539
02:07:17,180 --> 02:07:23,020
But like, we haven't seen what's going to go in at any of those old retail places on like a lot of these stores.

2540
02:07:23,020 --> 02:07:28,300
Halloween costume shop whenever, you know, spirit is where I buy all my house decorations.

2541
02:07:29,220 --> 02:07:30,940
But it's like they're everywhere.

2542
02:07:30,940 --> 02:07:34,100
And so it's like, oh, boy, last thing we need is another one of those.

2543
02:07:34,100 --> 02:07:35,900
I don't know. But that's fine.

2544
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:37,820
Yeah, I don't know what they would put in there.

2545
02:07:37,820 --> 02:07:40,220
I mean, I don't know.

2546
02:07:40,220 --> 02:07:42,260
I'm waiting to hear about KB coming back.

2547
02:07:42,740 --> 02:07:44,940
We need some Sears closed down.

2548
02:07:45,100 --> 02:07:46,300
There are local Sears.

2549
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:47,820
Oh, the one at Sunrise.

2550
02:07:47,820 --> 02:07:50,540
That's gone. Oh, that's completely gone.

2551
02:07:50,540 --> 02:07:51,860
I mean, I get it.

2552
02:07:51,860 --> 02:07:55,220
It's not like I'm crying, but like I'm like, what's left of that mall?

2553
02:07:55,220 --> 02:07:56,740
It's pretty empty.

2554
02:07:57,220 --> 02:07:58,860
They have a toy store.

2555
02:07:58,860 --> 02:08:03,580
It's like a mostly a board game store, but they have toys there.

2556
02:08:03,580 --> 02:08:05,260
It's just kind of lame.

2557
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:15,060
I think that you finally you find like stuff now at places like BoxLunch or the box lunch that we used to have up here close to the one in our fairs there.

2558
02:08:15,420 --> 02:08:17,660
The one up in there was one in Pladio, I think.

2559
02:08:17,700 --> 02:08:20,180
Oh, wow. The Arden Fair ones like nice and big.

2560
02:08:20,260 --> 02:08:21,700
We got a call coming in. So let's get to it.

2561
02:08:21,700 --> 02:08:23,100
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry. Who's this?

2562
02:08:23,660 --> 02:08:24,820
What's going on? It's Rama.

2563
02:08:25,020 --> 02:08:26,180
Hey, Rama, what's up, buddy?

2564
02:08:27,180 --> 02:08:29,820
Do I sound a lot better than the last time I called in?

2565
02:08:29,820 --> 02:08:30,860
You do sound a lot better.

2566
02:08:30,860 --> 02:08:33,060
Your volume is stabilizing a little bit, but that's normal.

2567
02:08:33,060 --> 02:08:33,780
What's on your mind, buddy?

2568
02:08:34,700 --> 02:08:36,700
Well, a couple of things I want to mention.

2569
02:08:36,700 --> 02:08:39,620
And on a side note, I got on an Amazon deal thing.

2570
02:08:39,620 --> 02:08:41,380
I got a brand new mic for like 60 bucks.

2571
02:08:41,380 --> 02:08:42,340
I'm kind of happy about that.

2572
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:43,860
Shoot. There you go. Good news.

2573
02:08:43,860 --> 02:08:46,180
Good news. What's up, my friend?

2574
02:08:47,420 --> 02:08:53,300
We were talking earlier about antenna TV and VTV, and I'm kind of thankful because I can get them on my...

2575
02:08:53,300 --> 02:08:57,460
Hey, buddy, you suddenly like your volume drops significantly.

2576
02:08:57,460 --> 02:09:00,660
I don't know if you moved away from your mic or something, but like we can't hear your question.

2577
02:09:01,540 --> 02:09:02,500
Can you hear me now?

2578
02:09:02,500 --> 02:09:03,420
Yes, we can, sir.

2579
02:09:03,900 --> 02:09:06,780
All right. This microphone is extra sensitive from what I can tell.

2580
02:09:06,780 --> 02:09:07,380
Interesting.

2581
02:09:08,540 --> 02:09:18,580
But what I was saying was antenna TV, VTV, it's not just available over the air, but depending on your local cable provider, you can catch them that way, too.

2582
02:09:18,740 --> 02:09:19,900
Yes, some of them.

2583
02:09:19,900 --> 02:09:23,700
Some of the channels are so cheap that cable doesn't even bother to pick them up.

2584
02:09:23,980 --> 02:09:26,700
But you're right. Some of those channels are on your local cable.

2585
02:09:26,700 --> 02:09:35,300
But, you know, with more and more people that are cord cutting these days, it is still pretty impressive what you can pick up with an antenna.

2586
02:09:35,620 --> 02:09:47,140
If you're willing to watch old stuff, you know, some people aren't interested in watching, you know, old reruns of Mama's Family, which to those people, I say, boo, because, you know.

2587
02:09:47,380 --> 02:10:01,140
But anyway, but, you know, there's a lot of stuff that you can pick up with an antenna these days, especially, but in a place like New York City or something, it's probably even doubly so than, you know, a more remote part of the country.

2588
02:10:01,140 --> 02:10:06,780
I wouldn't call Sacramento remote, but, you know, we probably still don't have as many channels over the air as you guys have.

2589
02:10:07,540 --> 02:10:14,580
Well, I mean, being here in New York City, I can pick up stations like in Southern Connecticut, per se.

2590
02:10:14,580 --> 02:10:16,020
So that's not so bad.

2591
02:10:16,020 --> 02:10:33,500
Right now, if you're in North Jersey, you're going to get the regular New York City stations down by where Makochon lives and where Ari lives, if they went to OTA antenna, actually more where Ari lives, he could pick up the local Philly affiliated stations.

2592
02:10:33,540 --> 02:10:43,180
Oh, wow. I remember as a kid when we used to like, if you could aim the antenna like just the right way, you could get Fox out of the Bay Area.

2593
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:49,900
Yes. Yes. Yes. Because I remember for a short period of time, this defined all logic.

2594
02:10:49,900 --> 02:11:01,940
I was able to pull a station in from like New Hampshire and I'm like, it's got to be bouncing off of a local affiliate or something like that because it was staticky and I could see the call symbols and stuff like that.

2595
02:11:02,100 --> 02:11:12,300
But, you know, kids, kids today will never understand having to sift through the static to see these or or even better yet when you're trying to watch Cinemax when you didn't pay for it.

2596
02:11:12,300 --> 02:11:20,260
And it's like, I think I saw a boob in like a wavy green type of filter.

2597
02:11:21,180 --> 02:11:30,580
I remember when we first got cable in our town and there was there was a remote, but it was a wired box and it wasn't numbers.

2598
02:11:30,580 --> 02:11:34,100
It was number so you got the 13 and then it was letters.

2599
02:11:34,100 --> 02:11:35,620
So you're telling the dial.

2600
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:39,220
I just remember it being at my cousin's house at Nickelodeon was Channel K.

2601
02:11:39,300 --> 02:11:41,180
That was the main thing that I really cared about.

2602
02:11:41,180 --> 02:11:55,980
I remember I remember that I was I remember that and I remember I remember in the mid 80s like we had a cable thing here was it was like Jones cable or something or it was in Roseville where I grew up before like Comcast bought them all out.

2603
02:11:56,260 --> 02:12:07,020
They had like a thing on they had a service like in the mid 80s where you could like download games to your TV and play these games on your like remote.

2604
02:12:07,700 --> 02:12:13,620
And this was like way before this became commonplace in like the day and age of apps.

2605
02:12:13,860 --> 02:12:16,980
So like, I don't know why that didn't really catch on more.

2606
02:12:16,980 --> 02:12:19,820
But like, I remember thinking that was, you know, it's way ahead of its time.

2607
02:12:23,380 --> 02:12:25,260
Yeah, crazy stuff anyway.

2608
02:12:25,740 --> 02:12:26,260
All right.

2609
02:12:26,820 --> 02:12:29,860
Well, my friend, is there anything else you want to share with us or?

2610
02:12:30,540 --> 02:12:31,220
One thing.

2611
02:12:31,420 --> 02:12:31,820
Yeah.

2612
02:12:31,820 --> 02:12:35,540
If Uchon does Maria, you have to do Prince Peach.

2613
02:12:36,540 --> 02:12:37,580
I'm open to that.

2614
02:12:37,580 --> 02:12:38,260
That'll be fun.

2615
02:12:38,700 --> 02:12:42,740
You have to throw the fish out and just dye it a nice peach pinkish color.

2616
02:12:42,820 --> 02:12:43,900
You will look so boss.

2617
02:12:44,060 --> 02:12:47,500
Well, maybe maybe I want to be Prince Rose-lin.

2618
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:50,340
I don't I don't know how to boyify that name, but who cares?

2619
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:52,900
Oh, Ross-lin.

2620
02:12:54,060 --> 02:12:56,020
You could just be like Prince Ross.

2621
02:12:56,060 --> 02:12:57,300
Yeah, yeah, Prince Ross.

2622
02:12:57,460 --> 02:13:03,380
Or maybe I want to be instead of Daisy, I would be Daniel, I guess.

2623
02:13:03,420 --> 02:13:04,020
Daffodil.

2624
02:13:06,220 --> 02:13:10,580
I think that you've got to get Allen in on this and you got to go to Uchon.

2625
02:13:10,700 --> 02:13:13,940
The fangirls would lose their shit, especially if they see the wedding rings.

2626
02:13:13,980 --> 02:13:18,500
OK, I kind of love the idea of Allen and I both doing it.

2627
02:13:18,500 --> 02:13:20,980
And one of us is Peach and the other one is Daisy.

2628
02:13:21,420 --> 02:13:21,920
Yes.

2629
02:13:22,340 --> 02:13:23,700
That that might have to happen.

2630
02:13:25,740 --> 02:13:28,580
If it does, I may have to fly out for that convention.

2631
02:13:28,580 --> 02:13:29,420
Seriously.

2632
02:13:29,420 --> 02:13:31,380
Yeah, I think it might be.

2633
02:13:31,380 --> 02:13:33,420
Well, you have Prince Peach and Duke Daisy.

2634
02:13:33,420 --> 02:13:35,700
It might be better if either way around.

2635
02:13:35,700 --> 02:13:39,180
I know it might be better if I'm Daisy, though, because like J.D. says in chat.

2636
02:13:39,380 --> 02:13:40,700
Hi, I'm Daisy.

2637
02:13:42,300 --> 02:13:43,820
I have to go around the con.

2638
02:13:44,060 --> 02:13:45,300
Hi, I'm Daisy.

2639
02:13:47,260 --> 02:13:48,780
And I don't think Allen would want to do that.

2640
02:13:49,180 --> 02:13:49,700
All right.

2641
02:13:50,380 --> 02:13:53,860
Anyway, but I think Allen would be more than happy to say Peach is the winner.

2642
02:13:54,180 --> 02:13:56,700
All right. Anyway, I'm going to let you go, my friend.

2643
02:13:56,700 --> 02:13:57,900
But thank you so much for the call.

2644
02:13:58,420 --> 02:13:59,620
No problem. I'll take care.

2645
02:13:59,660 --> 02:14:00,980
Bye, I'm Daisy.

2646
02:14:03,860 --> 02:14:05,180
Oh, my God, I'm dying.

2647
02:14:06,060 --> 02:14:09,660
J.D. in chat says, swear to God, Super Smash Ultimate had better have.

2648
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:11,580
Hi, I'm Daisy. Be a taunt.

2649
02:14:11,580 --> 02:14:13,500
Oh, if it's not, return it.

2650
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:14,860
Throw it in the trash.

2651
02:14:14,860 --> 02:14:18,060
If it's not an actual time in the game, it better, it better.

2652
02:14:18,620 --> 02:14:19,660
All right.

2653
02:14:19,660 --> 02:14:21,220
We're going to go ahead and close up Skype for now.

2654
02:14:21,220 --> 02:14:23,540
If you didn't get through, you want to say something to us.

2655
02:14:23,540 --> 02:14:24,380
You can always email us.

2656
02:14:24,380 --> 02:14:26,980
Participate at orange lounge radio dot com.

2657
02:14:26,980 --> 02:14:29,220
I bet they're going to have the rapids in there.

2658
02:14:29,220 --> 02:14:32,700
They might. I that would because then they could do like as a character,

2659
02:14:32,900 --> 02:14:34,340
you know, costumes.

2660
02:14:34,340 --> 02:14:38,820
Yeah, they have all the weird like rabbits that they have in the Mario Kingdom battle,

2661
02:14:38,980 --> 02:14:42,940
which is another game that my son has played that I still haven't played yet

2662
02:14:42,940 --> 02:14:44,700
because the Mario Kingdom. Yeah, we have.

2663
02:14:44,700 --> 02:14:46,380
Well, we just haven't played it. All right.

2664
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:48,100
I haven't played it. He's played it.

2665
02:14:48,100 --> 02:14:51,020
Well, we're going to wrap up another episode of Orange Lounge Radio with that.

2666
02:14:51,020 --> 02:14:54,180
Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show and supporting us.

2667
02:14:54,180 --> 02:14:57,500
If you like what you heard here at Orange, Andrea, tell a friend or two about the show,

2668
02:14:57,500 --> 02:14:59,580
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2669
02:14:59,580 --> 02:15:02,420
But if the voices aren't here to put out on the air,

2670
02:15:03,340 --> 02:15:04,300
how can we hear them?

2671
02:15:04,300 --> 02:15:05,900
So, yeah, tell a friend.

2672
02:15:05,900 --> 02:15:09,740
Leave a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Google Play podcast

2673
02:15:09,740 --> 02:15:11,660
or wherever it is you found this show.

2674
02:15:11,660 --> 02:15:14,140
Those go a really long way. Let me tell you.

2675
02:15:14,140 --> 02:15:17,460
And I know I say that every week, but it seems like nobody ever does it.

2676
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:21,180
So please, you know, if you have five seconds to help us out,

2677
02:15:21,420 --> 02:15:23,860
I really, really, really appreciate it.

2678
02:15:23,860 --> 02:15:25,820
So that's going to do it.

2679
02:15:25,820 --> 02:15:27,740
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2680
02:15:27,740 --> 02:15:28,860
Dark Sakura, I'll start with you.

2681
02:15:29,860 --> 02:15:31,380
Wasps suck.

2682
02:15:31,380 --> 02:15:36,220
I got stung in the chin by the same two wasps and had allergic reactions, of course.

2683
02:15:36,220 --> 02:15:39,100
And that was a week and a half ago.

2684
02:15:39,100 --> 02:15:40,900
And it looks like it's finally starting to heal.

2685
02:15:40,900 --> 02:15:43,340
But now it's peeling and it hurts.

2686
02:15:43,340 --> 02:15:46,660
Wasps are assholes.

2687
02:15:46,660 --> 02:15:48,660
And vote.

2688
02:15:48,660 --> 02:15:52,940
My final thought is I had a really good time going out randomly last night,

2689
02:15:52,940 --> 02:15:57,100
but I have to remind myself that I still can get hangovers.

2690
02:15:57,140 --> 02:16:00,180
And thank God mine went away before the show tonight.

2691
02:16:00,180 --> 02:16:01,740
Loki, your final thought tonight?

2692
02:16:01,740 --> 02:16:07,180
Uh, wasps like making nests at our house and I like spraying them with poison.

2693
02:16:08,060 --> 02:16:09,860
So there's that.

2694
02:16:09,860 --> 02:16:12,180
Hooray for poison.

2695
02:16:12,980 --> 02:16:14,140
All right. That's it.

2696
02:16:14,140 --> 02:16:15,500
That's going to do it for another episode.

2697
02:16:15,500 --> 02:16:18,140
We'll see you in seven days to do it all again.

2698
02:16:18,140 --> 02:16:20,820
