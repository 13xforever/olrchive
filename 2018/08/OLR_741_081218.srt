Tonight, QuakeCon winds down, but not without having unleashed information and a truly appetite wedding trailer for Doom Eternal.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is just one story and a week's worth of gaming news.

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Live tonight, episode number 741 for this, August the 12th of 2018.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I am Rob Roberts or MrRobRoberts on Twitter and joining me is TechmasterLoki.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How are you, Loki?

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm good. I'm full of breadsticks.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And I heard you were mentioning before the show you actually got to play some games.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I did play games this week.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Good. We'll get into that in our gaming weeks in a little bit.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And I mentioned to you off air, I went to the movies finally.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Because you know I never get out to the movies. Never ever.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But I was finally able to go see Mamma Mia 2.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And I had to drive all the way to San Jose to find somebody to see it with me.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So there you go. I got to see Mamma Mia.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And yes, Cher steals the entire movie.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I know you were dying to know, Loki, but there it is.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's my review.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So that's what's going on?

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes. Yes.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Alright, anyway.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You might notice at the beginning of the show I did not introduce Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Because she's been introduced enough times and we just said forget it.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Stop it.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So here's what's up.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
She's actually going to be out of the show for a little while.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Everything is fine. Everything is totally fine.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's a work conflict, actually.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So that part really sucks.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But obviously we have to do what we have to do to pay the bills and to live our personal lives.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So as you guys, I mean she's alluded to this a couple times on the show.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
She has some changes going on at work and she's kind of doing some new things.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Well they did a little schedule thing and she's going to have to work Sundays.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So that sucks.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And the part that really sucks is that as far as I know, we're stuck that way until February.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So it's going to be a few months.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's going to be Halo Classic Game of the Week.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You think? No. Here's the thing though.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thanks to Radio Magic. We've been here before, believe it or not.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Even though people may be like, oh you know.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And it does suck. I'm not going to belittle that point.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But I have to move forward.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The show must go on as they say.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So you might remember this happened a couple years ago.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Something similar happened.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And so we used Radio Magic to get her here every week to do the Classic Game of the Week.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We'll do the same tonight and we'll continue to do that and continue to get her insight.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And if you still want to email her questions and things like that, you can.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Also, I'm told she is going to try to make it one show a month at the end of the month every month.

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Because this whole conflict is affecting her charity stuff she does with Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Which she's talked about on the show. She's very big on them.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The problem is, they also meet on Sundays.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So this whole thing with Sundays is a really bad personal thing for her.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And again, you gotta do what you gotta do for work sometimes.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So I think she said she's going to try to do one show a month where she can go do her meeting and then come here.

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So it's not like she's gone, gone, gone.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But it is just going to be for a little while.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Loki and I holding down the fort in studio.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Although I do hope to invite some of our familiar faces back.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And some new ones too over the coming weeks.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Not that Dark Sakura's presence can possibly be filled.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But we will do what we can to at least diversify the opinions here in studio.

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Beyond just Loki and myself.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
One way of course that we always diversify the opinions every week is you guys in our chat room.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Where you guys join us live on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Again our chat at live.vognetwork.com.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
SSJ100Matt says, damn hope Jamie can phone in every once in a while.

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Well certainly I will definitely take her calls as a priority.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I think she's working during the show so she can't even listen sadly.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But remember thanks to Radio Magic we can still have Jamie here for a little bit on the show every week.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
SSJ100Matt is also asking in chat. Kind of changing things a little bit here.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
San Jose is near MagWest was this weekend. Were you able to stop by Rob?

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Sadly my answer is no.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And the double part about that that's kind of sad is because as I mentioned I was in San Jose yesterday.

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I went out there to visit my friends had a baby a couple months ago.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And not to get too into personal details but the mom had some like medical issues after.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Everybody's fine everything's fine but she couldn't have visitors for a couple months.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So I finally got to go out there to see the baby.

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And so I that was kind of the priority over and then we went to the movie together.

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's who I would see the movie with and you know it was a little bit kind of time between us.

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And that was kind of the priority.

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I did consider going by MagWest after but the reality is it takes me two hours to drive to San Jose.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So driven over that morning and then it was like I was already on my watch going it's gonna be nine o'clock before I get back.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And that's assuming I don't go to MagWest at all.

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And I was getting text updates from friends that were there that were like oh they have keyboard mania.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You know I haven't played one of those machines forever.

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But long story short I just didn't get over there due to personal stuff.

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And I kind of had a headache coming on towards the end of the day anyway.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So I was just like you know what I need to just drive home and make sure I can feed Mr. Smoosh.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Because Alan's been out all weekend actually Alan went camping this weekend.

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So yeah it's been like a crazy weekend all over the board.

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But sadly no I wasn't able to get to MagWest and that's now two years in a row.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm hoping next year I'll have better luck.

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Hopefully well next year part of also why this happened when it did is that I actually probably could have done this trip sooner.

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But I had Clue and all those rehearsals that were taken like six weeks up to that.

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So I couldn't get out there like before now.

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So that also got in the way.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So that probably I mean I say it got in the way but I love doing that show and that experience.

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But that will all not be a factor next year.

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So I'm really really hoping there'll be a third year.

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Hopefully me not attending does not get the whole con cancelled.

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I would love to go too.

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'd love to go next year so that'll be good.

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah S.G.O. 100 Matt in chat says understood Rob you got to see the baby.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yes I do. Yes I do.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And it was it was totally worth it.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Y.Y.R. in chat is asking about Jamie's absence here.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Last time Jamie was out for an extended period she knew in advance was this kind of dropped on her.

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Difficult for me to answer.

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I would have to defer to her.

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I think she knew there was a schedule change in the works.

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But she had a pretty good feeling she'd be able to get Sundays off.

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And I think the fact that she couldn't did kind of surprise her.

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That is my sort of perception based on what I've heard of what happened there.

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But I do know for what she does at her J job again I'm not going to get into all her business that's her stuff to explain.

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But for what she does her J job actually this change is a really good thing as to like what she's doing now.

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So it's just a bummer that the side effect is.

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But it's going to kind of put her back on the seniority so she's not or she's having to work Sundays which that part kind of sucks.

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So anyway S.S.J. 100 Matt talking about Magfest the main music and games festival back east.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Magfest is going to be a free for all mess again.

129
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You know the jury's out on if I want to try for Magfest this year which sucks because I really need to kind of figure that out fast.

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Because I know the tickets in the hotels especially are going to be crazy pretty soon here.

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But jury's still out on the Magfest Prime just because between Dragon Con coming up in a few weeks.

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I can't believe Dragon Con is only like three weeks away.

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And then I'm doing Final Fantasy Fan Fest again.

134
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't know if I have the time off available.

135
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Speaking of day jobs I don't know if I have the time off available to do Magfest.

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But if it all works out I would love to do it.

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's for sure for sure.

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Anyway let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We're talking about a lot of personal stuff but let's get into some gaming discussion.

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So this is an interesting this isn't about this time like why why now.

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This is like a business element.

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah this is a weird timing thing.

143
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
All right Logan just get into it.

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This whole thing is kind of weird.

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So there was a guy by the name of Ryan Hupp who was selling a copy of The Evil Within 2 on Amazon.

146
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Now it was a new copy because he hadn't unsealed it yet.

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Basically he had purchased a copy for the PlayStation 4 but ended up instead of using money to buy a PlayStation 4 he spent it on upgrading his PC so he didn't need a PlayStation 4 copy of the game.

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So he went and sold it or trying to sell it on Amazon which people do.

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So Bethesda as a legal firm Boris had sent a letter to him threatening legal action for noncompliance basically saying that he is an unauthorized seller and it was unlawful for him to be selling that game.

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And you know to which you know of course there's the first sale doctrine which allows you to do that.

151
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This law firm apparently though is they like to take action against the first sale doctrine because they even have like a page on their site talking about how they get around that which it doesn't make any sense.

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Their reasoning for it was well it wasn't protected by the first sale doctrine because basically it wasn't in its original form which would include a warranty.

153
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Which my thought is where the fuck are these games coming with warranties from because I know if I purchase a game from GameStop or something like that that's sealed.

154
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
How's that any different than purchase it from somebody else that's sealed. Where's my warranty difference. Is it that I can take it back to GameStop if it doesn't work.

155
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I mean I think so actually like I think it's all in fine print but I think like in the in the back of boxes or something it doesn't talk about like a manufacturer warranty sometimes I mean it's one of those things.

156
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Granted I hardly ever pay attention to question I don't know if they're necessarily going to question you know where you know you purchase it from maybe they would need a receipt or something like that to do the warranty on it.

157
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Okay I see it. Hold on. So I actually I just happen to have in studio a copy of Rise of the Tomb Raider on Xbox One. Don't ask it was here in studio and sure enough if you take the discount you read the back limited warranty for your copy of Xbox game software in the United States and Canada.

158
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So it says it's covered by this warranty within the 90 day period blah blah blah free of charge according to the process identified below.

159
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Warranty claims should be made to your retailer. Return the and I can't read it because the little disk nub is in the way but some I'm assuming is return the game to your retailer along with a copy of the original sales receipt and an explanation of the difficulty you're experiencing with the game.

160
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The retailer will either repair or replace the game. Any replacement game will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or 30 days from receipt whichever is longer blah blah blah blah blah.

161
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So so I mean to be fair yes when you buy a game there is a warranty you probably don't. It's such fine print it's sitting there behind the desk who's reading they're full of shit then if that's the case because there still is a warranty through Amazon.

162
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Because if you get a game that's effective and you file a claim through Amazon and you say hey this game is effective then the seller has to give you the money back or you have to ship it off to them or whatever the case may be so you do have coverage there.

163
00:11:48,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But it's whatever the case would be normally what it's supposed to be is that as long as it's not basically the limitations on it is that it's completely changed from its original form like you know because they sell.

164
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So so and Bobby says some comments here in our chat at live dog network dot com that I sort of he kind of simplifies it here he could sell it pre-owned since he owned it.

165
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Your receipt is your warranty but the first warranty was between the seller and the original retail retailer.

166
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So in other words even if it was sealed even if you never opened it this person that ends up buying it doesn't end up buying it as new because they would not be able to.

167
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I mean if the disc is defective or something like that they are up shit creek they can't use the original receipt because there is no receipt in this type of transaction.

168
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Now I just want to state I don't necessarily agree with this whole thing I think that's why I kind of said this is whole right this is weird.

169
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And the reason why it's weird this is like a dude on eBay like what's what's the big fucking deal it's a dude on eBay like it does it does he sell five thousand of these games like to see how he's selling one.

170
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah see that's that's the thing like why like is Bethesda going to patrol garage sales across America like here here's here's why I'm kind of going like.

171
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I used to sell sealed games all the fucking time because we would get like promotional copies which were just actual retail games and I would get like maybe three or four copies of a game.

172
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What am I going to do with that. I could give them the friends that I had sometimes but I'd sell them turn the profit. Why not. Right. And I didn't ever well email from.

173
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Well you know there is a why not is that because part of the terms of the promotion is that you're really not supposed to be able to.

174
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But that was a long no it was a long time ago. It was promotional as in it was it was people working for these companies that had they get free copies or extra copies and they're like here I don't want this crap.

175
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You take this. Yeah I'm sure if we wanted to dig into the legalese of it though we can find a problem with it. But I it was a long time ago doesn't matter. Here's the thing though. OK. Yeah I went to and I remember this is a while ago I went to the denials auction out in Roseville.

176
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You know the big flea market thing. And so this was when they used to have the place across the street also auction town or whatever it's called. This is a while ago but long story short there was a video game booth there that's always there in this video game booth had all these games.

177
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And one of the things they sold that they had for sale was a shrink wrapped copy of clue on the Super Nintendo. And I was like fuck yeah clue on the Super Nintendo like you know I which is ironic because I know I just talked about the movie not that long ago but I guess I've just always kind of liked clue in general and the whole you know fun murder mystery stuff.

178
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:46,000
But I actually did kind of enjoy the Super Nintendo clue game which was also on the Genesis. Remember that needs to be a classic game of the week some week because it was it was very different from the board game. Anyway I wanted to get a copy of a clue on the Super Nintendo shrink wrap.

179
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I was like oh there was nothing that said it was new or anything like that. But I was like well that's kind of cool that it's still shrink wrapped. But I didn't think much of it. I was just like whatever you know in my mind I actually was kind of like new or not.

180
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Those Super Nintendo cartridges are fucking rocks. This game is still going to work right. So anyway I bought it brought it home opened it up. I ended up putting it in there and as I'm looking through the instruction manual the back of the manual already has stuff written in it.

181
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So my point is I bought a shrink wrap version of clue that was there to like be passed off as new and so forth. To be fair they didn't advertise this new. But it was you know it's certainly being re shrink wrapped made you think that or whatever.

182
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But it was a resealed used copy is what it was. Now in my opinion if Bethesda wants to pick a fight those types of you know retailers that are selling lots and lots of them should be where they're picking their file.

183
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:53,000
They can't though because people there are people that you can't I don't even know how they're able to pick the fight like that because there's distributors I used to work for a distributor.

184
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:12,000
We sell copies of games to other companies like a person that may work in you know have a shop in denial or whatever but they're brand new copies. So there is no like oh you have to sign a form to be a special reseller of this stuff.

185
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:25,000
There was nothing like that. So all of this is horseshit from their lawyers. It's all horseshit. Good luck taking that to the court and actually arguing that first sale doctrine thing. See how that works out for you.

186
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Now granted they're going to strong arm somebody because it's one copy. He's like fuck it. I don't care. It's just one fucking copy of a game. You know fine. I won't sell it as brand new sealed.

187
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Does Bethesda has something to gain from this because this sure looks it. But this has got to be all their legal company. They're contracted organization like these legal things. And here's what Bethesda said about it too. They're like you know unless you remove all Bethesda products from your store for it or was this.

188
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:05,000
No that wasn't. Oh here we go. But that does not and will not block the sale of pre-owned games. The issue in this case is that the seller offered a pre-owned game as new on the Amazon marketplace.

189
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:17,000
We do not allow off non authorized resellers to represent what they sell is new because we can't verify that the game hasn't been opened and repackage. Oh wait it was an eBay it was Amazon.

190
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yeah it was on Amazon. Oh I thought it was eBay this whole time. You can do the same thing though on eBay. I Amazon you can offer your items like you have. No I know I know the difference. I know there's the whole like there's plenty of shit on Amazon that instead of saying sold and shipped by Amazon dot com it says sold and shipped by you know Joe Schmo gaming company or something.

191
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:52,000
But that is that does throw an interesting monkey wrench in the whole thing. It doesn't it doesn't any I said again here's the thing again I don't agree with going after one dude or whatever but Amazon is a store front.

192
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The guy is I'm sorry. How should I describe my game. You know I have a copy here. It's brand new in the box and it's still on it and never and sealed.

193
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But and I open now I'm the price bought and never opened. I just told you how to describe it by never open. It's fucking stupid. But why over we wouldn't have got sued if he called it bought never open.

194
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:26,000
This is stupid. These. I mean why. Why are you wasting time. I don't disagree that it's stupid but at the same time like it's kind of like one of those like from a legal standpoint I get it.

195
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But is it worth it. No that is that is kind of like where my head's at right now. OK well let's just let him get away with it. Like they got away with charging for mods too. Let's never forget.

196
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Here's other fucking platform Loki. They're not getting away with it because we're not the only podcast sitting here this week. There's not the only gaming but I understand.

197
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Defending them and say well they were within the right. No fuck them. You know what. Fuck them. They're a big fucking company doesn't patch the fucking games. They can just they can fucking.

198
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What is OK. What is wrong. Loki was saying though legally I guess. Yeah maybe we should reevaluate that legal situation. Don't we do that a lot here.

199
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I know a lot in life in general. OK let's. Wow the laws are critically stupid. Here's hypothetically though let's let's just think about this. So say I am Joe Schmoe who owns a game shop.

200
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:33,000
OK right. And I purchased my copy of the game from a distributor who was purchased it from Bethesda. Right. So technically I could be the first the game shop would be the first owner of it if I would say.

201
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So really the game shops give me the first owner and none of them are brand new. You're an authorized retailer. Am I because you know like because you went through an authorized distributor.

202
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So you're an authorized retailer. I just explained though that the thingy in the Tomb Raider thing I read did not say needs to go back to GameStop. It said authorized retailer. It doesn't matter.

203
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It doesn't matter though. There's no difference between that copy purchase at GameStop purchase from any other game store ever get into law directly. In fact if you ever get called for jury duty you should just say I.

204
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm going to yell and scream because law is stupid because I'm not law is stupid sometimes Loki. I'm not saying it don't ever get into law.

205
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm just going to tell you first sale doctor protects this kind of crap because and many have tried to get around the first sale doctrine and I'm sorry it's it's not gonna happen.

206
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Disney loves to try to fight this shit and telling you what you can and cannot do with copies that you've purchased you know through retail.

207
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So this is yet another company trying to do that. I'm sorry first sale dropped in first sale doctrine bitch. It's always going to fuck your shit up.

208
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So you just got to get over your shit and fucking just make better games or something if that's the problem. If we titled our show I would title this one first sale doctrine bitch.

209
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I mean like seriously it's stupid. It's absolutely stupid.

210
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:07,000
S.S.G. 100 Matt in chat says over at live dot vog network dot com. I guess I kind of see it like buying selling a car. Someone can't just buy a car from a dealership drive down the street and sell it myself as new.

211
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,000
No in fact once you drive a car they always say once you drive the car off the lot it's already lost like 10 percent of its value.

212
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Well I drove it on test drives. Technically that's off the lot. So you always want to fight it. Eric gave me that 10 percent discount.

213
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You always want to fight the man Loki.

214
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:38,000
All right. Going to chat over at life not fog network dot com. Bobby agrees with me going through an authorized distributor you are an authorized retailer stores that you worked with Loki.

215
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:51,000
They were authorized retailers. GameStop is not an authorized distributor. Why we are in chat says Are you sure you can't try to sell it as new. It doesn't mean someone is going to fall for it.

216
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But when the pink slips get exchanged while I are that's when your devious plan is going to go Ari because the person giving it to you on the pink slip is no longer going to be the retailer.

217
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That's that's why the DMV tracks all that stuff is who owned the car previously and all that stuff. So honestly just sell it again like on eBay or something. No one's going to pay attention.

218
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:22,000
No there's no lawyers are going to fucking come after you for that shit. I did it all the fucking time. This all tie into why GameStop will not take your games back if they're sealed because I always thought that was more of an issue stolen game.

219
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Well yeah that's more of an issue with stolen games which that makes no fucking sense anyways because OK I'm taking the shrink wrap up. OK now I can take it back.

220
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Well technically you're going to hate me tonight. I don't care. Technically if the employee sees you do it the employee still has to say I'm sorry that came in here shrink wrapped. I can't take it because the employee saw you doing it.

221
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Now if you know that rule and you take the shrink wrap off as you're walking up to the store and throw it in nearby receptacle and the employee doesn't see you doing it then yeah you can sell it as back as pre-owned.

222
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And how dumb of a. Don't steal. Number one don't steal games. But number two I mean if you bought it if you really truly bought a game that you never fucking played and you've all done it.

223
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You've all you may not have done it with a physical game but open up this little application on your computer called steam. You've all fucking bought a game that you never played OK.

224
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So if you've ever done that a game a game at least one singular game. OK.

225
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I already know I'm not even going to turn around and look at the chat room because I know there's going to be somebody in there is going to be like well I load all of my games at least once.

226
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Anyway I'm just not even going to look fine. You're special. Have a cookie. But for the most part you're all out there. There's people that have bought games they've never fucking played.

227
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So if you've ever done it with a physical game and you try to go sell it back like you know you should be able to do that if you realized you made a mistake you have buyer's remorse.

228
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You should have the evil within two. I mean come on. We're not talking Skyrim. It's truly or even something that like people want again like no man's sky.

229
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Like it's not even a game where it's like suddenly you want this again. You know where it's it's riding a second wave.

230
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I'm just mad that someone doesn't want the evil within two and they're just like well it's dumb. It's dumb. It's stupid. They shouldn't get away with it.

231
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:20,000
All right. Going to chat one more comment here. MXC in chat says I'm pretty sure a store near me sells stolen games or something. They sell the games as disc only.

232
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah. Well I don't think that necessarily means it's stolen but that is strange. They could be weird flop things that like the manufacturing screwed up the box or something. I mean I don't know it's.

233
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Yeah they could be purchasing damaged stuff but yeah admittedly it's a stretch. But well remember when GameStop used to get so much shit because this wasn't that long ago.

234
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:48,000
This is what like four or five years ago when the last copy of the game in the store was just the disc. They would be like this our last copy it's new.

235
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I'm going to put you may have noticed that your copy of Until Dawn Rush of Blood was not sealed because that was the last copy.

236
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:12,000
They still do it. They still fucking do it. But they're an authorized reseller. What the fuck. What the fuck people. It's not sealed. How the fuck am I supposed to know that they're not an authorized reseller.

237
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Actually says that you fucking lied to me. Actually if they're still checking out game actually where the lawsuits for you know I'm going to I'm going to humor that argument because actually if they're still letting employees check out games and shit then Bethesda should be suing GameStop.

238
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:40,000
They should be because you know why. Because they're just too fucking lazy to make up case art. And well they're saving on costs that way because they don't want to print their own cases.

239
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Anyway. All right. Let's move on. I don't know. I don't know if there's anything else we could say on this. All right. One more S.T. 100 Matt in chat says Loki would be the person to buy the car at the dealership.

240
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Put an ad on Craigslist for the new car that they have to meet you at that dealership. The car can't depreciate in value if it doesn't drive off the lot.

241
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Loki. I can see the meme right now and holding him. Oh the guy with the tap. Can't lose value if you don't drive it off the line. There you go. All right. Anyway let's move on.

242
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:23,000
That's that's one of many news stories we get to cover tonight. No this is the problem with Jamie not being here is that there's no one to keep the peace. But at the same time what is Jamie ever been the one to keep the peace.

243
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I just feel like the balance is off. That's all. Loki and I are meant to fight for the next several months. All right. Anyway let's get into our gaming weeks. Let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

244
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Loki you've been playing some games. So I did play a couple of games. So I did actually get to play Horizon Zero Dawn finally. So that was pretty cool. And it looks gorgeous. And I played a few hours of that. I kind of dig it.

245
00:26:48,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I've already had the ending ruined for me sort of I kind of forgot a lot of that. So I'm just going to pretend that I don't know the twist but it is enjoyable. It's enjoyable game. I'm playing it on the easiest difficulty ever because I just don't want to give an effort to its story difficulty so you can focus on the story.

246
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It's still pretty difficult. So there's nothing wrong with playing a game on Ultra hard you know. And then Bobby Black Wolf flopped the game so you could have an easy mode. So use it. Exactly. All right. And then I loaded up the Java version of Minecraft because now having loaded on my son's laptop I realized that they have better controller support and stuff now.

247
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And it seems like it's a lot easier to do the mods and everything now. So I've been messing with that and I put the Pokemon mod on there and that's interesting walking around the game and having Pokemon everywhere that you can catch and stuff. Cute. It's neat.

248
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It'd be cool to do like a server like that. I don't know how to run that but it can be done. It's just can you run modded stuff with realms or not through realms realms is just through like the console.

249
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
We said like months ago we were into a VOD.

250
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:13,000
But like the console Minecraft is its own thing. So that's all the ones that are on everything. Not anymore. The piece is a PC connected to tablet connected to Nintendo. That's the Windows 10 version.

251
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:22,000
OK. So the Windows 10 version is connected to all of those cross platform things. I'm talking about the Java version. Oh sorry.

252
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Old Minecraft. You're right. You're right. Yeah. So yeah. Old Minecraft. You can do all that fun stuff with Forge and everything. So I was trying that out. I couldn't get any of the shaders to run which is weird because I have like a GTX 1060 in there.

253
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So whatever happened to 4K graphics in Minecraft. They still have that E3 2017. They tease that. And I know y'all are laughing. Ha ha. Minecraft in 4K.

254
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:57,000
But seriously check out the screenshots like it look gorgeous because sure it still has that old like you know retro look to it but like the water was really like the sunsets and the environment.

255
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Yeah. Look at like Sonic ether's unbelievable shaders or something like that. They can. It looks really nice and you can do like higher res textures and everything like that.

256
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Just yeah I wasn't able to get to work on my version of Minecraft I had. So I'm still trying to figure that out. But whatever. I mean it looks all right and runs good.

257
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And then I see what else they play. That's about it. I didn't really work a whole lot this week on on programming stuff. I mean I sort of did. I kind of was gathering information and everything.

258
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm trying to basically build what I had started building in unity for one of my game projects in unreal now. So I was kind of trying to see if there's better ways to do everything.

259
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:57,000
So that's what I was doing this week. And then I picked up a surface pro 3. So I've been doing that. That's going to be exclusively for art work and stuff so I can actually draw my own artwork easily.

260
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:14,000
So I'm looking forward to messing with that. All right. My gaming week pretty dull mostly because I was gone most of the weekend. So it's kind of a repetition of a lot of my old go tos Final Fantasy 14 was a big chunk of that because they got a minor update this week.

261
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But it added this new thing called Eureka pagos to it for those of you that play the game. So I've grinded enough of Eureka animals where I could go into the new one the pagos.

262
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:37,000
So I was checking that out a little bit but it's because it is so new like there's a lot of stuff people are still trying to figure out with it. So it's probably going to take a couple weeks before people because you know there's crazies out there that will grind max level as fast as they can.

263
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And then you know kind of help people figure things out. So it's still in kind of a discovery mode. So I've been playing more of the first Eureka to still try to level up to the absolute cap that you can get to.

264
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Because it's interesting Eureka is like a separate leveling system than the rest of the game. But Eureka is also meant to be a little bit more of a throwback to Final Fantasy 11.

265
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Because like it's all about getting parties together to chain XP mobs and get XP that way. And if you die you level down just like in Final Fantasy 11.

266
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:15,000
So unless you get resurrected which is actually a pretty easy thing to get. So but yeah if you if you're too lazy and you'll get resurrected you actually lose XP like you did in 11.

267
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But it doesn't affect the main game at all. It's all like a side thing that you do. That's where they put the new relics. So if you want to get your relic weapon it's all in there.

268
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So I've been playing a bit of that in Final Fantasy 14 and then continuing Heroes of the Storm. I've been playing two or three games of that like every day just to make sure I get my quest done.

269
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And you might be wondering like which character do I play? Which character do I like to play? I really kind of float around everybody because I'm always trying to finish my quests.

270
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:54,000
But lately I've really taken a liking to Hanzo which is weird because I can't stand him in Overwatch. But like in Heroes of the Storm I really love some of the builds he can do because he's so good at what they call wave clear.

271
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:03,000
So like you know how like in lane games there's like minions that will like you know crawl across the map. So like Hanzo has this thing where he can like insta kill minions if you build his thing a certain way.

272
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:13,000
So it feels like really rewarding to kind of like if you're the only one on a lane which sometimes happens to like just insta kill all the minions and then it's really easy to kind of push the towers that way.

273
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:23,000
So yeah I don't know like I really like playing Hanzo in that game. So yeah except he's so he's so weak. Like if somebody decides to target him they can shred him so fast.

274
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:31,000
So that's the thing with Hanzo. But he can run over walls. That's the other thing. So like if you get in a bad situation you just run over walls and try to get out of it.

275
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:39,000
So anyway. That's been pretty much my game a week otherwise. So no real announcements to tell you guys about.

276
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I already talked about Dragon Con stuff last week so I won't repeat myself except that we will not be here Labor Day weekend as I will be at Dragon Con in Atlanta.

277
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And if you're planning to be at Dragon Con I really do hope to see you there. I will have several panels where you can come say hello. I will publish a full schedule shortly.

278
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Actually it will be in the app which is expected to be updated around the 20th. So about 10 well actually yeah about 10 days for the Con 9 days for the Con.

279
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So the app will be fully updated and you can actually go and when you go into the guests attending professionals you can actually find Rob Roberts and you'll be able to see my whole schedule right there in the app.

280
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:20,000
The funny thing is and I did this last year which was my first year as an attending professional because you make your own schedule in the app.

281
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So the first thing I'll do is I'll look up myself and favorite all my own stuff to make sure that my schedule is there first.

282
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And then the other stuff that I want to see I add to it because it will tell me if there's any conflicts.

283
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Like last year there was something I wanted to see and I couldn't go because I had a panel at the same time. It's like whoop conflict.

284
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,000
That's the only bummer about Dragon Con. Too much going on that's sometimes scheduled at the same time.

285
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:54,000
So anyway yes Bobby I will favorite yours next. The sad thing is Bobby there's and you already know this there's stuff that we have at the exact same time.

286
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:02,000
In fact I believe the very first panel time slot Friday 10 a.m. well unless you count Thursdays because Thursday is the new Friday.

287
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:10,000
But pretty much Friday the very first time slot in the morning like Bobby and I have a conflict. We are next door to each other.

288
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:18,000
He's in like video games B and I'm in video games A. We have like panels and we are both moderating said panels.

289
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:28,000
So literally competing against each other. But I have the Mass Effect actors. He has cell phone game development if I remember the timing right.

290
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I think we know who's going to win that. Well here's the thing. Maybe in popularity yes. However like yes I'm yes I will win that contest in popularity.

291
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But that's not really about that because if I'm a developer sometimes it's not about like that it's about what are you going to get out of a panel.

292
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
If I'm a developer you're going to get more out of Bobby's panel than you will out of mine with the Mass Effect.

293
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
But if you're a fanboy you're going to get more out of mine. Well I would go to Bobby's panel anyways because I don't really care for Mass Effect.

294
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:04,000
See there you go. And that's totally fine. Both panels will be great. All right. Anyway. All right.

295
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:13,000
SSG100 Matt in chat says one of you should pull a Carson and storm the others panel. You know it is what is interesting is it is the first year that Bobby and I are kind of do it.

296
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So honestly I could go over there and say I'm Bobby Black Wolf and he could go over there and say he's Rob Roberts. I don't think anyone would ever know.

297
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:32,000
They would when they start asking development questions and I just feel that's a good question. What do you think. I wish I knew that.

298
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Well just have you tried turning up the graphics on level three.

299
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Every time your development on and then back or off. Have you tried turning it off and then on again.

300
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:56,000
No I'm not. I'm not going to do that to the poor developers out there that really want to learn something from the talented people behind Simpsons tapped out that cell phone game is is nuts.

301
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:04,000
There's I know people that play that game that would even consider themselves gamers but it's like dude you're obsessed with Simpsons tapped out like you're a gamer.

302
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So anyway moving on let's get into some news stories and stop talking about dueling panels Loki once you start us off with some news tonight.

303
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
OK so there's lots of different Diablo games in the works.

304
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:32,000
This is Blizzard. Apparently they put out a short video with the community manager Brandy Kamel and promised that there is going to be that they're not ignoring the Diablo fans that they have multiple projects in the works.

305
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Some of them are going to take longer than others but we may have some things to show you later this year.

306
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Yeah hit hit Blizzcon later this year get those pre-orders or do they sell tickets for that or there is I think a third wave coming a surprise third wave of tickets coming up shortly.

307
00:36:49,000 --> 00:37:01,000
But the main waves have all sold out and I would imagine this third wave is probably like rejected cards and possible spam bought things that have been caught for the first two waves being real.

308
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,000
So I would imagine this third wave is going to be very small. So well pre-order that pay-per-view.

309
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Yeah right. Yeah they have the good old pay-per-view I guess so.

310
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Yeah man I do wish I was going to Diablo this year or Blizzcon this year because Diablo is my favorite of all the franchises that Blizzard does.

311
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Apparently you're a gamer was saying that.

312
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Have you heard some of the rumors.

313
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Yeah they reported that Diablo 3 is coming to the switch.

314
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And that one's been out there for a while. I think that would be a good thing to drop at Blizzcon for the holidays is that Diablo 3 is coming out on switch.

315
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I mean but there's also that part of me that's like okay but like I've I've literally played through Diablo 3 like hundreds of times like there's there's only so much more I can give to that game.

316
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:56,000
If they're going to sweeten the pot by putting some new stuff in Diablo 3 like a proper expansion but I'm not going to hold my breath because I kind of think they're working on Diablo 4.

317
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I think we're far enough out now where we can start saying the number 4.

318
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:08,000
But the other rumor that's out there is that they are going to remaster Diablo 2 just like they did with Starcraft not that long ago.

319
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Maybe.

320
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Because you know people still love Starcraft and there's still people that swear by Diablo 2 as the Diablo which I totally get because there was a lot that changed between Diablo 2 and 3 especially when it comes to like classes and just the way the game played.

321
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:32,000
So there's people that are still loyal to Diablo 2 so to remake Diablo 2 with just HD graphics I think there'd be a huge interest for that.

322
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
So I wouldn't be surprised at all for that to be a big reveal as well.

323
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So those might be like they're sooner than others they're going to announce you know Diablo 3 on Switch and Diablo 2 remaster.

324
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And maybe you know again I'm fan wanking get the tarp because I'm fan wanking.

325
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Maybe the way they're going to sweeten the pot with Diablo 3 on the Switch is to include the Diablo 2 remaster on the Switch with it. Wouldn't that be something?

326
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I don't know if that...

327
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I warned you it was fan wank.

328
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Alright so anyway but those would probably be the sooner things than like Diablo 4 would be the way out thing.

329
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:20,000
But I'm expecting it to be a very Diablo year at Blizzcon because I mean Overwatch like they might unveil a new character but like Overwatch I don't see them suddenly going we're going to make Overwatch 2.

330
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Like Overwatch League is still kind of like you know Overwatch League we know is going to grow next year and you know I feel like it's still kind of like they don't need to do a lot of it.

331
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I would still love for them to announce we're making like some PvE dedicated stuff that's not part of an event that like there's going to be some year round PvE in the game.

332
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I still would love to see that but I'm not holding my breath on that. I feel like Overwatch is still enough of an attraction that people want to check it out.

333
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
World of Warcraft they've got an expansion coming out next week believe it or not.

334
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So they're not exactly going to announce a new expansion at Blizzcon.

335
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Starcraft?

336
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
They may announce a new patch.

337
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So yeah that leaves Starcraft and Heroes of the Storm.

338
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Well Heroes of the Storm like Overwatch you're not going to they're just going to keep adding to it.

339
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So they're going to be like we have a new battleground some new heroes that's what they'll do with Heroes of the Storm.

340
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So yeah either they're going to unveil something their big unveil has got to be either Starcraft which would mean like a Starcraft 3 or another Starcraft 2 expansion.

341
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I just I just don't think now's the time for Starcraft I think now's the time for Diablo I really do.

342
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Because Starcraft just got that remaster last year that was kind of the big thing so I just it's Diablo's time to shine.

343
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
You'll really do a new game?

344
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:49,000
They could Blizzard could have I mean and then of course I'm neglecting Hearthstone but again Hearthstone is also just an evergreen type of game where they'll say oh we've got another card expansion coming.

345
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Sure Blizzard could always announce a new game why not the last the only time I went to Blizzcon was the year they announced Overwatch and it was a big fucking deal like Overwatch was a very new type of thing for Blizzard.

346
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,000
So I'm sure Blizzard's working on a whole new idea out there somewhere but you know we'll see.

347
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I don't know if this is the year for that either.

348
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Over in chat at live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwool says it's rock and roll racing's time to shine bring back rock and roll racing.

349
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
You know what rock and roll racing would actually make an amazing map in Heroes of the Storm.

350
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So I'm kind of surprised that that isn't something that they're trying to trying to do is like a racing map or like as part of the like the lanes or tracks and then like you could like unveil like as part of like the the mini objectives like cars that would like drive over your enemies and stuff and knock them back.

351
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
That would be really funny but anyway who knows.

352
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
ActDeft in chat says I still want Overwatch on Switch.

353
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Never say never I mean that could be could be a thing could happen.

354
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Alright.

355
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Kaijuto in chat says in the era of microtransaction I'm not happy about a Diablo 2 remake.

356
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Well for what it's worth Kaijuto when they did the Starcraft remake it was just like they didn't inject DLC into it and they didn't inject like other stuff it was like pay $19.99 and get original Starcraft just as it was but with HD graphics.

357
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So I have a feeling if they do a Diablo 2 remaster it's not going to be like it's going to be like if you want to play Diablo 2 with pretty graphics or whatever it's 20 bucks or 30 bucks whatever they end up charging for I don't think they'll suddenly be like and we're putting treasure boxes in it.

358
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I don't think they'll do that.

359
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
No.

360
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I don't think they will.

361
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Alright.

362
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Anyhow let's talk about the Smash Brothers Direct that happened this week.

363
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Did you watch the Smash Brothers Direct?

364
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I did.

365
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I didn't.

366
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I have to admit I'm only mentioning this based on what I've read around the internet and I did I did watch one reveal trailer because I am very excited about Simon Belmont coming to Super Smash Ultimate.

367
00:42:50,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And I realize he's been rumored for a long time but it was it still was something to see that whole unveil trailer with not just death killing Luigi but like all of the all of the bosses were in that little reveal trailer that was pretty badass.

368
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Yeah that's all part of that one level too.

369
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I'm like I never realized I want Nintendo to make a new Castlevania game or I guess maybe if they're having Nanko Bandai's help or whatever but like I'm like damn like they they make Castlevania look real good.

370
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:25,000
So yes Simon Belmont is coming to Super Smash Ultimate and since they're doing this whole shadow characters is that what they're called shadow characters?

371
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Echo Fighters.

372
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Echo Fighters.

373
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Excuse me.

374
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Um padding roster is what they roster padding.

375
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
They're fucking allowed Loki.

376
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
They're fucking allowed.

377
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Honestly after some of the stuff that Sakurai has delivered with this they're fucking allowed to do like elaborate pallet swaps that they want.

378
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I'm totally okay with it.

379
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So yes they're doing Echo Fighter for Richter Belmont in addition to Simon Belmont which I think is badass.

380
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I think I kind of like Richter.

381
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
No Alucard.

382
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I mean I just careful what you wish for.

383
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
You never know.

384
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
So you don't know what's there.

385
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
That was not the only character they unveiled.

386
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
They also unveiled King K. Rool.

387
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
King K. Rool if you if you will.

388
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
The antagonist in the Donkey Kong series.

389
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Well the modern Donkey Kong series not the old ones obviously because the antagonist in the old Donkey Kong game was Mario.

390
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Ha ha.

391
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Plot twist.

392
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
But anyway King K. Rool.

393
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I think.

394
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And more fucking Fire Emblem characters.

395
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Hooray.

396
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Which are also Echo Fighters right?

397
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Yeah.

398
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
King K. Rool is honestly I'm not that excited about that unveil.

399
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Like send your hate mail right on in.

400
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I don't care.

401
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
All the dudes from Contra.

402
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Contra dudes.

403
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
But I'm not that excited.

404
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I mean here's the thing though.

405
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I'm not shitting on Smash Brothers Ultimate by any means.

406
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
This game is going to be fucking fantastic.

407
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And with the roster as big as it is.

408
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Echo Fighters or not.

409
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
They're allowed to have one or two characters that I'm going to go.

410
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
You know what?

411
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I'm just not going to play that character.

412
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I can't wait for the very last director they're going to have at Smash when they announce Waluigi.

413
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Because they're going to save that.

414
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
For the end.

415
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Y'all need to let it go.

416
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Waluigi is not going to be in the fucking game.

417
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And you need to just.

418
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Well he's going to be an assist and that's it.

419
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
And y'all need to let Sakurai get his fucking sleep.

420
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And never ask him for anything ever again.

421
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
It's coming.

422
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
It'll be the last one.

423
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
The very last one.

424
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
No.

425
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
No.

426
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Because this is the thing.

427
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Waluigi does not need his redemption as much as.

428
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Wart.

429
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
The antagonist in Mario Brothers 2.

430
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I agree.

431
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
He's disappeared ever since.

432
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Or half of the other Mario Brothers 2 characters.

433
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Honestly, Wart would make me so fucking happy.

434
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I would cry.

435
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
What about Birdo?

436
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I'll take it.

437
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I'll take Birdo.

438
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
But Wart is really like.

439
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Wart is my like A tier wish list.

440
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Birdo's like B tier.

441
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Birdo could be like an echo fighter for like Yoshi or something.

442
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Going to chat.

443
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Bobby Blackwolf said.

444
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Luigi died and will be replaced by Waluigi.

445
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Well technically Mario died too.

446
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
So there's a lot of death in there.

447
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Let's see.

448
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
SHO 100 Matt points out.

449
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Wart and Mouser were a dream.

450
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
You know what?

451
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Some dreams are real.

452
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Dreams are a reflection of reality.

453
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Are they not?

454
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Anyway.

455
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I just think they need to go obscure.

456
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Captain Rainbow.

457
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Let's put Tingle in there.

458
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Fuck yeah.

459
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Let's put Tingle.

460
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
He has an actual fighter.

461
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Fuck this assist shit.

462
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Do you know what's funny though?

463
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Since I talk about like people need to fucking leave Sakurai alone and all this stuff.

464
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Did you know he actually went to Twitter this week?

465
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
And a translated version of the tweet reads like this.

466
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Again, I'll do my best for the presentation tomorrow.

467
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
It'll start at a relatively convenient time in Japan.

468
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So please watch it.

469
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
My eyes might be a little red.

470
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
That's because they're a little tired.

471
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Because people are kind of noticing that Sakurai looks like he's fucking been through it.

472
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Like he looks like he has been through it.

473
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
So that's why I'm saying you Waluigi fucks need to leave him alone.

474
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Leave Sakurai alone!

475
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
He's created the greatest, one of the greatest video games of all time.

476
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Leave him alone!

477
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
That was my attempt to mimic leave Britney alone to make success.

478
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Anyway.

479
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And you know, keep in mind during all of this, like this game is in crunch time right now.

480
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
So this is like, and this game is already announced.

481
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Like it is happening for the holidays.

482
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
It is not getting pushed back.

483
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
So you know what, Sakurai is probably having a rough life right now.

484
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I just hope, you know what, when he has finished the game and he's released it and it sold 11 billion copies,

485
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I hope he gets a fucking vacation.

486
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
You know what, he can do what Barack Obama's done.

487
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
He can fucking take a vacation and not look back on this shithole of a country.

488
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,000
That's what he can do when he's earned his due.

489
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
He can just take a vacation and never come back.

490
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
He's earned it.

491
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I'm not saying he should never develop again.

492
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
No, I love him and he should.

493
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:07,000
But if he wants to take a nice long vacation for like two years, he is allowed.

494
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:15,000
SSG100Matt says he wanted a vacation after Smash 4, but Nintendo wouldn't let him.

495
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Well that's why I'm saying Nintendo, give the man a fucking break.

496
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Anyway, let's move on. More news, Loki.

497
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,000
So Nintendo, speaking of, well, I don't know if they're not necessarily giving people a break,

498
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,000
but they have that whole lawsuit against Love Roms for of course storing ROMs of their games on there

499
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
and they've taken them to court for that.

500
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:45,000
So kind of spooked by that, MU Paradise is actually announcing that they have,

501
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
based on the recent legal action of other ROM sites,

502
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:56,000
they'll be changing and ceasing to offer ROM versions of Nintendo's and other companies' older games.

503
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
It's not worth it for us to risk potentially disastrous consequences.

504
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I cannot in good conscience risk the future of our team members who have contributed to the site throughout the years.

505
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:14,000
We run MU Paradise for the love of retro games and for you to be able to revisit those good times.

506
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Unfortunately, it's not possible right now to do so in a way that makes everyone happy and keeps us out of trouble.

507
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:28,000
So they've decided to make a new start. We will continue to be passionate retro gamers

508
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
and we'll continue doing cool stuff around retro games.

509
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
But you won't be able to get your games from here for now.

510
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Where we go with this is up to you.

511
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Well, what can you say? I mean, the games will be elsewhere. They will always be elsewhere.

512
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
This is the internet. One site goes down, another one goes up.

513
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,000
So I think as far as the website MU Paradise is concerned, now it's kind of a test of the community over there.

514
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Without the ROMs, are they still going to have the community to keep that site?

515
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
They're never going to stop ROMs from being on the internet. They're everywhere.

516
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
All it's going to do if they really start hammering down on these ROM sites is just going to push it more underground.

517
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
You know, we were talking a little bit about this at the end of Bobby's show this week.

518
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I don't want to repeat myself too much, but as much as I respect Nintendo's right to protect these games that they made in the 80s.

519
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:29,000
You know what? You can't pirate Disney movies that were made in the 60s and the 50s as much as you want to.

520
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
You can't just pirate and copy those movies.

521
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
So if Nintendo wants to enforce the trademark on their games, they have that right whether you like it or not.

522
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:45,000
But I also think you don't want to take ROMs away completely because there is a lot that can be learned about game development from them.

523
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
There's a lot that can be unveiled about games that never existed in the first place.

524
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
And what we've learned from the failures of that.

525
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And there are some developers that have made arcade games that were emulated in MAME.

526
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:10,000
And the guys that made the original arcade games released their source public domain to be like,

527
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Sure, emulate all you want. Learn from what we developed. Learn how we made the games. Use this to learn.

528
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,000
So I think I would never want to see emulation go away completely.

529
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Absolutely not because I think there's so much to learn from those that are fine with their stuff being released to the public.

530
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Once again though, I don't even know.

531
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Robbie Roto or whatever that game is that was released not that long ago.

532
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Well, it was probably like five years ago at this point.

533
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I understand that they would have to enforce their copyrights or they lose it.

534
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,000
But at the same time, I don't think that pirating ROMs is necessarily...

535
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Well, first off, I mean, like if you own copies of the games and you're just getting a ROM dump of it,

536
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I don't see the problem there in the first place.

537
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And second off, is it really affecting the sales of these things?

538
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I've downloaded full ROM sets of the NES library and Super NES library like dozens of times.

539
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I still bought those ROMs. Like I bought them originally when they were out in the NES.

540
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I bought them on the Super NES. I bought them on the Wii.

541
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I bought them on the 3DS when I had it. I bought them on the Wii U.

542
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I bought the Super NES Classic, so it's not affecting my purchasing of their stuff.

543
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Believe it or not, I'm like right with you there.

544
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Of course I've downloaded a shit ton of ROMs in my day,

545
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:38,000
but I still support way more than I'd like to admit of the Virtual Console stuff that Nintendo and likewise put out.

546
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Even like the Sega Genesis collection. How many times have I bought the Sega Genesis collection on different systems?

547
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Like PC, Playstation 3, Playstation 4? Like a lot, okay?

548
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,000
And I'm even still eyeing like, do I want one of those Sega Genesis plastic consoles that they sell at Target?

549
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Same thing with Atari Flashback. You can fit the entire Atari library on an old floppy disk.

550
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Like those games are itty bitty. That's part of what's so fucking impressive about how so many of them were programmed is that those games are so small in the data.

551
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
But anyway, like, you know, the entire Atari 2600 library is not that big.

552
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I'm still sitting here going, I kind of want to get an Atari Flashback 8 with all the Activision games on it.

553
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Like just because they're that good. And I buy the Atari stuff like, you know, anyway.

554
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
So I just don't understand like, what is, I mean I get that they're-

555
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Emulation is emulation. It's emulating the real thing. It's not the real thing.

556
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
They weren't coming after these companies like, I mean this stuff has been out there forever.

557
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
So I don't understand like, why now they decided to like, come after these companies.

558
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I mean, my thought is just that like, do you really want to turn people like, against like, not necessarily turning against them because of-

559
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
But like, when it starts with these emulation sites and then eventually it's going to move to,

560
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Oh hey, these are the guys that are actually, you know, getting the archives of the stuff for historical preservation.

561
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
And now you're going to come after them. Because it's once, it's going to just eventually lead up to that.

562
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I hope not. I mean, you know, honestly, I realize that those words aren't going to hold a lot of weight.

563
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:21,000
But I just, I really hope not. Especially, you know, with some of the great things a lot of video game preservationists are trying to do.

564
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:30,000
You know, I would really hope Nintendo would respect that like, what those guys are doing is not about trying to just like, distribute a shit ton of ROMs.

565
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And, you know, and whatever, and derail Virtual Console or whatever Nintendo wants to invent in their mind.

566
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
But there are people that really do want to preserve video game history as an art form.

567
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:48,000
As, you know, there is a film, what is it, the Film Preservation Society or whatever, maybe one of you guys in chat knows the exact name of this.

568
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,000
They select like 20 or 25 films a year to be preserved like forever type of thing.

569
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Or the way that books get preserved in a library and in like, you know, a national library and so forth.

570
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Like, you know, video games are an art form that deserve to have some preservation efforts taken around them because discs rot.

571
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Servers go down and they go away forever. But there ought to be a way that, you know, the future can play these games too.

572
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Just like, you know, it's funny, Melody and I were talking the other day about, you know, some of the stuff we were, I was, because I was joking.

573
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Because when the baby was trying to grab my finger, I started to get an Xbox controller and I was like, here, you should start learning on this.

574
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
And Melody says, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we're going to make her play 8-bit games first.

575
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Then she's going to play 16-bit and we're going to, and I've heard a lot of new parents say this type of thing.

576
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Like, we're going to work them through the generations just like we did it.

577
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:50,000
But it's like, whoa, what if, what if the 8-bit games, the 16-bit games aren't there to do that with?

578
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I mean, sure, Super Mario Brothers will probably always be released on every Nintendo system ever.

579
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
But what about the Guardian Legend?

580
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I consider the Guardian Legend to be an 8-bit classic that I fucking grew up on that, like, makes me part of, like, the gamer fan that I am today.

581
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:13,000
That game has never been available on Virtual Console, any type of legal collection.

582
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
If it were not for emulation, I couldn't play the Guardian Legend.

583
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
You couldn't play the Guardian Legend to see what is it that Rob loves so much about this fucking game.

584
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I bought you a copy of the Guardian Legend.

585
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Yeah, I actually have the Guardian Legend, like, three different times on cartridge, but I'm okay with that.

586
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I am totally okay with that. You know what I mean?

587
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:39,000
It's like, you know, if I don't have a working Nintendo and a cartridge like that, there is no other legal way for me to play it.

588
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
And I don't want that game to go away.

589
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:51,000
And there's going to be some games that just fall in this weird fucking tricky legal void because one company swallowed another company, swallowed another company, where if it wasn't for emulation, it wouldn't be able to do this.

590
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,000
So, anyway, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

591
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,000
SSJ100Matt says, Sounds like this baby is going to be a future OLR co-host in 18 years.

592
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Well, you know, that's the plan, is to hand it off to Josh and Julian in the future.

593
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:13,000
And then possibly other new kids as well.

594
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
That way it will always keep the crown of longest running gaming podcasts.

595
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:25,000
How have you done a gaming podcast for 100 years? Well, it all started many years ago.

596
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about some changes with Twitch.

597
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Let's talk about newer things, very new things.

598
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Another way we kind of preserve games through video and broadcasting.

599
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
So, Twitch is going to be making some big changes.

600
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
When I saw the headline, I actually got the email about this, as did many of you Twitch users.

601
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
And when I first saw that the email said, we're getting rid of communities, I was a little bit sad.

602
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Because I actually really like the communities for discoverability, especially being part of the LGBT family on Twitch.

603
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I am always using LGBT to find, you know, other streamers on Twitch that are in that family as well.

604
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
So, when I first read this, I was like, this is really sad.

605
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
But I also realized that most of the communities, I'm using my quoting fingers.

606
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Most of the communities on Twitch are named after games.

607
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:25,000
And it's like, you shouldn't need a community for Super Smash Brothers because you put that you're streaming Super Smash Brothers and people will find it.

608
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
You don't need communities based on games, you know what I mean?

609
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,000
So, I guess to some extent Twitch has kind of realized that this is going on too.

610
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
So, they're changing it.

611
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:40,000
And I must admit, once I read fully the changes, I'm okay with it.

612
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
In fact, actually, I do think it's going to be for the better in the long run.

613
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
So, here's the deal, they're going to have a new tagging system.

614
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
So, you'll be able to tag your streams.

615
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,000
And they, LGBT specifically, they actually called out in the email specifically the LGBT streamers.

616
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
And they mentioned that that will be a tag.

617
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:05,000
But they're also going to do tags for like, first time playthrough, game development, speed runs, you know, all these like different types of things.

618
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:12,000
And I did appreciate that Twitch was very open to be like, here is a spreadsheet of all of the tags we're going to be introducing.

619
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
And if you don't think we have something captured here, like let us know, reply to this email.

620
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I don't know if this only went to affiliates maybe, but I feel like everybody probably got it.

621
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Maybe it was just an affiliate thing.

622
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Hopefully it wasn't under NDA.

623
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:32,000
But anyway, I mean, honestly, you know, I think it's great what Twitch is doing to try to proactively get out there and listen to the feedback from the community.

624
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
There's also going to be more categories that are going to be added to Twitch as well.

625
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Things that are going to help make things more specific than just IRL and creative.

626
00:59:42,000 --> 01:00:01,000
So, they're going to break these down into art, hobbies and crafts, food and drink, music and performing arts, beauty and body art, science and technology, just chatting, traveling outdoors, sports and fitness, tabletop RPGs, special events, talk shows and podcasts, and ASMR.

627
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Which, you know, for those of you that like to have your gaming streams like this, and now I'm going to slowly click the buttons as I play the game.

628
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Have you ever tried to get into that? Alan loves that ASMR.

629
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I watched one. It was, I think it was a parody, but it was still ASMR. It was like ASMR bank robbery.

630
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:42,000
If that's what you're into, look, Alan like loves that stuff. And I tease him. I'm only teasing because I love and like, honestly, like, I my like nothing for me for ASMR. Nothing is ever going to beat the pickle lady.

631
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:52,000
There's that there's that lady on YouTube. I don't know her name. Maybe somebody who knows it. She's infamous. And she's sitting there and she's got like she shoves this gigantic ass fucking pickle in her mouth and she's just about to choose down.

632
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:05,000
And it's just like all this noise. And I'm like, damn, that's impressive. But I guess some people like just like really sensitive to that type of noise, like it's very relaxing.

633
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Just like how some people could like, well, I'm sure there's a lot of people that want to sleep with a white noise machine. Whereas I can't stand those things. But for some people, it really helps them.

634
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:26,000
So, hmm. Anyway, looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, SSJ100Matt says, sounds like NPR just needs some smooth jazz in the back.

635
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Let's see. Tigerclaw says, I sleep with a white noise machine, a fan.

636
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Raginator says, just watch. The tagging will get abused in ways the Twitch isn't foreseeing. And eventually they'll say, yeah, we didn't see this going to shit in a dumpster fire.

637
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Well, Raginator, for what it's worth, you're not going to be able to invent your own tags. You do have to use the tags that are there.

638
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:52,000
And especially with so many affiliates and partners and things, you don't want to get kicked out of those programs by doing something stupid with the tagging program.

639
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:59,000
So, I mean, obviously it's not going to be perfect 100% with the time. There's always going to be some trolls. But I think for the most part, it should be OK.

640
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:14,000
So, anyway. Anyway, Kaijuto in chat says, Twitch blows with these tags. I'd be curious, a more elaborated version of that comment. Like, what do you not like about that? I'd be curious.

641
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Because I'm open to it. I realize that communities probably aren't working quite as they were intended. I like them, but it also really annoys me that the Xbox version of Twitch,

642
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:35,000
and I realize Microsoft's got the whole Mixer thing going on, so maybe Twitch isn't as, you know, wanting to get updated on Xbox. But it really annoys me that the community search isn't on the Xbox version of Twitch.

643
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:50,000
And I don't even think it works on the, even the new PlayStation one. I don't think has it. I could be wrong. But I'm kind of annoyed that, so I hope if they do bring the tagging, that they will update the viewer on all these different, you know, systems they have them on to support the tags as well.

644
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,000
That would be, that would be wonderful. Alright, a few more stories before we get to the classic game of the week. Loki?

645
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Alright, so this is something that's been going on this week. There was this review by a now former IGN editor by the name of Felipe Musen, and he was fired because apparently it was thought that he plagiarized his review from a YouTube channel.

646
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:32,000
So he had a, there was a YouTuber by the name of Boomstick Gaming that did a review for Dead Cells, and it came out several days earlier.

647
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:46,000
And then he released his review on IGN, and then of course Boomstick Gaming kind of noticed that, and they put out a video comparing the two saying, hey, he plagiarized my review.

648
01:03:46,000 --> 01:04:02,000
And so then IGN reviewed it, and they took down the review and basically fired him because they thought I guess as well that he did, you know, I guess enough of the review was taken from the other one.

649
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Then on top of that though, so after that whole drama happens, there's other articles coming out, people start looking at his other reviews, and apparently his FIFA 18 review is also very similar to, the FIFA 18 Switch review is very similar to what was on Nintendo Life.

650
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:29,000
And also apparently he had done this maybe with even some other reviews for other games.

651
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:40,000
But he had come out on his YouTube channel and basically said, you know, the bottom line is that what happened with Dead Cells reviews was not at all intentional.

652
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:53,000
So with all that said, I just want to apologize to everybody at IGN for the undeserved criticisms and doubts that many may have sparked in their credibility as a respected source for games media.

653
01:04:53,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Basically saying, you know, yeah, it was just a coincidence that I happened to use a similar phrasing to these other channels and stuff, but it's just a little too close to what it was.

654
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:17,000
So he sort of admitted that there's a problem and then said, but it wasn't a problem. I really feel like there's a complete contradiction even within this YouTube thing.

655
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:33,000
And then apparently there's also a third review that he had done as well, and Gadget had posted a review of Metroid Samus Returns last September, and then about five days later he posted his own review of the game, which is also very similar in the wording of that.

656
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I don't know if he's just happened to be maybe copying styles of these other reviews or if he's just not playing these games and just reviewing them based on, you know, I don't know.

657
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:57,000
But it's a pattern, and it's not a good pattern. That's not very favorable if you want to get into, you know, the writing industry.

658
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Especially when so few opportunities are available, and I can't tell you how many people I know and that I follow online who have this lifelong dream of doing journalism.

659
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:20,000
And journalism right now is really fucking hard because nobody's buying newspapers and magazines. I shouldn't say nobody, but far less than what used to are buying newspapers and magazines anymore.

660
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Everybody's going to the internet where everybody ad blocks because, you know, because unfortunately, and I sort of think the ad industry is solely to blame for that, I don't think people would be ad blocking if the ads didn't get ridiculously intrusive.

661
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Well, not only ridiculously intrusive, but containing malware and other shit.

662
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:51,000
But anyway, that's a whole nother Oprah. But the reality is because of those reasons, whatever they are, because people have ruined it for everyone else and people are ad blocking, like, you know, there isn't a lot of money to be made there.

663
01:06:51,000 --> 01:07:08,000
So it's like it is really fucking hard to be a journalist right now. And those opportunities are few and far between. So to hear that somebody was able to get into IGN only to do this is like, that's kind of a slap in the face to everybody who's working really fucking hard to break into that.

664
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:37,000
And like can't because they just the right opportunity just doesn't fucking come up. And it also goes a long way in saying, you know, I maybe I'm probably gonna regret what I'm about to say, but what it also goes a long way in saying like, what's the difference between these big organizations and the YouTubes that they do, and the podcast that they do, and their fucking opinions, and the independence and our fucking opinions? What's the difference?

665
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Well, this should probably demonstrate to you not much, because if this guy did a YouTube thing on Metroid Samus returns, it took this long for him to get fucking caught.

666
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Well, yeah, yeah, this thing. Yeah. But he's done this multiple times.

667
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:58,000
So when you come to me and say, well, IGN said this, or, you know, GameSpot said this, that's why sometimes I say, so fucking what?

668
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Those reviews, though, weren't necessarily on IGN. So the other two, the FIFA and the other one were on his YouTube channel.

669
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Fair enough. So IGN was just the dead cells one. But, you know, it's hard, like YouTube and the Internet is a big place, and it's hard to scrutinize every single review out there.

670
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:31,000
So it's just, you know, in this case, it had to be the reviewer that did the actual review in the first place, noticing that, hey, IGN has a review that sounds just like mine.

671
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
That's odd. And, you know, pointing it out.

672
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:41,000
MXC in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, I do not believe this person's response to the plagiarism allegations.

673
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:47,000
As someone who writes reviews, I very specifically avoid looking at anyone else's reviews, previews, etc., before writing my own.

674
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I don't want to compromise my opinion, etc., or inadvertently use a similar phrase or reference.

675
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,000
With that said, it's incredibly clear that this is a case of plagiarism from the writing.

676
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,000
He did more work than a typical high school plagiarist, but things are still written in the same order.

677
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:09,000
You know, and I do want to clarify something, because even though I'm saying what's the difference between IGN and GameSpot and all this stuff and us,

678
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I do think there are some journalists that are doing a really great job.

679
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:24,000
What can these journalists do that go beyond even maybe what, you know, independents have the time or resources, I suppose, to be able to do?

680
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:32,000
And to give credit where credit is due, and this is really going to surprise some of you guys, but it just goes to show that opinions can change, people can change, places can change.

681
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:38,000
But I was really impressed with Kotaku's reporting on what went on over at Riot Games.

682
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
And that was a big thing that just came out. Was that this past week, or was that two weeks ago?

683
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:55,000
But that was some impressive fucking six months plus worth of really trying to crack what was a hard nut to crack because they'd scared all these people into not talking.

684
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:04,000
So I do want to give credit where credit is due, even though I'm saying, especially when it comes to opinions, reviews, things like that, what's the difference between them and us, not much.

685
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:15,000
But when you have the resources, when you have the contacts, when you have that time to really try to get into it and get to the core of things, there are several people out there doing some very impressive things.

686
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:21,000
And those are the types of things that journalists can be doing that are really, really good.

687
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:29,000
And I know I have spoken very critically of Kotaku in the past on this show, but that was also many years ago and many things have changed over there since then.

688
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:40,000
So actually, I don't find them nearly as bad as I used to. In fact, I actually kind of like them, especially after things like this last incident with the Riot Games reporting.

689
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I thought that was really fucking well done. So anyway, and Dungeon Buster does clarify the Riot Games story was this past week.

690
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
It didn't make our list for tonight. Well, I guess I ended up bringing it up anyway.

691
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Well, tonight's the night where I'm going to say things. I'm going to get in trouble. Ready? So do you want to know what my reaction was when I read that story?

692
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I didn't read the story. Have you ever seen Sexism or something in the works?

693
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Absolutely. It's bad. It's bad. They really give, from multiple perspectives, documented incidents of how the sexism is kind of rampant in that place.

694
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:31,000
And all I have to say is my reaction was I was really glad I didn't take that job that I was going for in 2012. That's all I'm going to say. Moving on.

695
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:39,000
We got one more story to talk about. All right. Let's talk about Doom Eternal.

696
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Doom Eternal is coming to PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and get this Nintendo Switch.

697
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Yeah, because they had QuakeCon this week, wasn't it?

698
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Bethesda loves Doom Eternal, don't they? Bobby Blackwolf spelling it differently in chat, saying Do-Maternal. Doom Eternal. Sorry if I'm not enunciating correctly for you.

699
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:07,000
But anyway, Doom Eternal was shown off at QuakeCon, and it is going to be confirmed for all the systems, including Switch.

700
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Panic Button is doing the Switch port. They did the Doom port, which many people seem to be pretty cool with.

701
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:21,000
So I guess it looks like it's kind of just a sequel to Doom, but it's going to have some new stuff in it. And that would be the 2016 Doom, not the really old ones.

702
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:29,000
There's a new dash movement, there's a blade, a super shotgun, meat hook. There's going to be more demons in Doom Eternal.

703
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:35,000
And you can actually have players that turn into demons in another player's campaign. That's straight out of Dark Souls, isn't it?

704
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Yeah, or Demon Souls.

705
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:46,000
And then they were showing some effects where, like, as you blow up the monsters, you can blow them up slowly. Like, little pieces of their flesh fall off the more you attack them and stuff.

706
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:55,000
So, yep, that's a thing that exists in the world. But no, hey, the Doom reboot was great, so I'm pretty excited about the new game.

707
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:09,000
There will be post-launch campaign DLC. SnapMap is not going to be coming back for Doom Eternal. Those were some other little tidbits that were shared at QuakeCon, where id did the big unveil of the game.

708
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
So, that's Doom. Are you going to check out Doom Eternal?

709
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
I didn't check out the first one.

710
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
What?

711
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I didn't even check out the first one.

712
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:27,000
You should. It's very fast-paced, but it's very good. Especially now they have it on the Switch. I mean, the Switch, it shows a little bit, but it's not a bad port by any means.

713
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I just play it on PC.

714
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:34,000
And honestly, that's nothing against Switch or any of it. It's just keyboard and mouse for me when it comes to those games.

715
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
And Dungeon Buster in chat agrees. It's good, Loki. Give it a try.

716
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Yeah, but you see, I have a library of 560 games in Steam, and, you know, I'm not going to play it. I can buy it, and I won't play it. There was a game I just bought recently.

717
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:58,000
I know there's another big game that I bought recently, and I still haven't played it yet, so I don't even... I can't even remember what it is.

718
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Well, I'm happy you just got to Horizon this week.

719
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Yes, Horizon.

720
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
That's one that I still need to play, so...

721
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
It's great.

722
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:09,000
All right. Well, we're going to go from newer games to some classic games.

723
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,000
And thanks to the magic of radio, we're joined right now by the one and only Dark Sakura.

724
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Hi.

725
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Hi, you're here.

726
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Yes.

727
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
It's magic.

728
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
You took me on adventures.

729
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I know. I'm going to take... Would you like to go on a journey?

730
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Magical adventure.

731
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,000
It's a magical adventure. Just get in the van that says magic adventure.

732
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
By the way...

733
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Way?

734
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:36,000
We called somebody at work today a unicorn, and I said, you're in danger if Tim Curry comes by in a devil suit.

735
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
So let's talk about a classic game of the week as old as that reference.

736
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Yes.

737
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Because every week Dark Sakura jumps into the gaming vault.

738
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Whether she's here or not, she will be here through magic to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, brat, play this, or I will...

739
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
This one's all sticky.

740
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
I will send Tim Curry to eat you.

741
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Don't let kids play arcade games when their hands are chocolaty.

742
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
What's the classic game of the week, Dark Sakura?

743
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Robotron 2084.

744
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:10,000
So, also known as Robotron, because that's what we called it.

745
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
It is an arcade game that was developed by Eugene Jarvis and Larry DeMar of VidKids.

746
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
And whoever remembers the numbers anyway.

747
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Yes.

748
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
And it was released by Williams.

749
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Of course, you know, there's a lot more Williams things in my house that are pinball, but we'll not go there.

750
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
It is a 2D shoot-em-up.

751
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:36,000
And basically, in 2084, the robots have taken over in a cybernetic revolt.

752
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,000
And you have to defeat the robots, rescue the humans.

753
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I look at this as kind of a precursor to Smash TV, to be honest.

754
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
You know?

755
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Yes.

756
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Because especially with the whole double joystick thing.

757
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Yeah.

758
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
It is the game that made twin sticks popular.

759
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:56,000
It had previously been used in a game called Mars and in Taito Space Dungeon in 1981.

760
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Although, it originated in the game Gun Fight from 1975.

761
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
But who's played those?

762
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I think if I ever did Gun Fight, it would be the second game that came out before I was born.

763
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Unless, did Pong came out before? Yeah, Pong came out before I was born, too.

764
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Yes, and you did Space War on one episode.

765
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
The 1950 radar. You did the radar love.

766
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
You've done some old stuff, Dark Sakura.

767
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Yeah.

768
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Well, anyway, this game is also listed as one of Jarvis's best contributions to video games.

769
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
So, it's pretty, pretty notable.

770
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
So, basically, you have a top-down perspective.

771
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
You just shoot stuff and try to rescue all the humans.

772
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
You have different waves of robots and different obstacles that are in there.

773
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
And you basically just have to survive.

774
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:42,000
And this is also, this particular game, it did feature mono sound.

775
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And it's a raster game.

776
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
So, this was, like, right around the era that they were doing all the vector stuff.

777
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
And it looks fairly vector, but it really is a raster game.

778
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
It was on a 19-inch CRT.

779
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:59,000
It used a Motorola 6809 central processing unit that operated at one whole megahertz.

780
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Wow.

781
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Right?

782
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:06,000
And it actually had this neat thing where it used, like, this scheming programming

783
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
to generate sounds in order of importance so that it would sound like it was a multi-audio channel

784
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
when really it was monaural.

785
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:20,000
It also had a custom graphics coprocessor that basically generated the on-screen objects

786
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
and visual effects independently of the rest of it.

787
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,000
And it could also transfer memory space so that the game would stay fast

788
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
and animate a large number of things at one time.

789
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
So, this game actually is fairly innovative for its time.

790
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:37,000
And some of these later stages got crazy amounts of stuff going on.

791
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
So, this game took six months to develop.

792
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Just six months.

793
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:47,000
And VidKids was actually a consulting firm that designed games for Williams.

794
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,000
And Jarvis and DeMar did work for Williams before.

795
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:58,000
So, the game was meant to be exciting, like an athletic experience that had a physical element with the twin sticks.

796
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:06,000
And then it was basically meant to give a conflicting goal to avoid attacks,

797
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,000
to defeat the enemies, and to save a family to earn your points.

798
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
So, it really was these contrasting things.

799
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,000
It was also inspired by the Stern game, Berserk.

800
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
And also a game for the Commodore PET called Chase.

801
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
So, and I'm sure that I don't need to go into those games.

802
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
We pretty much know what they are.

803
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
And the dual joystick design was developed by Mr. Jarvis there,

804
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:36,000
who was inspired by an automobile accident and playing Berserk.

805
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:42,000
He had injured his right hand, so he couldn't play the game to test it.

806
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
So, he had to be able to use his left hand as well.

807
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
So, that's where the joysticks came from.

808
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:52,000
He also created a second type of game like this to aim projectiles and things.

809
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:59,000
And so, he created a prototype using a Stargate arcade system board and two Atari 2600 controllers.

810
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,000
So, it basically led to the game we have here.

811
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Other things about the game, as far as its story, it was inspired by 1984, the story by George Orwell.

812
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Although this, of course, game did predate Terminator.

813
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
So, who knows, maybe Terminator was inspired by this.

814
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:26,000
But they wanted to do a more realistic time frame for the Big Brother theory.

815
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Big Brother is watching you.

816
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Of course, if robots do take over 1984, then I'm gonna say that they were pretty pathetic, don't you think?

817
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
And they also did all the play testing themselves.

818
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Well, if I'm alive in 2084, I will be 106.

819
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Girl.

820
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:51,000
So, I mean, here's hoping, but I'm thinking I'll be too senile to realize it if robots take over.

821
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I'll probably see one of those enemies in this game with the brain that flashes all the different colors.

822
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
And I'll be like, it's shiny!

823
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Well, basically, the game gets harder and harder and harder as it goes on.

824
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
When are they gonna make a game that gets easier?

825
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
When are they gonna make a game that gets easier?

826
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
They should call it Be Rich.

827
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
And the richer you get, the easier stuff gets.

828
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Privilege the game.

829
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Yeah, exactly.

830
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:23,000
So, in 2012, though, Eugene Jarvis wrote an evaluation of the Robotron enemy dynamics.

831
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:32,000
So the game is hardcoded with 40 waves, whereupon the game repeats wave 21 through 40 over and over until the game restarts back to original wave 1.

832
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
That's after wave 255 has been completed.

833
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:41,000
And so he actually put out a whole thing on there and gave details on how to trigger the secret room in Robotron.

834
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
So, the game was great.

835
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
It sold quite well.

836
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:50,000
It sold 19,000 arcade cabinets, and many cabs and cocktail versions were also later produced.

837
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
The different versions have become rarities.

838
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Cocktail and cabaret versions are very rare, while the upright cabinets are more available.

839
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:03,000
It is one of the most collected arcade cabinets.

840
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:10,000
And, of course, it led to, of course, all kinds of other games and different things.

841
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,000
It actually has an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records.

842
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:19,000
It was listed as the number 11 arcade game with technical, creative, and cultural impact.

843
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:30,000
And it really, you know, the audio design on it, there's just really a lot going on for it.

844
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I mean, I know I've already been into the technical aspects of it, but it really was, the simplicity of its gameplay was really a strong point.

845
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:43,000
But it was kind of a technical marvel under the hood for what it did at the time with what it had.

846
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:48,000
And you can say it's simple, but, like, if you're good at this game, like, you get gamer cred.

847
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Because this game isn't easy, at least I don't think it's easy at all.

848
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Well, and Eugene Jarvis, I mean, he also did Defender and Smash TV.

849
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
So, like I said, precursor to Smash TV.

850
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,000
If anything, I'd say Smash TV was the spiritual sequel to Robotron.

851
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:07,000
I'd buy it. They're very similar in many ways, especially with the twin-stick shooting and all that.

852
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
So there have been other remakes and sequels.

853
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:16,000
There was a game called Blaster, which was the official sequel, set in the same universe in 2085.

854
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,000
It actually is a little bit more maze-like with how you have to move around it.

855
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
And it's pretty freaking hard.

856
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:32,000
And then, of course, there were other kinds of remakes for the Atari 5200, the 7800, the Apple IIe, Commodore 64, and the TI-99 4A.

857
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:39,000
It also has releases on PlayStation 2 and Xbox compilations, the Midway Arcade Treasures.

858
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,000
There's a web-based version of it that runs in Shockwave.

859
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,000
So you have no reason not to try this game. Get your Shockwave on.

860
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Shockwave is still supported.

861
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:57,000
So, also, Midway was going to do a plug-and-play version as part of their line of TV games, but it never came out.

862
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:02,000
So you can download it via Xbox. Well, you could download it via Xbox Live Arcade.

863
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:07,000
And it was taken down in February 2010 because it had some permission issues.

864
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
That's weird.

865
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:14,000
I think it is on the Xbox One backwards compatible anyway, though, which is weird.

866
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:21,000
So Jeff Minter, the other developer, did a game called Lomatron based on the design.

867
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:27,000
And then there is another one that came out on iOS called Minitron 2112.

868
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
There's also Robotron 2.

869
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Electric Boogaloo.

870
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,000
It was a project that never actually came out.

871
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:40,000
They were really working on it because Demar went back to pinball development and Jarvis went back to college.

872
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:47,000
So they made an appearance. The robots in the game made an appearance in pixels.

873
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Did anyone see that movie?

874
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
They also mentioned it in Ready Player One, the novel.

875
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,000
And there's a modified version of the game in Fallout 4's DLC, Automatron.

876
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:06,000
So they're also the world of Robotron 2084 appears in Lego dimensions in a portion of the level called All Your Bricks Are Belong to Us.

877
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
And there you go. Robotron 2084.

878
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
All right. There it is.

879
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Before we say goodbye to Jamie, anything else that you want to let the listeners know for the week since I know you don't get to sit in on the whole show?

880
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Anything? Pineapple is delicious.

881
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Pineapple is delicious.

882
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:27,000
I'm planning on trying to make every fourth Sunday to make it, but I have to have time off because I have to pay my bills.

883
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
But until then...

884
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Linda eats a lot, OK?

885
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Until then, Radio Magic.

886
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Radio Magic.

887
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:37,000
All right. Until next week, there it is, your classic game of the week, Robotron 2084.

888
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Isn't Radio Magic awesome?

889
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Anyway, here we are on episode number 741 of our show for this, August the 12th of 2018.

890
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Continuing on with our program here with just Loki and myself in studio.

891
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Dark Sakura gonna be absent from the show here in studio for some time.

892
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
But we do have Radio Magic, as we just did there.

893
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
So we'll be able to get her tuned in through Radio Magic.

894
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:13,000
And hopefully, as she mentioned at the end there, fourth weekends of the month and so forth as her work can allow it.

895
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:22,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase HIP.

896
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news. Loki.

897
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Yes, so Nintendo has confirmed that the launch of Nintendo Switch Online will launch in the second half of September.

898
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
So they announced on Twitter.

899
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:52,000
And of course, as they mentioned, the service will provide access to online play and save game data, cloud backups, incompatible games, and a growing library of NES titles that will be added with online play.

900
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,000
All right, I'll believe it when I see it.

901
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Give me some, I want to see the receipts.

902
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
I want to see the receipts.

903
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:03,000
I will believe it when I see it because, you know, promises.

904
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I'm waiting, waiting to see it.

905
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
All right.

906
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:20,000
And then in movie news, we've got some more confirmations of who's going to be doing some voice work and in the Sonic the Hedgehog movie.

907
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
So Sonic is going to be voiced by Ben Schwartz.

908
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:31,000
That's right, Ben Schwartz, who you may remember from various projects like Parks and Rec.

909
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Or actually, he does the voice of Dewey on DuckTales, the reboot now.

910
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,000
He's going to be doing Sonic the Hedgehog.

911
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
So that'll be interesting.

912
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Want to check that out.

913
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:59,000
And as we mentioned before, Jim Carrey has confirmed that he will be playing Dr. Robotnik in the upcoming movie and basically said, you know, that his portrayal will be live action.

914
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Oh, boy.

915
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
I love Jim Carrey, so of course I'll have to see this movie.

916
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I still, there's a part of me that still feels like this movie is going to be so god awful.

917
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:11,000
But like, then again, I just saw Mamma Mia 2 and I loved it.

918
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
But here's the thing.

919
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
When I saw Mamma Mia 2, I knew exactly what I was saying.

920
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Like, people ask me, was Mamma Mia 2 good?

921
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:24,000
And my answer to that is, look, you need to know exactly what you're going to see.

922
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:34,000
You're not just going to see a silly musical filled with ABBA songs to make you feel good and cry at the same time, but you're seeing a sequel to a movie filled with ABBA songs.

923
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
So if you know exactly what you're going to go see, then it's fine.

924
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
It will meet your expectations.

925
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:50,000
So I feel like Sonic the Hedgehog is one of those movies where I'm also going to need to go into it going, all right, y'all, I'm seeing a movie based on Sonic the Hedgehog.

926
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Oscar nominee, it will not be.

927
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Except, I guess...

928
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
It could win most popular.

929
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Yeah, I guess now.

930
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Maybe it could because the Oscars will let anything in now.

931
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Anything for ratings.

932
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Yup.

933
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Yup.

934
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Yeah, I'll have to check it out.

935
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:19,000
They also posted, I saw there was a post of a set pic that shows a sign saying, welcome to Green Hill.

936
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Green Hill is a little town with a big heart.

937
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Well, it looks better than the sign for a Schitt's Creek if you've ever seen that show.

938
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I love that show.

939
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
I was going to say, Loki, if you've never seen Schitt's Creek, I think you did.

940
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
That show is hilarious.

941
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I know, that show is so fucking funny.

942
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Anyway, I need to watch more.

943
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
I've always seen like half the first season, but they're on like season four or five, right?

944
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Yeah, I kind of stopped watching that.

945
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Oh god. But it's funny.

946
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
It is funny, yeah.

947
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,000
It's like, there's great shows, like Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is funny.

948
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,000
I just didn't have time to really watch past season two, but one of these days I'll finish.

949
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Anyway, let's talk about a device you can watch all these shows on.

950
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,000
The PlayStation 4 Pro. You can even play games.

951
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
The PlayStation 4 Pro has hit a big milestone.

952
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,000
They have sold more than 500 million units worldwide.

953
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:13,000
And to celebrate, Sony is going to release a limited edition PlayStation 4 Pro.

954
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
It's the 500 million limited edition Pro.

955
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
They're only going to make 50,000 of these.

956
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:23,000
So you do the math on what percentage of the pros out there will be this.

957
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:29,000
But anyway, they're going to be numbered as well, so I guess that kind of makes it even more, I guess, desirable.

958
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I don't know.

959
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
What's also kind of neat about this, I mean, have you seen like the color?

960
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
It's really cool. It's like a translucent blue casing to it.

961
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
It's a really pretty looking thing.

962
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Gold lettering on it, and then a translucent blue DualShock and PlayStation Camera.

963
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
So that's pretty cool.

964
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,000
So I might be into that if I had the money to dump on something like that.

965
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:53,000
If I hadn't just bought a PlayStation 4 Pro.

966
01:29:53,000 --> 01:30:00,000
That's like when I bought my original Xbox with something like this.

967
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I got the Halo Edition Xbox that was like a translucent green.

968
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
And so it actually looked really cool.

969
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
It was translucent green, and then the controller was green as well.

970
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:15,000
So yeah, I guess they've been doing these types of things for a while, but anyway.

971
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Yeah, and they have that special, there's like two that are going to be extra special on top of that.

972
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Because of the dates that coincide with the launch of...

973
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
What did they say the extra special numbers will do?

974
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,000
They didn't say what, but it's going to have something else in there.

975
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Alright, well anyhow.

976
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:38,000
If you want to get one of these, $4.99 to pick one of these up on August 24th.

977
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,000
If you want to just get the controller, you can get that for $64.99.

978
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:47,000
And there's also going to be a limited edition gold wireless headset with the same translucent blue.

979
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:51,000
It's not part of the box set, but it's just something else available for $100.

980
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,000
If you have that kind of money to spend, enjoy.

981
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Anyhow, let's talk about Mega Man 11.

982
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:01,000
This is a game you might be playing on your PlayStation 4, or your Switch, or your Xbox.

983
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Or a variety of different platforms.

984
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Apparently, Mega Man 11 demo is supposed to come out on Xbox One on September 4th.

985
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
A demo?

986
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:16,000
A demo, which I imagine would be a similar thing, like they'll have something as well on PlayStation 4.

987
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,000
They're doing console exclusives for demos now.

988
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Yeah, I don't know.

989
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:26,000
In the demo, according to the description, take on all kinds of enemies and traps in the block band stage.

990
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:32,000
And use the new double gear system to slow down time or power up your shots and take down that boss.

991
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
So it sounds like you'll be able to play a stage from the game.

992
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
This is a throwback to Xbox 360.

993
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Remember back in the Xbox 360 days when all those games had to have demos?

994
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
All the Xbox Live Arcade games had to have demos?

995
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:48,000
So I think because of that, if memory serves me right, Mega Man 9 had to have a demo.

996
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Because it was on Xbox Arcade.

997
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Because I feel like there was a demo where you could play one stage in Mega Man 9.

998
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Yeah, they all have trial versions.

999
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Yeah, so that's probably a similar deal here.

1000
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
And Bobby Blackwell confirming he remembers there was one for Mega Man 9.

1001
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
And Dark Tetsuya said, yep, I remember when it had one stage.

1002
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
So this will probably be similar.

1003
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:15,000
And I would imagine Block Man is not the stage you're supposed to play first.

1004
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
So it's going to be challenging.

1005
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Because, you know, every Mega Man game has its boss order, right?

1006
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,000
I imagine Block Man is not the first boss you're supposed to beat in Mega Man 11.

1007
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
So it's going to be even.

1008
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Wouldn't that be a twist?

1009
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Anyway, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some full versions you can buy very soon.

1010
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Starting with the US, Loki.

1011
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Yep, this week we're getting Death's Gambit on PC and Playstation 4.

1012
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Tanglewood on PC, Mac, and Linux.

1013
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:51,000
We've got The Walking Dead, the final season, episode 1 on PC, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.

1014
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:56,000
World of Warcraft, Battle for Azeroth on PC and Mac.

1015
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,000
And Penguin Wars on Nintendo Switch.

1016
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:08,000
And State of Mind on PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.

1017
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:14,000
And we're only one week away from All Star Fruit Racing for Nintendo Switch.

1018
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Oh boy.

1019
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
But that's for next, that's the week after, so.

1020
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Alright.

1021
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Let's travel to Japan and then of course while Jamie's gone maybe you could fill in on the UK dates hopefully.

1022
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Alright, cool.

1023
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:33,000
So let's travel to Japan real quick where I actually, I don't really see a lot on Playstation 4 this week in Japan.

1024
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Because the next set of releases I see are all the way out in the 20s.

1025
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
So I guess that's it.

1026
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
I don't know if there's something going on in Japan this week, but Playstation 4 doesn't have anything.

1027
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Let me check and see if there's something on the Switch that is the reason why it's causing everything to be held up.

1028
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
No, is there a holiday out there or something?

1029
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
I don't know.

1030
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Yeah, it's an empty week in Japan.

1031
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,000
There's nothing on Playstation 4, there's nothing on Nintendo Switch, and nothing on Nintendo 3DS.

1032
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Although there will be, there are more Yokai Watch Blasters games due on the 3DS eventually.

1033
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:11,000
So, you know, there's still stuff coming to 3DS.

1034
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Well there's that WarioWare game that came out recently too.

1035
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Yeah, I hear that's pretty crazy.

1036
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Yeah, so anyway, pretty bleak week in Japan.

1037
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
How about the UK?

1038
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:25,000
UK, we've got a World of Warcraft, Battle for Azeroth, Collector's Edition, and Dead Cells,

1039
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:31,000
which is going to be coming out on Playstation 4, and Switch, and of course World of Warcraft on PC and Mac.

1040
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
And that is it.

1041
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Alright, let's get to the mailbag.

1042
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Every week you guys email us, participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com

1043
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Unless you don't, in which case last week we learned you all got a punishment.

1044
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Last week.

1045
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:59,000
But we actually got, I think the punishment worked, because we got a lot of emails this week.

1046
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:06,000
But it's kind of funny what some of these say though, we'll get into it.

1047
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
So we actually have several emails to get into tonight.

1048
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,000
With Dark Sakura not here, of course I'll be taking over emails for a little bit.

1049
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
So Robert M. starts us off tonight saying,

1050
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:20,000
I'm still enjoying the Switch port of Fortnite Battle Royale, but haven't yet invested in a battle pass.

1051
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,000
My brother's 13 year old son has generally fallen off shooters,

1052
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:29,000
but interestingly, his 5 year old son plays it on my console when I bring it over, or he's at my house.

1053
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
5 years old playing Fortnite? I can't even imagine.

1054
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,000
But I guess then again, I was playing games on the Commodore 64 at like 6 or 7, so.

1055
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:43,000
My kid's not playing Fortnite. I haven't thought about downloading it, but he's playing Octodad.

1056
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,000
He's been like, just tons of Octodad.

1057
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:51,000
My brother himself gave the game a try and confessed it was his type of game,

1058
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,000
although his busy lifestyle doesn't give him much time for gaming, what with his job and two sons.

1059
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:59,000
If either tried to join me via mobile, would it necessarily work?

1060
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,000
I do know the console says, play with same console on screen.

1061
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Would that change if I had a friends list populated by players with an Epic account on mobile, PC, or Xbox One?

1062
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Also, is there any chance of the success of Battle Royale bringing the save the world PvE to the Switch?

1063
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:19,000
I would say as far as your second question goes, I mean, anything's possible,

1064
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:24,000
especially when money does a lot of talking, so I would think with as well as that game's doing on Switch,

1065
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:29,000
I would think, sure, why wouldn't they bring the save the world PvE to that as well?

1066
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:34,000
I don't play enough Fortnite to really be able to answer your first question. I'd have to defer to chat.

1067
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:38,000
I think that it would be cross-play, as long as you're not on PlayStation, of course,

1068
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
because they don't play nice with anyone.

1069
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Yeah, he says he doesn't have anyone on his friends list that's mobile, PC, or Xbox One,

1070
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,000
so maybe you have to add some people there through the Epic Games website or through the app?

1071
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Yeah, I don't know about that.

1072
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,000
I would try doing that, add some people through the app, and then see...

1073
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
But it's supposed to be everything.

1074
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Yeah, it is supposed to work.

1075
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Unless you're a PlayStation, because fuck everybody if you're on PlayStation.

1076
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
PlayStation's on an island all by themselves.

1077
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
All right, thanks for the email.

1078
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Next email from Redertainment, who says,

1079
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Dear Jamie, if it's not too much trouble, and I don't mean to pry or demand,

1080
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,000
but I'd like to hear more stories from the Leatherbar. Thank you.

1081
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Stay care, Redertainment.

1082
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Well, joke's on you. She's not here to tell the stories, but maybe with some radio magic,

1083
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,000
I can pre-record some stories. She loves that.

1084
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Some stories in advance for when we need punishment in future weeks due to lack of emails.

1085
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,000
It kind of seems weird that we're talking about punishment and Leatherbar at the same time.

1086
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
This is going in a whole weird BDSM.

1087
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I'll tell you what, though, if we go like four weeks in a row with no emails,

1088
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I'm going to tell you about when I went to Chicago and went to a bar called Jackhammer.

1089
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
That's all I'm going to say.

1090
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,000
It was shocking. It was shocking.

1091
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
What's that? You remember that?

1092
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:04,000
I was going to say, you remember that movie, Bruno? Well, you know.

1093
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,000
No, I never saw it. I didn't want to see that movie because I was just afraid it was going to piss me off.

1094
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Anyway, let's move on and talk about the next email. The next email is from Brandon.

1095
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Hi, Brandon.

1096
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Hi, OLR. I love the show and have listened for about 10 years.

1097
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:26,000
That is an awesome accomplishment. Thanks, Brandon.

1098
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I cannot express the happiness and comfort you all have brought me during this time.

1099
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:36,000
You all have been with me through health scares, family issues, and huge social movements.

1100
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:40,000
College, moving, first job, etc. during this time.

1101
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
I wish I could express my gratitude beyond an email.

1102
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:47,000
I'm so happy you are still podcasting after so many podcasts have dropped off.

1103
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Thanks for all you do. And that's from Brandon.

1104
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,000
And there's no questions or anything in there. It's just a nice note.

1105
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Well, that's nice.

1106
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Yeah, I know. I can't tell you how much that shit means.

1107
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Exactly. I'm glad that somebody cares about this shit.

1108
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,000
I shouldn't call it shit. But I can't tell you how much it means. Like, really.

1109
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Like, especially, you know, here's the thing, guys.

1110
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Even though you say in your email, you've all been with me through health scares, family issues, and huge social movements.

1111
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Something to think about, you've been there for me through all those same things.

1112
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
And with Loki and with Dark Sakura.

1113
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Like, y'all know I had a fucking terrible year last year.

1114
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:27,000
And if you were listening to OLR last year, you know what a crap year I had last year.

1115
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:40,000
But this show was, honestly, the first couple weekends, like, this show was the reason I, like, got out of my room or got out of my bed.

1116
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:50,000
It's like that constant thing that I have that I feel like my social obligation I have to do on Sunday. You know what I mean?

1117
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
And technically I don't have to do it.

1118
01:39:53,000 --> 01:40:01,000
But I didn't want to let you guys down. I wanted to be here. I wanted to do something to take my mind off of everything else that was going on.

1119
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,000
And, you know, I say me, but I know Loki's been in similar situations as has Dark Sakura.

1120
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
And, you know, you guys have been there for me.

1121
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,000
So, Brandon, it works both ways. It really does.

1122
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,000
And so when I hear somebody who's been there for, like, ten years, I'm so fucking impressed.

1123
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
And I'm so, like, honored and thanked.

1124
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Honestly, somebody survived through ten minutes of this episode, I'm thankful and I'm honored.

1125
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Yeah.

1126
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Especially after Loki shattered all your speakers in part A.

1127
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Ah, they're used to it by now.

1128
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Alright. And thank you. You guys are talking some nice things in chat.

1129
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:35,000
She-Hulk says, thank you for doing the podcast. You do an excellent job.

1130
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Well, you know what? You guys do an excellent job of providing commentary in our chat.

1131
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,000
And, honestly, live fact-checking. You guys are really good at it.

1132
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,000
In fact, sometimes it pisses me off how good you guys are. No, I'm kidding.

1133
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Dungeon Buster says, thanks for spending your Sundays with us.

1134
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Well, thanks for spending your Sundays with us.

1135
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Aw, group hug. Bring it in.

1136
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Alright. Let's go into this last email tonight, which comes from...

1137
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,000
It's not signed, so I'll just say Jamie.

1138
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Not to be confused with our Jamie. It's a different Jamie.

1139
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Jamie says, just wanted to say that I really appreciate that you have a decently long show.

1140
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
You make the work shift fly by.

1141
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:18,000
But it got me wondering, is there some way to track back to some of your older episodes?

1142
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Like an archive I can dig around in.

1143
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:25,000
I'd actually be curious to listen to the first episode of OLR.

1144
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
That does exist.

1145
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Technically, it's not something we officially endorse.

1146
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,000
But it's one of those things where I think it's cool that it exists.

1147
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:39,000
But I'm gonna tell you why we don't officially try to direct you to find the first episode of OLR.

1148
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Because it was a very different show back then.

1149
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,000
It took us a long time to get the polish.

1150
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,000
And even now, do we really have that much of a polish?

1151
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,000
But you go to those first few episodes of OLR, they can be a little rough.

1152
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:59,000
And it's also tricky to distribute those episodes because we played music a lot during the show.

1153
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Because it wasn't podcast back then. That's kind of like what you did.

1154
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
We tried to make a morning show but on Sunday nights type of thing.

1155
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Where we'd have a little segment, do some music, come back to a segment, do some music.

1156
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:15,000
And because our show was so influenced by music-based games, we always had music to play.

1157
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,000
We were playing the latest DDR music and all that stuff.

1158
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:24,000
So I warn you, if you go chasing those old episodes down and they're out there,

1159
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,000
just expect that it's gonna be a very different show.

1160
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
And here's the other thing.

1161
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Because this is what people do in the year 2018.

1162
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:38,000
I'm not gonna take responsibility for some of the things that have been said on those earlier episodes.

1163
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Oh god, yes.

1164
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Because here's the thing.

1165
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,000
This show has existed for 15 years.

1166
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:50,000
And there are probably things I've said on this show, and Loki said on this show, and Jamie said on this show even,

1167
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
15 years ago, that probably wouldn't be okay to say now.

1168
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Of course, I tried to say things that were the most offensive things I could think of at the time.

1169
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:05,000
So, if you are trying to dig up old episodes to use that shit against us now, like, fucking don't.

1170
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,000
First off, no one's gonna give a shit because they're like, who?

1171
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Yeah, exactly, who?

1172
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:18,000
But at the same time, I would not be surprised at all if I heard a phrase on television, on Project Runway,

1173
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:22,000
like, hot tea dash dash dash mess.

1174
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:26,000
I probably would've used that phrase here on the show because I loved Project Runway at the time.

1175
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:32,000
I wouldn't use that phrase now because I realize that that is, like, I've come a long way and I've learned

1176
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
that that word is very offensive and holds a lot of weight to some people.

1177
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:38,000
And I don't wanna offend those people.

1178
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,000
So, that's all I'm gonna say, again, as well as to digging up old shit.

1179
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Because that seems to be the thing to do now to people is dig up the fucking archives from such and such day

1180
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
and find the dirt.

1181
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:54,000
And I imagine, look, I'm not saying this as an excuse to yell at you, Jamie,

1182
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:59,000
because I'm sure your intentions are very pure and very good and I really appreciate that,

1183
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
but I just kinda wanna get that out there.

1184
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:08,000
If y'all are gonna seek out back episodes, we probably said some shit on those episodes that we regret saying.

1185
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:15,000
So, please do not come at me with, why did you say such XYZ thing on episode five and six?

1186
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Because we were stupid then and we're stupid now and still learning every day,

1187
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:25,000
but we're trying to do better with every day as I think most decent people are.

1188
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
So, anyhow, there you go.

1189
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:34,000
SSJ100Matt says, the first hundred episodes of OLR were very different, but the same humor and fun is still there.

1190
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Yeah, I think it was 138 was the magic number.

1191
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Was 138 when the podcast and the live show got married?

1192
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
I don't remember.

1193
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Because for those who don't know the history of OLR-

1194
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
It's probably on the wiki.

1195
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
It is on the wiki.

1196
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Well, I'm hoping Dark Dead Studio probably just knows.

1197
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Yeah, Dark Dead Studio, 170.

1198
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Okay, thank you.

1199
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:57,000
I think 130 was when we started doing the podcast concurrently with the live show.

1200
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
It was around that number, like 131 or 132.

1201
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Because for those who don't know the history of OLR, we were a live show dedicated to music games.

1202
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:11,000
And then when we found out about podcasting, we were like, well, let's do like this OLR to go edition that's going to be about all video games.

1203
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Yeah, because podcasts were like-

1204
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Was brand new.

1205
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Ten minutes, like-

1206
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Yeah, it was like 10, 20 minutes, you know, and that was, it was like, and so it started like this 20 minute side podcast and then it grew and grew and then fucking iTunes got podcasting.

1207
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:33,000
We were on it and that's when our show kind of exploded and we've never been that big ever since.

1208
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:37,000
But then it was like our to go edition started to become like an hour long.

1209
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Then there was a point where we kind of sat there and went, okay, so we have our three hour live show we're doing that has maybe 2% of the listeners right now that we have an iTunes on our to go edition.

1210
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:57,000
And right now there ain't a whole lot happening in music gaming because Konami wasn't making new music games at the time.

1211
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Guitar Hero had not quite yet broken through yet, so it was in that weird low.

1212
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:09,000
So we just made a decision. We were like, you know what, we're going to take our old format and our new content and make that one show.

1213
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
And that was the show you hear now.

1214
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:22,000
So that OLR started, I guess it started to, has it marked episode 170 was kind of the first of the modern OLR, I suppose.

1215
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:33,000
But I still think the years before it count, which is why I say we've been doing what we've been doing for 16 years and why there are really not a lot of shows that are able to get very close to that.

1216
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Because we did kind of have the jump by having a live show for as long as we did before podcasting was even a thing.

1217
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:43,000
So, anyway, um, yeah.

1218
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Dark Tetsuya says, of course, the very first week we did the podcast, they went and announced DDR Supernova.

1219
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Yeah, I'd like to think that was just really just so that Jason Enos could get at us.

1220
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
No, I'm just kidding. I'm making that up.

1221
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Obviously that came from, uh, actually it was really cool because we got to go to that Konami event where they unveiled Supernova.

1222
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:02,000
You were like the second person in the US to play DDR Supernova.

1223
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Oh yeah, I did. I had Naoki watching me.

1224
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Yeah, that was awesome. Anyway.

1225
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Cause everyone was like, cause I think they were doing, everyone was like playing Metal Gear Solid 3.

1226
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Yeah, cause all these other games were announced.

1227
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,000
I'm like, fuck that shit. I'm all over Supernova. I don't give a shit about your fuck.

1228
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Well, they had also BeatMania. That was the home version of BeatMania that came over. BeatMania US.

1229
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:27,000
But I was like, fuck that shit. I don't give a shit about that. I'm playing Supernova cause I want to play that.

1230
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Uh, Raginator in chat says, OLR so old that the host can't remember how goddamn old the show is.

1231
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,000
You're right. Cause YYR keeps saying it's 16 years by the way, not 15.

1232
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:45,000
You're right. I should know better. 15 is a rounder number for some reason. I keep saying 15. 15 plus. 15 plus. Fourth mix plus.

1233
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Um, and then uh, here's the link. If you really want to get to the old shows.

1234
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Dark Tetsuya has an archive up. It's over at bit.ly, like the little URL shortener, slash OLR chive.

1235
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:06,000
It's supposed to be OLR archive, but it reads like OLR chive. So there it is.

1236
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:13,000
But again, please remember all those disclaimers I gave you about the old content. It is old content.

1237
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:18,000
All right. That wasn't all of Jamie's email though. Sorry. We derailed halfway through that happens sometimes.

1238
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Um, so the second part of the email goes, Oh, and by the way, I'm not sure about the other listeners, but you can go ahead and pretend that you didn't get any emails again.

1239
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:35,000
I almost didn't send this one because Jamie's so-called punishment stories are a kick. Ha ha.

1240
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:43,000
He all better be careful because maybe next year we'll just get rid of classic game of the week and we'll just have Jamie's story time of the week.

1241
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:48,000
All right. Thank you so much for the email, Jamie. And thank you everybody for the emails. I really appreciate that.

1242
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:53,000
And you guys know that there's always going to be random stories of some sort here on the show.

1243
01:48:53,000 --> 01:49:01,000
I just, I just really like to get emails. You guys, I'm also curious because this question kind of came up offline.

1244
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Is there like another way you guys would want to interact with us? Like, because here's the thing.

1245
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:12,000
And I know it's a weird question, but like, I also kind of also realize that email is getting a little more and more dated.

1246
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Like, I feel like people aren't using email as much as they are like Facebook messenger.

1247
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Right? Like I don't, I don't email Alan when I need to get his attention. I send him a message on Google Hangouts.

1248
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Or I text a friend or I use Facebook Messenger for some people. It's kind of weird because like I jump on this platform.

1249
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:36,000
It's called Google Plus. We're there. Did you know ORLR has a Google Plus page?

1250
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Don't you remember the foogle question of the week, you old man? Man, we're on the same platform as Infowars.

1251
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Ah, fuck off. Alright, anyway. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, we use all dated stuff here.

1252
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:57,000
IRC, dated. Email, dated. Shoutcast, dated. Forums, dated. But now dated. Skype, dated.

1253
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Everybody wants to get us, get a hold of us through Ello.

1254
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Sia Tabiri in chat says, I'm holding out for the Scruff profile.

1255
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:09,000
That's right. ORLR, now available on Grindr.

1256
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Be sure to swipe right and set a date with ORLR.

1257
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Alright, anyhow. Look, we're asking a lot of these same questions and Bobby says all that stuff.

1258
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:34,000
But, you know, there might be a winky face there. Anyway, let's move on and talk about some more gaming news.

1259
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:39,000
We have more stories to get to. And then our ancient fucking Skype line at Orange Laundry.

1260
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Which, I don't, why is everybody saying Skype is dated?

1261
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Like, I talked to you guys, like, a couple months ago about how I was playing one of those online Facebook survivor-y type of games, right?

1262
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Because, like, it was my mystery project I was working on for a little while.

1263
01:50:53,000 --> 01:51:00,000
And it all fucking uses Skype. And the people that played that game and the communities, they all still use Skype.

1264
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
I'm in, like, all these group Skype chats.

1265
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:10,000
So, what is the new, if it's dated, then what is the current way? Is it supposed to be through, you know...

1266
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Many shows, especially in the gaming community, are using Discord in this day and age.

1267
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:23,000
So, what'll happen is that you'll set up a channel and if somebody wants to call in, quote unquote, they go to a special channel on Discord.

1268
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:28,000
And you can, like, pull that person into, like, your live call room and you talk to them through Discord.

1269
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:35,000
And I don't, but here's, so, like, I would assume some of the advantages of that is you don't have to add anybody to a contact list.

1270
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:41,000
It's open, it's public, it's easy to get to. You can do it on your mobile phone or you can do it on your desktop.

1271
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
But you can do Skype on your mobile phone or your desktop.

1272
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:48,000
So, that's why I always kind of like Skype, was that, and why I've kind of shifted to what you'll notice.

1273
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
I don't even give out a phone number anymore, because who uses that anymore?

1274
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Plus, Skype is on some game consoles, whereas Discord is not on game consoles.

1275
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:00,000
It is, it is. But I don't know, but for some reason, that's what the kids today are using, is Discord.

1276
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:07,000
So, it's interesting, anyway. Also, to an extent, Google Hangouts, I think, still.

1277
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:14,000
To an extent. I think it's a little harder to arrange your live calls through there, but I remember a time when Skype was down for an extended period,

1278
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,000
that we were looking at doing Google Hangouts as, like, a stopgap.

1279
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:24,000
So, I don't know. But anyway, our ancient fucking Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio coming up after some more news.

1280
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Lowkey, let's get back to gaming.

1281
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Let's talk about Bethesda again. Yay!

1282
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:38,000
This time, I don't know. It's not a huge deal, but Bethesda is basically threatening that they're not going to release the Elder Scrolls Legends on systems that don't allow cross-play.

1283
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:42,000
That would be probably like, you know, the PlayStation 4.

1284
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:47,000
The Elder Scrolls Legends is a strategy card game that encompasses both single and multiplayer.

1285
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:52,000
It's both cross-platform play and cross-platform progress.

1286
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:59,000
But it would only be cross-play on certain systems. It is our intention for the game to come out.

1287
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:09,000
It has to be one of those things on any system. We cannot have a game that works one way across everywhere else, except for one thing.

1288
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:16,000
And the way the game works right now on Apple, Google, Steam, and BethesdaNet, it doesn't matter where you buy the stuff.

1289
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
If you play it on another platform, the stuff is there.

1290
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:24,000
It doesn't matter on what platform you play on. You play it against anybody else who was playing it at that moment.

1291
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:29,000
There's no, oh, it's easier to control, or, oh, it has a better frame rate on the system.

1292
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:32,000
It's a strategy card game. It doesn't matter.

1293
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:40,000
So basically saying that, you know, they're talking to their platform partners, but those terms are non-negotiable.

1294
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:48,000
We can't be talking about one version of Legends where you take your progress with you and another version where it stays within that ecosystem walled off from everyone else.

1295
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
There's your shade thrown at Sony.

1296
01:53:51,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Sony is going to break on this stance. They are under so much, Sony is going to break on this stance, and they're going to do it in a very public fashion.

1297
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Probably it's going to be one of their announcements at PSX, is that they're going to announce that Fortnite will soon be like cross playable with Nintendo Switch or something.

1298
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:15,000
They're gonna, they're gonna bulge on it because there's so much public pressure going on, but they're gonna do it in a fashion where everybody can cheer and go,

1299
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:19,000
good guy Sony, and we'll all forget that they were ever the bad guy in the first place.

1300
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:23,000
I never forget. I never forget.

1301
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Do you? Alright.

1302
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Fuck you EA and your stupid online pass.

1303
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:33,000
YYR says Sony is under no pressure. Sony will do what Sony wants to do.

1304
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:37,000
YYR, have you ever read the replies to a PlayStation tweet recently?

1305
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:43,000
And look, I get Twitter is not always the most accurate representation of society. I completely understand that.

1306
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:51,000
However, I do, I do think there's a lot of loud clamoring about Sony and the thing is some of this starts to get reported on in the press.

1307
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:58,000
And then you have things like this that Bethesda is coming out and saying, if Sony doesn't change, then we're going to release everywhere.

1308
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:04,000
I think Sony's stance on this will be, and I quote them, actually, I'm going to quote Bethesda here.

1309
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:09,000
It's a strategy guard game. It doesn't matter. So they're not going to fucking care.

1310
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Sony is going to fuck themselves the exact same way Microsoft fucked themselves when Street Fighter 5 got announced as an exclusive for what?

1311
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Sony and PC. Just wait, there's going to be something like this that's going to come out and they're going to say,

1312
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Oh, it's Microsoft switch and PC and it's not coming for Sony.

1313
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:34,000
And it's going to be much bigger than a strategy guard game.

1314
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:40,000
You joke. I know it's joke. They'll come through joke.

1315
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Anyway, someday. All right.

1316
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, hell, the Sony Fortnite story made it to CNBC or Fox business during E3.

1317
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:57,000
They interviewed Reggie and asked him about Sony and Fortnite. Reggie's like, that's up to them.

1318
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:01,000
You'll have to ask them. That's very true. Fuck those guys.

1319
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Anyhow. Um, YYR says a very vocal, tiny minority does not speak as loud as the millions of dollars pouring in from loyal PlayStation gamers.

1320
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Yes and no. Again, we just reported on Bethesda or you'll discuss Bethesda is about to not release a game on a Sony platform because of this.

1321
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:30,000
And maybe it's, Oh well, it's a card game this time, but what developer is it going to be next time?

1322
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:37,000
I remember they have other games other than card games. They have like the other scroll six or whatever the other game there.

1323
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:42,000
But this it's there's Skyrim again. I'm just, this is what I'm saying.

1324
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:51,000
History will repeat itself except this time it's going to be Sony and not Microsoft.

1325
01:56:51,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Just like when the PlayStation three was first announced and it was Sony and not migrant like the history will repeat itself.

1326
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:09,000
I guarantee it. All right. Anyhow, let's move on.

1327
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Let's talk about torchlight. Why not? We talked about Diablo earlier in the show.

1328
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Should we talk about torchlight? Well, sadly, I'm not here to talk about torchlight three, but this sounds like it might be just as awesome.

1329
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:28,000
If not more awesome torchlight frontiers has been announced. It is a shared world action RPG.

1330
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,000
And of course it's the same universe as torchlight one and two.

1331
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:38,000
So this time the reason why they're calling it a different thing is because it is a shared persistent dynamically generated world.

1332
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:42,000
So players and their pets will hack and slack their way through the game.

1333
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:48,000
There'll be ancient ruins of lost civilizations and of course, loot, loot, loot more to come at a later date.

1334
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Of course, this game is in development at extra games. Sorry if I mispronounced that.

1335
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Runic Games and Blizzard North co-founder Max Schaeffer is behind extra games leading this.

1336
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:04,000
And a lot of the team is folks that have worked on Diablo previously and torchlight.

1337
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
That's why a lot of people love torchlight.

1338
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Gamescom 2018 and PAX West will be the first time to get your hands on it.

1339
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
So I'm guessing that's when more information will be out.

1340
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,000
One more quote here from Max Schaeffer who says,

1341
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Evolving the torchlight universe into a shared world has always been a goal for the franchise.

1342
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
I'm excited that we're finally able to make it a reality.

1343
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Torchlight frontiers will be a living, breathing universe that will still feel uniquely torchlight with our own creative spin.

1344
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:34,000
The team is building something truly special and we can't wait for fans to play it for the first time at Gamescom and PAX West.

1345
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:38,000
It will be available on PC, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.

1346
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Well, I guess we know that persistent world won't be shared between all those platforms.

1347
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:48,000
But actually, I kind of dig the idea of like a one world, one persistent world type of thing.

1348
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
That's going to be very interesting in a Diablo-esque type of game.

1349
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:53,000
So I'm kind of curious how that's going to pan out.

1350
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
And the torchlight games are really good.

1351
01:58:55,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Like, you know, torchlight 2 was a good, especially because torchlight 2 and Diablo 3 kind of came out around the same time.

1352
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:05,000
And it was like Diablo 3 when it first came out was a bit, bit turdy.

1353
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:10,000
So torchlight 2 is a really good kind of like thing to play while they were making Diablo 3 better.

1354
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,000
And then by the time you kind of wore out torchlight 2, it was like, oh, Diablo 3 is better again.

1355
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:16,000
So, yeah, I'd be very interested to see where this goes.

1356
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
So I kind of like that they're doing something a little different with it.

1357
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
So I'll be checking out torchlight frontiers.

1358
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:26,000
I hope those of you that are going to one of these conventions that we name check there will get to check that out as well.

1359
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Loki.

1360
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,000
All right.

1361
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:34,000
And then let's talk a little bit about Germany and what Germany can now do.

1362
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:43,000
So it used to be that any sort of Nazi imagery in games in Germany would have to be censored.

1363
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Well, now after pressure, I guess, from the German Games Industry Association, the government has relaxed their laws regarding that in certain circumstances.

1364
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:04,000
So now, long story short, they can go ahead and show Nazi imagery in video games again.

1365
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:08,000
So it doesn't have to be censored in the new Wolfenstein game, for example.

1366
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Well, I'm not particularly one to celebrate this news.

1367
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:19,000
However, I understand if we don't learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it.

1368
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:27,000
So from a, I suppose, educational and historical accuracy type of, you know, place.

1369
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
So I get it.

1370
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Yeah.

1371
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:35,000
So that's where that symbol needs to stay.

1372
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
I want to make that very clear, too.

1373
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Right.

1374
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Yeah.

1375
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,000
All right.

1376
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Let's talk about Facebook and AR gaming on Facebook.

1377
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Now, I know when I say AR games, you might think about stuff like Pokemon Go, because it kind of like it sort of has like the AR mode in there, although I never use it.

1378
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:58,000
The only time I've ever used the AR thing on Pokemon Go is when you have to use it to get Mew.

1379
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Oh, you have to?

1380
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Yeah.

1381
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
But it's not as bad as it sounds.

1382
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
It's just part of like the little magic.

1383
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
But it's very like Mew.

1384
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Spoiler alert.

1385
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Mew is a guaranteed catch on the third ball.

1386
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
You throw the first ball, it shakes once.

1387
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Throw the second ball, it shakes twice.

1388
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Third ball, you're always going to catch it.

1389
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:18,000
So it's just, it's just a cute little thing to do.

1390
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Yeah, I don't play with the augmented reality part on because that's just like...

1391
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,000
No, it'll turn it on.

1392
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,000
It'll turn it on.

1393
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
I know, I know.

1394
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:28,000
You have to have a phone that doesn't support it at all to have Mew be a regular catch.

1395
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Because it's just like, it's like, hey, it's battery drain mode, you know?

1396
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,000
No, thanks.

1397
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Yeah.

1398
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Well, anyway, Facebook, because, you know, Facebook really wants to get into gaming.

1399
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Somehow, or it seems like, I swear to God, I feel like every six months on this show

1400
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:45,000
we're like, here's how Facebook plans to get into gaming and then nothing.

1401
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Whatever happened to the competitive Pac-Man and messaging and stuff?

1402
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
They have it, but no one gives a shit about it.

1403
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Yeah, I know, right?

1404
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Anyway.

1405
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Because every time everybody thinks about Facebook, they think about, oh, hey, they're

1406
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
stealing our data.

1407
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:58,000
That's true.

1408
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Anyway, or, oh, hey, that's where grandma posts all her racist shit.

1409
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,000
It's on Facebook, right?

1410
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Anyway.

1411
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Pretty soon it's going to have to be Google Plus.

1412
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Anyway, going over to AR gaming in Messenger.

1413
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:16,000
That's where Messenger's going to be doing AR gaming in video chats on the mobile apps.

1414
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:21,000
So six people can play these simple competitive games and you can use your face.

1415
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:26,000
You use the little star button to pick a game and that will let you play.

1416
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:32,000
So some games you can play feature such soon to be classics as Asteroids Attack,

1417
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:37,000
where you steer a spaceship around obstacles with your nose.

1418
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:45,000
There's another game called Don't Smile, which it's a fucking staring contest.

1419
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:48,000
It is a fucking staring contest as an AR game.

1420
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:53,000
So I actually think these games sound so ridiculous.

1421
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Don't Smile is what I'm going to be doing when I get a request for somebody to play.

1422
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Don't Smile.

1423
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Like, fuck off, you know. No.

1424
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Don't Smile is what I think about when somebody wants to play an AR Facebook game with me.

1425
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:11,000
No, but these sound so ridiculous.

1426
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,000
I almost want to do a live stream of playing these ridiculous ass games.

1427
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Let's see, there are also, there's more future editions coming soon.

1428
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Beach Bump, where you bounce a ball between players.

1429
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:27,000
And lastly, but not leastly, Kitten Craze, where you match cats.

1430
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:30,000
I don't know how you do that with your face, but I'm told you match cats.

1431
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
It's a kitty matching game.

1432
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Anyhow, this is all part of Facebook's strategy to keep you involved using the Messenger app,

1433
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:41,000
because, as we just mentioned earlier, people are using Messenger where, you know,

1434
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:44,000
email was what was used before, but now people are looking at other things,

1435
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:48,000
like Discord, like Skype, like Slack, whatever.

1436
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:53,000
So anyway, yeah, I guess there might be some people that are into this.

1437
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:56,000
You know, if you're like 14, I guess this stuff would be hilarious,

1438
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,000
but I don't think I'll be using it anytime soon.

1439
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Yeah, that's going to be a no for me.

1440
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
A no for me, dog.

1441
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Is anyone out there in our chat going to play Don't Smile?

1442
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Or, you know what Don't Smile is?

1443
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:17,000
It's a way for the government to watch you using your video camera.

1444
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
That's what Don't Smile is.

1445
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Don't smile. The president is watching you.

1446
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:29,000
All right. YYR in chat says, nah, I'd lose right away.

1447
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Yeah, with certain people, the minute their face comes on screen, it's going to happen.

1448
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Just come up on the screen smiling, oh, damn, I lost, bye.

1449
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Hang on.

1450
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
All right, a few more stories for you, Loki.

1451
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:45,000
So Discord is going to be launching their own curated game store.

1452
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
I wondered how they were going to make money.

1453
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Haven't you wondered that?

1454
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Haven't you sat there wondering, how is Discord going to make money?

1455
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Like, everybody is using, like, there's tons of things on Discord right now,

1456
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:59,000
which, by the way, guys, don't forget, you can go to vognetwork.com slash Discord

1457
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
and join the official VOG Network Discord.

1458
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:08,000
So anyways, there's a new tab, I guess it's called Games,

1459
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
or Store or something like that,

1460
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
and basically they're going to offer games on there,

1461
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:15,000
and they even have a program which is a first on Discord program,

1462
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:21,000
which funds any game developers in exchange for temporary exclusives.

1463
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Exclusivity window usually lasts 90 days,

1464
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:30,000
and there'll be some new universal library that will scan for games on your machine

1465
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:34,000
and, I guess, boot the launchers for those games.

1466
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:43,000
You know, I have to say, the first on Discord thing reminds me a lot of the Ouya.

1467
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Because they had a similar program as well.

1468
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,000
They did.

1469
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,000
They did.

1470
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
It was the first on Ouya, and...

1471
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Ouya, that wasn't very good.

1472
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Ouya!

1473
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Ouya? Oh yeah!

1474
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:03,000
What do you think about the whole, like, Discord game store as a whole, though?

1475
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Do you think it's something that could really give Steam a run for its money?

1476
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:08,000
I mean, I guess it's early to be thinking things like that, but...

1477
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:12,000
I don't know, I did notice that they switched it so that when you boot up the app,

1478
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
which many people have when they boot up their computer,

1479
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:18,000
now it starts showing you, like, gaming news by default.

1480
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:21,000
And it's kind of targeted at, like, the games that you play.

1481
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:27,000
So, like, I'll see gaming news, I'll see the common games that I play,

1482
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:28,000
like a quick launch bar.

1483
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:32,000
I'm gonna tell you right now, this is a good thing for indie gamers,

1484
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:37,000
or indie games, because I can put my game on Steam,

1485
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:41,000
where it's gonna get hidden in that pile of garbage,

1486
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:44,000
or I can put my game on this service that hardly has anything on it,

1487
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
and it's gonna get more views on it.

1488
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Interesting.

1489
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
So I think that's where they have an advantage there.

1490
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Well, I just, I think Discord kind of backdoor their store into so many computers

1491
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,000
by launching this as a free chat.

1492
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:01,000
I mean, so many people, because Discord is basically doing what Slack was doing,

1493
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:05,000
but not charging anybody for it, and it has, like, all that voice chat built in.

1494
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:09,000
So, so many people are going to Discord, and as we've seen in the media,

1495
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
and I don't want to get too far down this rabbit hole,

1496
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:15,000
but even certain non-gaming things have started using Discord,

1497
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
and some of them have been extremely controversial,

1498
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:21,000
and Discord has rightly, you know, put the smackdown on many of those,

1499
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:25,000
like, crappy things that were there, because I guess it would be kind of hard

1500
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:28,000
for Discord to police what is gaming and what is not gaming.

1501
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,000
You know what I mean?

1502
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Yeah.

1503
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:34,000
So, but anyway, but now, I guess Discord, to its credit,

1504
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:39,000
by backdooring this whole store into, so Discord was kind of like a Trojan horse

1505
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,000
this whole time, in a way.

1506
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:43,000
It wheeled its way into your computer as a free chat service,

1507
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:46,000
and now, ta-da, it's a store, and gaming news and all this,

1508
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:52,000
but with it being now a branded gaming store, and gaming news, and all this stuff,

1509
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:56,000
now it's very much a gaming service, and hopefully is less attractive

1510
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:00,000
for things that have nothing to do with gaming that shouldn't be on Discord,

1511
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
or anywhere, for that matter.

1512
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
So, anyway.

1513
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Rama in chat says,

1514
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Slack is more for businesses than it is for games.

1515
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Yeah, it is, but I think about, like, you know, like, Ingressors,

1516
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:16,000
I know, use Slack a lot, and I'm sure there's other,

1517
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:20,000
I've seen certain other gaming communities use Slack.

1518
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:24,000
I know, like, certain development communities,

1519
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
which I guess is kind of business, have used Slack.

1520
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:29,000
A lot of these things were kind of built before Discord.

1521
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:33,000
So, I mean, there are gaming communities that have used Slack.

1522
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:36,000
There was a hot minute where we were looking at Slack for VOG Network,

1523
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:40,000
but it was, like, literally five seconds later, Discord came out,

1524
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
and you know what the key difference was?

1525
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Well, besides cost. That's a big one.

1526
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:50,000
The key difference was that with Slack, you have to invite people to it,

1527
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:55,000
and that's, like, making people ask for an invite is going to turn away

1528
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:58,000
so many people that are not going to bother to ask for an invite.

1529
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:01,000
But with Discord, you can leave the front door open and say,

1530
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
come on in, party's over here.

1531
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:06,000
So when I say go to vognetwork.com slash Discord,

1532
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,000
that's exactly what you're doing.

1533
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
You're just going to the front door and walking on in

1534
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
because you're able to do, like, an open invite.

1535
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:15,000
And the fact that it's free is also kind of another big, big, big, you know,

1536
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
selling point on that.

1537
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:22,000
But, you know, I get that Slack is also used in a lot of business type of situations.

1538
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,000
So, hmm. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

1539
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:29,000
yeah, I live on Slack on the weekdays and Discord on the weekends.

1540
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Anyway. All right.

1541
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
One more story for you guys,

1542
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:37,000
and I think many of you guys have seen this floating around the internet.

1543
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Have you seen this kind of like this meme that's out there,

1544
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:46,000
this story about the man on the bike, the 70-year-old man, Chen San Wan,

1545
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:49,000
old man who lives in Taiwan. He's 70 years old.

1546
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:53,000
He has a rig hooked up to his bicycle

1547
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:57,000
where he plays nine phones at a time.

1548
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:00,000
I guess apparently, though, there is a setup that would allow for 11,

1549
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
but he basically has them all strapped to his bike,

1550
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:05,000
and you can see this in the little, I guess there's like a news thing

1551
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:09,000
that's floating around that you can see this in him playing the game.

1552
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:13,000
There's a battery that powers all these phones on the bike, of course,

1553
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:17,000
that will provide power to all these phones up to 20 hours.

1554
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:20,000
And I'm thinking, like, everybody's seen this guy in their town.

1555
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
I don't know about you at Pokémon Go raids,

1556
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:26,000
but I've seen this person that brings, it's not on a bike,

1557
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:29,000
but a fucking clipboard or a board with,

1558
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:33,000
and I think the most number of phones I've seen on a board is seven.

1559
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:37,000
I've seen somebody bring seven phones on a board to a raid where it's like,

1560
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:41,000
they could do this raid by themselves with all of their phones,

1561
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:45,000
but it's easier to do it with other people or whatever,

1562
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
or sometimes, you know, especially because,

1563
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:50,000
but I was like, how do you tap all those phones at once?

1564
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,000
And they actually showed me.

1565
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:55,000
If you face the phones, like, one upside down and one next to you,

1566
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
so the ball button is at the bottom,

1567
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
or it's just at the top in one place and at the bottom in another,

1568
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:03,000
then you spread your fingers out like this,

1569
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
and you go up and down the screen.

1570
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
You tap, tap, tap, tap.

1571
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:08,000
You go up and down your clipboard.

1572
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
You tap each one once really fast,

1573
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:13,000
and that's how you battle with like six or seven at once.

1574
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Isn't that crazy?

1575
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:19,000
This is totally violating the, you know, terms of service.

1576
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
I know, and like, as an Ingress player.

1577
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:22,000
Like, I get it.

1578
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Like, oh, it's so quaint that this old man, like, fuck you.

1579
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
I don't give a shit how old you are.

1580
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
You're fucking breaking the rules.

1581
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
But at the same time, like, I understand.

1582
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Like, here's the thing.

1583
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Yeah, the Ingresser in me is like, this is so wrong,

1584
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:36,000
but at the same time, I'm like, you know what?

1585
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Pokemon Go, it's a different game,

1586
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:42,000
and I just, I just, if that's how somebody wants to spend their money,

1587
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,000
spend their time, spend their life.

1588
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Better than them doing that and also, you know.

1589
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:47,000
I support.

1590
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:48,000
GPS hacking.

1591
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Yeah, I was going to say, I support that way more than I support GPS hacking.

1592
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
That's, you know what?

1593
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
If you want to ride around on a bike with 20 phones,

1594
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:00,000
at least you're out there on a bike doing it yourself,

1595
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:03,000
and you're not, like, fucking cheating from your basement.

1596
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,000
So, you know what?

1597
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
If you want a multi-account, go right ahead.

1598
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
In Pokemon Go, go right ahead.

1599
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:12,000
But if you want a multi-account in PvP games like Ingress, fuck right off.

1600
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
That's my opinion.

1601
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:15,000
Anyway.

1602
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:19,000
S2100mattinchat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

1603
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:22,000
the one guy I talked to with four phones was an older man

1604
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:25,000
who is playing on his kids' and his wife's account.

1605
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:29,000
They can't raid during the day, so on my lunch break, I play for them.

1606
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:34,000
And to be fair, there have been times where I've been,

1607
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,000
especially when it was easier to catch unknowns because of the scanners,

1608
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:43,000
I would be like, one time an unknown spawned at the old apartment complex

1609
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:46,000
where we used to tape this show before we were here.

1610
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Like, they actually spawned?

1611
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Yeah, an unknown spawned over there.

1612
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Well, this is when scanners were working, so people knew that it was there.

1613
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
So it's not that far from here, right?

1614
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Because we only moved, like, five minutes away, right?

1615
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
So we got in the car and went over there,

1616
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:02,000
and I texted one of my friends to say, this is what we're going to do.

1617
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:05,000
And my friend was like, log into my account and get it for me.

1618
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
And I was like, all right, I'll do it.

1619
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,000
So I logged out.

1620
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Once I caught it, I logged out of my Google.

1621
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:13,000
I logged into his Google and then caught it on his account, too.

1622
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:16,000
But do they actually spawn unknowns anymore, or is that just...

1623
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:19,000
They do, but because the scanners aren't available,

1624
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
they're a lot harder to pinpoint.

1625
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:24,000
People don't know where to look for them or find them.

1626
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:27,000
So they're out there, especially during special events.

1627
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
They're always out there during special events.

1628
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Yeah, I need to catch ghost-type Pokémon now.

1629
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Yeah.

1630
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:35,000
ActDeftInChat says, unknowns spawn everywhere.

1631
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:36,000
The thing is really hard to find.

1632
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
It's a bummer you didn't go to Capitol Park last week

1633
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
because it was a Duskull nest.

1634
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:41,000
So they were everywhere.

1635
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Look for a Duskull or a Mistrivo nest because those two will nest.

1636
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
I don't know if Shuppets nest.

1637
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
They might, question mark.

1638
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
But Duskull...

1639
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Gasliesel nest.

1640
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
I remember that was one of the last gen ones.

1641
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
Didn't they have, because I haven't gotten to the point yet

1642
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
where you have to evolve either a Magikarp.

1643
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
What's the other one they want?

1644
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Magikarp or...

1645
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,000
You have to catch a Ditto and evolve a Magikarp.

1646
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:06,000
I've already caught a Ditto.

1647
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Okay.

1648
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:08,000
I've already done that.

1649
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
There's no other, like, massive candy.

1650
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Okay, I wasn't sure if it was Magikarp or...

1651
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,000
No, it's only Magikarp.

1652
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:17,000
People are theorizing that in later quests

1653
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:21,000
you will have to evolve one of the other 400 candy things

1654
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:24,000
like Wailmer or the little bird, Swablu.

1655
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Yes, because I'm very close to evolving a Swablu.

1656
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Like, if I need this for, like...

1657
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,000
I know, right?

1658
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Maybe I should just hold off because it's garbage anyways, but...

1659
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Yeah.

1660
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Okay, ActDeft says, Shuppets do nest.

1661
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Oh, that's good.

1662
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:40,000
sj100mat points out they spawned, like, the Unowns at PAX East and E3.

1663
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
So I'm sure some of the people going to PAX pretty soon

1664
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
will be seeing some of those.

1665
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
By the way, I am going to open the Skype line now.

1666
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype

1667
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
while we finish our Pokemon Go chat.

1668
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.

1669
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
If you want to give us a call and talk about anything

1670
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
we haven't talked about yet or something you want to comment on.

1671
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:59,000
sj100mat says Lunatones are also a little random.

1672
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
That's one of the few things I don't have yet.

1673
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:02,000
This is fucking Lunatones.

1674
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:03,000
Those are hard to find.

1675
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Those are really hard to find.

1676
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
They spawn downtown, so, like, once in a while

1677
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
you'll see a report in Discord.

1678
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Which, usually, I'm not looking...

1679
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
I should probably join the Discord.

1680
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
I know, but, God, I'm usually...

1681
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:16,000
I'm not looking at it because there's so much there.

1682
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Like, it's just, like, it's always full.

1683
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
They're always having to prune inactive people.

1684
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
So it's, like, you know, it's, like, full bust at the seams

1685
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
of 2,000 people over on Discord.

1686
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:27,000
And it's, like, there's so much noise because of that.

1687
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:30,000
I mean, they have it split into 11 billion channels.

1688
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Like, every neighborhood in Sacramento has their own little,

1689
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:34,000
like, subgroup.

1690
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:38,000
But then what I find happens is that a lot of the subgroups

1691
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
then split off into their own thing.

1692
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:43,000
So the raiders here, instead of using Discord

1693
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
and the channel that was made for this neighborhood,

1694
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,000
they used GroupMe.

1695
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:49,000
So it's, like, I have to have Slack for Ingress.

1696
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
I have to have Discord for other games.

1697
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
I have it for, like, Pokemon Go and stuff.

1698
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
I have to have GroupMe for this.

1699
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
I have to have Telegram, because now a lot of the people

1700
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
that used to use Hangouts and Ingress,

1701
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:00,000
now they want to use Telegram.

1702
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
I have to use, like, oh, my God, my folder of, like,

1703
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:05,000
chat apps on my phone is fucking disgusting.

1704
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Anyway.

1705
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
All right, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1706
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:09,000
If you want to give us a call,

1707
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:10,000
we have a call coming in right now.

1708
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Let's get to it.

1709
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1710
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,000
Who's this?

1711
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Hey, Robert.

1712
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:15,000
It's Regenator.

1713
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Hey, Regenator.

1714
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,000
What's on your mind, buddy?

1715
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Uh, no, no, a whole lot.

1716
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Um, you know, you know, you know, a quick, you know,

1717
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:26,000
gaming-related question, assuming that there's, uh,

1718
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:30,000
time after the question, uh, quick PSA.

1719
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Okay.

1720
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Uh, subject was brought up towards the beginning of the show.

1721
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Sure was the question.

1722
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:36,000
All right.

1723
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Now, obviously, uh, everyone doesn't have infinite amount of time

1724
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
and energy to play video games,

1725
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:45,000
but we still have an interest in gaming nonetheless.

1726
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Uh-huh.

1727
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:50,000
That being said, when we don't have the time and or energy

1728
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:55,000
to play games, do you guys have, uh, an interest in, you know,

1729
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:59,000
making use of gaming-related media to kill, uh,

1730
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
kill the time, pass the time?

1731
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Uh, and if so, what is your favorite media?

1732
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Gaming-related media to pass the time.

1733
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Yeah.

1734
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Interesting.

1735
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Like YouTubes.

1736
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Yeah, like, you're listening to, you know, game soundtracks,

1737
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:20,000
watching Twitch channels, uh, uh, reading, uh, gaming-themed books.

1738
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:25,000
I listen to gaming podcasts, and my very favorite is Orange Lounge Radio

1739
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
at vognetwork.com.

1740
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
It should be the answer everyone's giving.

1741
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:30,000
No, I'm just kidding.

1742
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Uh, but sure, gaming podcasts.

1743
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Why not?

1744
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:34,000
I listen to some in my car.

1745
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
I listen to, like, you know, Game Buoy,

1746
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
and if I miss a week of Bobby Black Wolf, you know,

1747
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
some of the other, you know, gaming-related shows here at VOG Network,

1748
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:41,000
I listen to them in my car.

1749
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:42,000
So that's a legit answer.

1750
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Uh, Twitch, absolutely.

1751
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,000
And it's so funny.

1752
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:48,000
You know, I know I was talking about that whole disclaimer about,

1753
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:51,000
you know, things change from 15 years ago, uh, to now.

1754
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Like, I remember there was a time on this show where I was sitting here

1755
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
going, I don't get Twitch.

1756
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Why is Twitch so fucking popular?

1757
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Da-da-da-da-da.

1758
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:02,000
And now it's like, okay, not only do I stream on Twitch,

1759
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
and I'm an affiliate, but it's one of those things where it's like,

1760
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:08,000
yeah, I really do, like, I like to watch people play games on Twitch,

1761
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,000
like, a lot.

1762
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
It's like a fun little, like, just kind of,

1763
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
especially when they just kind of want to, like, chill out on the couch.

1764
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Like, it's a good, it's a good, like, background thing.

1765
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Like, maybe what I'm really doing is I'm on my phone,

1766
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:21,000
like, chatting or texting, but then, like, I have Twitch on the TV,

1767
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
and I'm watching somebody play No Man's Sky,

1768
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
or I'm watching him play Final Fantasy XIV,

1769
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
or some other game maybe I haven't played yet,

1770
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
but I want to see if it's any good,

1771
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:34,000
or maybe my buddy Delvin, shout out to VG Realness,

1772
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
maybe he's streaming Octopath Traveler,

1773
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:39,000
and he's streaming it so much that then I realize,

1774
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
yes, I do need to get this game,

1775
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:44,000
and the little a-hole got me to buy this game,

1776
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Octopath Traveler, because of his streams.

1777
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:51,000
So that's, uh, that's, you know, definitely something I do as well.

1778
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:54,000
And maybe a little bit of YouTubes here and there,

1779
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
but I think I'm more Twitch than YouTube.

1780
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
I don't watch a lot of the on-demand stuff.

1781
02:18:58,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Loki, what about you?

1782
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
I don't watch, I mean, gaming stuff,

1783
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
I don't watch a whole ton of people play games.

1784
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
I do a lot of YouTube, though.

1785
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:10,000
I watch, um, more, like, tech stuff than anything.

1786
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
I mean, occasionally I'll watch Dunkey.

1787
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:13,000
Dunkey's hilarious.

1788
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Um, other YouTubers, um, what else?

1789
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
Oh, God, I'm trying to think.

1790
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Ollie43 does a lot of, like, Grand Theft Auto stuff occasionally,

1791
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:28,000
and will do Fortnite things and, like, MegaRamps and whatnot.

1792
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Um, so he's kind of fun to watch.

1793
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Um, CallMeKevin is another one I watch.

1794
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:34,000
He's pretty funny.

1795
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
He does, like, weird stuff in games

1796
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
and has a pretty funny sense of humor.

1797
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:42,000
James Ski, but most of his stuff is just, like, garbage in VRChat,

1798
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
and he's just kind of ridiculous.

1799
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Isn't this interesting that this just goes to show

1800
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:50,000
that G4TechTV was always gonna die?

1801
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
I mean, the thing about, because people,

1802
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:57,000
it's very similar to, like, the radio, like,

1803
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
and I know I've talked about this on show before,

1804
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:02,000
terrestrial radio is dying because of podcasts and stuff.

1805
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
I used to, I mean, I used to,

1806
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
I don't watch, listen to it too much anymore,

1807
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:11,000
but I used to listen to a lot of the, uh, Twit stuff,

1808
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
um, you know, and the screensavers,

1809
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:16,000
or the new screensavers and all their shows on there,

1810
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:19,000
um, like the Android One stuff, I used to listen to that,

1811
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
or This Week in Tech or something like that,

1812
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
or, no, not This Week in Tech, out of their daily show,

1813
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:24,000
I don't remember what it's called.

1814
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Um, but I do that, and then Linus Tech Tips,

1815
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:31,000
I watch them, I watch him almost every single day,

1816
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
whatever he releases stuff.

1817
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
By the way, Delvin heard me talking shit,

1818
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
he just joined chat, and he's like,

1819
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:38,000
you're welcome.

1820
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:41,000
He heard me talking shit, oh no.

1821
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Uh, quickly, what about you, RageNator?

1822
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Do you do the Twitch stuff, or what's,

1823
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
answer your own question.

1824
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Uh, well, I love listening to gaming soundtracks,

1825
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:55,000
I, by God knows how many, I mean,

1826
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
you know, if I were to listen to everything,

1827
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:00,000
you know, in one big playlist,

1828
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:03,000
it would last roughly about a month,

1829
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
you know, with no repeats.

1830
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Um, you know, in terms of Twitch,

1831
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:10,000
I personally don't broadcast all that often,

1832
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:14,000
but I do like watching your Twits,

1833
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:17,000
I mean, you know, when you or Bobby broadcasts,

1834
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
I'll watch your channels,

1835
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:24,000
I'll watch the God Comms main channel,

1836
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:27,000
along with their, what's it been called,

1837
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:32,000
their guest host individual and personal channels,

1838
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:36,000
I'll watch those, and then there's a few cosplayer

1839
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:39,000
related channels that I'll watch just for the sake

1840
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:43,000
of watching those, so, but that's pretty much it.

1841
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:46,000
I mean, everything else.

1842
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:49,000
RageNator, I just want to jump in real quick

1843
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
to answer some stuff that's come up in chat.

1844
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:54,000
YYR says, terrestrial radio isn't in trouble

1845
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,000
from podcasts, is it?

1846
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
The top 40 in news radio stations

1847
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
probably aren't impacted too much, are they?

1848
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
I didn't really get to finish my full thought on that,

1849
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,000
and I've said this before,

1850
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:05,000
is that where terrestrial radio is shining best,

1851
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
where the other stuff can't really touch them right now,

1852
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:11,000
is local news and local stuff,

1853
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:14,000
and there's always going to be that available.

1854
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
As far as top 40 in that goes,

1855
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:17,000
I suppose there's always the music

1856
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
that's going to be at the dentist's office,

1857
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
because the radio is always something free

1858
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:24,000
that can be turned on at a dentist's office

1859
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:27,000
or at stores and stuff, even though many stores

1860
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
have switched to either satellite radio

1861
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
or their own satellite thing,

1862
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:34,000
or that's oftentimes delivered through the internet,

1863
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:35,000
so that way they can play a song

1864
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
and then have a commercial for what's on sale in your store

1865
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
right there while you're in there.

1866
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
And I think there's another thing there

1867
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
where it's like, if you can't beat them, join them,

1868
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
because Bobby Blackwolf says terrestrial radio

1869
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:48,000
is more in trouble from Pandora, Spotify, and so forth.

1870
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
That's why Clear Channel made iHeartRadio.

1871
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:53,000
They have an app as well as broadcasting on FM.

1872
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:56,000
And yeah, I have to admit, iHeartRadio is pretty cool,

1873
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
because when it comes to the local stuff,

1874
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:01,000
one of the things I really like to do on iHeartRadio

1875
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:06,000
is that I like to go listen to radio stations in other cities.

1876
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Like, I think it's kind of fun to listen to, like,

1877
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
the radio stations, like, in New York City

1878
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
or listen to radio stations in Chicago

1879
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:13,000
just to kind of get, like, you know,

1880
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
like you're visiting somewhere else or something.

1881
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
I don't know. Am I a nerd? I kind of think that's cool.

1882
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Yeah, that's neat.

1883
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Yeah. Anyway. Anyway, quickly, Ray Jare,

1884
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
no other people are trying to get in,

1885
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
but quickly, you said you had some other type of, like, PSA.

1886
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Yeah. Now, as you mentioned before,

1887
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:35,000
you know, someone had recently had, you know,

1888
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:40,000
you know, serious complications related to depression.

1889
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:44,000
And, you know, personally speaking,

1890
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:47,000
I deal with depression myself.

1891
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:52,000
The only thing I can say is if you have issues with depression

1892
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:57,000
and if you see no hope whatsoever,

1893
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:00,000
you're in a lot of pain, so on and so forth,

1894
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
please reach out.

1895
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Be a therapist, your friends, family,

1896
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:08,000
a significant other, whatever.

1897
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:11,000
I know. It's tough.

1898
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:14,000
I've been there. In fact,

1899
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:17,000
I've had an incident last October

1900
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:20,000
where I nearly died myself.

1901
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
I know how it feels.

1902
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
But, you know, sometimes it does look bleak,

1903
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:27,000
but unless you seek out help,

1904
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:31,000
you're not going to find a solution.

1905
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:36,000
And trust me, suicide doesn't work.

1906
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Very well said.

1907
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
A tricky topic.

1908
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
I wasn't really sure how I wanted to approach,

1909
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:47,000
and I think Bobby did a very, very good job on his show earlier

1910
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
if you didn't hear the beginning of the show.

1911
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
And I know this has been a topic

1912
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
that's been weighing on a lot of people's minds this week

1913
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:56,000
with the fourth anniversary of Robin Williams passing,

1914
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:01,000
as well as other things you may or may not be, you know, reading about.

1915
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:06,000
But, yeah, I mean, it's hard

1916
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:09,000
because I want to give you guys a phone number and say,

1917
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
if you're in trouble, call this number.

1918
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:14,000
But I also realize that sometimes when you're struggling

1919
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:17,000
and doing that, like, the brain doesn't always,

1920
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
you know, because when you're sick,

1921
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
you know, your body parts don't always do the things

1922
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
that they ought to be doing,

1923
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
and so your brain doesn't think, I need help.

1924
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
I need to pick up the phone. I need to call somebody.

1925
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:30,000
So I hope, if nothing else, there's that awareness out there

1926
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:33,000
that, you know, no matter who you are or where you're at,

1927
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
there is somebody that fucking cares,

1928
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:38,000
and there is somebody, and probably a lot more somebodies

1929
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
than you think in the moment,

1930
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:45,000
that want to see you beat the demons of depression

1931
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:48,000
and want to see you go and do great things

1932
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:53,000
and get over these demons that are holding you back

1933
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:59,000
and be able to, you know, live a healthy life and all that.

1934
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:02,000
So I hope people feel like, when they're in these moments,

1935
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
just reach out to someone, anyone.

1936
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
And if you feel like there's no one,

1937
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
then there's always going to be these phone numbers and things.

1938
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:11,000
But trust me, reach out to a friend.

1939
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Reach out to a friend you haven't talked to in ten years.

1940
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Trust me, they'll listen.

1941
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
And if you are that person,

1942
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:19,000
it's on the receiving end of one of those things.

1943
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Not that everybody knows what to do in these situations,

1944
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:23,000
but you know what?

1945
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Sometimes, all somebody needs is somebody to just listen

1946
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:29,000
and just say, like, I love you.

1947
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:32,000
I care about you. Like, I care.

1948
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Don't do something to yourself because I care.

1949
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
So, I don't know.

1950
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Exactly.

1951
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:40,000
That's really all the thoughts I can process

1952
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
and put together right now.

1953
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:45,000
I just, you know, all you listeners out there right now,

1954
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
somebody cares about you.

1955
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:51,000
So don't, even when you're in the shittiest position,

1956
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:55,000
please, please, please, don't do anything you'll regret.

1957
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
I don't have all the information,

1958
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:02,000
but I'm pretty sure that there is a nationwide hotline

1959
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:05,000
that people can call you if you need it.

1960
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
And there's, depending on your locality,

1961
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:11,000
there should be a local phone number for you guys,

1962
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:15,000
people that call if you want a local phone number.

1963
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Obviously, I don't have access to everyone's local phone numbers

1964
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
to call for that kind of help,

1965
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:28,000
but if you have access to a phone book, look it up.

1966
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Even if you don't need it for yourself,

1967
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:34,000
have it handy just in case you have a friend or relative

1968
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:37,000
or neighbor that does need that information.

1969
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:41,000
You can say, hey, I see that you're struggling.

1970
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:45,000
Here's a phone number that you can call.

1971
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:50,000
You can talk to them or you can talk to me, that kind of thing.

1972
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:53,000
I'll tell you right now, it's 1-800-273-8255.

1973
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:57,000
That's 1-800-273-TALK is the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

1974
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:02,000
That's probably the most well-known of those types of services.

1975
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:06,000
But I know, for example, if the issues that you're dealing with

1976
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:12,000
are a little more LGBT focused, I know the Trevor Project is huge

1977
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:15,000
and a great, wonderful resource to help,

1978
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:22,000
and I'm trying to look up their information right now.

1979
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:26,000
Pardon me, but this is important as I Google it live as we're here.

1980
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
I believe this is the number here.

1981
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
I hope I'm right because I'm pulling this off of somebody's tweet,

1982
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
but it's 866.

1983
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:33,000
Yeah, I don't think that's right.

1984
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:39,000
I don't think this is the right number. Sorry, guys.

1985
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Sorry, guys. This is horrible that I don't know it in the moment here,

1986
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
but I was not prepared.

1987
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Luckily, okay, I found their official website.

1988
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Here it is, 1-866-488-7386.

1989
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Again, that's a little more geared for youths.

1990
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:56,000
So if you're a youth facing serious LGBTQ-related issues and you need help,

1991
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:59,000
1-866-488-7386 is the Trevor Project.

1992
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:04,000
Again, I also understand that giving a number is only so much.

1993
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:10,000
If nothing else, call anyone. Call anyone.

1994
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Don't battle it alone.

1995
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
I guess that's all I can really say.

1996
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Yeah, as long as you get help in one form or another,

1997
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:23,000
be it a call, go see a therapist in person,

1998
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
speak to a relative in person,

1999
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:30,000
or have lunch with a friend that you haven't seen in a while.

2000
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Something, as long as you don't keep them all shut

2001
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:41,000
and just try to put on a brave face for everyone.

2002
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:44,000
I've had the mentality before of,

2003
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:47,000
oh, yeah, I'll put on a brave face and pretend nothing's wrong,

2004
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:51,000
not to be a burden on everyone else.

2005
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:54,000
That only makes things worse.

2006
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:57,000
Just seek help in whatever way you can.

2007
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Well said.

2008
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
And I think on that note, I'm going to let you go

2009
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
so we can try to get some more calls,

2010
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:05,000
but I think that was a PSA worth our time, so thank you very much.

2011
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Take care.

2012
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Have a nice night.

2013
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:08,000
You too. Bye-bye.

2014
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Orange Launch Radio, all one word if you want to give us a call.

2015
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Orange Launch Radio, all one word if you want to give us a call

2016
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:18,000
and chat about whatever's going on in gaming or what have you this week.

2017
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Wow, phones are on fire tonight.

2018
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:21,000
Let's get to it.

2019
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2020
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:24,000
Hey, this is Ronmo.

2021
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
Hey, Ronmo. What's up, buddy?

2022
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:27,000
Not much.

2023
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
I feel like I'm stuck in a bit of a predicament

2024
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:32,000
because I'm kind of following up with that call,

2025
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
so now I got to bring the funny now.

2026
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:37,000
No, we're resetting the palette.

2027
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Do you want to tell a dick joke or a fart joke?

2028
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:46,000
No, not really, but I just want to know.

2029
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:50,000
We need to stop calling this OLR at this rate, Ron.

2030
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:53,000
We need to start calling it Nostalgic Lounge Radio.

2031
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Why is that?

2032
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:58,000
I don't know. It just seems like almost once in a month

2033
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
we talk about the good times, and I love it,

2034
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:05,000
and we have to remind people that OLR is not just a podcast.

2035
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:08,000
We're a family, and as you were saying,

2036
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:11,000
and I was coming home from my trip this weekend,

2037
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:18,000
how the podcast keeps you going and how everything goes and so forth,

2038
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:21,000
and it got me to thinking how you guys are there for me,

2039
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:24,000
especially you and my times of need.

2040
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:27,000
Well, thank you. Happy to do so.

2041
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
That's what friends are for, as they say.

2042
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Absolutely.

2043
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:33,000
You know, it's interesting, though, because you kind of joke about

2044
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:36,000
how every other episode ends up being a reminiscing episode,

2045
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:40,000
but I think it's come out of our mouths several times tonight,

2046
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:41,000
phrases such as,

2047
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:44,000
if we don't learn from the past, we're doomed to repeat it.

2048
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:47,000
We also have talked about how emulation

2049
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:51,000
and remembering the past of gaming, like, there is something relevant there.

2050
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
We do talk about the good old days. Why?

2051
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:56,000
Because there were some damn fucking good games in those good old days

2052
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:00,000
and things we'd like to see again and things that we hope don't go away,

2053
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
hence me reminiscing about The Guardian legend

2054
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:05,000
and how that is a very hard game to play legally

2055
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:08,000
in this day and age in the year 2018.

2056
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:11,000
So does this mean I have to track down another game pack for you?

2057
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Your mic is cutting out a little bit.

2058
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
I don't know if your mic moved away from your mouth.

2059
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:17,000
Try again?

2060
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:20,000
I said, do I have to track down another copy of the game for you?

2061
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:23,000
No, no, no, we're good there. I'm fine, but I'm talking about other people

2062
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
because I sit here on the show and go,

2063
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
y'all need to play Guardian legend and see what I keep talking about.

2064
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:30,000
It's not easy for everybody to just do that, you know what I mean?

2065
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I can't be like, go on virtual console and get, yeah, I can't even do that.

2066
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:35,000
I mean, I get it.

2067
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:39,000
I'm one of those who went to those sites to pull those games

2068
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:43,000
because there was a lot of awesome Japanese games that came out

2069
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:49,000
for the Super NES and Genesis slash Mega Drive that never came this way.

2070
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:52,000
And this was our way of playing them.

2071
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:55,000
But at the same time, I get the legality of it.

2072
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:58,000
And I had a brief tweet about this.

2073
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
Somebody was like, look at Discotek.

2074
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:04,000
They're going out of their way to track down this anime series.

2075
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:05,000
I forget which one it is.

2076
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:09,000
They're going through Sony to get the master tapes

2077
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
and all that to do the series.

2078
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:16,000
Meanwhile, ROM preservation sites are being shut down.

2079
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
And I said, there's a difference.

2080
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:25,000
Discotek is contacting the manufacturers of the anime to get the tapes.

2081
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:30,000
These companies, I mean, these sites that are preserving ROM games

2082
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:33,000
are just grabbing them and throwing them up there.

2083
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:36,000
They're not contacting the company for permission to host these

2084
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:39,000
because they know they're going to be told, no, you can't do that.

2085
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:40,000
Pull them down.

2086
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:46,000
But it's not going to matter because it's going to go on the ground.

2087
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
There are torrent sites.

2088
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:52,000
There are torrents right now where you can just get every single Nintendo game.

2089
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:57,000
I understand that they file a lawsuit and stuff,

2090
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:01,000
but don't they also have just the DMCA requests and stuff that they can just do?

2091
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:04,000
I don't even know why we have to go through a whole lawsuit thing

2092
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:07,000
other than, oh, we're going to make an example of them

2093
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
telling them that emulation is wrong.

2094
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:13,000
They can put a DMCA request in, and if they don't comply with that,

2095
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
then they can file a lawsuit.

2096
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:21,000
But I see a lot of these sites put that as, hey, yeah, you can report your stuff,

2097
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:24,000
and then we'll take it down if that's the issue.

2098
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
I mean, I don't know.

2099
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:33,000
The thing is these sites are saying that we host these as preservation and archive.

2100
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
That's their way around it.

2101
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
We all know it's not an archive.

2102
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:41,000
And besides, with the DMCA, the site, their repository may be shut down.

2103
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:45,000
They'll just go to another hoster or another bunch of drop boxes and Google drives

2104
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:48,000
and re-upload all the files.

2105
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Yep.

2106
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Hey, Rama, you know what one of my very favorite Super Nintendo games is ever?

2107
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:55,000
What?

2108
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:56,000
It's a game called Equinox.

2109
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:59,000
It was the sequel to a game called Solstice on the NES

2110
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:02,000
that was a very unique kind of 3D perspective.

2111
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:05,000
It had some great music, and it was a really challenging, fun little game.

2112
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Here's the thing.

2113
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:09,000
You will never, well, never say never, I guess,

2114
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:13,000
but it is highly unlikely you will ever be able to play that game through legal channels.

2115
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:16,000
And I'm going to have to tell you, if you want to go play that game,

2116
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:17,000
you're going to have to go download it.

2117
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
You either have to find the cartridge, which is going to be hard to find

2118
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
because I don't think they made a lot of copies of that game,

2119
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:22,000
or you're going to have to go download the ROM.

2120
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:23,000
And you know why?

2121
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:24,000
You know why I have to tell you?

2122
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Because it's never going to be out for you to play legally.

2123
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:27,000
Do you know why that is?

2124
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:28,000
Why?

2125
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:29,000
Because of the publisher.

2126
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:30,000
It was Sony.

2127
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Well, there you go.

2128
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Remember when Sony and Super Nintendo were making Nice Nice for a hot minute there?

2129
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:39,000
Because there was almost a Nintendo PlayStation?

2130
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
Yeah, the Sony CSG Soft.

2131
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Yeah.

2132
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:47,000
So Equinox was one of those games when Sony Image Soft,

2133
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:48,000
I think it was called at the time,

2134
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:52,000
or at least their video game publishing thing was,

2135
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:53,000
and Nintendo were making Nice Nice.

2136
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:54,000
Anyway.

2137
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Rama, I got to wrap up because we got some more calls coming in.

2138
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:58,000
I want to try to get to everybody tonight.

2139
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:01,000
So any other quick thoughts before I let you go?

2140
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:02,000
No, that's it.

2141
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:05,000
And if you don't mind if I show my podcast real quick?

2142
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:06,000
Of course.

2143
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:07,000
Please.

2144
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Awesome.

2145
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:12,000
We're going to be talking about Otacon 2018 tomorrow on Tuesday on Anime Jam Session.

2146
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:15,000
You don't have anything to say about that.

2147
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Maybe.

2148
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:22,000
I'll talk about my big purchase of the console.

2149
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:23,000
Okay.

2150
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:24,000
Cool.

2151
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:25,000
All right.

2152
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
Check out Anime Jam Session Tuesday nights here at VOG.

2153
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:28,000
Do it.

2154
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:29,000
Yas, queen.

2155
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:30,000
All right.

2156
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Good night, my friend.

2157
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Bye.

2158
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:34,000
Bye.

2159
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype.

2160
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
I see some more folks trying to get through.

2161
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:39,000
Please keep trying.

2162
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
I'm going to really try to get to everybody tonight.

2163
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:42,000
Hi.

2164
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:43,000
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

2165
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Who's this?

2166
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Hey.

2167
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:46,000
This is SSJ1 and you're Matt.

2168
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:47,000
So good to hear from you, Matt.

2169
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
What's on your mind?

2170
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Not much.

2171
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
I wanted to talk about it.

2172
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
You guys might have brought it up earlier.

2173
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
I might have stepped away.

2174
02:36:56,000 --> 02:37:01,000
But I wanted to get your thoughts on how Pokemon Go Community Weekend was for you.

2175
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:02,000
You know what?

2176
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Thank you for asking.

2177
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:07,000
Because when I talked about my gaming week, I completely neglected to talk about it.

2178
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:08,000
I did as well.

2179
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:09,000
I forgot.

2180
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Okay.

2181
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:11,000
So no, you didn't miss it.

2182
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:12,000
Here's the thing.

2183
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:13,000
We just played it so much.

2184
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:14,000
I know.

2185
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:15,000
Honestly.

2186
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:19,000
Can I forget every week to mention, oh yeah, I played Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme too.

2187
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:22,000
So I played so much Pokemon Go today that I'm actually kind of sick of it.

2188
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:23,000
So here's the thing.

2189
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:27,000
Because of the other stuff I had going on yesterday, I didn't really get to participate

2190
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:28,000
in the Saturday day.

2191
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:31,000
So I actually kind of love that it was two days this weekend.

2192
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:35,000
And I know they also did that because of the number of Eeveelutions that there are.

2193
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:38,000
I wish they would just do it for like more than three hours.

2194
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:39,000
But I did.

2195
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Well, they did this weekend.

2196
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
They did three hours Saturday, three hours Sunday.

2197
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Six hours.

2198
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:44,000
I know.

2199
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:45,000
I know.

2200
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:46,000
I know.

2201
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:47,000
But anyway.

2202
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:48,000
All day.

2203
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:49,000
Anyway.

2204
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:52,000
So I caught one shiny Eevee yesterday because I have this little Bluetooth.

2205
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
It's not a Pokemon Go Plus, but it's a Gotcha.

2206
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:57,000
So I think a lot of you players know what that is.

2207
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:58,000
So I have a Gotcha.

2208
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:03,000
And between like the freeway and Melody's house, because I wanted to spin some of the

2209
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:04,000
stops.

2210
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:08,000
I got a shiny Eevee somehow because it was right about 1130 when I was getting over to

2211
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:09,000
Melody's house.

2212
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
So I caught a shiny Eevee on Saturday.

2213
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Today, I went down to Capitol Park, as I usually do.

2214
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:15,000
It's one of the big hotspots here.

2215
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
And I went and I.

2216
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:21,000
So if you all are getting gifts, they're like Sacramento State Capitol or it's because that's

2217
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:24,000
where I like to play.

2218
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:33,000
So I went down there today and in the first two hours, I caught one and I was like, oh

2219
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
God, this is how this day is going to go.

2220
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:41,000
And meanwhile, Shane being Shane is like, yeah, I caught 10 yesterday and I'm up to

2221
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:42,000
six today.

2222
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
I'm just like, I hate him.

2223
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:45,000
I fucking hate him.

2224
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:46,000
How does he have all this shiny luck?

2225
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
Does he have a shiny charm?

2226
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:49,000
Anyway.

2227
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:50,000
But so here's the thing.

2228
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
So I started joking with my friends that I was walking with.

2229
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:55,000
I was like, man, I'm not going to get any shiny.

2230
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Pokemon Go is lame anyway.

2231
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:58,000
I don't care.

2232
02:38:58,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Nobody plays this game anymore.

2233
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:00,000
I don't need shinies.

2234
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
So I was kind of like doing that whole thing.

2235
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:05,000
Like I wasn't serious, but I was, you know, kind of doing that whole thing.

2236
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:06,000
And then I shit you not.

2237
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:11,000
After my complaining fest, we start walking from where we're at to Starbucks to get a

2238
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:12,000
drink because it's kind of hot here right now.

2239
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:16,000
I caught in the scope of 20 minutes and I'm not exaggerating this.

2240
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Six shiny EVs in 20 minutes.

2241
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Like it got to the point where like I pull up the first one.

2242
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:25,000
I'm like, oh, haha.

2243
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Complaining works.

2244
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:27,000
I got another one.

2245
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:28,000
I pull up the second one.

2246
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:29,000
Wow.

2247
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Complaining really works.

2248
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:31,000
I pull up the third one.

2249
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:34,000
Hey guys, maybe you want to start complaining loudly about the game too because there's

2250
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:35,000
something to this.

2251
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:39,000
And like as we're standing in line at Starbucks, I'm tapping on the EVs at Starbucks.

2252
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
I catch two while we're at Starbucks.

2253
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:45,000
I show my friends my phone and they're like, what the fuck, dude?

2254
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:47,000
What are you doing?

2255
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
And I'm like, I don't know.

2256
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:52,000
Like even I admit this is ridiculous.

2257
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:53,000
Yeah.

2258
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:56,000
So I ended the whole event with eight shiny EVs and so I was very happy.

2259
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Now, of course, I started evolving all but two because obviously I'm going to walk the

2260
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
two so I get Espeon and Umbreon.

2261
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:10,000
And of course, as I evolve them, I get three Flareons and two, three Flareons and two Vaporeons.

2262
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:11,000
No Jolteons.

2263
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:12,000
Yeah.

2264
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:16,000
But that's why they do trading because my friend really wanted a Vaporeon and he got

2265
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:17,000
four Jolteons.

2266
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:20,000
So that's what trading is for.

2267
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:23,000
So, yeah, no, like my weekend was kind of similar.

2268
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:30,000
Like the first day, like I caught, I only got like one or two in the first hour, first

2269
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:31,000
two and a half hours.

2270
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:35,000
The last half hour of it, I caught six after that.

2271
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:36,000
Okay.

2272
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:37,000
So you had similar luck.

2273
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:38,000
Yeah.

2274
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:39,000
Yes.

2275
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Yes.

2276
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:41,000
Similar luck.

2277
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
Somewhat similar too.

2278
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:46,000
Like I caught ten today and previously I caught eight.

2279
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:47,000
Wow.

2280
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:50,000
So you have enough EVs to start thinking about gen four stuff.

2281
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:54,000
See, that's my problem is I can't really think about gen four because I barely have

2282
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:57,000
enough to get me through gens one, two and three, you know?

2283
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Yeah.

2284
02:40:58,000 --> 02:40:59,000
Yeah.

2285
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:04,000
And I know this is like they've, so people have kind of been saying like there's a

2286
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:10,000
maybe a little bit of method to the shinies popping up saying like, oh, if you click on

2287
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:15,000
the first, the one that pops up, you get you, you're more likely to get a shiny.

2288
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:20,000
There's other talk of people saying like if you go into a less densely populated area,

2289
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
you're more apt to get more shinies.

2290
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:28,000
I can confirm that that's bullshit all around because I got zero shinies and I was playing

2291
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:33,000
in very undense populated areas and I played for a long time and I got jack shit.

2292
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Yeah.

2293
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:39,000
So I don't know if there's anything to that, but no.

2294
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:45,000
So I kind of like them doing this whole weekend thing because I think it just works for everybody's

2295
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:46,000
schedule.

2296
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:51,000
It's like, so I'm curious what they're going to do for the next one because you know, we

2297
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:54,000
were getting like Bulbasaur, Charmander or Squirtle.

2298
02:41:54,000 --> 02:42:01,000
So, you know, the obvious choice for the next community day would be Chikorita, right?

2299
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
Gen two is grass starter, right?

2300
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:04,000
Yeah.

2301
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:05,000
They were, yeah.

2302
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
The things that I was reading, it's like, it could be like Ralts.

2303
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
It could be like Chikorita could be Totodile.

2304
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:10,000
Yeah.

2305
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:11,000
It could be anything really.

2306
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:17,000
And I wonder could they, could they unveil gen four starting during the community day?

2307
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:20,000
Well, they were supposed, the thought was that they were going to do that this time,

2308
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:21,000
but they didn't.

2309
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:22,000
Yeah.

2310
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:29,000
Well, I saw like a weird tweet go out about how they're kind of starting to promote Celebi

2311
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:33,000
as you know, the next mythical research.

2312
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Mm hmm.

2313
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:38,000
Well, because actually, um, Shane already has a Celebi because he went to go fest.

2314
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:41,000
So all the people who went to go fest got to do the quest there.

2315
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:42,000
Yeah.

2316
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:43,000
Yeah.

2317
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
So I think they're kind of maybe getting towards that.

2318
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:46,000
Yeah.

2319
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:49,000
I think, like, I think the Celebi quests are going to, like, they're going to pull the

2320
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
curtain back on that in the next couple of weeks.

2321
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:52,000
I really think so.

2322
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Uh, obviously we know we're getting Reggie rock next week.

2323
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:57,000
Um, so I think Celebi will come soon after that.

2324
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
Probably, you know, close enough to Labor Day.

2325
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:03,000
I'm curious if there's going to be an event going on over Labor Day weekend, but I think

2326
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:08,000
that is when Japan has their, cause you know, Europe had an event, the U S had an event.

2327
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:12,000
I think Japan's event is over Labor Day weekend and that's going to be interesting cause I'll

2328
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:16,000
be at dragon con, but that is when shiny wingle is expected to debut.

2329
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:17,000
Yeah.

2330
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:24,000
So I, so I wondered like, so they, so Niantic did a little cross promotion thing with Paxi,

2331
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:25,000
with Paxis.

2332
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:29,000
They had pretty much unknowns drop all around the Harbor area.

2333
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:30,000
Mm hmm.

2334
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:35,000
And then E3, they had, uh, unknowns drop around there.

2335
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:40,000
So I wonder, like, it could be possible they could do it at a dragon con.

2336
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
I would love it if they did it at dragon con.

2337
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:46,000
I don't know if they will cause dragon con is, if I remember right, Bobby, correct me

2338
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:50,000
if I'm wrong, but I think dragon con is still a hundred percent fan run and it seems like

2339
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:54,000
it's more the commercial stuff that gets the big, uh, unknowns like comic con and packs

2340
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:59,000
and stuff are all, you know, cause remember the guys at Pax sold Pax expo a while ago.

2341
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Uh, so because dragon con is still fan run, they probably don't exactly know who to call

2342
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:04,000
it Niantic.

2343
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Uh, but I know, uh, our buddy Charles from the Pokemon go podcast, who is a big part

2344
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
of the podcasting track at dragon con.

2345
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
A big part of the reason why I'm able to do as much as I am.

2346
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:15,000
So a big thanks to him.

2347
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Uh, I, I know he's pushing for that and he would love that.

2348
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:19,000
So I, I don't know.

2349
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:20,000
We'll see.

2350
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:24,000
I would love it if dragon con would get the unknowns, but I'm not, not going to hold my

2351
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:25,000
breath.

2352
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:29,000
And, uh, Bobby black golf also theorizing Niantic is probably doing it with packs prime

2353
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:30,000
or packs west.

2354
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:34,000
I guess they stopped calling it packs prime packs west because it's at the same time.

2355
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:35,000
That's right.

2356
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Yep.

2357
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:37,000
That I could, I, you know what?

2358
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:38,000
I believe that.

2359
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:39,000
All right.

2360
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Well to my number six best friend, I'm going to have to let you go.

2361
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
I just, I just checked my list.

2362
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:44,000
So here's the current ranking.

2363
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:50,000
My, my buddy Kyle in Toronto is the only person that I have exchanged or done a gift with

2364
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
every single day since this rolled out.

2365
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:53,000
So he's my number one.

2366
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
Act deft is number two.

2367
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:56,000
Ooh.

2368
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
My old roommate, John is number three.

2369
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:01,000
Uh, one of my ingress buddies is number four, a Panda, we call him.

2370
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
And then Loki's number five.

2371
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:04,000
And then you're number six.

2372
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
And I, and I just friended Loki.

2373
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:10,000
So now, so now I can kind of stagger that, uh, friend bonus.

2374
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:11,000
Nice.

2375
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:16,000
But I'm sure some, I'm sure someday we'll, we'll be able to do trades as best friends.

2376
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:17,000
Yes.

2377
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:18,000
That'll, that'll be great.

2378
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:19,000
That's the whole reason to do it.

2379
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:20,000
Yeah, for sure.

2380
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:23,000
Um, the thing about shinies, they cost an arm and a leg to trade.

2381
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:26,000
If you don't have them, they, they, they go with the legendary costs.

2382
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:29,000
So if you're not three or four star friends, forget it.

2383
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:30,000
Yeah.

2384
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:31,000
All right.

2385
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:32,000
All right.

2386
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:33,000
My friend, I'm gonna let you go.

2387
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:34,000
All right.

2388
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:35,000
Take care.

2389
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:36,000
Take care.

2390
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:37,000
Thank you.

2391
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:38,000
Yep.

2392
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:39,000
Well, weren't they supposed to be doing, um, like some sort of treating one more chance

2393
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:40,000
to get in.

2394
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:41,000
I saw somebody else calling.

2395
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:42,000
I'd really love to get on it.

2396
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:43,000
One more chance to get an orange.

2397
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:46,000
I was going to cost less to do trades for awhile.

2398
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:49,000
They are doing an event right now where you get more candy from it.

2399
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:54,000
Oh, so like I traded somebody today, like I had a slack off that I caught in Chicago

2400
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:58,000
and I traded it for just another slack off so we could get thousands of kilometers of

2401
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:59,000
distance.

2402
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:05,000
And I got six slack off candies, which was all I needed to evolve my, uh, slacking my,

2403
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:08,000
what, which is actually my second slacking, but this one is appraised as a wonder.

2404
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
So it's going to be a better slacking.

2405
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:11,000
Mm hmm.

2406
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:14,000
So cause those, those guys are kind of Jim beasts.

2407
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:15,000
So that's kind of fun.

2408
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:19,000
S2100 Matt says they did have that event where it was 25% less starters to trade.

2409
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
I didn't even really, I must've missed it.

2410
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:22,000
I haven't been doing a lot of trading.

2411
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:25,000
Today was actually the first day I got a lucky Pokemon.

2412
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
I have not gotten one of those either.

2413
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:30,000
The only, and it was a, what did I trade for it?

2414
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
I gave him something.

2415
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
Oh, we did a distance trade.

2416
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:41,000
So, so there's a buddy in, um, Australia that I have and uh, let me, um, high collar.

2417
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:42,000
I'll get to you in just a minute.

2418
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:47,000
So, um, there's a, there's a friend that I have in Australia that I think is a listener to the show.

2419
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
So shout out to a Clover Nikon if you're there.

2420
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:53,000
So, uh, he sends presents from Australia.

2421
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:58,000
So I opened an egg cause the eggs are attached to where your friends are when they send them to you.

2422
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
So this egg was Australia.

2423
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
So my friend today was like, Oh, I want to trade for distance.

2424
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:05,000
And I'm like, Oh, well I have this, you know, it's just a Sandshrew or something.

2425
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:06,000
It wasn't something I need to hang onto.

2426
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
So I'm like, I have this Sandshrew, but it's from Australia.

2427
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:11,000
So if you don't have your bronze medal yet, you'll get it off this.

2428
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
It's going to be like thousands of kilometers.

2429
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:17,000
So, uh, he gave me the Arcanine or whatever that thing is called.

2430
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:21,000
He gave me that Arcanine. No, that would be a spider Arcanine.

2431
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:24,000
So, um, uh, he traded that.

2432
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:27,000
He's just like, I just have this throwaway thing from like Costa Mesa when I was on a trip.

2433
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
So we traded that.

2434
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:35,000
And when that came over, not only did the stats go up so that it was a wonder for me, it was high appraisal,

2435
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
but then it was a lucky Pokemon.

2436
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:40,000
So I know those fire, they're fire dark doggies.

2437
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:43,000
They're not like the greatest Pokemon, but they're not, they don't suck.

2438
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:46,000
Like they're, they're, they'll hold their own in raids if you need them.

2439
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
Anyway, I got a call or I'm making wait.

2440
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
So let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Mountain Radio. Who's this?

2441
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:54,000
Hi, it's YYR trying to be very quiet.

2442
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:57,000
No, I know you have a new baby.

2443
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
So, uh, congrats and everything.

2444
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Your, your baby is not that far apart in age from the baby I went to visit yesterday who just hit three months.

2445
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:08,000
So, so what's up buddy?

2446
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:17,000
Oh, well, I mean, first of all, I just want to let any prospective parents know it is a lot.

2447
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
It's a lot of work.

2448
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
It's a lot to have to handle.

2449
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:24,000
Loki is not all the, you know, shiny rainbows and all that.

2450
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:27,000
So Loki doesn't get better when the kids get turned seven years old.

2451
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:32,000
No, it gets different, right?

2452
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:33,000
They just whine more.

2453
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:38,000
They whine more. They're able to verbalize their problems a lot more.

2454
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:43,000
Yeah. Everyone just says it gets better. It gets better. I'm convinced it probably just gets different.

2455
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:44,000
It gets better.

2456
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:45,000
At least until, you know, they turn 18.

2457
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:49,000
Yeah. I was like, it gets better when they turn 18 and they move out.

2458
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:52,000
My wife is nodding.

2459
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:55,000
No, but I think it's great. You guys made a child. That's amazing.

2460
02:48:55,000 --> 02:49:01,000
You know, kids aren't for everyone. Alan and I decided a long time ago it's not for us, but we love cats and we have cats.

2461
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:04,000
Hey, if you can come to an agreement, that's the best thing.

2462
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
Absolutely. Absolutely.

2463
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:12,000
So I know you didn't just want to talk about babies solely tonight. What else did you want to talk about?

2464
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:18,000
Well, first of all, the Bethesda Sony thing that you touched on earlier.

2465
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:19,000
Yeah.

2466
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:33,000
So I really think that Sony is in one of those sorts of positions where, you know, doubling down, they think, is going to look better to them than changing course.

2467
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:37,000
I don't know why I get that impression, but that's just the impression that I get.

2468
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:46,000
I have a feeling that they would rather double down than say, oh, you know, we're going to reverse position and play nice with everybody now.

2469
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:49,000
I don't know why I feel that way, but I just, that's the feeling that I get.

2470
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:54,000
Yeah, but the problem is it bit Microsoft in the butt eventually. It's going to bite Sony in the butt eventually, too.

2471
02:49:54,000 --> 02:50:00,000
I know, I know, you know, because we were talking a little bit in the chat and so forth, and I know, you know, guys on Twitter are whatever.

2472
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:11,000
It's not a big deal, but it's like, you know, when you start hearing more stories like this, when the press starts doing more reporting, when the business journal is asking Resi Fizame about, you know, this stuff.

2473
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:21,000
I think it is starting to hit the mainstream press, like that noise is going to come to a point and it is going to start to affect Sony when they start talking about things like PlayStation 5.

2474
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:29,000
You know, that's, that's when Microsoft really had to pay the piper was that people really shredded them when it came to the Xbox One. You know what I mean?

2475
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:30,000
So if Sony doesn't kind of...

2476
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:36,000
Yeah, I mean, it may, but you're also comparing Xbox with PlayStation and here's the thing.

2477
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:44,000
So Microsoft had to really claw and tear their way to where they got with the 360.

2478
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:57,000
As it is worldwide, even at the height of the 360's popularity, PlayStation was still much more popular in Europe, much more popular in Asia.

2479
02:50:57,000 --> 02:51:05,000
And, you know, they basically have the dominant world position when it comes to gaming as a brand.

2480
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:15,000
I don't think there, any bad will that comes from this, I don't think it would hurt them as much as it would hurt Microsoft in the long run.

2481
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:24,000
I think that they have enough loyal players, loyal fans that this is barely going to register on their radar.

2482
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:33,000
I would, you know what, I will concede this point because you do bring up a really good point about the global market and Microsoft doesn't matter in Japan.

2483
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:37,000
There are not, I get that the Xbox One is sold there, it's a non-issue in Japan.

2484
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:41,000
So Sony can get away with this in Japan a hundred percent.

2485
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
Sony can get away with this a hundred percent.

2486
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:53,000
But I mean, but also now we're talking about the Nintendo Switch and PC and I think as the Switch starts to grow, if the Switch can kind of cross play with some things, I mean, I don't know.

2487
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:57,000
It's going to be interesting. I still think it's going to kind of come to a point eventually.

2488
02:51:57,000 --> 02:52:03,000
Especially if Sony just kind of continues this sort of attitude that led to this decision.

2489
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:13,000
You know, I think that's also part of what really defeated Microsoft is that they kind of went in there unveiling the Xbox One thinking we're going to do all these things that the gamers want.

2490
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:17,000
And it was just, it was just too early and it was really miss sold.

2491
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:21,000
I think they had, we all know they had a horrible person at home.

2492
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:27,000
Yeah, at the end of the day though, it's like, okay, so the PS4 has no backwards compatibility.

2493
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:30,000
So you still can't change your name on PSN.

2494
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:35,000
So, I mean, there's a lot of ways, services where Microsoft exceeds Sony.

2495
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:44,000
It doesn't matter. PlayStation 4 has the exclusives and, you know, the global fan base.

2496
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:48,000
And once again, it's there in the position of dominance right now.

2497
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:52,000
And I don't think they need to worry about these things as much if they don't want to.

2498
02:52:52,000 --> 02:53:03,000
I mean, yeah, it would be the nice friendly, player friendly thing to do to open up their this and that and the other thing and to add all those features I mentioned.

2499
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:14,000
But, I mean, unless someone lights a fire under them and I don't think it's going to be Nintendo because I'm still convinced that the Switch is not direct competition to the PS4.

2500
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:18,000
So, no, I don't, I don't think that either.

2501
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:24,000
But I think, I think ultimately it's going to be companies like Bethesda over here that are going to end up lighting that fire.

2502
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:28,000
And, you know, sure, you know, the card game is whatever.

2503
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,000
It's not going to be something that affects a ton of people.

2504
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:40,000
But when it's Street Fighter 5, you know, or Street Fighter 6, should I say, or, or whatever, like Fortnite 2, or even as Loki says, very tongue in cheek Minecraft 2.

2505
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:44,000
Although that's a whole nother issue since we all know Microsoft runs the Minecraft ship now.

2506
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:50,000
I think they would do very well to, to conveniently not release on Sony's platform for a few months.

2507
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:51,000
I think they would.

2508
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
I'm sorry, it's just, you know, that's business.

2509
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:57,000
Wanted to do, you know, cross play and you just want to play.

2510
02:53:57,000 --> 02:54:04,000
But anyway, all right, I do, I do still appreciate your viewpoint, your thoughts, especially, you know, you do bring us some very good points with the global market.

2511
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
I think sometimes we forget.

2512
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
So, yeah, I mean, we'll see how this plays out.

2513
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:14,000
I think, yeah, I'm excited as a spectator to see how, how this plays out, how all of it goes and what happens.

2514
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:15,000
For sure.

2515
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up though.

2516
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:20,000
But take care and it's always, it's good as always to hear from you.

2517
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,000
Hey, no problem.

2518
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:24,000
I'll just mention one quick thing on the way out.

2519
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:25,000
Yeah, yeah.

2520
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:32,000
I'm not making any official announcements yet, but I've started working on bungee ferret tossing again.

2521
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:35,000
You may or may not see it on Steam before the end of the year.

2522
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:36,000
Yay!

2523
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:37,000
That makes me excited.

2524
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:41,000
Yeah, you can always put it on a Discord Steam store there.

2525
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:42,000
Also.

2526
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:43,000
Don't pay money.

2527
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:50,000
I have noticed that super multitasking has been getting some updates and, you know, I read your changelog and I can see what you're kind of doing.

2528
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
You've kind of going back and addressing a few things.

2529
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:57,000
You obviously have been distracted for a few months by the baby, which everybody completely understands and respects.

2530
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:07,000
But, you know, as a super multitasking fan, I was very excited to see, ooh, they're still making, Aaron's in there making updates again.

2531
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:08,000
That's awesome.

2532
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:15,000
Yeah, I mean, honestly, most of it is just to fix something that was, ugh, the whole thing was frustrating.

2533
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:24,000
Long story very short, a third-party library that I used for the Steam support, leaderboards, stats, and so on, it broke.

2534
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:31,000
And they basically didn't provide any support, so I had to redo the Steam support from scratch using a totally different library.

2535
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:34,000
Yikes. Well, you got it, though. Congrats.

2536
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:40,000
My one request, though, before you put out bungee ferret tossing on Steam, which you may or may not be confirming right now.

2537
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:43,000
Please let me submit a picture of Mr. Smoosh for inclusion.

2538
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:46,000
Oh, yes, the call will go out for more pet pictures.

2539
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:50,000
Okay, amazing. All right. All right, my friend, I'm gonna let you go. Best of luck.

2540
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:51,000
Have a great week, guys.

2541
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:52,000
You, too. Bye.

2542
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:53,000
Thank you.

2543
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:56,000
All right, that is gonna do it for the Skypline tonight. Thanks so much to all the callers.

2544
02:55:56,000 --> 02:56:00,000
But if you didn't get through for whatever reason, it's, we're after nine o'clock, I gotta wrap up.

2545
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:04,000
But if you didn't get through for whatever reason, please feel free to send us a tweet at OLR.

2546
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:08,000
You can always email us, of course. Participate at orangelaunchradio.com.

2547
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:14,000
Sj100matt pointing out tonight's calls were off in the state of New York. All four callers were from New York tonight. That's very true.

2548
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:22,000
Do you know, that goes back to the live 365 days when you could see, like, what markets, like, number one was always Sacramento, obviously,

2549
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:25,000
because that's where the show is based and where all our friends are that we were telling about the show.

2550
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:30,000
But the number two market for this show is, like, almost always been New York, which I find.

2551
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:36,000
I always just kind of was like, well, it's, you know, New York City is a big city, of course, but no, you guys are awesome.

2552
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:42,000
All of you are awesome, though, no matter where you live, where you're from. International listenership is amazing as well.

2553
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:46,000
Met so many, so many people around the world. All right, anyway, we gotta wrap up for the night.

2554
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:50,000
Thank you guys so much. I did not even check if there's any last minute stories, but at this point.

2555
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:54,000
I was just gonna mention one thing I saw here. Quake Champions went free to play.

2556
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,000
Oh, yeah, I did hear about that. That was other news.

2557
02:56:56,000 --> 02:57:01,000
So they have an option where they're gonna rotate out a certain champion that'll be free,

2558
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:08,000
and then you can unlock more by earning the favor in matches, or I think you can also pay to unlock stuff too.

2559
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:14,000
Nice. All right. Well, we're gonna wrap it up here at Orange Launch Radio, but if you enjoyed what you heard here at the show tonight,

2560
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:19,000
please tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

2561
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:23,000
but if the voices aren't here to air, then what are we gonna say? Nothing.

2562
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:27,000
So anyway, please help us spread the word. A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes,

2563
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:31,000
or wherever it is that you heard about this program. Those reviews go a very long way,

2564
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:35,000
and I really do appreciate them, so thank you, thank you to those that are leaving them.

2565
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:40,000
That does it. Let's go around and get folks' final thought for the night. Loki!

2566
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:47,000
My final thought is, sometimes the sound of goodbye is louder than any drum beat.

2567
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:51,000
Okay, throwing it back, seventh style. I see you. I see you.

2568
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:57,000
Then let's see, my final thought would be, um...

2569
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:07,000
I guess then my final thought would be, die, Suke.

2570
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:11,000
And until then, until next week, we'll see you in seven days, when once again we can...

2571
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:15,000
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

2572
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:18,000
