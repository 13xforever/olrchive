00:00.000 --> 00:17.440
A quote that resurfaced after the Boston Marathon bombings explained why people ran

00:17.440 --> 00:19.560
towards the danger rather than away.

00:19.560 --> 00:20.640
Look for the helpers.

00:20.640 --> 00:24.840
In the face of tragedy, camaraderie, sportsmanship, and care for your fellow persons is truly

00:24.840 --> 00:26.200
the greatest of deeds.

00:26.200 --> 00:32.560
Stay tuned for more.

00:32.560 --> 00:35.920
Hello everybody and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.440
It's Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.440 --> 00:41.600
Tonight, episode 743 for this, August 26th of 2018.

00:41.600 --> 00:44.360
I'm Rob Roberts and he is Techmaster Loki.

00:44.360 --> 00:45.800
I'm also stuffed up.

00:45.800 --> 00:48.880
Yeah, you're stuffed up and I have this voice.

00:48.880 --> 00:52.560
I hosted Rocky Horror last night and my voice, you know, it's a lot of yelling and screaming.

00:52.560 --> 00:56.800
I'm just shoving spicy salsa in my mouth constantly.

00:56.800 --> 00:57.800
Take it easy.

00:57.800 --> 00:58.800
Take it easy over there.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.480
We got a long show for you guys tonight.

01:00.480 --> 01:05.480
Not here tonight, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, she is still on leave due to a work conflict.

01:05.480 --> 01:11.440
Join us live, participate with our show at live.vognetwork.com as we are live every Sunday

01:11.440 --> 01:15.240
night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com

01:15.240 --> 01:18.160
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:18.160 --> 01:21.580
And yeah, I want to get into the big topic I think that's on everybody's minds right

01:21.600 --> 01:28.100
now and this is supposed to be the show that's gonna sit on the feed for two weeks and when

01:28.100 --> 01:32.980
I meet some new people at Dragon Con, this might be the first episode that they're hearing

01:32.980 --> 01:36.820
and it's unfortunate because we've got this really kind of heavy topic to start things

01:36.820 --> 01:37.820
off tonight.

01:37.820 --> 01:42.500
So if you are brand new to Orange Launch Radio, maybe go listen to last week's show.

01:42.500 --> 01:46.900
It's Loki getting angry at Nintendo's lack of online hits every week, but that's the

01:46.900 --> 01:47.900
stuff you expect.

01:48.780 --> 01:54.940
This week is just like anger in general and disappointment and just not understanding

01:54.940 --> 01:58.940
a lot of stuff and obviously I'm referring to everything that happened in Jacksonville

01:58.940 --> 02:05.620
today and I imagine most of you read the internet and use some type of social media with some

02:05.620 --> 02:10.620
form of regularity, so I am sure you have all seen the news now, however, keeping in

02:10.620 --> 02:14.420
mind that we have an international audience that maybe has not heard, let me just be straight

02:14.940 --> 02:20.340
or at least what we know here on Sunday evening, going off of a CBS News article that I'm

02:20.340 --> 02:25.700
looking at here, we had an incident today in Jacksonville, Florida, where there was

02:25.700 --> 02:31.900
a shooter at a video game tournament that unfortunately has killed two other people

02:31.900 --> 02:37.260
and then the shooter themselves killed themselves, so that would be three dead as of the time

02:37.260 --> 02:40.900
that we're mentioning this and then of course multiple injuries, I'd heard 10, I'd heard

02:40.900 --> 02:43.900
11, I've seen a bunch of numbers going around out there.

02:43.900 --> 02:49.860
The game in question, Madden 19, was the tournament that was being held here in Jacksonville,

02:49.860 --> 02:55.900
this was some type of pre-qualifier for a larger Madden, you'll have to excuse me, it's

02:55.900 --> 03:00.820
no secret that I do not follow the sports games as much here on OLR.

03:00.820 --> 03:02.620
They're Madden's challenge thing that we do here.

03:02.620 --> 03:06.620
And not that that makes what's happening here any different because this could, you know,

03:06.620 --> 03:10.100
we just talked about Evo a couple weeks ago on the show, fighting game tournaments, we

03:10.100 --> 03:15.500
talk about tournaments for music games is something that we used to go to all the time

03:15.500 --> 03:19.220
and they still have music game tournaments and Overwatch is certainly a big thing and

03:19.220 --> 03:20.220
so on and so on.

03:20.220 --> 03:23.180
I mean it kind of doesn't matter, the game, because I think a lot of us are kind of sitting

03:23.180 --> 03:29.940
here going, you know, this could have been a tournament that I might have attended.

03:29.940 --> 03:35.460
And so anyway, the shooter, who is apparently from Baltimore actually, and my understanding

03:35.460 --> 03:39.620
is that he was a competitor in this event.

03:39.620 --> 03:43.700
Now this is where things get fuzzy and rumors, I don't know how far down this rabbit hole

03:43.700 --> 03:49.300
I want to go, but the chatter is that he is somebody who played the tournament earlier

03:49.300 --> 03:56.180
in the day, lost, and this may have been what he did in response, which, you know, makes

03:56.180 --> 04:04.900
us all go just like jaw dropping, like how can any person see that as a rational response

04:04.900 --> 04:08.740
to any type of situation, let be alone a fucking video game.

04:08.740 --> 04:12.100
Yeah, these are the people we need the arm.

04:12.100 --> 04:19.260
Anyway, this tournament was being held at the GLHF Game Bar, it's part restaurant.

04:19.260 --> 04:22.700
This seems like just kind of one of those, like the area that this is in looks like one

04:22.700 --> 04:27.660
of those like downtown mall, hip spot, hangout type of places, it's out on the wharf.

04:27.660 --> 04:31.260
We have places in old Sacramento like this, I'm sure it's just, you know, it's a gathering

04:31.260 --> 04:35.420
spot, so this is probably a tourism thing to bring in all these people for this Madden

04:35.420 --> 04:40.260
tournament that was going on, and now it's ended in this horrible tragedy, 150 people

04:40.260 --> 04:46.720
overall involved in this event, and so on, and thanks to social media, you're getting

04:46.720 --> 04:50.660
some of the players that are out there tweeting that are saying, you know, this is the worst

04:50.660 --> 04:54.900
day, I'm never doing this again until they beef up security, and just, I think you're

04:54.900 --> 04:59.260
just seeing a lot of people processing in real time, which is the upside and the downside

04:59.260 --> 05:03.660
of social media and a lot of that instant gratification that we have in the year 2018,

05:03.780 --> 05:07.860
which also, I suppose, would be related to the instant gratification of the fact that

05:07.860 --> 05:14.860
yes, this was all being streamed on Twitch, now the good news is video was not captured

05:14.860 --> 05:19.500
of the incident, which I, you know, in the case of law enforcement and trying to figure

05:19.500 --> 05:23.420
out and answer some of those questions, that's probably not a good thing, but I would assume

05:23.420 --> 05:27.520
there were security cameras at the place and they'll do what they need to do with that,

05:27.520 --> 05:31.820
but I'm saying in the sense of the internet, I think it's a good thing that they, it just

05:31.820 --> 05:36.740
happened that they were flipping to on Twitch, they went to like the kickoff, so like, you

05:36.740 --> 05:40.780
know how it is, it's like a picture in picture for a minute, and then it went, the picture

05:40.780 --> 05:44.900
in picture went away and it was mad and full screen when the incident happened, so we didn't

05:44.900 --> 05:52.380
see the video, but unfortunately, the audio's there, and it's like, I, I'm not gonna lie,

05:52.380 --> 05:58.420
I listened to it, against my better judgment, I listened to it, I wish I hadn't, so I'm

05:58.420 --> 06:03.560
gonna say, you know, all those of you that are like curious as well, I would just take

06:03.560 --> 06:08.820
my word for it, you don't need to hear it, and I'm not gonna spread that around any further,

06:08.820 --> 06:13.460
if you wanna find it, you can find it, but again, I would encourage you not to do it,

06:13.460 --> 06:19.260
because I think the people that do need to hear that, and do need to see that, are lawmakers

06:19.260 --> 06:24.460
in this country, and look, I understand we got a lot of political opinions here at OLR,

06:24.460 --> 06:30.080
we got a lot of political opinions when it comes to video games, that's fine, and I'm,

06:30.080 --> 06:37.100
I'm really, really not trying to politicize an event, however, this is an event that is

06:37.100 --> 06:45.980
occurring time, and time, and time, and time again, and every time, there's somebody that

06:45.980 --> 06:53.060
always wants to say, it's too soon to talk about all this, now is not the time to politicize

06:53.060 --> 07:02.620
when is the fucking time, time's up, bitch, time's up, because this is continuing to happen,

07:02.620 --> 07:08.660
and what is so, like what makes me numb, what makes me sick, I'm sick, Loki, when I think

07:08.660 --> 07:13.700
about this, I don't know about you, but like, like between the audio, between the thinking of

07:13.700 --> 07:18.260
the fact that I'm about to go to this big convention where there's going to be thousands

07:18.260 --> 07:21.920
of people, and look, I'm not, I'm not trying to knock that convention, it's gonna be a fucking

07:21.960 --> 07:25.840
fantastic convention, I know they work with police, I know security's gonna be beeped up,

07:25.840 --> 07:31.080
but I can't help but think about these things, because this is the society we live in today,

07:31.080 --> 07:40.240
I'm sick, because nothing is going to be done about this, nothing has been done about this,

07:40.240 --> 07:49.920
nothing, nothing, and they're not gonna do anything, I mean, they'll say it, they'll talk

07:49.960 --> 07:53.880
a big game, but no one is ever gonna actually propose anything, or if they do propose something,

07:53.880 --> 07:59.200
it's gonna get shot down by the other side. They shoot, I'm sorry, this, they shoot fucking kids,

07:59.200 --> 08:09.000
kids get shot and nothing is happening, nothing about gun control, nothing about mental health,

08:09.440 --> 08:23.600
somebody come up with a fucking idea and do it, please, because as if the other stuff wasn't that

08:23.600 --> 08:31.400
enough, now this is on the front door of our community, and like, sure, I don't play Madden,

08:31.400 --> 08:36.360
but this is still my community, and they're just gonna use this to push the blame on something

08:36.360 --> 08:39.440
else, because it was a gamer that shot somebody, so it must be the game.

08:39.440 --> 08:44.760
Don't get me started, don't get me started, and that's, that's ultimately, I think, like,

08:44.760 --> 08:50.880
the role that we have to play in this, in some extent, is that we have got to push back when

08:50.880 --> 08:56.640
that narrative comes up, that this is, oh well, it's a video game, no, it is not a video game,

08:56.640 --> 09:00.880
there's so, you guys already know this, if you're downloading a video game podcast,

09:01.320 --> 09:08.720
number one, the video game is a sports game, it's one of the most, if not the most popular sport in

09:08.720 --> 09:18.360
America, as a video game, like, you can't blame, it's another way to do, like, this sport, is it

09:18.360 --> 09:25.240
football's fault? Of course not, it's not the game's fault, so we have to push back on that

09:25.240 --> 09:30.200
narrative, because guess what, you know, this, again, it's happening over and over and over

09:30.200 --> 09:39.520
again, and it's not the game's fault. Now, here's something that, you know, I've kind of thought

09:39.520 --> 09:45.200
about, as I've thought about a lot today, of this particular, you know, incident, and, you know,

09:45.200 --> 09:51.880
what, what can we do from here, where can we go from here? Now, you have to go vote, well, that's

09:51.960 --> 09:58.320
one, that's for fucking sure, like, these people that continue to do nothing need to go, they need

09:58.320 --> 10:06.160
to go, and the only way they're gonna go is if you vote, that's it, like, vote, whatever your ideas

10:06.160 --> 10:13.840
are, vote, but vote for somebody that has ideas, vote for somebody that's gonna do something, and

10:13.840 --> 10:19.320
I think the other thing too is that, and something we have to take a long look at, and I'm not saying

10:19.360 --> 10:22.760
I have the answer to this, I'm not saying you have the answer to this, I'm saying this is something

10:22.760 --> 10:28.520
that, as a community, we have to look at, because there's, again, chatter, and I don't know, Loki,

10:28.520 --> 10:35.840
but this certainly, I hate to say it, but it seems reasonable, well, no, it's not reasonable,

10:35.840 --> 10:43.120
that's, that's a bad word choice, it seems, I hate to use this word, it seems plausible, that

10:43.240 --> 10:50.560
the story about, that he lost a contest earlier in the day, and was so frustrated at the situation,

10:50.560 --> 10:56.160
that he decided this was the way to take it out, I think we have to ask ourselves that question,

10:56.160 --> 11:03.240
why did he come to that conclusion? Is that something in our culture? Is that something

11:03.240 --> 11:08.880
in gaming culture? Is that something in American culture? Is that something in the way he was

11:08.880 --> 11:14.680
raised? I don't know, I don't, I'm not saying I have the answers, but I think these are the

11:14.680 --> 11:19.800
things that we have to take a good, long, hard look at over the next few days, and yes, we do

11:19.800 --> 11:24.840
need to look at it, like, now, and not later, and try to figure out where we're gonna go from here,

11:24.840 --> 11:31.040
because I'm sick of it, you guys, I'm sick of it, I was sick of it a long time ago, but like,

11:31.040 --> 11:37.320
today, now, as, you know, gamers, and as people who talk about video games, it's landed on our

11:37.320 --> 11:42.320
doorstep, and I think a lot of us, unfortunately, whether you want to admit it or not, we're kind

11:42.320 --> 11:47.160
of wondering in the back of your minds, how long was it gonna be for this happen? How long was it

11:47.160 --> 11:51.120
gonna be for this happen at a video game tournament? Because it's been happening in a lot

11:51.120 --> 12:00.760
of places where people gather. Well, that question got answered. Anyway, I do want to go to, I want

12:00.760 --> 12:05.800
to go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, because again, we do tape live Sunday nights,

12:06.440 --> 12:13.720
at the VoiceGeeks Network, vognetwork.com, MXC in chat says, I feel you, Rob, you know, many of us

12:13.720 --> 12:18.600
feel this way, thank you. I do know, it's frustrating, like, there comes this point where

12:18.600 --> 12:22.360
you just start to feel helpless, and I think that's a lot of where my emotion comes from right now,

12:22.360 --> 12:28.800
is like, just this like, helpless feeling, that like, we're being held, our entire political

12:28.800 --> 12:36.880
system is being held captive by this stupid fucking game of heads versus tails, or whatever

12:36.880 --> 12:41.640
you want to call it. You can't take our guns, they're gonna come for our guns. Well, here's,

12:41.640 --> 12:45.000
you know, here's the reality of that situation. Second Amendment, yay. There's a part of me,

12:45.000 --> 12:48.360
Loki, and again, I gotta watch how far down this rabbit hole I go, because I realize there's a lot

12:48.360 --> 12:51.920
of opinions, but here's, here's, here's, here's where my head's at with that. Like, the more and

12:51.920 --> 12:55.140
more that discussion happens, the more and more I kind of want to come to your house and take your

12:55.140 --> 13:02.340
guns. However, however, big however here, I realize that's not possible. Loki, we live in a

13:02.340 --> 13:06.900
world where now, like, you know, technology is a great thing, it's a wonderful thing, but it can

13:06.900 --> 13:11.700
also be a dangerous thing, because now you can 3D print a gun. Remember? Remember that whole ordeal

13:11.700 --> 13:17.940
from a couple weeks ago? They came out with the plans to be able to 3D print a gun, and I think

13:17.940 --> 13:22.180
what happened, what happened to the court system? I apologize, I don't have all my ups and ups on

13:22.180 --> 13:26.500
this, but I believe the court system said, take it off the internet. Basically, you can't have the,

13:26.500 --> 13:31.180
well, of course, what happened, guys? Once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet. So,

13:31.180 --> 13:38.380
if somebody wants to print a gun, they can do it. So, personally, I don't think the answer is taking

13:38.380 --> 13:46.540
guns, because you're just not gonna do it. Now, assault rifles and these, you know, super guns,

13:46.540 --> 13:50.740
these bigger guns, I mean, certainly, I think a question should be asked, who really fucking

13:50.740 --> 13:56.380
needs those? But the reality of the situation is, you know, 20, 25 years, people will probably be

13:56.380 --> 14:01.700
able to print those too. So, I think we need to start to look at a longer term situation than

14:01.700 --> 14:10.780
that. And maybe the question of, why do we have a gun orgy in this country? Why are guns so fucking

14:10.780 --> 14:15.260
glamorous? Why do we want to paint guns? Or sorry, paint guns. Well, I guess you can paint them too.

14:15.460 --> 14:22.900
Why do we want to print guns? Is it, is it really for self-defense? Is it really that? Is there

14:22.900 --> 14:29.220
something else going on there? We're not supposed to. Anyway. Because they told us not to download

14:29.220 --> 14:36.900
cars, and now we're going to download cars. Let's see. SSG100Matt in chat says, I hate guns. I would

14:36.900 --> 14:42.020
never own one. I understand some people's want for one, but I feel that given the way that society is

14:42.020 --> 14:45.220
right now, we have to find a way to control who's getting these guns, not take them away,

14:45.220 --> 14:51.300
control who and how someone gets them. I, I like, there is definitely that part of me that I guess,

14:51.300 --> 14:56.300
yes, liberal tilting side of me that kind of like wants to jump right there with you. But I also

14:56.300 --> 15:01.580
kind of like see this, like, I feel like as technology is getting better 20, 25 down years

15:01.580 --> 15:05.580
down the road, like you, you're not going to be able to stop it. People can make their own guns.

15:05.580 --> 15:12.580
So we have to answer some tougher questions. Why don't you just heavily regulate it now,

15:12.580 --> 15:17.740
and then if it's too much, then you can always back off on it. You know, rules can, they can

15:17.740 --> 15:22.620
change the laws, you know? So if it's not working out one way, they can, they can change laws,

15:22.620 --> 15:26.460
change the law again, but, but they're worried that, oh, they're going to come and steal my

15:26.460 --> 15:34.180
guns. Well, why do you have five AK-47s? You know, why do you have all these assault rifles?

15:34.180 --> 15:40.860
Anyway, I, I'm sure we could talk about this topic alone for the next three hours. That's

15:40.860 --> 15:47.340
not what we're here to do at Orange Launch Radio. Because really, I, I, I, I even kind of question,

15:47.340 --> 15:49.780
like, do I even want to talk about it on the show tonight? But it's like, you have to,

15:49.780 --> 15:53.980
because this is now, it's landed on our doorstep. It's, it's, it's in the gaming community now.

15:53.980 --> 16:00.060
Like, even though this, this story we're talking about really has nothing to do with games,

16:00.060 --> 16:09.420
it kind of does now. And I did ask a question there. Is there something maybe about that

16:09.420 --> 16:14.860
tournament competitive culture? Is there something we could do? I don't know. Maybe the answer is not

16:14.860 --> 16:18.340
really. It's just, there's idiots everywhere, unfortunately. And you're just going to intersect

16:18.340 --> 16:22.580
with them at some point. Just like the people that swatted each other were a $2 bet and they

16:22.580 --> 16:29.100
got someone killed because the cops went to the wrong house, which there's so many bad things that

16:29.140 --> 16:35.180
went on with that scenario. But like, it's, it's just, this is a thing because people think they

16:35.180 --> 16:41.620
can get away with it. Yeah. Because they're, they feel empowered by having something like this and

16:41.620 --> 16:48.140
they're like, I'm going to show them. And they just don't think there's no rational thinking

16:48.140 --> 16:55.940
there. It's just, it's just, I look at me, you know? No, I agree. I don't know the answer,

16:55.980 --> 17:02.940
but I'm sick and tired of nothing happening. So I hope to God something happens soon,

17:02.940 --> 17:09.740
like tomorrow. But unfortunately I'm also accepting the reality. It won't. It won't.

17:09.740 --> 17:17.100
But I will express my opinion with my vote come November. And I hope many of you who are just as

17:17.100 --> 17:25.860
irritated as I am today will do the same. Anyway, video games are something that we use to sometimes

17:25.860 --> 17:32.620
escape our problems. Video games are something that we use to try to better our mood when we've

17:32.620 --> 17:37.340
had a bad day. Sometimes a video game is something I can come to, to make things better. Sometimes I

17:37.340 --> 17:41.580
can get into a story and escape some of these things, take myself out of it for a little bit.

17:41.580 --> 17:46.460
Sometimes I can hang out with friends in a virtual world, slaying orcs or humans, whatever side I

17:46.460 --> 17:51.580
choose. That's the wonderful thing about video games. So we're going to get back to what we do

17:51.580 --> 17:56.140
best and talk a little bit about video games. But, um, thank you for giving me the opportunity to

17:56.140 --> 18:01.140
vent. I think we all need a little bit, a bit of it today, but in the meantime, Loki, let's talk

18:01.140 --> 18:07.220
about what's going on in the video game world. Um, otherwise as the world keeps turning. Um, so our

18:07.220 --> 18:12.420
kickoff topic tonight has a little bit to do with Microsoft and something they've got, uh, planned.

18:12.420 --> 18:16.420
I don't know. Where is this? Loki is this rumor status is something we know they're doing. Where

18:16.420 --> 18:20.140
is this? Something we've talked about before though. Like they would mention, we're thinking

18:20.140 --> 18:26.460
about doing this back in the whole Xbox three 60 days where they were going to go with the whole

18:26.460 --> 18:30.280
subscription model. I don't know if it was with GameStop was thinking about doing it, but it's

18:30.280 --> 18:35.300
been thrown around before where basically you would have monthly payments like, you know, cause

18:35.300 --> 18:40.740
when you go buy, you know, a phone or something like that with your wireless carrier, you pay it

18:40.740 --> 18:46.020
off either in monthly payments or you drop the money upfront and usually you get a little bit of

18:46.020 --> 18:53.540
a discount if you go through their service. So this is basically this all access, um, program,

18:53.540 --> 18:58.820
which is basically going to allow you to make monthly payments. Um, the rumor is that you would

18:58.820 --> 19:08.660
be able to get an Xbox one S, um, along with game pass and, um, Xbox live for $22 per month for two

19:08.660 --> 19:15.220
years. So that'd be your contract, um, portion. And then if you want an Xbox one X, it'd be $35 a

19:15.220 --> 19:20.220
month for two years and you get all those, the Xbox live and the game pass with that.

19:20.220 --> 19:26.780
And it ends up being cheaper than buying all those separately, which is kind of nice. I don't know.

19:26.780 --> 19:30.540
I think it's a great idea. I would totally get on board. It's like, it's like the subsidized cell

19:30.540 --> 19:34.380
phone plan is now hit video games. Although you're right. I don't think it's the first time this has

19:34.380 --> 19:38.740
hit video games. I do remember something about like the Xbox 360, like a whole, like, like,

19:39.740 --> 19:47.100
great idea. I think it's an awesome thing. 35 bucks a month. I mean, it, it's not a lot for,

19:47.100 --> 19:51.420
you know, your normal consumer nowadays who have cell phone plans. Like I remember when I first had

19:51.420 --> 19:56.380
my non smartphone cell phone plan and that was like 50 bucks a month or something. I was like,

19:56.380 --> 20:00.780
Holy shit, this is expensive. I can't imagine someone having to pay for a phone and stuff.

20:00.780 --> 20:04.700
You know, now I have a smartphone and you know, I pay like almost 80 bucks a month for,

20:04.740 --> 20:11.300
you know, paying off the phone and paying for my monthly plan. So it's not a huge deal. It's better

20:11.300 --> 20:16.180
than dropping $600 and then you have to drop money for, you know, Xbox live. Cause you're probably

20:16.180 --> 20:20.580
going to want it anyways. And then the games pass, you can either do with or without, but it's still

20:20.580 --> 20:27.060
a good offer. You know, I think it's a great idea. I'd be curious to see them try it as I think it

20:27.060 --> 20:31.620
would be very successful. Do you think that this might be kind of where this industry is going?

20:31.660 --> 20:34.540
It's part of the reason I wanted to talk about this at the top of the show tonight. It's more

20:34.540 --> 20:40.380
of like a kickoff topic to kind of talk about like, is this maybe where gaming's future as

20:40.380 --> 20:45.820
far as like financial models is headed? Because we know like, look at television, like, you know,

20:45.820 --> 20:52.060
television and cable, especially like it's, it's maybe not there yet where it's like faded,

20:52.060 --> 20:56.380
but I would say, you know, you've got more and more people cutting the cord, fading. A lot of

20:56.380 --> 21:01.420
those cable channels are kind of fading away as more and more people adopt Netflix, who

21:02.260 --> 21:07.620
CBS, CBS on demand and all this other stuff where, you know, now the problem becomes is that you're

21:07.620 --> 21:11.780
paying 10 over here, 10 over here, 10 over here, it starts to add up almost to more cable, but at

21:11.780 --> 21:15.220
least you, you have a little bit more like the picking and choosing of what you're doing there.

21:15.220 --> 21:22.020
So my point is television is kind of going that direction. Meaning movies is also going a similar

21:22.020 --> 21:27.380
direction. I think less and less people are probably buying Blu-rays in favor of being

21:27.380 --> 21:31.700
able to stream movies. Not everybody though. I think with Blu-rays a little different because

21:31.700 --> 21:36.220
you have a lot of movie collectors, you have a lot of movie fans, people that do kind of want to

21:36.220 --> 21:40.420
own it. You know, I think it's a little bit different, but I think you probably have less

21:40.420 --> 21:45.900
people getting into that and more getting into the streaming. For me, I, they don't do deep

21:45.900 --> 21:50.420
enough discounts on the movies themselves, whereas they do that with the game. So I don't get a lot

21:50.420 --> 21:55.060
of stuff on impulse. Whereas I kind of wish it was that way where they would drop stuff down dirt

21:55.100 --> 21:58.780
cheap and be like, Oh, Hey, I want to build up my library of this stuff. But I don't ever see that.

21:58.780 --> 22:03.620
Like I now even check sometimes when they'll do those like games and movie sales on like the

22:03.620 --> 22:06.860
PlayStation store. And I just look at the games. I'm like, Oh yeah, there's a lot of stuff I'd want

22:06.860 --> 22:11.860
to pick up. Cause it's like five bucks. And I look at the movies and like, it was like $15 for an HD

22:11.860 --> 22:20.060
movie. No, no, I'm not going to do that. Um, so I, anyway, with the Blu-rays, the TV, you know,

22:20.060 --> 22:23.420
that's all going kind of this direction where streaming is becoming more and more popular. I

22:23.420 --> 22:29.180
mean, it kind of makes sense that potentially video games is going this way too. I mean, to some

22:29.180 --> 22:35.220
extent, sure. We have PlayStation now we have the, what are they called? Xbox all access, but the

22:35.220 --> 22:40.420
Xbox game pass, the game pass, whatever it's called. Uh, and then I also kind of think the

22:40.420 --> 22:45.980
problem with Microsoft system is it's a little diluted. Now is kind of, I mean, that's it. These

22:45.980 --> 22:48.980
services are kind of like, we kind of look at them and go, well, they're kind of lame because

22:48.980 --> 22:56.340
everything is second game passes, all brand new releases and catalog too. But like, and I like

22:56.340 --> 23:00.660
the fact that I can download that to my system and play it off my system. I have to stream it

23:00.660 --> 23:05.900
because like, you know, if I want to play a game right on this, I can do that on my own separate

23:05.900 --> 23:11.260
TV without taking a bandwidth. Whereas any of my wife's watching some streaming show, that's going

23:11.260 --> 23:17.180
to fuck up there. Forget, you know, there's stupid, uh, PlayStation now. It's not going to

23:17.180 --> 23:24.220
work. Right. And to be fair also with like PlayStation now and the Xbox, uh, game pass, a lot

23:24.220 --> 23:28.060
of the reason why I kind of write both of those off too, is that for me, a lot of the stuff on there

23:28.060 --> 23:32.740
feels kind of very secondhand because it's all stuff that's kind of old, like it's older stuff

23:32.860 --> 23:37.180
coming back to be playable on the systems, which, you know, if you're not playing all the latest

23:37.180 --> 23:41.380
and greatest games, if you're somebody who's more of a casual gamer, who's getting into PlayStation

23:41.380 --> 23:45.180
four, PlayStation three, a little later, whatever, I'm sure those things have a lot more value.

23:45.180 --> 23:49.220
Those things might be really great options, but then of course you bring up their point to that

23:49.340 --> 23:53.580
you have to kind of constantly stream with those where they, that may not be what you want to do.

23:53.580 --> 23:58.460
You might want to have more of the, um, download it all at once and be able to play on demand like

23:58.460 --> 24:02.860
game pass. Let you do. Yeah, I would be like, God damn it. I can't get the Xbox stuff straight.

24:03.020 --> 24:07.220
Game passes the street station. No game pass is the one where you can download stuff. Okay. What's

24:07.220 --> 24:12.300
the other one called PlayStation now? No, what's, what's Microsoft's all access. Well, all access

24:12.300 --> 24:17.100
passes is going to be the one that you get the system. Oh God. All right. Games pass is the one

24:17.100 --> 24:23.580
is basically their Netflix thing. All right. And then Xbox live is Xbox live, but no, seriously.

24:23.580 --> 24:31.660
Um, I think it's a great idea. I, I'd be curious to see how they implement it. Um, yeah. Cause I

24:31.660 --> 24:37.660
mean, it's just, I, I don't know. It just sounds like such a great deal. Um, I mean, especially if

24:37.660 --> 24:40.380
you think about it, like say you're buying this, like you don't have an expert, I don't have an

24:40.380 --> 24:47.020
Xbox. So basically I'm getting an Xbox one X and live, which I pay for anyways, because I need live

24:47.020 --> 24:51.660
if I want to play online. And then I get this instant access to this huge library of games.

24:51.660 --> 24:56.860
I mean, that's a fucking $35 a month. I think it's seriously, they come out with that. That's going

24:56.860 --> 25:02.380
to be so big. Okay. And maybe this is the answer. I think it's going to be a hardware problem

25:02.380 --> 25:05.420
because they're not going to have enough hardware to go around with something like that. Well,

25:05.420 --> 25:09.020
it might, might be some of these limited in quantity or something like they only can sell

25:09.020 --> 25:12.700
as many as they have the hardware for, but that will be Microsoft's thing to figure out.

25:12.700 --> 25:17.180
But in, in regards to, you know, we've been, we've been talking for a couple of years now,

25:17.180 --> 25:20.780
ever since PlayStations really kind of run out in the lead here with PlayStation four,

25:20.780 --> 25:25.660
that Microsoft's going to have to kind of do something big. And my fan wank as to what big

25:25.660 --> 25:29.100
thing are they going to do is that I always said, Oh, they're going to get rid of Xbox live and let

25:29.100 --> 25:33.900
you play online for free. But maybe, maybe no, maybe it's this, this is like their, this is their

25:33.900 --> 25:38.140
big maneuver. Microsoft's going to do this. And this is something that, you know, PlayStation

25:38.140 --> 25:42.780
doesn't really have a model for nor one, I guess that they could really copy easy. I mean, I guess

25:42.780 --> 25:45.980
they could do something with PlayStation now, but again, it's not the same cause you're not really

25:45.980 --> 25:51.100
downloading those games. They really need to come back with a brand new service. It's just, just,

25:51.100 --> 25:56.460
just fucking copy the Xbox service that they have, you know, enable backwards compatibility for

25:56.460 --> 26:00.780
PlayStation three games or whatever you can do. I know that shit can fucking run PlayStation one

26:00.780 --> 26:06.380
games. Okay. The fucking PS3 can run PlayStation one games. So there's no excuses there. Um,

26:06.380 --> 26:11.340
they could come back with something new, have a classic library of free games that you can play

26:11.340 --> 26:15.980
around with, but they got to have something PlayStation. Now they've been trying to push

26:15.980 --> 26:21.020
that for years now. And it's just, I don't think it's taken off. I don't know anybody. It's like,

26:21.020 --> 26:27.020
Oh yeah, PlayStation now going to chat at live.vog network.com. Bobby black Wolf says, uh,

26:27.020 --> 26:33.340
fours of seven is 97 gigs on Xbox one X that's one 10th of my data cap. What about those data

26:33.340 --> 26:37.340
caps? Is that kind of screw this thing up or what do you, what, what kind of interesting

26:37.340 --> 26:41.100
monkey wrench does that put in it? I'm surprised that those games are so big. Like I'm not,

26:41.100 --> 26:46.220
if it's four K true, that's, that's the problem. That's the problem.

26:47.980 --> 26:52.060
I'm fine with that. Cause again, like that you're fine with what I'm not

26:53.100 --> 26:57.900
your data cap getting eaten up. Yeah. I mean, you have to be a little more picky. You don't

26:57.900 --> 27:02.620
have to download those games to play them. It is an option to download and play them offline.

27:02.620 --> 27:10.940
You can stream them as well, but I bet you can't stream it in four K probably my fancy TV. I want

27:10.940 --> 27:14.780
to play my fancy games, but I guess, yeah, I guess there is some decisions to be made. They're

27:14.780 --> 27:21.660
interesting. So, um, uh, yeah. Bobby black old says, yeah, notice I said Xbox one X it's only

27:21.660 --> 27:28.060
60 gigs on the original Xbox one. So that's why it's so big as all the four K. Yeah.

27:28.940 --> 27:33.500
Well, you know, here's the thing though is like with that you can decide that, well,

27:34.140 --> 27:37.260
you're still gonna have to download the patch, even if you buy the disc version of the game,

27:37.260 --> 27:43.020
I guess. So that is a problem. Um, now, uh, the other thing I want to bring up here is

27:43.020 --> 27:47.100
it's really not just Sony and Microsoft in this whole subscription thing. I mean,

27:47.100 --> 27:51.900
we kind of don't know the definitive answers to this yet. And you know, I hate to be a broken

27:51.900 --> 27:57.020
record here on OLR, but we know Nintendo is doing something with the classic NES games and it

27:57.020 --> 28:03.900
appears that it's also going to be a subscription style model where this time the subscription

28:03.900 --> 28:11.420
services Nintendo's online service comes with the classic NES games, which thankfully a 98 gig

28:11.420 --> 28:16.940
download will not be the case with the class. At least I hope not with the classic NES,

28:16.940 --> 28:24.060
unless the code is really badly optimized. It's it's so late though. I mean, it's,

28:24.060 --> 28:30.860
is it though, considering that Sony's system is not, does not have a download it and play? I mean,

28:30.860 --> 28:35.580
sure with the, with Nintendo switch, it's all going to be, it's all going to be classic games

28:35.580 --> 28:42.940
or is it, you know, again, we're still expecting Nintendo to do this big unveil of Nintendo online

28:42.940 --> 28:46.940
where I'm starting to worry more and more that now now social media drip feed is all we're going to

28:46.940 --> 28:54.460
get, but maybe Nintendo might, might do something like this too. Take those expectations and bring

28:54.460 --> 29:00.540
them way down. I'm telling you it's, it's not going to be anything. They're not expectations.

29:00.540 --> 29:04.540
That's the beautiful thing. Loki is I've learned with the Nintendo to expect nothing when it comes

29:04.540 --> 29:13.420
to online. And now I get pleasantly surprised. It's just, it's, I am expecting so little with

29:13.420 --> 29:17.100
that. And especially for the price, I wouldn't expect anything more than just any S games,

29:17.100 --> 29:22.220
maybe, Ooh, maybe asking me games. Honestly, they should just say, fuck it with their whole system.

29:22.220 --> 29:26.380
Anyways, they can do like the, where he paid so much a month, you can get a library games, but

29:26.380 --> 29:29.580
just put the fucking virtual console out there. I mean, come on, you're fucking making these games

29:29.580 --> 29:35.100
anyways, just put it out there so we can purchase the games. Why you have to be fucking difficult

29:35.100 --> 29:40.220
with it? Well, if I'm not mistaken, because the switch is on different hardware, maybe some of

29:40.220 --> 29:44.700
the tricks they did before is not going to work again. I mean, here's the thing they might do.

29:45.500 --> 29:50.860
Except that homebrew people can run those games just fucking fine. So apparently the hardware

29:50.860 --> 29:55.340
can handle it. And I mean, it's, it's basically a Tegra chip anyways, which we know that shit can

29:55.340 --> 30:03.340
run Wii games. Thank you to the Chinese, um, Nvidia shields. Um, so it can fucking handle

30:03.340 --> 30:08.060
that. It's just, they're just being stupid about it. And here's the thing. Like I have no problem.

30:08.060 --> 30:14.060
Like you don't have to support multiplayer in all the games. Cause guess what? You have

30:14.780 --> 30:19.900
a marketplace that can patch games. So when you add it to, you can patch it in. There's also a lot

30:19.900 --> 30:23.980
of games that just straight up don't need it. Like star tropics does not need two player mode.

30:23.980 --> 30:28.700
Exactly. Just patch it in later. If that's really what you want to do. I don't see the big problem

30:28.700 --> 30:34.060
with that. Like sell the game like, Hey, multiplayer coming out later on. Who cares?

30:34.140 --> 30:40.140
It's a fucking NES game. Oh no. Multiplayer. I haven't played this game in like a billion

30:40.140 --> 30:45.660
times already. I just don't see the problem. Why can't they can't put out more of these games,

30:45.660 --> 30:50.060
especially their own games. Okay. I understand licensing and stuff with third party games and

30:50.060 --> 30:54.860
that's, that's fine, but come on, you can fucking do better than that. Look, I mean,

30:54.860 --> 30:59.580
I am excited at the potential of playing the multiplayer NES games online across a great

30:59.580 --> 31:03.820
distance. Like I just know, and I don't know if Delvin's out there listening, but I just know

31:04.540 --> 31:08.300
we're going to beat the shit out of each other in Super Mario Brothers three. Like that is the

31:08.300 --> 31:13.660
thing that's going to happen across the wonderful internet. And we don't have to be in the same room

31:13.660 --> 31:18.940
for me to click on his icon on the world map and then steal all his items or whatever it was you

31:18.940 --> 31:22.620
do in that game. That was the thing you did, right? Didn't on the map, you would, you'd

31:22.620 --> 31:25.660
click on the other player and then you wouldn't do it like a battle thing, right? Like it was

31:25.660 --> 31:32.140
original. It was original Mario Brothers, right? So that's the thing that now gets to happen across

31:32.140 --> 31:37.180
the internet. And then hopefully even better, maybe we'll stream it for everyone. For example,

31:37.180 --> 31:42.540
like Sega ages has, um, games coming out on the switch and they've done enhancements for those,

31:42.540 --> 31:49.100
like for example, fantasy star has a map feature that it draws a map for you because before it

31:49.100 --> 31:52.460
used to be hard to navigate through the game because there's no map. So they had, they added

31:52.460 --> 31:56.540
that in there as part of a new thing that they patched in. So there's things that they can do

31:56.540 --> 32:01.900
that enhance these games, but they don't have to do it. They can just put them out there. Like,

32:01.900 --> 32:06.620
did that, Oh, did the lack of multiplayer and stuff really stop, you know, selling those games

32:06.620 --> 32:13.740
on the Wii or anything? No. Or on the Wii U? No. 3DS? No. Just put them out again. You'll sell them

32:13.740 --> 32:20.220
again. No one cares. Uh, Dartusia in chat says, Oh yeah, I heard the fantasy star map feature is huge.

32:20.220 --> 32:23.820
I never got to play the original personally, but I imagine that being a huge help. Oh yeah,

32:23.820 --> 32:29.740
I'm sure. For sure. All right. Anyhow, uh, subscriptions. It'll be interesting to see

32:29.740 --> 32:33.340
where that takes the industry in a few years. I wonder when we'll hear about that.

32:34.300 --> 32:37.980
I'm not, I'm not talking about just Nintendo. It's like, what, how many like four weeks away?

32:38.860 --> 32:43.740
We'll see. We'll see the day before Loki, we already answered this the day with the day before

32:43.740 --> 32:48.700
they they're ready to do direct. Actually, I take that back because I think Nintendo announced a

32:48.780 --> 32:53.180
Nindies direct, correct me if I'm wrong chat, but I think they gave us five days notice

32:53.180 --> 32:58.540
on a Nindies direct that's early next week. So that'll be like all the, probably the rest of the

32:58.540 --> 33:03.260
more indie releases for the year. But you know, sometimes Indies, um, has some, you know, big

33:03.260 --> 33:09.900
surprises in there. So yeah, Nindies. So I forget when exactly that direct is, but I think it's

33:09.900 --> 33:13.900
sometime next week and they gave us five days notice and I was like, wow, that's some big

33:13.900 --> 33:17.660
advance notice. I know a hat in time's coming and that's going to be, that's going to be a

33:17.660 --> 33:25.260
good game for the switch, I think. But, um, I don't know. I just, I under, I'm expecting to

33:25.260 --> 33:30.940
be underwhelmed, whatever. That's fine because I expect it. And so I'm sure that it'll meet my

33:30.940 --> 33:37.660
expectations. All right. Thank you. JD clarifies it is Tuesday at 9.00 AM Pacific. That is it.

33:37.660 --> 33:42.060
So, uh, by black Wolf, uh, in chat says, I don't think they need to announce anything until the day

33:42.060 --> 33:47.340
they launch continues to say nobody ever said, well, I would get online, but I'm mad that they

33:47.340 --> 33:50.700
didn't tell me this four weeks ago. No, they do need to announce it because they're taking

33:50.700 --> 33:55.420
pre-orders on the goddamn thing. So I think that we should know exactly what we're paying for.

33:55.420 --> 34:00.460
I, I, yeah, I sorta get your point, Bobby, but at the same time, they are going to be asking us to

34:00.460 --> 34:03.500
kind of like commit to this. And I think a lot of us kind of want to know, okay, what is it that

34:03.500 --> 34:10.220
we're paying for? And if they want this to be big day one, if they want this to be like an event

34:10.220 --> 34:14.300
thing, which I always kind of thought most things of video games really tried to get everything out

34:14.300 --> 34:19.580
the door on day one. Hence why we have pre-orders of games and everything. Then I would think they'd

34:19.580 --> 34:24.620
give at least like a little notice, but maybe they just feel that because they already know these

34:24.620 --> 34:28.460
people are playing Splatoon two online. These people play Mario Kart online. They're going to

34:28.460 --> 34:32.940
have to pay up to keep doing it online. So maybe Nintendo is just kind of banking on that. I don't

34:32.940 --> 34:37.740
know. No. All right. Anyway, their online service better be good because you're gonna hear people

34:37.740 --> 34:43.020
going, well, I'm paying for this shit and it fucking sucks. So just saying, prepare for that

34:43.020 --> 34:47.260
Nintendo. All right, let's move on. Let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks and the types

34:47.260 --> 34:50.460
of video games that we've been playing this week. Loki, how was your gaming week? I haven't played a

34:50.460 --> 34:54.940
whole ton of console stuff. Um, well actually I haven't played any console stuff really. It was

34:54.940 --> 35:03.340
mostly just, um, Pokemon go and I'm fucking pissed off at the app right now because it's just all

35:03.340 --> 35:10.060
sorts of broken. They patched it recently and it just screwed everything up since then it's,

35:10.060 --> 35:16.220
you know, lagged out like really bad. It's freezes. Every time I enter exit my either

35:16.220 --> 35:23.020
like I changed from, you know, wifi connection to, you know, LTE or if it, you know, goes from

35:23.660 --> 35:28.140
playing, it doesn't even play audio through my speakers because I have the audio turned off, but

35:28.140 --> 35:32.620
going from being connected to my Bluetooth to not being connected to my Bluetooth,

35:32.940 --> 35:38.700
it freezes the game completely for 30 seconds. It's fucking dumb. This, this never happened

35:38.700 --> 35:44.060
before. And then like there's sometimes I'll go to lunch and I'll let it just, you know,

35:44.060 --> 35:48.220
cause I'm driving through a parking lot, so I'll let it collect, you know, some kilometers that way

35:48.220 --> 35:52.220
and it come back and the phone feels like that the battery is literally going to explode because it's

35:52.220 --> 35:59.660
so fucking hot. I'm like, why the hell did there's nothing going on at this game? It's just like,

35:59.660 --> 36:03.660
what the hell did you do? Like basic functionality doesn't work. Like I can't spin

36:03.660 --> 36:07.340
pokey stuff. Sometimes I'll be sitting right there. I'll spin it. And it's like, try again

36:07.340 --> 36:12.780
later or, you know, I have great data because I know cause I'm still being able to catch stuff

36:12.780 --> 36:17.340
or I'll try to catch things. I had one where there's a Pokemon that spawned and disappeared

36:17.340 --> 36:23.100
immediately. I was like, what the fuck was that? I have that problem sometimes on a iPhone. I think

36:23.100 --> 36:27.580
it's like distance really. Cause what I noticed is that my, my character will slingshot like as

36:27.580 --> 36:32.540
the GPS tries to correct itself to the correct location. And so now suddenly my phone thinks

36:32.540 --> 36:36.460
I'm driving. So it shuts off the Pokemon for a few seconds before they come right back.

36:37.260 --> 36:43.100
So I, it is, it is weird because they have it in order to do the animation, they have it chasing

36:43.100 --> 36:47.820
the GPS coordinates. So your character is chasing it, but they calculate everything based on the

36:47.820 --> 36:52.380
distance of your character, not where your fucking GPS is because that makes all goddamn sense.

36:52.380 --> 36:59.260
Um, well, you know, I, I know they just updated it on iOS and a lot of people were having problems

36:59.260 --> 37:03.340
like even getting the game launched when the update happened. So people just deleted the

37:03.340 --> 37:07.820
app and reinstalled and now it works fine. So you might want to try that. I mean, you're on Android,

37:07.820 --> 37:12.700
so I haven't heard of that, but I think in general, turning it off and then on again is

37:12.700 --> 37:17.660
always good. I also had the issue too, where like it does this weird random, like rotates the camera

37:17.660 --> 37:23.660
around to meet the Pokemon, which never happened before. Um, I don't know. It's just silly stuff

37:23.660 --> 37:30.140
like that, but, so it's a little bit pissing me off. Um, but I'm still been playing each, oh,

37:30.140 --> 37:36.620
and like, I mean, I know it's random, but like the other day I was trying to get gifts to send

37:36.620 --> 37:43.340
the people. And I literally like, I threw away 50 Poke balls and I spun like a good 15 Poke stops.

37:43.340 --> 37:47.500
Still have to throw away another 50 balls after that and no fucking gifts,

37:48.220 --> 37:52.860
none. It's just like, where'd your balls go, Loki? It's like three. Like I'm like, I have all these

37:52.860 --> 37:57.260
like common Poke balls and stuff. I'm like, I don't fucking need these. I can't catch anything

37:57.260 --> 38:04.940
with these. Like nothing will go in these balls. I have the, I have the other balls that I could

38:04.940 --> 38:11.980
use, but I'm, I'm, I'm refraining from saying blue balls. So we're not going to walk into that.

38:11.980 --> 38:18.220
Uh, it's for the best, but you know, it's just, it's just bullshit. Like sometimes like,

38:19.420 --> 38:22.860
I don't know why they make certain Pokemon like insanely hard to catch. Like,

38:23.420 --> 38:26.860
like there's some of the rotatas that just keep like jumping. I'm like, I don't even fucking

38:26.860 --> 38:31.740
want you. I just have to use up this inventory. So I have room for other shit and I'm just going

38:31.740 --> 38:36.540
to cover experience or rotata. Nobody wants you, you know what fucking wants you or the like

38:36.540 --> 38:43.020
stupid like torture or whatever the fucking like lantern flower thing. I'm like, I don't fucking

38:43.020 --> 38:50.140
want you. Why are you so goddamn hard to catch? You're completely fucking useless. So basically

38:50.140 --> 38:55.820
that and dance dance revolution extreme. I have been working more in, um, well still in unreal.

38:55.820 --> 39:00.300
I've been working through some other tutorials, learn more about like the third person controller

39:00.300 --> 39:05.980
and stuff like that. And just some of the things with, with that in, um, I don't know.

39:05.980 --> 39:11.260
I'm just messing around, still trying to learn things. Um, it's pretty much it. Cause it's,

39:11.260 --> 39:15.340
a lot of the lessons, unfortunately they have online tutorials are basically covering the

39:15.340 --> 39:20.060
same stuff and it's hard to find new material that kind of covers things that haven't gone

39:20.060 --> 39:27.260
through yet. So I'm just checking things out and experimenting. So that's pretty much it.

39:28.220 --> 39:34.860
Okay. Uh, let's see my gaming week. Um, not a lot of like new stuff. I'm still just,

39:34.860 --> 39:38.620
I'm, I feel like I'm in this lull before all these games start to come out. Like,

39:38.620 --> 39:42.940
I think the first big game I'm looking forward to is in a couple of weeks. We have dragon quest 11

39:42.940 --> 39:46.700
is out like the first week of September, probably when I get back from dragon con.

39:46.700 --> 39:51.420
So, uh, that's exciting, but, uh, yeah, otherwise I'm continuing to just kind of play stuff on PC,

39:51.420 --> 39:55.580
like final fantasy 14. So I've been making some progress in that just, uh, enjoying some of the

39:55.580 --> 40:01.020
end game, uh, playing heroes of the storm. Um, who was the latest character I just bought? Oh,

40:01.020 --> 40:05.420
I just bought the new one. They put out white main. I bought her, I saved up 15,000 gold,

40:05.420 --> 40:10.460
which is a lot of, which a lot of AI matches. Keep in mind, I played like 98% AI matches.

40:10.460 --> 40:14.860
So, uh, I finally saved up the gold to get white main and I've been playing with her a little bit

40:14.860 --> 40:19.260
and yeah, she's kind of a different type of healer. Uh, and her attacks are really weird.

40:19.260 --> 40:22.380
So that's been kind of fun to play. So even though I bought her though, I've been playing more and

40:22.380 --> 40:26.220
more would just like experimenting with, with like other characters and trying to find stuff

40:26.220 --> 40:29.740
that I like. I'm trying to think of what that character was that I was playing yesterday that

40:29.740 --> 40:34.940
I'd barely ever played. And I found that I really liked playing them, not arbiter, but one of the

40:34.940 --> 40:38.780
other star craft characters is like a tank that does a little charge move that goes back and

40:38.780 --> 40:42.380
forth. I can't even think of the name now. Maybe somebody in chat knows, but that's, uh, that's the

40:42.380 --> 40:48.620
character I like to play, uh, right now. Um, and chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Ryan says,

40:48.620 --> 40:53.740
white main is super good at heals in the meta now. Oh, Artanis. That's it. Artanis is the one

40:53.740 --> 40:58.940
I'm really enjoying playing right now. Uh, thank you, Ryan. Uh, and then they're asking Phoenix.

40:58.940 --> 41:03.900
I said, Phoenix. Phoenix. I like Phoenix. Phoenix does the little circle laser thing. He goes,

41:03.900 --> 41:07.420
like draws a little circle laser. That's kind of fun to play cause you can kind of control the

41:07.420 --> 41:11.420
radius of that. So it's kind of like a different type of character, but yeah. Um, the, the one

41:11.420 --> 41:15.260
I've been playing a lot of matches with lately is Artanis. And then, uh, I don't know why I've,

41:15.260 --> 41:18.860
I've been like playing all these Starcraft characters. I've been playing Tassadar

41:18.860 --> 41:22.460
is the other one. I got a really cool skin that looks like an Egyptian type of like

41:22.460 --> 41:28.140
mummified thing for, um, Tassadar. And, uh, I really like he's supposedly it's,

41:28.140 --> 41:35.020
he's supposedly a healer, but like he does like a shield. And if you get hit when the shield is

41:35.020 --> 41:39.740
on you, then you get some health back. It's not the most effective heal in the world, but like,

41:39.740 --> 41:44.700
he's really good at burning lanes. Cause you can do the whole little, um, um, thing on the ground

41:44.700 --> 41:48.060
that does the thunderstorm and yeah, that's the way I kind of like to build. So he's a good,

41:48.060 --> 41:52.780
like, I like the guys that can kind of lane on their own. That's why I really like Sylvanas.

41:52.780 --> 41:56.860
I like Hanzo cause you can kind of like really burn down lanes on your own with those characters.

41:56.860 --> 42:01.660
And those are, those are kind of fun to play. So anyway, uh, cool. I didn't realize we have

42:01.660 --> 42:04.780
quite a few heroes, the storm players, cause some folks in chat are talking to the bonds.

42:04.780 --> 42:09.820
Double six says I always lean towards the Starcraft players. Um, and, uh, Ryan also

42:09.820 --> 42:14.860
clarifying that, uh, white main is super good at heals in the meta now. Yeah. I hear she's

42:14.860 --> 42:20.860
pretty good at heals. Uh, bonds double six says white main is good to heal tank. Awesome. So,

42:20.860 --> 42:29.740
um, let's see. And I've also been, uh, enjoying, um, Pokemon go. I'm still playing. Um, I don't

42:29.740 --> 42:33.820
have quite the frustrations that Loki has been having. Of course I'm on iPhone. That's not to

42:33.820 --> 42:37.900
say it's not perfect. I was having a day or two where I'm like, God, I've spun like a million

42:37.900 --> 42:42.540
stops and I'm not getting any gifts, but I think it's just one of those. Some days you have good

42:42.540 --> 42:47.100
luck. Some days you don't today. Um, Alan and I decided to go for a walk. So we went to the,

42:47.100 --> 42:50.860
the chicken park closer to your, where your neck of the woods. We went over to the chicken park

42:50.860 --> 42:56.220
and just walked around. I got a good 20 gifts to send out. Yeah. There's tons of stops over there.

42:56.220 --> 43:00.620
Yeah. So we, we like to go, we'd like to go there. We'd like to go to Sac state, the university.

43:00.620 --> 43:05.340
We'd like to go downtown, walk the Capitol park. Uh, it's just hard to park down there sometimes.

43:05.340 --> 43:08.700
Uh, so those are like, but like community today, well, we always go to Capitol park

43:08.700 --> 43:11.580
at some point. We'll probably go up to Palladio, even though that's a ways away from here,

43:11.580 --> 43:15.580
but like, these are all the places around town. Like there's concentrated pokey stops and

43:15.580 --> 43:19.100
yeah, you can just kind of, and I like to just play with the gotcha so I could just walk. I

43:19.100 --> 43:22.940
could do, you know, my power walk in and my gotcha is just doing everything and spinning all the

43:22.940 --> 43:28.140
stops. And then like maybe every lap I'll stop, send out gifts to friends and then keep going.

43:28.700 --> 43:34.940
So yeah, but my friends list, uh, that, that quest, man, now I'm getting more people adding

43:34.940 --> 43:40.620
me cause that quest that makes you add three people. So I haven't gotten that yet. There'll

43:40.620 --> 43:45.100
be a quest in the celibate thing where you have to add three people. So you have to make three

43:45.100 --> 43:48.860
new friends. So I'm sure that people out there willing to be like, you read the fine print,

43:48.860 --> 43:57.260
you gotta refer three people to Ingress. What? Yeah. Right. Um, so, uh, I, uh, I have 108 people

43:57.260 --> 44:01.660
on my friend. No, I have 110 people on my friends list, which is, I love having tons of friends,

44:01.660 --> 44:06.140
but don't have Bobby as a friend. The problem is I said no audio. God damn it.

44:06.140 --> 44:11.580
Maybe he doesn't want to be your friend. Okay. Anyway, well that wouldn't be surprising

44:11.580 --> 44:18.220
anyway. No. Uh, but the thing is, is that that's, I can't spend that many gifts in a day. I cannot

44:18.220 --> 44:23.900
get that many gifts. That's too many gifts. Right. And then you can only open 21 and, or no 20,

44:23.900 --> 44:28.540
not even 20 when you don't open 20. So it's like, I have to kind of pick and choose and it really

44:28.540 --> 44:32.780
sucks. Cause then it's like, Oh, I feel like this person probably thinks I hate them, but

44:32.780 --> 44:37.100
no, it's just the person that I keep. If I keep going down the list, it's like the person I always

44:37.100 --> 44:42.940
end up on. I think today it was Bobby's wife. Actually I went to open Bobby's wife's gift and

44:42.940 --> 44:46.380
that was the one where I got the message that said, you've opened too many gifts today. And

44:46.380 --> 44:49.340
I was like, Oh, she's going to think I don't like her. And I'm going to see her in three days.

44:50.620 --> 44:56.780
How dare you open? So I'm like, I guess I'll have to do another lap around the park so I can send

44:56.780 --> 45:03.900
one. So at least it's walking incentive. All right. Uh, I guess that's really it for my gaming

45:03.900 --> 45:09.340
week. So, um, yeah, so I'm hoping, uh, by the time we're back live again in two weeks, uh,

45:09.340 --> 45:13.340
I'll have some new stuff. Cause I think Dragon Quest 11 is out by then, uh, along with some

45:13.340 --> 45:18.620
other stuff too. Uh, anyhow, let's get to housekeeping. So there will be no show next week

45:18.620 --> 45:24.620
live, uh, or taped because I will be at Dragon Con in Atlanta. And if you don't know Dragon Con,

45:24.620 --> 45:29.340
it's a, I've been going for years. So I've talked about it here on the show. Uh, it's a lot of fun.

45:29.340 --> 45:33.660
It's like, imagine 24 different conventions all happening at once. That's basically,

45:33.660 --> 45:37.340
and maybe give or take a few on the number. That's basically what Dragon Con is. You have all these

45:37.340 --> 45:42.380
different tracks that take up different hotel ballrooms and different things. Um, and so if

45:42.380 --> 45:49.180
you just want to spend the entire fucking Dragon Con in the space. Track where you, where they have

45:49.180 --> 45:54.220
people from NASA that come in and talk and they talk about space. Like I would not fucking blame

45:54.220 --> 45:58.780
you for that. And you would have an amazing time at the convention. But you know, if you're me

45:58.780 --> 46:04.540
and you're like, I like podcasting and I like video games, then you kind of tend to go back

46:04.540 --> 46:09.340
and forth and, and it's the costume track that does the really good dance party. I want to go

46:09.340 --> 46:13.420
to, you kind of end up floating around different stuff. So you can kind of, it's, it's like getting

46:13.420 --> 46:18.460
the sampler platter at Denny's, but with a convention, actually not Denny's because their

46:18.460 --> 46:24.060
food is shit. It's like getting the sampler platter. What's a restaurant with a good sampler platter?

46:24.220 --> 46:30.860
No, I don't know. What is it? All the, all the places that are coming to mind like closed. I'm

46:30.860 --> 46:34.940
like the sample platter at Caro's. Wait, no. Uh, the sample platter at Epi's. No, wait, they're

46:34.940 --> 46:41.500
gone too. God damn it. Okay. Yes. Bobby Black Wolf, a Brazilian steakhouse. I like that.

46:43.100 --> 46:47.980
They bring by the panels on a big sword and they slice off. Would you like to go to this panel?

46:47.980 --> 46:53.020
But anyway, besides just that, you could probably also have a very rewarding, great time not going

46:53.020 --> 46:58.620
to any fucking panels. Uh, many people just like to kind of walk around the halls, check out the

46:58.620 --> 47:04.700
cosplay, meet up with friends, drink a little bit. Um, if you don't want to head out and go watch the

47:04.700 --> 47:09.900
parade and things like that, they have a closed circuit TV station that runs on all the host

47:09.900 --> 47:14.380
hotels, have this special TV station called dragon con TV that broadcasts all this stuff.

47:14.380 --> 47:18.220
So it's really cool. And you can actually get that online now so you can get to the dragon

47:18.300 --> 47:23.500
con TV. Yeah, it's pretty cool. So, uh, well it's pay for it, but you know, well, the money goes

47:23.500 --> 47:27.820
back to the convention to support and all that good stuff. You know, it ain't nothing for free

47:27.820 --> 47:32.620
Loki. Anyway, uh, speaking of panels, I do hope you will check out some panels this year because,

47:32.620 --> 47:37.100
um, I am going to be a part of eight different panels at dragon con this year. I want to tell

47:37.100 --> 47:41.100
you really quickly, uh, where you can find me at dragon con. I do hope you will be there in Atlanta.

47:41.100 --> 47:47.420
If you are in the area, come say hello at one of these panels. So Friday at 10 AM, uh, I will be

47:47.420 --> 47:53.340
doing a panel called meet the cast mass effect. And I'm really excited about this as a panel with

47:53.340 --> 47:59.580
DC Douglas, Mark Muir and Courtney Taylor, uh, all from the mass effect series, uh, the voice actors

47:59.580 --> 48:03.340
and actresses. And we're going to talk a little bit about mass effect and like, you know, all

48:03.340 --> 48:08.300
these years later, how there are going to still be tons and tons of people dressing up in mass effect

48:08.300 --> 48:14.860
costumes and what that means and how they feel about all that. Um, and even, uh, my pod daddy,

48:14.860 --> 48:18.780
uh, Travis Donovan is making his triumphant return to dragon con this year. And I'm sure

48:18.780 --> 48:22.460
he's going to wear something in seven related too. So I'll, I'll have to be sure to ask about

48:22.460 --> 48:29.660
my pod daddy. Uh, anyway, speaking of podcasting Friday at 7 PM, I'll be on a panel called

48:29.660 --> 48:35.740
interaction in real time, the art of live podcasting. And the description actually says

48:35.740 --> 48:40.300
Bobby Black Wolf and Rob Roberts of the voice geeks network have been doing their podcast live

48:40.300 --> 48:46.220
since the early two thousands before it was easy. I don't know. The life she's five software wasn't

48:46.220 --> 48:50.060
complicated, but you're right. It was very different back then. So, uh, we'll be talking

48:50.060 --> 48:56.460
all about, you mean it did it without a Patreon. Well, shush the live pot. We'll see. The thing is

48:56.460 --> 49:03.260
live podcasting is like back now. So like it was the only thing you did before then it was like,

49:03.260 --> 49:08.380
well, it's not really a podcast. If you're doing it live, that's not really a podcast. That's just

49:08.380 --> 49:16.140
a taped life. Stop anyway. But now we're back to live podcast because of things like Twitch

49:16.140 --> 49:20.220
and YouTube and YouTube live and all this stuff that people are doing. So, uh, that is,

49:20.220 --> 49:24.860
uh, something we'll talk about is, is the art of live podcasting. I will be a judge on a panel

49:24.860 --> 49:31.020
called pod tank pitch your podcast. So yes, it's basically like shark tank, but for podcasts,

49:31.020 --> 49:35.100
we will hear pitches and we will give feedback. And if you want to know if I'm going to be the

49:35.100 --> 49:39.900
Paula Abdul or the Simon Cowell of the panel, you'll just have to attend. That's 10 o'clock

49:39.900 --> 49:45.900
on Friday. Then Saturday. Now the listeners of OLR are going to understand why this is hilarious.

49:46.540 --> 49:52.780
I'm going to be moderating a panel called Saturday at one o'clock. Let's play five nights

49:52.780 --> 50:01.660
at Freddy's sister location. Why are you laughing? Loki? Cause you love horror games.

50:02.460 --> 50:07.420
So if you don't already know when I play horror games on Twitch, as I've done here and there,

50:08.060 --> 50:13.740
I scream and I scream loudly because jump scares scare the fucking hell out of me. Well,

50:13.740 --> 50:19.500
five nights at Freddy's is a game about nothing but jump scares. So this is going to be something

50:19.500 --> 50:24.620
anyway. Um, they actually asked if I wanted to play the game while I moderated and I politely

50:24.620 --> 50:30.700
declined. Um, so I believe this speaker, um, and I'm, I hope I'm saying the name right. Panina.

50:30.700 --> 50:33.980
I hope I'm saying that right. I'm so sorry if I'm saying that wrong, but, um, I will hopefully

50:33.980 --> 50:37.580
meet this person soon. Uh, they, I believe are the ones that are going to be playing the game,

50:37.580 --> 50:43.500
uh, while we have in the, in the panel, Kellen Goff, Heather masters and Julie shields,

50:43.500 --> 50:48.620
because did you know that, um, this, uh, five nights at Freddy's sister location has way more

50:48.620 --> 50:52.860
voice acting than the other games. So these are voice actors from this game. So we'll,

50:52.860 --> 50:56.540
we'll kind of hear some stories about what all went into that while we do the panel,

50:57.420 --> 51:01.740
uh, Saturday at two 30, uh, that'd be Saturday, September 1st at two 30

51:01.740 --> 51:06.540
broadcasting in podcasting. We're going to talk a little bit about broadcasting best practices

51:06.540 --> 51:11.580
and what can be used with that in podcasting and online media. It's a panel full of veteran

51:11.580 --> 51:17.340
broadcasters, including, uh, myself, uh, Justin, Robert Young is on that panel. Jay Patrick,

51:17.340 --> 51:22.780
Roberto Blake, Ethan C and Mr. Charles McFall from the Pokemon go podcast. That will be very

51:22.780 --> 51:29.740
exciting. So, uh, lots of great folks on that panel Saturday at four o'clock, I will be,

51:29.740 --> 51:34.940
this is a two person panel. It's me and one other person. You ready for this Twitch one Oh one.

51:35.740 --> 51:39.820
I, I, I am honored that I'm being asked to do this when I'm not even a partner,

51:39.820 --> 51:45.580
I'm just an affiliate, but I will be moderating this panel Twitch one Oh one, uh, with Caroline.

51:45.580 --> 51:51.020
She is a engineer over at Twitch. And we're going to talk a little bit about what you need to do to

51:51.020 --> 51:54.460
get started. And so talk a little bit about it's Twitch one Oh one y'all, we're gonna talk about

51:54.460 --> 51:59.260
the basics of Twitch. So that'll be a fun panel. Uh, I'm not done yet. Sorry. This is boring,

51:59.260 --> 52:03.900
but I'm really excited for all these panels. So I've got two more, uh, social media for

52:03.900 --> 52:09.900
digital creators is Saturday at seven o'clock. And we'll be talking about Twitter, Tumblr,

52:09.900 --> 52:14.620
coffee, Facebook, Instagram, all these social media outlets, all these places you can promote

52:14.620 --> 52:20.060
your show. Yes. Loki, Patrion too. We'll talk about all these places and how to pick what's

52:20.060 --> 52:25.260
right for you because for some people, Loki, Patrion may not be right for you,

52:25.260 --> 52:28.300
but for other people, it may be right for them. It just depends on what they're trying to do.

52:28.940 --> 52:35.260
And then lastly, here's the last panel I'm doing Sunday, two 30 PM in the Western peach tree,

52:35.260 --> 52:40.460
sorry, the Western peach tree ballroom. Logan is a huge room. This is one of like the biggest rooms,

52:41.340 --> 52:47.260
the Overwatch voice actor Q and a, I am so honored to be doing this one with, um,

52:47.260 --> 52:53.740
Anjali Bhimani, the voice of Anna, if I remember right, Charlotte Chung, the voice of diva and

52:53.740 --> 53:00.780
Lucy poll, the voice of mercy are all going to be on that panel with little old me, uh, Overwatch.

53:00.780 --> 53:05.740
So we're going to talk about that. And just how Overwatch has gotten so big with e-sports. I'm

53:05.740 --> 53:10.700
really curious. I want to know if they like watch the e-sports events and how it feels to kind of

53:10.700 --> 53:15.340
be like a voice, like in those e-sports I kind of, I'm really curious on their take on like,

53:15.340 --> 53:18.860
did they ever think when they were recording these lines that, Oh my gosh, it was going to

53:18.860 --> 53:23.180
be like this huge, like sporting event that's filling arenas, the Barclay center and stuff.

53:23.180 --> 53:28.940
So I'm really excited to see. And then of course I have to ask the voice of mercy. I have to ask

53:28.940 --> 53:34.300
how it feels to have her character retooled every six months. I have to think of a taxable way to

53:34.300 --> 53:39.980
ask that. So there you go. Anyway. Uh, anyway, if you're going to be at, uh, dragon con, please

53:39.980 --> 53:45.660
check out one of those panels. If you're not going to be at dragon con, they may be doing some

53:45.660 --> 53:51.180
streaming of the panels. Uh, the podcasting ones anyway, maybe streamed online. I promise I will

53:51.180 --> 53:54.940
have up to the minute information on my Twitter. So if you're not following me on Twitter, you

53:54.940 --> 54:00.460
should think about doing that twitter.com slash Mr. Rob Roberts or at Mr. Rob Roberts. That's MR

54:00.460 --> 54:04.380
Rob Roberts is where you can find me over on Twitter and I'll give you all the latest and

54:04.380 --> 54:09.340
greatest over there. So, and also, yes, thank you, Bobby, for letting, reminding me, we have

54:09.340 --> 54:13.820
a special discord channel in the vog network discord for dragon con. That will be where we

54:13.820 --> 54:18.700
will post video or maybe video, I don't know, photos for sure though. Uh, and all that stuff.

54:18.700 --> 54:25.020
So especially as we have, uh, Bobby is going to turn our hotel room into the VR suite again,

54:25.020 --> 54:29.820
where I'm sure we will be playing much beat saber and that will be, I'm sure, uh, pictured. And

54:29.820 --> 54:33.900
those will go to our discord channels. If you're not on our discord yet, check it out.

54:33.900 --> 54:41.260
vog network.com slash discord. Um, SSG, 100 mountain chat says somewhere grandpa from

54:41.260 --> 54:46.860
hoard house is like Rob's ego is going to be bigger than insert rude, inappropriate comment.

54:46.860 --> 54:52.140
Um, I am like, so I I'm so honored and humbled that I'm being asked to do these panels. I'm like,

54:52.140 --> 54:56.380
I'm, I'm actually like, I'm kind of like, I'm a professional, but I'm kind of intimidated by

54:56.380 --> 54:59.980
some of this. I'm like, Oh my God, I hope I don't ask the wrong questions or I hope I don't sound

54:59.980 --> 55:05.020
like an idiot or ask the questions that have been asked 5,000 times. Yeah. Cause that's how

55:05.020 --> 55:11.820
you end up in variety. I don't think I'm going to have that problem. That was a whole nother. That

55:11.820 --> 55:16.060
was a whole nother personality who, if they asked me to do that panel, I might've had a different

55:16.060 --> 55:21.500
answer, but you know, you live, you learn anyway. Um, all that. I wonder if he's going to be at

55:21.500 --> 55:27.340
dragon con that the one time I met Billy Mitchell was at dragon con. So I wonder if, uh, he'll be

55:27.340 --> 55:32.460
there. Bobby, do you know, do you know that? And Bobby also giving a nice Hardy fuck you Loki in

55:32.460 --> 55:37.900
our chat room over at live.vognetware.com. All right. And yes, bonds, double six says,

55:37.900 --> 55:41.500
that's what the room is for to ask the stupid questions. So you don't have to. And that's my

55:41.500 --> 55:44.780
plan to just let you know what they want to ask the questions. I'm not going to take over those

55:44.780 --> 55:48.860
panels. I'm gonna let them do it. Of course they might, they might ask that. I do feel like 20

55:48.860 --> 55:52.060
minutes or something and you know, I'll be ready for whatever. I'm already going through questions

55:52.140 --> 55:56.780
in my head. Uh, and if you're worried about somebody keeping my ego in check,

55:56.780 --> 56:02.220
remember Travis Donovan is returning to, uh, dragon con this year. And if anybody is going

56:02.220 --> 56:06.060
to sit there and go, listen, bitch, I made you and I can break you just as easily.

56:06.060 --> 56:16.060
It will be Travis Donovan. So there you go. All right. Anyway, uh, Bobby says, uh, he was just

56:16.060 --> 56:20.060
there as a guest of Southern fried game room expo last year, not as a guest. So I don't even think

56:20.060 --> 56:24.540
he had panels last year. He was just there. So we'll see. Hopefully he'll be back this year. I

56:24.540 --> 56:28.540
mean, you know, despite everything's been going on, actually, if he is there, I do kind of want

56:28.540 --> 56:32.780
to be there. If like Bobby and him cross paths, I want to see if like, you know, they, they,

56:33.500 --> 56:38.380
so how about that panel? You know, you want to be there too. All right. Anyway, we'll see.

56:39.660 --> 56:42.860
All right. Moving on. Let's get into some video game news. Uh, Loki.

56:43.660 --> 56:48.140
All right. So we can talk about things coming to the switch. So obviously with

56:48.140 --> 56:52.780
their whole online service, we're expecting more apps to be actually included with it.

56:52.780 --> 56:57.500
You know, aside from the obvious, you know, eventually Netflix and that stuff coming to

56:57.500 --> 57:03.260
the service, there is one app that is, um, supposed to be coming. And that is an app called,

57:03.260 --> 57:13.340
I believe inky pen. And so inky pen is a online, I guess, comics manga. And, um,

57:13.340 --> 57:18.300
I don't know if it's other magazines as well. Service, basically you can read

57:18.940 --> 57:23.500
those online. And so they have thousands of comics available at launch. It's supposed to

57:23.500 --> 57:28.940
be coming out sometime in November. So that's kind of neat. I like that, you know, this

57:29.580 --> 57:34.700
device will be used for some other media stuff. I wish that they would have, you know, a

57:36.300 --> 57:40.460
web browser and stuff as well, but I know that there, remember when the 3ds was going to have

57:40.460 --> 57:46.220
3d movies? It did very minimal, but no, that's right. They had like, didn't they have like

57:46.220 --> 57:50.220
cartoons and stuff? I remember seeing them in E3, but did the movies ever actually come out? Yeah,

57:50.220 --> 57:55.340
they did. Um, they were, they did digital version of like, there was a tech in CG movie that came

57:55.340 --> 58:01.420
up and they did that. That's right. I only ever saw the fucking dinosaur shorts and all that crap

58:01.420 --> 58:05.820
they had on the Nintendo. Yeah. I remember they were really pimping that. And then they just

58:05.820 --> 58:10.700
decided that, fuck it. No one wants 3d, which is wrong. We do want 3d, but we also want a

58:10.700 --> 58:16.380
powerful system that can run it. Um, so I hope they don't give up on 3d, but everybody else has,

58:16.380 --> 58:25.180
I guess. Hmm. But, um, yeah, it'll be, it'll be neat to see more apps on the service. I'm

58:25.180 --> 58:30.620
just curious to see if what else will be coming at some point. It just kind of gives us a timeframe.

58:30.620 --> 58:35.180
It also lends more fire to that whole discussion about, you know, the Nintendo switch is basically

58:35.180 --> 58:41.100
the successor to the PSP and the Vita. You've heard that one before. So they're gonna forget

58:41.100 --> 58:45.500
about it at some point. No, I don't. I think I saw it and be like, what? I don't think Nintendo

58:45.500 --> 58:49.980
will forget about it anytime soon. No, no, it's not going to suffer that same fate. We know that

58:49.980 --> 58:54.460
anyway. Um, but what is interesting is that, you know, what's old is new again on the Nintendo

58:54.460 --> 58:59.660
switch. It has been a bit of a port city, if you will. And, uh, that's not going anywhere anytime

58:59.660 --> 59:03.820
soon, especially with this announcement this week, the deep silver is bringing saints row,

59:03.820 --> 59:09.020
the third to the Nintendo switch. This was some news they made at games com saints row,

59:09.020 --> 59:15.420
the third originally launched on PS three PC and X-Box three 60. Keep in mind since this game has

59:15.420 --> 59:23.020
come out, we had saints row four and we had the ages of mayhem while not technically out of hell.

59:23.020 --> 59:27.900
That's right. So while technically agents of mayhem was fucking saints row, but it was terrible

59:27.900 --> 59:31.740
because they couldn't, they, they decided, Oh, Hey, we're going to make this really awesome hero

59:31.740 --> 59:37.260
shooter game. And then they're like, Oh crap, no one gives a shit about our awesome shooter game.

59:37.260 --> 59:41.020
Let's put saints broke characters in there and confuse the fuck out of everybody and piss off

59:41.020 --> 59:45.500
the saints or offense at the same time. Fine. What he said. Cause like I saw that the other

59:45.500 --> 59:50.140
day for 1499, I'm like, that's still too much to pay for that game. I'm not buying that.

59:50.140 --> 59:54.140
Here's the thing though. Saints wrote the third on switch will include all the DLC.

59:54.140 --> 59:58.220
So it will be kind of more of an all one. That is one thing that saints row, the third and the

59:58.220 --> 01:00:03.660
fourth did, um, quite well is they used to overcharge for DLC. So that is nice that that's

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:07.500
in there. That includes all like the Tron DLC and all that. Well, I mean, it's not Tron, but wink,

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:11.740
wink, right? It was that hacker group or whatever the crime. No, that was actually part of the game.

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:17.900
Oh, what's it? I thought that was, no, that was one of the, the boss guys that you fight against.

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:22.940
Okay. Who ends up becoming a good guy in the next game. But do you think there is an audience for

01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:26.780
this? I like, I, it's one of those things where I kind of laugh at it and I go, Oh my God,

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:30.780
what a, another port. But then I kind of go, well, it depends on the cost. If they're going

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:37.180
to try to charge $49.99 for this shit when it comes out, fuck them. I mean, cause I got this

01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:43.500
on like humble bundles for like, I think it was like a dollar. I mean, maybe like five bucks at

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:50.940
the moment. There is, there is an audience out there of gamers, Nintendo, $20 maybe. And that's,

01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:57.500
I think a bit much, uh, dark Tetsuya says it's $49.99. They can fuck right off. I'm serious.

01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:02.460
They can fuck right the hell off. Cause they would be different if it was like, you know,

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:06.220
here's the Loki. You and I both know it's going to be $49.99 for like the first month.

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:10.300
And that price is going to come down real fast. They can seriously fuck right off because I'm,

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:18.700
that is, he says IDK, actually IDK. Okay. All right. But if it's $49.99, that is way too

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:23.900
fucking much. $29.99 I think is going to be way too much for it. I mean, it's a fucking old ass

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:29.820
game and they're not like enhancing anything on it. Oh, we're throwing in the DLC. Big fucking

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:35.020
whoop. You can get that shit on PC. It was like a multiplayer you could do like in the same room.

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:44.780
Maybe Diablo is kind of going, they did in land parties. Me being a big fan of saves row. Yes. I

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:53.020
did play the multiplayer mode in there. It was fucking not good. It was, it's you basically it's

01:01:53.020 --> 01:02:00.540
it's you PVE is versus a bunch of like waves of enemies and it's dumb. As she 100 Matt points out,

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:05.020
I like the developers are running to put their game on the switch regardless if it's old.

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:08.860
I understand it, but like if here's what they could have done to make sweeten the pot. Okay.

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:13.980
Cause saints row, the third and the fourth and even get out of hell ran basically in the same

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:18.860
fucking engine is pretty much the same. Almost the same assets, at least the third and fourth.

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:24.060
Why not just put out, Hey, here's saints row. Third through got out of hell. The saints

01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:29.420
roll collection collection and then sell that for 49 99. That would be fucking worth it.

01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:35.820
This shit. Not worth it. All right, well let's move on Loki. I mean, not worth it. I'll let

01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:42.940
know the big clear, not worth it for 49 99 now, 19 99, maybe 14 99, probably a little bit better,

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:50.460
but eh, I'd be wary anything above that because you know, a lot of companies capcom like to charge

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:54.460
an exorbitant amount of money for these. Again, though, we all know it's going to come down in

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:58.140
price real fast. So, and it's even one of those things where like, and I know some of you might

01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:02.300
be thinking like, God, do you like ripping off the developers by way of it's like, dude,

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:07.020
this game is how old I didn't tell you the port this to the switch. That was your fucking idea.

01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:10.300
Clearly made their money back on this game or they wouldn't have made a fourth one. So I

01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:15.340
really think anything that they're making on this is like extra, a little bonus, little extra money,

01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:19.820
little extra something under the Christmas tree. So anyway, and the sad thing too is it's not even

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:24.780
coming out until next year. Okay. They're saying they have not announced a price yet is what chat

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:28.460
chat room has finally come to that consensus. They've not announced the price yet. All right.

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:33.180
Speaking of, is it worth it or not? Loki, we have an interesting change this week.

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:40.620
Okay. So, um, yeah, so Twitch decided that they're going to go ahead and change a bunch

01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:44.860
of stuff that you get with the whole Twitch prime membership. So the first thing they're changing

01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:49.340
is, Hey, you know, that all at all that ad free viewing that you had, well, that's gone.

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:56.540
So ad free viewing is going to cease after September 14th. Um, and basically they said,

01:03:56.540 --> 01:04:04.860
well, the reason why we're getting rid of the ads is to, um, I guess it, to pay their creators

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:11.660
more money is what they're doing. So they're paying their creators. They say more money

01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:18.140
because of this advertising is important or an important source of support for the creators

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:24.140
who make Twitch possible. You know, which creators it is. It ain't the creators like

01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:28.620
little old me, the affiliates, or even some of the like, you know, partners that are out there.

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:34.940
It ain't for them. It's because, at least this is my perception. It's because the e-sports stuff is

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:41.180
really growing and growing and growing on Twitch. Overwatch league is who this is for. Those, the

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:46.860
partners, this is for Overwatch league and the heroes stuff. And you know, the, the Dota

01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:50.620
tournament, even though that's a whole nother issue with the, the steam thing, uh, you know,

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:57.100
these types of big tournaments that are streamed over on, um, over on Twitch, I think those are

01:04:57.100 --> 01:05:02.140
the ones that are really chomping at the bit to probably put more ads within there. Because, I

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:07.820
mean, these things that you're watching with like Overwatch league and you know, the heroes league

01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:13.260
and what, all these other games that have the big league stuff streamed on Twitch, they're all like

01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:17.980
basically like full on TV production. I gotta think though, that these guys, like a lot of

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:22.140
streamers I see that watch it or kind of the big time stuff. I don't think they make a lot of money

01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:27.180
from ads anyways. I think most of that's coming from donations because I see a lot of like high

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:33.420
value donations coming in versus the ads. Well, a lot of the partners in response to this have

01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:37.340
been like, I'm not gonna, don't worry guys. I'm not going to put ads, but I mean, you kind of

01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:42.540
can't stop the ad that rolls before your stream. Well, I mean, unless you have Twitch prime

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:47.100
right now, uh, you don't see that ad. And if you subscribe to a channel, you don't see the ad. Like

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:52.460
I don't have a lot of subscribers to the Rob Roberts channel on YouTube. I don't have anybody

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:58.140
there. Uh, but over on Twitch, I don't have the subscribers there. Well, I have some, but to be

01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:02.460
fair, I don't stream a lot. I don't stream enough. If I was doing it three times a week, I'd probably

01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:07.340
be in better shape with that. But anyway, I mean, they don't see the ads when you subscribe directly.

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:13.580
That's also one way to get around it. Or you can get Twitch's thing that they had before Amazon

01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:19.900
bought them, which was the turbo thing, which turbo, which is eight bucks a month. And you get

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:27.340
ad free with that, which is lame. Um, and then of course, on top of that too, one of the things that,

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:33.180
um, I assume was part of this as well was the discount off of pre-ordering games. Well,

01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:39.100
you don't get it, you know, prime members don't get 20% off anymore. Um, off pre-order games.

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:43.660
Instead, you're going to get $10 back in promotional credit on select games.

01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:50.940
I mean, that sucks, but at the same time, I think a lot of stuff on Amazon seems to be cheaper

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:57.820
anyways. Well, okay. Number one, I think the one, two punch of this news was a really stupid thing

01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:03.820
to do the day after we have these huge rumors about steam TV. Yes. It wasn't smartest timing

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:09.900
ever. That was really bad timing on somebody's part. Also, I mean, also actually the steam TV

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:14.140
thing isn't even a rumor like they did. They finally did push that this week. I actually

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:17.260
just briefly, I was like, I wonder what this is all about. So I actually checked out the steam TV

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:23.420
thing and you can see that they have really worked on integrating steam into a, you know,

01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:28.380
Twitch TV type of interface where you can kind of go watch something with your friends. It's like

01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:32.300
a thing that you can do private chat rooms with your friends. They've worked in all the emote

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:37.580
icons from the trading trading decks and stuff are in that main chat and in all that, you know,

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:41.260
and then you can see on the side where the friends are playing, you know, the jury's still out

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:46.220
cause you know, we don't know what the community is going to look like on stream steam. We don't

01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:51.660
know what they're going to be incentivizing their creators to do. Right. We know on Twitch,

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:56.060
you've got the bits, you have ad revenues for partners. I suppose it will be interesting to

01:07:56.060 --> 01:08:02.220
see what steam does for that because steam also has this whole element where they are also

01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:06.220
a store. Now we see Twitch kind of trying to compete in that element. Maybe that's why

01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:10.060
steam wants to get in this business. I don't know. But now we see that steam, you know,

01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:15.980
you have a steam wallet that if you've ever like used it or you've ever sold like trading cards in

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:20.780
the marketplace, you have probably have some spare change in your steam wallet. Wouldn't that be

01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:26.380
interesting if you could like donate steam wallet money to your favorite streamer and put it in

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:31.180
their steam wallet so that streamer could turn around and either maybe cash it out at a certain

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:36.060
amount or buy games with it. I don't know. It just, it would seem like a very like that.

01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:43.020
It's already kind of there in that ecosystem. Sounds so ripe for exploitation with it does.

01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:48.140
And that, you know, again, I've had a lot of concerns with steam over the past year

01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:52.620
when it comes to a lot of the bullshit that's been happening on their store end. And the fact

01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:56.620
that at one point they, what they threw up their hand and said, we don't need to do curation

01:08:56.620 --> 01:09:00.220
anymore because there should be things on the storefront that piss you off. That was the dumbest

01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:03.740
response. Except that they're still not following through with that. There was an article I read

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:10.300
today. It was talking about like some of these erotic games or whatever, like risque like story

01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:15.660
visual novel games that they were still getting pushed back or even actually the one it was that

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:23.820
you must be 18 to enter game. Whereas like the mock, like browsing porno sites, you know, as like

01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:28.700
as a teenager on like, you know, dial up and stuff like that where you have to keep look,

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:31.420
watch out for your parents and stuff like that. And you're trying to view porn, but it's all

01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:37.020
ASCII art. And they're like, Oh, well we need you to censor this. It's like, it's ASCII art.

01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:40.540
That's going to be really fucking hard for me to do that. Here's the thing. I'm still pretty

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:46.460
dedicated to Twitch and I don't see myself leaving Twitch, but I will, I'll approach steam with an

01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:49.740
open mind. I'm always going to approach anything with an open mind. So if steam's going to launch

01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:53.340
this thing, I'll approach it with an open mind. But the number one thing steam is going to need

01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:57.660
to convince me is that they know what the fuck they're doing with this. And that's going to be

01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:01.820
more of a challenge than you might think. Right? Because my thought once again is that like,

01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:06.940
we don't have the resources to curate our storefront. So what makes you think you have

01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:12.220
the resources to curate your storefront and this video service? Let me go to our chat at

01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:16.700
live.vognetwork.com. Cause this is geo 100. Matt has a lot of great feedback on this, uh, as geo

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:21.180
100, Matt and chat says the company I work for handles a lot of event streaming that involves

01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:25.820
us running ads during stream sporting events. Things like what Twitch is doing are all being

01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:31.020
done by algorithms. No actual people. It seems like partners are in control of when their ads

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:35.980
play, but I think that is a bad idea because it can be abused. I hope in time it will be tweaked

01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:40.620
in some way to make their streamers and viewers happy. They already made the mistake by not

01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:45.500
including streamers in their discussions about this stuff. If you're transparent and forthcoming

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:50.300
with your community and actually listen to them, they will support you. Too many companies make

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:54.620
moves and beg for forgiveness later. Again, that all from SSG owner to Matt. Yeah. And the talk a

01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:59.020
little bit about what you kind of referenced it a little bit. Um, some of the streamers as,

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:03.820
you know, they don't like the fact that this service is going away, this ad free service. So

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:08.940
they're to kind of, um, combat it and protest against it. They're just shutting off their ads

01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:13.340
like fucking, no one's getting money then, you know, I don't need it. So it'll be interesting

01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:17.980
to see what develops like this news is not enough to make me go like, Oh, I got to get off of Twitch

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:25.020
or any of that. I'm not there really with this. You know, I, if it's one ad before my stream plays,

01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:27.980
I'm not going to scream and cry and hoop and holler. It's the end of the world.

01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:33.340
But if they start injecting ads in my stream, when I'm not able to control it,

01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:37.020
that's when I'm going to be really pissed off and start to go. I don't think mixer has ads right

01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:41.580
now. Yeah. It doesn't have ads. And that's the thing is Microsoft's dumping money into mixer.

01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:46.140
I actually was randomly looking at mixer because it was, it's on your Xbox dashboard, right? And

01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:49.900
I just had my Xbox on and there was nothing on Twitch. And I was like, I wonder what mixer's

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:54.460
up to these days. And I was on like the Microsoft one channel or whatever. I'm like, fuck, they got

01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:59.820
like this whole studio set up. They got these, this nice little set up. I'm like, okay, Microsoft

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:05.420
is dumping money into mixer because they really want this to happen. So it would be interesting.

01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:08.940
I know there's some people out there that prefer mixer, but you know, again, it's nice to have

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:17.980
options. I don't think mixer, mixer isn't wooing the little guys like me. Twitch did that. Mixers

01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:23.180
not doing that yet. Maybe they will, but right now Twitch kind of does that. Twitch has great

01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:27.420
discoverability and I think we'll continue to do so with the tagging, I think is a really good idea.

01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:31.420
You know, even though the communities are going away, I get that most of the communities

01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:36.540
were just the games, but at least the tagging will compensate for, I think the stuff that wasn't

01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:42.460
necessarily just communities. So, or game communities. So, yeah, I'm, I'm still, you know,

01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:46.940
okay. They're gonna change this whole ad thing, but I don't think it's the end of the world.

01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:52.140
I'm not gonna yell the sky is falling just yet because, you know, not everybody that watches

01:12:52.140 --> 01:13:00.460
my feed has Prime anyway, and it's still working okay. Right? So, yeah, we'll see what happens.

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:05.580
Let's see. Rama in chat says Microsoft has the mixer studio at their Fifth Avenue store.

01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:10.620
So that's expensive real estate. So they really, they really want to make mixer happen.

01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:17.500
But, you know, I found, you know, 10 years ago when you're up late at night and you've got

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:21.740
insomnia and it's like, I don't want to go to bed yet. You're flipping through the cable channels

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:26.300
and like, oh, there's a South Park rerun honors, whatever it is, you know, just flipping channels

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:31.100
late at night. Now it's, oh, let me go on Twitch. See who's broadcast. Let me go on mixer. What's

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:37.660
on? You know, like, wow, how times have changed, right? Because even on Twitch, the crazy thing is

01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:44.140
it's not all gaming on Twitch either. I was watching because Alan was sitting there with

01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:47.820
me and we were, you know, kind of watching TV together. And so I was on Twitch and I noticed

01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:53.260
one of the top streamers was doing like a live ASMR and Alan's kind of into all that ASMR stuff.

01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:57.500
I see him watching the videos and all that stuff. So I was like, look, Alan, they got one for you.

01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:02.060
So I was watching this girl that would just do the whole like, like the tapping of the microphones.

01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:10.700
I guess it's I'm old or something. I don't understand the ASMR stuff, but anyway.

01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:18.860
Let's see. Bobby Black Wolf says, now when I have insomnia, I go watch Flaco playing Splatoon at

01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:23.900
2 AM. I don't even enjoy Splatoon, but I enjoy asking Flaco about Moret Towers.

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:29.740
And that Dark Tetsuya says, Oh God, is Rob on the ASMR thing again?

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:34.300
Yes. Maybe, you know what? One of these days, maybe we'll do like a charity fundraiser or

01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:41.020
something. And if we raise like a hundred dollars, I'll do a special ASMR. Would that be fun? Loki,

01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:47.020
would you watch that? That is not going to be fun. I'll eat it. I'll eat a pickle on a microphone.

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:56.300
Yeah. Thank you. Dark Tetsuya says ASMRob. I love it. Patent pending. All right. Let's move on.

01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:01.020
Let's talk about Assassin's Creed. Something you will not be looking forward to next year.

01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:07.100
There is not going to be an Assassin's Creed in 2019. They're taken a year off. And I think many

01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:13.100
of us are probably looking at this going, not a bad idea. That's okay. You go ahead and take a

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:18.540
year off. Although I will say this new Assassin's Creed, the Odyssey looks more interesting than an

01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:23.180
Assassin's Creed game has to be. Guess we know when Watch Dogs 3 will be coming out or whatever

01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:32.380
Tom Clancy game. Anyway, in an interview with GameSpot CEO of Ubisoft, Yves Guillemot. I never

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:37.980
say that guy's name, right? Anyway, on Assassin's, we had a game in 2017. We have one this year.

01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:42.700
We're not going to have a full fledged Assassin's next year. Notice he says full fledged Assassin's,

01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:46.780
but that we do know there's been download games. So they may, they may do a tiny title or something.

01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:51.020
Anyway, it's just because the team were working separately. So we have two games now, one year

01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:55.260
after the other, but next year, you're not going to have a fully fledged one. So confirmation not

01:15:55.260 --> 01:16:00.540
to look forward to that in 2019. But of course, you're right. Ubisoft's got plenty of franchises.

01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:04.940
They'll have something else to fill in the gap. I'm sure. Let's get to Loki and then we'll get to

01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:14.540
our classic game of the week. So Gabe Newell, he recorded some announcer voices for Dota 2.

01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:21.900
And of course, you know, they had a mega kill pack, I guess, which had him recording different

01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:27.820
lines for the game. And it was kind of funny as, of course, they mentioned, you know, some of the

01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:33.100
lines in there. One of the lines of kind of playing into the joke that, you know, he can't

01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:39.820
count the three. And so, of course, it says you have more than two kills, but less than four

01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:46.060
because he won't say three. And it's kind of funny. Okay, I get it. That's funny.

01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:53.100
Yes, it's irritating, but it's funny. And then I guess they have that coming out

01:16:54.540 --> 01:17:01.100
right now during the international. So that'll be part of a update, I think, coming soon.

01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:08.140
All right. Well, we're going to go on a way trip back. You know, I know the Dota 2.

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:12.460
I'm sorry. Yeah. And you can get that by actually purchasing the internationals battle pass.

01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:18.860
Oh, so it's like included with the whole like watching the tournament along. Okay. All right.

01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:24.220
Well, you know what? There was no battle pass back in the day. You know what? There's no streaming.

01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:30.060
There's no tournaments would be at the mall. You go to the mall and compete in the latest

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:36.780
tournaments. It's the classic game of the week. And it's still my voice and not talking about

01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:44.060
radio magic. Unfortunately, radio magic got broken. And unfortunately, dark soccer, not

01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:48.060
able to join us for the classic game of the week this week. But you know what? Once in a while,

01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:52.060
we get to play low gear. Myself get to pick a classic game instead. So that's what we're

01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:56.540
going to do this week where I will pick the classic game of the week. So I thought I'm

01:17:56.620 --> 01:18:02.380
going to go way back in the archives. And I thought I would go back to the Atari 2600

01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:05.820
for this week's classic game of the week. And something a little bit timely because

01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:10.620
we talked about a unreleased sequel to this game some time ago. That's right. Tonight,

01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:15.580
we're going to talk about Keystone Capers is the classic game of the week. And there's the

01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:21.660
brilliant Atari 2600 sounds playing in the background of this game. So Keystone Capers

01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:26.780
was made by Activision. So it had that very unique looking cartridge with like those little

01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:31.020
rainbow trails behind the policeman that was like the main character in this game with all that

01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:36.380
crazy art. So anyway, Keystone Capers was made by active or published by Activision. And it came out

01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:42.460
for the Atari 2600 in April of 1983. It was also ported to other systems. So it came out on the

01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:48.620
ColecoVision. It came out on Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit systems, and believe it or not, the MSX.

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:53.100
I didn't even realize MSX ever got a version of this. That's really cool. So anyhow, the

01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:58.540
inspiration from the series is supposed to come from like those old, like really old, like silent

01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:04.220
movies where you had like the policeman that looked more like the Bobby cops. I don't remember

01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:07.820
what they're called, but like the London types with like the big, you know, baton and the big

01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:13.180
hats. It's kind of inspired by that style where they're trying to catch the robber. So anyhow,

01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:18.060
you play as a main character named officer Keystone Kelly, and you try to catch Harry

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:23.820
Hooligan. Now what's funny is I mentioned a mall in the whole setup to this here. That's actually

01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:29.500
the setting for Keystone Capers is it's this giant department store. So Keystone Capers,

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:34.700
part of what made it unique is that you had multiple screens. So you would run, it was like

01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:39.420
you saw this world map on the bottom. So you would see this, you know, map that showed the department

01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:43.100
store in the four floors. And you could see a little icon representing yourself and Nikon

01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:47.180
representing the robber. And as you move from screen to screen, you kind of got a sense that

01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:52.780
like, Oh, this mall is department stores like 10 screens long. You know what I mean? So the robber

01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:58.140
would slowly move or excuse me, Harry Hooligan or whatever his name is, would slowly move through

01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:03.100
the ball and you got to catch him, but you start on the bottom and he starts kind of like in the

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:08.380
middle. So maybe if you time it right, you can take an elevator to catch him, or maybe you're

01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:12.300
going to have to just try to take the escalators and outrun him. But throughout the department

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:16.860
store, there are things that try to chase you like killer shopping carts that try to run you over

01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:23.180
giant balls that bounce. And if one hits you in the head, I guess you're allergic to plastic balls

01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:27.420
or something because it stops you and you have to start all the way from the beginning. And then I

01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:31.900
don't know what these are like radios or something that you're supposed to jump over. Toy planes,

01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:37.100
basically all this random shit that somebody was like, Hey, we could make an Atari sprite that

01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:41.660
would kind of look like that. And it would fit the shopping mall theme. Any enemies?

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:44.220
Uh, fuck. I don't know. How about a big ball?

01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:51.420
Anyway, the designer that made this game was Gary kitchen. Gary kitchen was the older cause

01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:55.820
remember back in the day on target 2,600 only took like one person to make a game, basically.

01:20:55.820 --> 01:21:01.020
Uh, some of the other games that, uh, this guy made, uh, donkey Kong, the arcade port on the

01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:06.540
Atari 2,600 pressure cooker was the other big game. And then he did some stuff on the Commodore 64,

01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:11.180
including a game that I know I have done a previously as the classic game of the week,

01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:15.660
Ghostbusters on the Commodore 64. He did some additional programming on that game. So it wasn't

01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:21.820
just himself. Um, but you know, what's also really cool. The, uh, individual again, Gary kitchen

01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:26.460
behind Keystone capers also contributed to some of your NES favorites. You ready for this?

01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:33.740
He co-designed and programmed with David Crane, a boy in his blob trouble in blobonia. Uh,

01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:39.100
he also did Bart versus the space mutants where he was the lead design and programmer,

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:43.580
and then Bart versus the world where he did design and programming. So there you go. So kind of,

01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:47.900
it's kind of some other stuff that he worked on, which is pretty cool. So anyway, I already kind

01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:51.820
of talked about how the game sort of plays. Uh, and you know, it's one of those things where

01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:57.260
it gets harder and harder. There's more stuff, more killer balls, more toy planes that they throw

01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:02.300
at you and so forth. As you progress from each board, there is no end to the game. It just gets

01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:07.580
harder and harder and harder, but, uh, the game was well received. I know it, uh, sold very well.

01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:12.780
It's included in a lot of Activision, uh, collections. Uh, it actually won a certificate

01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:19.020
of a merit or acknowledgement, uh, as the 1980, excuse me, 1984 video game of the year,

01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:26.380
less than 16 K ROM. This game is less than 16 kilobytes crazy. Anyway, that was at the

01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:33.420
Arkie awards. Uh, Antic called this game the perfect game for anyone and commended the superb

01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:40.540
animation in the game. And it got three stars. The ColecoVision version did in the Deseret News

01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:46.220
for all you, uh, Latter-day Saints folks that are following what's going on in the news.

01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:52.700
Anyway, uh, there you go. That is, uh, Keystone Capers. Now there was a sequel, of course,

01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:57.340
that we got into a little bit last week. The sequel never came out, but we know that it would

01:22:57.340 --> 01:23:02.140
have taken place on a train and the graphics were pretty good because now it incorporated this whole,

01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:06.460
like very primitive version of parallax scrolling, where you were really like going through the

01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:13.180
desert on this train and it looked really good graphic wise. So there you go. Uh, Tigerclaw

01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:17.340
points out, you can play this game free online right here and links to one of those eighties

01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:22.220
arcade websites that you can do that. And, uh, yeah, uh, dark Tetsuya says better hurry

01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:26.620
before Nintendo pulls the plug on that too. Well, to be fair, this is between Atari and

01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:33.020
Activision still try to pull the plug. No fun for anyone as the internet goes where it disappears.

01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:38.620
One place it'll pop up again. I know this game is in that latest flashback eight console where

01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:45.020
it teams up with Activision and Activision compiles their games and does like release.

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:50.140
I know I played Keystone capers on like PlayStation or, or one of those lately,

01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:54.700
like there was a recent compilation that had it in it because Activision always piles, you know,

01:23:54.700 --> 01:24:00.060
they, they, they do these compilations resell our game, but to be fair, they had a lot of great

01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:05.740
shit on the Atari 2600. These are classics. They did games like pitfall and pitfall too,

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:11.500
or also Activision, uh, the boxing game that was really famous on Atari was, uh, by them

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:15.740
freeway. Um, just all these games that were really, really good on Atari,

01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:19.980
2,600 were all Activision. So anyway, there's one for your classic game of the week,

01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:26.700
Keystone capers on the Atari 2,600, my pick because dark Sakura unable to attend tonight,

01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:32.220
the radio magic, the interference was just too strong. Dark Tetsuya brings up another

01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:36.700
Activision classic in our chat over at live.vognetware.com. I dig river raid.

01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:40.140
I think that was one of my favorites. That was a great, uh, river raid. If I remember right,

01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:45.340
was, uh, one of the first big, big, big games like that to have a female programmer and designer

01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:49.980
behind that. It was that or the sequel. I think it was, I think it was the original river raid

01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:54.940
though. Of course, now that I'm on the spot, I can't remember. Did you ever play any, uh,

01:24:54.940 --> 01:25:00.860
Atari 2,600 games, namely the Activision stuff? Um, yeah, pitfall mainly. I mean,

01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:06.540
I didn't really have a 2,600. I had a clico, but I have the 2,600 adapter. We didn't really have

01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:13.260
a lot of things in ET. And Carol Shaw did do the original river raid. I just, I had to look that

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:17.740
up. I needed to know. So combat used to play a lot of combat. That wasn't Activision though.

01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:23.820
That was Atari. I know, but still, I know they're great. We haven't had a whole lot of Atari 2,600

01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:28.540
stuff. It's the classic game of the week. I know, uh, dark Sakura was more of a clico, more of a,

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:32.140
you know, she kind of had the other systems. So once in a while we got to throw out an Atari 2,600.

01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:39.100
There's also, um, I'm not sure if it's 10 years yet, but halo 2,600, which is an official game

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:45.020
that is made by one of the creators of halos. You'll have to talk to her about that. All right.

01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:49.180
Anyway, we're going to take a break guys. When we come back, we will have more of orange launch

01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:53.740
radio, including rapid fire news. Uh, we'll talk a little bit about Fortnite. Guess what? We get

01:25:53.740 --> 01:26:00.060
to bring up more switch online stuff and, uh, Oh boy, you know, I love my scary games, right? Loki

01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:05.580
and, uh, the makers of until Dawn have announced their newest project. It actually, I got to say,

01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:09.900
it looks really cool. That doesn't mean I'll play it, but it looks really cool. So

01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:14.300
I'm played until Dawn. Oh my God. You gotta get on that. I have it. I just haven't played it.

01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:18.220
Cause we got a free as part of the PlayStation plus thing, but all right, we got to get on that.

01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:22.540
All right. Anyway, uh, let's, uh, let's take a break. We'll come back with more of orange

01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:34.060
lounge radio right after this. Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight

01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:42.380
on August the 26th of 2018 with episode number 743 of our show already in progress. Myself and

01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:47.580
Loki here in studio dark soccer, of course, is still off on leave for a little while, uh,

01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:52.300
due to a work conflict, but we hope to hear from her again real soon. Uh, again, we'll not be here

01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:58.380
live. Thanks to a dragon con, but I hope to see many of you guys out there at dragon con.

01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:05.580
Let's get back into some rapid fire news. Shall we Loki? We shall. All right. Okay.

01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:11.740
So he seemed like you were so prepared for that. No, I got nothing else to talk about. I was just

01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:18.620
posting a weird wizard smash ultimate reference into the, uh, God. All right. Anyways. Um, so

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:22.540
let's talk a little bit about Shenmue three, Shenmue one and two came out and apparently

01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:26.700
it's Shenmue one and two, and they didn't really do a whole ton of shit with them and

01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:31.100
make it somehow buggier and larger in file size. But

01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:35.900
Shenmue threes, uh, right around the corner, actually about one year away.

01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:43.660
It's scheduled now for August 19th is the release date. And, uh, I'm sorry, August, 2009, um,

01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:49.740
August 27th, 2009, to be exact, um, PlayStation four and PC 2019. Right. Yeah.

01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:58.380
Keeps saying 2009. Well, the game seems like it should be out in 2009, but, um, no. So August 27th,

01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:07.100
2019. So almost actually one year away from tomorrow. So not bad to announce that. Um,

01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:11.420
so I guess we'll have to wait and see if that's any better than the other two games because

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:18.700
I didn't really play them, but their views haven't been super great. I don't know. Um,

01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:25.820
and then speaking of games in 2019, blood stained has been delayed to 2019 as well.

01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:30.700
And this will come as no surprise, I'm sure. But the PlayStation Vita version,

01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:38.380
it's been canceled. So I keep some, well, I can't say I'm incredibly surprised at that.

01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:44.700
Yeah. So, uh, bloodsane though is going to be coming out next year. Of course, you know,

01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:49.180
the Wii U version prior to this was also canceled, but they're doing a switch version. So,

01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:55.260
Hey, maybe there's a chance for another port of the game. If PlayStation comes out with a new

01:28:55.260 --> 01:29:02.380
handheld system, but until then, probably not. Can you believe that the game was crowdfunded in 2015?

01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:07.820
It's been that long. Yeah, I know. Cause I'm one of the people,

01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:11.740
one of those suckers that paid money for it back then, but yeah, I'm going to just hold out hope

01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:17.740
that the game's real good. I hope so. I enjoyed the little eight bit game that they made. They

01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:22.940
didn't really make that though. That was more of, um, was it the other team that did like

01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:29.900
blaster master? And so I still liked it, whatever. All right. You didn't give, have them make more

01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:33.420
games. They guardian legend, you know, you already know how I feel about that. That's how

01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:38.860
it has come up on the show before. Anyway, let's talk about soul caliber six. I'm still excited

01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:43.340
for soul caliber six, which is coming out soon. Uh, there is a brand new character finally there,

01:29:43.340 --> 01:29:47.580
like most of the roster for soul caliber six is all like old characters, which is fine.

01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:50.540
There's a lot of old characters that should come back, but there is finally another new character

01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:56.620
announced for soul caliber six. It is a magician named as well, uh, a self-proclaimed leader of

01:29:56.620 --> 01:30:01.580
humanity. So anyway, uh, as well as only the second original character in soul caliber six

01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:07.100
after grow, which I don't know if I'm saying that right. Anyway, uh, his weapon is the palindrome.

01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:12.540
It apparently summons other weapons out of thin air, even during his combos. Interesting. All

01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:17.420
right. Final fantasy 15. Yeah. So anyhow, uh, what's interesting though about soul caliber six,

01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:20.780
you know, we haven't talked about it in a while, but, uh, they're announcing some of the characters

01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:25.740
as DLC already, including Tyra. Who's like the, the, she was the hoop girl from three.

01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:29.500
I really liked playing as her and some people already kind of pissed off that like, yeah,

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:33.340
soul caliber is already like, well, the game's not going to be complete when you get it. Cause

01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:39.580
we have all this DLC coming. So sell that season pass. So a $60 game is really going to cost a

01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:45.980
little more like, eh, probably 80, a hundred. This is why we wait for the game of the year

01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:54.700
edition for games like this. Anyway, uh, Bob coffee and chat says I prefer as well by his

01:30:54.700 --> 01:31:02.700
true name, Nicholas mage is custom creator back. And I don't know if the custom character

01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:07.100
things back in six, but maybe you can make your own anyway. Uh, moving on, let's talk about the

01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:10.860
last remnant. That's right. You remember that game? That game is probably pushing 10 years old

01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:16.300
itself. I think I have it in my library. It was an Xbox 360 game. I got it on steam sale one time.

01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:23.180
I think there's like a squarey mix. I think it was Squeenix is first unreal engine game. Yes.

01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:27.820
It was an unreal free game. I believe. I think that was what made this kind of a big deal,

01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:33.420
but anyway, holy shit. It's like final fantasy, but unreal, man. It's going to be awesome.

01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:40.060
The Xbox 360 version was kind of buggy. The steam version was apparently better. Um,

01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:43.820
if you've never played the steam version, you don't have much time left to try it out.

01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:49.340
You will not be able to buy this game anymore after September 4th, 2018, uh, in America and

01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:53.340
Europe and September 5th in Japan. If you get a copy of the game before the cutoff,

01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:57.820
you of course can still access it. You can still play it, but steam is removing the game on

01:31:57.820 --> 01:32:03.740
September 4th at 10 AM Pacific time. Um, no warning has been put on the Xbox marketplace

01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:07.740
about this. We'll see. Maybe on Monday, if Microsoft releases anything, uh, the steam

01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:11.980
announcement also specifically is calling out the PC version of the game is getting delisted,

01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:17.420
but again, no. Yeah. And the game is 10 years old. It was on the 360 in 2008. I thought I had it,

01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:25.020
but I guess I don't see it. And went over to PC in 2009. No word on why, why would you, I mean,

01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:29.660
cause I don't think it's music rights or anything like that. I don't know if maybe it's to do with

01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:36.060
the ports and maybe the company that handled that or what. Maybe they're remastering. I don't know.

01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:39.820
This is a game they're going to remaster. I don't know. Probably not, but, um, yeah, it's weird.

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:44.620
I thought I had the last room and it, maybe it's sitting in my humble bundles stuff somewhere.

01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:48.860
Ah, who cares? It's 10 years old. Fuck it. I'm not going to play. If I had it,

01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:53.180
it would just be sitting in my library gathering does anyway, dark to see you in chat says,

01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:57.820
and that's why Frank is doing what he's doing. And that's the guy that I know does a lot with

01:32:57.820 --> 01:33:01.420
the video game preservation, I think has that museum and everything. And, you know,

01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:06.380
brings up a good point is that, and this is kind of goes back to all the ROM stuff we were talking

01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:11.340
about some time ago is that, you know, sometimes when we're downloading games, it's not about like

01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:17.500
quote unquote stealing games. It's about having a way to play games when rights and contracts

01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:21.900
and digital stuff and all these other things lead to games literally disappearing. Now,

01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:25.740
the good news about the last remnants specifically is that, you know, you'll always have the X-Box

01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:31.980
three 60 disc. So it's not like that part's like $10, but yeah, but the steam version apparently

01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:35.980
fixed bugs on the three 60 version, the steam version, I believe is the better version of the

01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:39.340
game. At least from what I've heard, we will have played it. It's the better version of the game to

01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:43.500
play. I swear I had that game. Yeah. I got to look at my humble bundle library now. All right.

01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:47.180
Anyway, let's travel around and check out what's coming out in stores this week that will be

01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:54.700
removed from shelves in 2028. Well, uh, I can tell you one game that's going to be coming out that,

01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:59.740
well, there's already been removed from shelves at one time and that would be the blob too.

01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:05.340
They're doing the remaster though for that. And so that's going to be coming out this week on the

01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:13.020
Nintendo switch, um, blade strangers, which is on PC switch and PlayStation four. That was that

01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:19.100
fighting game. That was by the guys that did guilty gear. Um, the game I've been looking

01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:23.500
forward to, if you're a fan of Katamari, you'll definitely dig this donut country. It's coming

01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:29.740
out on PC, Mac, PlayStation four and hype in this game a little bit. Yeah. It's going to be awesome.

01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:35.340
So I'm definitely looking forward to checking that out. Um, a game called Fern's gate on the

01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:43.580
switch and PlayStation four, a new PlayStation VR game firewall zero hour. Um, we also have

01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:51.660
monster hunter generations ultimate on Nintendo switch pro Evo soccer 2019 on PC PlayStation four

01:34:51.660 --> 01:35:00.860
and Xbox one strange brigade on PC PlayStation four and Xbox one, Victor Vran overkill edition

01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:11.180
on Nintendo switch. Um, Yakuza, Kiwami two on PlayStation four. And then we have penguin wars

01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:19.980
on PlayStation four, the messenger on PC and the switch and two, let's see, two point hospital on

01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:27.420
PC, Mac and Linux, which I believe that was a followup to one point hospital. No, I think

01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:32.140
that's a fun, if I remember correctly, that's a followup to like, maybe it was it life and death

01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:37.260
or something like that. Um, Oh, I don't remember. I, there was something that I thought it was like

01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:42.780
a followup to is that the hyper realistic surgical game from like the nineties that was on CD rom.

01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:47.260
Maybe that was talking about, um, wasn't there a game called life and death that was, am I crazy?

01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:51.900
Maybe it's sim hospital or something like that. I don't know. It's a hospital game, obviously,

01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:56.860
but, um, I thought it was a followup to something. I remember hearing about it,

01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:05.660
but I know life and death was like, um, it was a 1998 or excuse me, 1988 game for the software

01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:11.820
tool works. It was a realistic medical computer game. That was the game life. So, okay. This game,

01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:16.540
not that it's basically, yeah, it's a follow up to theme hospital. That's what it was. I'm sorry.

01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:23.340
So basically, dang, life and death. That was kind of a fucking title form. Was it, uh,

01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:30.780
appendectomies and we did it wrong. Play tic tac toe on the appendix. And that does that.

01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:39.900
This kills the patient. Wow. It was only later on that I'd find out that surgeon simulator is my

01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:44.460
game to go to for that type of thing. Um, anyways, so yeah, this is going to be basically a game

01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:48.620
where you, uh, own a private, you privately owned hospital with the goal of curing patients

01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:56.300
of fictitious comical ailments. So see as yeah, theme hospital followup. And then finally,

01:36:56.300 --> 01:37:00.300
which MXC gets a cookie in our chat room for getting that right. He, he called out theme

01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:05.740
hospital long before you got to it. And then finally we have a Naruto to, um,

01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:12.940
burrito, shinobi striker. So Naruto to burrito and it's a fighting game.

01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:18.940
Naruto burrito. It's a strange name. That's my drag name. Please welcome to the stage.

01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:29.100
Naruto burrito. Anyway, uh, let's move on and talk about Japan. Guess what? Naruto to burrito.

01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:35.660
Shinobi striker is also out in Japan this week. So, uh, Naruto knows no brown, no bounds. Uh,

01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:41.500
also a game called world and syndrome on the PS four little dragons cafe is also out on the

01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:46.540
PlayStation four. And, uh, this is a game getting like regular limited edition sound box, like all

01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:52.860
these different types of additions. It's a game called side Vario delta. It's a shmup. Basically.

01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:56.860
It's one of those like vertical scrolling, shoot them up type games, which sadly a lot of those

01:37:56.860 --> 01:38:01.020
don't really make their way over here, but, uh, that is, that is apparently a big release on

01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:05.500
PlayStation four this week. Uh, also though on a PlayStation four this week, that will be a big

01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:11.660
deal winning 11, 2019, which of course is the soccer, a big series over there, uh, by Konami,

01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:17.980
uh, pro Evo soccer, same thing as winning 11 in Japan. Uh, blade strangers is another release,

01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:24.620
uh, over in Japan from Piki comes out, uh, this coming week on August the 30th, uh, quickly looking

01:38:24.620 --> 01:38:28.940
at the switch to see if we have any big releases this week. That side very, our Delta is also on

01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:35.820
the switch this week, uh, as is the blade strangers and a tennis world tour. If you're a tennis person,

01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:41.580
let's let, let's head over to Europe. Loki. Yes. So this week we have monster hunter generations

01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:24.540
us to know. Baruto is Naruto son for those not in the know. The more you didn't realize

01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:30.060
he was old enough to have a son. I mean, he looks so young. Uh, Naruto had sex.

01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:34.540
Redo be fucking.

01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:42.700
They grow up so fast and they have their own children. Oh my God.

01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:50.300
Um, and then also we've got divinity original sin to definitive edition on PlayStation four

01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:59.180
and Xbox one, a game called punchline on, um, the PS four, uh, shadows awakening on PlayStation

01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:07.820
four, Xbox one and PC. And that'd be it. Ramo would like to clarify. There was a time jump

01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:13.420
and burrito takes place about 20 years later where he be fucking.

01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:21.900
Let's get to the mailbag. I have, I have no good transition. Let's go fuck the emails.

01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:29.500
Fuck those emails. Participate at orange lounge. Radio.com is the place where you can send us an

01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:37.420
email and we read our favorites here, uh, live on air at, uh, the show. So of course, uh,

01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:42.540
we're going to be off for a week. I mean, if you're naming your child,

01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:50.140
what name should I give him? How about burrito? That is an original name. That's stupid.

01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:55.820
Name him something different. That one, that would have been like, your name is Matt. People

01:40:55.820 --> 01:41:03.260
may not know, but your actual name is Matt. And if you'd name your kid, Pat, Matt and Pat, would

01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:09.340
you, would your wife have let you do that? No, it would have been stupid, but it's even stupider if

01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:18.940
like, it'd be like saying like, hello, this is Jeremy and meet his son bear me. I mean,

01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:21.740
I'm pretty sure I follow somebody on Twitter named bear me,

01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:28.780
but it means something very different than usually it doesn't mean you're the son. It

01:41:28.780 --> 01:41:37.980
means you're the dad. Just so you know. Anyway, uh, I like Bobby Michael. That's just a theory,

01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:45.020
a naming theory. I caught that reference as well. Can I get to the goddamn email? Yes.

01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:51.580
Fuck those emails. All right. Our email tonight is unsigned. Uh, and it comes from it's,

01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:56.060
it's unsigned. And I don't even know if I want to read it. We'll say K T Y because that's kind

01:41:56.060 --> 01:42:03.500
of in the, the title of the Katie. I sure we'll say it's from Katie. All right. So it'd be Karuto.

01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:12.540
You never know. All right. Karuto fine. Karuto. Karuto sends us an email that says this is,

01:42:12.540 --> 01:42:19.820
this is email the century right here. You ready? Dear Loki, I love you. At least somebody does.

01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:27.100
Also dark Sakura. I love you. Well, she's, she's not here to hear that unfortunately,

01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:30.300
but you can always send her tweet or something. She'll project. We'll sit,

01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:34.780
we'll pass along that I love. Uh, and finally, Rob, you're all right.

01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:43.820
J K I love you too. Oh, thank you. That is all. Have a nice day. Oh, thank you. And that's the

01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:51.820
email we got this week. All right. Well, that's, that's awesome. No questions. No, just, just,

01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:56.220
just a little. I'm not, I'm actually not making fun of that. I, I, I appreciate that somebody

01:42:56.220 --> 01:43:00.380
took the time out of their day to write that I do as active puts in the chat room, Rob,

01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:07.020
Buto and Lakuto and the special guests that runs in and out of here. Mr. Smoosh, Ruto, Smoosh.

01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:13.660
You too. Yes. Yeah. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says it's always good just to tell content

01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:18.460
creators. You appreciate them. You know what? That is, that is true. That stuff holds some weight.

01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:24.220
You know, it's no secret that the beginning of this show tonight was, was challenging.

01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:29.420
But when you get an email like that, it's kind of goes, okay, this is, this is why I pushed through.

01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:34.300
This is why we talk about, you know, the heavy stuff as well as the Naruto burritos of the world.

01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:38.700
Like what a show this has been tonight. You, you can probably take two clips from this show

01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:44.940
and people would not think it's the same show, but that's the way it works sometimes. Sometimes

01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:48.780
this show can put you in a better mood than you were before. And I think that's probably one of

01:43:48.780 --> 01:43:53.420
the best things about doing it. And I hope that comes through in listening to it as well. Anyway,

01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:57.980
so I agree with Mr. Blackwolf in our chat, that it is always just great to tell content creators

01:43:57.980 --> 01:44:04.220
that you appreciate them. And let me tell you listeners, I appreciate you. And that email,

01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:08.620
even if it was unsigned and I can't really credit you beyond your given name, Karuto,

01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:12.780
I appreciate you for sending that as well. And I love you too.

01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:19.500
All right. Let's get into some more emails. And if you want to send us an email, I'm sorry,

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:23.100
we're going to get into more news, but if you want to send us an email for a future week,

01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:28.700
when we get back from our week off for Labor Day, participate at orangelauntrady.com is the

01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:32.860
place to send those emails. So let's get back into some gaming news and then we'll get you

01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:37.340
your calls. Loki. All right. Let's talk about another game they don't play, Fortnite. But hey,

01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:43.180
it is the popular game of the week, month, year. So you'll be happy to know if you play

01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:48.940
Fortnite competitively, that there is some updates coming for you. Epic has made a statement saying

01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:53.820
that we are aware of the strong desire from competitive players for more opportunities to

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:59.580
compete directly against one another within the same match. Development recently began

01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:06.300
for a robust competition system, which will allow for all players to compete with one another and

01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:12.540
be recognized for other accomplishments. So we have a lot to learn from experiments

01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:19.580
with scoring schemes and formats, attempting to find the best balance between simplicity,

01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:25.900
entertainment, server performance and competitive integrity. Expect for us to continue operating

01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:31.580
and supporting competitive events after the conclusion of the summer skirmish as we lead

01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:42.140
into next year's official Fortnite World Cup. Neat. Cool story, bro. Cool story PR guy.

01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:51.100
No, look, I tried to play Fortnite. Maybe I'll try Fortnite again sometime. I don't know. I just

01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:55.740
need to play with the right people. I think the problem was I played Fortnite by myself and I was

01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:59.500
like, I literally have no fucking idea what I'm doing. Like, I might as well have been wearing

01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:03.340
a bucket on my head, running around in circles going, I'm going to kill you with my wooden spoon.

01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:07.980
Like that, that was my Fortnite experience because there's like no tutorial or anything to help you

01:46:07.980 --> 01:46:13.820
in Fortnite. You just, you got to get good, bitch. Get good. Yeah. And, uh, I have a hard time getting

01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:19.100
good. I'm 40. You need, I, I, you need to explain things to me. I don't have time for getting good.

01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:26.060
Exactly. I don't know how much time I have left. I don't have time to get good. It's not like my old

01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:32.460
job where I could play during lunch and then I got really good, but it's, it's my current job,

01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:36.700
which our internet sucks. I can't play during lunch, unfortunately. Um, act Efton chat says

01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:41.260
Fortnite with friends is so much fun. Alone is really difficult. Yeah. I kind of, I don't doubt

01:46:41.260 --> 01:46:45.580
that that's the case to be honest. Um, and of course with Fortnite, there's this whole meta

01:46:45.580 --> 01:46:51.340
thing that goes on. Um, they've got this rift that's been appearing in the game and now

01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:58.620
apparently the rift has begun shooting lightning out and then finally the rift closed and a giant

01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:05.420
cube has appeared and no one knows what the fuck the cube is, but I'm sure as Peter Molyneux will

01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:11.260
be, uh, making a game to help us figure out what's in the cube. Remember I, did you like

01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:18.700
that? Throwback in the center of the cube will be a Patreon. The center of the queue was a kickstart.

01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:21.500
What the fuck was it in the center of the queue? It was like a Kickstarter or something. No,

01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:27.500
the center of the cube was supposed to be, you got money for his stupid or from his stupid game that

01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:31.980
he had out. I don't remember what it was. You were like the owner of the game. I got to make

01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:36.380
decisions and you got revenue from the game. Oh right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was just like,

01:47:36.380 --> 01:47:41.820
which did anybody hear about that game? That was stupid. Yeah. Okay. And no one gives shit. Um,

01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:47.900
so no, what's in the center of the cube though, surprisingly enough, it's another remaster of

01:47:47.900 --> 01:47:54.460
Skyrim in the center of that cube. I swear to God, no, we have to, we have to talk about

01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:59.020
Peter Molyneux's fucking cube again because I swear to God, it was a Kickstarter that was like,

01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:02.380
I know the guy got, but it was like a kid. The whole thing was a fucking Kickstarter.

01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:08.700
No, they had a Kickstarter. Okay. No, he had a Kickstarter for his other game. So he did that.

01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:15.580
But then he also had this stupid cube thing, which everybody's like, what's in the cube?

01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:21.340
And then it just arbitrarily ended after people, I guess, mined away at it because it was like,

01:48:21.340 --> 01:48:26.140
you know, you could buy stuff, the mine faster. So yeah, it sort of, I guess it was a Kickstarter

01:48:26.140 --> 01:48:30.300
thing where they're earning tons of money towards it, but then it was just the crappy

01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:34.620
goddess or whatever it was. Okay. So I finally found, so goddess, thank you.

01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:41.980
Chat goddess came out, which G G O D U S, but I'm saying goddess, even though I'm not referring to

01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:47.820
the show that they present in the show girls movie, cause no me Malone does star in goddess,

01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:50.860
which would be an infinitely better game. I'm telling you. I mean,

01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:56.140
I mean, if you open it up and it was no me Maloney, like fuck. Yeah, that was worth it.

01:48:56.140 --> 01:49:02.540
Oh my God. Why hasn't anyone made show girls the game? Why is this not, but we, we,

01:49:02.540 --> 01:49:07.500
where's telltale? Somebody get telltale on the line. We have had no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:13.260
Fuck this shit. We have had the drastic park. We've had Batman. We've had walking dead.

01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:17.420
The type of controversial content we need on steam. You know what we need? The one thing

01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:25.340
that can bring gamers together in the year 2018 telltale games presents show girls the game

01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:32.060
in five different episodes. Absolutely. I'm so, Oh God, I'm sorry. Each of the episodes

01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:38.060
can take place in different locations, different places. You might say, yes. The first,

01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:44.460
first episode back East where back East different places. You guys, if you've never seen the movie

01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:51.980
show girls, I it's so bad, but it's so bad that it's kind of, is that a show that they do live?

01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:57.420
Why isn't that a thing that we do at dragon con? Why isn't there like a panel room that we do for,

01:49:57.420 --> 01:50:01.820
who do I have to call it? Dragon con to like get a room for two hours where we're going to do a

01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:09.020
screening of show girls and just get super drunk and cackle at how bad show girls is. That's a

01:50:09.020 --> 01:50:14.940
thing I need to happen. That's just like a meetup. I guess you could do, I guess anyway. Um,

01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:20.700
anyways, before we got off on weird tangents. Oh yeah. The goddess, the game. Yes. We never,

01:50:20.700 --> 01:50:26.620
it did come out in 2013 and has a whopping five of a 10 rating on steam. It's because it's garbage.

01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:31.660
It has anyone understood that Peter Molyneaux is full of shit when it comes to his hyping of games?

01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:35.420
Well, he made a good game called black or white a long time ago and fable was pretty good too.

01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:41.900
But every time the dog, the dog is going to be fucking epic. It's a fucking AI dog. It doesn't,

01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:49.900
it's stupid. Oh, you can pet that dog. Who gives a shit? Um, I don't know, but whatever. So anyways,

01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:53.980
giant alien cube. Don't know what it's going to be, but eventually, you know, I'm sure we'll find

01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:58.700
out what the hell does alien cube is all about and it'll be some sort of update or patch or

01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:03.100
new mode or whatever who gives a shit. So that's going to be coming out at some point soon.

01:51:03.980 --> 01:51:08.060
And of course with fortnight though, they are trying to get you to turn on two factor

01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:13.180
authentication and what's kind of cool is if you do turn it on, you get your own emote for doing

01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:19.820
that. So that's pretty cool. Uh, Bobby in our chat room would like to point out goddess costs more

01:51:19.820 --> 01:51:28.140
than the last remnant on steam right now. Just, just in case you're wondering, it's garbage.

01:51:29.100 --> 01:51:34.700
It's fucking garbage. All right, well, uh, Loki is probably going to keep right on that

01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:39.500
attitude when we talk about another story involving switch online service. So here's

01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:46.140
the deal. It was apparently confirmed that you will be able to use voice chat with the NES games

01:51:46.140 --> 01:51:51.740
on the switch online mobile app. You know, if you're not figuring out discord by now or anything,

01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:56.380
we have already heard that the Diablo three eternal collection will support switch online

01:51:56.380 --> 01:52:00.940
mobile app for the voice chat in the game. Uh, that would be the second confirmed game beyond

01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:05.820
splatoon two. Also any S games are going to do the same. And that is according to Nintendo's

01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:10.220
official websites. This isn't rumors or anything. Uh, in the little, uh, section on the website,

01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:16.780
it says with online play added to every classic game, you can compete or cooperate online with

01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:22.300
friends, share your screen. That one's kind of different to a little new, uh, or pass the

01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:27.900
controller depending on the game. That's something too low key where maybe what they're doing with

01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:32.620
the one player games is that you can kind of, if you're having problems getting past a certain

01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:36.380
part, you let your friend take over for a bit, clear that part and then take it back. Which,

01:52:37.100 --> 01:52:46.060
although that is something that's already done on, uh, Playstations immediate that, that thing on

01:52:46.060 --> 01:52:50.620
the PlayStation share play, even though it's already done on share play, uh, Nintendo is

01:52:50.620 --> 01:52:54.140
going to have something like that too, which is fine. That's fine. That's cool for Nintendo,

01:52:54.140 --> 01:52:57.820
uh, at least for the classic NES games, not confirming that for all games, just the classic

01:52:57.820 --> 01:53:04.940
NES games. Uh, and then it says with the Nintendo switch online smartphone app, you can also voice

01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:10.860
chat during your play sessions. So there you go. Uh, if you feel like downloading the app on your

01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:15.820
phone to get ready for that, that's fine. Uh, again, I will point out, um, not only do we have

01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:21.900
a discord that has chat rooms in it, um, probably a lot of people, you know, have their own discord

01:53:21.900 --> 01:53:26.460
chords with chat rooms in them that I think a lot of people are using instead, but we'll see,

01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:30.780
maybe there'll be an update to that Nintendo app that just makes it, Oh my God, amazing.

01:53:30.780 --> 01:53:38.060
But, um, yeah, not gonna, not gonna hype that up. If, if we exist in a world where Fortnite didn't

01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:43.580
exist on the switch and then we weren't aware that the switch was actually capable of running voice

01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:50.220
chat through the switch, I might be fine with that, but we don't live in that world. We live

01:53:50.220 --> 01:53:56.460
in a world where it fucking works with Fortnite, a completely more graphically intensive game that

01:53:56.460 --> 01:54:03.260
uses much more of the processing power for the game. You're telling me that a fucking NES ROM,

01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:10.060
with multiplayer, can't fucking handle voice chat through the God. It's so stupid. I get it. It's

01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:15.660
an API or something that they're allowing people to support through their stupid app. But it seems

01:54:15.660 --> 01:54:22.060
like it's almost like an excuse to say, Hey, look, we have an app. Ooh, we have this app. You don't

01:54:22.060 --> 01:54:27.820
need the fucking app because guess what? The system's capable of doing it, but yet for some

01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:34.380
stupid way, we got to make it really fucking difficult for you to do. It's like, how the fuck

01:54:34.380 --> 01:54:38.700
am I supposed to patch in the audio from people talking? Like I got to get fucking splitter

01:54:38.700 --> 01:54:45.580
between two different sources. It's stupid. It is goddamn stupid. I get it. There's other

01:54:46.540 --> 01:54:51.500
things we could use in place of it, but why should we be using other things in place of it?

01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:56.620
Just use the actual service that they have. I don't understand what the point is. It's dumb.

01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:03.740
Sorry. In chat, we're making up titles for your second rant tonight.

01:55:04.620 --> 01:55:08.140
That's only the second one? Come on. It's been more than two.

01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:12.540
Start it. So you started off Loki rant to electric boogaloo. So I followed that up with

01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:17.740
Loki rant to the secret of the ooze. Look, you ran to back in the habit. Loki rant to

01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:22.220
burritos quest like Simon's quest, but anyway, forget it. All right.

01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:31.980
Let's move on. You've got the next story actually, Loki. So take it away.

01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:40.700
Okay. So let's talk a little bit about Pokemon. And we mentioned earlier when we were talking

01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:46.380
about Switch that they do non-gaming things sometimes. And one thing they've been doing

01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:52.460
is these long television marathons. And so they're doing that again, this time with the

01:55:52.460 --> 01:56:00.380
Pokemon series, they're actually going to be streaming the first 932 episodes as well as,

01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:06.860
I believe 16 movies in this as well. It made so many fucking Pokemon movies. Oh my God.

01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:12.860
Yes. Like every legendary has their own movie. 16 movies. But they're doing something on top

01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:17.500
of that, which is kind of cool. And I'm kind of sad that I can't really participate for a long

01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:23.260
time in this, but during the actual marathon, they're going to have Pokemon pop up on the

01:56:23.260 --> 01:56:29.980
screen. And if you mouse over them, you can catch them as like, you're doing like, um,

01:56:31.580 --> 01:56:35.980
almost like you're catching, you have your own pokey decks and stuff like that.

01:56:35.980 --> 01:56:41.580
And you can play that. So that's kind of cool. So yeah, they're going to be, um, doing,

01:56:42.460 --> 01:56:45.980
geez, quite a few things. I don't know if they're playing the movies right after everything,

01:56:45.980 --> 01:56:49.660
or they're just kind of integrating that together. But, um, it says apparently,

01:56:49.820 --> 01:56:54.460
yeah, they're going to, it's going to be, how long is this going to go?

01:56:54.460 --> 01:57:00.380
I'm going to have to be a couple months for that many episodes and movies. It's going to be awhile.

01:57:03.580 --> 01:57:09.580
Oh yeah. The live stream says we'll begin August 27th and last into 2019. Oh my God. Yeah. No

01:57:09.580 --> 01:57:14.220
surprise. No surprise. Uh, looking in chat at live.vognetwork.com. Uh, Bobby Blackwell says,

01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:19.180
uh, Twitch actually has two channels that just do TV marathons. We just don't report on most

01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:22.940
of them. They did Knight Rider and nobody said a thing. Yeah. I actually just randomly had it

01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:26.940
on the other day. They were doing Korean dramas. Like, I don't know if I was on the right Twitch,

01:57:26.940 --> 01:57:30.700
like the main one or whatever, but like it was just on my front page of suggested stuff.

01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:35.900
And I was like, uh, they were, they were doing Korean dramas, but with English subtitles and,

01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:39.980
you know, Korean dramas are kind of great. So I actually did watch a little bit of the one I was

01:57:39.980 --> 01:57:43.260
like the way, the way they're kind of edited, they're kind of like the best things about

01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:47.900
telenovelas as well as like, you know, the stuff we do here with like this whole other, like

01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:52.380
dramatic spin put on them. So yeah, Korean dramas are great. So the marathon is this,

01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:59.100
it'll start 1 PM Eastern time on August 27th and says, um, with episode one of the Indigo

01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:05.020
league series or season. And apparently with that says from there, they're going to run for eight

01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:10.460
hours Monday through Thursday with Friday and Saturday reserved for reruns and the movies

01:58:10.460 --> 01:58:16.940
airing every Sunday at one. And then, um, with that, I guess, yeah, they have this Pokemon badge

01:58:16.940 --> 01:58:22.540
collector. So that's that whole thing where you'd be able to, uh, collect Pokemon by filling out

01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:27.340
your pokey decks, by clicking the icons that appear on the screen at certain times, this is

01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:33.580
each one gives you a certain amount of points, more points earned, uh, for rare Pokemon. And

01:58:33.580 --> 01:58:39.900
says, while these points will feed into an overall leaderboard, it's not clear what it's for. Neat.

01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:48.860
All right. Go ahead. I guess. All right. Uh, let's talk about a new game and this is, uh,

01:58:48.860 --> 01:58:53.580
a new game that is going to be from the makers of Until Dawn. That's that the creators of Until

01:58:53.580 --> 01:58:59.900
Dawn are coming back with a series called the Dark Pictures Anthology. Uh, Supermassive Games,

01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:04.460
of course, is the developer behind Until Dawn and they are launching what's called the Dark Pictures

01:59:04.460 --> 01:59:10.140
Anthology. It's a collection of various self-contained titles that will take on different

01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:14.860
horror genres. They're not saying if this is connected to the Until Dawn universe or not,

01:59:14.860 --> 01:59:17.980
they kind of have a very similar look. It looks like they're doing that same type of

01:59:17.980 --> 01:59:23.420
capture of the actors and actresses. It kind of reminds me that when they were talking about it,

01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:29.500
it kind of sounds like, um, American horror story almost. Yeah. Like it's like, it's like a serial

01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:34.060
basically, but like different. Yeah. So it's kind of cool. Well, the first game in this anthology

01:59:34.060 --> 01:59:38.860
is going to be called Man of Medan and it's going to be in 2019 when this comes out. And it's a

01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:44.220
group of Americans who find a ghost ship, which will have the game's namesake vessel while they

01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:49.660
are on a diving trip to a World War II wreck. And they will find out that they are not alone

01:59:49.660 --> 01:59:55.740
in this deserted vessel. Now, just like you kind of got used to an Until Dawn, every character in

01:59:55.740 --> 02:00:02.460
the game can live or die depending on how you play. Uh, no pressure whatsoever. So it can just,

02:00:02.700 --> 02:00:07.980
it can be a very, very sad short film when everybody dies or it can be very happy because

02:00:07.980 --> 02:00:13.420
everybody will live. So there you go. Anyway. Um, they're not saying how many games they're going

02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:17.660
to put in this anthology. I think they're leaving it open-ended. Uh, but Pete Samuels,

02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:23.260
who's the head of Supermassive said there are 39 stories they would like to represent within,

02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:27.100
you know, now I don't think they're going to do that many. That's a lot of games, but you know,

02:00:27.260 --> 02:00:31.980
they, they have a, a nice, nice brainstorming list to pick from. So we'll see what else comes

02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:36.140
out in that. So yeah, dungeon buster and chat at live.vognetwork.com says that the horror

02:00:36.140 --> 02:00:39.100
anthology sounds like a neat approach and it's going to be cool that it's going to be

02:00:39.100 --> 02:00:43.020
multi-platform too. Yes, it is. Multi-platform will not be limited to PlayStation this time.

02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:48.940
It's going to be also on PC and Xbox one. I just hope they get back to, um,

02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:52.140
another rush of blood game. Cause I need another rush of blood game.

02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:56.300
Well, I don't even think Supermassive did anything really with that. Maybe

02:00:56.300 --> 02:00:59.420
the site beyond assets. I'm pretty sure somebody else must have developed that.

02:00:59.420 --> 02:01:04.140
I still want more. And you know what? I'm fine with even taking not necessarily that,

02:01:04.140 --> 02:01:10.060
but like the whole rollercoaster gun range game. I'll take that. I'll just take another of that.

02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:15.260
Whatever. I would just take Pokemon snap and VR. Yeah. Oh my God. Pokemon snap too, too,

02:01:15.260 --> 02:01:19.740
too bad. We're talking about a Nintendo game on a Sony thing, but like a Pokemon snap game

02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:25.820
with that type of like VR thing, it would be pretty awesome. How about brutal Mon snap?

02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:32.140
You know, um, one of the things that I remember, I don't remember this as a story we talked about,

02:01:32.140 --> 02:01:37.100
but data miners did go into some of the Nintendo switch firmwares and they're still mentioning

02:01:37.100 --> 02:01:45.180
stuff of VR in there. So, Oh yeah. I've heard about, I don't know. I can't imagine with

02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:50.300
the screen that they have right now that that would be too good. Um, but I feel like that's

02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:55.980
one of those things where if they go to a switch deluxe or a switch thing in the future, maybe

02:01:55.980 --> 02:02:02.380
that'll be the thing is like the, this, the turbo powered switch will be a switch VR. Maybe Nintendo

02:02:02.380 --> 02:02:07.740
is leaving themselves some options. Maybe they're waiting to see how VR gets adopted or what they

02:02:07.740 --> 02:02:13.100
can do with it. So maybe that's one door that they're leaving opened a little bit. You know,

02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:16.140
maybe they won't do it for the next system, but they probably have some different ideas

02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:21.340
out there right now. Yeah. All right. Uh, let's just do a couple more stories and we're going

02:02:21.340 --> 02:02:27.180
to open up the Skype line at orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype. All right. Well,

02:02:27.180 --> 02:02:31.980
let's talk about a new Kickstarter game. I know we all love talking about Kickstarter games,

02:02:31.980 --> 02:02:36.940
but this one's called super patriotic dating simulator because there's dating simulators

02:02:36.940 --> 02:02:43.100
about everything. But apparently this is the first, um, they said it's the first generation

02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:49.420
Iranian American. Uh, they're talking about Carly as Malali, um, who apparently worked at cards

02:02:49.420 --> 02:02:54.620
against humanity. So, you know, kind of already the type of humor that you might expect in a game

02:02:54.620 --> 02:03:01.420
like this. Um, but to long story short, it's basically, um, dating members of ISIS to kill

02:03:01.420 --> 02:03:07.340
them. It's kind of weird. Like you fuck them to death, I guess. I don't really know what,

02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:19.420
um, yeah. Video games are sure art, aren't they? Yes. Let me read some of these screenshot quotes

02:03:19.420 --> 02:03:27.580
because this is awesome. And this is, was it Cali? I'm just worried you might be using me.

02:03:27.580 --> 02:03:32.620
I'm tired of casual sex and beheadings. I want something that's meaningful,

02:03:32.620 --> 02:03:38.060
something that will last only then will I give you my gift or let's, uh, this way.

02:03:38.860 --> 02:03:45.980
It's just a heavy Simtar and I get pretty sweaty practicing my moves. Do you think it's too much?

02:03:45.980 --> 02:03:52.060
Excuse me for being so juicy in front of you. Can somebody just clip that?

02:03:52.060 --> 02:03:58.620
Oh yes. So we can put that in a future YYR game or something. I don't know. All right.

02:03:58.620 --> 02:04:02.540
So it's just, I think it's just, it's like a dating Sim parody. That's just like,

02:04:03.100 --> 02:04:06.860
it's satire obviously. And it's just more of, um,

02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:14.220
it's just weird sense of humor. I think it's let's, let's just be, let's just not kid ourselves.

02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:18.780
It's kind of garbage. It's just some garbage going on Kickstarter. That's getting everybody

02:04:18.780 --> 02:04:24.380
talking because it's like fucking crazy. Can we get, how fucking crazy can we get?

02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:28.860
And so we got really high pigeon. This is what came up. We thought dating pigeons was

02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:35.260
the barrel bottom. I guess that's true. All right. Well, before we get to the Skype line,

02:04:35.260 --> 02:04:40.780
let's talk about video game sales. And so the NPD numbers for July, not that sales are everything,

02:04:40.780 --> 02:04:45.900
but remember in June it was kind of interesting because the classic NES was the top selling

02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:51.900
system of the month. Well, that did not happen this time. This time, the Switch, I believe was

02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:58.060
the best-selling piece of hardware. Yes. Based on units sold and dollar sales. So it is back on top.

02:04:58.700 --> 02:05:04.700
PlayStation 4 is still the best-selling console year to date. Xbox One is still up 60% year to

02:05:04.700 --> 02:05:11.020
date and 50% in July. So, you know, everybody's kind of doing pretty well there. And what's also

02:05:11.020 --> 02:05:18.220
kind of the real part worth mentioning here, the top-selling game of July, 2018, I would say is a

02:05:18.220 --> 02:05:24.220
little bit surprising. The top-selling game of July was Octopath Traveler on the Switch. So,

02:05:24.860 --> 02:05:30.060
you know, this was a title that I think was a little more experimental in nature by Square.

02:05:30.060 --> 02:05:39.100
So I think needless to say, it's mission successful. I'm glad to do well. Not to downplay it,

02:05:39.100 --> 02:05:45.580
but July is a very slow month. But, I mean, it's nice to see that that game did well because I

02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:51.420
would like to see more games like that come out. Yeah. Well, the second best-selling title for July

02:05:51.420 --> 02:05:57.260
was Grand Theft Auto 5. Still, all this time later. I mean, keep adding stuff to it. Well,

02:05:57.260 --> 02:06:01.580
those games just never gonna die. It sells and sells and sells and sells. And then number three,

02:06:01.580 --> 02:06:06.460
Mario Kart 8. Again, how long has that game been out? And it's still selling like crazy.

02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:12.060
I'm surprised. Number four, the Crash Bandicoot Insane Trilogy. Number five,

02:06:12.060 --> 02:06:15.260
Zelda Breath of the Wild. As people are getting these switches, they're buying the must-have

02:06:15.260 --> 02:06:22.060
games. Number six, Far Cry 5. Number seven, Super Mario Odyssey. Number eight, The Crew 2. Number

02:06:22.060 --> 02:06:29.820
nine, Tom Clancy Rainbow Six Siege. And number 10, Mario Tennis Aces. So, I mean, you kind of have

02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:34.700
a mix of like some new stuff, but then like just stuff that's been up there for a long, long time.

02:06:34.700 --> 02:06:40.220
I'm trying to look down the list. They have the top 20 and 19 is Minecraft. Still,

02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:45.420
still like who doesn't own Minecraft at this point? They just, well, Minecraft, I mean,

02:06:45.420 --> 02:06:50.220
they were releasing new updates and everything. True. So they just have the, you know, aquatic

02:06:50.220 --> 02:06:55.660
update. And so that kind of pushed it a little up to the forefront. By the way, did you do any

02:06:55.660 --> 02:06:59.900
looking into a Realm stuff? Cause I remember we were talking about that. I didn't end up,

02:06:59.900 --> 02:07:03.420
cause I ended up going out after the show last week. So I didn't really get into the Realm stuff.

02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:06.940
And then I was thinking about doing it tonight, but I'm off to DragonCon in like two days.

02:07:06.940 --> 02:07:10.220
So I don't want to start it now. So unfortunately is going to need to wait till I get back from

02:07:10.220 --> 02:07:14.300
DragonCon. But then I pro I was thinking about it and I was like, Oh, I do. I want to get that

02:07:14.300 --> 02:07:17.900
started. But then it was like, well, maybe I'll do that after OLR on Sunday. And then I was like,

02:07:17.900 --> 02:07:21.180
wait a minute. That would be like a horrible time to start it. Cause you'll come back in like four

02:07:21.180 --> 02:07:26.700
days and Loki will have ruined everything while you were gone. I'm just joking. I'm joking. But

02:07:26.700 --> 02:07:31.580
you know what I mean? Like, it's like, Oh, I will have had hardly any time to play. So we'll do that

02:07:31.580 --> 02:07:35.020
when I get back. We only built the giant snowman death machine one time.

02:07:36.620 --> 02:07:40.940
All right. We are going to open up the Skype line. It is open now for your calls at orange

02:07:40.940 --> 02:07:44.860
lounge radio, all one word on Skype. If you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've

02:07:44.860 --> 02:07:47.900
talked about tonight, or maybe you have something else you'd like to bring up. Maybe there's a new

02:07:47.900 --> 02:07:51.740
story we haven't touched on yet that you want to talk about. Orange lounge radio, all one word on

02:07:51.740 --> 02:07:56.940
Skype. It is open now. While we see if anybody's going to call in tonight, Loki, do you have any,

02:07:56.940 --> 02:08:00.780
remember this your last chance for two weeks? Uh, Loki, do you have any last minute stories

02:08:00.780 --> 02:08:08.300
or things we haven't talked about yet? Um, I did not at the moment have anything to talk about.

02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:12.220
Well, lucky you, cause we're getting a phone call coming in. So hi, you're on orange launch radio.

02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:23.740
Who's this? Hola, it's orange lounge radio. Your audio is not working. We cannot hear you.

02:08:25.420 --> 02:08:27.420
Have you tried turning it off and then on again?

02:08:27.420 --> 02:08:34.540
I did uninstall a Pokemon go and it seems to work better now. Did it really? Yeah. Hopefully

02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:39.740
that person will see, you know, give it more. Yeah. You wait, wait until you're trying to

02:08:39.740 --> 02:08:44.540
run remnant. I know I bought this. I remember having it, but maybe I'm stuck on this. Are

02:08:44.540 --> 02:08:49.100
you sure it wasn't on the three 60? I thought about that. Maybe I got it free with like the

02:08:49.100 --> 02:08:53.100
games of the gold stuff. And so maybe that's what I'm thinking of. Was it a games of gold thing?

02:08:53.100 --> 02:08:59.420
Is it backwards? But this may have been before they were backwards compatible. Maybe I'm not

02:08:59.420 --> 02:09:11.580
sure. It was, um, yeah, I don't see it unless it's under L and last word. No, no. Apparently

02:09:11.580 --> 02:09:18.780
you don't have it. Maybe I did have it, but Oh, well who cares? A little late now. It's 10 bucks.

02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:24.300
That's too much for me to pay for a 10 year old game. Uh, are there any, uh, I'm trying to think

02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:28.380
like what's on my steam wishlist these days. I still feel like I have some games on there that I

02:09:28.380 --> 02:09:32.220
want to get around to playing, but you know, I just, a lot of stuff that I think is on my

02:09:32.220 --> 02:09:37.100
steam wishlist is stuff that I own on console. I want to get in the streaming, but I don't have

02:09:37.100 --> 02:09:43.580
a place to do that. And that's my problem right now. So, um, I thought about moving everything

02:09:43.580 --> 02:09:50.700
into the garage, but I don't want to sit on the garage. Yeah, well we did orange launch radio in

02:09:50.700 --> 02:09:55.420
a garage for a long time. Remember your garage wasn't as bad as my garage. It was at least had

02:09:55.420 --> 02:10:01.660
that garage where the, the shell or the, um, bench that I have work bench, the cat box is right

02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:08.860
underneath it. So that's nice. And also right now my work bench is covered with my 3d printer stuff,

02:10:09.580 --> 02:10:16.620
which is all over the place. And so, yeah, didn't do anything with that 3d printer either,

02:10:16.620 --> 02:10:20.060
which is unfortunate because it was like, Oh yeah, I'm going to build a console like the switch.

02:10:20.060 --> 02:10:23.260
Then I got switched. I'm like, well, I don't have to do that anymore. Oh yeah. I'm going to use it

02:10:23.260 --> 02:10:27.020
to build DDR pets. Then I got DDR machine. Well, don't need to do that anymore. Well,

02:10:27.020 --> 02:10:32.700
shit. I don't know what I'm gonna use this for anymore. So yeah, well, um, my number one, uh,

02:10:32.700 --> 02:10:36.380
my wishlist right now is donut country. So I'll probably pick that up. You know, obviously next,

02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:40.700
I can't find my wishlist on the mobile app. Can you not access your wishlist?

02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:47.180
I still have monsters and monocles on my wishlist. I should probably pick that up because,

02:10:47.180 --> 02:10:51.740
you know, we want to support local indie developers. And that game, he, I don't think

02:10:51.740 --> 02:10:57.180
they've ever put it on sale, but you know what? I, I'm kinda, I'm, I'm okay with that. Like,

02:10:57.180 --> 02:11:00.860
I think especially for like, especially indie devs, like I'm okay. If you want to make that

02:11:00.860 --> 02:11:04.860
decision that you're never going to put your game on sale, like, you know, buy it for this or don't

02:11:04.860 --> 02:11:10.380
buy it. Yeah. Don't sit around and wait for something. As you 100 Matt points out, I will

02:11:10.380 --> 02:11:14.700
watch a Loki stream of anything. All right. I'm going to hope that some calls get in. I'm going

02:11:14.700 --> 02:11:18.940
to give it one more chance here. Orange launch radio, all one word on Skype. It's just, I can't,

02:11:18.940 --> 02:11:22.300
I could stream stuff, but I wouldn't be able to talk over it because I would be,

02:11:23.100 --> 02:11:29.100
um, getting in the way with, it would be too loud. All right. Let's try this again. Hi,

02:11:29.100 --> 02:11:33.500
you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? I hate Skype with a passion. We have made it.

02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:41.020
How are you buddy? I'm pretty good. I, I'm kind of frazzled about today. Not really shell shocked,

02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:48.700
but it's just got me reflecting. I think that's a good word for it. Reflective. Yes. Yes. Well,

02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:52.620
what's on your mind? What did you want to call about tonight? Oh, three things. One,

02:11:53.180 --> 02:11:58.940
let's get the giant pink elephant out of the room. Cause I'll make this as quick as possible

02:11:58.940 --> 02:12:05.100
in regards to something that I posted on my fan page. I remember, you know, as a kid playing

02:12:05.100 --> 02:12:10.460
Nintendo friends coming over playing Nintendo cousins coming over and playing Nintendo,

02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:16.060
we would do our own home tournament thing and stuff. And yeah, we'd get mad,

02:12:16.700 --> 02:12:23.020
throw controllers. We fight, you know, I mean, but then we realize, you know,

02:12:23.020 --> 02:12:30.620
stop, relax, you know, it's just a game. We'd apologize. And we continue playing. It's like,

02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:37.500
and as we got older, it was like, yeah, we did this, but we always threw our fists up. It was

02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:46.700
no reason, you know, for this, you know, and I, that's what got me like reflecting and I'm seeing

02:12:47.660 --> 02:12:57.180
what's going on. It's like the times are changed. It's like, you lost, take the L, move on. I get

02:12:57.180 --> 02:13:04.540
it. I understand it, but I sure as fuck do not agree with what happened. There are better ways

02:13:04.540 --> 02:13:11.980
to handle this much better ways. I just, you know, that the asshole took his own life. So we can't

02:13:11.980 --> 02:13:16.460
even ask what the fuck were you thinking? You know, he's a fucking coward, plain and simple.

02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:21.020
And there's a meme going around. They're saying, don't mention his name, call him what he is,

02:13:21.020 --> 02:13:23.580
bitch boy. And you know what? That's exactly what I call him.

02:13:24.860 --> 02:13:30.540
I, yeah, I don't, yeah, I don't feel like glamorizing him or his name or anything like

02:13:30.540 --> 02:13:35.100
that, you know, especially during this time. It's just, it's just, but I think like you,

02:13:35.100 --> 02:13:39.260
I just have so many questions. Like, I'm just so frustrated that, you know, this guy, you know,

02:13:39.260 --> 02:13:45.180
did what he did and then isn't gonna, you know, does, does this where he can't answer questions

02:13:45.260 --> 02:13:49.660
that we can try to prevent it again? Like, what made you even fucking think that this was a

02:13:49.660 --> 02:13:52.220
rational response to a situation? You know what I mean?

02:13:56.220 --> 02:14:00.220
To what you were saying before about, you know, this coming into our community,

02:14:00.860 --> 02:14:07.500
this has been on the edge of our community for a while. We're going back to the, to the two guys

02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:13.020
that threatened to shoot up a Pokemon tournament in Boston. And thankfully the police followed that

02:14:13.020 --> 02:14:18.940
and stopped them. Let us not forget that you had that one cracked out dude who wanted to go after

02:14:18.940 --> 02:14:25.340
Jason David Frank at that Comic-Con. And now I'm hearing rumblings in the cosplay community that,

02:14:25.340 --> 02:14:29.340
Oh, they're going to get, they're getting all upset because, because what's going on

02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:33.820
is there'll be more security at the, at the convention centers and the hotels.

02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:37.900
And they're not going to be able to take, bring their props and certain stuff in. And I'm like,

02:14:37.980 --> 02:14:43.100
as a friend of mine said, if you are more concerned about the fact that you cannot bring

02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:49.020
your prop into a location because of security issues, you need to get out of the community

02:14:49.020 --> 02:14:54.140
in a heartbeat. You just need to go because it's not about you. It's about everybody else.

02:14:55.580 --> 02:15:01.100
Yeah. I it's, it's just a prop. And honestly, if you took a big fluorescent plastic sword or

02:15:01.100 --> 02:15:04.940
whatever, whatever that is they're banning, you know, I think people would understand

02:15:04.940 --> 02:15:09.180
what it's supposed to represent and not like, you know, people are not going to be like,

02:15:09.180 --> 02:15:13.260
Oh, I can't believe they didn't have something lifelike with what's going on in the world today.

02:15:13.260 --> 02:15:16.780
You know, do a photo shoot or something where you can do those things, you know,

02:15:16.780 --> 02:15:23.180
you can, you'll be, your Instagram will be fine. Yeah. And the last thing I want to say

02:15:23.180 --> 02:15:27.900
real quick before I get out of here, in regards to Twitch and the different things that's on there,

02:15:27.900 --> 02:15:33.820
one of our staffers, one of our co-hosts, Ichigo, she goes on Twitch from time to time,

02:15:34.540 --> 02:15:39.020
under the creative section, does a live stream of her work in progress of her cosplay. So that's

02:15:39.020 --> 02:15:43.900
really cool. Oh yeah. Yeah. I've heard costume makers and costume processing and stuff is a,

02:15:43.900 --> 02:15:48.300
is another kind of side to Twitch. That's pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah. Cause you know,

02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:52.140
as I'm going to conventions and stuff, I'm like, I would like to jump on Twitch and

02:15:52.860 --> 02:15:57.740
unlike Ari, I'm not going to, I really can't sit here and play video games all day. I mean,

02:15:57.740 --> 02:16:02.540
I could probably do a stream of me, you know, working in Lightroom and talking to people as I'm

02:16:02.540 --> 02:16:07.580
editing these photos or just taking out the laptop and running a live stream of the conventions

02:16:07.580 --> 02:16:11.660
masquerade and just stuff like that, which is really cool, you know? Yeah.

02:16:14.300 --> 02:16:19.340
Yeah. I, there's, there's a lot of experimental stuff you can do on Twitch. And I think that

02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:24.540
side of it's just really going to grow, you know? Definitely. And let's see where it takes us,

02:16:24.540 --> 02:16:29.740
you know? Absolutely. Who knows what might show up on Twitch in the future. Anything's possible.

02:16:29.740 --> 02:16:35.260
All right. We'll see you later, my friend. Take care. One more thing before I go. I just

02:16:35.260 --> 02:16:38.620
need one quick favor for you. Yeah, of course. Have a drink for me this weekend.

02:16:39.740 --> 02:16:44.220
For you, buddy. I'll have two. I love you, man. All right. Take care, my friend.

02:16:45.820 --> 02:16:49.260
Bye. All right. We'll see if anybody else wants to get, that was the call I was trying to get in

02:16:49.260 --> 02:16:52.460
earlier, but we'll see if anybody else wants to get in real quick. Orange Lounge Radio,

02:16:52.460 --> 02:16:57.820
all one word on Skype. Um, anything you wanted to talk about that you found during the call there?

02:16:57.820 --> 02:17:01.660
No, I'm just reading up on Minecraft Realms. Oh, really? It's actually up to 11. Well,

02:17:01.660 --> 02:17:07.180
it's total 11 players. If you get the jumbo one, it's 11. You can only, or is it that many people

02:17:07.180 --> 02:17:11.580
at once? Or you can only invite 11 players simultaneous. Okay. How many people can you

02:17:11.580 --> 02:17:15.020
invite? I don't think there's a limit. Oh, that's good. Okay. Cause I don't want to be limited.

02:17:15.020 --> 02:17:19.980
Cause we never really did get that high concurrent player. So everyone plays at a different time

02:17:19.980 --> 02:17:24.380
usually. Right. But then the other thing too, that would be different now than when you had

02:17:24.380 --> 02:17:28.220
your own Minecraft server was that, you know, you kind of had to have that older Java edition

02:17:28.220 --> 02:17:32.060
of Minecraft, you know, which was all that you had at the time, because you had to have that.

02:17:32.060 --> 02:17:37.820
But now like with the realms, that's how you connect, not just PC Java version. Yeah. With

02:17:37.820 --> 02:17:42.380
the realms too, if you can, but I'm not going to separate. I'm not going to be because I want to

02:17:42.380 --> 02:17:47.740
be able to have the switch people with the windows 10 people with the X-Box people, sorry, PlayStation

02:17:47.740 --> 02:17:51.740
people, but that's Sony's problem. So, you know, everything, everything else have that all

02:17:51.740 --> 02:17:55.500
connected and, you know, so that people can play on whatever their devices. Cause I imagine there's

02:17:55.500 --> 02:17:59.660
a lot of people that are only playing Minecraft, like on the switch, you know, or only playing it.

02:17:59.660 --> 02:18:05.980
It's all the tablet and mobile stuff is all integrated to my kids play. Although my son

02:18:05.980 --> 02:18:09.180
doesn't really know how to play. He just kind of wonders. Well, actually, no, I take that back.

02:18:09.180 --> 02:18:13.580
I'm gonna see my oldest son, Josh. He's been playing on his tablet. I'm like, why aren't

02:18:13.580 --> 02:18:17.980
you playing on your computer? We got you a brand new laptop that runs my craft really well.

02:18:18.620 --> 02:18:24.140
You have an X-Box one controller. Why aren't you playing it on that? Like, I'm like, whatever.

02:18:24.140 --> 02:18:30.380
I don't want to play. So he's playing on his, um, I actually, I don't know if he's been,

02:18:30.380 --> 02:18:35.260
he's been playing it both on the tablet and on the switch. And he has like this, he built a bank with

02:18:35.260 --> 02:18:41.420
like, um, security cameras and stuff like that that he made and stuff. So he's been having fun

02:18:41.420 --> 02:18:47.500
with that. So once we get it set up, I'll have to invite him. All right. Well, uh, I guess that's

02:18:47.500 --> 02:18:52.540
going to do it for the show tonight. No other calls are coming in and we're going to be wrapping

02:18:52.540 --> 02:18:57.180
it up here for two weeks. We'll be back in a couple of weeks as dragon con is this weekend.

02:18:57.180 --> 02:19:02.140
I'm really excited about it. I wish you could go, Matt, but I understand why I wish I could go to.

02:19:02.780 --> 02:19:08.860
I know, but you got maybe when the kids are 18. All right. If I'm please sooner than that,

02:19:08.860 --> 02:19:12.060
we'll see. All right. Anyway. Uh, but that's going to do it for another episode. Orange

02:19:12.060 --> 02:19:15.580
Ontario. Hey, as I say at the end of every show, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Oil Art

02:19:15.580 --> 02:19:18.860
tonight, please tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the

02:19:18.860 --> 02:19:23.180
show where every gamer has a voice, but you know, if the voices aren't here to air, we don't have a

02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:28.700
lot left to air. So, uh, please tell a friend, uh, help us spread the word, uh, a nice five-star

02:19:28.700 --> 02:19:33.260
review on a place like iTunes or wherever it is you heard about this show. Those go an awfully

02:19:33.260 --> 02:19:37.580
long way as well. We appreciate it. Um, I guess that means we go around and get everybody's

02:19:37.580 --> 02:19:42.300
final thoughts. Uh, I'll start, I'll let Loki finish tonight. Uh, my final thought is this

02:19:42.300 --> 02:19:47.340
was definitely a show of downs and ups. So I just, again, you know, I know we had that email

02:19:47.340 --> 02:19:51.820
tonight that we all kind of, you know, giggled out with all the love, but I, I do appreciate you guys

02:19:51.820 --> 02:19:56.700
so much that, um, stick with us through, through everything through thick and thin and, uh, we'll

02:19:56.700 --> 02:20:01.820
get through it together. We always do. I'll leave it on that note. Loki, how about you? Your final

02:20:01.820 --> 02:20:07.340
thought? I keep working on building a game and keeps changing what I'm working on each week.

02:20:07.340 --> 02:20:09.980
That's the problem. Can't get started on anything because I keep changing.

02:20:09.980 --> 02:20:14.460
Cause you can't finish one idea. Well, I can't even say that. It's just like, I find,

02:20:14.460 --> 02:20:19.180
you know, what, like I'm running into, I still, I'm actually, it's the idea I'm working with now is

02:20:19.900 --> 02:20:25.820
it, I don't know. It's similar to what I had another idea I had before. And I even tried

02:20:25.820 --> 02:20:31.420
starting working on, uh, it's time the car again. And then I tried because I'm like,

02:20:31.420 --> 02:20:36.220
Oh yeah, I'll totally do it. Cause you know, unreal has a vehicle controller built into it.

02:20:36.220 --> 02:20:42.780
Let me try the vehicle controller. And Oh my God, is it crap? It is so crap. And I'm like,

02:20:42.780 --> 02:20:49.260
uh, no, I'm not going to fucking do that. So, um, yeah, but that may come later someday.

02:20:50.060 --> 02:20:54.620
All right. I'll look forward to it. Speaking of things that'll happen when the kids turn 18.

02:20:54.620 --> 02:20:58.620
All right. Uh, that's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio.

02:20:58.620 --> 02:21:03.500
We will be back in two weeks to do it all over again. Thank you guys so much for listening to

02:21:03.500 --> 02:21:07.020
the show. We really appreciate you guys. I hope to see many of you guys at dragon con,

02:21:07.020 --> 02:21:10.460
but if I'm not going to see you there, then I hope you have a great week gaming and
