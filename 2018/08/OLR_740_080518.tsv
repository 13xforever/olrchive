7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Tonight, Nintendo pioneered the ability to make people buy the same games all over again, but now they've been officially recognized for these feats on the second round of NES Classic Production. Flashback to the 1980s and join us for this along with the rest of the night's gaming news starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	53000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on August the 5th of 2018, episode number 740 of our show. Here over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. Myself, Rob Roberts, joined by DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
53000	56000	I'm arguing with my sum tables on numbers.
57000	59000	Are you spreadsheet warring?
59000	60000	I am spreadsheeting right now.
60000	61000	I see.
61000	63000	Because I have to track how much money I spend.
63000	67000	Don't they do full on games in Excel? Isn't that like a thing people do?
67000	70000	I know people do like Perler and knit patterns in Excel.
70000	77000	Oh, that makes a lot of sense actually to do like Perler patterns in Excel. Actually, our show role that lists all the stories we're going to do.
77000	79000	Oh, okay.
79000	87000	Yeah, that makes a lot of sense though because Excel is great for like grids. Although, technically, I don't use Excel to do the show role. I use that open office.
87000	91000	On my Mac it's numbers, on my PC it's open office.
91000	95000	So, there you go. Spreadsheets.
95000	98000	Except when people give me word for free or office for free.
98000	110000	No, I was doing my budget because I have to put what I spent in there, but I've used spreadsheets plenty of times with my collection to do our personal inventory at home, which we need to do a new one.
110000	115000	Especially now that we have pinballs to add to it, which we have a new pinball.
115000	116000	Congrats. What'd you get?
116000	117000	The Shadow.
117000	120000	Oh, wow. Like the Alec Baldwin movie from 94 or whatever?
120000	121000	Tim Curry.
121000	123000	Oh, that's right. Tim Curry was in that.
123000	124000	Tim Curry is on our pinball.
124000	126000	That's right. Oh, your pinball's been blessed.
126000	131000	But it's also a really interestingly built table.
131000	137000	Because it has like this upper section that you use like bumpers to get all these little targets.
137000	141000	I forgot what they call it. I've only seen that movie like once.
141000	147000	But anyway, that's our new table and we just gave back Whirlwind that we were borrowing for attorney.
147000	149000	Oh, I do like Whirlwind too though, but I understand.
149000	154000	Whirlwind had that little fan at the top that like when you get the bonus mode or whatever, it like blows air on you.
154000	158000	When you're in like some stinky, sweaty bar, like that thing feels really good.
158000	160000	You know what I mean? Because I think they had a Whirlwind.
160000	165000	There's this random bar in the Castro. I think Moby Dick's. You know the place I'm talking about, right?
165000	167000	I haven't been to Moby Dick's, but I know it.
167000	168000	I think they had it.
168000	169000	Yeah.
169000	170000	And that was one of the things.
170000	171000	You know what would make sense for them to have?
171000	172000	Huh?
172000	173000	A Fish Tales.
173000	179000	I know one of those bars in Castro had an Elvira table, which is very appropriate.
179000	186000	Now the Bolt, the leather bar in Sacramento, for those who don't know, has a Simpsons pinball party.
186000	188000	Oh, that's right. They do. That's right.
188000	191000	Pinball at bars. Fun. But I mean, that's kind of.
191000	198000	Not only can you play pinball, but you can see people getting fucked in the ass.
198000	201000	Well, no. Last time I was there, they had porn up on the TV.
201000	204000	Wow. Dark Sakura. Wow.
204000	208000	This is a show about video games. You take your filth elsewhere.
208000	212000	I'm just saying, last time I was there, that's what I saw on the TV.
212000	218000	I need somebody pure and wholesome to clean up this mess that Dark Sakura's leaving.
218000	220000	So say hello to Techmaster Loki.
220000	221000	Hello.
221000	222000	Hi, Loki. How are you?
222000	223000	Good.
223000	224000	Did you go to church today?
224000	226000	No.
226000	227000	Well, how are you doing?
227000	228000	I'm doing fine.
228000	233000	Yeah, what's new with you? Hopefully less bars and CD stories than what Dark Sakura's talking about.
233000	234000	Right.
234000	235000	Yeah.
236000	242000	I've been still working through my Unreal stuff, so I'm pretty much done with the lesson that I was on.
242000	246000	So are you doing the Cooking with Unity learnings?
246000	248000	Sorry, it's like a code-along. It's a Udemy course.
248000	250000	Oh, a code-along. Okay.
250000	251000	Type of thing.
251000	252000	Yeah.
252000	256000	But the guy, he makes mistakes, and I usually catch him when he makes them.
256000	258000	But that's like the best way to learn.
258000	262000	But yeah, it is. And then I like how he kind of also gives different instructions.
262000	266000	Like, okay, we've done this a couple times. Now I'm going to challenge you. Go do this.
266000	270000	And then he'll pause the video and go build this part out.
270000	274000	And then you're done. And then you unpause it, and you make sure you did everything correct.
274000	276000	And that seems to be pretty effective.
276000	281000	Plus, I also went through and tweaked some things, and I've even been commenting on the course.
281000	287000	Because I just got done with the audio portion of it, and he has a background track that plays.
288000	293000	Well, the way he triggered is, when basically the level starts, it plays the track.
293000	294000	Right.
294000	300000	But it doesn't loop it. So I'm like, well, you can do it this way, and it will loop it every time.
300000	304000	Interesting. So you're trying to one-up the teacher. No, I get it.
304000	309000	Well, I'm just suggesting that, and not to mention the track he made for the background.
309000	312000	Does it loop well, but hey, whatever.
312000	313000	Alright.
314000	322000	It's just what it is. It's just a really basic get to know Unreal thing.
322000	324000	And I've gotten to know Unreal.
324000	325000	Alright.
325000	328000	I just got an immediate announcement alert from Dan.
328000	330000	Oh boy, what?
330000	333000	A dude in the top eight is using Yamcha.
333000	339000	Okay, so I'm okay with this transition and your random interjection here.
339000	341000	Because I actually want to talk about Evo here at the top of the show.
341000	345000	Because obviously the Evo tournament is going on in Vegas right now.
345000	347000	Mandalay Bay is where they do that.
347000	348000	So Evo's happening right now.
348000	349000	Our buddy Alex is there.
349000	351000	Yeah, I know. I have a friend that's there too.
351000	353000	Actually, I know a few people that are there.
353000	356000	Good old Rob D from back in the All Games days.
356000	358000	I'm seeing his stuff on Facebook. He's there right now.
358000	361000	So anyhow, Evo's happening.
361000	366000	I must admit, I haven't been watching a lot of it, though I have been following some of the drama.
366000	369000	But you've been watching some of it, right, Jamie? What have you guys been watching?
369000	372000	We watched a few of the matches, like last night, when we couldn't get any sleep.
372000	379000	We were watching the Dragon Ball FighterZ play, watching some very interesting people.
379000	385000	This one guy busted out Ten Shinhan and was fucking kicking ass.
385000	390000	I mean, all these guys were like, Brawley, perfect sell. Brawley, perfect sell.
390000	395000	Dude busts out Ten Shinhan and owns. I'm like, yes!
395000	397000	Did you see some of the drama going on with Smash?
398000	404000	Oh man, the Smash Brothers stuff is pretty interesting because it came down to a Bayonetta versus Bayonetta fight.
404000	411000	And I guess some of the crowd is not super into that because I think some people feel Bayonetta is overpowered because of some of her combos and what have you.
411000	417000	So again, you will have to excuse me, fighting game fans and Smash community fans.
417000	421000	I'm not as up and up on what's going on, but I'm just kind of getting the cliff notes.
421000	425000	So apparently the crowd was booing what was going on.
425000	428000	But there was some interesting stuff that was happening with the contestants as well.
428000	435000	I don't know if it was because of the booing or what, but when one of the matches started, and this was like the finals, the final match.
435000	441000	They just stood there for like a minute and they didn't fight because the crowd was booing.
441000	445000	And so finally somebody came over and was like, you guys need to play.
445000	448000	And so they played, but there was something really interesting that happened.
448000	453000	One of the guys kind of accidentally fell or he lost his life falling off the edge.
453000	455000	It was like an accident, he wasn't supposed to do it.
455000	462000	So what happened is the other player just jumped off the ledge and traded life for life.
462000	466000	Which in the finals of a competitive thing, what in the heck?
466000	467000	That sportsmanship.
467000	473000	It is, but it's also like some people actually are viewing the stalemate that they were doing.
473000	476000	One of the guys flipped off the crowd as he walked off the stage.
476000	483000	They're seeing that as kind of like, basically kind of like everybody all around is being really immature.
483000	488000	Now to be fair, the contestants I believe are 16 and 17.
488000	493000	So I'll cut them some slack on the maturity because by definition they're not fully matured yet.
493000	498000	So that's fine, but the audience, like I know there's a lot of adults in the audience.
498000	499000	That's some bullshit.
499000	501000	And they need to like, I know.
501000	504000	You didn't get your way.
504000	507000	Or wah, Bayonetta is overpowered.
507000	511000	Well, I mean, then don't show up.
511000	513000	I don't know what to tell you.
513000	518000	Surely there is a character that counters Bayonetta.
518000	519000	Surely.
519000	521000	And again, I don't know my smash as well.
521000	523000	I agree, and don't call me Shirley.
523000	527000	But there must be a character that counters Bayonetta pretty effectively that you would pick
527000	530000	and maybe is not otherwise a stellar pick.
530000	532000	But if you wanted to take out a Bayonetta, you could do it.
532000	533000	I don't know.
533000	534000	Anyway.
534000	539000	Well, at any rate, Dan just messages me because he was like, I want to see someone in the top eight using Yamcha.
539000	542000	Well, someone's in the top eight using Yamcha.
542000	546000	We'll go into the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
546000	550000	where of course we do tape live at VOG Network every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
550000	552000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
552000	553000	And we do get some live comments.
553000	556000	Tigerclaw says the Smash Brothers community can be toxic.
556000	559000	SG100Matt says the whole community was shitty last night.
560000	563000	Tigerclaw says if you can't counter Bayonetta, you suck at Smash Brothers.
563000	564000	It's as simple as that.
564000	566000	But as SG100Matt points out, there isn't a counter.
566000	567000	That's part of the problem.
567000	569000	And well, here's the thing.
569000	572000	I don't want to blame an entire community
572000	575000	because I know people in the Smash Brothers community that are fucking awesome.
575000	580000	So I don't want to be all like the entire community is...
580000	586000	I'm not going to do that, but I am going to say that display of the community was poopy.
586000	591000	And so y'all need to have a come to Jesus moment and like figure out why...
591000	592000	Y'all need Satan.
594000	600000	You need to figure out why that's okay to like boo children.
600000	606000	I'm sorry, but 16 and 17 is still a child by legal definition.
606000	608000	Why it is okay to boo children.
608000	611000	And on top of that, I'm hearing shit about like death threats and shit
611000	613000	because of course we live in a social media era.
613000	614000	Of course.
614000	616000	You're sending death threats because they play the character you didn't like.
616000	617000	Oh my God.
617000	621000	How fucking cool are you sending death threats to a 16 year old?
621000	623000	Like, oh my God.
623000	625000	Can I have your babies now?
625000	627000	Where can I fuck this person?
627000	633000	So obviously heavy sense of sarcasm I hope is clearly coming through.
633000	635000	None of this is acceptable.
635000	642000	So we need the decent Smash Brothers people to like kick those other people out.
642000	648000	But to be fair, this is a problem that is not unique to Smash Brothers.
648000	652000	This is a problem we have in the gaming community that's a little bigger than this.
652000	655000	I don't know if we can answer this on a three hour show,
655000	660000	but it is going to take the less shitty people to stand up and say,
660000	662000	Hey, stop being shitty.
662000	665000	That's just how these sorts of problems get fixed.
665000	667000	You have to call out.
667000	669000	I mean, this goes, this goes for a lot of different things in life.
669000	675000	Like, um, I don't want to get too deep, but the reality is when it comes to things like racism.
675000	676000	Okay.
676000	685000	Like it takes a unshitty non racist person to really stand out and call out the behavior of somebody who's being racist by saying,
685000	687000	Hey, you're being racist and that sucks.
687000	690000	And if you keep doing that, I'm not going to be your friend.
690000	692000	It takes that to like counter that.
692000	695000	Or as in wonder shows him that's racist.
695000	696000	Sure.
696000	697000	Well, you know what?
697000	705000	Sometimes if you're at a bar and you see or out in public and you see a woman being harassed by some guy, you stand with her.
705000	706000	Yeah.
706000	707000	I mean, and that is so.
707000	717000	So honestly, the only reason I bring it up and go to that, like really like heavy place is because like this sort of behavior is not even necessarily unique to gaming culture,
717000	719000	although sadly it runs rampant in gaming culture.
719000	728000	But like this is, this is a society problem that has to be stopped, solved by less shitty people sticking up for people who are marginalized.
728000	732000	Standing up to it takes the kind of fortitude that takes some development.
732000	733000	Yes.
733000	738000	Anyway, a tire con chat says that, you know, this is going to continue with super smash brothers ultimate.
738000	740000	You know, these people will find something to bitch about.
740000	747000	Like then like don't throw, throw them out of the arena at Evo, throw them out.
747000	749000	Why are they there?
749000	753000	If they're going to sit there and boo and they're not enjoying it, then fucking get out.
753000	755000	Leave.
755000	757000	Nobody forced you to go to Vegas.
757000	763000	I'm sorry, but the stinky cunt gets the douche.
763000	764000	I'm in that kind of mood.
764000	766000	Why?
766000	768000	Why are you doing this tonight?
768000	772000	Because I'm in that kind of mood.
772000	773000	If they're going to be...
773000	774000	You can say that.
774000	775000	I can't.
775000	776000	If I said that, I get angry.
776000	777000	I get death threat tweets.
777000	778000	You can say that.
778000	782000	If they're going to be cunty, then treat them.
782000	784000	Actually, douches are bad for you.
784000	786000	So honestly, I think it is the worst insult.
786000	789000	Call someone a douche because douches are bad for you.
789000	790000	Oh my God.
790000	792000	If any episode ever deserved the explicit tag.
792000	793000	All right.
793000	795000	Anyhow, let's talk about...
795000	799000	I'm making up for your Blender on Bobby by making us worse.
799000	805000	Let's talk about some of the less explicit things coming out of EVO because there is
805000	806000	a lot of news happening.
806000	807000	Playing as Panda.
807000	808000	Okay.
808000	809000	In Tekken 7.
809000	811000	Oh, the competitor that was doing that?
811000	814000	The Panda was so cute against Devil Jin.
814000	816000	It was so cute.
816000	820000	The Devil Jin guy won, but the Panda player did pretty freaking well.
820000	821000	Yeah.
821000	825000	All the Tekken 7 hype and all the stuff that's happening around that at EVO and everything
825000	828000	is kind of reminding me like, oh yeah, Tekken 7 is supposed to be really good.
828000	829000	I need to pick that up at some point.
829000	835000	So I think I probably will because like many of you, I loved Tekken 1, 2, 3, and then kind
835000	838000	of maybe I looked at 4 and I kind of lost sight of the series.
838000	843000	So I need to come back to it with Tekken 7, which just before we went live tonight, apparently
843000	848000	they dropped a bombshell on season 2 characters for Tekken 7 and Anna is going to be there
848000	849000	because you have to have Anna.
849000	850000	Come on.
850000	851000	You have to have Anna.
851000	853000	Negan from The Walking Dead is like their next big crossover, which is...
853000	854000	Yeah, I know.
854000	856000	I don't watch Walking Dead, so I have no idea what that is.
856000	857000	I don't watch Walking Dead.
857000	858000	I don't watch Walking Dead.
858000	862000	He's the antagonist that carries the bat with the spikes on it.
862000	866000	Oh, played by, um, what's his face that played the dad on Supernatural.
866000	867000	Yes.
867000	868000	Jeffrey Dean Anderson.
868000	869000	Yeah, that's it.
869000	870000	So, him.
870000	871000	And the comedian.
871000	872000	Yes.
872000	873000	Is that the guy from Everybody Loves Raymond?
873000	875000	No, I don't think he's from Everybody Loves Raymond, no.
875000	876000	Or was he?
876000	877000	I don't know.
877000	878000	I just remember him from Supernatural.
878000	879000	Look up his bio.
879000	880000	Jeffrey Dean Morgan.
880000	881000	Now he's the brother from Everybody Loves Raymond.
881000	884000	I don't know which character he is in Walking Dead because I didn't get to watch that show
884000	886000	because my wife didn't want to watch The Walking Dead.
886000	889000	She didn't want to watch, you know, Breaking Bad.
889000	891000	She wanted to watch House again.
891000	894000	My mother watches Walking Dead.
894000	895000	She wants me to watch it.
895000	897000	Or Grey's Anatomy again.
897000	900000	Or God whatever other awful show.
900000	901000	Here's the thing.
901000	904000	I don't watch it because A, it's on on Sunday nights and there's-
904000	906000	B, Netflix exists.
906000	907000	Yeah, something else going on.
907000	910000	It's too violent for me is my honest answer.
910000	912000	You guys know how I feel about the gore of violent stuff.
913000	916000	Like when it's cartoony video game Mortal Kombat 2.
916000	918000	It's funny and I can deal with it.
918000	920000	Or like the Happy Tree Friends and stuff.
920000	922000	Even that's a bit much sometimes.
922000	924000	That should be a crossover character for Mortal Kombat.
924000	925000	I can deal with it.
925000	929000	But like the new Mortal Kombats that are like super realistic.
929000	930000	I'm like this is-
930000	931000	Oh my God.
931000	937000	Now I really want a Happy Tree Friends fighting game in the style of the latest Mortal Kombat game where it's just ultra violent.
937000	939000	Wasn't there a Happy Tree Friends game years ago?
939000	940000	I thought there was.
940000	941000	I could be wrong.
941000	942000	That was years ago.
942000	944000	Anyway, I don't even think that's a thing anymore.
944000	947000	Anyway, other news out of EVO.
947000	951000	Let's see, DLC character Terry Bogard for fighting EX.
951000	954000	Which is going to be a character in there.
954000	957000	Aria and Sharon teased.
957000	962000	Volcano Rosso and Pullum Perna are coming out between August and September.
962000	964000	I know none of these characters unfortunately.
964000	966000	I don't follow this series at all.
967000	972000	I probably should because I've always had a soft spot for like the stuff that came from SNK and Neo Geo back in the day.
972000	974000	And obviously that's where that all comes from.
974000	975000	Soul Calibur 6.
975000	977000	Now this is more my speed.
977000	978000	I love the Soul Calibur series.
978000	982000	Astaroth and Song Minah are announced that are going to be in the game.
982000	985000	Why don't they just say all the old characters are coming back?
985000	987000	Because I feel like every week we have an announcement.
987000	989000	How many games has Maxie died in?
989000	990000	Probably all of them.
990000	993000	But the soul is eternal.
993000	997000	He still has the voice actor he had in the original Soul Calibur 2.
997000	999000	Anyway, I'm super excited about Soul Calibur 6.
999000	1000000	I'll be checking that out for sure.
1000000	1003000	There is a new Guilty Gear game being made.
1003000	1005000	That is something that was announced as well.
1005000	1011000	DOA 6 teased some reveals that are coming up for Gamescom.
1011000	1013000	But unfortunately they did not announce anything.
1013000	1016000	There is thought that during the show later tonight.
1016000	1018000	So maybe we'll have some breaking news in part B.
1018000	1021000	Capcom may tease some Street Fighter 5 stuff.
1021000	1023000	But that would not happen until the top 8.
1023000	1025000	That is I believe what is happening at EVO right now.
1025000	1027000	Is the Street Fighter 5 stuff.
1027000	1030000	So we may hear about that mid-show at some point.
1030000	1032000	So that would be cool.
1032000	1036000	Okay, so I did recognize him from Grey's Anatomy unfortunately.
1036000	1038000	One of those shows your wife made you one.
1038000	1039000	I was like...
1039000	1041000	But he does look very much like...
1041000	1043000	There is a comedian that looks kind of like him too.
1043000	1045000	That was the brother in...
1045000	1047000	Everybody Loves Raymond.
1047000	1049000	Yeah.
1049000	1050000	No worries.
1050000	1052000	There is an update for Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Edition.
1052000	1054000	That has just hit the Switch.
1054000	1057000	And if you want to play Dragon Ball FighterZ on Switch.
1057000	1059000	The open beta is next week.
1059000	1064000	And SNK Heroines is going to feature a female Terry Bogard.
1064000	1066000	Which is pretty cool.
1066000	1068000	So kind of like some gender swapping there.
1068000	1070000	But you know we've kind of seen that in some other games before.
1070000	1071000	So that will be...
1071000	1073000	Yes and he is much hotter as a female.
1073000	1075000	It depends on what you're into.
1075000	1076000	But sure.
1076000	1077000	Alright.
1077000	1078000	So anyway.
1078000	1081000	Lots of talk about fighting games this weekend because of EVO.
1081000	1084000	What was the last fighting game you got into?
1084000	1085000	Loki?
1085000	1087000	You don't really play a lot of fighting games do you?
1087000	1089000	Last fighting game I played? Jeez.
1089000	1090000	What about you guys in chat?
1090000	1093000	What was the last fighting game you super got into?
1093000	1095000	I don't know.
1095000	1098000	I'd probably say on my arcade cabinet I was playing Marvel vs. Capcom 2.
1098000	1102000	I mean I didn't really get into like any fighting games like a lot.
1102000	1105000	Yeah that was probably the last one.
1105000	1106000	I mean.
1106000	1108000	I may have played.
1108000	1110000	No I don't know if I played Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
1110000	1112000	I did want that one though.
1112000	1115000	You know what I wish they would release like on Switch.
1115000	1117000	Or one of these like collection type of things.
1117000	1118000	Maybe it's been out.
1118000	1120000	Or Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
1120000	1121000	I did play that on the Wii.
1121000	1122000	Did you?
1122000	1123000	Yeah that game was pretty cool.
1123000	1126000	I want them to bring back Capcom vs. SNK 2.
1126000	1128000	And I imagine it's like a licensing nightmare.
1128000	1129000	Which is why that won't happen.
1129000	1131000	But that's like one of my all time favorite fighting games.
1131000	1133000	But I feel like that's a game I want on Switch.
1133000	1135000	That I'll probably be waiting forever.
1135000	1136000	For something like that.
1136000	1138000	But that's like one of my all time favorite fighting games.
1138000	1140000	Is Capcom SNK 2.
1140000	1141000	So.
1141000	1142000	Yeah that was pretty good.
1142000	1143000	And then let's see.
1143000	1145000	I get into the Soul Calibur series.
1145000	1146000	So I'll be excited with Soul Calibur 6.
1146000	1149000	Or I did try to get into Mugen a little bit.
1149000	1150000	But.
1150000	1151000	Oh yeah that was the thing you were.
1151000	1152000	That was like betting wasn't it?
1152000	1153000	Well salty bet.
1153000	1154000	Yeah that was fun.
1154000	1155000	But no actually.
1155000	1157000	The problem with Mugen is like.
1157000	1158000	Balancing.
1158000	1161000	I mean I guess you just don't give a shit about balance.
1161000	1162000	It's just like.
1163000	1165000	Throw everybody in there and balance.
1165000	1166000	Whatever.
1166000	1169000	There's no fucking way this is ever going to be balanced.
1169000	1171000	But I kind of wanted to get into that.
1171000	1172000	But more.
1172000	1173000	You know actually balance it out.
1173000	1174000	But yeah it's just.
1174000	1175000	It's just too much.
1175000	1178000	It's too overwhelming when you see all the options.
1178000	1180000	It's like I don't know who to put in my roster.
1180000	1181000	It's too many.
1181000	1183000	Too many people.
1183000	1184000	It's like.
1184000	1185000	I'll put all the fighting.
1185000	1186000	All of them.
1186000	1187000	All of the characters.
1187000	1188000	Every single one of them.
1188000	1191000	Probably the last fighting game I probably played like more than a couple hours of.
1191000	1193000	Like recently was actually Street Fighter 4.
1193000	1195000	Like that game kind of still delivers.
1195000	1196000	Because it's.
1196000	1197000	It's everywhere.
1197000	1199000	Like remember Street Fighter 4 was a launch title on the 3DS.
1199000	1200000	Remember that.
1200000	1201000	I have it on my cabinet.
1201000	1202000	Yeah.
1202000	1203000	But then obviously you know it keeps.
1203000	1206000	They put it out on PlayStation Plus or something not that long ago.
1206000	1207000	One of those.
1207000	1208000	The Xbox Gold or something.
1208000	1209000	So and then it's you know.
1209000	1212000	It's very easy to find a copy of Street Fighter 4.
1212000	1213000	And that is a very solid fighter.
1213000	1214000	So I would say that's what it is.
1214000	1216000	I didn't put that on the Switch.
1217000	1219000	Yeah that is kind of surprising that doesn't exist on Switch.
1219000	1225000	Maybe they have like some exclusive deal right now with console exclusives for Street Fighter as a whole franchise.
1225000	1229000	Well no because that Switch just got that massive collection that we just mentioned.
1229000	1232000	With the Street Fighter 3 and the alpha and you know that whole bundle.
1232000	1233000	Yeah.
1233000	1234000	About 4.
1234000	1237000	Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1237000	1240000	SJ100Matt is talking about FighterZ.
1240000	1242000	It was a game he got into recently.
1242000	1244000	I played online and stopped playing.
1244000	1246000	People are just insanely tough on there.
1246000	1250000	Bonds006 says I played me some Marvel vs. Capcom 2 before I came home.
1250000	1254000	But SJ100Matt points out Capcom vs. SNK 2 is also up there.
1254000	1258000	Jamie I didn't really get your opinion on this.
1258000	1261000	What's like a fighting game series you've recently been into.
1261000	1265000	Like a fighting game series you like follow, watch or that you've played a lot of.
1267000	1273000	Because I feel like you probably have collectively played more fighting games than the two of us.
1273000	1274000	Just with your history.
1274000	1279000	I was really into Tekken for a long time when I started working at that Amco arcade.
1279000	1280000	Tekken 3 was my jam.
1280000	1282000	Tekken 4 I was really into.
1282000	1283000	Tekken 5 I was really into.
1283000	1285000	Tekken Tag not so much.
1287000	1290000	Yeah Tekken was really the big one for me for a while.
1290000	1295000	And then I was also really into like Darkstalkers.
1295000	1296000	Oh sure.
1296000	1298000	Yeah really into Darkstalkers.
1298000	1302000	You know that makes me think of Puzzle Fighter.
1302000	1306000	And even though I guess Puzzle Fighter is something that is represented at EVO.
1306000	1310000	EVO is not just like the big fighting games that everybody knows.
1310000	1314000	But I guess EVO has a lot of tournaments for a lot of little stuff too.
1314000	1317000	Like I guess they have the Windjammers because that recently came back right.
1317000	1318000	So they have a Windjammers tournament there.
1318000	1321000	But they have a Puzzle Fighter tournament that happens at EVO.
1321000	1323000	And that is more up my alley.
1323000	1325000	Like Puzzle Fighter that's a fun game.
1325000	1327000	Is that Pocket Fighter?
1328000	1331000	I'm sure they do but I don't know.
1331000	1333000	I wish Puzzle Fighter would come back.
1333000	1337000	And yes I'm well aware of the iPhone Android game.
1337000	1338000	So I'm going to go back to what I said.
1338000	1340000	I wish Puzzle Fighter would come back.
1341000	1343000	I wish that they would do.
1345000	1350000	Would bring Red Earth out which I knew that that ship has sailed because that should have been Saturn era.
1350000	1352000	But I'd like to see like a sequel to Red Earth.
1352000	1354000	I thought you want Arrival Schools.
1354000	1355000	I really want Arrival Schools.
1355000	1356000	That was my other jam.
1356000	1357000	Yeah.
1358000	1363000	I even posted on my Twitter the other day that I still want Arrival Schools game.
1364000	1365000	You know those are my big things.
1365000	1370000	And you know Dan and I played a lot of X-Men vs Street Fighter because we had it on Saturn.
1370000	1371000	Nice.
1371000	1373000	And then Marvel Super Heroes vs Street Fighter we had that.
1373000	1378000	Is there anything like recent like some of the recent batches that you've gotten into or do you kind of nothing beats the 2D classics?
1378000	1380000	I finally got to play Dragon Ball FighterZ.
1380000	1381000	Oh what did you think?
1381000	1382000	I really liked it.
1382000	1384000	It was a little difficult to get used to the moves.
1384000	1390000	And we're actually even though I have it on Steam I'm going to get the one of the console releases.
1390000	1392000	I just have to figure out which one we want to get.
1393000	1396000	If I get it on Switch I'll have to get another pro controller I guess.
1396000	1398000	It was really a lot of fun.
1398000	1399000	Yeah.
1399000	1408000	And but I really think that my big fighting game enthusiasm kind of died out after Marvel vs Capcom 2.
1408000	1414000	Well you know I honestly like the Dreamcast was like the fighting game console for me.
1414000	1418000	That was like all the best 2D fighting games were on the freaking Dreamcast.
1418000	1424000	And I didn't even I didn't even buy Dreamcast until like Sega had already canned it and they were down to like forty dollars.
1424000	1427000	But then it's like I went back and rediscovered all these amazing games.
1427000	1431000	And even not just the 2D stuff but that's where like Soul Edge was a Dreamcast thing right.
1431000	1433000	So you know like.
1433000	1436000	So like Vons006 says Darkstalkers is the new Half Life.
1436000	1439000	And I was like except there was a third Darkstalkers.
1439000	1441000	Darkstalkers did get to three yes.
1441000	1443000	We have Vampire Savior.
1443000	1445000	All right.
1445000	1449000	All right well fighting games is fun but I know we play a lot more than just fighting games.
1449000	1452000	And let's talk about the other games that we have been playing in your gaming week.
1452000	1454000	So Darkstalker how was your gaming week?
1454000	1456000	It was pretty dead.
1456000	1458000	I've had a really busy week because I'm in training at work.
1459000	1465000	So I don't know I read the WoW wiki and I read the Injustice 2 wiki.
1465000	1469000	To the point that I think Dan and I might have to pick up Injustice speaking of fighting games.
1469000	1471000	Except I hate DC.
1471000	1475000	Like none of the characters really interest me but that game really interests me.
1475000	1480000	Injustice is pretty like the cool thing about Injustice is that it's Mortal Kombat basically.
1480000	1483000	But it's not that violent stuff that I was talking about.
1483000	1485000	It's instead it's superheroes.
1485000	1487000	And it has a story.
1487000	1490000	You know I understand there's a DC versus Marvel thing.
1490000	1493000	I don't get as into that argument and I love Batman.
1493000	1497000	So you know there's always going to be some of the stuff in DC that I'm like into.
1497000	1499000	It's like a new Marvel fighting game.
1499000	1501000	I think Injustice is a solid franchise.
1501000	1506000	Yeah it doesn't matter how you feel about comic books and stuff.
1506000	1508000	Like a good game is still a good game.
1508000	1510000	I like all the character interactions though.
1510000	1515000	And also that game has my favorite ever version of Harley Quinn.
1515000	1517000	Because she's still herself but she's moved on.
1517000	1519000	Yeah.
1519000	1525000	And really I mean it's just been a lot of pinball lately because we just got the shadow.
1525000	1529000	And I've been perusing a few things on Steam.
1529000	1532000	But I haven't really played anything yet.
1532000	1535000	I need to get my stream setup done.
1535000	1540000	I was trying to say I need to get my streaming stuff set up.
1540000	1545000	So I've been slacking.
1545000	1547000	It's been a busy week.
1547000	1548000	Sure. It happens.
1548000	1550000	All right. Loki how about you? How was your gaming week?
1550000	1553000	I didn't play a whole lot of games because I've been working on programming.
1553000	1555000	So I did play.
1555000	1562000	Well my son's birthday was this week so we bought him a gaming laptop for his birthday.
1562000	1564000	Probably a big mistake but whatever.
1564000	1568000	So he has been playing games on there so I did while setting it up.
1568000	1571000	Check it out because I haven't played it surprisingly enough.
1571000	1573000	Octodad.
1573000	1574000	Oh yeah.
1574000	1575000	That game is hilarious.
1575000	1577000	So we got to play a little bit of that.
1577000	1581000	But it's basically setting up Minecraft and stuff for him with mods and everything.
1581000	1588000	Man Minecraft and mods have really come before I remember trying to get controller support in Minecraft.
1588000	1589000	It was a pain in the ass.
1589000	1591000	Now they just have a mod that works with them.
1591000	1594000	Like jeez this is fucking easier than it was when I had to do this.
1594000	1597000	So that's kind of cool.
1597000	1603000	But really didn't play a whole lot other than Pokemon Go this week just because I can't get access to my TV.
1603000	1608000	My brand new 4K TV and my PlayStation Pro.
1608000	1615000	And my brand new copy of Horizon Zero Dawn that's literally had two minutes worth of playtime on it.
1615000	1617000	So sad.
1617000	1621000	So I haven't been playing any console games unfortunately.
1621000	1625000	I did install more Steam games because why not?
1625000	1628000	Let's make that library bigger of stuff I'm never going to play.
1628000	1632000	But I had a bunch of stuff like I was digging through my Humble Bundle library.
1632000	1634000	Because I was like well I need to get some keys to my son.
1634000	1636000	Because I gave him a Steam account.
1636000	1642000	And I was like okay well I'm just going to offload all these duplicate keys that I have.
1642000	1644000	Which I have like 50 duplicate keys.
1644000	1646000	It's fucking ridiculous.
1646000	1648000	So I was going through that and I'm like wait a second.
1648000	1649000	This is stuff I haven't read.
1649000	1652000	I remember purchasing this and I didn't ever redeem it.
1653000	1658000	So I've been going through that and just adding this to my library since I'm like up to like 560.
1660000	1663000	Maybe I'll play a game. I'll pick a game to play and just play through it.
1663000	1664000	You should do that.
1664000	1665000	Especially when you're on a video gaming podcast.
1665000	1667000	Playing some games is good.
1667000	1668000	But whatever.
1668000	1671000	You know what? My motivation was I need to finish a fucking game.
1671000	1674000	So everybody can stop saying fake the fucking game.
1674000	1677000	I was going to, if you would let me finish my sentence before you.
1678000	1683000	I was going to say but I know you've been spending a lot of time trying to get back into Unity to write games.
1683000	1686000	Well I'm in. I've kind of left Unity. I'm back in Unreal now.
1686000	1688000	Oh sorry. But still.
1688000	1692000	You're working on the thing that everybody criticizes you about.
1692000	1697000	So I suppose you could be given some credit there.
1697000	1699000	But play some more games.
1699000	1700000	I want to play more games.
1700000	1701000	Alright.
1701000	1702000	Anyway.
1702000	1703000	Let's see my gaming week.
1704000	1706000	To be fair. I haven't played a lot of new games.
1706000	1709000	Because the game I've been still playing most of this week.
1709000	1711000	No Man's Sky with the reboot.
1711000	1713000	That's exactly it. I want to go back to that too.
1713000	1717000	Yeah. And honestly. I probably streamed that game like three times this week.
1717000	1721000	And been continuing my adventures in No Man's Sky.
1721000	1723000	Learned a lot about multiplayer.
1723000	1726000	With how the weird syncing works.
1726000	1728000	Because I don't think it does server syncing.
1728000	1729000	I think it's like peer to peer.
1729000	1732000	Because the only way I was able to see Bobby's base finally.
1732000	1735000	Which he built on the same planet that I built my base.
1735000	1737000	He just built it like across the river.
1737000	1739000	Is that the only way we could do that.
1739000	1741000	Is that he started a game.
1741000	1743000	I joined his game.
1743000	1744000	We met on the planet.
1744000	1746000	And then I could see the base.
1746000	1747000	And then it stayed.
1747000	1749000	And actually. Bobby doesn't know this part.
1749000	1751000	It did stay behind.
1751000	1753000	So that when I played off stream.
1753000	1754000	And I went back to his base.
1754000	1757000	I got the trophy for visiting a base.
1757000	1758000	Basically alone.
1758000	1760000	It's weird though that you would think that we would just update.
1760000	1762000	It's just like it hasn't refreshed.
1762000	1765000	Yeah. But there's no server talk or something.
1765000	1767000	But there should be. All that's supposed to be persistent.
1767000	1768000	Well. Here's the thing.
1768000	1772000	I think maybe the game is very popular right now with the reboot.
1772000	1773000	And I think a lot of that's struggling.
1773000	1774000	Because I notice.
1774000	1776000	Like every time I play the game.
1776000	1778000	The little icon for naming services.
1778000	1780000	Always is like naming services are offline.
1780000	1782000	Like it's always offline.
1782000	1784000	So I think the things that I'm naming.
1784000	1785000	Don't get out there.
1785000	1787000	I didn't want to name this shitty planet anyway.
1787000	1788000	Exactly.
1788000	1790000	Well the funny thing that happened on one stream.
1790000	1792000	And there's a clip of it over my Twitch channel.
1792000	1793000	Rob Roberts.
1793000	1796000	The funny thing that happened on a stream that really made me lose my shit.
1796000	1800000	There was a planet that was like really icy and frozen.
1800000	1802000	And so I was just joking like.
1802000	1804000	Oh well I'm going to name this planet Madonna.
1804000	1805000	Because it's frozen.
1805000	1807000	Because it's heart's not open. Get it?
1807000	1809000	So I tried to name the planet Madonna.
1809000	1811000	And as soon as I hit enter for Madonna.
1811000	1812000	It came up.
1812000	1813000	Profanity filter.
1813000	1815000	This name has been rejected by the profanity filter.
1815000	1817000	Madonna is a profane word.
1817000	1818000	I can't.
1818000	1819000	I can't name the planet.
1819000	1820000	I'm like who made this game?
1820000	1821000	Lady Gaga?
1821000	1822000	Like what is.
1822000	1824000	Why can't I name a planet Madonna?
1824000	1825000	So I had to name it.
1825000	1827000	The second rate Madonna.
1827000	1828000	Venus Delight.
1828000	1830000	Which like two listeners will understand that joke.
1830000	1831000	So anyway.
1831000	1833000	It wouldn't take Madonna.
1833000	1835000	Now I wonder if it's because Madonna.
1835000	1836000	I mean to be fair.
1836000	1838000	Does have biblical connotations to it.
1838000	1839000	But still.
1839000	1840000	I just found that very weird.
1840000	1841000	That it was in the.
1841000	1843000	It could be something like that.
1843000	1844000	Or it could be a phonetic filter.
1844000	1845000	It could be like you know maybe.
1845000	1847000	Is Madonna a curse word in another language?
1847000	1848000	Maybe there's like.
1848000	1849000	I don't know.
1849000	1850000	Eh.
1850000	1851000	Go to Madonna.
1851000	1852000	Is that a.
1852000	1853000	I don't know.
1853000	1854000	Curse in another language.
1854000	1855000	I don't know.
1855000	1856000	Anyway.
1856000	1857000	Tiger Claw says.
1857000	1863000	Maybe the game is preventing you to name planets as celebrities.
1863000	1865000	It isn't doing a very good job because I have.
1865000	1866000	Let's see.
1866000	1867000	I have.
1867000	1869000	I have planetary systems named Aisha Tyler.
1869000	1870000	Beth Ditto.
1870000	1872000	We stan Robin.
1872000	1873000	I.
1873000	1874000	There's plenty of.
1874000	1876000	I have a planet named Vangie.
1876000	1880000	I'm sure there's probably like 5,000 planets named Miss Vangie or Vangie or some connotation
1880000	1881000	of.
1881000	1884000	But you better believe I have a planet named Vangie out there.
1884000	1886000	So I mean you could name things after celebrities.
1886000	1889000	Madonna is the first one where it said nope.
1889000	1891000	Oh I don't know.
1891000	1894000	Bobby Blackwolf trying to give some insight to what's going on saying.
1894000	1896000	It's persistent to new players.
1896000	1899000	But once you've already visited a planet.
1899000	1901000	It doesn't try to get new information.
1901000	1902000	Hmm.
1902000	1903000	Interesting.
1903000	1906000	So it's like it downloads the planet the first time you go.
1906000	1908000	But then once you kind of like have your own version of it.
1908000	1910000	It doesn't keep trying to grab it from the server.
1910000	1915000	Which might be part of how they try to reduce strain on the server since we're not exactly
1915000	1916000	playing.
1916000	1918000	Or paying a monthly fee to.
1918000	1920000	To play the game online or anything.
1920000	1921000	But I don't know.
1921000	1922000	Yeah whatever.
1922000	1923000	Yeah.
1923000	1924000	I mean it's not.
1924000	1926000	It's not deal breaking for me because.
1926000	1930000	I kind of feel that multiplayer is sort of limited anyway.
1930000	1934000	Like the night that Bobby and I were kind of screwing around on stream and Dungeon Buster
1934000	1935000	was there too.
1935000	1938000	And we were like looking at stuff on the planet like that was fun.
1938000	1940000	But I don't think you could really play the whole game that way.
1940000	1942000	Like I'm not sure that would really work.
1942000	1945000	Like now we're at a point where like Bobby's kind of at one point in the story.
1945000	1946000	I'm at one point in the story.
1946000	1949000	And it's cool that we have this place to converge.
1949000	1954000	And that's what I like is that oh we have this world where we both have bases so we
1954000	1955000	can kind of you know.
1955000	1959000	But I actually I used Bobby's base to hide from Sentinels.
1959000	1964000	Because just on the other side of the hill from Bobby there was some stuff I was mining.
1964000	1965000	Some hydrogen crystals or something.
1965000	1970000	And I actually mined so much of it because I have a new multi-tool that does it fast.
1970000	1973000	So I mined so much of it that it pissed off the Sentinel.
1973000	1974000	And I was like oh crap.
1974000	1975000	And so it's like follow me follow me.
1975000	1977000	So I ran into Bobby's base and it finally.
1977000	1980000	The worst fucking part of that game is the stupid fucking Sentinels.
1980000	1981000	I hate that shit.
1981000	1982000	Yeah.
1982000	1983000	Well you can kill them.
1983000	1984000	But it just.
1984000	1985000	It'll rate.
1985000	1986000	Yeah but then it lets.
1986000	1987000	You know.
1987000	1988000	But there's a lot of quests.
1988000	1991300	Clean up until you get like super death Sentinels or whatever.
1991300	1994000	There's a lot of quests that.
1994000	1997000	I want you to kill Sentinels.
1997000	2001000	Bobby Blackwell says someone on Reddit tried to name planet Madonna a year ago.
2001000	2005600	Well I'm sure I'm sure I'm not the first person in history to try to name something Madonna
2005600	2010840	no man's sky like you know there's other 40 year old gay guys that play this game I'm
2010840	2011840	sure.
2011840	2017000	But still like it's just it's the first time I heard of it.
2018000	2021000	I'm doing something that has nothing to do with video games tomorrow.
2021000	2024000	Uh dare I ask what is it worthy of mentioning on this show or.
2024000	2029000	Yeah I'm going to see Sailor Moon Super subtitled in the theater tomorrow night.
2029000	2030000	Huh.
2030000	2031000	That's awesome.
2031000	2034000	I still haven't seen the Mamma Mia sequel I'm upset.
2034000	2036000	And Transformers the movie is going to be playing.
2036000	2040000	I my wife saw the sequel she said it wasn't that great.
2040000	2045000	I don't always agree with your wife though no no no offense but I don't always agree
2045000	2049000	with her opinion on movies and TV and stuff so I'm going to see it anyway.
2049000	2052000	It doesn't matter like you literally have 20 people tell me it's fucking garbage.
2052000	2057000	She and I'm still going to go see she watched that movie room on Netflix yesterday.
2057000	2061000	Not the room but room totally different right.
2061000	2063000	No the one that got nominated for Oscar.
2063000	2067000	Yes I don't know.
2067000	2069000	Anyway so that was no man's sky.
2069000	2073000	And then otherwise I've also been continue to play Pokemon Go.
2073000	2078000	I'm two thirds of the way through level 38 now so I have six million XP to go before
2078000	2080000	I'm capped in Pokemon Go.
2080000	2085000	So the friends thing has been great for XP even though I'm really bad at sending you
2085000	2090000	receiving gifts when I do do it and I've really been trying to get my gifts out there when
2090000	2094000	I do do it like I've been I've been hitting 10000 XP bonuses like left and right because
2094000	2097000	I'm getting up to two stars with people and now I'm starting to hit three stars with some
2097000	2100000	people like I hit three stars with you this week Loki right.
2100000	2101000	Yeah that was actually right after the show.
2101000	2107000	That was 50000 XP dark soccer and I are like we were probably going to hit it today like
2107000	2111000	that that it's hard to tell because it doesn't give you a numerical representation of how
2111000	2112000	far along you are.
2112000	2113000	Yes you can.
2113000	2114000	Oh how.
2114000	2117000	So go into your friends thing.
2117000	2118000	I'm doing this right now.
2118000	2123000	So go into your friends and then go to whatever friend you want to look at.
2123000	2124000	OK.
2124000	2125000	Well I got to launch my game.
2125000	2126000	You keep talking.
2126000	2127000	I'll do this.
2127000	2132000	Go whatever friend you look at you tap on the icon that shows the little circles and
2132000	2136000	I'll tell you how many days away you are from reaching your next level.
2136000	2137000	I had no idea.
2137000	2140000	Well that makes it easier to know when to pop the stupid lucky egg.
2140000	2141000	So let me go.
2141000	2146000	So when I go to my friends list and I'm scrolling right now to find dark soccer.
2146000	2148000	So she's down here.
2148000	2149000	There she is.
2149000	2150000	So I.
2150000	2151000	Oh OK.
2151000	2153000	So you tap on the.
2153000	2156000	Oh play together for two more days to become ultra friends.
2156000	2158000	So we won't hit it today.
2158000	2159000	We'll hit it tomorrow.
2159000	2160000	Yeah.
2160000	2163000	Assuming I remember to open her gift after the show that I will.
2163000	2165000	So that's how you know.
2165000	2166000	OK.
2166000	2167000	Good to know.
2167000	2168000	Good to know.
2168000	2169000	So where am I.
2169000	2172000	So there's one person above dark soccer that I'm almost.
2172000	2175000	This is one of these guys that I played those online survivor games with.
2175000	2178000	So he is at one more day.
2178000	2181000	So I will hit three stars with somebody today.
2181000	2182000	So there is that.
2182000	2183000	That's cool.
2183000	2185000	How long do Loki and I have to go before we hit four stars.
2185000	2189000	It looks well I have magma lemur who is kind of the furthest along.
2189000	2191000	He has 53 more days.
2191000	2193000	So I have to accept your gift.
2193000	2196000	So you and I have 56 more days to be BFF.
2196000	2197000	Yes.
2197000	2202000	My strongest whatever you want to call it friend in the game is one of my friends in Toronto.
2202000	2204000	Forty six more days.
2204000	2209000	So but we have Kyle and I have traded every single day.
2209000	2211000	Like we have not missed a beat every single day.
2211000	2218000	He's the first person I send a gift to every day just because he was the most regular at everybody.
2218000	2220000	So we ended up being like the closest friends.
2220000	2222000	So that's Pokemon Go.
2222000	2223000	Kuma JP.
2223000	2224000	So we're talking about there.
2224000	2225000	All right.
2225000	2227000	But but some of you some of the listeners are close.
2227000	2229000	Act Deft is number two on my list.
2229000	2234000	And I think as 200 miles like number four behind one of my local friends.
2234000	2238000	So as 200 Matt and Act after still above Shane on my list.
2238000	2240000	Shane's at number like six or seven on my list.
2240000	2242000	So anyway Pokemon Go.
2242000	2244000	Good times.
2244000	2247000	Let's get into some other stuff.
2247000	2250000	I want to get into some like housekeeping and announcements sort of thing.
2250000	2252000	I do have like a personal announcement.
2252000	2256000	So I changed my Twitter name after God I've been on Twitter.
2256000	2258000	When did Twitter start like 2006.
2258000	2260000	I've probably been on Twitter since 2006.
2260000	2264000	And some of you told me not to give up my four letter name.
2264000	2265000	But I did it.
2265000	2267000	I switched my name on Twitter to Mr. Rob Roberts.
2267000	2269000	So if you want to follow me on Twitter I'm at Mr. Rob Roberts.
2270000	2273000	I just didn't feel as strong of a connection to the old name anymore.
2273000	2276000	Which I haven't really used regularly since the DDR days.
2276000	2279000	When I would enter in my high score with a four letter name.
2279000	2283000	I think due to this show and other podcasts and things I've done.
2283000	2285000	Was that either friend you again or did you change?
2285000	2289000	No because the good news about Twitter is that it just carries it all with you.
2289000	2290000	So I didn't lose anybody.
2290000	2291000	No I wouldn't.
2291000	2292000	Oh my God.
2292000	2295000	With being on the site that long I would not want to build up from scratch again.
2295000	2296000	No way.
2296000	2298000	So I did it because everything carries with you.
2298000	2299000	But here's the interesting thing.
2299000	2303000	I tried to snag the old name right back.
2303000	2305000	And I had two browsers waiting to go.
2305000	2307000	So I made the change on the first browser.
2307000	2311000	And then in the second browser I had a new account ready to go to switch to Sky, my old name.
2311000	2313000	I couldn't do it.
2313000	2317000	Because it says you cannot have a Twitter name with less than five characters.
2317000	2320000	So Twitter no longer lets you have short usernames.
2320000	2324000	So at least the good news is nobody can have my old name.
2324000	2332000	But the kind of crappy part is that I can't put a placeholder for all those old streams and old episodes of the show where I shouted out my old name.
2332000	2333000	It's not going to work.
2333000	2334000	So that part kind of sucks.
2334000	2336000	But I'm trying to look forward not backward.
2336000	2340000	So at least my Instagram and my Twitter are unified now.
2340000	2344000	And so like Snapchat and all that other crap I'll probably try to unify.
2344000	2345000	So I have all that one name.
2345000	2348000	So that'll be that'll be nice.
2348000	2349000	So there it is.
2349000	2350000	So that's my new Twitter name.
2350000	2353000	Also I want to quickly talk about Dragon Con.
2353000	2357000	So we're not going to be here at the end of the month over Labor Day weekend because I'm going to be at Dragon Con.
2357000	2364000	And I guess I can talk about this now because a lot of the panel schedules or at least, you know, everything is tentative until the show shows up.
2364000	2367000	But all the tentative stuff is now out there.
2367000	2370000	I'm going to be doing eight panels this year at Dragon Con.
2370000	2372000	And I am really excited about it.
2372000	2374000	That's a lot of panels.
2374000	2377000	But I love doing panels.
2377000	2386000	And part of the reason why I'm doing more panels at Dragon Con this year than years past is that not only is the Dragon Con podcasting track having me back, which I'm very thankful for.
2386000	2388000	And I'm doing some pretty cool stuff with them.
2388000	2392000	But also I will be working for the first time with the Dragon Con video gaming track.
2392000	2398000	So if you've never been a video, excuse me, if you've never been to Dragon Con, it's like 20 conventions all happening at once.
2398000	2401000	They have all these different tracks that have full time programming.
2401000	2411000	And there's tracks for Star Trek, Star Wars, Whedonverse, British television because British, or Powell from British Invaders, Brian is almost always doing stuff with that track.
2411000	2419000	Gary from Critical Myth will probably be doing stuff with either the Trek track or the X track, which is some of like the sci-fi modern programming stuff.
2419000	2422000	Like I went to a Twin Peaks panel on the X track last year.
2422000	2426000	So, I mean, there's all sorts of like stuff that all happens at once.
2426000	2430000	So I'm working with two tracks this year, whereas every other year I've been to Dragon Con, I've been working with one.
2430000	2432000	So I'm very happy.
2432000	2439000	Bobby, I really would not have been able to do it without Bobby finally getting in touch with the gaming track and kind of pushing us to get on there.
2439000	2441000	So I'm really excited about it.
2441000	2444000	So let me tell you some of the panels I'm going to be doing.
2444000	2446000	I'm going to run through this fast because there's a lot.
2446000	2450000	So Friday at 10 a.m., I'm going to be doing a Mass Effect voice actors panel.
2450000	2452000	Oh my gosh, I'm so thrilled about this one.
2452000	2458000	Like obviously, you know, I'm a professional, but at the same time, I'm going to fanboy a little bit about Mass Effect.
2458000	2466000	So this Mass Effect voice actors panel, Mark Muir, who's the male voice of Shepard, the voice of Jack, the voice of Legion, all going to be on this panel.
2466000	2468000	I'm really excited about that one.
2468000	2474000	7 p.m. Eastern on Friday, over with the podcasting track, going to be doing a panel on live broadcasting.
2474000	2477000	I only have my short notes for my personal calendar here that I'm looking at.
2477000	2485000	I'll give you the longer descriptions once the app is out because I would encourage you to download the Dragon Con app if you're going to Dragon Con because it's amazing.
2485000	2491000	But there's a live broadcasting panel that I'm going to be part of, which, you know, I've been doing live broadcasting thanks to OLR for a little while.
2491000	2493000	So we'll have a lot to say there.
2493000	2496000	Also doing a podcast panel at 10 o'clock on Friday night.
2496000	2501000	It is a like Shark Tank style panel for podcasters.
2501000	2504000	It's like a pitch your podcast type of thing and we'll give you immediate feedback.
2504000	2512000	So I get to be the, what's his name, the guy that owns the basketball team, Mark Cuban.
2512000	2514000	I get to be the Mark Cuban of that panel.
2514000	2517000	Actually, I don't know if I'll be the mean one. I don't know. We'll see.
2517000	2522000	I'm really, but when it comes to podcasting, I'm very hippy dippy and like everybody should do it.
2522000	2525000	Everybody should be a podcaster. So maybe I won't be the Mark Cuban.
2525000	2528000	Saturday is going to be very busy for me, but I'm very excited.
2528000	2530000	1 o'clock Eastern over the Westin.
2530000	2538000	I'm going to be doing a Five Nights at Freddy's sister location live playthrough with voice actors from the game.
2538000	2540000	Sorry, I'm not the one playing the game.
2540000	2546000	Because that would have been a recipe for disaster, but that's going to be really fun.
2546000	2556000	Right after that is done, I have to run back over to the hotel where the podcast panel is doing a broadcasting and podcasting type of thing,
2556000	2559000	which I believe, again, I only have my short notes here.
2559000	2565000	I believe that is a panel about some like the streaming and doing like, you know, again, kind of like live performance stuff.
2565000	2570000	4 o'clock Eastern back at the Westin. So I'm literally running back and forth that day.
2570000	2575000	There's a Twitch 101 panel. So they're going to have an engineer from Twitch that's actually going to be there.
2575000	2580000	And I will be moderating kind of like a, how do you do Twitch? Why should you do Twitch?
2580000	2582000	You know, kind of all about Twitch, like a Twitch discussion.
2582000	2587000	That'll probably be also a great networking panel because I imagine a lot of Twitch streamers,
2587000	2591000	probably small up and comers that go to Dragon Con will probably be there wanting to network.
2591000	2594000	So I'll be right there networking with you all.
2594000	2600000	And then back on the podcasting track at 7 o'clock Saturday night, a panel on social media.
2600000	2605000	So getting on Twitter, Instagram, all the new stuff. There's stuff I haven't even heard of.
2605000	2610000	I learned about an app called Anchor, which is really big for podcasters, thanks to a panel like this last year.
2610000	2614000	So that will be a lot of fun. So that is on Saturday.
2614000	2621000	And then I'm not done yet. Sunday at 4 o'clock Eastern, I'm going to be doing an Overwatch voice actors panel.
2621000	2629000	I am really excited about this and so thankful to the gaming track staff for letting me, trusting me with this.
2629000	2634000	So the voice actresses behind Mercy, D.Va, and Symmetra will be there.
2634000	2640000	And it's going to take everything in my power to not ask the question, how does it feel to be gay icons, all of you?
2640000	2647000	Because honestly, I know a lot of gay Overwatch players and they all play D.Va, Mercy, and Symmetra.
2647000	2650000	So that's going to be fun. I'm really excited about that panel.
2650000	2653000	So I think that's it. Did I hit all eight? I think I did.
2653000	2660000	If I didn't, then I haven't put it in my calendar yet, which is probably not a good sign, but I will pick that up.
2660000	2662000	I feel like I'm missing one from the podcast track.
2664000	2667000	No, I have them all. That was eight.
2667000	2670000	It's busy. It's going to be busy, but I'm really excited.
2670000	2675000	So if you're going to be at Dragon Con, find me in the app once they get it listed.
2675000	2679000	I will be under Attending Professionals so you can find me, Rob Roberts, and you'll be able to see my whole schedule right there in the app.
2679000	2684000	And please come by. Please don't be shy. Come up and say hello at any of the panels.
2684000	2689000	If your goal is to just say hi to me, I would say go to the ones on the podcasting track.
2689000	2693000	Just for the fact of the matter is, the room is smaller for podcasting.
2693000	2698000	You can imagine these voice actor panels are going to be pretty big, so they'll be using bigger rooms.
2698000	2702000	It'll be easier to kind of talk to me after one of these other panels.
2702000	2704000	But I am really, really, really excited about this.
2704000	2710000	And in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, sj100matt says, contact Rob through his agent Mr. Smoosh.
2710000	2713000	Yes, if you would like to.
2713000	2717000	Mxc says, I wish I were going to Dragon Con. I would love to check out these panels.
2717000	2722000	Hopefully the podcasting track will do a streaming thing. I know they've done that in years past.
2722000	2727000	They live streamed some of it, but I know that was also hit and miss in regards to the quality and stuff.
2727000	2732000	So I don't know if they're still doing it, but cross your fingers on your toes, okay?
2732000	2736000	Some of them get posted to YouTube too, so we'll see.
2736000	2741000	Anyhow, that's my Dragon Con schedule, so I hope to see many of you Labor Day weekend in Atlanta.
2741000	2745000	So enough about me, let's get to some more gaming news.
2745000	2748000	Loki, what's going on in the world of video gaming this week?
2748000	2755000	The world of video gaming is full of Bitcoin mining and all sorts of garbage.
2755000	2760000	So yes, apparently someone snuck a game onto Steam.
2760000	2768000	I should say snuck because, well it was accepted on Steam, but they snuck a crypto-jacking program in there as well.
2768000	2780000	So the game was called Abstractism, and basically what was happening is that they were noticing that the game is very minimal looking,
2780000	2784000	but for some reason their CPUs and GPUs were taxing from the game.
2784000	2790000	And so people started wondering, well is this a virus? I mean, what's going on?
2790000	2798000	And so apparently, after looking through the game, they found out that, oh hey, it's a cryptocurrency miner.
2798000	2804000	So it did end up getting pulled off of Steam, thanks to Valve.
2804000	2805000	Yeah, thanks.
2805000	2814000	Once it was pointed out, but the developer of course says, you know, abstractism doesn't mine any cryptocurrency.
2814000	2822000	Probably you are playing on high graphics settings because they take a bit of CPU and GPU power for the post-processing effects rendering.
2822000	2834000	Yeah, except the game apparently found that, you know, running on a virtual machine, that the resource usage is unrelated to graphical rendering,
2834000	2840000	as it persisted even when the game is not being rendered, or being rendered by a separate GPU.
2840000	2845000	So it was a big ol' scam, and it got removed.
2845000	2852000	Basically they said they removed abstractism and banned its developer from Steam for shipping with unauthorized code, trolling, scamming.
2852000	2857000	Yeah, how much money did he make first though? Like, how much Bitcoin was he able to mine because of this?
2857000	2859000	Probably not much, if anything.
2859000	2862000	Haven't they mined all the Bitcoin by now? Isn't that well dry?
2862000	2869000	It's harder to do it now, and I just don't think that they would have. I mean, this thing looks like it's drawn, like, with a pencil.
2869000	2872000	I mean, it's very minimalistic, so I can't imagine-
2872000	2874000	Well, because it's trying to use your processor to mine Bitcoin.
2874000	2881000	Yeah, I can't imagine that there'd be any pro- like, it just doesn't seem very processor-intensive, so I- it's definitely bullshit, but whatever.
2881000	2884000	So at least that's done. Um, and then, you know, there's-
2884000	2888000	More garbage on the Steam store, because they barely moderate it. What a shock!
2888000	2899000	Yes! Well, speaking of more garbage on the Steam store, so, there's an issue with, um, fake items, dummy items, masquerading as Team Fortress 2 or Dota 2 rarities.
2899000	2914000	And, so what they're doing is, apparently people are sneaking games onto Steam again, as called something else, but they use, like, an icon or items that look exactly like the items that are in, um, Team Fortress 2 or Dota 2.
2914000	2927000	So when you're looking at them on, you know, the boards to swap stuff, when you're going through that and trying to buy, um, these rare items, you may notice that they look the same, and so you might purchase it by mistake.
2928000	2936000	So, um, apparently, they're saying that, you know, we started, um, requiring approval for app name changes.
2936000	2946000	So yeah, what would happen is they'd put it up like, you know, my game is dumb shit, you know, platformer 2, and then, once you get in there, I'm gonna change my name to Team Fortress 2 now.
2946000	2950000	Just after it's already on there, and then, you know, fuck with shit.
2950000	2959000	Um, so basically, we started requiring approval for app name changes and have more planned to address this sort of problem that we couldn't get done in one day.
2959000	2971000	We're hoping to have to dismiss two warning dialogues and be sufficient to make people think twice about trades containing forged items, but this is not the end of our response. We'll continue the monitor, of course.
2971000	2976000	I just gotta think, you know, with this whole, like, crap that goes on.
2976000	2979000	The Steam store is messy. It is messy.
2979000	2988000	Remember how crappy, or like, I didn't think it was that crappy to begin with, Steam Greenlight? I'm kinda wishing we had Steam Greenlight again, because this is bullshit.
2988000	2993000	I do too. I just think a lot of changes the store's made in the past few years, it's just, it's a mess. It's a mess.
2993000	3001000	It's fine if you wanna go grab, like, if you know that, like, Civ 6 is out, and you know exactly where you're going to get it and all that stuff, but as far as, like, discovery and all that, it's a mess.
3001000	3008000	And, you know, the whole process before, like, I think the getting rid of the Steam Greenlight was, well, we just don't really wanna vet this stuff anymore, and it's like,
3008000	3019000	well, we can make a lot more money if everybody is, you know, able to pay us $100 to put any game up, but it, they thought $100 would be a barrier to entry for anybody to put stuff up on the store, but it's not.
3019000	3020000	No, it's not.
3020000	3029000	It's no barrier whatsoever, and I think as terrible as Greenlight was, I kinda wish it was back, because this is, it's even worse now.
3029000	3036000	Yeah, I agree. And, you know, ST-100 Matt brings up, at least when YYR made a game about shit, he stuck to it and didn't change it.
3036000	3047000	Well, you know, speaking of a different game that YYR made, you know, it's, in my opinion, it is still a crime that Super Multitasking is not, like, an all-star game that everybody is talking about.
3047000	3052000	Like, and it's because Steam is such a mess, that game probably never gets featured, unfortunately.
3052000	3066000	It's, it's probably really hard to stick out amongst, you know, it's just, it's just hard to hear about these, like, apps, or these games that are secretly Bitcoin miners and shit, when it's like, you know, there's gems out there, like Super Multitasking.
3066000	3073000	Or games that are put up on there, where they're, like, you can't pass the first level, where it's just, like, absolute basic stuff is broken.
3073000	3074000	Yeah.
3074000	3080000	Or they seem executable, or they, yeah, executable for the game is not included with it, or something ridiculous.
3080000	3086000	Rage Nator does point out Greenlight was abused a good percentage of the time, essentially, will give you this $10 game for free if you upvoted on Greenlight.
3086000	3092000	I understand that it was, you know, it was abused, but this is far worse now.
3092000	3101000	Now, you know, where they don't have to go through that whole step of, like, trying to get people to upvote it, now it's just, I'm just gonna literally shit into the marketplace.
3101000	3108000	You know, sometimes it could be one game that they've cloned, like, five or six times under different names, and they'll just throw that shit up on there.
3110000	3111000	I don't know.
3111000	3119000	All right. Well, anyhow, let's move on and talk about, you know, when Steam becomes such a mess, you might turn to other ways to get your games, like piracy.
3119000	3122000	Just get, don't pirate games, you shouldn't do that, because A.
3122000	3123000	All the time.
3123000	3128000	You need to support developers, and B, you can get banned from your Nintendo system from doing it.
3128000	3137000	We talked already about the Switch, and how the Switch had made this change, where it's getting a little better at detecting pirated software, and basically banning your Nintendo account.
3137000	3138000	Well, guess what happened this week?
3138000	3141000	The 3DS also got a firmware update.
3141000	3142000	That's right.
3142000	3149000	The firmware update that came out this week on the 3DS, which a lot of people are paying attention to this week, because that new WarioWare game, which I still need to grab.
3149000	3154000	The WarioWare Gold, because I guess it does have new stuff, as well as, like, old stuff, so I'm in if there's new stuff.
3154000	3159000	So the new WarioWare game came out on 3DS, so everybody's checking it out, but they have to update their firmware to do it.
3160000	3173000	3DS firmware update implements this same feature that will detect a pirated game, and if it senses you running it, you will have your Nintendo account and your system banned, because you're a dirty, filthy pirate.
3173000	3175000	So, at least in Nintendo's eyes.
3175000	3176000	Not my words, theirs, no.
3176000	3181000	Anyway, all seriousness, that is something that Nintendo is really trying to push against.
3182000	3188000	Very interesting to see Nintendo ramp up a lot of these efforts recently between not just the Switch firmware, but 3DS firmware.
3188000	3194000	We had that story about the ROM sites last week, so it'll be interesting to see what continues, but I know, I know.
3194000	3201000	What y'all really want to see is, okay, if they're shutting down all this stuff about the classic games, where's their solution for the Switch already?
3201000	3206000	Which, hopefully, we will finally know about in the coming months, but who knows?
3206000	3210000	I feel like I've been saying that like a broken record for a couple years, so we will see.
3210000	3213000	Meanwhile, other big, big things in gaming, Dark Sakura.
3223000	3229000	Well, parents want their children to be successful, don't you think? Good parents do.
3229000	3231000	I would hope so, yeah.
3231000	3239000	So there are parents who are hiring video game tutors to teach their kids how to be good at Fortnite and other games.
3241000	3251000	It was reported by the Wall Street Journal that there are families who have hired tutors to help them get better at video games, charging over $50 an hour for the service,
3251000	3263000	so that they will be able to attend schools, scholarships, or get scholarships at schools that offer incentive to gamers that join tournament teams.
3264000	3270000	And so these parents are investing in their video game skills.
3270000	3278000	I don't see a problem with this, but this is basically if you were to kind of draw parallels with any sports type stuff, like football.
3278000	3284000	It's like people trying to go professional with football and stuff, and training people that way.
3284000	3287000	I used to have a private tutor for saxophone.
3287000	3298000	Yeah, so I mean, whatever they want to use their money on, as long as they're teaching their kids as well, that listen, you have to have a strong education foundation,
3298000	3307000	but this might help you get in the door as well, but if this doesn't work out, have this to rely on as well.
3307000	3316000	I mean, there's no problem with, if you can get in a football scholarship and go to a really nice school, more power to you, but you gotta have the grades to back that up, too.
3317000	3322000	Yeah, I mean, honestly, I don't hate this news, and I'm not gonna make fun of it.
3322000	3326000	If this is something a parent wants to spend money on for their kid, go for it.
3326000	3333000	And that answer might surprise you guys, because I see a lot of talk on social media kind of poo-pooing this news about,
3333000	3338000	LOL, what kind of parent would hire a tutor for a video game for their kid and all that stuff,
3338000	3345000	but you gave the exact same example I was gonna give, is that people do it for football, baseball.
3345000	3347000	People do it for competitive sports all the time.
3347000	3348000	Pageantry.
3348000	3349000	Why not?
3349000	3357000	Singing. How many people hire singing coaches, because their son or daughter is gonna be the next American Idol or something?
3357000	3362000	Yes and no. I'm gonna separate the arts a little bit differently from competitive sports.
3362000	3366000	I don't wanna draw direct parallels, like even though Dark Soccer has had a saxophone tutor and stuff,
3366000	3372000	maybe this is just because I grew up band nerd, but I do still feel there is a difference with tutoring in the arts,
3373000	3375000	and that is a very different bubble from this.
3375000	3380000	But this is not the first time I've heard of tutors being hired for competitive sports, and that's what Fortnite is.
3380000	3381000	It's a competitive sport.
3381000	3386000	You can't make fun of this, in my opinion, you can't make fun of this, and then in the same breath go,
3386000	3391000	but I don't understand why ESPN won't show e-gaming sports.
3391000	3393000	The future is here, people.
3393000	3396000	ESPN is showing that type of stuff now.
3396000	3403000	The Overwatch League is pushing this ceiling that video games have had when it comes to competitive sports higher and higher,
3403000	3406000	and not just Overwatch League, I mean that's the first thing that comes to mind,
3406000	3410000	but look at EVO getting more and more mainstream stuff, and other gaming things as well.
3410000	3419000	As our generation, the Generation X and the Millennials and the Zillennials, you know what I mean though?
3419000	3420000	The Zennials.
3420000	3421000	Zennials, excuse me.
3421000	3426000	But you know what I mean, the generations that are our age, as we all grew up with video games,
3426000	3430000	and as we are getting older and we are making the purchasing decisions for the households and so forth,
3430000	3434000	this is that natural step, is that that type of stuff is now, like,
3434000	3440000	Overwatch is as much a competitive sport to enjoy watching as bowling, or the other stuff they show.
3440000	3444000	Maybe you should compare it with bowling, because bowling is kind of boring.
3444000	3447000	But, Loki, in all seriousness, it depends on who you are.
3447000	3450000	Like, you know, I've known people that were like competitive bowlers.
3450000	3454000	He kind of turned out to be a jerk though, but I mean, I have known people that do that stuff,
3454000	3457000	and if that's what you're into, then cool, you know what I mean?
3457000	3459000	Fine, as long as you're not hurting anybody, right?
3459000	3465000	So, but anyway, I just, yeah, I don't hate this story.
3465000	3468000	As long as, and you know, I think Dark Sakura kind of references too,
3468000	3473000	as long as the kid is going outside, getting fresh air, getting vitamin D,
3473000	3476000	interacting with other kids, doing the other things,
3476000	3480000	then honestly, I see no difference between this and football coaching.
3480000	3484000	Except the fact that, yes, football coaching is more physical in nature,
3484000	3489000	but Fortnite is mental, I suppose, mental activity.
3489000	3490000	Chess coaching.
3490000	3492000	And I'm not, sure, chess coaching.
3492000	3495000	And I'm not saying, hold that kid up inside all day.
3495000	3497000	Let the kid go outside and play in the mud.
3497000	3500000	That's what kids do, you know, let the kid go outside and play in traffic.
3500000	3502000	No, just kidding, don't do that, but you know what I mean.
3502000	3504000	Let them go outside and be kids too.
3504000	3510000	I'm sure there are going to be stage parent horror stories in Fortnite,
3510000	3512000	but again, all these other things we named have them too.
3512000	3514000	Well, the other thing that's kind of unique about Fortnite
3514000	3517000	and like other games of the like are,
3517000	3520000	they're probably not going to be around forever either.
3520000	3522000	I mean, just because Fortnite's popular right now,
3522000	3524000	next year could be a whole other game.
3524000	3527000	So don't get necessarily focused on one game,
3527000	3530000	just become better at gaming altogether.
3530000	3533000	Okay, go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
3533000	3534000	Dungeon Buster says,
3534000	3537000	I remember when people were looking for tutors when Age of Empire was huge.
3537000	3539000	So it's always something.
3539000	3541000	Let's see, S2100Matt says,
3541000	3545000	I hope those tutors are teaching kids to be good people online as well.
3545000	3549000	I also hope the tutor teaches the kids how to properly balance gaming,
3549000	3552000	school, work, and other real life things as well.
3552000	3556000	Well, I would hope good sportsmanship is a part of that tutor
3556000	3558000	because this may shock you guys.
3558000	3560000	You may not know this about me,
3560000	3564000	but when I was a kid, I played soccer for many years.
3564000	3567000	Apparently, I was pretty good at being a goalie.
3567000	3570000	So I did soccer from the time I was like five
3570000	3573000	until probably I left it behind to join band when I was 12.
3573000	3575000	So I played soccer for a very long time.
3575000	3578000	And a good coach is going,
3578000	3581000	as I had many coaches during those years when I played soccer,
3581000	3584000	a good coach is going to teach you about good sportsmanship
3584000	3586000	and that, you know, when you lose a game,
3586000	3588000	you don't fucking like yell at the other team and stuff.
3588000	3590000	You still shake their hand and say, good game.
3590000	3595000	So again, a similar parallel to what already exists in our society
3595000	3598000	when it comes to other sports and things like that.
3598000	3602000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, some other comments.
3602000	3604000	Let's see, Bobby Blackwell says,
3604000	3608000	I watched a competitive cornhole tournament a few weeks ago.
3608000	3610000	You know, the game you play at tailgates
3610000	3612000	where you throw the bag into the hole.
3612000	3616000	It was on ESPN, not 2 or the Ocho.
3616000	3620000	No, that is a legit thing. I was at a bar last week.
3620000	3623000	I was actually convinced to go to a straight bar,
3623000	3625000	which doesn't always happen, but I went
3625000	3627000	and they were playing that cornhole game.
3627000	3629000	And that wasn't the first time I'd heard about it either
3629000	3631000	because I actually was looking into this whole thing
3631000	3635000	where like locally they have these different sports leagues.
3635000	3637000	I felt like I found it on Reddit.
3637000	3639000	Somebody was asking about things to do in town on Reddit
3639000	3642000	and somebody suggested like, well, if you want to meet people,
3642000	3644000	this sports league is really popular.
3644000	3645000	And I don't remember the name of it,
3645000	3647000	but it basically like they have the stuff you would expect
3647000	3650000	to see like a neighborhood softball.
3650000	3652000	I don't think you do baseball with softball team
3652000	3654000	or maybe it's T-ball, one of those things
3654000	3656000	or a neighborhood bowling is always a big thing with that.
3656000	3659000	But they actually had like, you know, a cornhole thing.
3659000	3661000	And I was like, what the fuck is cornhole?
3661000	3662000	And I actually did.
3662000	3664000	And then it was like not even like a few days
3664000	3666000	after reading that on Reddit.
3666000	3668000	Then I actually saw people playing it at this bar
3668000	3670000	and I was like, oh, they're playing that game
3670000	3673000	I was reading about, which is you throw a bag into a hole
3673000	3678000	and it's not like the sport exists basically.
3678000	3681000	So that sport exists for people that maybe
3681000	3684000	they just want to be there for the social aspect
3684000	3687000	and, you know, play a game that's less strenuous,
3687000	3689000	I suppose, than maybe something like ice hockey.
3689000	3691000	You know what I mean?
3691000	3695000	So, yeah. Yeah. Why not?
3695000	3698000	I mean, golf, it's kind of a lot of you do walk.
3698000	3699000	You do walk a lot in golf.
3699000	3701000	You have to, you know, you don't.
3701000	3703000	True, true. All right.
3703000	3706000	Bobby Bockel says it's huge at tailgating.
3706000	3708000	Yes, it's a branded beanbag toss.
3708000	3709000	It sure is.
3709000	3711000	I'm pretty sure this thing I was looking at at the bar
3711000	3713000	was one of the beer companies was sponsoring it.
3713000	3715000	So that's that's the thing.
3715000	3717000	So anyhow, there you go.
3717000	3719000	Wow. All these different talks on sports,
3719000	3720000	all because of tutors in Fortnite.
3720000	3723000	But Fortnite is just that big of a deal right now.
3723000	3726000	It's the game of the moment, you know?
3726000	3727000	Yes.
3727000	3728000	All right.
3728000	3732000	I the one I guess the one element and then I promise to move on.
3732000	3735000	The one element, though, is that you also don't like half,
3735000	3739000	even though I'm not like laughing at this news and saying this is stupid.
3739000	3743000	Like at the same time, you don't have to hire a tutor.
3743000	3745000	Just play Fortnite a lot.
3745000	3750000	And and if you're a parent, get involved with your kid playing Fortnite.
3750000	3753000	Watch them, cheer them on, support them,
3753000	3755000	help them notice some of the things on the screen.
3755000	3756000	Maybe they're missing.
3756000	3759000	Well, I think that these parents are doing that because that's why
3759000	3762000	they're doing the tutoring is because they are playing with them
3762000	3765000	and they want them to be better.
3765000	3768000	I don't know. I just hope it's not like they want them to get good.
3768000	3770000	Yet you brought up the pageant thing.
3770000	3773000	And you know, a lot of kids get involved in those pageants
3773000	3776000	because it's, you know, mom living out her fantasy.
3776000	3777000	I don't think so.
3777000	3781000	They're like, I mean, I am sure that there's some instances where,
3781000	3784000	like, you know, somebody might be convincing someone to play something.
3784000	3788000	But I think it's just more like encouraging them with what they want.
3788000	3791000	They see, you know, it's just like myself, like he wants to be a YouTuber
3791000	3793000	because he watches YouTubers.
3793000	3796000	It's like if someone's watching Twitch streamers of Fortnite players,
3796000	3798000	they're going to want to be a Fortnite player
3798000	3801000	because that's what they watch is what they want to do.
3801000	3803000	So you just have to support them.
3803000	3807000	And then eventually they'll either stick with it or they'll grow out of it.
3807000	3810000	I wanted to be in construction and engineering.
3810000	3813000	My wife would have preferred if I went into engineering.
3813000	3817000	I did not go into engineering because I'm, you know.
3817000	3820000	This is a struggle that lasts until college, okay?
3820000	3825000	I went to college and originally I was doing computer science and I hated it.
3825000	3829000	And then I got into, I was going to be a weatherman on TV.
3829000	3833000	And I interned at a CBS station in the town where I went to school
3833000	3834000	and all this stuff.
3834000	3837000	And as much as, like, I learned a lot from the experience,
3837000	3839000	I also learned from that experience.
3839000	3842000	This is absolutely not what I want to do.
3842000	3847000	Like, now that I've seen the reality of what goes into, I do not want to do this.
3847000	3849000	You don't want to go stand in the hurricane?
3849000	3852000	It's just, it's a lot more depressing.
3852000	3854000	My friend's dad is actually a hurricane chaser.
3854000	3855000	Yeah.
3855000	3858000	And that's, you know, I'm not going to bash the people that do it.
3858000	3859000	It's actually quite the opposite.
3859000	3867000	Like, I realized I don't have the strength and the self-esteem
3867000	3869000	to handle something like that.
3869000	3871000	You know what my original major was before I changed it to Japanese?
3871000	3873000	Forensic geology.
3873000	3875000	Oh, wow. That's kind of cool.
3875000	3877000	And I decided rocks are boring.
3877000	3882000	But at the same time, like, A, the day job that I do have as a corporate trainer,
3882000	3884000	like, I love it. It's awesome.
3884000	3886000	And I feel like, you know, cool.
3886000	3889000	I found this not through school, but through working my way up into it.
3889000	3890000	And that's awesome.
3890000	3894000	And B, you know, it's not that the broadcasting stuff I learned in college
3894000	3898000	went completely to waste because, look, here we are.
3898000	3902000	Like, you know, and I can say, I'm using my quoting fingers.
3902000	3906000	I built this, obviously, with Jamie and Loki,
3906000	3909000	but I can still look at it and go, as opposed to, like, you know,
3909000	3912000	something where it had to be done on somebody else's terms,
3912000	3915000	reporting to somebody else and ratings and all this other stuff,
3915000	3918000	I can look at this and go, but no, we have this,
3918000	3923000	and this is something that I helped build, and we do it by our rules.
3923000	3924000	You know what I mean?
3924000	3926000	But I do wish we had the ratings.
3926000	3930000	Well, you know what, there came a point a long time ago
3930000	3932000	where I just kind of realized if that was going to happen,
3932000	3934000	it would have happened, and it hasn't, but that's okay.
3934000	3936000	You know what, though, Loki?
3936000	3939000	But, like, there's that, but at the same time, like, you know,
3939000	3942000	it's taken a long time, but, like, the fact that I'm doing these panels
3942000	3945000	at Dragon Con is pretty amazing.
3945000	3947000	Not everybody gets to do that.
3947000	3950000	So, like, I'm thankful for that. I'm super thankful.
3950000	3953000	Okay, so I'm not PewDiePie, but who would want to be him?
3953000	3955000	He's an asshole.
3955000	3956000	But you know what I mean?
3956000	3962000	Like, with the spotlight can also come a lot of that negativity
3962000	3966000	of where everything you do is scrutinized type of thing.
3966000	3968000	You know, maybe not the best name for me to throw out there
3968000	3971000	because he deserved to be scrutinized for some of those things that he did,
3971000	3972000	but you know what I mean?
3972000	3975000	Like, I also really like my privacy.
3975000	3979000	Like, you know, sure, Sunday night we do this show.
3979000	3981000	We have our small little audience.
3981000	3982000	I love you guys.
3982000	3984000	We're a great little family here on Sunday nights and so forth
3984000	3986000	and throughout the week with the podcast feed.
3986000	3987000	I don't want to leave you guys out either.
3987000	3992000	That's all fantastic, but y'all are nice and respectful of my privacy.
3992000	3995000	I like that. You know what I mean?
3995000	3999000	Knock on wood, I'm not getting death threats.
3999000	4003000	And unfortunately, that's some of the stuff that comes with getting bigger.
4003000	4008000	When we were at our peak, when iTunes first launched podcasting
4008000	4011000	and we were one of only a handful of video game podcasts
4011000	4014000	the day that iTunes launched podcasting in the store,
4014000	4017000	we did have to taste a little bit of that unfortunate side.
4017000	4020000	Like, people at dark soccer, you got it worse than anyone
4020000	4022000	because unfortunately, you're a girl gamer.
4022000	4025000	And fuck all those idiots. I don't give a shit what they think.
4025000	4027000	Well, guess what? You're still here.
4027000	4028000	Where are they?
4028000	4029000	They're not.
4029000	4030000	They're not?
4030000	4032000	They have their kids and they've been punished.
4033000	4035000	Guess who doesn't have kids?
4037000	4039000	Anyway, let's see.
4039000	4042000	Bobby Blackwell says, hey, at least you're not interviewing Billy Mitchell.
4042000	4044000	Bobby Blackwell has seen his variety.
4044000	4047000	I would totally want to interview him because I don't give a shit about him
4047000	4049000	and that's the best kind of mentality to have.
4049000	4051000	That's why you don't get to interview him.
4051000	4052000	Here's the thing.
4052000	4053000	Oh, come on.
4053000	4054000	Here's the thing.
4054000	4055000	I ask the hard-hitting questions.
4055000	4057000	Remember, Konami, Jason Enos?
4057000	4059000	Here's the thing. Here's the thing.
4059000	4064000	As much as Bobby has kind of taken a few licks over that whole interview
4064000	4066000	and the article and everything,
4066000	4072000	at the same time, it is a perfect example of all publicity is good publicity
4072000	4075000	because it did get...
4075000	4078000	Now Bobby gets to say, as seen on Variety,
4079000	4084000	Bobby gets to say he was at that infamous panel with Billy Mitchell.
4084000	4089000	Bobby got invites to other shows he probably wouldn't have been a part of
4089000	4092000	if he hadn't done that because he got that publicity.
4092000	4093000	You know what I mean?
4093000	4095000	So he's growing his own networking from that.
4095000	4099000	So, I mean, yes, was it probably difficult for him in some ways?
4099000	4101000	I'm sure it was to read some of that negativity and stuff,
4101000	4105000	but at the same time, I still think he's emerged from that whole experience
4105000	4109000	bigger as a name than he was before.
4109000	4111000	So, anyway.
4111000	4112000	Let's see.
4112000	4115000	Other comments in chat at live.vognetwork.com.
4115000	4118000	Oh, well, this is depressing.
4118000	4121000	I hate to interrupt.
4121000	4123000	There's horrible dead celebrity news.
4123000	4125000	Are you ready for this, DarkSakura?
4125000	4126000	I dropped my phone.
4126000	4128000	The guy that played Cornelius Fudge died?
4128000	4129000	No, this is worse.
4129000	4130000	That he did, though.
4130000	4131000	This is worse.
4131000	4135000	Charlotte Rae, also Mrs. Garrett on The Facts of Life and Different Strokes,
4135000	4137000	passed away, but 92.
4137000	4138000	Well, he was also 92.
4138000	4139000	Yeah.
4139000	4141000	So, I mean, bless her heart.
4141000	4143000	So that's unfortunate.
4143000	4148000	And y'all know I grew up on The Facts of Life.
4148000	4149000	Well...
4149000	4150000	I saw a lot of myself in Joe.
4150000	4152000	I don't know what it was, but...
4152000	4156000	Betty White sacrifices yet another to take her place.
4156000	4157000	So...
4157000	4158000	Alright, anyhow.
4158000	4162000	Well, rest in peace, Charlotte Rae, who, of course, I loved,
4162000	4165000	loved The Facts of Life growing up, so that's depressing.
4165000	4166000	Anyway, let's move on.
4166000	4168000	We do have some more video game news.
4168000	4170000	More Fortnite stuff, right, Logie?
4170000	4171000	Ah, yes.
4171000	4177000	So, Fortnite will not be coming to your neighborly Google Play Store
4177000	4183000	because they take 30% of the in-app purchases for games sold through their storefront.
4183000	4185000	And, as Epic would put it,
4185000	4189000	the 30% tax is a high cost in a world where game developers,
4189000	4198000	70% must cover all of the costs of game developing, operating, and supporting their games.
4198000	4200000	And this is from Tim Sweeney.
4200000	4204000	And basically saying that what they're going to do instead is
4204000	4207000	they're going to maintain a direct relationship with their consumers.
4207000	4212000	They're going to have a stand-alone installer for the Android version of the game.
4212000	4216000	Which, you know, being that they are on that platform,
4216000	4218000	and, you know, to the benefit, I guess, of Android users,
4218000	4222000	that it's an open marketplace, so you don't have to use the Google Play Store if you don't want to,
4222000	4226000	unlike Apple and their closed marketplace where they have to go through that.
4226000	4229000	They can, I guess, do that.
4231000	4232000	So...
4233000	4235000	Well, I guess it's a good way to get around the 30%.
4235000	4236000	Yeah, right.
4236000	4238000	I mean, it's kind of diabolical in some ways.
4238000	4242000	It's not like, you know, yeah, I mean, because they're a big enough game where it's like,
4242000	4246000	we can do whatever the fuck we want. We don't need your fucking advertising.
4246000	4247000	We're Fortnite, bitch.
4247000	4250000	We're Fortnite, bitch, yeah. Exactly.
4250000	4251000	All right.
4251000	4253000	Going to chat at live.vognetwork.com.
4253000	4254000	Bobby Blackwell says,
4254000	4259000	The worry here is that everyone has to turn on developer tools to sideload the app,
4259000	4262000	and that leaves a lot of unprotected phones for malware.
4262000	4264000	People like Loki and I already have that turned on,
4264000	4268000	but you are potentially exposing your phone to other threats by doing that,
4268000	4271000	especially when we're talking about that there are kids that play Fortnite,
4271000	4273000	as we just heard in the last story.
4273000	4274000	Yeah.
4274000	4278000	So, that is an unfortunate side effect to all that,
4278000	4283000	so hopefully Epic will kind of have some responsibility in kind of educating people,
4283000	4286000	since they are going around the store and they are such a big game,
4286000	4291000	on how to prevent from getting malware and that stuff on your phone.
4291000	4293000	Or maybe, can you open it and then close it?
4293000	4295000	Can you open it, grab the game, then close it?
4295000	4296000	Does that work?
4296000	4300000	Right, but then anytime you push something to it though,
4300000	4303000	like updates and stuff, they may need to do it again.
4303000	4304000	I don't know.
4304000	4307000	It's hard to say how they're going to have it set up.
4307000	4309000	They could have it where they just install it
4309000	4314000	and it installs other supplemental files without permissions.
4314000	4315000	I don't know.
4315000	4316000	I don't know.
4316000	4317000	All right.
4317000	4321000	Well, let's shift gears here a little bit and talk about some Bioware news.
4321000	4325000	And you all know that I've been a little salty when it comes to things Bioware,
4325000	4326000	because of what happened with Mass Effect.
4326000	4327000	You have me both.
4327000	4328000	Yeah, I know Jamie's right there with me.
4328000	4333000	But some interesting comments in a new blog from Casey Hudson,
4333000	4334000	who's the boss of Bioware now,
4334000	4337000	who of course was the big name behind the Mass Effect trilogy.
4337000	4341000	Interesting in the Midsummer update, he went on to say,
4341000	4346000	We hear loud and clear the interest in Bioware doing more Dragon Age and Mass Effect.
4346000	4350000	So rest assured that we have some teams hidden away
4350000	4354000	working on some secret stuff that I think you'll really like.
4354000	4357000	We're just not ready to talk about it for a little while.
4357000	4361000	Will we get our Quarian DLC for Andromeda, please?
4361000	4363000	Sadly, I don't think that's going to happen.
4363000	4364000	What about the remaster?
4364000	4365000	Do you think that might come?
4365000	4368000	The other thing I was thinking of is that, you know,
4368000	4372000	that thing that I thought would have happened between Mass Effect 3 and Andromeda,
4372000	4375000	a multiplayer mode spin-off, basically,
4375000	4378000	because the multiplayer mode in Mass Effect is pretty darn good.
4378000	4381000	I think 3 was a little better than Andromeda's,
4381000	4383000	but Andromeda's wasn't bad by any means.
4383000	4387000	So it would be interesting if maybe they expanded on that with another multiplayer game,
4387000	4390000	which would certainly meet all of the soul-sucking EA needs
4390000	4393000	of microtransactions and loot boxes and all that shit.
4393000	4398000	Whatever. You could do enough in those games without ever buying a single treasure box.
4398000	4400000	You could if you wanted to.
4400000	4404000	I know sometimes we did with leftover currency and what have you from Origin,
4404000	4408000	but, I mean, at the end of the day, you could do a lot in those games without buying the dumb boxes.
4408000	4410000	So, I don't know. What do you think, Jamie?
4410000	4412000	Do you think they're maybe working on a full new Mass Effect game,
4412000	4415000	or do you think maybe it's some silly side story or what?
4415000	4418000	I have no idea as long as it's just not fucking Anthem.
4418000	4420000	And not a mobile phone game.
4420000	4423000	If it's a mobile phone game, fuck right off.
4423000	4426000	Now, Mass Effect Mobile was very good
4426000	4430000	when it was like the galaxy map thing that interacted with the game.
4430000	4432000	That was cool.
4432000	4435000	But if it's like, oh, we've got this brand new Mass Effect game,
4435000	4437000	but it's a mobile phone, fuck off.
4437000	4440000	Please don't let me near that announcement.
4440000	4443000	I don't know if we'll see microtransactions in a new Mass Effect game
4443000	4446000	just because they're making so much off of their sports game titles.
4446000	4449000	I don't know if you read this week, there was some guy that was in Europe
4449000	4452000	that part of their new law or whatever, the privacy laws,
4452000	4457000	they can request information from any company that's collecting data on them
4457000	4459000	to see what kind of data they have.
4459000	4464000	And he looked at his purchases for FIFA, the boxes and stuff.
4464000	4469000	He spent over 16,000 euro in the last two years on that stuff
4469000	4474000	because he has that kind of expendable income.
4474000	4478000	I never want to see my receipts from Pokémon GO.
4478000	4484000	I never want to see how much I've spent on Pokémon GO
4484000	4487000	because I will be so upset and mad.
4487000	4494000	But that's, you know, they're making 16,000 off of one person.
4494000	4497000	I mean, granted, that is an outlier.
4497000	4499000	They're making bank.
4499000	4503000	And so they don't need to put the same face in some of the other games,
4503000	4506000	but I don't know. It's still sickening.
4506000	4508000	All right. Well, let's move on with some more news
4508000	4511000	about some things we know are happening based on footage, right, Jamie?
4511000	4515000	Yes. I'm sure our Persona fans will be super thrilled with this.
4515000	4520000	The next RPG that's coming out is Persona Q2 New Cinema Labyrinth.
4520000	4523000	They just had a new trailer come out that released some details.
4523000	4529000	So cast from past three of the mainline games are going to be coming in.
4530000	4534000	It actually has a little chibi version of the Persona 5 Phantom Thieves.
4534000	4537000	So it fits the whole style.
4537000	4541000	And then there are going to be new characters thrown into it as well.
4541000	4547000	They also showed that you can have the party made up of three main protagonists.
4547000	4552000	And that you can also see the Persona 3 protagonist casting a spell
4552000	4554000	with Persona 5-style graphics.
4554000	4556000	And so it's just interesting stuff.
4556000	4560000	But I'm sure all of our Persona fans are going to be completely thrilled about this.
4560000	4566000	Of course, as we know, Persona is a spinoff of the Shin Megami Tensei games.
4566000	4569000	So enjoy.
4570000	4572000	I wish I got more into the Persona games.
4572000	4575000	Like, they have their fans and they love them.
4575000	4580000	But I'm just, oh my god, it's so many hours of game. You know what I mean?
4580000	4585000	I have some of the Saturn ones that I got off Etsy not too long ago.
4585000	4587000	Haven't played any of them.
4587000	4592000	Speaking of Shin Megami Tensei, I was told that there is a new mobile phone game,
4592000	4596000	Shin Megami Tensei Liberation DX2, that's now available.
4596000	4598000	And that we should check that out.
4598000	4600000	Make it so.
4600000	4602000	Make it so. Maybe I will. I will do that.
4602000	4605000	Alright. Let's move on.
4605000	4608000	Talk about a few more stories before we get to the classic peripheral of the month.
4608000	4609000	Loki.
4609000	4612000	Hey, there's a new console coming. I bet you didn't expect that.
4612000	4615000	This is a console that's not from one of your normal console makers.
4615000	4622000	This is actually a collaboration between AMD and a Chinese company called Zhongshan's Sabur.
4622000	4627000	And they're creating a custom console hardware for the Chinese market.
4627000	4631000	Now, spec-wise, it's kind of similar to a Playstation 4 Pro.
4631000	4633000	It's going to be using Ryzen as well.
4633000	4637000	It's basically a system on a chip that's Ryzen and the RX Vega.
4638000	4643000	And it's going to, like I said, spec-wise, it's pretty similar to the Playstation Pro.
4643000	4646000	They've got 8 gigs of GDDR5.
4646000	4654000	They're saying that they're not using DDR4 RAM.
4654000	4658000	But it's basically going to be similar to the setup of the Playstation 4.
4658000	4666000	The system on the chip, they've got 24 compute units, 1.3 gigahertz for 3.99 teraflops of GPU power.
4668000	4671000	And I've got to say, though, they do have a picture of what the console looks like.
4671000	4673000	It's sexy-looking.
4674000	4678000	But I'm kind of curious to see, though, what the hell this is going to be used for.
4678000	4682000	Because such a powerful console, what's going to be on it?
4682000	4684000	Well, unfortunately, it's not a Playstation 4.
4684000	4688000	But the good news is, it's just going to be copies of PS4 games.
4690000	4691000	I'm kidding.
4691000	4694000	They did say, though, they're also going to release the console.
4694000	4698000	There's going to be a version of the console that's just a computer, like a PC.
4698000	4701000	But they're going to have actual games for it, though.
4701000	4704000	But I'm kind of curious to see what this is.
4704000	4707000	I'd be kind of curious to find out what's going to be running on this thing.
4707000	4711000	Yeah, you always wonder, is there going to be a big game that's on one of these consoles?
4711000	4714000	Man, I want to play that. Bring that out over here.
4714000	4719000	Yeah, so check it out and see what the pricing is and go from there, I guess.
4719000	4720000	Well, the wait.
4721000	4723000	In chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Rama says,
4723000	4727000	Hold up, Ryzen? Bro, that's leaps and bounds over Playstation 4 Pro.
4727000	4730000	Tigerglass says, I've been hearing a lot about those Ryzen CPUs.
4730000	4733000	They are powerful, but not as powerful as Intel, though.
4733000	4735000	And here's the thing.
4735000	4737000	Again, though, the whole golden rule of gaming, though,
4737000	4739000	is the system is only as good as the games that are on it.
4739000	4744000	But you did open the door there with the hole, but they have this PC type of build.
4744000	4747000	That makes it a little bit different, I suppose.
4747000	4749000	But otherwise, it could have all the teraflops at once.
4749000	4751000	If the games are shitty, it's not going to matter.
4751000	4753000	You know what I mean?
4753000	4755000	Right, I have no idea.
4755000	4758000	Because, I mean, China is just getting into the console market.
4758000	4764000	Because up until quite recently, they were banned from being over there.
4764000	4769000	So it is kind of curious to see that we may have another contender.
4769000	4772000	And that's kind of funny, because even in the mobile space now,
4772000	4776000	we've got contenders for mobile phones that are these Chinese companies
4776000	4777000	that no one's ever heard of.
4777000	4780000	And all of a sudden, they're like, oh, hey, these phones fucking kick ass.
4780000	4784000	So it's interesting to see what happens out of this.
4784000	4787000	All right, well, we'll see when maybe some games get announced for this.
4787000	4789000	Who knows?
4789000	4792000	A game that has been announced that I know a lot of us are excited to play
4792000	4796000	is Pokemon Let's Go, the upcoming Switch spinoff game
4796000	4799000	that kind of combines the traditional Pokemon RPG
4799000	4803000	with some of the features from the Pokemon Go mobile game.
4803000	4806000	Apparently, there's going to be a big change when it comes to shinies,
4806000	4810000	because you will be able to see shinies on the map.
4810000	4815000	But it's not quite as easy as necessarily like, oh, there is a Pikachu
4815000	4818000	that is a slightly darker brownish type of color.
4818000	4821000	That's not quite how it works.
4821000	4825000	What it is is basically a shiny Pokemon doesn't look different
4825000	4827000	than other Pokemon in the overworld when it appears,
4827000	4832000	but a small glimmer, an aura, gives a player a chance to know
4832000	4835000	that the Pokemon they're looking at is shiny.
4835000	4840000	That is kind of a little hint maybe that this Pidgey is a little bit special.
4840000	4843000	It's got something that might be a little different.
4843000	4846000	Which, again, when it comes to shiny Pokemon, at least in most of the games,
4846000	4849000	especially in Go, it means literally nothing.
4849000	4851000	It's a different color. That's it.
4851000	4854000	It's a different color that's much more rare than the standard one.
4854000	4856000	So does it mean anything in the other games too?
4856000	4858000	Well, we don't know about Pokemon Let's Go.
4858000	4860000	Well, like in the other games.
4860000	4862000	No, not the new ones.
4862000	4866000	I think in the old Gen 2 or Gen 3, and chat, correct me if I'm wrong,
4866000	4870000	but I want to say there was something about the stats with shinies
4870000	4873000	would be a little bumped, but I don't think they continued that
4873000	4875000	in the more recent games.
4875000	4877000	That kind of went away.
4877000	4879000	So now it's just, oh, they're just a slightly different color,
4879000	4882000	and they're really rare, but that doesn't mean people don't obsess
4882000	4884000	about collecting them.
4884000	4886000	Obviously, we've all joked about our friend Shane,
4886000	4890000	who used to do the Pokestop podcast here at VOG Network.
4890000	4892000	He loves to collect shinies.
4892000	4894000	By the way, he does this in Go.
4894000	4896000	He collects shinies in Go. Why?
4896000	4898000	Because they're shiny.
4898000	4900000	When you trade people's shinies, do they stay shiny?
4900000	4903000	They stay shiny, but they won't keep the stats.
4903000	4906000	Just like any other Pokemon when you trade them.
4906000	4910000	And it can be very expensive to trade a shiny that you don't have
4910000	4913000	if you're not at least three-star friends with the other person.
4913000	4916000	If you're only at one star, it's a million stardust
4916000	4918000	to get a new shiny in your decks.
4918000	4920000	So, anyway.
4920000	4924000	Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
4924000	4926000	Let's see.
4927000	4930000	Oh, I guess there's still comments on the system.
4930000	4933000	They're having arguments about who makes the better chipsets in there.
4933000	4936000	So, Fifth Dream says,
4936000	4940000	it just tells what stats they have, but they're not even great stats.
4940000	4942000	So, SG100Matt says,
4942000	4945000	yep, gen one through three stats were better in the early games.
4945000	4947000	Now they're just color variants.
4947000	4949000	Yeah, that's what I kind of thought was the case there.
4949000	4953000	Anyway, November 16th, you can start to collect shinies and more
4953000	4955000	in Pokemon Let's Go.
4955000	4957000	I know I'm very much looking forward to that game.
4957000	4959000	Yeah, the game does look awesome.
4959000	4961000	I'm actually looking, I'm very excited for it.
4961000	4964000	I haven't really played any actual mainline Pokemon games,
4964000	4966000	so it'd be very interesting to check it out.
4966000	4967000	Yeah.
4967000	4969000	And what was it, we have like, I think,
4969000	4971000	I don't think we're talking about, but in a couple weeks,
4971000	4973000	I want to say that the rumor is
4973000	4976000	that there's going to be some sort of evolution fest in gen four in Pokemon Go.
4976000	4978000	Yeah, that rumor's been circulating for a bit.
4978000	4980000	I've been sock piling candy,
4980000	4982000	just because I don't want to
4982000	4984000	evolve this crap that I have.
4984000	4987000	Yeah, like an evolution event that would introduce some of the gen four Pokemon.
4987000	4990000	I know that's something, I know there's a lot of rumors about PvP,
4990000	4993000	because I guess something came out of one of the Ingress events
4993000	4995000	that happened last weekend.
4995000	4998000	There was an interview with a Niantic representative at the Poland event.
4998000	5000000	Warsaw was one of the sites for an anomaly.
5000000	5003000	And there was an interview with a Niantic rep there who said,
5003000	5006000	basically flat out, that they're trying to get PvP done this year.
5006000	5009000	So that's something, that's like the next big thing for Pokemon Go.
5009000	5013000	But it's with every gen that's hit the game,
5013000	5016000	something huge hit with it.
5016000	5019000	Like gen three gave us the weather boosting.
5019000	5022000	Gen two was, was that the gym redesign?
5022000	5024000	Would gen two hit?
5024000	5026000	I think so. So maybe gen four is going to be PvP.
5026000	5028000	I don't know. So we'll see.
5028000	5030000	I mean, the friends list was already kind of a big
5030000	5032000	frickin' change to the game.
5032000	5034000	And the gifting and all that stuff.
5034000	5036000	So I don't know. Alright.
5036000	5040000	Anyhow, let's go to a more classic time in gaming.
5042000	5044000	When you couldn't collect any shinies, they didn't exist.
5044000	5047000	It's the classic peripheral of the month, because once a month,
5047000	5050000	Dark Sakura mixes it up a bit and not only says,
5050000	5052000	here's a game that you should be checking out,
5052000	5056000	but hey, here's a little peripheral, something that helps you play games,
5056000	5058000	that you may have never heard of.
5058000	5060000	And this one is, yeah, very much...
5060000	5062000	It's not even playing a game, really.
5062000	5064000	Yeah, this is an interesting one you picked this month,
5064000	5066000	but I like it. What is the classic peripheral of the month?
5066000	5069000	I picked, as it was known in the US,
5069000	5071000	the Singer Isaac sewing machine.
5071000	5073000	For Game Boy.
5073000	5076000	Yes. For Game Boy.
5076000	5080000	In Japan, it was released as the Jaguar JN 100,
5080000	5084000	which was about $600 when it was released.
5084000	5086000	Um...
5086000	5089000	It, um, I just picked general Game Boy games.
5089000	5091000	Game Boy music? That's fine.
5091000	5094000	So anyway, it was a sewing machine
5094000	5098000	that would hook up to a Game Boy cartridge
5098000	5102000	that was called Rakuraku machine,
5102000	5104000	which is sewing machine, is what it was called.
5104000	5106000	We actually got this in the US,
5106000	5109000	because they marketed this in the US
5109000	5112000	as the Singer Isaac for Game Boy.
5112000	5116000	There's sites that are selling them for about $400.
5117000	5122000	You can get a full Jaguar Nintendo sewing machine
5122000	5126000	for $1400 on eBay, by the way.
5126000	5130000	I just happened to double check a finished auction on it.
5130000	5134000	But anyway, with the Game Rakuraku machine,
5134000	5136000	it had different embroidery patterns
5136000	5138000	that you could create on there,
5138000	5140000	and then you would save them,
5140000	5142000	plug the cartridge in on the sewing machine,
5142000	5145000	and it would do the embroidery for you.
5145000	5148000	And as this, you know, kept going,
5148000	5152000	they actually did other versions of this machine in Japan.
5152000	5155000	Now, of course, we got the one, the Isaac,
5155000	5158000	but the other ones that came out overseas
5158000	5160000	were different models.
5160000	5163000	There was the JN-2000.
5163000	5165000	It had an improved model that used
5165000	5167000	a different external embroidery attachment,
5167000	5170000	and it was very quick.
5170000	5172000	There were other games that came out
5172000	5177000	that would use this embroidery attachment,
5177000	5180000	including one called Mario Family,
5180000	5185000	which was a game where it had just different Mario...
5185000	5188000	I would probably say Mario World era,
5188000	5190000	because it was Game Boy Color stuff,
5190000	5196000	that would let you do different kinds of embroidery patterns.
5196000	5199000	They tested a Kirby one.
5199000	5203000	There is video of it in use on the Kirby one.
5203000	5208000	They only showed it at one of the consumer electronic shows in Japan.
5208000	5214000	The other thing, too, is that this machine would also do text.
5214000	5219000	It would do kanji, I think, up to 500 characters.
5219000	5223000	Hiragana, katakana, and romaji, which is English letters.
5224000	5229000	And then, of course, there were no follow-ups past that.
5229000	5234000	It was pretty popular with some of the niche market.
5234000	5236000	In the US, people were like,
5236000	5238000	oh, this is cool, this is cool,
5238000	5241000	but there wasn't just enough interest in it.
5241000	5244000	Which, by the way, that was also, I think,
5244000	5247000	the same year that at one of the US electronic shows,
5247000	5256000	they did the knitting machine that Howard Phillips actually showed being used.
5256000	5259000	That was only just that prototype.
5259000	5264000	But yeah, it was, it's an interesting idea.
5264000	5266000	It's really neat.
5266000	5268000	I mean, the Singer Isaac machines,
5268000	5270000	the thing about it is that,
5270000	5273000	keep in mind that this release came out around the time that like,
5273000	5276000	all those colorful IMAX were out, right?
5276000	5278000	With all the various colors.
5278000	5280000	These Isaac machines were no different.
5280000	5283000	It had that same kind of aqua blue color.
5283000	5287000	And, you know, that matched one of the Game Boy colors.
5287000	5289000	But there were other rakaraku sewing machines.
5289000	5293000	One of them, not sewing machines, the machine, but the game.
5293000	5296000	There was an embroidery one,
5296000	5301000	and then there was another one that was sort of like a stitch embellishment one.
5301000	5304000	So yeah, there were a total of four, quote,
5304000	5309000	game cartridges that were released to be used with the sewing machine.
5309000	5313000	And I know it's not technically a peripheral,
5313000	5319000	but it is a piece of gaming history and something that's meant to work with it.
5319000	5325000	For example, the Jaguar release that came out in Japan
5325000	5328000	actually had a little docking station for a Game Boy
5328000	5332000	that you would plug it directly into the Game Boy while it had the game running on it.
5332000	5334000	And then with the embroidery attachment.
5334000	5337000	So, it's pretty neat.
5337000	5342000	I wouldn't, you know, I'd be lying if I said I didn't want one.
5342000	5344000	I would like one.
5344000	5348000	But, again, I don't have 1,400 bucks for it.
5348000	5353000	So, there you go. That's your peripheral of the month.
5353000	5356000	And, of course, you can imagine not a lot of people really know about this,
5356000	5358000	or they're hearing about this for the first time.
5358000	5360000	So, some comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
5360000	5362000	I'll find a picture of it for everyone.
5362000	5364000	SJ100Matt says, I did not know this existed.
5364000	5367000	Looking at it now, it's pretty impressive that the Game Boy Color could handle this.
5367000	5369000	Yeah, so that's kind of neat.
5369000	5372000	I put a link to one of the articles I got my information from,
5372000	5374000	so you can see the US one.
5374000	5375000	Yeah.
5375000	5379000	It's pretty neat. The Jaguar one is all red.
5379000	5384000	And then I actually found a place that's selling them.
5384000	5387000	So, if anyone wants one that has 400 bucks for it,
5387000	5391000	and is going to be selfish to not buy me one, I'll link it for you.
5391000	5395000	All right. Well, there it is, your classic peripheral of the month.
5395000	5397000	We are going to take a break, but when we come back,
5397000	5399000	there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come,
5399000	5401000	including some more rapid-fire news.
5401000	5403000	We're going to get into release dates as well,
5403000	5407000	and your calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype,
5407000	5412000	when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5418000	5421000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio,
5421000	5427000	live with our 740th episode already in progress for tonight, August 5th, 2018,
5427000	5429000	taping live as we always do at the Voice of Geeks Network,
5429000	5431000	where we just got back from a little music break.
5431000	5434000	And I can't help but read some of the chat happening during the music break.
5434000	5436000	So, Bobby shared a link with you about Animal Crossing.
5436000	5439000	I am putting this actually on my fan page.
5439000	5441000	Yeah? What is this?
5441000	5443000	How grammar works in Animal Crossing, apparently.
5443000	5445000	So, it does grade you on grammar?
5445000	5447000	Yeah, it has, like, certain – they're very simple rules,
5447000	5452000	but, like, you have to, like, whenever you put in a punctuation mark,
5452000	5455000	like a period or exclamation or, you know,
5455000	5459000	you have to use a capital letter within three characters after.
5459000	5462000	So, it counts for doing the double space after a period.
5462000	5464000	Oh, so it lets you do either way.
5464000	5465000	Yeah.
5465000	5468000	Why would it let you do the wrong way? I'm just kidding.
5468000	5472000	So, I can write, you know, Bob – Bobra and say, like,
5472000	5474000	you are the most smartest person in the village.
5474000	5476000	The person did a period space, a period space,
5476000	5478000	just nothing but a letter full of it.
5478000	5481000	But if you do, like, I think more than 75 characters
5481000	5485000	without any capital letters or punctuation,
5485000	5488000	you get scored down 150 points.
5488000	5489000	Wow.
5489000	5490000	Yeah, so –
5490000	5491000	Interesting.
5491000	5493000	It's really cool. I'm going to post it up on my fan page.
5493000	5496000	Okay. That's – who knew?
5496000	5500000	Still wish Nintendo would announce a new Animal Crossing game already,
5500000	5502000	but I suppose nothing else yet.
5502000	5504000	We'll see what they are announcing around the gaming world
5504000	5506000	as we quickly look at some rapid fire news.
5506000	5507000	Loki.
5507000	5508000	All right.
5508000	5513000	So, we talked about last week what the Xbox Games with Gold lineup is,
5513000	5518000	and now it's time for the PlayStation Plus free games for August.
5518000	5520000	So, starting off from PlayStation 4,
5520000	5523000	we have Mafia III and Dead by Daylight.
5523000	5528000	On PlayStation 3, Bound by Flame and Serious Sam III BFE.
5529000	5534000	And finally, on PlayStation Vita, Draw Slasher and Space Hulk.
5534000	5536000	So, those are your free games.
5536000	5538000	Mafia III looks pretty cool. I'll have to check that out.
5538000	5540000	But neat.
5540000	5543000	And then a game I've been looking forward to
5543000	5545000	and finally is going to be coming out.
5545000	5547000	Unfortunately, someone –
5547000	5549000	I know that we had a story a few weeks ago
5549000	5554000	about how an iOS publisher had ripped it off
5554000	5556000	and made a clone game out of it,
5556000	5560000	but Donut Country is a game that's going to be coming out to PlayStation 4
5560000	5563000	and PC and iOS on August 28th.
5563000	5565000	For those not familiar with it,
5565000	5569000	it is kind of like a katamari game.
5569000	5571000	It's a little bit of a reverse katamari.
5571000	5574000	Basically, you control a hole that gets bigger as you drop things into it.
5574000	5577000	And so, as you drop, you start with smaller things and then larger things,
5577000	5579000	and you solve puzzles doing that and stuff.
5579000	5583000	And it's got a funny little raccoon that's like the main character in the game.
5583000	5585000	Trash panda.
5585000	5587000	Definitely worth checking out.
5587000	5589000	I'm very excited to play this.
5589000	5592000	I've been looking forward to it ever since I saw the first trailer for it.
5592000	5594000	I'll play Trash Panda the game.
5594000	5597000	I do wish Namco would make a new katamari damashi game already.
5597000	5599000	This is not mobile.
5599000	5601000	Not the katamari tapping game and that crap.
5601000	5603000	I want a legit new game.
5603000	5605000	But one thing that Namco is doing
5605000	5607000	is that they're putting out Donkey – excuse me,
5607000	5610000	they're not putting that out, but they're putting out Taiku no Tatsujin
5610000	5612000	out here in the west as well as Europe.
5612000	5614000	But apparently it's going to be digital only,
5614000	5616000	both places, even though there was box art floating around out there.
5616000	5618000	It's going to be digital only, both places after all.
5618000	5622000	They're not releasing the actual taiko drum,
5622000	5624000	which, in my opinion,
5624000	5627000	completely fucking defeats the purpose of Taiku no Tatsujin.
5627000	5630000	But all right, I suppose there's some people that will play button button mode.
5630000	5634000	But you can, on the Nintendo Switch, use Donkey Konga bongos.
5634000	5637000	That's why I started to say donkey, because the story is about that.
5637000	5640000	If you actually use the GameCube adapter with your Switch,
5640000	5642000	you can plug in Donkey Konga bongos,
5642000	5644000	and you can play Taiku no Tatsujin with that,
5644000	5649000	if, you know, you have Donkey Konga bongos still sitting around somewhere.
5649000	5651000	Good luck with that.
5651000	5654000	I mean, I guess maybe you could still find them at a thrift store.
5654000	5656000	Yeah, eBay or a thrift store or something.
5656000	5658000	Locally, you know, was it like Dimple?
5658000	5661000	Man, if you want anything retro game, everything.
5661000	5667000	But I do think it's a bonehead move to at least let a special order or something.
5667000	5671000	At least do, like, an Amazon or, you know, a store.
5671000	5672000	Play Asia.
5672000	5677000	Well, not even, like, just like some type of, like, US release or something.
5677000	5679000	Like, it would be really nice if Namco would support that,
5679000	5682000	because I kind of think they're just setting this game up to fail otherwise.
5682000	5686000	So, which is a bummer for all the Taiku no Tatsujin fans out there.
5686000	5689000	But I guess there's some people that'll tap the screen or use their buttons,
5689000	5692000	but it's just, it's not the same thing.
5692000	5702000	Anyway, Beatmania 2DX still trucking along after all these years with the location test of 26th style,
5702000	5705000	although they stopped calling them my numbers a long time ago.
5705000	5712000	This particular version is called Beatmania 2DX Rootage is the name of it.
5712000	5717000	Rootage, if you want to be fancy. R-O-O-T-A-G-E, Rootage.
5717000	5721000	Well, Rootage, that just makes me think of watching all those Guy Tang videos.
5721000	5722000	Yeah.
5722000	5726000	With him talking about, we're going to do a Chateau Root on her Rootage.
5726000	5729000	So, the location test happened this past weekend.
5729000	5734000	Our pals at Bimani Style have a nice little write-up on it if you want to see some of the artwork from the game and so forth.
5734000	5737000	It looks like they might be, like, making the How to Play stickers general,
5737000	5740000	so they don't have to keep updating it with every release and stuff.
5740000	5743000	They might be making some changes to how high speed works.
5743000	5745000	There's apparently 10 different high speed settings now,
5745000	5749000	and it all scrolls the same regardless of the song's BPM.
5749000	5754000	So, that's kind of neat, although it does point out the BPM changes will still happen within a song.
5754000	5758000	You can also do playlists through QR codes, kind of interesting.
5758000	5763000	But, other things that I thought was very interesting is that I was looking at the song list,
5763000	5767000	and, you know, it's a lot of stuff I don't follow as much as I used to,
5767000	5769000	although some of the artists are still there after all these years.
5769000	5774000	Kors K, still there. A new song called Wonderland, and so forth.
5774000	5782000	But I thought this was interesting is that Porter Robinson has a song in Beat Media 2DX Rootage, or 26.
5782000	5787000	It's under his alias that he puts music out under now called Virtual Self,
5787000	5789000	and the song is called Particle Arts.
5789000	5793000	So, if you've listened to that EP on Spotify or what have you,
5793000	5795000	that song is actually going to be in Beat Media 2DX,
5795000	5800000	and he actually tweeted about that on his account, Virtual Self, the song in the game, so that's there.
5800000	5806000	I think that's kind of notable because Porter Robinson was kind of known for, or is kind of known for,
5806000	5811000	he has directly cited Bamani music as some of his influence as being a DJ.
5811000	5816000	He's the one that will drop Look to the Sky and shit in the middle of his DJing and stuff when he does those things.
5816000	5820000	I think he just did a big gig at Vegas, I think it was a big electronic festival in Vegas a couple weeks ago,
5820000	5826000	because I think our pal DNL was there, so I think she was posting stuff from his set and stuff.
5826000	5830000	So anyway, it's kind of interesting how that's come full circle,
5830000	5836000	is that stuff like Beat Media and Bamani influenced this guy, he's a young guy, he's only in his early 20s,
5836000	5843000	influenced him and now he is influencing future Beat Media games by having one of his songs in it.
5843000	5848000	So, if you want to hear the song, it's on Spotify, Apple Music, all those places.
5848000	5853000	Again, Porter Robinson now kind of goes by Virtual Self, he's one of those musical artists that changes his name,
5853000	5859000	and the song is called Particle Arts, if you want a little preview of what that will sound like on the soundtrack.
5859000	5863000	So, that's it for me, DarkSakura, what do you have for Rapid Fire News?
5863000	5869000	Some stuff. Basically, the Nintendo Switch for the June 2018 report,
5869000	5879000	actually is the only system that had software sales that increased over that particular quarter,
5879000	5885000	but that's not all, the NES Classic was the number one best-selling hardware.
5885000	5891000	So, they beat out the PS4. Suck it, Sony!
5891000	5903000	So, the NES Classic sold more than the PS4. Funny how those things can sell when you actually put them on shelves.
5903000	5905000	Funny how that works, right, Logie?
5905000	5911000	Yeah, it is funny how that works. It makes sense, though, because it was unavailable for the longest time,
5911000	5916000	and then now, I don't think there was any really big games coming out in June.
5916000	5922000	No, it's been a slow month for console, but still, you have to appreciate the novelty of,
5922000	5930000	here we are in the year 2018, and the best-selling gaming system of last month was the Nintendo Entertainment System.
5930000	5933000	People were worried they weren't going to be able to get it. They thought it was going to be limited.
5933000	5934000	Guilty!
5934000	5942000	Anyway, in other news, Mario Kart 4 Wii is showing up on Nvidia Shield in China,
5942000	5948000	which is basically how they get pretty much any Nintendo game, is it has to show up on Nvidia Shield.
5948000	5953000	That's how they got all the N64 titles that came out of there.
5953000	5956000	Yeah, Nvidia has some agreement with Nintendo, but it's like for China.
5957000	5963000	Yeah, because I saw someone, maybe a Eurogamer, looking at the emulator with it and stuff,
5963000	5969000	and saying that it's upresing some of the textures, or upresing the geometry, but not the texture.
5969000	5974000	I don't know, something like that. But it's like its own unique emulator that's running the stuff,
5974000	5978000	because they have, Mario Galaxy was one of the games that was on there.
5978000	5980000	Yeah, that's it.
5980000	5983000	I think they might be editing some of the games, too, because I thought I heard that...
5983000	5984000	Well, they have to.
5984000	5991000	Well, not like... Well, yeah. Is China the country where you can't show skeletons,
5991000	5995000	where they had to change the undead in World of Warcraft because you can't show skeletons?
5995000	5997000	I don't know.
5997000	5998000	Was it zombies?
5998000	6002000	Well, because I'm thinking of Dry Bones, the turtle. Wasn't he a playable...
6002000	6004000	But there's other things that they have to edit out, too.
6004000	6009000	Well, and not just that, but I was thinking more like the multiplayer, I believe they had called out,
6009000	6013000	which is not going to be in the Mario Kart Wii. They removed it, basically.
6013000	6018000	Sorry, online multiplayer specifically. Obviously, in the same room is what Mario Kart's known for.
6018000	6022000	That's still there. But the online multiplayer has been removed.
6022000	6024000	So, interesting.
6024000	6026000	I mean, it makes sense, but...
6026000	6034000	I think the thought that it's running on a Tegra-based console is that,
6034000	6043000	Hey, Nintendo has a Tegra-based console. Could we possibly get some of this shit on the Switch, please?
6043000	6046000	Hmm. Hey.
6046000	6047000	The plot thickens.
6047000	6048000	But, no. Probably not.
6048000	6053000	All right. Well, let's talk about some things that are coming out a little sooner than Virtual Console,
6053000	6057000	or whatever Nintendo's doing next. It's release dates. What's coming out this week?
6057000	6061000	Yeah, I was going to talk about releasing the game that I was working on,
6061000	6064000	and talk about lowering the bars for expectations and stuff.
6064000	6068000	Even lower than what we would expect for the Virtual Console stuff.
6068000	6071000	But anyways, this week we've got a few things.
6071000	6079000	So, starting off on PC, Mac and Linux, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6079000	6083000	We have Dead Cells, which is a roguelike Metroidvania game.
6083000	6088000	Flipping Death on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6088000	6093000	Overcooked 2 on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6093000	6098000	Layton's Mystery Journey DX on a Nintendo Switch.
6098000	6102000	I didn't even realize there was a Professor Layton game coming to the Switch.
6102000	6107000	Minute, which is pretty awesome looking, and that's also coming to the Switch.
6107000	6114000	Monster Hunter World on PC, Okami HD on the Nintendo Switch, Yakuza 3,
6114000	6118000	I'm assuming the remaster on PlayStation 4.
6118000	6126000	And then we've got Football, Madden NFL 19 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6126000	6128000	No one buys that stuff.
6128000	6134000	And finally, I guess coming out of Early Access, We Happy Few on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6134000	6138000	It feels early for Madden to be released, but I guess August is the month.
6138000	6140000	It is August. I guess so.
6140000	6143000	They used to tend towards the end of the month, but...
6143000	6145000	Maybe they want to get the kids before they're back in school.
6145000	6147000	Or, well, shit, kids are going back to school next week.
6147000	6150000	It feels like they go back earlier and earlier.
6150000	6152000	So, wow.
6152000	6155000	Well, anyhow, let's go to Japan and talk about what's coming out there.
6155000	6158000	On the PlayStation 4 in Japan this week, Bullet Girls Fantasia.
6158000	6161000	If you want to check that out from D3, that's out this week on PS4.
6161000	6165000	Darkest Dungeon, as well as Fire Pro Wrestling World.
6165000	6168000	Jake Hunter Detective Story, Prism of Eyes.
6168000	6171000	That Bullet Girls Fantasia also has a limited edition version.
6171000	6175000	There's a remaster of Ryu Ga Gotoku 3.
6175000	6177000	And there is...
6177000	6178000	Oh, that's it.
6178000	6181000	Because the rest I'm looking at is for the next week after that.
6181000	6183000	So that's what you have on the Vita this week.
6183000	6188000	Looking at the Nintendo Switch, some of those same games are also out on the Switch, including Darkest Dungeon.
6188000	6190000	Jake Hunter Detective Story, Prism of Eyes.
6190000	6194000	The Layton's Mysterious Journey, that is also out in Japan this week.
6194000	6196000	That same one that Loki referenced.
6196000	6198000	Also out in Japan this week on the Switch.
6198000	6199000	Okami.
6199000	6203000	So the Switch port of Okami is out this week, so that's pretty cool.
6203000	6205000	And then Waku Waku Sweets.
6205000	6211000	My Okashi Ga Dekiru Kana comes out this week on the Switch.
6211000	6213000	And I'm trying to see if this is something I would recognize.
6213000	6216000	Because it's from a company called Sonic Power.
6216000	6218000	But no, sadly it has something to do with Sonic the Hedgehog.
6218000	6220000	It's happy sweets making.
6220000	6223000	It's basically, let's learn how to make a cake.
6223000	6225000	Is basically what it is.
6225000	6227000	Go bake me a cake.
6227000	6229000	Yeah, go bake me a cake.
6229000	6234000	But it has this cute, look at this cute little doggy that wears a necklace made out of strawberries with this big pink bow.
6234000	6239000	And I just want to take that cute little puppy and say, go make me a cake, bitch.
6239000	6241000	I can say that because it's a dog.
6241000	6243000	Only because it's a female dog.
6243000	6245000	This reminds me of Cooking Mama.
6245000	6250000	And Cooking Mama, let's be fair, I know Waluigi is really a big contender for Smash.
6250000	6253000	But Cooking Mama should really be a character in Smash.
6253000	6257000	Loki, you still don't want to hear about this, but I saw the most amazing tweet this week.
6257000	6263000	It was a guy dressed up as Waluigi, but it was completely in leather gear.
6263000	6272000	So he was wearing a Waluigi leather hat and little leather and showing off the chest and all that stuff.
6272000	6274000	Guys that are in the leather do.
6274000	6276000	And I was just like, that's art.
6279000	6280000	Alternative costume.
6280000	6283000	I think it was actually a bearded drag performer who did it.
6283000	6286000	I think it was, I'll find it in our soccer so you can see it.
6286000	6290000	This is something I can see one of your buddies here locally doing.
6290000	6294000	So anyway, but first UK releases while I try to find that.
6294000	6301000	Overcooked 2 comes out on August 7th for PlayStation 4, Xbone, and Switch.
6301000	6307000	On the PC we have Quake Champion Scale Bearer Edition on August 9th.
6307000	6313000	And then on the 10th we have Madden 19, who gives a shit.
6313000	6318000	And We Happy Few for several different systems.
6318000	6320000	And that is it.
6320000	6322000	I have to see the leather daddy.
6322000	6325000	Helvetica is the name of the queen that did that.
6325000	6326000	Girl.
6326000	6329000	But a bearded drag performer, so.
6329000	6330000	Some of that's photoshopped.
6330000	6331000	You think?
6331000	6332000	I think it is.
6332000	6333000	I don't know.
6333000	6334000	The eyeshadow looks legit.
6334000	6335000	The nose.
6335000	6336000	I think the nose is legit.
6336000	6337000	I think that's photoshopped.
6337000	6338000	It is?
6338000	6339000	Alright, maybe.
6339000	6341000	Unless he's got some really good pigment.
6341000	6342000	I still laughed.
6342000	6343000	That cracked me up.
6343000	6344000	Alright.
6344000	6345000	Anyway.
6345000	6350000	Honestly it's the little mustache coming right out of his nostril that looks like it's painted
6350000	6351000	on in Photoshop.
6351000	6352000	Akuma Wants A Link.
6352000	6354000	I figured some of you would want this.
6354000	6356000	It's Helvetica Queen.
6356000	6358000	But it's not spelled the way you would think.
6358000	6359000	It's not spelled like the font.
6359000	6363000	H-E-L-L-V-E-T-I-K-A.
6363000	6364000	Queen.
6364000	6368000	And then it would be on their Twitter feed if you want to see that.
6368000	6369000	Alright.
6369000	6372000	Anyhow, I can't believe I just gave out that tweet on there.
6372000	6373000	Alright.
6373000	6375000	I thought it was.
6375000	6377000	I was like, that's a good idea.
6377000	6378000	That was well done.
6378000	6379000	Alright, anyway.
6379000	6381000	Let's get to the mailbag.
6381000	6383000	Every week you guys send us emails.
6383000	6386000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6386000	6388000	Although I don't remember if we got any this week.
6388000	6390000	But I suppose our soccer's gonna tell me in a minute here.
6390000	6394000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is where you send emails and we read them here on error,
6394000	6396000	which we're gonna do right now.
6396000	6397000	One.
6397000	6398000	Uno.
6398000	6402000	Rob, I was watching your stream this week of No Man's Sky.
6402000	6405000	I know you'll probably mention it in your gaming week.
6405000	6408000	I was curious to know what you think of the update.
6408000	6411000	Is it something you will continue to play?
6411000	6414000	Also, I was wondering about the multiplayer.
6414000	6416000	I know you can have up to four people in your game,
6416000	6420000	but I can't understand what the point is in naming a creature that you discover
6420000	6424000	or making your base discoverable for other players when it seems to be invite only.
6424000	6425000	I'm gonna jump in.
6425000	6428000	Awkward, but I think we actually did do this one last week.
6428000	6429000	Oh, okay.
6429000	6430000	I seem to remember responding to it, but it was after you.
6430000	6432000	Then delete the mail.
6432000	6435000	I checked the date.
6435000	6437000	He's getting rusty in his old age.
6437000	6438000	I do.
6438000	6439000	Here's the thing.
6439000	6440000	I'm spoiled.
6440000	6442000	Cursing on Bobby's show.
6442000	6446000	Remember when we had major problems with the emails
6446000	6448000	and we weren't able to log into the mailbag?
6448000	6451000	I had them all forwarded to my personal account,
6451000	6453000	and I just never turned that off,
6453000	6455000	so I just read them from my personal account.
6455000	6457000	Sorry, Jamie.
6457000	6460000	Well, now the box is empty.
6460000	6464000	I've even moved that Street Fighter IV code into another folder.
6464000	6465000	Fair enough.
6465000	6469000	DarkSakura's cleaning up the mess in the inbox.
6469000	6470000	I'm always cleaning up after.
6470000	6473000	What is it that we threaten to do if the box is empty?
6473000	6474000	I forget what we were gonna be talking about.
6474000	6475000	Something that was really...
6475000	6476000	We were gonna email each other?
6476000	6478000	Oh, yeah, there was something we were gonna talk about
6478000	6480000	that was gonna be really offensive.
6480000	6481000	I don't remember what it was.
6481000	6483000	It wasn't offensive to your senses, basically.
6483000	6485000	What is the most offensive thing?
6485000	6487000	I'll just let DarkSakura talk about it.
6487000	6488000	You know what?
6488000	6489000	Dick cheese.
6489000	6490000	Okay, no, no, no, no.
6490000	6491000	Here it is.
6491000	6492000	Dick cheese is pretty offensive, though.
6492000	6494000	Official punishment to the listeners.
6494000	6496000	As punishment for not emailing us in the past week,
6496000	6498000	I am going to ask DarkSakura more information
6498000	6499000	about her trip to the Bolt.
6499000	6502000	So tell me more about your trip to the Leather Daddy Bar.
6502000	6505000	Actually, my trip to the Bolt was really otherwise uneventful.
6505000	6508000	No, but I ordered a Lynchburg lemonade.
6508000	6509000	Okay.
6509000	6510000	And they didn't have lemonade,
6510000	6513000	so they made it out of sour mix and triple sec.
6513000	6516000	So I was toasty by that point,
6516000	6519000	so I decided to get in the leather harness swing
6519000	6522000	and sit in it like it was a toddler swing
6522000	6526000	and swing back and forth on stage at the Bolt.
6527000	6530000	And then I got a picture of one of the other sisters
6530000	6533000	with her legs spread way out up on the chain,
6533000	6535000	because you know what the harness looks like.
6535000	6536000	Have you been to the Bolt?
6536000	6537000	Yeah, I've seen it.
6537000	6539000	I haven't been in it, but I've seen it.
6539000	6542000	It's a four-chain leather harness
6542000	6544000	that's got a big leather seat in the middle.
6544000	6546000	And so I was sitting on there swinging
6546000	6548000	like I was in grade school,
6548000	6551000	and then I got down and then we went in the back seat
6551000	6553000	and I saw chickens fucking.
6553000	6555000	At least it looked like it.
6555000	6557000	The chickens, okay, I think they were all,
6557000	6559000	there were chickens in the backyard.
6559000	6561000	It's been a while since I've been in the bars,
6561000	6563000	but I don't remember any of this stuff.
6563000	6564000	This is the Bolt.
6564000	6566000	This is the CE bar close to the suburbs.
6566000	6568000	It's the leather bar, but it has a backyard.
6568000	6570000	And I don't think chickens actually-
6570000	6571000	It's actually fine.
6571000	6573000	It's not as scandalous as she makes it sound.
6573000	6575000	But they were these different hens
6575000	6577000	that seemed like they were all just humping each other
6577000	6578000	for some reason.
6578000	6580000	And I'm like, what the fuck are you chickens doing?
6580000	6582000	And then apparently there's rabbits back there too,
6582000	6583000	but I know about that.
6583000	6586000	And then I went back in and watched more gay porn.
6586000	6588000	All right, there you go, listeners.
6588000	6591000	Your punishment for not sending us any emails this week.
6591000	6593000	For the record.
6593000	6595000	And if you continue to not email us,
6595000	6597000	we will have more stories from Dark Soccer's weekends.
6597000	6599000	For the record, bottoms Y.
6601000	6603000	Now I know why-
6603000	6605000	Enough, enough punishment, enough.
6605000	6607000	Save it for next week, just in case.
6607000	6609000	All right, let's get to some more video.
6609000	6611000	If you haven't already turned off the show,
6611000	6614000	let's get to some more video game news, Loki.
6614000	6616000	My freaking ears!
6616000	6618000	Uh, so let's talk a little.
6618000	6622000	This is almost as offensive as what we were just listening to.
6622000	6626000	Um, microtransactions in Gran Turismo Sport.
6626000	6628000	They promised.
6628000	6631000	They said, hey, we're not gonna put microtransactions in this game.
6631000	6634000	And then sure enough, with the July update for Gran Turismo Sport,
6634000	6638000	it added new tracks, more cars, oh, and microtransactions.
6638000	6640000	They said that they weren't gonna do it.
6640000	6642000	Um, so basically,
6642000	6645000	um, you can purchase cars outright,
6645000	6647000	as long as, I guess,
6647000	6650000	they're less than two million in in-game currency.
6650000	6652000	Um, apparently,
6652000	6654000	what's gonna change is that,
6654000	6657000	um, for now, I guess you're gonna be able to buy cars,
6657000	6659000	I guess, for real money, too.
6659000	6661000	So they're listing them for, like, three bucks
6661000	6664000	in, uh, the PlayStation Store.
6665000	6667000	If you don't wanna grind for,
6667000	6669000	you know, I guess the Alpine Vision.
6669000	6671000	Gran Turismo 2017.
6672000	6674000	Um...
6675000	6677000	I don't know.
6677000	6679000	I'm not surprised anymore, you know what?
6679000	6682000	It's just the way this stuff is going.
6682000	6684000	Gotta make all of the money.
6685000	6687000	If you're willing to pay it,
6687000	6689000	they're willing to sell it.
6689000	6691000	But it's kinda lame, like,
6691000	6694000	maybe even a little bit disingenuous that they
6694000	6696000	promise that they're not gonna do it.
6696000	6698000	They sell you the copy of the game,
6698000	6700000	patch it in later, and it's like...
6700000	6701000	Welp.
6701000	6702000	Yeah, that's a little...
6702000	6704000	Too fucking bad for you. You already paid it.
6704000	6706000	You know, paid the money.
6706000	6708000	It's like, you know...
6708000	6709000	But there's excuses gonna be,
6709000	6711000	oh, we're giving player choice,
6711000	6712000	or something like this.
6712000	6714000	You don't have to grind in-game.
6714000	6715000	You can...
6715000	6717000	Our game isn't worth grinding in.
6717000	6719000	Spend the money to not play the game.
6719000	6720000	That never made any sense to me.
6720000	6721000	Especially way after the fact.
6721000	6723000	It makes you, like, not even wanna connect your game online
6723000	6725000	to get these types of patches, you know what I mean?
6725000	6727000	It's just like, you know, the other games, too.
6727000	6730000	Shadow of War, where they, like, had the microtransactions in there,
6730000	6732000	and the room, the balancing of the game.
6732000	6735000	And then, like, months later, after nobody's using that shit anymore,
6735000	6736000	then they're like,
6736000	6740000	oh, we're doing the good thing and taking it out.
6740000	6742000	Look how awesome we are.
6742000	6743000	See, we listen.
6743000	6745000	We listen to you, consumer.
6745000	6746000	Alright, real quick, before we move on,
6746000	6748000	Bobby's being that guy in chat,
6748000	6751000	saying, Devil's Advocate, the price of the cars doesn't change.
6751000	6755000	So, I guess you can still get them the old way, if you want.
6755000	6759000	Right, but it's the fact that they're offering that in the first place,
6759000	6760000	as an incentive.
6760000	6762000	They're making the grind.
6762000	6764000	I'm assuming the grind is diff-
6764000	6765000	It is a grind.
6765000	6767000	If it was easy, then it wouldn't be an incentive.
6767000	6768000	It's basically an unlock code.
6768000	6770000	DJ Max did the same thing not that long ago.
6770000	6772000	They put out a thing that you can download to, like,
6772000	6774000	just basically unlock all of the songs.
6774000	6775000	Anyway.
6775000	6779000	Just wanna say, um, it was announced in chat.
6779000	6781000	Thank you, SSJ100Matt.
6781000	6785000	SonicFox just won the Dragon Ball FighterZ championship.
6785000	6787000	First suit and all.
6787000	6789000	We have a victor who is a furry.
6789000	6791000	Okay, fun. Work.
6791000	6792000	I watched him play.
6792000	6794000	I think he was the Ten Shinhan player.
6794000	6796000	I saw an interview with him somewhere, so.
6796000	6797000	Pretty, pretty crazy.
6797000	6799000	Props to them, but my god, that's gotta be fucking hot.
6799000	6800000	That's gotta be so hot.
6800000	6801000	I know, that's the only thing.
6801000	6804000	Like, I don't even think about the things that people say about, like,
6804000	6805000	furries and that and all this.
6805000	6806000	Like, I don't even care.
6806000	6809000	Like, I'm just like, that guy's gotta be fucking sweating in there.
6809000	6811000	Maybe he's got fans and all that stuff. I don't know.
6811000	6813000	No, not this. This first suit doesn't.
6813000	6816000	I mean, it looks like his first suit is really just, like,
6816000	6819000	the arm pieces and the thing.
6819000	6823000	But he was, when I watched him play last night, he was, um,
6823000	6826000	just wearing a furry hat.
6826000	6828000	Not the full suit.
6828000	6830000	Okay, I mean, that's just.
6830000	6832000	I can imagine, like, if they have some sort of stage lighting,
6832000	6834000	so that shit's gotta be fucking cooking.
6834000	6837000	SSJ100Matt says he only wore the head after the match has ended.
6837000	6838000	Okay, that's a little better.
6838000	6839000	Okay, we'll do that.
6839000	6840000	But still.
6840000	6841000	Yeah.
6841000	6843000	Still, I'm like, oh my god, I'd pass out.
6843000	6844000	Alright, anyway.
6844000	6846000	Uh, thank you for the update.
6846000	6848000	Uh, another update for you guys.
6848000	6851000	I don't know if anyone's using Gamefly, the streaming.
6851000	6853000	Weren't they? Didn't they used to be a mail order service?
6853000	6854000	Yeah.
6854000	6856000	Well, they switched to streaming some time ago,
6856000	6858000	so they're, like, a streaming only service, and.
6858000	6860000	I didn't know they had streaming.
6860000	6864000	Yeah, they kind of shifted to that, and now they're gonna be gone gone.
6864000	6868000	Uh, because Gamefly, uh, got acquired by EA, so.
6868000	6870000	Well, well, throw in the towel.
6870000	6872000	They're gonna consume yet another country.
6872000	6875000	Hey, this time they're even going outside of game developers.
6875000	6878000	Hey, fuck it. We're gonna eat in this company now.
6878000	6879000	It's, uh, it's, uh.
6879000	6880000	Gotta feed the devil.
6880000	6883000	The Grim Reaper's just pointing, just sign here.
6883000	6886000	Anyway, Bobby says they are still mail order.
6886000	6888000	They never shifted away, so I guess they, that is still.
6888000	6891000	I thought they, I thought they, I heard they had closed it down.
6891000	6894000	Because I, I, maybe I just ended my account at some point.
6894000	6896000	But I thought I'd heard they closed down. Anyway.
6896000	6899000	Uh, so Gamefly's gonna shut down the streaming service, uh,
6899000	6902000	because, uh, EA, uh, got them.
6902000	6907000	Uh, Gamefly streaming launched in 2015 as part of Amazon Fire TV,
6907000	6910000	and now it's built into a lot of Samsung TVs and so forth.
6910000	6914000	You can still get games on the mail discs, so that is still a thing that happens.
6914000	6918000	Uh, but Gamefly streaming's closure, uh, is happening
6918000	6922000	when it seems like game streaming is, like, still a thing that's growing out there.
6922000	6926000	I mean, if you look at PlayStation Now, or you're looking at, uh,
6926000	6928000	you know, what Microsoft's been doing.
6928000	6933000	Uh, EA, of course, also has its own thing, the Origin Access Premier.
6933000	6936000	So I don't know if maybe some of what, of course,
6936000	6940000	well, maybe some of the things that Gamefly had, they're gonna fold into it
6940000	6944000	to make that more attractive or whatever. I don't know.
6944000	6950000	How can we micro, or how can we add microtransactions to game streaming?
6950000	6953000	Because I'm sure that's what they would want to know.
6953000	6956000	Fucking hate EA. Seriously.
6956000	6961000	Alright. Well, anyhow, I learned today that Gamefly is still around.
6961000	6964000	I seriously thought they had gone under years ago.
6964000	6968000	Maybe I'm mixing them up with, um, I must be mixing them up with somebody else.
6968000	6971000	Is there another? Well, I knew about that one.
6971000	6975000	But, yeah, I used to get dissed from them too, and then it just kind of stopped.
6975000	6978000	I don't know. Anyway, maybe I did cancel it when I wasn't paying attention.
6978000	6981000	Uh, Bobby says, uh, I'm mixing them up with OnLive, maybe.
6981000	6983000	Maybe that's it. Maybe I'm mixing them up with OnLive,
6983000	6985000	even though I know OnLive was a streaming thing.
6985000	6987000	But anyway, let's move on. It doesn't matter anymore.
6987000	6990000	Dark Sakura, you got another story for us.
6990000	6992000	Yes, I do have another story.
6992000	6996000	Um, in this story, it has to do with King of Fighters.
6996000	6999000	And Pokemon Go-ish stuff.
6999000	7003000	It's basically an augmented reality the King of Fighters Go.
7003000	7008000	Um, you wander around picking up different fighters and fighting them,
7008000	7011000	and then they join your repertoire.
7011000	7017000	Yeah, you just keep building teams to fight other, other players.
7017000	7022000	So, um, it looks interesting. I guess it should be fun.
7022000	7025000	I don't see, I don't know if it's going to come out in the US, though.
7025000	7027000	Maybe it's still in testing?
7027000	7030000	But yeah, it's supposed to be doing, it was originally titled, um,
7030000	7033000	King of Fighters the Orochi Saga Go,
7033000	7039000	which means it was based around the 95, 97 Orochi Saga from the game.
7039000	7044000	So, the beta was from July 27th through July 31st
7044000	7048000	for iPhone, uh, using TestFlight.
7048000	7050000	And the Android beta is unannounced.
7050000	7054000	But maybe, maybe we'll see it. Who knows?
7054000	7056000	Now, this is a Go game I would check out.
7056000	7058000	It can't be worse than Garfield Go.
7058000	7061000	Like, you want to, and that Jurassic Park game.
7061000	7064000	My sister is, she plays that game, the Jurassic Park one,
7064000	7066000	and she's like, you gotta play this game.
7066000	7067000	I'm like, no.
7067000	7070000	It's, it's okay. It's better than the Garfield one,
7070000	7071000	but it's just, it's not Pokemon.
7071000	7072000	Garfield's just crap.
7072000	7074000	Yeah, the Garfield one is garbage.
7074000	7075000	But I play, I check out King of Fighters.
7075000	7077000	It was Garfield bitch.
7077000	7081000	Anyway, um, so I, I hate to keep going back to this,
7081000	7082000	but Evo is going on, I suppose.
7082000	7084000	And this, this just came across my Twitter feed.
7084000	7090000	So, uh, SonicFox, who just won, uh, tweeted this, uh, five minutes ago.
7090000	7095000	I'm gay. Also the best DBFZ player on this fucking planet.
7095000	7096000	Don't forget it.
7096000	7097000	Awesome.
7097000	7099000	To which I respond, work bitch.
7102000	7105000	So yeah, the, and I looked at the bio for, uh, this individual.
7105000	7109000	I'm a black queer furry who will mixture shit in fighting games.
7109000	7111000	Own it, live it, love it, work.
7111000	7113000	That's all I have to say about that.
7114000	7115000	I am now a fan.
7115000	7119000	I need to find that tweet just so I can go, yes, bitch.
7119000	7124000	Uh, it's, um, his Twitter is SonicFox5000.
7124000	7125000	Okay.
7125000	7126000	There you go.
7126000	7127000	All right.
7127000	7129000	Let's, uh, let's continue on.
7129000	7131000	Uh, Loki, just another story for us.
7131000	7132000	And then, uh, just a couple more.
7132000	7134000	We're gonna get to the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,
7134000	7135000	all one word on Skype.
7135000	7137000	So I'm probably gonna have a controversial opinion about this,
7137000	7140000	but let's just talk about the story first and then we'll get to that.
7140000	7146000	So there is this little girl by the name of, um, Penny McDonald,
7146000	7150000	and she has released her debut game, Answer the Question, on Steam.
7150000	7153000	Um, what's notable is Penny is only seven years old,
7153000	7155000	and apparently since she was a toddler,
7155000	7158000	she has been interested in making games.
7158000	7160000	I guess her dad is a game developer,
7160000	7163000	and she even started with learning, um, you know,
7163000	7167000	Windows 98 learning in QBasic and that kind of stuff.
7167000	7169000	And so now she's released her.
7169000	7173000	She released her text game, um, onto Steam,
7173000	7176000	and it's cute that it's on there.
7176000	7180000	And so it's basically this terminal-looking game
7180000	7185000	where you answer math questions, and that's it for 99 cents.
7185000	7188000	So here's where I get controversial about it.
7188000	7191000	I think it's great that she's releasing a game.
7191000	7192000	Why is it on Steam?
7192000	7193000	Yes.
7193000	7194000	Why the fuck is it on Steam?
7194000	7195000	Like, I get it.
7195000	7198000	I'm all for her releasing a game.
7198000	7202000	That's where itch.io is a great place to do that, okay?
7202000	7205000	This shit does not need to be on Steam.
7205000	7207000	I mean, I guess I shouldn't judge
7207000	7210000	because there's a lot of garbage on Steam,
7210000	7215000	but if this was anybody else making a game,
7215000	7218000	it would just be like, why the fuck is this on Steam?
7218000	7220000	And it's just because she's a little girl, and that's fine.
7220000	7222000	You know, encourage her to make games,
7222000	7225000	but it does not belong on Steam.
7226000	7229000	It doesn't. It just doesn't.
7229000	7234000	I don't want to, like, crap on a seven-year-old's game.
7234000	7237000	And I haven't played the game, so I can't speak to the quality.
7237000	7239000	But, you know, to be fair, it's fine.
7239000	7242000	It's gonna get buried under the garbage that is Steam anyway.
7242000	7245000	So whatever. I guess it's not really hurting anything,
7245000	7248000	but it's not helping anything either.
7248000	7250000	It's great. Good for her.
7250000	7252000	I hope she keeps channeling that energy
7252000	7254000	into continuing to make good games
7254000	7258000	and so forth, but yeah, it is a little weird that, you know,
7258000	7261000	you're right, it's gonna get buried under all the other garbage on Steam.
7261000	7264000	Yeah, it's her first game, and that's fine, but...
7264000	7267000	I'm not gonna release... Okay.
7267000	7270000	I showed Rob what my first game is.
7270000	7272000	It's not even my first game.
7272000	7274000	He did show me during the break.
7274000	7276000	It does exist. I've seen it.
7276000	7279000	But I'm not releasing that shit on Steam.
7279000	7283000	No. I'm not doing that, because it's garbage.
7284000	7286000	It's just to learn. I mean...
7286000	7288000	You should call a seven-year-old's game garbage.
7288000	7290000	I'm not saying it's garbage. I'm saying, like, it's QBasic.
7290000	7293000	And QBasic, that's what you expect out of QBasic, is that shit.
7293000	7295000	It's limited.
7295000	7297000	It's very limited, and...
7298000	7299000	I'm...
7300000	7302000	Great, but polish that up and then release it.
7302000	7305000	It's like, just because you make your first game,
7305000	7307000	does that mean it's ready to be published?
7308000	7311000	Make more games. Make a dozen more games.
7311000	7315000	And then when you get, like, a really polished game, then release it.
7316000	7320000	But I don't say, I guess there's no harm that it's on there,
7320000	7323000	because it's not really taking up marketplace space, but it's...
7324000	7328000	It's just showing that Steam has no quality control.
7328000	7331000	Because, not even, at least this is a functional game.
7331000	7333000	And it works.
7333000	7336000	We're gonna assume she did not implement a Bitcoin miner in the game.
7336000	7339000	Right. That'd be the twist.
7340000	7342000	Why are my resources so high?
7342000	7344000	There's, like, text on the screen, and that's it.
7344000	7346000	All you gullible people that fell for the...
7346000	7349000	No, I shouldn't even say that. I'm sorry. I shouldn't say that.
7350000	7351000	And then that's cool.
7351000	7354000	And I used to make games like you and basic as well,
7354000	7359000	but I'm not gonna go grab that shit and say it's ready for publishing.
7359000	7360000	I don't know.
7360000	7363000	I just, that's where I have kind of a little bit of an issue with it,
7363000	7366000	but, you know, I'm glad that she's trying...
7366000	7368000	She's trying... You know, it's actually...
7368000	7370000	Wait, the color is kind of a tangent a little bit.
7370000	7372000	I don't know if you remember,
7372000	7376000	there was a Kickstarter campaign
7376000	7379000	that was this person's first game,
7379000	7382000	and they were, I think, seven or eight years old as well,
7382000	7384000	and it was, like, an RPG.
7384000	7386000	She wanted to make an RPG an RPG maker,
7386000	7389000	and it was, like, a troll quest thing or something like that.
7389000	7391000	She was gonna fight against the internet trolls
7391000	7394000	because people were saying that this Kickstarter campaign was bullshit
7394000	7397000	because she wanted, like, thousands of dollars to build
7397000	7399000	what essentially is an RPG maker game.
7401000	7404000	It's like that only got attention because of the age.
7404000	7406000	This is only getting attention because it's age as well.
7407000	7410000	But I think where I agree,
7410000	7414000	she should make games, she should put them out there, not on Steam.
7414000	7415000	That's where I'm at.
7415000	7416000	All right.
7416000	7418000	So, you know, people want to fight you in chat, so here we go.
7418000	7420000	Bobby is starting off going,
7420000	7421000	so where does it belong?
7421000	7422000	Somebody did respond.
7422000	7423000	You'd mentioned itch.io.
7423000	7424000	Bobby said,
7424000	7426000	I released my first game in middle school,
7426000	7428000	and four people bought it.
7428000	7431000	That's four more people than would have never bought it
7431000	7432000	if I'd not published it.
7433000	7435000	But you could put it on itch.io,
7435000	7437000	you can sell it on itch.io,
7437000	7439000	and I see no problem with that.
7439000	7443000	The great thing about PC games is you can self-publish all you want.
7443000	7444000	Yeah, you can do that.
7444000	7445000	It just doesn't need to be...
7445000	7447000	Priz, back when Bobby was in middle school,
7447000	7451000	I'm assuming those were the days of shareware and BBSes and all that stuff,
7451000	7452000	which is how we kinda sold our games.
7452000	7453000	You know what? And that's fine.
7453000	7457000	I guess, you know, at this point in the condition Steam is in,
7457000	7459000	what's it gonna hurt?
7459000	7461000	I mean, I just think in the bigger picture,
7461000	7464000	Steam should have some quality control stuff.
7464000	7467000	I don't totally disagree with you, Loki.
7467000	7472000	I get that you're pointing out that this is a Q basic game,
7472000	7473000	and you don't want to...
7473000	7474000	It's not even a Q basic game.
7474000	7477000	I think it's something, but it resembles a basic game.
7477000	7479000	You don't want to crap on the efforts of a little girl.
7479000	7481000	You want to see her succeed,
7481000	7484000	but Steam is maybe not, because this kind of exacerbates
7484000	7485000	what the issue is with Steam,
7485000	7490000	is that Steam will let literally anything in its door
7490000	7492000	when that is not what Steam used to be.
7492000	7496000	Steam was a heavy, curated place that had these, you know,
7496000	7500000	indie games and big AAA games alike and so forth,
7500000	7504000	and then it just is kind of turned into the Google Play App Store at some point,
7504000	7506000	where it's just everything and anything.
7506000	7509000	Right, and that's kind of where I'm at with it.
7509000	7510000	It's just like...
7512000	7514000	I don't know. I don't know really how to react to this.
7514000	7518000	I mean, I guess it's cool that she's got a game that she's publishing.
7518000	7519000	Cool.
7519000	7520000	I mean...
7521000	7522000	I don't know.
7522000	7524000	I went through a C++ course.
7524000	7527000	The first one I did was...
7528000	7529000	It was terminal.
7529000	7531000	It was making terminal games,
7531000	7536000	and one of those was like a roulette or slot machine game
7536000	7537000	or something like that.
7537000	7540000	That would be like if I published that on Steam.
7540000	7543000	Like, it's shit, okay?
7543000	7545000	Like, the fact that a seven-year-old made it,
7545000	7548000	it makes it less shit because it's like,
7548000	7550000	wow, this is pretty amazing for a seven-year-old.
7550000	7552000	Like, if my son made that, that's great.
7552000	7554000	I would be like, wow, that's pretty awesome that you made a game.
7554000	7557000	I would not go to publish it on Steam, though.
7557000	7558000	I would say no.
7558000	7560000	I'm like, hey, if you want to...
7560000	7562000	We can try to sell a couple copies.
7562000	7566000	I'll put it up on itch.io and I'll tweet out some stuff to my friends
7566000	7569000	and we'll see if someone wants to buy it for $0.99,
7569000	7571000	because that's all it is, is $0.99.
7572000	7574000	But I'm not going to put it on Steam.
7574000	7578000	Even if it was my own kid making a game that looked exactly like that,
7578000	7579000	I would not put that on Steam,
7579000	7581000	because I know that's not where it belongs.
7582000	7583000	I don't know.
7583000	7587000	Like, if somebody bakes a cake in an Easy-Bake oven,
7587000	7590000	you don't go put it on the fucking grocery store shelf
7590000	7592000	to sell it next to the cakes that they make.
7592000	7595000	Actually, you put it on YouTube to make it a specialty channel.
7595000	7598000	Bobby Blackwolf says, I'm going to go back to this point.
7598000	7600000	Why is it okay for itch.io to have garbage and not Steam?
7600000	7603000	Shouldn't we be arguing for quality control for all?
7603000	7604000	I actually...
7604000	7606000	No, I think there is a difference between the two.
7606000	7610000	I think itch.io is, by nature, an experimental playground,
7610000	7612000	and there is less curation that goes on there,
7612000	7615000	and that is both part of what makes it great
7615000	7617000	is because you are going to find things there
7617000	7619000	that you are not going to find anything else
7619000	7621000	because of, by nature, what it is,
7621000	7623000	and it's also going to make it, yeah,
7623000	7625000	you're going to play a lot of garbage that's on itch.io,
7625000	7629000	but when you go to itch.io, you know that's what it is.
7629000	7632000	And they also have kind of like blog stuff too,
7632000	7636000	like it's a big old like, hey, I'm seven and this is my first game,
7636000	7638000	and you can talk a little bit about it and stuff.
7638000	7640000	I mean, I guess you could do that on Steam as well,
7640000	7642000	but Steam is like a commercial marketplace.
7642000	7643000	itch.io, I don't really...
7643000	7645000	I mean, I know they sell games on itch.io,
7645000	7648000	but I'm not like, I'm getting the new release games on itch.io.
7648000	7652000	It's the indie record store versus, I guess, Walmart,
7652000	7654000	because there are no big record stores anymore.
7654000	7657000	Like, the same could be said with like GOG or something like that.
7657000	7660000	I wouldn't want it on GOG either. I wouldn't want it on Humble Store.
7660000	7664000	It's not viable for a commercial marketplace.
7664000	7666000	It's a neat indie thing.
7666000	7668000	It's cool that you made your project
7668000	7671000	and that you want to sell it and see if you can sell something,
7671000	7673000	but like, I don't understand.
7673000	7675000	Okay, for me, MXC, and we'll move on here in a minute,
7675000	7678000	but for me, MXC here makes a really good point in my opinion.
7678000	7680000	I think it kind of hits what it is for me.
7680000	7684000	I think people still have memories of when Steam was curated at all.
7684000	7687000	So Steam, as of today, causes annoyance.
7687000	7689000	itch.io never attempted to gatekeep,
7689000	7692000	and that was a huge cause for excitement with indie devs.
7692000	7695000	With that said, itch.io does very well with highlighting
7695000	7698000	some of their best recent releases with post and front page widgets,
7698000	7700000	even with their own massive libraries.
7700000	7702000	I think you said that very well, MXC.
7702000	7704000	I do want to read this comment from Sia Tabiri as well.
7704000	7707000	Loki, I partially agree with you, but I think this might be a case of,
7707000	7709000	I can't hold others to the same standards I would myself and my family.
7709000	7712000	You can't fault someone else for putting out what they might believe is their best
7712000	7714000	or what they believe is worthy of something,
7714000	7718000	even when it's not something you would personally be willing to release.
7718000	7720000	I understand that, but it's not her that put it out.
7720000	7721000	It's her parents that put it out,
7721000	7724000	because she didn't front the $100 for Steam to do all that.
7724000	7727000	But that's fine. You know what? At this point, what's it going to hurt?
7727000	7729000	I mean, honestly, it's not going to hurt anything
7729000	7732000	because Steam is in the condition that it is.
7732000	7736000	And to be honest, her game is probably better than a lot of the shovelwork garbage
7736000	7737000	that people put out there.
7737000	7738000	And it's not going to be mining for Bitcoin.
7738000	7739000	And it's not mining for Bitcoin.
7739000	7742000	So she's already ahead of the pack in that sense whatsoever.
7742000	7746000	It's 99 cents. I shouldn't really be taking offense to it.
7746000	7748000	And it's really, I don't take offense to the game itself.
7748000	7749000	I take offense to Steam.
7749000	7752000	Steam as a whole is where I have problems.
7752000	7754000	I'm going to read one more comment and then I'm going to wrap up here
7754000	7756000	because I know Dark Soccer is going to be heading out in a minute.
7756000	7757000	AkumaJP in chat says,
7757000	7761000	If there is a place for a child to place their game, I will say put it there,
7761000	7764000	but there's none, so I think she can put it there if she wants.
7764000	7767000	And so I guess defer to the comment about, you know,
7767000	7770000	you don't have a problem with the game, you have a problem with Steam.
7770000	7771000	Right.
7771000	7773000	And it's the same problem you said at the beginning of the show.
7773000	7774000	I get it.
7774000	7777000	Maybe they just need a separate place for, not like Greenlight was,
7777000	7780000	but maybe just like the Steam Playground or something.
7780000	7781000	Yeah.
7781000	7783000	Steam IO. No, I'm just kidding. Don't call it that.
7783000	7786000	At any rate, good for her though.
7786000	7789000	And I hope that she's encouraged to do more with her success.
7789000	7790000	Exactly.
7790000	7793000	Like it's a tricky subject because you don't want to deter her
7793000	7795000	that the issue is Steam and what it is and isn't allowing.
7795000	7797000	The issue is not that she made a game.
7797000	7798000	Good for her.
7798000	7801000	Like I hope she will channel that into making more games
7801000	7805000	and improving the game that she has started and continues to do that.
7805000	7808000	So I hope that is clear in this argument.
7808000	7810000	Anyway, Dark Soccer, I know you have to head out.
7810000	7811000	Yes.
7811000	7814000	So anything you want to say to listeners before you head out?
7814000	7815000	I'm fucking tired.
7815000	7819000	No, seriously, I've had a very busy day today
7819000	7823000	and I've been out in the sunlight because I helped with the charity
7823000	7827000	carwash today this morning and it was very fun.
7827000	7834000	We made over $400 for a Nevada County HIV testing,
7834000	7836000	which they have zero government support.
7836000	7837000	Really?
7837000	7838000	Yeah.
7838000	7839000	They have no funding.
7839000	7841000	So we've raised $400 for them.
7841000	7842000	Wow.
7842000	7844000	And we're adding in another $100 from our local,
7844000	7846000	you know, from the sisters.
7846000	7848000	So we are making a nice $500 donation.
7848000	7849000	Very cool.
7849000	7851000	I'm surprised to hear about that because that,
7851000	7853000	we need to talk off air about some of this stuff.
7853000	7854000	Okay.
7854000	7855000	Okay.
7855000	7859000	But at any rate, you know, it makes me feel good to do these things,
7859000	7861000	but at the same time, I'm really freaking tired.
7861000	7862000	Sure, of course.
7862000	7865000	So it was, yeah, and all of you guys, you know,
7865000	7868000	I would encourage that if you feel something that, you know,
7868000	7869000	very strongly about something,
7869000	7872000	look into your local communities and see how you can help, you know,
7872000	7876000	even if it's volunteering at an event for a couple of hours
7876000	7881000	or even hosting a video game marathon to raise money for charity,
7881000	7883000	you know, look into that.
7883000	7885000	I'm going to be doing the same thing for my mom,
7885000	7888000	probably in a couple of weeks to raise money for my mom.
7888000	7894000	So, um, just if you care about your community, put your heart in it,
7894000	7897000	put your, put your actions where your mouth is.
7897000	7898000	All right.
7898000	7900000	And on that note, we are going to get to one more story.
7900000	7901000	I still have one more story here,
7901000	7904000	and then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,
7904000	7905000	all one word on Skype.
7905000	7907000	Before we get to Skype line, I have one more story.
7907000	7909000	That last story took a little longer and I thought it would, uh,
7909000	7913000	but this story is about an undiscovered, uh, Atari 2600.
7913000	7915000	I was going to say undiscovered country.
7915000	7919000	No, undiscovered sequel to an Atari 2600 game that has been found all
7919000	7921000	these years later, basically.
7921000	7925000	Um, it's a prototype for Keystone Capers 2.
7925000	7927000	Do you ever play Keystone Capers on Atari 2600?
7927000	7930000	It was the cop and robber game by Activision,
7930000	7932000	and it's actually a really good game.
7932000	7933000	It was a fun little game.
7933000	7935000	For Atari 2600 it was a really fun game.
7935000	7939000	Well, unfortunately the prototype, it isn't really like a playable thing.
7939000	7941000	It just kind of shows the policeman running,
7941000	7945000	but it does show that the sequel was originally going to be set on a train.
7945000	7949000	So it shows this train that's basically like multi-screen that, uh,
7949000	7952000	the cop is kind of running between and the effects with like the mountain in
7952000	7955000	the background and the scrolling with the cactuses and everything.
7955000	7958000	The effects are pretty darn good for an Atari 2600.
7958000	7959000	Right.
7959000	7960000	You know what I mean? So that's, that's really neat.
7960000	7963000	So, um, yeah, basically this ended up being kind of a tech demo.
7963000	7965000	It's not an actual playable game or anything,
7965000	7968000	but I'm sure it's just a matter of time before this ROM hits the internet,
7968000	7972000	since the, uh, prototype, I guess, went to the NVGM.
7972000	7973000	I'm not sure what that acronym is,
7973000	7977000	but I'm assuming it's some type of game museum or a, you know,
7977000	7979000	place that, uh, archives this type of stuff.
7979000	7981000	So that is, that is really cool.
7981000	7984000	Um, there was some information on this game a little while ago.
7984000	7985000	Um, it's just,
7985000	7988000	this is the first time video has come out of it because I think he was
7988000	7990000	quoted in an interview and I'm a programmer.
7990000	7993000	Dan kitchen was quoted in an interview once saying, you know,
7993000	7995000	I did a sequel to ketone capers.
7995000	7999000	It was a cop on a train and it was called a Keystone cannon ball was what it
7999000	8002000	was going to be called. Um, but this is the first time we're like seeing video.
8002000	8003000	And again,
8003000	8006000	it's 2018 and we're seeing video for the first time of a game that probably
8006000	8010000	should have been released in around 1984. So yeah, pretty cool.
8010000	8013000	Pretty cool. Anyway, with that, the Skype line is open.
8013000	8015000	Orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.
8015000	8018000	If you'd like to give us a call about anything we've talked about tonight,
8018000	8020000	or maybe something we haven't talked about tonight, uh,
8020000	8022000	while we wait for a call to come in,
8022000	8025000	I don't know if we have any quick last minute stories we want to get to Loki.
8025000	8027000	Uh, I didn't. Oh yeah.
8027000	8030000	Actually I was going to mention something as kind of a surprise this week.
8030000	8034000	La Milana to release. No, I'm sure dark tattoo is all over that one. Yeah.
8034000	8037000	So they, I guess announced and released it or something.
8037000	8039000	I know I thought it was announced already. Yeah.
8039000	8042000	They've been teasing it for awhile, but then it just kind of like came out.
8042000	8044000	It just came out. Yeah. Cause they had a Kickstarter.
8044000	8047000	So it's been known about for awhile. So anyway, we do have a call coming in.
8047000	8050000	Let's get to it. Hi. You're on orange laundry. Who's this? Hey, what's going on?
8050000	8053000	It's Rama. Hey Rama. Good to hear from you. What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
8053000	8056000	Uh, not too much. Besides the fact that I hate Skype version eight,
8056000	8060000	but that's a story and a rant for another time. Yes, I, I,
8060000	8064000	I'm using this Skype windows XP until I can't anymore, but, uh,
8064000	8066000	we're talking about off air.
8066000	8068000	Some of the upgrades we're going to be doing pretty soon.
8068000	8069000	I'm hoping by the end of the year,
8069000	8072000	it's going to be a very different sounding OLR than it is now.
8072000	8074000	I hear you. I already told my staff,
8074000	8078000	we're moving to discord for this week's show. End of story. Oh, interesting.
8078000	8079000	You know,
8079000	8083000	a lot of people are doing voice chat on discord and I've been asked if OLR is
8083000	8087000	going to make a move like that. And, um, TBD.
8087000	8091000	We'll just leave it at that. Well, there is one issue with Skype eight.
8091000	8095000	If they fixed automatic microphone control, they fix it properly.
8095000	8098000	We're sticking around. If not, it's getting uninstalled. Simple as that.
8098000	8101000	Yikes. I still know a lot of people that use Skype.
8101000	8103000	I always hear this argument like nobody uses Skype,
8103000	8108000	but I'm like all the online big brother survivor reality game stuff that I've
8108000	8112000	played, like they're all on Skype and they all chat with Skype regularly.
8112000	8116000	Like it's a big platform and I still think tons of people are using Skype to
8116000	8119000	like call family in another country and things like that.
8119000	8121000	Like I think Skype is still like super popular.
8121000	8125000	It just isn't popular with the techies. I think is what's happening.
8125000	8129000	Yeah. And tech community basically using, um,
8129000	8134000	maybe discord, but for the most part slack and you have Microsoft teams,
8134000	8137000	but you got to think about it. When you install windows on your PC,
8137000	8140000	like windows 10 or windows eight, Skype is right there.
8140000	8143000	So it was like an easy one to go to. Yeah, no, for sure.
8143000	8146000	That's part of the reason why that's part of the reason why. Well, I mean, again,
8146000	8150000	we, we've been taking calls on Skype since I don't want to say before anyone,
8150000	8153000	but I really think before anyone, um,
8153000	8158000	back in like 2003 or four was our first Skype call. So, um,
8158000	8162000	you know, we just stuck with it. We saw no reason to leave it yet.
8163000	8164000	Yeah, basically.
8164000	8167000	But let me say what I got to say then I'm going to get out of here so that
8167000	8171000	other people can join in and call and have fun. Well,
8171000	8175000	first thing, your threat of a punishment,
8175000	8177000	you got to try harder than that. Good sir.
8180000	8185000	I tried. Somebody, somebody out there's ears were bleeding. I don't know.
8185000	8187000	I don't know. What am I supposed to do? We had no emails.
8187000	8192000	I had to fill the segment somehow. This is true. This is true. And, um,
8192000	8197000	as we all know, last weekend was the Overwatch grand finals. Yep.
8197000	8201000	Which London won, right? Yeah. I didn't watch,
8201000	8205000	but I was actually hanging out with some of my friends actually worked the event.
8205000	8208000	Oh, fun. Yeah. Uh, one of my friends, Cassie,
8208000	8213000	she was the official May cosplayer for the event. Oh, that's pretty cool.
8213000	8216000	Yeah. And, and our, I think her husband who works for Blizzard,
8216000	8219000	he was part of the whole tech support team and the breakdown.
8219000	8222000	So like Sunday me, her and a few others,
8222000	8225000	we actually did like a little walking tour of New York city and it was kind of
8225000	8228000	fun. Very cool. Yeah. It's,
8228000	8231000	it's going to be interesting to see how the league continues to grow next year.
8231000	8235000	I've heard they already, uh, have two expansions confirmed.
8235000	8238000	One of them is going to be Atlanta. Uh, the other one is the city in China,
8238000	8241000	which I do not recall the pronunciation of off the top of my heads. I apologize,
8241000	8244000	but it's another, uh, team out of China, uh, and Atlanta.
8244000	8247000	Although I don't know if they are, I mean,
8247000	8251000	I one place I've been a little bit critical of Overwatch league is in granted
8251000	8253000	this is probably just a first year thing,
8253000	8256000	but the fact that these guys, these teams don't live in the cities they
8256000	8261000	represent, they're all in LA playing at the Blizzard LA arena. Um,
8261000	8265000	yeah. Um, there's something about that that I, that I know. So yeah,
8265000	8268000	that's, we'll just leave it at that. Well, I, well for what it's worth, I,
8268000	8271000	it's, it's public and out there that that is not the longterm goal,
8271000	8275000	that they are looking at building more arenas and that the longterm goal is it
8275000	8276000	would be more like football or whatever,
8276000	8279000	where these teams would be in their cities like that is something that
8279000	8282000	Blizzard's gone on record saying. So if they're making moves to do that,
8282000	8285000	I wouldn't be surprised. I'm, I'm actually happy to hear it.
8285000	8287000	Well, that's good. I'm all for that.
8287000	8290000	I'd like to see more teams and you know, if you remember,
8290000	8294000	I was very critical of like esports and so forth.
8294000	8297000	I'm starting to warm up to it.
8297000	8303000	Maybe if they had really gotten more into televising gaming events like
8303000	8307000	this, like five, 10 years earlier, I'd be all for it.
8307000	8308000	Cause I'm sitting here thinking, you know,
8308000	8313000	I can't see myself watching somebody play street fighter five, you know,
8313000	8317000	whereas I will flip the channel and sit there and watch my favorite sports
8317000	8320000	team win a game or something like that, you know?
8320000	8322000	And, and my big thing is,
8322000	8326000	and still continues to be is that I hope the expansion of the league will
8326000	8329000	lead to more diversity because this is how I said,
8329000	8332000	this is why I would like the Overwatch league to be successful.
8332000	8335000	I'm not out here shouting, shut them down or anything.
8335000	8338000	But the great thing about expansion is that you don't have to let anyone
8338000	8341000	that's already there go. So these, you know,
8341000	8346000	these white dudes that are all makeup and, and, you know,
8346000	8351000	a lot of folks from Asia as well that play on these teams,
8351000	8353000	none of these folks have to go anywhere,
8353000	8355000	but maybe we could get some more women.
8355000	8358000	I know there are more women that play Overwatch than one, you know?
8358000	8364000	So maybe we can get some more diversity with the ethnicities and nobody who's
8364000	8367000	currently there has to go. That's the great thing about expansions.
8367000	8370000	Again, there's something that I,
8370000	8374000	that I was told that I have to tell you off air.
8374000	8376000	You'll have to tell me off air. Will it make me happy or sad?
8376000	8380000	I don't know. I know you pretty well, Rob,
8380000	8383000	but I can't predict how you would take this type of news.
8383000	8386000	All right. Now you got me curious now, but all right, fair enough.
8386000	8389000	Fair enough. I respect the privacy of whatever it is you got going.
8389000	8393000	So, all right. Well, my friend, any other thoughts?
8393000	8397000	Uh, no, that's it. I am basically getting ready for Otacon this weekend.
8397000	8400000	So, uh, my liver is on full standby.
8400000	8403000	Have a great time. That'll be me in a few weeks getting ready for DragonCon.
8403000	8409000	And then after that, we have to have a VoG reunion part due at MagFest.
8409000	8412000	Oh, I hope so. I would love to go to MagFest again.
8412000	8414000	You know, MagWest is this coming weekend.
8414000	8415000	Yeah, I know.
8415000	8418000	Yeah. So, uh, we'll see. I, I may make a cameo.
8418000	8421000	Uh, one of my buddies is really trying to get me to go and I'm gonna,
8421000	8424000	I have plans to go to San Jose for something non-related anyway.
8424000	8427000	So I may drop in for a little bit. So we'll see.
8427000	8428000	Go for it, man.
8428000	8431000	Yeah, I just might. All right, my friend, I'm gonna let you go though.
8431000	8432000	All right, you too. Take care, brother.
8432000	8433000	Take care. Bye.
8433000	8436000	All right. Uh, let's see. I saw a couple other calls coming in.
8436000	8438000	So let me see if we can get another one of those.
8438000	8442000	At Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype before we wrap up here for the night.
8442000	8445000	Uh, and move on. So let's get to another call.
8445000	8447000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8448000	8449000	Hey, what's up? It's Kaijuto.
8449000	8451000	Hey, Kaijuto. What's on your mind, buddy?
8451000	8453000	So much. You can hear me, right?
8453000	8454000	Yep. You are great.
8455000	8458000	Hi, you were talking earlier about, um, No Man's Sky.
8458000	8459000	Yeah.
8459000	8463000	And how you can, um, you know, you had fun playing with Bobby Blackwolf and, uh, who was the other person? Dungeon Buster?
8463000	8466000	Yep. Dungeon Buster. My buddy Neil pops in now and then too.
8466000	8473000	Yeah. So you said you guys are having fun, but you don't know, like, the longevity of that because you really weren't doing anything together.
8473000	8480000	And I just wanted to remind you that there is voice chat. I think with voice chat, that opens the door to so much fun because then you can communicate.
8480000	8485000	You're exploring together. You know, somebody might find something. They call you over to check it out.
8485000	8488000	You know, you just take a long, kind of like stand by me in space.
8488000	8495000	I guess. Like, you know, and maybe things that have happened to me, like when the biological horrors showed up and I started screaming on my stream.
8495000	8501000	Like if Bobby, if Bobby had been there too, when I did that, uh, then at least there would have been two of us to take them on.
8501000	8509000	And maybe that's the trick to doing that stuff a little easier is to bring some friends along to zap those aliens down since you kind of know what you're in for.
8509000	8512000	Um, so maybe, you know, maybe there is some stuff. I just kind of feel like,
8512000	8519000	Not just zap, but I just mean that communication aspect.
8519000	8524000	Yeah, for sure. And since we've been streaming, when we play online together, we do talk and you know that again, it was fun.
8524000	8530000	And I'm not saying like, you know, it's just when you kind of start to play the game on your own, you're really kind of exploring the story.
8530000	8536000	You find that a lot of it is about how much have you explored? How many words have you learned?
8536000	8548000	How many things, you know, and it does seem like you're still kind of in a solo, a story, which if I, if the spoilers from the first iteration of the game still hold true about what the whole thing kind of ends up being at the end,
8548000	8562000	I could see how it's kind of like a solo experience, but I mean, there's nothing wrong with like kind of sharing with that with other people, but I'm just like, I don't see myself playing through this with somebody by my side for the entirety 60 hours or whatever it takes to get through the story. You know what I mean?
8563000	8575000	I get you. But like, the way I see it is like, you know, I go back to when I was a kid and, you know, I used to get games like Monopoly and Clue and now, no, what the fuck did you not understand the rules, couldn't comprehend the rules.
8575000	8581000	I'm like six or seven trying to do like D&D and I'm just like, fuck it. And me and my friends just made up our own game.
8581000	8589000	And I think that sometimes with some games, you don't need to just play the solo mode. Just like I said, like explore, communicate with each other, just kind of make your own game.
8590000	8598000	Yeah, that's a fair perspective. I bet people are making, you know, No Man's Sky is a sandbox of sorts and I bet people are making their own games out of it.
8598000	8602000	You know, I think, aren't they supposed to have like racing and stuff that comes to the game eventually? I don't know.
8602000	8603000	I thought that they mentioned that.
8603000	8609000	I tuned into a random stream and some dude was driving a car. So I know that's a thing that I just haven't unveiled yet.
8609000	8610000	Yeah, they have vehicles.
8610000	8614000	I didn't even know that was a thing until I watched some random Twitch. So there's more.
8614000	8618000	Yeah, there's more yet. Okay, Dungeon Busters confirms there's a racing track module.
8619000	8629000	So that would be fun. So I think there's just, there's still more to discover. But yeah, I think it's, it's probably the sandbox versus the story of the game.
8629000	8637000	I don't think the story of the game is really going to be that great with the multiple people, but the sandbox element, absolutely. The racing track stuff will be fun.
8639000	8645000	Yeah, and as far as you know, there aren't any space battleships. I mean, I know that you fight in space for like, teaming up with each other.
8645000	8652000	I don't know how that works yet. I know you fight space pirates, but I don't know if you can team up with others to fight the space pirates.
8652000	8660000	Yeah, I remember it was that thing we asked. But yeah, that's, that's what I want to go out and just want to remind you that, you know, you can communicate and I have all types of fun.
8660000	8666000	Because I mean, I play a lot of games online, and people are so fucking quiet in space, it's just like, no one talks no more.
8666000	8667000	No, I see.
8667000	8671000	Unless they're like, some kind of party chat maybe, but I mean, it's very rare.
8671000	8676000	No, I mean, I appreciate the other perspective. You're right, sometimes the game is kind of what you make it, in a way.
8676000	8683000	And that's, especially with a sandbox game like Minecraft, like No Man's Sky, like, you know, a lot of games are out there right now.
8683000	8686000	It is what you make it, so.
8686000	8688000	All right, my friend, take care.
8689000	8691000	Yeah, anytime. Take care, buddy. Bye.
8692000	8697000	All right, that is going to wrap us up for tonight, because I have some plans after the show.
8697000	8702000	So sorry to those that didn't get through, but you can always email us. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8702000	8704000	Because, you know, we're not getting emails.
8704000	8706000	Or you can always tweet us at OLR.
8706000	8710000	That's a Twitter name I will not be changing, and I'm going to hold on to that three-letter Twitter name with dear life.
8710000	8714000	I may have given up a four-letter Twitter name, but I'm not giving up a three-letter one.
8714000	8716000	Anyway, that's going to do it for another episode of the show.
8716000	8719000	Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening tonight.
8719000	8723000	As I always say at the end of every show, if you enjoyed what you heard here tonight, please tell a friend or two about the show.
8723000	8726000	Help us spread a word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
8726000	8730000	But if the voices aren't here to air, well, what are we supposed to do?
8730000	8733000	I hope those of you that went to EVO had a good time.
8733000	8740000	I hope everybody that's been sitting at home gaming, whether it's No Man's Sky or building your own games or whatever,
8740000	8742000	I hope you've been having a good time as well.
8742000	8745000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
8745000	8749000	Oh, I forgot to mention the five-star reviews wherever you pick this show up.
8749000	8752000	iTunes, Google Play, those go a long way.
8752000	8756000	Although I guess somebody was telling me you can't actually rate things on Google Play. I thought you could.
8756000	8761000	And somebody had asked about Stitcher, so I haven't mentioned this in a while.
8761000	8771000	I did ask OLR to be removed from Stitcher some time ago, because their podcast refreshing feed was not staying current.
8771000	8777000	The show was months out of date, and nothing was changing, and they were doing nothing about it.
8777000	8779000	So when I got emails from Stitcher people that were like,
8779000	8786000	Why aren't you putting on any episodes? I said Stitcher is not representing our show the way it should be represented, and so I had it pulled.
8786000	8788000	So that's why we're not on Stitcher.
8788000	8793000	So I can recommend every podcast player out there except one.
8793000	8796000	Sorry, I know that one's pretty popular, but I'm sticking to it.
8796000	8804000	You've got to accurately reflect. If your niche is going to be delivering podcasts, you need to deliver podcasts.
8804000	8808000	Anyhow, not to dwell in a negative space, but you guys deserve to know the truth.
8808000	8810000	I'm not going to sugarcoat it. That's what it is.
8810000	8814000	All right, let's get final thoughts. Loki, your final thoughts.
8814000	8820000	I'm going to have to start a new game now that I finished the one I was working on.
8820000	8821000	All right.
8821000	8827000	I don't know. It'll probably be along the same lines, just not the way they did it.
8827000	8830000	I was going to say, you should make the one you did better.
8830000	8835000	I can, but I can only do so much with that. I already have an idea.
8835000	8843000	I don't want to do my grand, grand, grand idea that I had that was along the same lines, but maybe something smaller.
8843000	8844000	So we'll see.
8844000	8850000	Well, at least I can tell Bobby, I have seen a game that Loki has done.
8850000	8856000	It's very basic, but it's there. You did it.
8856000	8861000	We did it this time with the car as well, but that never got released.
8861000	8865000	Well, yeah, but you didn't, you didn't, and you still had unfinished stuff.
8865000	8866000	I always start that over and then...
8866000	8869000	There you go. There you go. All right.
8869000	8873000	Anyway, uh, let's see. That is, uh, that's going to do it for tonight's OLR.
8873000	8879000	My final thought tonight is, um, I need to, I need to spin some pokestops today. It's getting late.
8879000	8882000	All right, that's going to do it. Thank you guys so much for listening to the show tonight.
8882000	8886000	I appreciate it as always. We'll be back in seven days to do it all again with episode 741.
8886000	8893000	Until then, happy gaming. Be nice to each other online and shake hands at the end of it. Bye.
8916000	8925000	See you next week.
8946000	8956000	Bye.
