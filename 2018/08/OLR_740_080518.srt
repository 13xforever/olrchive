Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tonight, Nintendo pioneered the ability to make people buy the same games all over again, but now they've been officially recognized for these feats on the second round of NES Classic Production. Flashback to the 1980s and join us for this along with the rest of the night's gaming news starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on August the 5th of 2018, episode number 740 of our show. Here over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. Myself, Rob Roberts, joined by DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm arguing with my sum tables on numbers.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Are you spreadsheet warring?

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I am spreadsheeting right now.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I see.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Because I have to track how much money I spend.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Don't they do full on games in Excel? Isn't that like a thing people do?

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I know people do like Perler and knit patterns in Excel.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh, that makes a lot of sense actually to do like Perler patterns in Excel. Actually, our show role that lists all the stories we're going to do.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh, okay.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense though because Excel is great for like grids. Although, technically, I don't use Excel to do the show role. I use that open office.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
On my Mac it's numbers, on my PC it's open office.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So, there you go. Spreadsheets.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Except when people give me word for free or office for free.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:50,000
No, I was doing my budget because I have to put what I spent in there, but I've used spreadsheets plenty of times with my collection to do our personal inventory at home, which we need to do a new one.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Especially now that we have pinballs to add to it, which we have a new pinball.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Congrats. What'd you get?

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The Shadow.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh, wow. Like the Alec Baldwin movie from 94 or whatever?

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Tim Curry.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh, that's right. Tim Curry was in that.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Tim Curry is on our pinball.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's right. Oh, your pinball's been blessed.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But it's also a really interestingly built table.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Because it has like this upper section that you use like bumpers to get all these little targets.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I forgot what they call it. I've only seen that movie like once.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But anyway, that's our new table and we just gave back Whirlwind that we were borrowing for attorney.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Oh, I do like Whirlwind too though, but I understand.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Whirlwind had that little fan at the top that like when you get the bonus mode or whatever, it like blows air on you.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
When you're in like some stinky, sweaty bar, like that thing feels really good.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You know what I mean? Because I think they had a Whirlwind.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
There's this random bar in the Castro. I think Moby Dick's. You know the place I'm talking about, right?

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I haven't been to Moby Dick's, but I know it.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I think they had it.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And that was one of the things.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You know what would make sense for them to have?

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Huh?

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
A Fish Tales.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I know one of those bars in Castro had an Elvira table, which is very appropriate.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Now the Bolt, the leather bar in Sacramento, for those who don't know, has a Simpsons pinball party.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Oh, that's right. They do. That's right.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Pinball at bars. Fun. But I mean, that's kind of.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Not only can you play pinball, but you can see people getting fucked in the ass.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Well, no. Last time I was there, they had porn up on the TV.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Wow. Dark Sakura. Wow.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is a show about video games. You take your filth elsewhere.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm just saying, last time I was there, that's what I saw on the TV.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I need somebody pure and wholesome to clean up this mess that Dark Sakura's leaving.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So say hello to Techmaster Loki.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Hello.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Hi, Loki. How are you?

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Good.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Did you go to church today?

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Well, how are you doing?

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm doing fine.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah, what's new with you? Hopefully less bars and CD stories than what Dark Sakura's talking about.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Right.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I've been still working through my Unreal stuff, so I'm pretty much done with the lesson that I was on.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So are you doing the Cooking with Unity learnings?

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Sorry, it's like a code-along. It's a Udemy course.

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Oh, a code-along. Okay.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Type of thing.

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But the guy, he makes mistakes, and I usually catch him when he makes them.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But that's like the best way to learn.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But yeah, it is. And then I like how he kind of also gives different instructions.

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Like, okay, we've done this a couple times. Now I'm going to challenge you. Go do this.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And then he'll pause the video and go build this part out.

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And then you're done. And then you unpause it, and you make sure you did everything correct.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And that seems to be pretty effective.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Plus, I also went through and tweaked some things, and I've even been commenting on the course.

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Because I just got done with the audio portion of it, and he has a background track that plays.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Well, the way he triggered is, when basically the level starts, it plays the track.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Right.

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But it doesn't loop it. So I'm like, well, you can do it this way, and it will loop it every time.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Interesting. So you're trying to one-up the teacher. No, I get it.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Well, I'm just suggesting that, and not to mention the track he made for the background.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Does it loop well, but hey, whatever.

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Alright.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's just what it is. It's just a really basic get to know Unreal thing.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And I've gotten to know Unreal.

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Alright.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I just got an immediate announcement alert from Dan.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh boy, what?

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
A dude in the top eight is using Yamcha.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay, so I'm okay with this transition and your random interjection here.

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Because I actually want to talk about Evo here at the top of the show.

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Because obviously the Evo tournament is going on in Vegas right now.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Mandalay Bay is where they do that.

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So Evo's happening right now.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Our buddy Alex is there.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah, I know. I have a friend that's there too.

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Actually, I know a few people that are there.

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Good old Rob D from back in the All Games days.

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm seeing his stuff on Facebook. He's there right now.

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So anyhow, Evo's happening.

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I must admit, I haven't been watching a lot of it, though I have been following some of the drama.

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But you've been watching some of it, right, Jamie? What have you guys been watching?

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We watched a few of the matches, like last night, when we couldn't get any sleep.

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We were watching the Dragon Ball FighterZ play, watching some very interesting people.

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
This one guy busted out Ten Shinhan and was fucking kicking ass.

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I mean, all these guys were like, Brawley, perfect sell. Brawley, perfect sell.

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Dude busts out Ten Shinhan and owns. I'm like, yes!

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Did you see some of the drama going on with Smash?

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh man, the Smash Brothers stuff is pretty interesting because it came down to a Bayonetta versus Bayonetta fight.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And I guess some of the crowd is not super into that because I think some people feel Bayonetta is overpowered because of some of her combos and what have you.

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So again, you will have to excuse me, fighting game fans and Smash community fans.

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm not as up and up on what's going on, but I'm just kind of getting the cliff notes.

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So apparently the crowd was booing what was going on.

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But there was some interesting stuff that was happening with the contestants as well.

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't know if it was because of the booing or what, but when one of the matches started, and this was like the finals, the final match.

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
They just stood there for like a minute and they didn't fight because the crowd was booing.

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And so finally somebody came over and was like, you guys need to play.

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And so they played, but there was something really interesting that happened.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
One of the guys kind of accidentally fell or he lost his life falling off the edge.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It was like an accident, he wasn't supposed to do it.

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So what happened is the other player just jumped off the ledge and traded life for life.

125
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Which in the finals of a competitive thing, what in the heck?

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That sportsmanship.

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It is, but it's also like some people actually are viewing the stalemate that they were doing.

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
One of the guys flipped off the crowd as he walked off the stage.

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
They're seeing that as kind of like, basically kind of like everybody all around is being really immature.

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Now to be fair, the contestants I believe are 16 and 17.

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So I'll cut them some slack on the maturity because by definition they're not fully matured yet.

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So that's fine, but the audience, like I know there's a lot of adults in the audience.

133
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's some bullshit.

134
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And they need to like, I know.

135
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You didn't get your way.

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Or wah, Bayonetta is overpowered.

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Well, I mean, then don't show up.

138
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I don't know what to tell you.

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Surely there is a character that counters Bayonetta.

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Surely.

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And again, I don't know my smash as well.

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I agree, and don't call me Shirley.

143
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But there must be a character that counters Bayonetta pretty effectively that you would pick

144
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and maybe is not otherwise a stellar pick.

145
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But if you wanted to take out a Bayonetta, you could do it.

146
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I don't know.

147
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Anyway.

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Well, at any rate, Dan just messages me because he was like, I want to see someone in the top eight using Yamcha.

149
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, someone's in the top eight using Yamcha.

150
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We'll go into the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

151
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
where of course we do tape live at VOG Network every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

152
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

153
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And we do get some live comments.

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Tigerclaw says the Smash Brothers community can be toxic.

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
SG100Matt says the whole community was shitty last night.

156
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Tigerclaw says if you can't counter Bayonetta, you suck at Smash Brothers.

157
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's as simple as that.

158
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But as SG100Matt points out, there isn't a counter.

159
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's part of the problem.

160
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And well, here's the thing.

161
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I don't want to blame an entire community

162
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
because I know people in the Smash Brothers community that are fucking awesome.

163
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So I don't want to be all like the entire community is...

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm not going to do that, but I am going to say that display of the community was poopy.

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And so y'all need to have a come to Jesus moment and like figure out why...

166
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Y'all need Satan.

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You need to figure out why that's okay to like boo children.

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm sorry, but 16 and 17 is still a child by legal definition.

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Why it is okay to boo children.

170
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And on top of that, I'm hearing shit about like death threats and shit

171
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
because of course we live in a social media era.

172
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Of course.

173
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You're sending death threats because they play the character you didn't like.

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Oh my God.

175
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
How fucking cool are you sending death threats to a 16 year old?

176
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Like, oh my God.

177
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Can I have your babies now?

178
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Where can I fuck this person?

179
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So obviously heavy sense of sarcasm I hope is clearly coming through.

180
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
None of this is acceptable.

181
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So we need the decent Smash Brothers people to like kick those other people out.

182
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But to be fair, this is a problem that is not unique to Smash Brothers.

183
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This is a problem we have in the gaming community that's a little bigger than this.

184
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I don't know if we can answer this on a three hour show,

185
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
but it is going to take the less shitty people to stand up and say,

186
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Hey, stop being shitty.

187
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That's just how these sorts of problems get fixed.

188
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You have to call out.

189
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I mean, this goes, this goes for a lot of different things in life.

190
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Like, um, I don't want to get too deep, but the reality is when it comes to things like racism.

191
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Okay.

192
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Like it takes a unshitty non racist person to really stand out and call out the behavior of somebody who's being racist by saying,

193
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Hey, you're being racist and that sucks.

194
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And if you keep doing that, I'm not going to be your friend.

195
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It takes that to like counter that.

196
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Or as in wonder shows him that's racist.

197
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Sure.

198
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Well, you know what?

199
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Sometimes if you're at a bar and you see or out in public and you see a woman being harassed by some guy, you stand with her.

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yeah.

201
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I mean, and that is so.

202
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So honestly, the only reason I bring it up and go to that, like really like heavy place is because like this sort of behavior is not even necessarily unique to gaming culture,

203
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
although sadly it runs rampant in gaming culture.

204
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But like this is, this is a society problem that has to be stopped, solved by less shitty people sticking up for people who are marginalized.

205
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Standing up to it takes the kind of fortitude that takes some development.

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yes.

207
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Anyway, a tire con chat says that, you know, this is going to continue with super smash brothers ultimate.

208
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You know, these people will find something to bitch about.

209
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Like then like don't throw, throw them out of the arena at Evo, throw them out.

210
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Why are they there?

211
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
If they're going to sit there and boo and they're not enjoying it, then fucking get out.

212
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Leave.

213
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Nobody forced you to go to Vegas.

214
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm sorry, but the stinky cunt gets the douche.

215
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm in that kind of mood.

216
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Why?

217
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Why are you doing this tonight?

218
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Because I'm in that kind of mood.

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If they're going to be...

220
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You can say that.

221
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I can't.

222
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
If I said that, I get angry.

223
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I get death threat tweets.

224
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You can say that.

225
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
If they're going to be cunty, then treat them.

226
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Actually, douches are bad for you.

227
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So honestly, I think it is the worst insult.

228
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Call someone a douche because douches are bad for you.

229
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh my God.

230
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
If any episode ever deserved the explicit tag.

231
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
All right.

232
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Anyhow, let's talk about...

233
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm making up for your Blender on Bobby by making us worse.

234
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Let's talk about some of the less explicit things coming out of EVO because there is

235
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
a lot of news happening.

236
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Playing as Panda.

237
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Okay.

238
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
In Tekken 7.

239
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Oh, the competitor that was doing that?

240
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The Panda was so cute against Devil Jin.

241
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It was so cute.

242
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The Devil Jin guy won, but the Panda player did pretty freaking well.

243
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah.

244
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
All the Tekken 7 hype and all the stuff that's happening around that at EVO and everything

245
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
is kind of reminding me like, oh yeah, Tekken 7 is supposed to be really good.

246
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I need to pick that up at some point.

247
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So I think I probably will because like many of you, I loved Tekken 1, 2, 3, and then kind

248
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
of maybe I looked at 4 and I kind of lost sight of the series.

249
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So I need to come back to it with Tekken 7, which just before we went live tonight, apparently

250
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
they dropped a bombshell on season 2 characters for Tekken 7 and Anna is going to be there

251
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
because you have to have Anna.

252
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Come on.

253
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You have to have Anna.

254
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Negan from The Walking Dead is like their next big crossover, which is...

255
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yeah, I know.

256
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't watch Walking Dead, so I have no idea what that is.

257
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I don't watch Walking Dead.

258
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't watch Walking Dead.

259
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
He's the antagonist that carries the bat with the spikes on it.

260
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Oh, played by, um, what's his face that played the dad on Supernatural.

261
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yes.

262
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Jeffrey Dean Anderson.

263
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah, that's it.

264
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So, him.

265
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And the comedian.

266
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yes.

267
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Is that the guy from Everybody Loves Raymond?

268
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
No, I don't think he's from Everybody Loves Raymond, no.

269
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Or was he?

270
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I don't know.

271
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I just remember him from Supernatural.

272
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Look up his bio.

273
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Jeffrey Dean Morgan.

274
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Now he's the brother from Everybody Loves Raymond.

275
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't know which character he is in Walking Dead because I didn't get to watch that show

276
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
because my wife didn't want to watch The Walking Dead.

277
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
She didn't want to watch, you know, Breaking Bad.

278
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
She wanted to watch House again.

279
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
My mother watches Walking Dead.

280
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
She wants me to watch it.

281
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Or Grey's Anatomy again.

282
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Or God whatever other awful show.

283
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Here's the thing.

284
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't watch it because A, it's on on Sunday nights and there's-

285
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
B, Netflix exists.

286
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yeah, something else going on.

287
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's too violent for me is my honest answer.

288
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You guys know how I feel about the gore of violent stuff.

289
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Like when it's cartoony video game Mortal Kombat 2.

290
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's funny and I can deal with it.

291
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Or like the Happy Tree Friends and stuff.

292
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Even that's a bit much sometimes.

293
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That should be a crossover character for Mortal Kombat.

294
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I can deal with it.

295
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
But like the new Mortal Kombats that are like super realistic.

296
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm like this is-

297
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Oh my God.

298
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Now I really want a Happy Tree Friends fighting game in the style of the latest Mortal Kombat game where it's just ultra violent.

299
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Wasn't there a Happy Tree Friends game years ago?

300
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I thought there was.

301
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I could be wrong.

302
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That was years ago.

303
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Anyway, I don't even think that's a thing anymore.

304
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Anyway, other news out of EVO.

305
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Let's see, DLC character Terry Bogard for fighting EX.

306
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Which is going to be a character in there.

307
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Aria and Sharon teased.

308
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Volcano Rosso and Pullum Perna are coming out between August and September.

309
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I know none of these characters unfortunately.

310
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I don't follow this series at all.

311
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I probably should because I've always had a soft spot for like the stuff that came from SNK and Neo Geo back in the day.

312
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And obviously that's where that all comes from.

313
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Soul Calibur 6.

314
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Now this is more my speed.

315
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I love the Soul Calibur series.

316
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Astaroth and Song Minah are announced that are going to be in the game.

317
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Why don't they just say all the old characters are coming back?

318
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Because I feel like every week we have an announcement.

319
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
How many games has Maxie died in?

320
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Probably all of them.

321
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But the soul is eternal.

322
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
He still has the voice actor he had in the original Soul Calibur 2.

323
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Anyway, I'm super excited about Soul Calibur 6.

324
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'll be checking that out for sure.

325
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
There is a new Guilty Gear game being made.

326
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That is something that was announced as well.

327
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
DOA 6 teased some reveals that are coming up for Gamescom.

328
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But unfortunately they did not announce anything.

329
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
There is thought that during the show later tonight.

330
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So maybe we'll have some breaking news in part B.

331
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Capcom may tease some Street Fighter 5 stuff.

332
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But that would not happen until the top 8.

333
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That is I believe what is happening at EVO right now.

334
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Is the Street Fighter 5 stuff.

335
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So we may hear about that mid-show at some point.

336
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So that would be cool.

337
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Okay, so I did recognize him from Grey's Anatomy unfortunately.

338
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
One of those shows your wife made you one.

339
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I was like...

340
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But he does look very much like...

341
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
There is a comedian that looks kind of like him too.

342
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
That was the brother in...

343
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Everybody Loves Raymond.

344
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yeah.

345
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
No worries.

346
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
There is an update for Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Edition.

347
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That has just hit the Switch.

348
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And if you want to play Dragon Ball FighterZ on Switch.

349
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The open beta is next week.

350
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And SNK Heroines is going to feature a female Terry Bogard.

351
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Which is pretty cool.

352
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So kind of like some gender swapping there.

353
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
But you know we've kind of seen that in some other games before.

354
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So that will be...

355
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Yes and he is much hotter as a female.

356
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It depends on what you're into.

357
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But sure.

358
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Alright.

359
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So anyway.

360
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Lots of talk about fighting games this weekend because of EVO.

361
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What was the last fighting game you got into?

362
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Loki?

363
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You don't really play a lot of fighting games do you?

364
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Last fighting game I played? Jeez.

365
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What about you guys in chat?

366
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What was the last fighting game you super got into?

367
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I don't know.

368
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'd probably say on my arcade cabinet I was playing Marvel vs. Capcom 2.

369
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I mean I didn't really get into like any fighting games like a lot.

370
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yeah that was probably the last one.

371
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I mean.

372
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I may have played.

373
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
No I don't know if I played Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

374
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I did want that one though.

375
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You know what I wish they would release like on Switch.

376
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Or one of these like collection type of things.

377
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Maybe it's been out.

378
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Or Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

379
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I did play that on the Wii.

380
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Did you?

381
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yeah that game was pretty cool.

382
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I want them to bring back Capcom vs. SNK 2.

383
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And I imagine it's like a licensing nightmare.

384
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Which is why that won't happen.

385
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But that's like one of my all time favorite fighting games.

386
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
But I feel like that's a game I want on Switch.

387
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That I'll probably be waiting forever.

388
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
For something like that.

389
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
But that's like one of my all time favorite fighting games.

390
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Is Capcom SNK 2.

391
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So.

392
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah that was pretty good.

393
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And then let's see.

394
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I get into the Soul Calibur series.

395
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So I'll be excited with Soul Calibur 6.

396
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Or I did try to get into Mugen a little bit.

397
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But.

398
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Oh yeah that was the thing you were.

399
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That was like betting wasn't it?

400
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Well salty bet.

401
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yeah that was fun.

402
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But no actually.

403
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
The problem with Mugen is like.

404
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Balancing.

405
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I mean I guess you just don't give a shit about balance.

406
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's just like.

407
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Throw everybody in there and balance.

408
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Whatever.

409
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
There's no fucking way this is ever going to be balanced.

410
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
But I kind of wanted to get into that.

411
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
But more.

412
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You know actually balance it out.

413
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But yeah it's just.

414
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's just too much.

415
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's too overwhelming when you see all the options.

416
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's like I don't know who to put in my roster.

417
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's too many.

418
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Too many people.

419
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's like.

420
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'll put all the fighting.

421
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
All of them.

422
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
All of the characters.

423
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Every single one of them.

424
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Probably the last fighting game I probably played like more than a couple hours of.

425
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Like recently was actually Street Fighter 4.

426
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Like that game kind of still delivers.

427
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Because it's.

428
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's everywhere.

429
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Like remember Street Fighter 4 was a launch title on the 3DS.

430
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Remember that.

431
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I have it on my cabinet.

432
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yeah.

433
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
But then obviously you know it keeps.

434
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
They put it out on PlayStation Plus or something not that long ago.

435
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
One of those.

436
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
The Xbox Gold or something.

437
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So and then it's you know.

438
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's very easy to find a copy of Street Fighter 4.

439
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And that is a very solid fighter.

440
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So I would say that's what it is.

441
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I didn't put that on the Switch.

442
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yeah that is kind of surprising that doesn't exist on Switch.

443
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Maybe they have like some exclusive deal right now with console exclusives for Street Fighter as a whole franchise.

444
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Well no because that Switch just got that massive collection that we just mentioned.

445
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
With the Street Fighter 3 and the alpha and you know that whole bundle.

446
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Yeah.

447
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
About 4.

448
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

449
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
SJ100Matt is talking about FighterZ.

450
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It was a game he got into recently.

451
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I played online and stopped playing.

452
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
People are just insanely tough on there.

453
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Bonds006 says I played me some Marvel vs. Capcom 2 before I came home.

454
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
But SJ100Matt points out Capcom vs. SNK 2 is also up there.

455
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Jamie I didn't really get your opinion on this.

456
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What's like a fighting game series you've recently been into.

457
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Like a fighting game series you like follow, watch or that you've played a lot of.

458
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Because I feel like you probably have collectively played more fighting games than the two of us.

459
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Just with your history.

460
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I was really into Tekken for a long time when I started working at that Amco arcade.

461
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Tekken 3 was my jam.

462
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Tekken 4 I was really into.

463
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Tekken 5 I was really into.

464
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Tekken Tag not so much.

465
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yeah Tekken was really the big one for me for a while.

466
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And then I was also really into like Darkstalkers.

467
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Oh sure.

468
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yeah really into Darkstalkers.

469
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You know that makes me think of Puzzle Fighter.

470
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And even though I guess Puzzle Fighter is something that is represented at EVO.

471
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
EVO is not just like the big fighting games that everybody knows.

472
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But I guess EVO has a lot of tournaments for a lot of little stuff too.

473
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Like I guess they have the Windjammers because that recently came back right.

474
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
So they have a Windjammers tournament there.

475
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But they have a Puzzle Fighter tournament that happens at EVO.

476
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And that is more up my alley.

477
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Like Puzzle Fighter that's a fun game.

478
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Is that Pocket Fighter?

479
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm sure they do but I don't know.

480
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I wish Puzzle Fighter would come back.

481
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And yes I'm well aware of the iPhone Android game.

482
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So I'm going to go back to what I said.

483
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I wish Puzzle Fighter would come back.

484
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I wish that they would do.

485
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Would bring Red Earth out which I knew that that ship has sailed because that should have been Saturn era.

486
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But I'd like to see like a sequel to Red Earth.

487
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I thought you want Arrival Schools.

488
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I really want Arrival Schools.

489
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That was my other jam.

490
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yeah.

491
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I even posted on my Twitter the other day that I still want Arrival Schools game.

492
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You know those are my big things.

493
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And you know Dan and I played a lot of X-Men vs Street Fighter because we had it on Saturn.

494
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Nice.

495
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And then Marvel Super Heroes vs Street Fighter we had that.

496
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Is there anything like recent like some of the recent batches that you've gotten into or do you kind of nothing beats the 2D classics?

497
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I finally got to play Dragon Ball FighterZ.

498
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Oh what did you think?

499
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I really liked it.

500
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It was a little difficult to get used to the moves.

501
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And we're actually even though I have it on Steam I'm going to get the one of the console releases.

502
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I just have to figure out which one we want to get.

503
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
If I get it on Switch I'll have to get another pro controller I guess.

504
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It was really a lot of fun.

505
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yeah.

506
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And but I really think that my big fighting game enthusiasm kind of died out after Marvel vs Capcom 2.

507
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Well you know I honestly like the Dreamcast was like the fighting game console for me.

508
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
That was like all the best 2D fighting games were on the freaking Dreamcast.

509
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And I didn't even I didn't even buy Dreamcast until like Sega had already canned it and they were down to like forty dollars.

510
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
But then it's like I went back and rediscovered all these amazing games.

511
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And even not just the 2D stuff but that's where like Soul Edge was a Dreamcast thing right.

512
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So you know like.

513
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So like Vons006 says Darkstalkers is the new Half Life.

514
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And I was like except there was a third Darkstalkers.

515
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Darkstalkers did get to three yes.

516
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
We have Vampire Savior.

517
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
All right.

518
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
All right well fighting games is fun but I know we play a lot more than just fighting games.

519
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And let's talk about the other games that we have been playing in your gaming week.

520
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
So Darkstalker how was your gaming week?

521
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It was pretty dead.

522
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I've had a really busy week because I'm in training at work.

523
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So I don't know I read the WoW wiki and I read the Injustice 2 wiki.

524
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
To the point that I think Dan and I might have to pick up Injustice speaking of fighting games.

525
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Except I hate DC.

526
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Like none of the characters really interest me but that game really interests me.

527
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Injustice is pretty like the cool thing about Injustice is that it's Mortal Kombat basically.

528
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
But it's not that violent stuff that I was talking about.

529
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It's instead it's superheroes.

530
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And it has a story.

531
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
You know I understand there's a DC versus Marvel thing.

532
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I don't get as into that argument and I love Batman.

533
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
So you know there's always going to be some of the stuff in DC that I'm like into.

534
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's like a new Marvel fighting game.

535
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I think Injustice is a solid franchise.

536
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yeah it doesn't matter how you feel about comic books and stuff.

537
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Like a good game is still a good game.

538
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I like all the character interactions though.

539
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And also that game has my favorite ever version of Harley Quinn.

540
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Because she's still herself but she's moved on.

541
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah.

542
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And really I mean it's just been a lot of pinball lately because we just got the shadow.

543
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And I've been perusing a few things on Steam.

544
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But I haven't really played anything yet.

545
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I need to get my stream setup done.

546
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I was trying to say I need to get my streaming stuff set up.

547
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So I've been slacking.

548
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's been a busy week.

549
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Sure. It happens.

550
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
All right. Loki how about you? How was your gaming week?

551
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I didn't play a whole lot of games because I've been working on programming.

552
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
So I did play.

553
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Well my son's birthday was this week so we bought him a gaming laptop for his birthday.

554
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Probably a big mistake but whatever.

555
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So he has been playing games on there so I did while setting it up.

556
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Check it out because I haven't played it surprisingly enough.

557
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Octodad.

558
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Oh yeah.

559
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
That game is hilarious.

560
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
So we got to play a little bit of that.

561
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
But it's basically setting up Minecraft and stuff for him with mods and everything.

562
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Man Minecraft and mods have really come before I remember trying to get controller support in Minecraft.

563
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It was a pain in the ass.

564
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Now they just have a mod that works with them.

565
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Like jeez this is fucking easier than it was when I had to do this.

566
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So that's kind of cool.

567
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But really didn't play a whole lot other than Pokemon Go this week just because I can't get access to my TV.

568
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
My brand new 4K TV and my PlayStation Pro.

569
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,000
And my brand new copy of Horizon Zero Dawn that's literally had two minutes worth of playtime on it.

570
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So sad.

571
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So I haven't been playing any console games unfortunately.

572
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I did install more Steam games because why not?

573
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Let's make that library bigger of stuff I'm never going to play.

574
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
But I had a bunch of stuff like I was digging through my Humble Bundle library.

575
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Because I was like well I need to get some keys to my son.

576
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Because I gave him a Steam account.

577
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And I was like okay well I'm just going to offload all these duplicate keys that I have.

578
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Which I have like 50 duplicate keys.

579
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It's fucking ridiculous.

580
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So I was going through that and I'm like wait a second.

581
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
This is stuff I haven't read.

582
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I remember purchasing this and I didn't ever redeem it.

583
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So I've been going through that and just adding this to my library since I'm like up to like 560.

584
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Maybe I'll play a game. I'll pick a game to play and just play through it.

585
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You should do that.

586
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Especially when you're on a video gaming podcast.

587
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Playing some games is good.

588
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But whatever.

589
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You know what? My motivation was I need to finish a fucking game.

590
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So everybody can stop saying fake the fucking game.

591
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I was going to, if you would let me finish my sentence before you.

592
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I was going to say but I know you've been spending a lot of time trying to get back into Unity to write games.

593
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Well I'm in. I've kind of left Unity. I'm back in Unreal now.

594
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Oh sorry. But still.

595
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You're working on the thing that everybody criticizes you about.

596
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So I suppose you could be given some credit there.

597
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
But play some more games.

598
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I want to play more games.

599
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Alright.

600
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Anyway.

601
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Let's see my gaming week.

602
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
To be fair. I haven't played a lot of new games.

603
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Because the game I've been still playing most of this week.

604
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
No Man's Sky with the reboot.

605
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
That's exactly it. I want to go back to that too.

606
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Yeah. And honestly. I probably streamed that game like three times this week.

607
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And been continuing my adventures in No Man's Sky.

608
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Learned a lot about multiplayer.

609
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
With how the weird syncing works.

610
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Because I don't think it does server syncing.

611
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I think it's like peer to peer.

612
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Because the only way I was able to see Bobby's base finally.

613
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Which he built on the same planet that I built my base.

614
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
He just built it like across the river.

615
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Is that the only way we could do that.

616
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Is that he started a game.

617
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I joined his game.

618
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
We met on the planet.

619
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And then I could see the base.

620
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And then it stayed.

621
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And actually. Bobby doesn't know this part.

622
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
It did stay behind.

623
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So that when I played off stream.

624
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And I went back to his base.

625
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I got the trophy for visiting a base.

626
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Basically alone.

627
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It's weird though that you would think that we would just update.

628
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
It's just like it hasn't refreshed.

629
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Yeah. But there's no server talk or something.

630
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But there should be. All that's supposed to be persistent.

631
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Well. Here's the thing.

632
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I think maybe the game is very popular right now with the reboot.

633
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And I think a lot of that's struggling.

634
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Because I notice.

635
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Like every time I play the game.

636
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
The little icon for naming services.

637
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Always is like naming services are offline.

638
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Like it's always offline.

639
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So I think the things that I'm naming.

640
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Don't get out there.

641
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I didn't want to name this shitty planet anyway.

642
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Exactly.

643
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Well the funny thing that happened on one stream.

644
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And there's a clip of it over my Twitch channel.

645
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Rob Roberts.

646
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
The funny thing that happened on a stream that really made me lose my shit.

647
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
There was a planet that was like really icy and frozen.

648
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And so I was just joking like.

649
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Oh well I'm going to name this planet Madonna.

650
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Because it's frozen.

651
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Because it's heart's not open. Get it?

652
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So I tried to name the planet Madonna.

653
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And as soon as I hit enter for Madonna.

654
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It came up.

655
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Profanity filter.

656
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
This name has been rejected by the profanity filter.

657
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Madonna is a profane word.

658
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I can't.

659
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I can't name the planet.

660
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I'm like who made this game?

661
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Lady Gaga?

662
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Like what is.

663
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Why can't I name a planet Madonna?

664
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
So I had to name it.

665
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
The second rate Madonna.

666
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Venus Delight.

667
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Which like two listeners will understand that joke.

668
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
So anyway.

669
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It wouldn't take Madonna.

670
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Now I wonder if it's because Madonna.

671
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I mean to be fair.

672
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Does have biblical connotations to it.

673
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But still.

674
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I just found that very weird.

675
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
That it was in the.

676
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It could be something like that.

677
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Or it could be a phonetic filter.

678
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It could be like you know maybe.

679
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Is Madonna a curse word in another language?

680
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Maybe there's like.

681
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I don't know.

682
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Eh.

683
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Go to Madonna.

684
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Is that a.

685
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I don't know.

686
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Curse in another language.

687
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I don't know.

688
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Anyway.

689
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Tiger Claw says.

690
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Maybe the game is preventing you to name planets as celebrities.

691
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
It isn't doing a very good job because I have.

692
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Let's see.

693
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I have.

694
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I have planetary systems named Aisha Tyler.

695
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Beth Ditto.

696
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
We stan Robin.

697
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I.

698
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
There's plenty of.

699
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I have a planet named Vangie.

700
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I'm sure there's probably like 5,000 planets named Miss Vangie or Vangie or some connotation

701
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
of.

702
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But you better believe I have a planet named Vangie out there.

703
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
So I mean you could name things after celebrities.

704
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Madonna is the first one where it said nope.

705
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Oh I don't know.

706
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Bobby Blackwolf trying to give some insight to what's going on saying.

707
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
It's persistent to new players.

708
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
But once you've already visited a planet.

709
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It doesn't try to get new information.

710
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Hmm.

711
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Interesting.

712
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So it's like it downloads the planet the first time you go.

713
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
But then once you kind of like have your own version of it.

714
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It doesn't keep trying to grab it from the server.

715
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Which might be part of how they try to reduce strain on the server since we're not exactly

716
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
playing.

717
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Or paying a monthly fee to.

718
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
To play the game online or anything.

719
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
But I don't know.

720
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yeah whatever.

721
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Yeah.

722
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I mean it's not.

723
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
It's not deal breaking for me because.

724
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I kind of feel that multiplayer is sort of limited anyway.

725
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Like the night that Bobby and I were kind of screwing around on stream and Dungeon Buster

726
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
was there too.

727
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And we were like looking at stuff on the planet like that was fun.

728
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
But I don't think you could really play the whole game that way.

729
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Like I'm not sure that would really work.

730
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Like now we're at a point where like Bobby's kind of at one point in the story.

731
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I'm at one point in the story.

732
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And it's cool that we have this place to converge.

733
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And that's what I like is that oh we have this world where we both have bases so we

734
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
can kind of you know.

735
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
But I actually I used Bobby's base to hide from Sentinels.

736
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Because just on the other side of the hill from Bobby there was some stuff I was mining.

737
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Some hydrogen crystals or something.

738
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And I actually mined so much of it because I have a new multi-tool that does it fast.

739
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
So I mined so much of it that it pissed off the Sentinel.

740
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And I was like oh crap.

741
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And so it's like follow me follow me.

742
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
So I ran into Bobby's base and it finally.

743
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
The worst fucking part of that game is the stupid fucking Sentinels.

744
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I hate that shit.

745
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Yeah.

746
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Well you can kill them.

747
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
But it just.

748
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It'll rate.

749
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Yeah but then it lets.

750
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
You know.

751
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
But there's a lot of quests.

752
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,300
Clean up until you get like super death Sentinels or whatever.

753
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,000
There's a lot of quests that.

754
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I want you to kill Sentinels.

755
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Bobby Blackwell says someone on Reddit tried to name planet Madonna a year ago.

756
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,600
Well I'm sure I'm sure I'm not the first person in history to try to name something Madonna

757
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,840
no man's sky like you know there's other 40 year old gay guys that play this game I'm

758
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,840
sure.

759
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,000
But still like it's just it's the first time I heard of it.

760
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I'm doing something that has nothing to do with video games tomorrow.

761
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Uh dare I ask what is it worthy of mentioning on this show or.

762
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Yeah I'm going to see Sailor Moon Super subtitled in the theater tomorrow night.

763
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Huh.

764
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
That's awesome.

765
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I still haven't seen the Mamma Mia sequel I'm upset.

766
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And Transformers the movie is going to be playing.

767
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I my wife saw the sequel she said it wasn't that great.

768
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I don't always agree with your wife though no no no offense but I don't always agree

769
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
with her opinion on movies and TV and stuff so I'm going to see it anyway.

770
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It doesn't matter like you literally have 20 people tell me it's fucking garbage.

771
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
She and I'm still going to go see she watched that movie room on Netflix yesterday.

772
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Not the room but room totally different right.

773
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
No the one that got nominated for Oscar.

774
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Yes I don't know.

775
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Anyway so that was no man's sky.

776
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And then otherwise I've also been continue to play Pokemon Go.

777
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I'm two thirds of the way through level 38 now so I have six million XP to go before

778
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I'm capped in Pokemon Go.

779
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
So the friends thing has been great for XP even though I'm really bad at sending you

780
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
receiving gifts when I do do it and I've really been trying to get my gifts out there when

781
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I do do it like I've been I've been hitting 10000 XP bonuses like left and right because

782
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I'm getting up to two stars with people and now I'm starting to hit three stars with some

783
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
people like I hit three stars with you this week Loki right.

784
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Yeah that was actually right after the show.

785
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
That was 50000 XP dark soccer and I are like we were probably going to hit it today like

786
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
that that it's hard to tell because it doesn't give you a numerical representation of how

787
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
far along you are.

788
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Yes you can.

789
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Oh how.

790
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So go into your friends thing.

791
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I'm doing this right now.

792
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So go into your friends and then go to whatever friend you want to look at.

793
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
OK.

794
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Well I got to launch my game.

795
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
You keep talking.

796
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I'll do this.

797
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Go whatever friend you look at you tap on the icon that shows the little circles and

798
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'll tell you how many days away you are from reaching your next level.

799
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I had no idea.

800
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Well that makes it easier to know when to pop the stupid lucky egg.

801
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
So let me go.

802
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
So when I go to my friends list and I'm scrolling right now to find dark soccer.

803
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So she's down here.

804
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
There she is.

805
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So I.

806
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Oh OK.

807
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So you tap on the.

808
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Oh play together for two more days to become ultra friends.

809
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So we won't hit it today.

810
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
We'll hit it tomorrow.

811
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Yeah.

812
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Assuming I remember to open her gift after the show that I will.

813
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So that's how you know.

814
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
OK.

815
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Good to know.

816
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Good to know.

817
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
So where am I.

818
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So there's one person above dark soccer that I'm almost.

819
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
This is one of these guys that I played those online survivor games with.

820
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
So he is at one more day.

821
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
So I will hit three stars with somebody today.

822
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So there is that.

823
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
That's cool.

824
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
How long do Loki and I have to go before we hit four stars.

825
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It looks well I have magma lemur who is kind of the furthest along.

826
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
He has 53 more days.

827
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
So I have to accept your gift.

828
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So you and I have 56 more days to be BFF.

829
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Yes.

830
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
My strongest whatever you want to call it friend in the game is one of my friends in Toronto.

831
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Forty six more days.

832
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
So but we have Kyle and I have traded every single day.

833
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Like we have not missed a beat every single day.

834
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,000
He's the first person I send a gift to every day just because he was the most regular at everybody.

835
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So we ended up being like the closest friends.

836
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So that's Pokemon Go.

837
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Kuma JP.

838
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
So we're talking about there.

839
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
All right.

840
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
But but some of you some of the listeners are close.

841
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Act Deft is number two on my list.

842
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And I think as 200 miles like number four behind one of my local friends.

843
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So as 200 Matt and Act after still above Shane on my list.

844
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Shane's at number like six or seven on my list.

845
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So anyway Pokemon Go.

846
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Good times.

847
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Let's get into some other stuff.

848
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I want to get into some like housekeeping and announcements sort of thing.

849
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I do have like a personal announcement.

850
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So I changed my Twitter name after God I've been on Twitter.

851
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
When did Twitter start like 2006.

852
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I've probably been on Twitter since 2006.

853
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And some of you told me not to give up my four letter name.

854
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
But I did it.

855
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I switched my name on Twitter to Mr. Rob Roberts.

856
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
So if you want to follow me on Twitter I'm at Mr. Rob Roberts.

857
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I just didn't feel as strong of a connection to the old name anymore.

858
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Which I haven't really used regularly since the DDR days.

859
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
When I would enter in my high score with a four letter name.

860
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I think due to this show and other podcasts and things I've done.

861
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Was that either friend you again or did you change?

862
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
No because the good news about Twitter is that it just carries it all with you.

863
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
So I didn't lose anybody.

864
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
No I wouldn't.

865
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Oh my God.

866
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
With being on the site that long I would not want to build up from scratch again.

867
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
No way.

868
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
So I did it because everything carries with you.

869
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
But here's the interesting thing.

870
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I tried to snag the old name right back.

871
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And I had two browsers waiting to go.

872
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So I made the change on the first browser.

873
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And then in the second browser I had a new account ready to go to switch to Sky, my old name.

874
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I couldn't do it.

875
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Because it says you cannot have a Twitter name with less than five characters.

876
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So Twitter no longer lets you have short usernames.

877
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
So at least the good news is nobody can have my old name.

878
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:52,000
But the kind of crappy part is that I can't put a placeholder for all those old streams and old episodes of the show where I shouted out my old name.

879
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
It's not going to work.

880
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So that part kind of sucks.

881
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
But I'm trying to look forward not backward.

882
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
So at least my Instagram and my Twitter are unified now.

883
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And so like Snapchat and all that other crap I'll probably try to unify.

884
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So I have all that one name.

885
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
So that'll be that'll be nice.

886
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So there it is.

887
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
So that's my new Twitter name.

888
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Also I want to quickly talk about Dragon Con.

889
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
So we're not going to be here at the end of the month over Labor Day weekend because I'm going to be at Dragon Con.

890
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And I guess I can talk about this now because a lot of the panel schedules or at least, you know, everything is tentative until the show shows up.

891
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
But all the tentative stuff is now out there.

892
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I'm going to be doing eight panels this year at Dragon Con.

893
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And I am really excited about it.

894
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
That's a lot of panels.

895
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
But I love doing panels.

896
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And part of the reason why I'm doing more panels at Dragon Con this year than years past is that not only is the Dragon Con podcasting track having me back, which I'm very thankful for.

897
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And I'm doing some pretty cool stuff with them.

898
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
But also I will be working for the first time with the Dragon Con video gaming track.

899
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
So if you've never been a video, excuse me, if you've never been to Dragon Con, it's like 20 conventions all happening at once.

900
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
They have all these different tracks that have full time programming.

901
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And there's tracks for Star Trek, Star Wars, Whedonverse, British television because British, or Powell from British Invaders, Brian is almost always doing stuff with that track.

902
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Gary from Critical Myth will probably be doing stuff with either the Trek track or the X track, which is some of like the sci-fi modern programming stuff.

903
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Like I went to a Twin Peaks panel on the X track last year.

904
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
So, I mean, there's all sorts of like stuff that all happens at once.

905
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
So I'm working with two tracks this year, whereas every other year I've been to Dragon Con, I've been working with one.

906
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So I'm very happy.

907
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Bobby, I really would not have been able to do it without Bobby finally getting in touch with the gaming track and kind of pushing us to get on there.

908
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
So I'm really excited about it.

909
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So let me tell you some of the panels I'm going to be doing.

910
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I'm going to run through this fast because there's a lot.

911
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
So Friday at 10 a.m., I'm going to be doing a Mass Effect voice actors panel.

912
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Oh my gosh, I'm so thrilled about this one.

913
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Like obviously, you know, I'm a professional, but at the same time, I'm going to fanboy a little bit about Mass Effect.

914
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:06,000
So this Mass Effect voice actors panel, Mark Muir, who's the male voice of Shepard, the voice of Jack, the voice of Legion, all going to be on this panel.

915
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I'm really excited about that one.

916
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,000
7 p.m. Eastern on Friday, over with the podcasting track, going to be doing a panel on live broadcasting.

917
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I only have my short notes for my personal calendar here that I'm looking at.

918
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I'll give you the longer descriptions once the app is out because I would encourage you to download the Dragon Con app if you're going to Dragon Con because it's amazing.

919
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,000
But there's a live broadcasting panel that I'm going to be part of, which, you know, I've been doing live broadcasting thanks to OLR for a little while.

920
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
So we'll have a lot to say there.

921
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Also doing a podcast panel at 10 o'clock on Friday night.

922
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
It is a like Shark Tank style panel for podcasters.

923
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
It's like a pitch your podcast type of thing and we'll give you immediate feedback.

924
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:52,000
So I get to be the, what's his name, the guy that owns the basketball team, Mark Cuban.

925
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I get to be the Mark Cuban of that panel.

926
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Actually, I don't know if I'll be the mean one. I don't know. We'll see.

927
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I'm really, but when it comes to podcasting, I'm very hippy dippy and like everybody should do it.

928
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Everybody should be a podcaster. So maybe I won't be the Mark Cuban.

929
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Saturday is going to be very busy for me, but I'm very excited.

930
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
1 o'clock Eastern over the Westin.

931
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I'm going to be doing a Five Nights at Freddy's sister location live playthrough with voice actors from the game.

932
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Sorry, I'm not the one playing the game.

933
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Because that would have been a recipe for disaster, but that's going to be really fun.

934
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Right after that is done, I have to run back over to the hotel where the podcast panel is doing a broadcasting and podcasting type of thing,

935
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
which I believe, again, I only have my short notes here.

936
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I believe that is a panel about some like the streaming and doing like, you know, again, kind of like live performance stuff.

937
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
4 o'clock Eastern back at the Westin. So I'm literally running back and forth that day.

938
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
There's a Twitch 101 panel. So they're going to have an engineer from Twitch that's actually going to be there.

939
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And I will be moderating kind of like a, how do you do Twitch? Why should you do Twitch?

940
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
You know, kind of all about Twitch, like a Twitch discussion.

941
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
That'll probably be also a great networking panel because I imagine a lot of Twitch streamers,

942
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
probably small up and comers that go to Dragon Con will probably be there wanting to network.

943
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So I'll be right there networking with you all.

944
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,000
And then back on the podcasting track at 7 o'clock Saturday night, a panel on social media.

945
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
So getting on Twitter, Instagram, all the new stuff. There's stuff I haven't even heard of.

946
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I learned about an app called Anchor, which is really big for podcasters, thanks to a panel like this last year.

947
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So that will be a lot of fun. So that is on Saturday.

948
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And then I'm not done yet. Sunday at 4 o'clock Eastern, I'm going to be doing an Overwatch voice actors panel.

949
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I am really excited about this and so thankful to the gaming track staff for letting me, trusting me with this.

950
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
So the voice actresses behind Mercy, D.Va, and Symmetra will be there.

951
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,000
And it's going to take everything in my power to not ask the question, how does it feel to be gay icons, all of you?

952
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Because honestly, I know a lot of gay Overwatch players and they all play D.Va, Mercy, and Symmetra.

953
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So that's going to be fun. I'm really excited about that panel.

954
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
So I think that's it. Did I hit all eight? I think I did.

955
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:20,000
If I didn't, then I haven't put it in my calendar yet, which is probably not a good sign, but I will pick that up.

956
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I feel like I'm missing one from the podcast track.

957
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
No, I have them all. That was eight.

958
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It's busy. It's going to be busy, but I'm really excited.

959
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
So if you're going to be at Dragon Con, find me in the app once they get it listed.

960
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I will be under Attending Professionals so you can find me, Rob Roberts, and you'll be able to see my whole schedule right there in the app.

961
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
And please come by. Please don't be shy. Come up and say hello at any of the panels.

962
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
If your goal is to just say hi to me, I would say go to the ones on the podcasting track.

963
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Just for the fact of the matter is, the room is smaller for podcasting.

964
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
You can imagine these voice actor panels are going to be pretty big, so they'll be using bigger rooms.

965
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It'll be easier to kind of talk to me after one of these other panels.

966
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
But I am really, really, really excited about this.

967
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,000
And in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, sj100matt says, contact Rob through his agent Mr. Smoosh.

968
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Yes, if you would like to.

969
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Mxc says, I wish I were going to Dragon Con. I would love to check out these panels.

970
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Hopefully the podcasting track will do a streaming thing. I know they've done that in years past.

971
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
They live streamed some of it, but I know that was also hit and miss in regards to the quality and stuff.

972
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
So I don't know if they're still doing it, but cross your fingers on your toes, okay?

973
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Some of them get posted to YouTube too, so we'll see.

974
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Anyhow, that's my Dragon Con schedule, so I hope to see many of you Labor Day weekend in Atlanta.

975
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
So enough about me, let's get to some more gaming news.

976
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Loki, what's going on in the world of video gaming this week?

977
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:55,000
The world of video gaming is full of Bitcoin mining and all sorts of garbage.

978
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
So yes, apparently someone snuck a game onto Steam.

979
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I should say snuck because, well it was accepted on Steam, but they snuck a crypto-jacking program in there as well.

980
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:20,000
So the game was called Abstractism, and basically what was happening is that they were noticing that the game is very minimal looking,

981
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
but for some reason their CPUs and GPUs were taxing from the game.

982
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,000
And so people started wondering, well is this a virus? I mean, what's going on?

983
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And so apparently, after looking through the game, they found out that, oh hey, it's a cryptocurrency miner.

984
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So it did end up getting pulled off of Steam, thanks to Valve.

985
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Yeah, thanks.

986
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Once it was pointed out, but the developer of course says, you know, abstractism doesn't mine any cryptocurrency.

987
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Probably you are playing on high graphics settings because they take a bit of CPU and GPU power for the post-processing effects rendering.

988
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Yeah, except the game apparently found that, you know, running on a virtual machine, that the resource usage is unrelated to graphical rendering,

989
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:20,000
as it persisted even when the game is not being rendered, or being rendered by a separate GPU.

990
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,000
So it was a big ol' scam, and it got removed.

991
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Basically they said they removed abstractism and banned its developer from Steam for shipping with unauthorized code, trolling, scamming.

992
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Yeah, how much money did he make first though? Like, how much Bitcoin was he able to mine because of this?

993
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Probably not much, if anything.

994
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Haven't they mined all the Bitcoin by now? Isn't that well dry?

995
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:49,000
It's harder to do it now, and I just don't think that they would have. I mean, this thing looks like it's drawn, like, with a pencil.

996
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I mean, it's very minimalistic, so I can't imagine-

997
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Well, because it's trying to use your processor to mine Bitcoin.

998
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Yeah, I can't imagine that there'd be any pro- like, it just doesn't seem very processor-intensive, so I- it's definitely bullshit, but whatever.

999
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
So at least that's done. Um, and then, you know, there's-

1000
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
More garbage on the Steam store, because they barely moderate it. What a shock!

1001
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Yes! Well, speaking of more garbage on the Steam store, so, there's an issue with, um, fake items, dummy items, masquerading as Team Fortress 2 or Dota 2 rarities.

1002
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And, so what they're doing is, apparently people are sneaking games onto Steam again, as called something else, but they use, like, an icon or items that look exactly like the items that are in, um, Team Fortress 2 or Dota 2.

1003
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:47,000
So when you're looking at them on, you know, the boards to swap stuff, when you're going through that and trying to buy, um, these rare items, you may notice that they look the same, and so you might purchase it by mistake.

1004
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:56,000
So, um, apparently, they're saying that, you know, we started, um, requiring approval for app name changes.

1005
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:06,000
So yeah, what would happen is they'd put it up like, you know, my game is dumb shit, you know, platformer 2, and then, once you get in there, I'm gonna change my name to Team Fortress 2 now.

1006
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Just after it's already on there, and then, you know, fuck with shit.

1007
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Um, so basically, we started requiring approval for app name changes and have more planned to address this sort of problem that we couldn't get done in one day.

1008
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:31,000
We're hoping to have to dismiss two warning dialogues and be sufficient to make people think twice about trades containing forged items, but this is not the end of our response. We'll continue the monitor, of course.

1009
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I just gotta think, you know, with this whole, like, crap that goes on.

1010
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
The Steam store is messy. It is messy.

1011
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Remember how crappy, or like, I didn't think it was that crappy to begin with, Steam Greenlight? I'm kinda wishing we had Steam Greenlight again, because this is bullshit.

1012
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I do too. I just think a lot of changes the store's made in the past few years, it's just, it's a mess. It's a mess.

1013
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:01,000
It's fine if you wanna go grab, like, if you know that, like, Civ 6 is out, and you know exactly where you're going to get it and all that stuff, but as far as, like, discovery and all that, it's a mess.

1014
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And, you know, the whole process before, like, I think the getting rid of the Steam Greenlight was, well, we just don't really wanna vet this stuff anymore, and it's like,

1015
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:19,000
well, we can make a lot more money if everybody is, you know, able to pay us $100 to put any game up, but it, they thought $100 would be a barrier to entry for anybody to put stuff up on the store, but it's not.

1016
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
No, it's not.

1017
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It's no barrier whatsoever, and I think as terrible as Greenlight was, I kinda wish it was back, because this is, it's even worse now.

1018
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Yeah, I agree. And, you know, ST-100 Matt brings up, at least when YYR made a game about shit, he stuck to it and didn't change it.

1019
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Well, you know, speaking of a different game that YYR made, you know, it's, in my opinion, it is still a crime that Super Multitasking is not, like, an all-star game that everybody is talking about.

1020
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Like, and it's because Steam is such a mess, that game probably never gets featured, unfortunately.

1021
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:06,000
It's, it's probably really hard to stick out amongst, you know, it's just, it's just hard to hear about these, like, apps, or these games that are secretly Bitcoin miners and shit, when it's like, you know, there's gems out there, like Super Multitasking.

1022
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Or games that are put up on there, where they're, like, you can't pass the first level, where it's just, like, absolute basic stuff is broken.

1023
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Yeah.

1024
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Or they seem executable, or they, yeah, executable for the game is not included with it, or something ridiculous.

1025
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Rage Nator does point out Greenlight was abused a good percentage of the time, essentially, will give you this $10 game for free if you upvoted on Greenlight.

1026
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I understand that it was, you know, it was abused, but this is far worse now.

1027
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Now, you know, where they don't have to go through that whole step of, like, trying to get people to upvote it, now it's just, I'm just gonna literally shit into the marketplace.

1028
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:48,000
You know, sometimes it could be one game that they've cloned, like, five or six times under different names, and they'll just throw that shit up on there.

1029
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I don't know.

1030
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:59,000
All right. Well, anyhow, let's move on and talk about, you know, when Steam becomes such a mess, you might turn to other ways to get your games, like piracy.

1031
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Just get, don't pirate games, you shouldn't do that, because A.

1032
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
All the time.

1033
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
You need to support developers, and B, you can get banned from your Nintendo system from doing it.

1034
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:17,000
We talked already about the Switch, and how the Switch had made this change, where it's getting a little better at detecting pirated software, and basically banning your Nintendo account.

1035
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Well, guess what happened this week?

1036
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
The 3DS also got a firmware update.

1037
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
That's right.

1038
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:29,000
The firmware update that came out this week on the 3DS, which a lot of people are paying attention to this week, because that new WarioWare game, which I still need to grab.

1039
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
The WarioWare Gold, because I guess it does have new stuff, as well as, like, old stuff, so I'm in if there's new stuff.

1040
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,000
So the new WarioWare game came out on 3DS, so everybody's checking it out, but they have to update their firmware to do it.

1041
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:53,000
3DS firmware update implements this same feature that will detect a pirated game, and if it senses you running it, you will have your Nintendo account and your system banned, because you're a dirty, filthy pirate.

1042
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
So, at least in Nintendo's eyes.

1043
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Not my words, theirs, no.

1044
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Anyway, all seriousness, that is something that Nintendo is really trying to push against.

1045
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Very interesting to see Nintendo ramp up a lot of these efforts recently between not just the Switch firmware, but 3DS firmware.

1046
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,000
We had that story about the ROM sites last week, so it'll be interesting to see what continues, but I know, I know.

1047
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:21,000
What y'all really want to see is, okay, if they're shutting down all this stuff about the classic games, where's their solution for the Switch already?

1048
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Which, hopefully, we will finally know about in the coming months, but who knows?

1049
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I feel like I've been saying that like a broken record for a couple years, so we will see.

1050
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Meanwhile, other big, big things in gaming, Dark Sakura.

1051
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Well, parents want their children to be successful, don't you think? Good parents do.

1052
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I would hope so, yeah.

1053
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:59,000
So there are parents who are hiring video game tutors to teach their kids how to be good at Fortnite and other games.

1054
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:11,000
It was reported by the Wall Street Journal that there are families who have hired tutors to help them get better at video games, charging over $50 an hour for the service,

1055
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:23,000
so that they will be able to attend schools, scholarships, or get scholarships at schools that offer incentive to gamers that join tournament teams.

1056
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,000
And so these parents are investing in their video game skills.

1057
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I don't see a problem with this, but this is basically if you were to kind of draw parallels with any sports type stuff, like football.

1058
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:44,000
It's like people trying to go professional with football and stuff, and training people that way.

1059
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I used to have a private tutor for saxophone.

1060
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Yeah, so I mean, whatever they want to use their money on, as long as they're teaching their kids as well, that listen, you have to have a strong education foundation,

1061
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:07,000
but this might help you get in the door as well, but if this doesn't work out, have this to rely on as well.

1062
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I mean, there's no problem with, if you can get in a football scholarship and go to a really nice school, more power to you, but you gotta have the grades to back that up, too.

1063
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Yeah, I mean, honestly, I don't hate this news, and I'm not gonna make fun of it.

1064
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
If this is something a parent wants to spend money on for their kid, go for it.

1065
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:33,000
And that answer might surprise you guys, because I see a lot of talk on social media kind of poo-pooing this news about,

1066
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
LOL, what kind of parent would hire a tutor for a video game for their kid and all that stuff,

1067
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:45,000
but you gave the exact same example I was gonna give, is that people do it for football, baseball.

1068
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
People do it for competitive sports all the time.

1069
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Pageantry.

1070
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Why not?

1071
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Singing. How many people hire singing coaches, because their son or daughter is gonna be the next American Idol or something?

1072
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Yes and no. I'm gonna separate the arts a little bit differently from competitive sports.

1073
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I don't wanna draw direct parallels, like even though Dark Soccer has had a saxophone tutor and stuff,

1074
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,000
maybe this is just because I grew up band nerd, but I do still feel there is a difference with tutoring in the arts,

1075
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
and that is a very different bubble from this.

1076
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
But this is not the first time I've heard of tutors being hired for competitive sports, and that's what Fortnite is.

1077
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
It's a competitive sport.

1078
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,000
You can't make fun of this, in my opinion, you can't make fun of this, and then in the same breath go,

1079
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,000
but I don't understand why ESPN won't show e-gaming sports.

1080
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
The future is here, people.

1081
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
ESPN is showing that type of stuff now.

1082
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:43,000
The Overwatch League is pushing this ceiling that video games have had when it comes to competitive sports higher and higher,

1083
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
and not just Overwatch League, I mean that's the first thing that comes to mind,

1084
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
but look at EVO getting more and more mainstream stuff, and other gaming things as well.

1085
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:59,000
As our generation, the Generation X and the Millennials and the Zillennials, you know what I mean though?

1086
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
The Zennials.

1087
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Zennials, excuse me.

1088
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,000
But you know what I mean, the generations that are our age, as we all grew up with video games,

1089
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
and as we are getting older and we are making the purchasing decisions for the households and so forth,

1090
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
this is that natural step, is that that type of stuff is now, like,

1091
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Overwatch is as much a competitive sport to enjoy watching as bowling, or the other stuff they show.

1092
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Maybe you should compare it with bowling, because bowling is kind of boring.

1093
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
But, Loki, in all seriousness, it depends on who you are.

1094
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Like, you know, I've known people that were like competitive bowlers.

1095
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
He kind of turned out to be a jerk though, but I mean, I have known people that do that stuff,

1096
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
and if that's what you're into, then cool, you know what I mean?

1097
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Fine, as long as you're not hurting anybody, right?

1098
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:45,000
So, but anyway, I just, yeah, I don't hate this story.

1099
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
As long as, and you know, I think Dark Sakura kind of references too,

1100
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
as long as the kid is going outside, getting fresh air, getting vitamin D,

1101
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
interacting with other kids, doing the other things,

1102
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
then honestly, I see no difference between this and football coaching.

1103
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Except the fact that, yes, football coaching is more physical in nature,

1104
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,000
but Fortnite is mental, I suppose, mental activity.

1105
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Chess coaching.

1106
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
And I'm not, sure, chess coaching.

1107
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
And I'm not saying, hold that kid up inside all day.

1108
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Let the kid go outside and play in the mud.

1109
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
That's what kids do, you know, let the kid go outside and play in traffic.

1110
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
No, just kidding, don't do that, but you know what I mean.

1111
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Let them go outside and be kids too.

1112
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I'm sure there are going to be stage parent horror stories in Fortnite,

1113
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
but again, all these other things we named have them too.

1114
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Well, the other thing that's kind of unique about Fortnite

1115
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
and like other games of the like are,

1116
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
they're probably not going to be around forever either.

1117
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I mean, just because Fortnite's popular right now,

1118
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
next year could be a whole other game.

1119
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
So don't get necessarily focused on one game,

1120
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
just become better at gaming altogether.

1121
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Okay, go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1122
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Dungeon Buster says,

1123
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I remember when people were looking for tutors when Age of Empire was huge.

1124
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
So it's always something.

1125
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Let's see, S2100Matt says,

1126
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I hope those tutors are teaching kids to be good people online as well.

1127
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I also hope the tutor teaches the kids how to properly balance gaming,

1128
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
school, work, and other real life things as well.

1129
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Well, I would hope good sportsmanship is a part of that tutor

1130
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
because this may shock you guys.

1131
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
You may not know this about me,

1132
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
but when I was a kid, I played soccer for many years.

1133
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Apparently, I was pretty good at being a goalie.

1134
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
So I did soccer from the time I was like five

1135
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
until probably I left it behind to join band when I was 12.

1136
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
So I played soccer for a very long time.

1137
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
And a good coach is going,

1138
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
as I had many coaches during those years when I played soccer,

1139
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
a good coach is going to teach you about good sportsmanship

1140
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
and that, you know, when you lose a game,

1141
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
you don't fucking like yell at the other team and stuff.

1142
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
You still shake their hand and say, good game.

1143
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,000
So again, a similar parallel to what already exists in our society

1144
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
when it comes to other sports and things like that.

1145
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, some other comments.

1146
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Let's see, Bobby Blackwell says,

1147
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I watched a competitive cornhole tournament a few weeks ago.

1148
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
You know, the game you play at tailgates

1149
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
where you throw the bag into the hole.

1150
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
It was on ESPN, not 2 or the Ocho.

1151
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
No, that is a legit thing. I was at a bar last week.

1152
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I was actually convinced to go to a straight bar,

1153
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
which doesn't always happen, but I went

1154
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
and they were playing that cornhole game.

1155
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
And that wasn't the first time I'd heard about it either

1156
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
because I actually was looking into this whole thing

1157
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
where like locally they have these different sports leagues.

1158
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
I felt like I found it on Reddit.

1159
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Somebody was asking about things to do in town on Reddit

1160
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
and somebody suggested like, well, if you want to meet people,

1161
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
this sports league is really popular.

1162
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
And I don't remember the name of it,

1163
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
but it basically like they have the stuff you would expect

1164
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
to see like a neighborhood softball.

1165
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I don't think you do baseball with softball team

1166
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
or maybe it's T-ball, one of those things

1167
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
or a neighborhood bowling is always a big thing with that.

1168
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
But they actually had like, you know, a cornhole thing.

1169
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
And I was like, what the fuck is cornhole?

1170
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
And I actually did.

1171
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
And then it was like not even like a few days

1172
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
after reading that on Reddit.

1173
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Then I actually saw people playing it at this bar

1174
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
and I was like, oh, they're playing that game

1175
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I was reading about, which is you throw a bag into a hole

1176
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,000
and it's not like the sport exists basically.

1177
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
So that sport exists for people that maybe

1178
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
they just want to be there for the social aspect

1179
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
and, you know, play a game that's less strenuous,

1180
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I suppose, than maybe something like ice hockey.

1181
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
You know what I mean?

1182
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
So, yeah. Yeah. Why not?

1183
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I mean, golf, it's kind of a lot of you do walk.

1184
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
You do walk a lot in golf.

1185
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
You have to, you know, you don't.

1186
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
True, true. All right.

1187
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Bobby Bockel says it's huge at tailgating.

1188
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Yes, it's a branded beanbag toss.

1189
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
It sure is.

1190
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I'm pretty sure this thing I was looking at at the bar

1191
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
was one of the beer companies was sponsoring it.

1192
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
So that's that's the thing.

1193
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
So anyhow, there you go.

1194
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Wow. All these different talks on sports,

1195
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
all because of tutors in Fortnite.

1196
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
But Fortnite is just that big of a deal right now.

1197
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
It's the game of the moment, you know?

1198
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Yes.

1199
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
All right.

1200
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I the one I guess the one element and then I promise to move on.

1201
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
The one element, though, is that you also don't like half,

1202
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
even though I'm not like laughing at this news and saying this is stupid.

1203
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Like at the same time, you don't have to hire a tutor.

1204
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Just play Fortnite a lot.

1205
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,000
And and if you're a parent, get involved with your kid playing Fortnite.

1206
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Watch them, cheer them on, support them,

1207
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
help them notice some of the things on the screen.

1208
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Maybe they're missing.

1209
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Well, I think that these parents are doing that because that's why

1210
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
they're doing the tutoring is because they are playing with them

1211
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
and they want them to be better.

1212
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I don't know. I just hope it's not like they want them to get good.

1213
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Yet you brought up the pageant thing.

1214
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
And you know, a lot of kids get involved in those pageants

1215
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
because it's, you know, mom living out her fantasy.

1216
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
I don't think so.

1217
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
They're like, I mean, I am sure that there's some instances where,

1218
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
like, you know, somebody might be convincing someone to play something.

1219
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
But I think it's just more like encouraging them with what they want.

1220
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
They see, you know, it's just like myself, like he wants to be a YouTuber

1221
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
because he watches YouTubers.

1222
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
It's like if someone's watching Twitch streamers of Fortnite players,

1223
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
they're going to want to be a Fortnite player

1224
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
because that's what they watch is what they want to do.

1225
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
So you just have to support them.

1226
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
And then eventually they'll either stick with it or they'll grow out of it.

1227
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I wanted to be in construction and engineering.

1228
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
My wife would have preferred if I went into engineering.

1229
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I did not go into engineering because I'm, you know.

1230
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,000
This is a struggle that lasts until college, okay?

1231
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,000
I went to college and originally I was doing computer science and I hated it.

1232
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,000
And then I got into, I was going to be a weatherman on TV.

1233
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,000
And I interned at a CBS station in the town where I went to school

1234
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
and all this stuff.

1235
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
And as much as, like, I learned a lot from the experience,

1236
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I also learned from that experience.

1237
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
This is absolutely not what I want to do.

1238
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Like, now that I've seen the reality of what goes into, I do not want to do this.

1239
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
You don't want to go stand in the hurricane?

1240
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
It's just, it's a lot more depressing.

1241
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
My friend's dad is actually a hurricane chaser.

1242
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Yeah.

1243
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
And that's, you know, I'm not going to bash the people that do it.

1244
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
It's actually quite the opposite.

1245
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Like, I realized I don't have the strength and the self-esteem

1246
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
to handle something like that.

1247
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
You know what my original major was before I changed it to Japanese?

1248
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Forensic geology.

1249
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Oh, wow. That's kind of cool.

1250
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
And I decided rocks are boring.

1251
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:42,000
But at the same time, like, A, the day job that I do have as a corporate trainer,

1252
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
like, I love it. It's awesome.

1253
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
And I feel like, you know, cool.

1254
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
I found this not through school, but through working my way up into it.

1255
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
And that's awesome.

1256
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
And B, you know, it's not that the broadcasting stuff I learned in college

1257
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
went completely to waste because, look, here we are.

1258
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Like, you know, and I can say, I'm using my quoting fingers.

1259
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I built this, obviously, with Jamie and Loki,

1260
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
but I can still look at it and go, as opposed to, like, you know,

1261
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
something where it had to be done on somebody else's terms,

1262
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
reporting to somebody else and ratings and all this other stuff,

1263
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I can look at this and go, but no, we have this,

1264
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,000
and this is something that I helped build, and we do it by our rules.

1265
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
You know what I mean?

1266
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
But I do wish we had the ratings.

1267
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Well, you know what, there came a point a long time ago

1268
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
where I just kind of realized if that was going to happen,

1269
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
it would have happened, and it hasn't, but that's okay.

1270
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
You know what, though, Loki?

1271
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
But, like, there's that, but at the same time, like, you know,

1272
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
it's taken a long time, but, like, the fact that I'm doing these panels

1273
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
at Dragon Con is pretty amazing.

1274
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Not everybody gets to do that.

1275
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
So, like, I'm thankful for that. I'm super thankful.

1276
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Okay, so I'm not PewDiePie, but who would want to be him?

1277
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
He's an asshole.

1278
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
But you know what I mean?

1279
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Like, with the spotlight can also come a lot of that negativity

1280
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,000
of where everything you do is scrutinized type of thing.

1281
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
You know, maybe not the best name for me to throw out there

1282
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
because he deserved to be scrutinized for some of those things that he did,

1283
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
but you know what I mean?

1284
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Like, I also really like my privacy.

1285
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Like, you know, sure, Sunday night we do this show.

1286
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
We have our small little audience.

1287
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I love you guys.

1288
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
We're a great little family here on Sunday nights and so forth

1289
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
and throughout the week with the podcast feed.

1290
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I don't want to leave you guys out either.

1291
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:32,000
That's all fantastic, but y'all are nice and respectful of my privacy.

1292
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I like that. You know what I mean?

1293
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Knock on wood, I'm not getting death threats.

1294
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,000
And unfortunately, that's some of the stuff that comes with getting bigger.

1295
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,000
When we were at our peak, when iTunes first launched podcasting

1296
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
and we were one of only a handful of video game podcasts

1297
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
the day that iTunes launched podcasting in the store,

1298
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
we did have to taste a little bit of that unfortunate side.

1299
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Like, people at dark soccer, you got it worse than anyone

1300
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
because unfortunately, you're a girl gamer.

1301
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
And fuck all those idiots. I don't give a shit what they think.

1302
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Well, guess what? You're still here.

1303
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Where are they?

1304
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
They're not.

1305
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
They're not?

1306
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
They have their kids and they've been punished.

1307
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Guess who doesn't have kids?

1308
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Anyway, let's see.

1309
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Bobby Blackwell says, hey, at least you're not interviewing Billy Mitchell.

1310
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Bobby Blackwell has seen his variety.

1311
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
I would totally want to interview him because I don't give a shit about him

1312
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
and that's the best kind of mentality to have.

1313
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
That's why you don't get to interview him.

1314
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Here's the thing.

1315
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Oh, come on.

1316
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Here's the thing.

1317
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I ask the hard-hitting questions.

1318
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Remember, Konami, Jason Enos?

1319
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Here's the thing. Here's the thing.

1320
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,000
As much as Bobby has kind of taken a few licks over that whole interview

1321
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
and the article and everything,

1322
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:52,000
at the same time, it is a perfect example of all publicity is good publicity

1323
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
because it did get...

1324
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Now Bobby gets to say, as seen on Variety,

1325
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Bobby gets to say he was at that infamous panel with Billy Mitchell.

1326
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Bobby got invites to other shows he probably wouldn't have been a part of

1327
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
if he hadn't done that because he got that publicity.

1328
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
You know what I mean?

1329
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
So he's growing his own networking from that.

1330
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
So, I mean, yes, was it probably difficult for him in some ways?

1331
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I'm sure it was to read some of that negativity and stuff,

1332
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
but at the same time, I still think he's emerged from that whole experience

1333
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,000
bigger as a name than he was before.

1334
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
So, anyway.

1335
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Let's see.

1336
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Other comments in chat at live.vognetwork.com.

1337
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Oh, well, this is depressing.

1338
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I hate to interrupt.

1339
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
There's horrible dead celebrity news.

1340
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Are you ready for this, DarkSakura?

1341
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I dropped my phone.

1342
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
The guy that played Cornelius Fudge died?

1343
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
No, this is worse.

1344
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
That he did, though.

1345
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
This is worse.

1346
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Charlotte Rae, also Mrs. Garrett on The Facts of Life and Different Strokes,

1347
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
passed away, but 92.

1348
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Well, he was also 92.

1349
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Yeah.

1350
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
So, I mean, bless her heart.

1351
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
So that's unfortunate.

1352
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:08,000
And y'all know I grew up on The Facts of Life.

1353
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Well...

1354
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I saw a lot of myself in Joe.

1355
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I don't know what it was, but...

1356
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Betty White sacrifices yet another to take her place.

1357
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
So...

1358
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Alright, anyhow.

1359
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Well, rest in peace, Charlotte Rae, who, of course, I loved,

1360
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
loved The Facts of Life growing up, so that's depressing.

1361
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Anyway, let's move on.

1362
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
We do have some more video game news.

1363
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
More Fortnite stuff, right, Logie?

1364
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Ah, yes.

1365
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:37,000
So, Fortnite will not be coming to your neighborly Google Play Store

1366
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:43,000
because they take 30% of the in-app purchases for games sold through their storefront.

1367
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
And, as Epic would put it,

1368
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
the 30% tax is a high cost in a world where game developers,

1369
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:58,000
70% must cover all of the costs of game developing, operating, and supporting their games.

1370
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
And this is from Tim Sweeney.

1371
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
And basically saying that what they're going to do instead is

1372
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
they're going to maintain a direct relationship with their consumers.

1373
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,000
They're going to have a stand-alone installer for the Android version of the game.

1374
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Which, you know, being that they are on that platform,

1375
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
and, you know, to the benefit, I guess, of Android users,

1376
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
that it's an open marketplace, so you don't have to use the Google Play Store if you don't want to,

1377
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
unlike Apple and their closed marketplace where they have to go through that.

1378
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
They can, I guess, do that.

1379
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
So...

1380
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Well, I guess it's a good way to get around the 30%.

1381
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Yeah, right.

1382
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I mean, it's kind of diabolical in some ways.

1383
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,000
It's not like, you know, yeah, I mean, because they're a big enough game where it's like,

1384
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
we can do whatever the fuck we want. We don't need your fucking advertising.

1385
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
We're Fortnite, bitch.

1386
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
We're Fortnite, bitch, yeah. Exactly.

1387
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
All right.

1388
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Going to chat at live.vognetwork.com.

1389
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Bobby Blackwell says,

1390
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:59,000
The worry here is that everyone has to turn on developer tools to sideload the app,

1391
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
and that leaves a lot of unprotected phones for malware.

1392
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
People like Loki and I already have that turned on,

1393
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
but you are potentially exposing your phone to other threats by doing that,

1394
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
especially when we're talking about that there are kids that play Fortnite,

1395
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
as we just heard in the last story.

1396
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Yeah.

1397
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
So, that is an unfortunate side effect to all that,

1398
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,000
so hopefully Epic will kind of have some responsibility in kind of educating people,

1399
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
since they are going around the store and they are such a big game,

1400
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:31,000
on how to prevent from getting malware and that stuff on your phone.

1401
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Or maybe, can you open it and then close it?

1402
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Can you open it, grab the game, then close it?

1403
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Does that work?

1404
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Right, but then anytime you push something to it though,

1405
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
like updates and stuff, they may need to do it again.

1406
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I don't know.

1407
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
It's hard to say how they're going to have it set up.

1408
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
They could have it where they just install it

1409
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,000
and it installs other supplemental files without permissions.

1410
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I don't know.

1411
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
I don't know.

1412
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
All right.

1413
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Well, let's shift gears here a little bit and talk about some Bioware news.

1414
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,000
And you all know that I've been a little salty when it comes to things Bioware,

1415
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
because of what happened with Mass Effect.

1416
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
You have me both.

1417
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Yeah, I know Jamie's right there with me.

1418
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:13,000
But some interesting comments in a new blog from Casey Hudson,

1419
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
who's the boss of Bioware now,

1420
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
who of course was the big name behind the Mass Effect trilogy.

1421
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Interesting in the Midsummer update, he went on to say,

1422
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:26,000
We hear loud and clear the interest in Bioware doing more Dragon Age and Mass Effect.

1423
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
So rest assured that we have some teams hidden away

1424
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
working on some secret stuff that I think you'll really like.

1425
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
We're just not ready to talk about it for a little while.

1426
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Will we get our Quarian DLC for Andromeda, please?

1427
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Sadly, I don't think that's going to happen.

1428
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
What about the remaster?

1429
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Do you think that might come?

1430
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
The other thing I was thinking of is that, you know,

1431
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
that thing that I thought would have happened between Mass Effect 3 and Andromeda,

1432
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
a multiplayer mode spin-off, basically,

1433
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
because the multiplayer mode in Mass Effect is pretty darn good.

1434
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
I think 3 was a little better than Andromeda's,

1435
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
but Andromeda's wasn't bad by any means.

1436
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,000
So it would be interesting if maybe they expanded on that with another multiplayer game,

1437
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
which would certainly meet all of the soul-sucking EA needs

1438
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
of microtransactions and loot boxes and all that shit.

1439
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Whatever. You could do enough in those games without ever buying a single treasure box.

1440
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
You could if you wanted to.

1441
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I know sometimes we did with leftover currency and what have you from Origin,

1442
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
but, I mean, at the end of the day, you could do a lot in those games without buying the dumb boxes.

1443
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
So, I don't know. What do you think, Jamie?

1444
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Do you think they're maybe working on a full new Mass Effect game,

1445
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
or do you think maybe it's some silly side story or what?

1446
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I have no idea as long as it's just not fucking Anthem.

1447
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
And not a mobile phone game.

1448
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
If it's a mobile phone game, fuck right off.

1449
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Now, Mass Effect Mobile was very good

1450
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
when it was like the galaxy map thing that interacted with the game.

1451
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
That was cool.

1452
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
But if it's like, oh, we've got this brand new Mass Effect game,

1453
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
but it's a mobile phone, fuck off.

1454
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Please don't let me near that announcement.

1455
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
I don't know if we'll see microtransactions in a new Mass Effect game

1456
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
just because they're making so much off of their sports game titles.

1457
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
I don't know if you read this week, there was some guy that was in Europe

1458
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
that part of their new law or whatever, the privacy laws,

1459
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:17,000
they can request information from any company that's collecting data on them

1460
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
to see what kind of data they have.

1461
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,000
And he looked at his purchases for FIFA, the boxes and stuff.

1462
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,000
He spent over 16,000 euro in the last two years on that stuff

1463
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:34,000
because he has that kind of expendable income.

1464
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
I never want to see my receipts from Pokémon GO.

1465
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I never want to see how much I've spent on Pokémon GO

1466
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
because I will be so upset and mad.

1467
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:54,000
But that's, you know, they're making 16,000 off of one person.

1468
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I mean, granted, that is an outlier.

1469
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
They're making bank.

1470
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,000
And so they don't need to put the same face in some of the other games,

1471
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
but I don't know. It's still sickening.

1472
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
All right. Well, let's move on with some more news

1473
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
about some things we know are happening based on footage, right, Jamie?

1474
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Yes. I'm sure our Persona fans will be super thrilled with this.

1475
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:20,000
The next RPG that's coming out is Persona Q2 New Cinema Labyrinth.

1476
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,000
They just had a new trailer come out that released some details.

1477
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:29,000
So cast from past three of the mainline games are going to be coming in.

1478
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
It actually has a little chibi version of the Persona 5 Phantom Thieves.

1479
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
So it fits the whole style.

1480
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:41,000
And then there are going to be new characters thrown into it as well.

1481
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:47,000
They also showed that you can have the party made up of three main protagonists.

1482
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:52,000
And that you can also see the Persona 3 protagonist casting a spell

1483
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
with Persona 5-style graphics.

1484
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
And so it's just interesting stuff.

1485
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,000
But I'm sure all of our Persona fans are going to be completely thrilled about this.

1486
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Of course, as we know, Persona is a spinoff of the Shin Megami Tensei games.

1487
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
So enjoy.

1488
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
I wish I got more into the Persona games.

1489
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Like, they have their fans and they love them.

1490
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:20,000
But I'm just, oh my god, it's so many hours of game. You know what I mean?

1491
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I have some of the Saturn ones that I got off Etsy not too long ago.

1492
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Haven't played any of them.

1493
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Speaking of Shin Megami Tensei, I was told that there is a new mobile phone game,

1494
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Shin Megami Tensei Liberation DX2, that's now available.

1495
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
And that we should check that out.

1496
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Make it so.

1497
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Make it so. Maybe I will. I will do that.

1498
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Alright. Let's move on.

1499
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Talk about a few more stories before we get to the classic peripheral of the month.

1500
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Loki.

1501
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Hey, there's a new console coming. I bet you didn't expect that.

1502
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
This is a console that's not from one of your normal console makers.

1503
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:02,000
This is actually a collaboration between AMD and a Chinese company called Zhongshan's Sabur.

1504
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:07,000
And they're creating a custom console hardware for the Chinese market.

1505
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Now, spec-wise, it's kind of similar to a Playstation 4 Pro.

1506
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
It's going to be using Ryzen as well.

1507
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,000
It's basically a system on a chip that's Ryzen and the RX Vega.

1508
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:23,000
And it's going to, like I said, spec-wise, it's pretty similar to the Playstation Pro.

1509
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
They've got 8 gigs of GDDR5.

1510
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:34,000
They're saying that they're not using DDR4 RAM.

1511
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,000
But it's basically going to be similar to the setup of the Playstation 4.

1512
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:46,000
The system on the chip, they've got 24 compute units, 1.3 gigahertz for 3.99 teraflops of GPU power.

1513
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
And I've got to say, though, they do have a picture of what the console looks like.

1514
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
It's sexy-looking.

1515
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
But I'm kind of curious to see, though, what the hell this is going to be used for.

1516
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Because such a powerful console, what's going to be on it?

1517
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Well, unfortunately, it's not a Playstation 4.

1518
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
But the good news is, it's just going to be copies of PS4 games.

1519
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
I'm kidding.

1520
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
They did say, though, they're also going to release the console.

1521
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,000
There's going to be a version of the console that's just a computer, like a PC.

1522
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
But they're going to have actual games for it, though.

1523
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
But I'm kind of curious to see what this is.

1524
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
I'd be kind of curious to find out what's going to be running on this thing.

1525
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Yeah, you always wonder, is there going to be a big game that's on one of these consoles?

1526
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Man, I want to play that. Bring that out over here.

1527
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Yeah, so check it out and see what the pricing is and go from there, I guess.

1528
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Well, the wait.

1529
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
In chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Rama says,

1530
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Hold up, Ryzen? Bro, that's leaps and bounds over Playstation 4 Pro.

1531
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Tigerglass says, I've been hearing a lot about those Ryzen CPUs.

1532
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
They are powerful, but not as powerful as Intel, though.

1533
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
And here's the thing.

1534
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Again, though, the whole golden rule of gaming, though,

1535
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
is the system is only as good as the games that are on it.

1536
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:04,000
But you did open the door there with the hole, but they have this PC type of build.

1537
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
That makes it a little bit different, I suppose.

1538
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
But otherwise, it could have all the teraflops at once.

1539
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
If the games are shitty, it's not going to matter.

1540
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
You know what I mean?

1541
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Right, I have no idea.

1542
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Because, I mean, China is just getting into the console market.

1543
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Because up until quite recently, they were banned from being over there.

1544
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,000
So it is kind of curious to see that we may have another contender.

1545
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
And that's kind of funny, because even in the mobile space now,

1546
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,000
we've got contenders for mobile phones that are these Chinese companies

1547
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
that no one's ever heard of.

1548
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
And all of a sudden, they're like, oh, hey, these phones fucking kick ass.

1549
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,000
So it's interesting to see what happens out of this.

1550
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
All right, well, we'll see when maybe some games get announced for this.

1551
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Who knows?

1552
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
A game that has been announced that I know a lot of us are excited to play

1553
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,000
is Pokemon Let's Go, the upcoming Switch spinoff game

1554
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
that kind of combines the traditional Pokemon RPG

1555
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,000
with some of the features from the Pokemon Go mobile game.

1556
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Apparently, there's going to be a big change when it comes to shinies,

1557
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
because you will be able to see shinies on the map.

1558
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:15,000
But it's not quite as easy as necessarily like, oh, there is a Pikachu

1559
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
that is a slightly darker brownish type of color.

1560
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
That's not quite how it works.

1561
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,000
What it is is basically a shiny Pokemon doesn't look different

1562
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
than other Pokemon in the overworld when it appears,

1563
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:32,000
but a small glimmer, an aura, gives a player a chance to know

1564
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
that the Pokemon they're looking at is shiny.

1565
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:40,000
That is kind of a little hint maybe that this Pidgey is a little bit special.

1566
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,000
It's got something that might be a little different.

1567
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Which, again, when it comes to shiny Pokemon, at least in most of the games,

1568
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
especially in Go, it means literally nothing.

1569
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
It's a different color. That's it.

1570
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
It's a different color that's much more rare than the standard one.

1571
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
So does it mean anything in the other games too?

1572
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Well, we don't know about Pokemon Let's Go.

1573
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Well, like in the other games.

1574
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
No, not the new ones.

1575
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I think in the old Gen 2 or Gen 3, and chat, correct me if I'm wrong,

1576
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,000
but I want to say there was something about the stats with shinies

1577
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
would be a little bumped, but I don't think they continued that

1578
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
in the more recent games.

1579
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
That kind of went away.

1580
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
So now it's just, oh, they're just a slightly different color,

1581
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
and they're really rare, but that doesn't mean people don't obsess

1582
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
about collecting them.

1583
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Obviously, we've all joked about our friend Shane,

1584
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,000
who used to do the Pokestop podcast here at VOG Network.

1585
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
He loves to collect shinies.

1586
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
By the way, he does this in Go.

1587
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
He collects shinies in Go. Why?

1588
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Because they're shiny.

1589
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
When you trade people's shinies, do they stay shiny?

1590
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,000
They stay shiny, but they won't keep the stats.

1591
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Just like any other Pokemon when you trade them.

1592
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,000
And it can be very expensive to trade a shiny that you don't have

1593
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
if you're not at least three-star friends with the other person.

1594
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
If you're only at one star, it's a million stardust

1595
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
to get a new shiny in your decks.

1596
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
So, anyway.

1597
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1598
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Let's see.

1599
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Oh, I guess there's still comments on the system.

1600
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
They're having arguments about who makes the better chipsets in there.

1601
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
So, Fifth Dream says,

1602
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,000
it just tells what stats they have, but they're not even great stats.

1603
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
So, SG100Matt says,

1604
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,000
yep, gen one through three stats were better in the early games.

1605
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Now they're just color variants.

1606
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Yeah, that's what I kind of thought was the case there.

1607
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Anyway, November 16th, you can start to collect shinies and more

1608
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
in Pokemon Let's Go.

1609
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
I know I'm very much looking forward to that game.

1610
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Yeah, the game does look awesome.

1611
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I'm actually looking, I'm very excited for it.

1612
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
I haven't really played any actual mainline Pokemon games,

1613
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
so it'd be very interesting to check it out.

1614
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Yeah.

1615
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
And what was it, we have like, I think,

1616
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I don't think we're talking about, but in a couple weeks,

1617
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I want to say that the rumor is

1618
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
that there's going to be some sort of evolution fest in gen four in Pokemon Go.

1619
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Yeah, that rumor's been circulating for a bit.

1620
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
I've been sock piling candy,

1621
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
just because I don't want to

1622
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
evolve this crap that I have.

1623
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Yeah, like an evolution event that would introduce some of the gen four Pokemon.

1624
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I know that's something, I know there's a lot of rumors about PvP,

1625
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
because I guess something came out of one of the Ingress events

1626
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
that happened last weekend.

1627
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
There was an interview with a Niantic representative at the Poland event.

1628
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Warsaw was one of the sites for an anomaly.

1629
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
And there was an interview with a Niantic rep there who said,

1630
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
basically flat out, that they're trying to get PvP done this year.

1631
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
So that's something, that's like the next big thing for Pokemon Go.

1632
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,000
But it's with every gen that's hit the game,

1633
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
something huge hit with it.

1634
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Like gen three gave us the weather boosting.

1635
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Gen two was, was that the gym redesign?

1636
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Would gen two hit?

1637
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I think so. So maybe gen four is going to be PvP.

1638
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I don't know. So we'll see.

1639
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I mean, the friends list was already kind of a big

1640
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
frickin' change to the game.

1641
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
And the gifting and all that stuff.

1642
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
So I don't know. Alright.

1643
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Anyhow, let's go to a more classic time in gaming.

1644
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
When you couldn't collect any shinies, they didn't exist.

1645
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
It's the classic peripheral of the month, because once a month,

1646
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Dark Sakura mixes it up a bit and not only says,

1647
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
here's a game that you should be checking out,

1648
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,000
but hey, here's a little peripheral, something that helps you play games,

1649
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
that you may have never heard of.

1650
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
And this one is, yeah, very much...

1651
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
It's not even playing a game, really.

1652
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Yeah, this is an interesting one you picked this month,

1653
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
but I like it. What is the classic peripheral of the month?

1654
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I picked, as it was known in the US,

1655
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
the Singer Isaac sewing machine.

1656
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
For Game Boy.

1657
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Yes. For Game Boy.

1658
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,000
In Japan, it was released as the Jaguar JN 100,

1659
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
which was about $600 when it was released.

1660
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Um...

1661
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
It, um, I just picked general Game Boy games.

1662
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Game Boy music? That's fine.

1663
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
So anyway, it was a sewing machine

1664
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,000
that would hook up to a Game Boy cartridge

1665
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,000
that was called Rakuraku machine,

1666
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
which is sewing machine, is what it was called.

1667
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
We actually got this in the US,

1668
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
because they marketed this in the US

1669
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
as the Singer Isaac for Game Boy.

1670
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,000
There's sites that are selling them for about $400.

1671
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:22,000
You can get a full Jaguar Nintendo sewing machine

1672
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,000
for $1400 on eBay, by the way.

1673
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,000
I just happened to double check a finished auction on it.

1674
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,000
But anyway, with the Game Rakuraku machine,

1675
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
it had different embroidery patterns

1676
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
that you could create on there,

1677
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
and then you would save them,

1678
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
plug the cartridge in on the sewing machine,

1679
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
and it would do the embroidery for you.

1680
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
And as this, you know, kept going,

1681
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,000
they actually did other versions of this machine in Japan.

1682
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Now, of course, we got the one, the Isaac,

1683
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,000
but the other ones that came out overseas

1684
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
were different models.

1685
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
There was the JN-2000.

1686
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
It had an improved model that used

1687
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
a different external embroidery attachment,

1688
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,000
and it was very quick.

1689
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
There were other games that came out

1690
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,000
that would use this embroidery attachment,

1691
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000
including one called Mario Family,

1692
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,000
which was a game where it had just different Mario...

1693
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I would probably say Mario World era,

1694
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
because it was Game Boy Color stuff,

1695
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:36,000
that would let you do different kinds of embroidery patterns.

1696
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
They tested a Kirby one.

1697
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:43,000
There is video of it in use on the Kirby one.

1698
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:48,000
They only showed it at one of the consumer electronic shows in Japan.

1699
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:54,000
The other thing, too, is that this machine would also do text.

1700
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:59,000
It would do kanji, I think, up to 500 characters.

1701
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Hiragana, katakana, and romaji, which is English letters.

1702
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:09,000
And then, of course, there were no follow-ups past that.

1703
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:14,000
It was pretty popular with some of the niche market.

1704
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
In the US, people were like,

1705
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
oh, this is cool, this is cool,

1706
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
but there wasn't just enough interest in it.

1707
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Which, by the way, that was also, I think,

1708
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,000
the same year that at one of the US electronic shows,

1709
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:36,000
they did the knitting machine that Howard Phillips actually showed being used.

1710
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
That was only just that prototype.

1711
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:44,000
But yeah, it was, it's an interesting idea.

1712
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
It's really neat.

1713
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I mean, the Singer Isaac machines,

1714
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
the thing about it is that,

1715
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,000
keep in mind that this release came out around the time that like,

1716
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
all those colorful IMAX were out, right?

1717
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
With all the various colors.

1718
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
These Isaac machines were no different.

1719
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,000
It had that same kind of aqua blue color.

1720
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:07,000
And, you know, that matched one of the Game Boy colors.

1721
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
But there were other rakaraku sewing machines.

1722
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
One of them, not sewing machines, the machine, but the game.

1723
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,000
There was an embroidery one,

1724
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:21,000
and then there was another one that was sort of like a stitch embellishment one.

1725
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,000
So yeah, there were a total of four, quote,

1726
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:29,000
game cartridges that were released to be used with the sewing machine.

1727
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,000
And I know it's not technically a peripheral,

1728
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:39,000
but it is a piece of gaming history and something that's meant to work with it.

1729
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:45,000
For example, the Jaguar release that came out in Japan

1730
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
actually had a little docking station for a Game Boy

1731
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,000
that you would plug it directly into the Game Boy while it had the game running on it.

1732
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
And then with the embroidery attachment.

1733
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
So, it's pretty neat.

1734
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I wouldn't, you know, I'd be lying if I said I didn't want one.

1735
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
I would like one.

1736
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,000
But, again, I don't have 1,400 bucks for it.

1737
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:13,000
So, there you go. That's your peripheral of the month.

1738
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
And, of course, you can imagine not a lot of people really know about this,

1739
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
or they're hearing about this for the first time.

1740
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
So, some comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1741
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I'll find a picture of it for everyone.

1742
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
SJ100Matt says, I did not know this existed.

1743
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Looking at it now, it's pretty impressive that the Game Boy Color could handle this.

1744
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Yeah, so that's kind of neat.

1745
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
I put a link to one of the articles I got my information from,

1746
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
so you can see the US one.

1747
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Yeah.

1748
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,000
It's pretty neat. The Jaguar one is all red.

1749
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:44,000
And then I actually found a place that's selling them.

1750
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,000
So, if anyone wants one that has 400 bucks for it,

1751
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,000
and is going to be selfish to not buy me one, I'll link it for you.

1752
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,000
All right. Well, there it is, your classic peripheral of the month.

1753
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
We are going to take a break, but when we come back,

1754
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come,

1755
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
including some more rapid-fire news.

1756
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
We're going to get into release dates as well,

1757
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
and your calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype,

1758
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:12,000
when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1759
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio,

1760
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:27,000
live with our 740th episode already in progress for tonight, August 5th, 2018,

1761
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
taping live as we always do at the Voice of Geeks Network,

1762
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
where we just got back from a little music break.

1763
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
And I can't help but read some of the chat happening during the music break.

1764
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
So, Bobby shared a link with you about Animal Crossing.

1765
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,000
I am putting this actually on my fan page.

1766
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Yeah? What is this?

1767
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
How grammar works in Animal Crossing, apparently.

1768
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
So, it does grade you on grammar?

1769
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Yeah, it has, like, certain – they're very simple rules,

1770
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:52,000
but, like, you have to, like, whenever you put in a punctuation mark,

1771
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
like a period or exclamation or, you know,

1772
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,000
you have to use a capital letter within three characters after.

1773
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,000
So, it counts for doing the double space after a period.

1774
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Oh, so it lets you do either way.

1775
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Yeah.

1776
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Why would it let you do the wrong way? I'm just kidding.

1777
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
So, I can write, you know, Bob – Bobra and say, like,

1778
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
you are the most smartest person in the village.

1779
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
The person did a period space, a period space,

1780
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
just nothing but a letter full of it.

1781
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
But if you do, like, I think more than 75 characters

1782
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,000
without any capital letters or punctuation,

1783
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
you get scored down 150 points.

1784
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Wow.

1785
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Yeah, so –

1786
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Interesting.

1787
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
It's really cool. I'm going to post it up on my fan page.

1788
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Okay. That's – who knew?

1789
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Still wish Nintendo would announce a new Animal Crossing game already,

1790
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
but I suppose nothing else yet.

1791
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
We'll see what they are announcing around the gaming world

1792
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
as we quickly look at some rapid fire news.

1793
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Loki.

1794
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
All right.

1795
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:53,000
So, we talked about last week what the Xbox Games with Gold lineup is,

1796
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:58,000
and now it's time for the PlayStation Plus free games for August.

1797
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
So, starting off from PlayStation 4,

1798
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
we have Mafia III and Dead by Daylight.

1799
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:08,000
On PlayStation 3, Bound by Flame and Serious Sam III BFE.

1800
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:14,000
And finally, on PlayStation Vita, Draw Slasher and Space Hulk.

1801
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
So, those are your free games.

1802
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Mafia III looks pretty cool. I'll have to check that out.

1803
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
But neat.

1804
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
And then a game I've been looking forward to

1805
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
and finally is going to be coming out.

1806
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Unfortunately, someone –

1807
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I know that we had a story a few weeks ago

1808
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:34,000
about how an iOS publisher had ripped it off

1809
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
and made a clone game out of it,

1810
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
but Donut Country is a game that's going to be coming out to PlayStation 4

1811
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,000
and PC and iOS on August 28th.

1812
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
For those not familiar with it,

1813
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,000
it is kind of like a katamari game.

1814
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
It's a little bit of a reverse katamari.

1815
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Basically, you control a hole that gets bigger as you drop things into it.

1816
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
And so, as you drop, you start with smaller things and then larger things,

1817
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
and you solve puzzles doing that and stuff.

1818
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:03,000
And it's got a funny little raccoon that's like the main character in the game.

1819
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Trash panda.

1820
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Definitely worth checking out.

1821
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I'm very excited to play this.

1822
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,000
I've been looking forward to it ever since I saw the first trailer for it.

1823
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
I'll play Trash Panda the game.

1824
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
I do wish Namco would make a new katamari damashi game already.

1825
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
This is not mobile.

1826
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Not the katamari tapping game and that crap.

1827
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
I want a legit new game.

1828
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
But one thing that Namco is doing

1829
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
is that they're putting out Donkey – excuse me,

1830
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
they're not putting that out, but they're putting out Taiku no Tatsujin

1831
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
out here in the west as well as Europe.

1832
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
But apparently it's going to be digital only,

1833
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
both places, even though there was box art floating around out there.

1834
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
It's going to be digital only, both places after all.

1835
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:42,000
They're not releasing the actual taiko drum,

1836
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
which, in my opinion,

1837
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
completely fucking defeats the purpose of Taiku no Tatsujin.

1838
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
But all right, I suppose there's some people that will play button button mode.

1839
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:54,000
But you can, on the Nintendo Switch, use Donkey Konga bongos.

1840
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
That's why I started to say donkey, because the story is about that.

1841
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
If you actually use the GameCube adapter with your Switch,

1842
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
you can plug in Donkey Konga bongos,

1843
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
and you can play Taiku no Tatsujin with that,

1844
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:09,000
if, you know, you have Donkey Konga bongos still sitting around somewhere.

1845
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Good luck with that.

1846
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I mean, I guess maybe you could still find them at a thrift store.

1847
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Yeah, eBay or a thrift store or something.

1848
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Locally, you know, was it like Dimple?

1849
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Man, if you want anything retro game, everything.

1850
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:27,000
But I do think it's a bonehead move to at least let a special order or something.

1851
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,000
At least do, like, an Amazon or, you know, a store.

1852
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Play Asia.

1853
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Well, not even, like, just like some type of, like, US release or something.

1854
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Like, it would be really nice if Namco would support that,

1855
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,000
because I kind of think they're just setting this game up to fail otherwise.

1856
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,000
So, which is a bummer for all the Taiku no Tatsujin fans out there.

1857
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,000
But I guess there's some people that'll tap the screen or use their buttons,

1858
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
but it's just, it's not the same thing.

1859
01:34:52,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Anyway, Beatmania 2DX still trucking along after all these years with the location test of 26th style,

1860
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,000
although they stopped calling them my numbers a long time ago.

1861
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:12,000
This particular version is called Beatmania 2DX Rootage is the name of it.

1862
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Rootage, if you want to be fancy. R-O-O-T-A-G-E, Rootage.

1863
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Well, Rootage, that just makes me think of watching all those Guy Tang videos.

1864
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Yeah.

1865
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,000
With him talking about, we're going to do a Chateau Root on her Rootage.

1866
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
So, the location test happened this past weekend.

1867
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Our pals at Bimani Style have a nice little write-up on it if you want to see some of the artwork from the game and so forth.

1868
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
It looks like they might be, like, making the How to Play stickers general,

1869
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
so they don't have to keep updating it with every release and stuff.

1870
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
They might be making some changes to how high speed works.

1871
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
There's apparently 10 different high speed settings now,

1872
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:49,000
and it all scrolls the same regardless of the song's BPM.

1873
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:54,000
So, that's kind of neat, although it does point out the BPM changes will still happen within a song.

1874
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:58,000
You can also do playlists through QR codes, kind of interesting.

1875
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:03,000
But, other things that I thought was very interesting is that I was looking at the song list,

1876
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,000
and, you know, it's a lot of stuff I don't follow as much as I used to,

1877
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
although some of the artists are still there after all these years.

1878
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Kors K, still there. A new song called Wonderland, and so forth.

1879
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:22,000
But I thought this was interesting is that Porter Robinson has a song in Beat Media 2DX Rootage, or 26.

1880
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:27,000
It's under his alias that he puts music out under now called Virtual Self,

1881
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
and the song is called Particle Arts.

1882
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,000
So, if you've listened to that EP on Spotify or what have you,

1883
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
that song is actually going to be in Beat Media 2DX,

1884
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:40,000
and he actually tweeted about that on his account, Virtual Self, the song in the game, so that's there.

1885
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I think that's kind of notable because Porter Robinson was kind of known for, or is kind of known for,

1886
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:51,000
he has directly cited Bamani music as some of his influence as being a DJ.

1887
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:56,000
He's the one that will drop Look to the Sky and shit in the middle of his DJing and stuff when he does those things.

1888
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:00,000
I think he just did a big gig at Vegas, I think it was a big electronic festival in Vegas a couple weeks ago,

1889
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:06,000
because I think our pal DNL was there, so I think she was posting stuff from his set and stuff.

1890
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,000
So anyway, it's kind of interesting how that's come full circle,

1891
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:16,000
is that stuff like Beat Media and Bamani influenced this guy, he's a young guy, he's only in his early 20s,

1892
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:23,000
influenced him and now he is influencing future Beat Media games by having one of his songs in it.

1893
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:28,000
So, if you want to hear the song, it's on Spotify, Apple Music, all those places.

1894
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Again, Porter Robinson now kind of goes by Virtual Self, he's one of those musical artists that changes his name,

1895
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:39,000
and the song is called Particle Arts, if you want a little preview of what that will sound like on the soundtrack.

1896
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,000
So, that's it for me, DarkSakura, what do you have for Rapid Fire News?

1897
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Some stuff. Basically, the Nintendo Switch for the June 2018 report,

1898
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:59,000
actually is the only system that had software sales that increased over that particular quarter,

1899
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:05,000
but that's not all, the NES Classic was the number one best-selling hardware.

1900
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:11,000
So, they beat out the PS4. Suck it, Sony!

1901
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:23,000
So, the NES Classic sold more than the PS4. Funny how those things can sell when you actually put them on shelves.

1902
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Funny how that works, right, Logie?

1903
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Yeah, it is funny how that works. It makes sense, though, because it was unavailable for the longest time,

1904
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:36,000
and then now, I don't think there was any really big games coming out in June.

1905
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:42,000
No, it's been a slow month for console, but still, you have to appreciate the novelty of,

1906
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:50,000
here we are in the year 2018, and the best-selling gaming system of last month was the Nintendo Entertainment System.

1907
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,000
People were worried they weren't going to be able to get it. They thought it was going to be limited.

1908
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Guilty!

1909
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Anyway, in other news, Mario Kart 4 Wii is showing up on Nvidia Shield in China,

1910
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:08,000
which is basically how they get pretty much any Nintendo game, is it has to show up on Nvidia Shield.

1911
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:13,000
That's how they got all the N64 titles that came out of there.

1912
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Yeah, Nvidia has some agreement with Nintendo, but it's like for China.

1913
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Yeah, because I saw someone, maybe a Eurogamer, looking at the emulator with it and stuff,

1914
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:29,000
and saying that it's upresing some of the textures, or upresing the geometry, but not the texture.

1915
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:34,000
I don't know, something like that. But it's like its own unique emulator that's running the stuff,

1916
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,000
because they have, Mario Galaxy was one of the games that was on there.

1917
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Yeah, that's it.

1918
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I think they might be editing some of the games, too, because I thought I heard that...

1919
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Well, they have to.

1920
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Well, not like... Well, yeah. Is China the country where you can't show skeletons,

1921
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:55,000
where they had to change the undead in World of Warcraft because you can't show skeletons?

1922
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
I don't know.

1923
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Was it zombies?

1924
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Well, because I'm thinking of Dry Bones, the turtle. Wasn't he a playable...

1925
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
But there's other things that they have to edit out, too.

1926
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Well, and not just that, but I was thinking more like the multiplayer, I believe they had called out,

1927
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:13,000
which is not going to be in the Mario Kart Wii. They removed it, basically.

1928
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Sorry, online multiplayer specifically. Obviously, in the same room is what Mario Kart's known for.

1929
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,000
That's still there. But the online multiplayer has been removed.

1930
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
So, interesting.

1931
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I mean, it makes sense, but...

1932
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:34,000
I think the thought that it's running on a Tegra-based console is that,

1933
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Hey, Nintendo has a Tegra-based console. Could we possibly get some of this shit on the Switch, please?

1934
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Hmm. Hey.

1935
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
The plot thickens.

1936
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
But, no. Probably not.

1937
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:53,000
All right. Well, let's talk about some things that are coming out a little sooner than Virtual Console,

1938
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:57,000
or whatever Nintendo's doing next. It's release dates. What's coming out this week?

1939
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Yeah, I was going to talk about releasing the game that I was working on,

1940
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,000
and talk about lowering the bars for expectations and stuff.

1941
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Even lower than what we would expect for the Virtual Console stuff.

1942
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,000
But anyways, this week we've got a few things.

1943
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:19,000
So, starting off on PC, Mac and Linux, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1944
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:23,000
We have Dead Cells, which is a roguelike Metroidvania game.

1945
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Flipping Death on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1946
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Overcooked 2 on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1947
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Layton's Mystery Journey DX on a Nintendo Switch.

1948
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I didn't even realize there was a Professor Layton game coming to the Switch.

1949
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Minute, which is pretty awesome looking, and that's also coming to the Switch.

1950
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Monster Hunter World on PC, Okami HD on the Nintendo Switch, Yakuza 3,

1951
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I'm assuming the remaster on PlayStation 4.

1952
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:06,000
And then we've got Football, Madden NFL 19 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1953
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
No one buys that stuff.

1954
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:14,000
And finally, I guess coming out of Early Access, We Happy Few on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1955
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,000
It feels early for Madden to be released, but I guess August is the month.

1956
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
It is August. I guess so.

1957
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,000
They used to tend towards the end of the month, but...

1958
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Maybe they want to get the kids before they're back in school.

1959
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Or, well, shit, kids are going back to school next week.

1960
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:30,000
It feels like they go back earlier and earlier.

1961
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
So, wow.

1962
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Well, anyhow, let's go to Japan and talk about what's coming out there.

1963
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,000
On the PlayStation 4 in Japan this week, Bullet Girls Fantasia.

1964
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,000
If you want to check that out from D3, that's out this week on PS4.

1965
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Darkest Dungeon, as well as Fire Pro Wrestling World.

1966
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Jake Hunter Detective Story, Prism of Eyes.

1967
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,000
That Bullet Girls Fantasia also has a limited edition version.

1968
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:55,000
There's a remaster of Ryu Ga Gotoku 3.

1969
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
And there is...

1970
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Oh, that's it.

1971
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Because the rest I'm looking at is for the next week after that.

1972
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
So that's what you have on the Vita this week.

1973
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Looking at the Nintendo Switch, some of those same games are also out on the Switch, including Darkest Dungeon.

1974
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Jake Hunter Detective Story, Prism of Eyes.

1975
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:14,000
The Layton's Mysterious Journey, that is also out in Japan this week.

1976
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
That same one that Loki referenced.

1977
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Also out in Japan this week on the Switch.

1978
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Okami.

1979
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:23,000
So the Switch port of Okami is out this week, so that's pretty cool.

1980
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
And then Waku Waku Sweets.

1981
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:31,000
My Okashi Ga Dekiru Kana comes out this week on the Switch.

1982
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
And I'm trying to see if this is something I would recognize.

1983
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Because it's from a company called Sonic Power.

1984
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
But no, sadly it has something to do with Sonic the Hedgehog.

1985
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
It's happy sweets making.

1986
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,000
It's basically, let's learn how to make a cake.

1987
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Is basically what it is.

1988
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Go bake me a cake.

1989
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Yeah, go bake me a cake.

1990
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:54,000
But it has this cute, look at this cute little doggy that wears a necklace made out of strawberries with this big pink bow.

1991
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:59,000
And I just want to take that cute little puppy and say, go make me a cake, bitch.

1992
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
I can say that because it's a dog.

1993
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Only because it's a female dog.

1994
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
This reminds me of Cooking Mama.

1995
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:10,000
And Cooking Mama, let's be fair, I know Waluigi is really a big contender for Smash.

1996
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:13,000
But Cooking Mama should really be a character in Smash.

1997
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Loki, you still don't want to hear about this, but I saw the most amazing tweet this week.

1998
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:23,000
It was a guy dressed up as Waluigi, but it was completely in leather gear.

1999
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:32,000
So he was wearing a Waluigi leather hat and little leather and showing off the chest and all that stuff.

2000
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Guys that are in the leather do.

2001
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
And I was just like, that's art.

2002
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Alternative costume.

2003
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
I think it was actually a bearded drag performer who did it.

2004
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
I think it was, I'll find it in our soccer so you can see it.

2005
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:50,000
This is something I can see one of your buddies here locally doing.

2006
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:54,000
So anyway, but first UK releases while I try to find that.

2007
01:44:54,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Overcooked 2 comes out on August 7th for PlayStation 4, Xbone, and Switch.

2008
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:07,000
On the PC we have Quake Champion Scale Bearer Edition on August 9th.

2009
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:13,000
And then on the 10th we have Madden 19, who gives a shit.

2010
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:18,000
And We Happy Few for several different systems.

2011
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
And that is it.

2012
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
I have to see the leather daddy.

2013
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Helvetica is the name of the queen that did that.

2014
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Girl.

2015
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,000
But a bearded drag performer, so.

2016
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Some of that's photoshopped.

2017
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,000
You think?

2018
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,000
I think it is.

2019
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
I don't know.

2020
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
The eyeshadow looks legit.

2021
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
The nose.

2022
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
I think the nose is legit.

2023
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,000
I think that's photoshopped.

2024
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,000
It is?

2025
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Alright, maybe.

2026
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Unless he's got some really good pigment.

2027
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I still laughed.

2028
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,000
That cracked me up.

2029
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Alright.

2030
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Anyway.

2031
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Honestly it's the little mustache coming right out of his nostril that looks like it's painted

2032
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,000
on in Photoshop.

2033
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Akuma Wants A Link.

2034
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I figured some of you would want this.

2035
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
It's Helvetica Queen.

2036
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
But it's not spelled the way you would think.

2037
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,000
It's not spelled like the font.

2038
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:03,000
H-E-L-L-V-E-T-I-K-A.

2039
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Queen.

2040
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,000
And then it would be on their Twitter feed if you want to see that.

2041
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Alright.

2042
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Anyhow, I can't believe I just gave out that tweet on there.

2043
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Alright.

2044
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
I thought it was.

2045
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
I was like, that's a good idea.

2046
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
That was well done.

2047
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Alright, anyway.

2048
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Let's get to the mailbag.

2049
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Every week you guys send us emails.

2050
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2051
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Although I don't remember if we got any this week.

2052
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
But I suppose our soccer's gonna tell me in a minute here.

2053
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is where you send emails and we read them here on error,

2054
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
which we're gonna do right now.

2055
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,000
One.

2056
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Uno.

2057
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Rob, I was watching your stream this week of No Man's Sky.

2058
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,000
I know you'll probably mention it in your gaming week.

2059
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:48,000
I was curious to know what you think of the update.

2060
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Is it something you will continue to play?

2061
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Also, I was wondering about the multiplayer.

2062
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
I know you can have up to four people in your game,

2063
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:00,000
but I can't understand what the point is in naming a creature that you discover

2064
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,000
or making your base discoverable for other players when it seems to be invite only.

2065
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,000
I'm gonna jump in.

2066
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Awkward, but I think we actually did do this one last week.

2067
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Oh, okay.

2068
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I seem to remember responding to it, but it was after you.

2069
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Then delete the mail.

2070
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,000
I checked the date.

2071
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
He's getting rusty in his old age.

2072
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,000
I do.

2073
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Here's the thing.

2074
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,000
I'm spoiled.

2075
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Cursing on Bobby's show.

2076
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Remember when we had major problems with the emails

2077
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
and we weren't able to log into the mailbag?

2078
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,000
I had them all forwarded to my personal account,

2079
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
and I just never turned that off,

2080
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
so I just read them from my personal account.

2081
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Sorry, Jamie.

2082
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Well, now the box is empty.

2083
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:44,000
I've even moved that Street Fighter IV code into another folder.

2084
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Fair enough.

2085
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:49,000
DarkSakura's cleaning up the mess in the inbox.

2086
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,000
I'm always cleaning up after.

2087
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,000
What is it that we threaten to do if the box is empty?

2088
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,000
I forget what we were gonna be talking about.

2089
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Something that was really...

2090
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,000
We were gonna email each other?

2091
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Oh, yeah, there was something we were gonna talk about

2092
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
that was gonna be really offensive.

2093
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,000
I don't remember what it was.

2094
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
It wasn't offensive to your senses, basically.

2095
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
What is the most offensive thing?

2096
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
I'll just let DarkSakura talk about it.

2097
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,000
You know what?

2098
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Dick cheese.

2099
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Okay, no, no, no, no.

2100
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Here it is.

2101
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Dick cheese is pretty offensive, though.

2102
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Official punishment to the listeners.

2103
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
As punishment for not emailing us in the past week,

2104
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
I am going to ask DarkSakura more information

2105
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,000
about her trip to the Bolt.

2106
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:22,000
So tell me more about your trip to the Leather Daddy Bar.

2107
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Actually, my trip to the Bolt was really otherwise uneventful.

2108
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,000
No, but I ordered a Lynchburg lemonade.

2109
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Okay.

2110
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,000
And they didn't have lemonade,

2111
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,000
so they made it out of sour mix and triple sec.

2112
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,000
So I was toasty by that point,

2113
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,000
so I decided to get in the leather harness swing

2114
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,000
and sit in it like it was a toddler swing

2115
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:46,000
and swing back and forth on stage at the Bolt.

2116
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,000
And then I got a picture of one of the other sisters

2117
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,000
with her legs spread way out up on the chain,

2118
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
because you know what the harness looks like.

2119
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Have you been to the Bolt?

2120
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Yeah, I've seen it.

2121
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
I haven't been in it, but I've seen it.

2122
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
It's a four-chain leather harness

2123
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
that's got a big leather seat in the middle.

2124
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
And so I was sitting on there swinging

2125
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
like I was in grade school,

2126
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,000
and then I got down and then we went in the back seat

2127
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
and I saw chickens fucking.

2128
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
At least it looked like it.

2129
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
The chickens, okay, I think they were all,

2130
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
there were chickens in the backyard.

2131
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
It's been a while since I've been in the bars,

2132
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
but I don't remember any of this stuff.

2133
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,000
This is the Bolt.

2134
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
This is the CE bar close to the suburbs.

2135
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
It's the leather bar, but it has a backyard.

2136
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
And I don't think chickens actually-

2137
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,000
It's actually fine.

2138
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
It's not as scandalous as she makes it sound.

2139
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
But they were these different hens

2140
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
that seemed like they were all just humping each other

2141
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
for some reason.

2142
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
And I'm like, what the fuck are you chickens doing?

2143
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
And then apparently there's rabbits back there too,

2144
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,000
but I know about that.

2145
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:46,000
And then I went back in and watched more gay porn.

2146
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
All right, there you go, listeners.

2147
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Your punishment for not sending us any emails this week.

2148
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
For the record.

2149
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
And if you continue to not email us,

2150
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
we will have more stories from Dark Soccer's weekends.

2151
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
For the record, bottoms Y.

2152
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Now I know why-

2153
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Enough, enough punishment, enough.

2154
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Save it for next week, just in case.

2155
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
All right, let's get to some more video.

2156
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
If you haven't already turned off the show,

2157
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,000
let's get to some more video game news, Loki.

2158
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
My freaking ears!

2159
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Uh, so let's talk a little.

2160
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:22,000
This is almost as offensive as what we were just listening to.

2161
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Um, microtransactions in Gran Turismo Sport.

2162
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
They promised.

2163
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,000
They said, hey, we're not gonna put microtransactions in this game.

2164
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:34,000
And then sure enough, with the July update for Gran Turismo Sport,

2165
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:38,000
it added new tracks, more cars, oh, and microtransactions.

2166
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
They said that they weren't gonna do it.

2167
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Um, so basically,

2168
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
um, you can purchase cars outright,

2169
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
as long as, I guess,

2170
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:50,000
they're less than two million in in-game currency.

2171
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Um, apparently,

2172
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
what's gonna change is that,

2173
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,000
um, for now, I guess you're gonna be able to buy cars,

2174
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
I guess, for real money, too.

2175
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
So they're listing them for, like, three bucks

2176
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,000
in, uh, the PlayStation Store.

2177
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
If you don't wanna grind for,

2178
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
you know, I guess the Alpine Vision.

2179
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Gran Turismo 2017.

2180
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Um...

2181
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
I don't know.

2182
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
I'm not surprised anymore, you know what?

2183
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,000
It's just the way this stuff is going.

2184
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Gotta make all of the money.

2185
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
If you're willing to pay it,

2186
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
they're willing to sell it.

2187
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
But it's kinda lame, like,

2188
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,000
maybe even a little bit disingenuous that they

2189
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
promise that they're not gonna do it.

2190
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
They sell you the copy of the game,

2191
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
patch it in later, and it's like...

2192
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Welp.

2193
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Yeah, that's a little...

2194
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Too fucking bad for you. You already paid it.

2195
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
You know, paid the money.

2196
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
It's like, you know...

2197
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,000
But there's excuses gonna be,

2198
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
oh, we're giving player choice,

2199
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,000
or something like this.

2200
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
You don't have to grind in-game.

2201
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,000
You can...

2202
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Our game isn't worth grinding in.

2203
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Spend the money to not play the game.

2204
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,000
That never made any sense to me.

2205
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Especially way after the fact.

2206
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
It makes you, like, not even wanna connect your game online

2207
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
to get these types of patches, you know what I mean?

2208
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
It's just like, you know, the other games, too.

2209
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Shadow of War, where they, like, had the microtransactions in there,

2210
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
and the room, the balancing of the game.

2211
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,000
And then, like, months later, after nobody's using that shit anymore,

2212
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,000
then they're like,

2213
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:20,000
oh, we're doing the good thing and taking it out.

2214
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Look how awesome we are.

2215
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,000
See, we listen.

2216
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
We listen to you, consumer.

2217
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Alright, real quick, before we move on,

2218
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Bobby's being that guy in chat,

2219
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
saying, Devil's Advocate, the price of the cars doesn't change.

2220
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:35,000
So, I guess you can still get them the old way, if you want.

2221
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Right, but it's the fact that they're offering that in the first place,

2222
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,000
as an incentive.

2223
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
They're making the grind.

2224
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
I'm assuming the grind is diff-

2225
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,000
It is a grind.

2226
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
If it was easy, then it wouldn't be an incentive.

2227
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,000
It's basically an unlock code.

2228
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
DJ Max did the same thing not that long ago.

2229
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
They put out a thing that you can download to, like,

2230
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
just basically unlock all of the songs.

2231
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Anyway.

2232
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Just wanna say, um, it was announced in chat.

2233
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Thank you, SSJ100Matt.

2234
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:05,000
SonicFox just won the Dragon Ball FighterZ championship.

2235
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
First suit and all.

2236
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
We have a victor who is a furry.

2237
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Okay, fun. Work.

2238
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,000
I watched him play.

2239
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
I think he was the Ten Shinhan player.

2240
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I saw an interview with him somewhere, so.

2241
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Pretty, pretty crazy.

2242
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Props to them, but my god, that's gotta be fucking hot.

2243
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,000
That's gotta be so hot.

2244
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,000
I know, that's the only thing.

2245
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Like, I don't even think about the things that people say about, like,

2246
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,000
furries and that and all this.

2247
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Like, I don't even care.

2248
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Like, I'm just like, that guy's gotta be fucking sweating in there.

2249
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Maybe he's got fans and all that stuff. I don't know.

2250
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
No, not this. This first suit doesn't.

2251
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:36,000
I mean, it looks like his first suit is really just, like,

2252
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,000
the arm pieces and the thing.

2253
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:43,000
But he was, when I watched him play last night, he was, um,

2254
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:46,000
just wearing a furry hat.

2255
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Not the full suit.

2256
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Okay, I mean, that's just.

2257
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I can imagine, like, if they have some sort of stage lighting,

2258
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
so that shit's gotta be fucking cooking.

2259
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,000
SSJ100Matt says he only wore the head after the match has ended.

2260
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Okay, that's a little better.

2261
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Okay, we'll do that.

2262
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,000
But still.

2263
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Yeah.

2264
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Still, I'm like, oh my god, I'd pass out.

2265
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Alright, anyway.

2266
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Uh, thank you for the update.

2267
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Uh, another update for you guys.

2268
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,000
I don't know if anyone's using Gamefly, the streaming.

2269
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Weren't they? Didn't they used to be a mail order service?

2270
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Yeah.

2271
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Well, they switched to streaming some time ago,

2272
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
so they're, like, a streaming only service, and.

2273
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
I didn't know they had streaming.

2274
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Yeah, they kind of shifted to that, and now they're gonna be gone gone.

2275
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Uh, because Gamefly, uh, got acquired by EA, so.

2276
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Well, well, throw in the towel.

2277
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
They're gonna consume yet another country.

2278
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Hey, this time they're even going outside of game developers.

2279
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Hey, fuck it. We're gonna eat in this company now.

2280
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,000
It's, uh, it's, uh.

2281
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Gotta feed the devil.

2282
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,000
The Grim Reaper's just pointing, just sign here.

2283
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Anyway, Bobby says they are still mail order.

2284
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
They never shifted away, so I guess they, that is still.

2285
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,000
I thought they, I thought they, I heard they had closed it down.

2286
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Because I, I, maybe I just ended my account at some point.

2287
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
But I thought I'd heard they closed down. Anyway.

2288
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Uh, so Gamefly's gonna shut down the streaming service, uh,

2289
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,000
because, uh, EA, uh, got them.

2290
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Uh, Gamefly streaming launched in 2015 as part of Amazon Fire TV,

2291
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,000
and now it's built into a lot of Samsung TVs and so forth.

2292
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:14,000
You can still get games on the mail discs, so that is still a thing that happens.

2293
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Uh, but Gamefly streaming's closure, uh, is happening

2294
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:22,000
when it seems like game streaming is, like, still a thing that's growing out there.

2295
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:26,000
I mean, if you look at PlayStation Now, or you're looking at, uh,

2296
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
you know, what Microsoft's been doing.

2297
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Uh, EA, of course, also has its own thing, the Origin Access Premier.

2298
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,000
So I don't know if maybe some of what, of course,

2299
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:40,000
well, maybe some of the things that Gamefly had, they're gonna fold into it

2300
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:44,000
to make that more attractive or whatever. I don't know.

2301
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:50,000
How can we micro, or how can we add microtransactions to game streaming?

2302
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Because I'm sure that's what they would want to know.

2303
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Fucking hate EA. Seriously.

2304
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Alright. Well, anyhow, I learned today that Gamefly is still around.

2305
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:04,000
I seriously thought they had gone under years ago.

2306
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Maybe I'm mixing them up with, um, I must be mixing them up with somebody else.

2307
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Is there another? Well, I knew about that one.

2308
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:15,000
But, yeah, I used to get dissed from them too, and then it just kind of stopped.

2309
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:18,000
I don't know. Anyway, maybe I did cancel it when I wasn't paying attention.

2310
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Uh, Bobby says, uh, I'm mixing them up with OnLive, maybe.

2311
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Maybe that's it. Maybe I'm mixing them up with OnLive,

2312
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
even though I know OnLive was a streaming thing.

2313
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
But anyway, let's move on. It doesn't matter anymore.

2314
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Dark Sakura, you got another story for us.

2315
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Yes, I do have another story.

2316
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Um, in this story, it has to do with King of Fighters.

2317
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,000
And Pokemon Go-ish stuff.

2318
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:43,000
It's basically an augmented reality the King of Fighters Go.

2319
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Um, you wander around picking up different fighters and fighting them,

2320
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,000
and then they join your repertoire.

2321
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Yeah, you just keep building teams to fight other, other players.

2322
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:02,000
So, um, it looks interesting. I guess it should be fun.

2323
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,000
I don't see, I don't know if it's going to come out in the US, though.

2324
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Maybe it's still in testing?

2325
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:10,000
But yeah, it's supposed to be doing, it was originally titled, um,

2326
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:13,000
King of Fighters the Orochi Saga Go,

2327
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:19,000
which means it was based around the 95, 97 Orochi Saga from the game.

2328
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:24,000
So, the beta was from July 27th through July 31st

2329
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,000
for iPhone, uh, using TestFlight.

2330
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
And the Android beta is unannounced.

2331
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:34,000
But maybe, maybe we'll see it. Who knows?

2332
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Now, this is a Go game I would check out.

2333
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
It can't be worse than Garfield Go.

2334
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Like, you want to, and that Jurassic Park game.

2335
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,000
My sister is, she plays that game, the Jurassic Park one,

2336
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
and she's like, you gotta play this game.

2337
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,000
I'm like, no.

2338
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
It's, it's okay. It's better than the Garfield one,

2339
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
but it's just, it's not Pokemon.

2340
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Garfield's just crap.

2341
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Yeah, the Garfield one is garbage.

2342
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,000
But I play, I check out King of Fighters.

2343
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
It was Garfield bitch.

2344
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Anyway, um, so I, I hate to keep going back to this,

2345
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:02,000
but Evo is going on, I suppose.

2346
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
And this, this just came across my Twitter feed.

2347
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:10,000
So, uh, SonicFox, who just won, uh, tweeted this, uh, five minutes ago.

2348
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:15,000
I'm gay. Also the best DBFZ player on this fucking planet.

2349
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Don't forget it.

2350
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Awesome.

2351
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
To which I respond, work bitch.

2352
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,000
So yeah, the, and I looked at the bio for, uh, this individual.

2353
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:29,000
I'm a black queer furry who will mixture shit in fighting games.

2354
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Own it, live it, love it, work.

2355
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
That's all I have to say about that.

2356
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,000
I am now a fan.

2357
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:39,000
I need to find that tweet just so I can go, yes, bitch.

2358
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Uh, it's, um, his Twitter is SonicFox5000.

2359
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Okay.

2360
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,000
There you go.

2361
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,000
All right.

2362
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Let's, uh, let's continue on.

2363
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Uh, Loki, just another story for us.

2364
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,000
And then, uh, just a couple more.

2365
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
We're gonna get to the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,

2366
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,000
all one word on Skype.

2367
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
So I'm probably gonna have a controversial opinion about this,

2368
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:00,000
but let's just talk about the story first and then we'll get to that.

2369
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:06,000
So there is this little girl by the name of, um, Penny McDonald,

2370
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:10,000
and she has released her debut game, Answer the Question, on Steam.

2371
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Um, what's notable is Penny is only seven years old,

2372
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
and apparently since she was a toddler,

2373
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:18,000
she has been interested in making games.

2374
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
I guess her dad is a game developer,

2375
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,000
and she even started with learning, um, you know,

2376
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Windows 98 learning in QBasic and that kind of stuff.

2377
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
And so now she's released her.

2378
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:33,000
She released her text game, um, onto Steam,

2379
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,000
and it's cute that it's on there.

2380
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:40,000
And so it's basically this terminal-looking game

2381
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:45,000
where you answer math questions, and that's it for 99 cents.

2382
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,000
So here's where I get controversial about it.

2383
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,000
I think it's great that she's releasing a game.

2384
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Why is it on Steam?

2385
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Yes.

2386
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Why the fuck is it on Steam?

2387
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Like, I get it.

2388
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:58,000
I'm all for her releasing a game.

2389
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:02,000
That's where itch.io is a great place to do that, okay?

2390
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,000
This shit does not need to be on Steam.

2391
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
I mean, I guess I shouldn't judge

2392
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,000
because there's a lot of garbage on Steam,

2393
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:15,000
but if this was anybody else making a game,

2394
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:18,000
it would just be like, why the fuck is this on Steam?

2395
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
And it's just because she's a little girl, and that's fine.

2396
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
You know, encourage her to make games,

2397
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,000
but it does not belong on Steam.

2398
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:29,000
It doesn't. It just doesn't.

2399
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:34,000
I don't want to, like, crap on a seven-year-old's game.

2400
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,000
And I haven't played the game, so I can't speak to the quality.

2401
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
But, you know, to be fair, it's fine.

2402
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:42,000
It's gonna get buried under the garbage that is Steam anyway.

2403
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,000
So whatever. I guess it's not really hurting anything,

2404
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:48,000
but it's not helping anything either.

2405
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
It's great. Good for her.

2406
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
I hope she keeps channeling that energy

2407
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
into continuing to make good games

2408
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:58,000
and so forth, but yeah, it is a little weird that, you know,

2409
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,000
you're right, it's gonna get buried under all the other garbage on Steam.

2410
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Yeah, it's her first game, and that's fine, but...

2411
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,000
I'm not gonna release... Okay.

2412
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:10,000
I showed Rob what my first game is.

2413
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
It's not even my first game.

2414
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
He did show me during the break.

2415
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
It does exist. I've seen it.

2416
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,000
But I'm not releasing that shit on Steam.

2417
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:23,000
No. I'm not doing that, because it's garbage.

2418
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
It's just to learn. I mean...

2419
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
You should call a seven-year-old's game garbage.

2420
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
I'm not saying it's garbage. I'm saying, like, it's QBasic.

2421
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,000
And QBasic, that's what you expect out of QBasic, is that shit.

2422
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
It's limited.

2423
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
It's very limited, and...

2424
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,000
I'm...

2425
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Great, but polish that up and then release it.

2426
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,000
It's like, just because you make your first game,

2427
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
does that mean it's ready to be published?

2428
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Make more games. Make a dozen more games.

2429
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:55,000
And then when you get, like, a really polished game, then release it.

2430
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:00,000
But I don't say, I guess there's no harm that it's on there,

2431
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:03,000
because it's not really taking up marketplace space, but it's...

2432
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:08,000
It's just showing that Steam has no quality control.

2433
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Because, not even, at least this is a functional game.

2434
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
And it works.

2435
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:16,000
We're gonna assume she did not implement a Bitcoin miner in the game.

2436
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Right. That'd be the twist.

2437
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Why are my resources so high?

2438
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
There's, like, text on the screen, and that's it.

2439
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
All you gullible people that fell for the...

2440
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,000
No, I shouldn't even say that. I'm sorry. I shouldn't say that.

2441
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:31,000
And then that's cool.

2442
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,000
And I used to make games like you and basic as well,

2443
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:39,000
but I'm not gonna go grab that shit and say it's ready for publishing.

2444
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:40,000
I don't know.

2445
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,000
I just, that's where I have kind of a little bit of an issue with it,

2446
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:46,000
but, you know, I'm glad that she's trying...

2447
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
She's trying... You know, it's actually...

2448
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Wait, the color is kind of a tangent a little bit.

2449
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
I don't know if you remember,

2450
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:56,000
there was a Kickstarter campaign

2451
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,000
that was this person's first game,

2452
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:02,000
and they were, I think, seven or eight years old as well,

2453
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
and it was, like, an RPG.

2454
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
She wanted to make an RPG an RPG maker,

2455
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:09,000
and it was, like, a troll quest thing or something like that.

2456
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
She was gonna fight against the internet trolls

2457
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,000
because people were saying that this Kickstarter campaign was bullshit

2458
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,000
because she wanted, like, thousands of dollars to build

2459
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
what essentially is an RPG maker game.

2460
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:24,000
It's like that only got attention because of the age.

2461
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
This is only getting attention because it's age as well.

2462
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:30,000
But I think where I agree,

2463
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:34,000
she should make games, she should put them out there, not on Steam.

2464
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,000
That's where I'm at.

2465
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:36,000
All right.

2466
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
So, you know, people want to fight you in chat, so here we go.

2467
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Bobby is starting off going,

2468
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,000
so where does it belong?

2469
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Somebody did respond.

2470
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,000
You'd mentioned itch.io.

2471
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Bobby said,

2472
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
I released my first game in middle school,

2473
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
and four people bought it.

2474
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:51,000
That's four more people than would have never bought it

2475
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:52,000
if I'd not published it.

2476
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
But you could put it on itch.io,

2477
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
you can sell it on itch.io,

2478
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
and I see no problem with that.

2479
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:03,000
The great thing about PC games is you can self-publish all you want.

2480
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Yeah, you can do that.

2481
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
It just doesn't need to be...

2482
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Priz, back when Bobby was in middle school,

2483
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:11,000
I'm assuming those were the days of shareware and BBSes and all that stuff,

2484
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,000
which is how we kinda sold our games.

2485
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,000
You know what? And that's fine.

2486
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:17,000
I guess, you know, at this point in the condition Steam is in,

2487
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
what's it gonna hurt?

2488
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
I mean, I just think in the bigger picture,

2489
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Steam should have some quality control stuff.

2490
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:27,000
I don't totally disagree with you, Loki.

2491
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:32,000
I get that you're pointing out that this is a Q basic game,

2492
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,000
and you don't want to...

2493
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,000
It's not even a Q basic game.

2494
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:37,000
I think it's something, but it resembles a basic game.

2495
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
You don't want to crap on the efforts of a little girl.

2496
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
You want to see her succeed,

2497
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:44,000
but Steam is maybe not, because this kind of exacerbates

2498
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,000
what the issue is with Steam,

2499
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:50,000
is that Steam will let literally anything in its door

2500
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
when that is not what Steam used to be.

2501
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Steam was a heavy, curated place that had these, you know,

2502
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:00,000
indie games and big AAA games alike and so forth,

2503
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:04,000
and then it just is kind of turned into the Google Play App Store at some point,

2504
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
where it's just everything and anything.

2505
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Right, and that's kind of where I'm at with it.

2506
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,000
It's just like...

2507
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
I don't know. I don't know really how to react to this.

2508
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:18,000
I mean, I guess it's cool that she's got a game that she's publishing.

2509
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Cool.

2510
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:20,000
I mean...

2511
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,000
I don't know.

2512
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
I went through a C++ course.

2513
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,000
The first one I did was...

2514
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:29,000
It was terminal.

2515
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
It was making terminal games,

2516
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:36,000
and one of those was like a roulette or slot machine game

2517
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,000
or something like that.

2518
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:40,000
That would be like if I published that on Steam.

2519
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Like, it's shit, okay?

2520
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Like, the fact that a seven-year-old made it,

2521
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:48,000
it makes it less shit because it's like,

2522
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
wow, this is pretty amazing for a seven-year-old.

2523
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Like, if my son made that, that's great.

2524
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
I would be like, wow, that's pretty awesome that you made a game.

2525
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:57,000
I would not go to publish it on Steam, though.

2526
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,000
I would say no.

2527
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
I'm like, hey, if you want to...

2528
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
We can try to sell a couple copies.

2529
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:06,000
I'll put it up on itch.io and I'll tweet out some stuff to my friends

2530
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,000
and we'll see if someone wants to buy it for $0.99,

2531
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
because that's all it is, is $0.99.

2532
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
But I'm not going to put it on Steam.

2533
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Even if it was my own kid making a game that looked exactly like that,

2534
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,000
I would not put that on Steam,

2535
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
because I know that's not where it belongs.

2536
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,000
I don't know.

2537
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Like, if somebody bakes a cake in an Easy-Bake oven,

2538
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:30,000
you don't go put it on the fucking grocery store shelf

2539
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
to sell it next to the cakes that they make.

2540
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Actually, you put it on YouTube to make it a specialty channel.

2541
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Bobby Blackwolf says, I'm going to go back to this point.

2542
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Why is it okay for itch.io to have garbage and not Steam?

2543
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:43,000
Shouldn't we be arguing for quality control for all?

2544
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:44,000
I actually...

2545
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
No, I think there is a difference between the two.

2546
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:50,000
I think itch.io is, by nature, an experimental playground,

2547
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
and there is less curation that goes on there,

2548
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:55,000
and that is both part of what makes it great

2549
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
is because you are going to find things there

2550
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
that you are not going to find anything else

2551
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
because of, by nature, what it is,

2552
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
and it's also going to make it, yeah,

2553
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
you're going to play a lot of garbage that's on itch.io,

2554
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:09,000
but when you go to itch.io, you know that's what it is.

2555
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:12,000
And they also have kind of like blog stuff too,

2556
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:16,000
like it's a big old like, hey, I'm seven and this is my first game,

2557
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
and you can talk a little bit about it and stuff.

2558
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
I mean, I guess you could do that on Steam as well,

2559
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
but Steam is like a commercial marketplace.

2560
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,000
itch.io, I don't really...

2561
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
I mean, I know they sell games on itch.io,

2562
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:28,000
but I'm not like, I'm getting the new release games on itch.io.

2563
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:32,000
It's the indie record store versus, I guess, Walmart,

2564
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
because there are no big record stores anymore.

2565
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Like, the same could be said with like GOG or something like that.

2566
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:40,000
I wouldn't want it on GOG either. I wouldn't want it on Humble Store.

2567
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:44,000
It's not viable for a commercial marketplace.

2568
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
It's a neat indie thing.

2569
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
It's cool that you made your project

2570
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:51,000
and that you want to sell it and see if you can sell something,

2571
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
but like, I don't understand.

2572
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Okay, for me, MXC, and we'll move on here in a minute,

2573
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:58,000
but for me, MXC here makes a really good point in my opinion.

2574
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
I think it kind of hits what it is for me.

2575
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:04,000
I think people still have memories of when Steam was curated at all.

2576
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:07,000
So Steam, as of today, causes annoyance.

2577
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
itch.io never attempted to gatekeep,

2578
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:12,000
and that was a huge cause for excitement with indie devs.

2579
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:15,000
With that said, itch.io does very well with highlighting

2580
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:18,000
some of their best recent releases with post and front page widgets,

2581
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
even with their own massive libraries.

2582
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
I think you said that very well, MXC.

2583
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
I do want to read this comment from Sia Tabiri as well.

2584
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Loki, I partially agree with you, but I think this might be a case of,

2585
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
I can't hold others to the same standards I would myself and my family.

2586
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:32,000
You can't fault someone else for putting out what they might believe is their best

2587
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
or what they believe is worthy of something,

2588
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:38,000
even when it's not something you would personally be willing to release.

2589
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
I understand that, but it's not her that put it out.

2590
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:41,000
It's her parents that put it out,

2591
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:44,000
because she didn't front the $100 for Steam to do all that.

2592
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,000
But that's fine. You know what? At this point, what's it going to hurt?

2593
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
I mean, honestly, it's not going to hurt anything

2594
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:52,000
because Steam is in the condition that it is.

2595
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:56,000
And to be honest, her game is probably better than a lot of the shovelwork garbage

2596
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,000
that people put out there.

2597
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:58,000
And it's not going to be mining for Bitcoin.

2598
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:59,000
And it's not mining for Bitcoin.

2599
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:02,000
So she's already ahead of the pack in that sense whatsoever.

2600
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:06,000
It's 99 cents. I shouldn't really be taking offense to it.

2601
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
And it's really, I don't take offense to the game itself.

2602
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
I take offense to Steam.

2603
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Steam as a whole is where I have problems.

2604
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
I'm going to read one more comment and then I'm going to wrap up here

2605
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
because I know Dark Soccer is going to be heading out in a minute.

2606
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,000
AkumaJP in chat says,

2607
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:21,000
If there is a place for a child to place their game, I will say put it there,

2608
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,000
but there's none, so I think she can put it there if she wants.

2609
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,000
And so I guess defer to the comment about, you know,

2610
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:30,000
you don't have a problem with the game, you have a problem with Steam.

2611
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Right.

2612
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
And it's the same problem you said at the beginning of the show.

2613
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:34,000
I get it.

2614
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Maybe they just need a separate place for, not like Greenlight was,

2615
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:40,000
but maybe just like the Steam Playground or something.

2616
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Yeah.

2617
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Steam IO. No, I'm just kidding. Don't call it that.

2618
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:46,000
At any rate, good for her though.

2619
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:49,000
And I hope that she's encouraged to do more with her success.

2620
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Exactly.

2621
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Like it's a tricky subject because you don't want to deter her

2622
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
that the issue is Steam and what it is and isn't allowing.

2623
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
The issue is not that she made a game.

2624
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Good for her.

2625
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Like I hope she will channel that into making more games

2626
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:05,000
and improving the game that she has started and continues to do that.

2627
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:08,000
So I hope that is clear in this argument.

2628
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Anyway, Dark Soccer, I know you have to head out.

2629
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Yes.

2630
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:14,000
So anything you want to say to listeners before you head out?

2631
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,000
I'm fucking tired.

2632
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:19,000
No, seriously, I've had a very busy day today

2633
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:23,000
and I've been out in the sunlight because I helped with the charity

2634
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:27,000
carwash today this morning and it was very fun.

2635
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:34,000
We made over $400 for a Nevada County HIV testing,

2636
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
which they have zero government support.

2637
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Really?

2638
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Yeah.

2639
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,000
They have no funding.

2640
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
So we've raised $400 for them.

2641
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Wow.

2642
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
And we're adding in another $100 from our local,

2643
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
you know, from the sisters.

2644
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
So we are making a nice $500 donation.

2645
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Very cool.

2646
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
I'm surprised to hear about that because that,

2647
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
we need to talk off air about some of this stuff.

2648
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Okay.

2649
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Okay.

2650
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:59,000
But at any rate, you know, it makes me feel good to do these things,

2651
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
but at the same time, I'm really freaking tired.

2652
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Sure, of course.

2653
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:05,000
So it was, yeah, and all of you guys, you know,

2654
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:08,000
I would encourage that if you feel something that, you know,

2655
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,000
very strongly about something,

2656
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:12,000
look into your local communities and see how you can help, you know,

2657
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,000
even if it's volunteering at an event for a couple of hours

2658
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:21,000
or even hosting a video game marathon to raise money for charity,

2659
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
you know, look into that.

2660
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
I'm going to be doing the same thing for my mom,

2661
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:28,000
probably in a couple of weeks to raise money for my mom.

2662
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:34,000
So, um, just if you care about your community, put your heart in it,

2663
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:37,000
put your, put your actions where your mouth is.

2664
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:38,000
All right.

2665
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
And on that note, we are going to get to one more story.

2666
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,000
I still have one more story here,

2667
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:44,000
and then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,

2668
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,000
all one word on Skype.

2669
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Before we get to Skype line, I have one more story.

2670
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
That last story took a little longer and I thought it would, uh,

2671
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:53,000
but this story is about an undiscovered, uh, Atari 2600.

2672
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
I was going to say undiscovered country.

2673
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:59,000
No, undiscovered sequel to an Atari 2600 game that has been found all

2674
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
these years later, basically.

2675
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Um, it's a prototype for Keystone Capers 2.

2676
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Do you ever play Keystone Capers on Atari 2600?

2677
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:10,000
It was the cop and robber game by Activision,

2678
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
and it's actually a really good game.

2679
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,000
It was a fun little game.

2680
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
For Atari 2600 it was a really fun game.

2681
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Well, unfortunately the prototype, it isn't really like a playable thing.

2682
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
It just kind of shows the policeman running,

2683
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:25,000
but it does show that the sequel was originally going to be set on a train.

2684
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:29,000
So it shows this train that's basically like multi-screen that, uh,

2685
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:32,000
the cop is kind of running between and the effects with like the mountain in

2686
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:35,000
the background and the scrolling with the cactuses and everything.

2687
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:38,000
The effects are pretty darn good for an Atari 2600.

2688
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Right.

2689
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:40,000
You know what I mean? So that's, that's really neat.

2690
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:43,000
So, um, yeah, basically this ended up being kind of a tech demo.

2691
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
It's not an actual playable game or anything,

2692
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:48,000
but I'm sure it's just a matter of time before this ROM hits the internet,

2693
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:52,000
since the, uh, prototype, I guess, went to the NVGM.

2694
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:53,000
I'm not sure what that acronym is,

2695
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:57,000
but I'm assuming it's some type of game museum or a, you know,

2696
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
place that, uh, archives this type of stuff.

2697
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
So that is, that is really cool.

2698
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Um, there was some information on this game a little while ago.

2699
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Um, it's just,

2700
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:08,000
this is the first time video has come out of it because I think he was

2701
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
quoted in an interview and I'm a programmer.

2702
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Dan kitchen was quoted in an interview once saying, you know,

2703
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
I did a sequel to ketone capers.

2704
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:19,000
It was a cop on a train and it was called a Keystone cannon ball was what it

2705
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:22,000
was going to be called. Um, but this is the first time we're like seeing video.

2706
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,000
And again,

2707
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:26,000
it's 2018 and we're seeing video for the first time of a game that probably

2708
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:30,000
should have been released in around 1984. So yeah, pretty cool.

2709
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Pretty cool. Anyway, with that, the Skype line is open.

2710
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

2711
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:38,000
If you'd like to give us a call about anything we've talked about tonight,

2712
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
or maybe something we haven't talked about tonight, uh,

2713
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
while we wait for a call to come in,

2714
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:45,000
I don't know if we have any quick last minute stories we want to get to Loki.

2715
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Uh, I didn't. Oh yeah.

2716
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Actually I was going to mention something as kind of a surprise this week.

2717
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:54,000
La Milana to release. No, I'm sure dark tattoo is all over that one. Yeah.

2718
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:57,000
So they, I guess announced and released it or something.

2719
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
I know I thought it was announced already. Yeah.

2720
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:02,000
They've been teasing it for awhile, but then it just kind of like came out.

2721
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
It just came out. Yeah. Cause they had a Kickstarter.

2722
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:07,000
So it's been known about for awhile. So anyway, we do have a call coming in.

2723
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Let's get to it. Hi. You're on orange laundry. Who's this? Hey, what's going on?

2724
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:13,000
It's Rama. Hey Rama. Good to hear from you. What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

2725
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Uh, not too much. Besides the fact that I hate Skype version eight,

2726
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:20,000
but that's a story and a rant for another time. Yes, I, I,

2727
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:24,000
I'm using this Skype windows XP until I can't anymore, but, uh,

2728
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
we're talking about off air.

2729
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Some of the upgrades we're going to be doing pretty soon.

2730
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,000
I'm hoping by the end of the year,

2731
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:32,000
it's going to be a very different sounding OLR than it is now.

2732
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
I hear you. I already told my staff,

2733
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:38,000
we're moving to discord for this week's show. End of story. Oh, interesting.

2734
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:39,000
You know,

2735
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:43,000
a lot of people are doing voice chat on discord and I've been asked if OLR is

2736
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:47,000
going to make a move like that. And, um, TBD.

2737
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:51,000
We'll just leave it at that. Well, there is one issue with Skype eight.

2738
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:55,000
If they fixed automatic microphone control, they fix it properly.

2739
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:58,000
We're sticking around. If not, it's getting uninstalled. Simple as that.

2740
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Yikes. I still know a lot of people that use Skype.

2741
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
I always hear this argument like nobody uses Skype,

2742
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:08,000
but I'm like all the online big brother survivor reality game stuff that I've

2743
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:12,000
played, like they're all on Skype and they all chat with Skype regularly.

2744
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Like it's a big platform and I still think tons of people are using Skype to

2745
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:19,000
like call family in another country and things like that.

2746
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Like I think Skype is still like super popular.

2747
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:25,000
It just isn't popular with the techies. I think is what's happening.

2748
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:29,000
Yeah. And tech community basically using, um,

2749
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:34,000
maybe discord, but for the most part slack and you have Microsoft teams,

2750
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:37,000
but you got to think about it. When you install windows on your PC,

2751
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:40,000
like windows 10 or windows eight, Skype is right there.

2752
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:43,000
So it was like an easy one to go to. Yeah, no, for sure.

2753
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:46,000
That's part of the reason why that's part of the reason why. Well, I mean, again,

2754
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:50,000
we, we've been taking calls on Skype since I don't want to say before anyone,

2755
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:53,000
but I really think before anyone, um,

2756
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:58,000
back in like 2003 or four was our first Skype call. So, um,

2757
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:02,000
you know, we just stuck with it. We saw no reason to leave it yet.

2758
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Yeah, basically.

2759
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:07,000
But let me say what I got to say then I'm going to get out of here so that

2760
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:11,000
other people can join in and call and have fun. Well,

2761
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:15,000
first thing, your threat of a punishment,

2762
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
you got to try harder than that. Good sir.

2763
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:25,000
I tried. Somebody, somebody out there's ears were bleeding. I don't know.

2764
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
I don't know. What am I supposed to do? We had no emails.

2765
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:32,000
I had to fill the segment somehow. This is true. This is true. And, um,

2766
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:37,000
as we all know, last weekend was the Overwatch grand finals. Yep.

2767
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Which London won, right? Yeah. I didn't watch,

2768
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:45,000
but I was actually hanging out with some of my friends actually worked the event.

2769
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Oh, fun. Yeah. Uh, one of my friends, Cassie,

2770
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:53,000
she was the official May cosplayer for the event. Oh, that's pretty cool.

2771
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Yeah. And, and our, I think her husband who works for Blizzard,

2772
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:59,000
he was part of the whole tech support team and the breakdown.

2773
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:02,000
So like Sunday me, her and a few others,

2774
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:05,000
we actually did like a little walking tour of New York city and it was kind of

2775
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:08,000
fun. Very cool. Yeah. It's,

2776
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:11,000
it's going to be interesting to see how the league continues to grow next year.

2777
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:15,000
I've heard they already, uh, have two expansions confirmed.

2778
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:18,000
One of them is going to be Atlanta. Uh, the other one is the city in China,

2779
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,000
which I do not recall the pronunciation of off the top of my heads. I apologize,

2780
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:24,000
but it's another, uh, team out of China, uh, and Atlanta.

2781
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Although I don't know if they are, I mean,

2782
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:31,000
I one place I've been a little bit critical of Overwatch league is in granted

2783
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
this is probably just a first year thing,

2784
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:36,000
but the fact that these guys, these teams don't live in the cities they

2785
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:41,000
represent, they're all in LA playing at the Blizzard LA arena. Um,

2786
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:45,000
yeah. Um, there's something about that that I, that I know. So yeah,

2787
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:48,000
that's, we'll just leave it at that. Well, I, well for what it's worth, I,

2788
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:51,000
it's, it's public and out there that that is not the longterm goal,

2789
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:55,000
that they are looking at building more arenas and that the longterm goal is it

2790
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:56,000
would be more like football or whatever,

2791
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:59,000
where these teams would be in their cities like that is something that

2792
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Blizzard's gone on record saying. So if they're making moves to do that,

2793
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:05,000
I wouldn't be surprised. I'm, I'm actually happy to hear it.

2794
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Well, that's good. I'm all for that.

2795
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:10,000
I'd like to see more teams and you know, if you remember,

2796
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:14,000
I was very critical of like esports and so forth.

2797
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:17,000
I'm starting to warm up to it.

2798
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Maybe if they had really gotten more into televising gaming events like

2799
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:27,000
this, like five, 10 years earlier, I'd be all for it.

2800
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Cause I'm sitting here thinking, you know,

2801
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:33,000
I can't see myself watching somebody play street fighter five, you know,

2802
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:37,000
whereas I will flip the channel and sit there and watch my favorite sports

2803
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:40,000
team win a game or something like that, you know?

2804
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
And, and my big thing is,

2805
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:46,000
and still continues to be is that I hope the expansion of the league will

2806
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:49,000
lead to more diversity because this is how I said,

2807
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:52,000
this is why I would like the Overwatch league to be successful.

2808
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:55,000
I'm not out here shouting, shut them down or anything.

2809
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:58,000
But the great thing about expansion is that you don't have to let anyone

2810
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:01,000
that's already there go. So these, you know,

2811
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:06,000
these white dudes that are all makeup and, and, you know,

2812
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:11,000
a lot of folks from Asia as well that play on these teams,

2813
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
none of these folks have to go anywhere,

2814
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
but maybe we could get some more women.

2815
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:18,000
I know there are more women that play Overwatch than one, you know?

2816
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:24,000
So maybe we can get some more diversity with the ethnicities and nobody who's

2817
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:27,000
currently there has to go. That's the great thing about expansions.

2818
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Again, there's something that I,

2819
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:34,000
that I was told that I have to tell you off air.

2820
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
You'll have to tell me off air. Will it make me happy or sad?

2821
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:40,000
I don't know. I know you pretty well, Rob,

2822
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:43,000
but I can't predict how you would take this type of news.

2823
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:46,000
All right. Now you got me curious now, but all right, fair enough.

2824
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Fair enough. I respect the privacy of whatever it is you got going.

2825
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:53,000
So, all right. Well, my friend, any other thoughts?

2826
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:57,000
Uh, no, that's it. I am basically getting ready for Otacon this weekend.

2827
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:00,000
So, uh, my liver is on full standby.

2828
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Have a great time. That'll be me in a few weeks getting ready for DragonCon.

2829
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:09,000
And then after that, we have to have a VoG reunion part due at MagFest.

2830
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Oh, I hope so. I would love to go to MagFest again.

2831
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
You know, MagWest is this coming weekend.

2832
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Yeah, I know.

2833
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Yeah. So, uh, we'll see. I, I may make a cameo.

2834
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Uh, one of my buddies is really trying to get me to go and I'm gonna,

2835
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:24,000
I have plans to go to San Jose for something non-related anyway.

2836
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:27,000
So I may drop in for a little bit. So we'll see.

2837
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Go for it, man.

2838
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Yeah, I just might. All right, my friend, I'm gonna let you go though.

2839
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,000
All right, you too. Take care, brother.

2840
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Take care. Bye.

2841
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:36,000
All right. Uh, let's see. I saw a couple other calls coming in.

2842
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
So let me see if we can get another one of those.

2843
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:42,000
At Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype before we wrap up here for the night.

2844
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Uh, and move on. So let's get to another call.

2845
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2846
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:49,000
Hey, what's up? It's Kaijuto.

2847
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Hey, Kaijuto. What's on your mind, buddy?

2848
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
So much. You can hear me, right?

2849
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:54,000
Yep. You are great.

2850
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Hi, you were talking earlier about, um, No Man's Sky.

2851
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Yeah.

2852
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:03,000
And how you can, um, you know, you had fun playing with Bobby Blackwolf and, uh, who was the other person? Dungeon Buster?

2853
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Yep. Dungeon Buster. My buddy Neil pops in now and then too.

2854
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:13,000
Yeah. So you said you guys are having fun, but you don't know, like, the longevity of that because you really weren't doing anything together.

2855
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:20,000
And I just wanted to remind you that there is voice chat. I think with voice chat, that opens the door to so much fun because then you can communicate.

2856
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:25,000
You're exploring together. You know, somebody might find something. They call you over to check it out.

2857
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:28,000
You know, you just take a long, kind of like stand by me in space.

2858
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:35,000
I guess. Like, you know, and maybe things that have happened to me, like when the biological horrors showed up and I started screaming on my stream.

2859
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Like if Bobby, if Bobby had been there too, when I did that, uh, then at least there would have been two of us to take them on.

2860
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:49,000
And maybe that's the trick to doing that stuff a little easier is to bring some friends along to zap those aliens down since you kind of know what you're in for.

2861
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Um, so maybe, you know, maybe there is some stuff. I just kind of feel like,

2862
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Not just zap, but I just mean that communication aspect.

2863
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Yeah, for sure. And since we've been streaming, when we play online together, we do talk and you know that again, it was fun.

2864
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:10,000
And I'm not saying like, you know, it's just when you kind of start to play the game on your own, you're really kind of exploring the story.

2865
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:16,000
You find that a lot of it is about how much have you explored? How many words have you learned?

2866
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:28,000
How many things, you know, and it does seem like you're still kind of in a solo, a story, which if I, if the spoilers from the first iteration of the game still hold true about what the whole thing kind of ends up being at the end,

2867
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:42,000
I could see how it's kind of like a solo experience, but I mean, there's nothing wrong with like kind of sharing with that with other people, but I'm just like, I don't see myself playing through this with somebody by my side for the entirety 60 hours or whatever it takes to get through the story. You know what I mean?

2868
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:55,000
I get you. But like, the way I see it is like, you know, I go back to when I was a kid and, you know, I used to get games like Monopoly and Clue and now, no, what the fuck did you not understand the rules, couldn't comprehend the rules.

2869
02:22:55,000 --> 02:23:01,000
I'm like six or seven trying to do like D&D and I'm just like, fuck it. And me and my friends just made up our own game.

2870
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:09,000
And I think that sometimes with some games, you don't need to just play the solo mode. Just like I said, like explore, communicate with each other, just kind of make your own game.

2871
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Yeah, that's a fair perspective. I bet people are making, you know, No Man's Sky is a sandbox of sorts and I bet people are making their own games out of it.

2872
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:22,000
You know, I think, aren't they supposed to have like racing and stuff that comes to the game eventually? I don't know.

2873
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:23,000
I thought that they mentioned that.

2874
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:29,000
I tuned into a random stream and some dude was driving a car. So I know that's a thing that I just haven't unveiled yet.

2875
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Yeah, they have vehicles.

2876
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:34,000
I didn't even know that was a thing until I watched some random Twitch. So there's more.

2877
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Yeah, there's more yet. Okay, Dungeon Busters confirms there's a racing track module.

2878
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:49,000
So that would be fun. So I think there's just, there's still more to discover. But yeah, I think it's, it's probably the sandbox versus the story of the game.

2879
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:57,000
I don't think the story of the game is really going to be that great with the multiple people, but the sandbox element, absolutely. The racing track stuff will be fun.

2880
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Yeah, and as far as you know, there aren't any space battleships. I mean, I know that you fight in space for like, teaming up with each other.

2881
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:12,000
I don't know how that works yet. I know you fight space pirates, but I don't know if you can team up with others to fight the space pirates.

2882
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Yeah, I remember it was that thing we asked. But yeah, that's, that's what I want to go out and just want to remind you that, you know, you can communicate and I have all types of fun.

2883
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Because I mean, I play a lot of games online, and people are so fucking quiet in space, it's just like, no one talks no more.

2884
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:27,000
No, I see.

2885
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Unless they're like, some kind of party chat maybe, but I mean, it's very rare.

2886
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:36,000
No, I mean, I appreciate the other perspective. You're right, sometimes the game is kind of what you make it, in a way.

2887
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:43,000
And that's, especially with a sandbox game like Minecraft, like No Man's Sky, like, you know, a lot of games are out there right now.

2888
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:46,000
It is what you make it, so.

2889
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
All right, my friend, take care.

2890
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Yeah, anytime. Take care, buddy. Bye.

2891
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:57,000
All right, that is going to wrap us up for tonight, because I have some plans after the show.

2892
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:02,000
So sorry to those that didn't get through, but you can always email us. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2893
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
Because, you know, we're not getting emails.

2894
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
Or you can always tweet us at OLR.

2895
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:10,000
That's a Twitter name I will not be changing, and I'm going to hold on to that three-letter Twitter name with dear life.

2896
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:14,000
I may have given up a four-letter Twitter name, but I'm not giving up a three-letter one.

2897
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
Anyway, that's going to do it for another episode of the show.

2898
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:19,000
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening tonight.

2899
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:23,000
As I always say at the end of every show, if you enjoyed what you heard here tonight, please tell a friend or two about the show.

2900
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Help us spread a word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2901
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:30,000
But if the voices aren't here to air, well, what are we supposed to do?

2902
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:33,000
I hope those of you that went to EVO had a good time.

2903
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:40,000
I hope everybody that's been sitting at home gaming, whether it's No Man's Sky or building your own games or whatever,

2904
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
I hope you've been having a good time as well.

2905
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

2906
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Oh, I forgot to mention the five-star reviews wherever you pick this show up.

2907
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:52,000
iTunes, Google Play, those go a long way.

2908
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Although I guess somebody was telling me you can't actually rate things on Google Play. I thought you could.

2909
02:25:56,000 --> 02:26:01,000
And somebody had asked about Stitcher, so I haven't mentioned this in a while.

2910
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:11,000
I did ask OLR to be removed from Stitcher some time ago, because their podcast refreshing feed was not staying current.

2911
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:17,000
The show was months out of date, and nothing was changing, and they were doing nothing about it.

2912
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
So when I got emails from Stitcher people that were like,

2913
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Why aren't you putting on any episodes? I said Stitcher is not representing our show the way it should be represented, and so I had it pulled.

2914
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
So that's why we're not on Stitcher.

2915
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:33,000
So I can recommend every podcast player out there except one.

2916
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Sorry, I know that one's pretty popular, but I'm sticking to it.

2917
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:44,000
You've got to accurately reflect. If your niche is going to be delivering podcasts, you need to deliver podcasts.

2918
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Anyhow, not to dwell in a negative space, but you guys deserve to know the truth.

2919
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
I'm not going to sugarcoat it. That's what it is.

2920
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:54,000
All right, let's get final thoughts. Loki, your final thoughts.

2921
02:26:54,000 --> 02:27:00,000
I'm going to have to start a new game now that I finished the one I was working on.

2922
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:01,000
All right.

2923
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:07,000
I don't know. It'll probably be along the same lines, just not the way they did it.

2924
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:10,000
I was going to say, you should make the one you did better.

2925
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:15,000
I can, but I can only do so much with that. I already have an idea.

2926
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:23,000
I don't want to do my grand, grand, grand idea that I had that was along the same lines, but maybe something smaller.

2927
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:24,000
So we'll see.

2928
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Well, at least I can tell Bobby, I have seen a game that Loki has done.

2929
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:36,000
It's very basic, but it's there. You did it.

2930
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:41,000
We did it this time with the car as well, but that never got released.

2931
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:45,000
Well, yeah, but you didn't, you didn't, and you still had unfinished stuff.

2932
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:46,000
I always start that over and then...

2933
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:49,000
There you go. There you go. All right.

2934
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:53,000
Anyway, uh, let's see. That is, uh, that's going to do it for tonight's OLR.

2935
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:59,000
My final thought tonight is, um, I need to, I need to spin some pokestops today. It's getting late.

2936
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:02,000
All right, that's going to do it. Thank you guys so much for listening to the show tonight.

2937
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:06,000
I appreciate it as always. We'll be back in seven days to do it all again with episode 741.

2938
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Until then, happy gaming. Be nice to each other online and shake hands at the end of it. Bye.

2939
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:45,000
See you next week.

2940
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Bye.
