27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	45000	Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 742. For this, August 19th of 2018.
46000	54000	I'm Rob Roberts joined here in studio, studio N7 in Sacramento, California with my co-host, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
54000	55000	Hello.
55000	56000	Hi, how are you, Loki?
56000	57000	Good.
57000	58000	Good. You had a good week?
58000	59000	Yeah, it was alright.
59000	60000	Yeah, it was okay? Just okay? Just alright?
60000	61000	It was just alright, yes.
61000	74000	Okay, that's good. I had a pretty good weekend. Well, I had like some good stuff and some not so good stuff. So I went to San Francisco and I went to a concert. So probably nobody's ever heard of this artist but her name is Joanna Lee.
74000	87000	And she used to have like a band project called I Am Emma Who Am I? So maybe like two people out there have heard of this. So I went and saw the concert. It was great because I never like, you know, she's Swedish and probably doesn't, I think it's the first time she's ever toured in San Francisco.
87000	98000	I just on a whim found out about this concert. Like Spotify does like the whole like, hey, you listen to this artist a lot. You might want to know that they're coming to town. So I was like, bless you Spotify. Yes, I would like to know that.
98000	110000	So we bought tickets last week. We went and had a good time at the show, got to see our pal JD, stayed with him. Unfortunately, the next day coming home, oh boy, like traffic was terrible.
111000	124000	I took the wrong on-ramp onto the freeway because I was trying to like listen to Waze and stuff. You know how like Waze will sometimes be like in 1000 feet, take the on-ramp on the right. And it's like, I'm not exactly sure how far 1000 feet is, but I see an on-ramp right there.
124000	128000	Oh, that's the wrong on-ramp. Oh, great. Oh, it's bumper to bumper.
128000	136000	I installed Waze this week and then I looked at it and I'm like, no, no, I don't want this. And then I immediately uninstalled it.
136000	148000	There's some things I really like about Waze like the traffic updates, but some other people I know swear by the Google, which is weird that they're separate apps because my understanding is Google bought Waze, but Google has their own navigation app.
148000	160000	And the pros on that app is that it tells you like, get in the farthest right hand lane to make a left turn. Like it'll tell you what like lane to be in so that you can make your transitions easier. And I think that's great.
161000	172000	Yeah. And I do like that. And it does give me traffic updates and stuff like that. So that's nice. But I wanted something that most of the navigation apps, they will say, OK, take this street. It's always the main streets.
172000	186000	I'm like, there's traffic here. I want you to reroute me through the fucking neighborhoods if it's faster. And they don't do that. They just say, oh, sit in traffic and like, well, if I just go this way, which I know is faster, I'm going to be ahead of the traffic.
186000	195000	And yeah, I want and that's why I thought Waze was. I thought Waze was, oh, OK, this might be a little bit different where it's going to be a little bit more, you know, crowd sourced or whatever.
195000	205000	It is crowd sourced. It's it's it's hit and miss because sometimes the problem is it'll put you on the back roads because it knows that, you know, the freeway is crowded or whatever.
205000	212000	But then what the problem is, is it hasn't accurately measured all the traffic on the back roads yet. So you're stuck in traffic on the back roads. So it's like that's the.
212000	220000	But then, you know, it's like traffic is screwed up everywhere. What can you do? So but anyway, then so not just it was traffic.
220000	230000	Then we stop at a Starbucks and they like completely forgot to like make my drink, even though which is funny because Alan ordered two drinks and the sticker on his drink says drink two of two.
230000	235000	And it's like, OK, where did the sticker go? The machine prints out like, how did this happen?
235000	247000	So it was just kind of one of those because I wanted to get home in time to do to get to a meeting for the Rocky Horror Crowd because there's a show next week and I like to get everybody's stage names and get everything prepped for that in advance.
247000	254000	So I ended up being super late to that. And so and then I get home and I find out, oh, I left one of my two cell phones in San Francisco. Great.
254000	260000	Yes, I have more than one cell phone. And of course, the one I left behind is the one I really need Monday to Friday.
260000	267000	So I'm just I'm just going to have to suck it up and not have it on Monday while it gets FedEx to me. And then I got to eat the cost that FedEx.
267000	277000	So it's like I did not have the best like resolution to the weekend, but at least I'm home, at least I'm healthy, at least I got to see an artist I really like in concert.
277000	286000	And I had got Alan and I hadn't been out to like a concert date in a long time. You know, I think the last band we saw live was erasure in the 80s.
286000	291000	No, I'm just kidding. It was but it was erasure, which, of course, was a big synth pop band in the 80s and 90s.
291000	304000	The last band that I saw live was it. And I know I don't think it was there was a tour that I saw one time, too.
304000	310000	I think the last band I saw live was Third Eye Blind. Oh, my gosh. Was that like in the 90s?
310000	319000	No, it wasn't in the 90s. It was actually 2000s. It was one of those one of these things where my work used to raffle off tickets for like because they had box seats or whatever.
319000	328000	And so it was just like, here you got picked. You know, I didn't even enter. It's like, here you got picked. I'm like, all right.
328000	335000	OK, they're really blind. Yeah, that's cool. Have I ever told this story? I swear it's a video game podcast. We'll get there eventually.
335000	342000	Have I ever told the story on OLR about the time I won backstage passes to meet Matchbox 20 in like 1997 or something?
342000	343000	That's hilarious.
343000	351000	Oh, yeah. No, I won tickets. Like, I legit won a radio contest, ironically enough. I won one of those. Like, be the 15th caller.
351000	359000	Who knew that stuff was real? I called and I won and I got tickets and backstage passes to see Matchbox 20 and I got to meet them.
359000	369000	This is like in 1987. And I took one of my lady friends who was like, you know, because, you know, sometimes, especially like in the teenage years, even the early 20s and stuff.
369000	376000	And heck, gosh, I know women in their 40s that still get excited when Backstreet Boys goes on tour. But hey, I get excited when Spice Girls go on tour and I wish they would again.
376000	384000	So I get it. But yeah, so I took one of my lady friends who was like really into the band and she was like shaking and crying and doing that whole thing.
384000	391000	So it was really it was fun. It was a lot of fun. And then leaving the concert, I got into my first automobile accident that totaled my first car.
391000	397000	How's that for a happy ending to that story? So, gosh, concerts seem to be bad. Like, I'll have a really good time with the concert.
397000	403000	And then, like, I have these really horrible resolutions to this story, so maybe I shouldn't go to any more concerts.
403000	408000	Yeah, we didn't have anything bad happen at Third Eye Blind. The only thing that was bad was Third Eye Blind.
408000	415000	Actually, no, they're great. I mean, they're fine. No issues with them. It's better than like...
415000	417000	It was a lovely time, I'm sure.
417000	426000	I know there was one time I went to a country music concert, too. I don't even remember who it was. That's how memorable it was because I just didn't give a shit anymore.
426000	435000	But why did I even go to that? I think that was with my parents. That must have been with my parents. I got dragged along to something because I would have never voluntarily gone to...
435000	438000	I don't even remember who it was. I just remember country music.
438000	447000	I would say the most, like, randomly, awesomely obscure concert that I ever went to that, like, not many people can probably say they've seen live.
447000	452000	This is my music hipster thing. But I went to a radio festival one year. This is around the same year, Smashbox 20 stuff.
452000	458000	Get this. The band that was playing that I couldn't wait to see was the Vengaboys. You remember the Vengaboys?
458000	459000	Yes.
460000	463000	Come on. Those of you that listen to...
463000	465000	It's all Eurodance. That's what we used to enjoy.
465000	470000	If y'all played DDR, you know the Vengaboys, because I'm really surprised that music was never in DDR.
470000	474000	Or I think it was in the Europe dancing stage or whatever. But anyway, it doesn't matter.
474000	478000	Captain Jack and stuff, that's all Eurodance.
478000	484000	They had a live concert here in Sacramento as part of a big radio festival with like...
484000	488000	Who else was there? It was one of the new kids on the block, like Jordan Knight or one of them.
488000	490000	And Shaggy. You remember Shaggy?
490000	491000	Yes.
493000	499000	That was a good time. I think the Vengaboys maybe ever only played like three shows in the United States, and that was one of them.
499000	502000	So that's my little, like, randomly awesome obscure story.
502000	507000	Alright, going to our chat. I do want to introduce our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
507000	510000	because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network.
510000	516000	vognetwork.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
516000	520000	And Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers, she is on a little break from the show.
520000	523000	We talked about this last week if you want to hear all the details about that.
523000	529000	But of course, she will be here during the middle part of the show to talk about the classic game of the week.
529000	532000	But we talked a little bit about that last week, so she'll be gone for a few months.
532000	537000	I guess I have to kind of say at the start of every show, you know, Jamie's not here because her name's in the intro.
537000	539000	She's not here, so it's going to be that way, sadly, for a little bit.
539000	547000	But she will be here some shows. I think she's making plans to be here, not this month, but the end, maybe one other show in September.
547000	549000	I don't know. We'll figure out the dates a little later.
549000	551000	But I want to get to you guys in chat.
551000	559000	And Bobby Black Wolf in chat starting us off saying, targeted advertising works, talking about the alert that I saw for I am, am I, who am I.
559000	565000	Yeah, I don't mind being advertised to when it's stuff like that, when it's like, did you know about this?
565000	569000	And it's actually something like I really do want to know about.
569000	574000	Like, sometimes I'll be on Facebook and it's like, did you know about the Underwear of the Month Club?
574000	577000	And I'm like, I don't, whatever. But like, this was something.
577000	581000	Oh, I had one of those last night. Like, they're random. Like, I don't know what it is.
581000	585000	Half of them, usually it's like from Wish or something. It's like, who would wish for this?
585000	590000	Some of those guys are big podcast sponsors, so I'm not going to name them because they're not sponsoring this show.
590000	594000	So as far as I'm concerned, you can go get Fruit of the Loom because they're not sponsoring this show.
594000	600000	I don't remember who it was, but it was like, I saw, like the first picture was like, it was this giant bunk bed thing and it was enormous.
600000	605000	Like, I'm like, if I put that in my son's room, that's just going to take up like literally the whole room. That's ridiculous.
605000	612000	But then I scrolled to the site and they have like different duvets and stuff and they had one that looked like somebody got murdered on this.
612000	621000	It's like, why would you put that in your room? It's like blood stains everywhere. I'm like, why would you do that?
621000	625000	Why was the purpose of this? Is that the same website that has the crack pipes for sale?
625000	631000	Maybe. I don't know. But like it was just, it was on the ad. I'm like, this is the most random stupid thing I've ever seen.
631000	637000	Okay. Other comments from chat. Bobby Bleckle says, I love Waze. There you go.
637000	644000	Raginator says, I've heard of ABBA, Ace of Base and Roxette, but not that Swedish artist that you mentioned that you named.
644000	647000	Well, now you have another one to go look up a little more, a little more modern.
647000	652000	But those are all good bands that you named Raginator. It's very, very well done. It was good.
652000	657000	Let's see. Go into some other comments in chat at live.vognetwork.com.
657000	663000	Let's see. MegamanX400 says, the last concert I saw was Britney in Vegas.
663000	671000	Okay. First off, I'm jealous. But second off, is that really a concert or is that a performance?
671000	679000	Like, Loki, if I were to go see a street mime perform, is that a concert or is that a performance?
679000	686000	Because we all know Britney ain't singing, you guys. She's, she's pantomiming her way through that with elaborate,
686000	692000	but obviously any, anybody who buys a ticket to Britney full on knows that and is completely okay with that fact.
692000	697000	I'm sure she's more entertaining than a mime. So, you know, that's true. She is more entertaining.
697000	701000	I would rather stare at her for two hours than a mime, so.
701000	707000	Let's see. SG100Matt says, you went to MAGFest concerts and nothing bad happened. There's something.
707000	712000	The bad thing that happened is that I haven't been back in a long time. That's the sad thing.
712000	717000	Let's see. And some folks talking about Vengaboys and a dancing stage and all this stuff.
717000	723000	Kaijuto asking, is Dark Soccer on maternity leave? No. No, it's a, it's a work conflict.
723000	729000	We, we got into it last week. Sadly, it's a work conflict. And somebody else explained that in chat at live.vognetwork.com.
729000	737000	Let's see. Oh, oh, here's a random concert answer for you guys. Fifth Dream in chat says, speaking of lip syncing,
737000	746000	I saw Milli Vanilli live. No lie. Wow. That's, you win, sir. You win. That's, that's a hell of a thing to see live.
746000	751000	Talk about pantomiming. That's, that's amazing. What if the twist was that Milli Vanilli really did sing live?
751000	756000	What if like that was the twist? I don't know. Anyway. All right. We got to get into some video games.
756000	761000	Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic. So this is a big piece of gaming news a lot of people are talking about this week.
761000	767000	And that is that Diablo three has been confirmed for the switch. Have you been reading about this, Logie?
767000	773000	I saw the video. You did? That looked weird. Like it, like it sounded like it leaked out and then. Okay.
773000	777000	So they had to release the thing. Like it's supposed to be part of a direct or something.
777000	783000	Yeah. Okay. So here's the thing is that the information was published early on a website.
783000	788000	I believe it was Forbes publishes, which I thought Forbes was all the blogs. I didn't think they did news.
788000	792000	Or am I mixing it up with another website? Starts with F. I don't know. Anyway, so whatever.
792000	796000	So somehow they had the information and this has happened before.
796000	801000	We have seen big websites that had information that was under embargo. But, you know,
801000	805000	sometimes they will set the posting time and date and it gets set wrong.
805000	811000	Computer error happens. So for whatever reason, it publishes and the minute it hits the Internet, y'all.
811000	814000	It's done. It's out there. That's why these websites have to be careful.
814000	818000	So I'm sure Forbes got a little bit of a nasty gram from Nintendo and Blizzard.
818000	824000	But at the same time, this shit happens. Like, you know, it's you know, things are going to leak out.
824000	830000	Also, I mean, it was this Diablo three on Switch thing's been going around for a long time.
830000	833000	We talked about last week. Yeah, I think I really think we did.
833000	838000	So it's just you finally had the confirmation. And what really sold it was that they had screen shots posted.
838000	844000	Like there were screen shots of like Ganon armor and like Zelda related things in the game.
844000	849000	And they were on Forbes. So it wasn't like somebody's like Tumblr fan art or something like that.
849000	855000	It was which again. But but does doesn't Forbes sometimes publish Tumblr fan art?
855000	862000	I don't know. Anyway. So anyhow, maybe they said so then all these other websites start posting things that say,
862000	871000	well, Forbes, and with no bitterness at all, Forbes has announced early there's a leak, you know, that Diablo three is happening.
871000	875000	And so we all know it's happening. The next day, it's confirmed.
875000	882000	And they put out this video that shows Reggie Fils-Aime calling Mike Morhaime from Blizzard.
882000	886000	And they're kind of talking and have a little bit of banner. And then they kind of get into the game.
886000	890000	But here's the OK. So here's the thing about the trailer. And I talked about this a little bit on Twitter.
890000	898000	That little video that they did was cut really weird. Like it was really hastily edited for me.
898000	905000	And like there's a lot of other things that didn't add up to me. For example, there's this running gag with the light switch.
905000	909000	Like Reggie Fils-Aime goes, what's that? What's what? The lights are flickering. What's that all about?
909000	916000	And I don't know. Some people theorized it was because, well, you know, back in February,
916000	920000	the official Diablo Twitter posted a picture of a light switch.
920000	924000	And that's where all these Diablo three on switch rumors started to begin with.
924000	929000	And I'm like, OK, that's a little bit of a stretch to have Reggie Fils-Aime act.
929000	936000	That's a little bit of a stretch. I mean, I realize Reggie Fils-Aime has kind of become a meme king in some.
936000	939000	But that meme, that's a little bit of a stretch. I don't know about that one.
939000	943000	He hasn't been put in the smash yet. That would make him the meme king.
943000	946000	You know, wait for it. I'm waiting for it.
946000	953000	Let me ask. OK. OK, I'll ask this now. We get on Tantra sometimes. It happens. I'll come back to this direct thing in a minute.
953000	965000	Would it be in good taste or would it be in bad taste to put the former CEO of Nintendo in the game?
965000	973000	Would that be in good taste, a tribute, or would that be in bad taste because he passed?
973000	979000	Just I don't know. I know. Right. Tricky, tricky moral quandary.
979000	985000	Is it a tribute or is it an insult? Just put him in the alleged rumored mode that there may be.
985000	990000	Just kind of curious. Here he is. All right.
990000	996000	OK, so anyway, back to the back to the issue at hand. So so we were talking about the trailer.
996000	1003000	OK, so not only that, but then towards the end of the thing, when they were transitioning into the full Diablo three trailer, the light switch does a weird thing.
1003000	1009000	Again, you hear this growl, but they show like the Diablo three stock photo and it does this really weird pan.
1009000	1015000	It's just edited really weird. And then it's like that they were talking about their online service.
1015000	1018000	Yeah, like cut all the information about their online service.
1018000	1025000	So and then Mike Morehame and Reggie are talking and they say, let's patch in the fans and they do this weird transition.
1025000	1029000	And that to me was the like one of the oddest things in the whole thing was like, what do you mean?
1029000	1036000	Let's patch in the fans like that's a weird like I get that they had this whole like set up like they were doing a fakie online call and stuff.
1036000	1041000	It was just I don't know. Like, why do you go out of your way to drop a line like that?
1041000	1047000	It seems like like a line like that. Believe me, when you have these Nintendo directs and stuff, everything is scripted.
1047000	1052000	Everything is down to the letter branding, branding, branding. There's no improv in any of this stuff.
1052000	1059000	This is why Nintendo switched to directs and doesn't do the live stuff anymore so that they can control everything.
1059000	1064000	Right. So although I guess they did do a live review over the switch, so it's not 100 percent right.
1064000	1073000	But anyway, my point is that video really felt like it was clipped out of a larger Nintendo direct about something else, namely online play.
1073000	1077000	Now, here's the complication, though, that's come up since I wrote all those tweets.
1077000	1083000	And actually, when Bobby talked about on his show, I didn't didn't didn't know this part because I hadn't said anything about it yet.
1083000	1099000	So here's the other thing. Folks are saying on Twitter, including Kotaku in their news article, including some rumbles around like, you know, Blizzard and all that stuff is that the information was supposed to be released the next day.
1099000	1106000	So the day they actually unveiled it was always going to be the day that they officially announced Diablo three on switch.
1106000	1112000	And I think Gamescom has something to do with that because it is going to be playable at Gamescom.
1112000	1117000	So it was always meant to be that day. But I don't know, y'all.
1117000	1125000	Like, it's not that I don't believe that it wasn't meant to be announced that day, especially if Blizzard did want to take it to Gamescom and they did want to show it off and all this stuff.
1125000	1133000	But that doesn't still change my opinion that that little trailer that we got, that video that we got feels like a piece of something else.
1133000	1139000	And maybe there will be a Nintendo direct and we're going to see that exact same clip, but inserted in a Nintendo direct.
1139000	1145000	And I know this is very tinfoil hatty type of thing, but I mean, on the other hand, it totally makes sense.
1145000	1154000	If you're going to do a Nintendo direct that's focused on online and why your fans should pay this money to have an online service,
1154000	1157000	because you know there's people complaining out there right now.
1157000	1162000	Why do I have to pay for something that you're already doing for free? This is double dipping.
1162000	1168000	You guys have all heard it. Y'all know it's out there. Whether you feel the same or you feel different, you know this is out there right now.
1168000	1173000	So Nintendo's going to do a direct to try to justify to people why they're going to pay that amount.
1173000	1183000	So I mean, you know, didn't this kind of feel like it doesn't a Diablo 3 play with your friends online announcement really feel like something that would have been a logical part of a direct like that?
1183000	1185000	Yes, it really does. Yeah, it does.
1185000	1189000	So are they doing anything during E3 or not E3 Gamescom?
1189000	1198000	Blizzard is Nintendo, I don't think they have anything official?
1198000	1204000	They may have a booth, but I don't think there's any like planned announcements or anything.
1204000	1211000	But to be fair, they don't really do all they do. They do an E3 direct, but they're not doing anything at E3 besides a booth.
1211000	1216000	Well, I take that back because they have their Smash tournaments now. They brought back Nintendo World Championships.
1216000	1219000	So I guess they do have any sort of direct announced or anything.
1219000	1221000	So not yet, but lately when they...
1221000	1226000	How long are we going to wait for this online service direct? I mean, come on, like seriously.
1226000	1233000	Nintendo has never, well, I shouldn't say never, but in the past couple of years, as far back as I can remember, which in internet time is not a very long time.
1233000	1238000	Nintendo has never given you three weeks notice on a direct. They've never done that.
1239000	1248000	As far back as my memory goes, what they do, they say, tomorrow, Nintendo Direct 4 p.m. be there and people will be there.
1248000	1254000	So they're not going to announce it until the day before because they never do. Like this is just how they roll now.
1254000	1263000	They need to talk about what's in their online service because they're already taking pre-orders for their online service. So I think that's fair.
1264000	1273000	Mega Man X400 in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Nintendo is really dragging their feet on announcing this online. What is the holdup at this point?
1273000	1275000	Are they worried someone's going to steal their idea?
1276000	1280000	You guys, you just want to get pieces of this online business as well.
1283000	1290000	See, here's the thing. They've kind of officially announced it though. And there's been a social media push this week to really show like here's all the stuff you can expect.
1291000	1299000	But I think where people feel like Nintendo hasn't really announced it, even though they've tweeted about it, they've posted on Facebook, they say this is coming.
1299000	1302000	They haven't told you all the games.
1302000	1313000	Or what it looks like. Here's what the online service looks like. Here's Mario Brothers. And look, we're playing two layers. And here's how it looks when you connect with your friends.
1313000	1321000	Here's the interface for this whole thing. Yeah, Nintendo has not really peeled back the curtain on the intricacies, the user's manual on how this is all going to work.
1321000	1327000	And what is unfortunately happening, and this has been happening for a long time, is that people are filling in the gaps.
1327000	1334000	You know, people are saying, oh, well, Nintendo is waiting to show their online system so that they can show us how the achievement system works.
1334000	1344000	There's not going to be an achievement system. Nintendo has watched me eat those words later, but whatever. I'll own it if I have to.
1344000	1345000	Does it matter at this point?
1345000	1348000	Yeah, it doesn't matter at this point. It's gone this long.
1348000	1349000	It's like so late to the game.
1349000	1357000	Yeah. People feel like, even though Nintendo's kind of announced some stuff online, they haven't gone over it with a fine-tooth comb.
1357000	1370000	They have not explained it in the Smash Brothers Direct level of detail where they're like, we took the number of frames in this person's B button move and we've reduced it.
1370000	1378000	The Smash Brothers Directs get really in-depth. Really in-depth so people know what to expect. And we haven't kind of had that yet. I don't know.
1378000	1391000	Anyway. Let's see. Going to chat at live.vognetwork.com. S2100matt talking about the Diablo 3 trailer says, from an editing standpoint, I believe it's part of a grander Direct because it's awkward thematically.
1391000	1400000	My guess is the lights could be a running gag in the Direct. I get the sense this was done recently and still being worked on. Thanks, Forbes. Which is why those transitions seem off.
1400000	1404000	Yeah, just something doesn't add up about that whole video. I don't know.
1404000	1420000	Anyway. Let's see. Other comments in chat at live.vognetwork.com. HaloAddictMan, who I think is BreakMan in chat, says, if you are expecting Nintendo to suddenly give you Sony Online quality, that's on you, not them.
1421000	1429000	TigerClaw in chat says, watch. Nintendo will force players to pay for Nintendo's Online service just to play the new Smash Brothers Online against other players.
1429000	1442000	That is happening. And to be fair to Nintendo, they are giving ample warning on that. Even if you look at the box for things like Splatoon, it's in tiny print.
1442000	1453000	But it says, online play available, paid online will be required with the start of Nintendo's Online service in, I think at that time it was still summer of 2018.
1453000	1466000	So honestly guys, these last few months have been a gift. Because Nintendo's Online service was supposed to be like a year ago. So all this free Splatooning you guys have been doing has been a gift.
1466000	1479000	So, yeah. I mean, I don't think you could accurately accuse Nintendo of blindsiding us with this. They have been stating this on their games. Go look at the game boxes of what you're buying.
1479000	1490000	Even the fine print that you probably scroll through real quick on the digital purchases that you buy. It says something about Nintendo's Online services being required as of probably an earlier date than now.
1490000	1502000	But Nintendo can say, oh well, we told you it was going to be earlier. We're waiving the fee for the whatever lovey-dovey thing they want to say to kind of ease that over a little bit.
1502000	1514000	So, anything. Anyway. Now, one other thing I want to get into with this deal. Because this Diablo thing, even though it's something that's been rumored for a long time, it's got all these interesting elements to it.
1514000	1534000	Like, the timing of the announcement. Is it a part of Nintendo's bigger Online strategy? And then there's this other part about it where now that you have Blizzard putting Diablo 3 on a Nintendo console, which is the first time Blizzard's done something with a Nintendo console since, what, like Lost Vikings on Super Nintendo?
1535000	1549000	Did they do anything on Nintendo 64? I don't... Yeah, but you'd have to go way back. You'd have to go way back. Like, at least 20 years. You'd have to go back to find the last time Blizzard... And they were probably still, what was it, Synapse and whatever their old name was.
1549000	1551000	Starcraft was on 64, according to chat.
1551000	1559000	Oh, that's right! There was a Starcraft 64. Thank you guys. And they were working on Starcraft... No, Starcraft Ghost was a PS2 thing, I think. Anyway.
1559000	1563000	You're right. Starcraft was on N64. That was probably the last time Blizzard did something on a console.
1563000	1577000	So now people are asking, you know, and this is not something that is unheard of, well, if Blizzard is now doing stuff on Nintendo again, where is Hearthstone? Where is Overwatch?
1578000	1593000	An interesting comment on all of this, though, is that, I guess they've actually, Blizzard has kind of, like, talked about this a little bit, saying that, well, Overwatch is feasible, but Starcraft 2 is going to be difficult on the Switch.
1593000	1602000	But that's interesting. So, it was an interview with GameSpot, with senior producer at Blizzard, Pete Stillwell, where he said,
1602000	1612000	Anything is within the realm of possibility. Our team was given the task to work on this, Diablo 3. If Team 4, the Overwatch developer, picks up that endeavor, that's on them.
1612000	1624000	As of right now, Diablo is our only focus on Switch. Yes, it is feasible. So this has all of the Overwatch fans and all the Nintendo Switch owners doing that whole Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber.
1624000	1631000	So you're saying there's a chance. Am I right? That's what everybody's doing. So you're saying there's a chance.
1631000	1643000	Because all they have to do is port the console version over. They don't have to rebuild it to work with the Switch. Whereas a game like Starcraft, which is not built for a console system, they would have to retool that.
1643000	1658000	Even though you just said the original was on Nintendo 64. Dude, and how well did it play? And how well did it play? It was so great. Just like Command and Conquer Red Alert was on PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 1, and that was so fucking awesome.
1658000	1669000	That's my favorite version of the game. To be fair, the same senior producer had something to say about that. The N64 version of Starcraft was cool, but you had to change the game quite a bit to make it work properly on console.
1669000	1678000	Starcraft 2 is next level requirements for how much dexterity you need with a mouse and keyboard, so I think that would have been a very difficult port. It would have to change the core gameplay.
1678000	1689000	So when it comes to Starcraft, I'm not hearing there's a chance at all. That's not gonna happen. But it's interesting that the door got left open to crack on Overwatch and now everybody's screaming and hooping and hollering about it.
1689000	1703000	What about World of Warcraft? On the Switch, though? I just don't think that's the game to put on the Switch. I don't know. But then again, Final Fantasy XIV is great on PlayStation 4.
1703000	1720000	Put that on the Switch. I would go for that. But the problem is, this is where you get into a weird area with Final Fantasy XIV specifically. Final Fantasy XIV went out of their way to announce to the fanbase and brace themselves,
1720000	1733000	we are ending PlayStation 3 support. And they already did that last year when they released Stormblood. They ended PlayStation 3 support. And the reason why they did it was that they wanted to push the graphics, they wanted to push everything to the next level.
1733000	1744000	Yeah, the 3 would no longer support it. So everything is on the PlayStation 4 or PC. So the problem is, if you now introduce the Switch into it, well the Switch is not quite as powerful as a PlayStation 4.
1745000	1756000	So even though it's way more powerful than PlayStation 3, you're going to have to probably lower the bar to get the Switch owners in. So I just don't think Final Fantasy XIV is going to happen on Switch for that reason.
1756000	1774000	Unless, in a couple of years, we get a Switch DX. Because you know Nintendo will do it. Why not? They've done it with Game Boys. They've done it with other stuff. Why not repackage the Switch and give it a deluxe version with some extra oomph in it?
1774000	1777000	Because they didn't do that with their last few console systems.
1777000	1780000	Well, but the Switch is no longer just a console.
1780000	1783000	It's not like a handheld system though. I don't think they will.
1783000	1793000	Depends on your experience. DungeonBuster though points out Wolfenstein 2 and Doom are graphically demanding, but they managed to get it on the Switch. So who knows?
1793000	1796000	Yeah, but the only, well yeah, I guess.
1796000	1804000	S2100Matt points out Crossplay would be nice for Overwatch. That would be pretty awesome if they said, you know, that would be an interesting little alliance.
1804000	1815000	If Nintendo, they came out and said, Overwatch is coming out on the Switch and you can play with your friends on Xbox One. Thanks to a special agreement between us and Microsoft.
1815000	1818000	But fuck you Sony, because there ain't no agreement there.
1818000	1824000	Well, but you know what's going to happen is, oh well we invited Sony, but they didn't want to. You know that'll happen.
1824000	1827000	Well fuck them. I mean, they don't want to come to the table. I'm telling you.
1827000	1839000	But the weird thing when it comes to Overwatch specifically and the whole online is that Blizzard is the one keeping Crossplay out between PC and console.
1839000	1844000	Because I'm positive Microsoft would have no problem doing PC and Xbox. They have no problem with that.
1845000	1855000	But Blizzard wants that separated because of keyboard and mouse versus controller to the extent that like things on console are balanced differently.
1855000	1869000	Like Torbjorn's turrets, Symmetra's turrets, don't function the same way on, well they function the same way, they're not as powerful on console because of the whole keyboard and mouse versus, you know, controller thing.
1869000	1875000	So, Blizzard made the very distinct, you can't blame Sony for that one I suppose.
1875000	1883000	Now, I don't know if Blizzard has commented on why Crossplay is not available between PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
1883000	1891000	I think most people have kind of not pushed the issue because we sort of, why would we suddenly expect a game on Sony and Microsoft to be Crossplayable?
1891000	1896000	But now if you throw Nintendo into the mix, that's going to get real interesting. I don't know.
1897000	1908000	Comments and chats over at live.vognetwork.com. Let's see, MegaManX400 says, I honestly believe that Overwatch is coming to Switch.
1908000	1914000	They're just working out the Crossplay with Xbox and they're waiting for the next big character release.
1914000	1923000	Well, my friend, there would be a really good time to announce this coming up in about two months at this little convention that Blizzard likes to hold in Anaheim.
1923000	1927000	So, a little BlizzCon event at the beginning of November is when that is.
1927000	1935000	So, I mean, if it's going to happen anytime soon, that's when they're going to peel back the curtain on it and that would be a big reveal for Overwatch.
1935000	1941000	A lot of people are kind of sitting here going, what is going to be Blizzard's big reveal this year?
1941000	1946000	Usually, most years, every other year at least, it's been a Warcraft expansion.
1946000	1947000	Jetpack cat.
1948000	1953000	But they just had a Warcraft expansion literally last week.
1953000	1959000	So, there's not going to be a new Warcraft expansion announced. They might talk about a new patch. They're not going to talk about a new expansion.
1959000	1965000	So, it's got to be something in the Starcraft universe, the Diablo universe.
1965000	1976000	It could be an Overwatch on Switch. I kind of think it's a reach still, you guys, but I would not say it's impossible. We'll leave it at that.
1976000	1982000	And then what else would be? Hearthstone. Now, see, that's the one that I don't get why that's not on Switch.
1982000	1986000	Hearthstone could easily be on Switch and should be on Switch.
1986000	1993000	Like, that's the one that I don't understand why Nintendo has not put that on Switch. It's on mobile phones, for heaven's sakes.
1993000	1997000	The Switch would let you do a lot more. You'd kind of have the best of both worlds.
1997000	1998000	Yeah, I don't know.
1998000	2002000	Yeah, that's the one that I don't understand why it's not on Switch. We'll see.
2002000	2005000	Well, especially since they have console ports already, so why not?
2005000	2008000	Looking in chat, sj100matt says, yeah, Hearthstone seems like a gimme.
2008000	2014000	BobbyBlackWolf says, Hearthstone should be simple. Open Unity, compile to Switch, profit. Well...
2014000	2016000	You know it's not that easy.
2016000	2018000	You know it's not that easy. Let's turn up the graphics on the screen.
2018000	2019000	But yes, it's almost that easy.
2019000	2024000	It is. No, I totally get what he's saying. I don't want to dismiss that because I would say he's partially right.
2024000	2029000	You know where things are going to get tricky? Online.
2030000	2035000	Hearthstone lives and breathes and dies by the online play and selling the card packs.
2035000	2037000	Because Hearthstone is a free game.
2037000	2043000	So Nintendo needs to be able to support that whole transaction service of the card packs and everything.
2043000	2044000	Well, they have Fortnite.
2044000	2047000	Well, yes, Nintendo has Fortnite. Nintendo does DLC.
2047000	2050000	So, I mean, Nintendo is going to be unveiling this online thing.
2050000	2059000	But, I mean, didn't some of us kind of assume that Nintendo's poor online was what made EA say, never mind.
2059000	2063000	That whole thing we talked about with the Wii U? Never mind.
2063000	2066000	Because we can't nickel and dime people with loot boxes.
2066000	2070000	No, it's because they run everything in fucking Frostbite and Frostbite doesn't run on the Switch.
2070000	2075000	That's why. Because they're fucking lazy with their one-engine franchises.
2076000	2080000	Kaijuto says Hearthstone is gambling so I doubt they want kids to gamble.
2080000	2084000	I'm pretty sure parental controls, which I would hope to God if you're going to drop.
2084000	2087000	Because your kid didn't drop $400 on the Switch, you did.
2087000	2090000	I don't know if you dropped that kind of money on the Switch, you've gone in and set up parental controls.
2090000	2092000	I mean, I don't know because I don't have kids.
2092000	2095000	And, Loki, I don't know if your kids are old enough yet to be doing this.
2095000	2101000	But, like, you know, if you give your oldest kid an iPad, does he know how to go in there and buy stuff?
2101000	2104000	Like, did you have to learn how to go in and shut that off so he needs a password?
2104000	2107000	Or he needs parental controls to be able to do that?
2107000	2111000	Well, I have a password on any of the purchases and there's no way he can...
2111000	2114000	He can't. He won't be able to type it in.
2114000	2121000	Now, with Microsoft, and I think this works on, like, the Xbox too, but with Microsoft you can have family accounts.
2121000	2126000	Basically, you set, like, this person's a child under your account and you can actually allocate them.
2126000	2131000	Okay, you did well today, so I'm going to give you $20 in your account to go spend.
2131000	2137000	And they can go spend it. Or, if they want to purchase something, they go to purchase it and it asks for permission.
2137000	2144000	So, what happens is I get an email saying, Josh wants to purchase Minecraft. Do you accept or decline?
2144000	2145000	You know, and you can do that.
2145000	2147000	Okay. What was that on again?
2147000	2148000	That's on Microsoft.
2148000	2149000	Oh, okay.
2149000	2158000	So, I do that with, like, Windows because when I was setting up his laptop, I had to keep going back and forth between email accounts because, you know, it's all asking permission.
2158000	2165000	I'm like, fine. Yeah, but it's nice because my youngest son, you know, he doesn't understand how purchases work,
2165000	2172000	and so he did go on the Switch and try to purchase skins, or maybe it was a tablet. He tried purchasing skins, but he doesn't have a password.
2172000	2179000	So, he doesn't, it won't let him do it, but he, like, got stuck on a purchase screen and he's like, I don't know what I'm doing.
2179000	2185000	I just wanted to pick that skin because he wanted to be the Power Ranger skin. So, he doesn't know that it costs money.
2185000	2186000	Ah, right, right.
2186000	2189000	But, you know, it didn't let him go that far because I have passwords and everything.
2189000	2190000	Good, good.
2190000	2198000	Whereas back in the day when, like, you know, we were, I don't know about you, Loki, but in my family where I was the kid on the computer all the time,
2198000	2206000	and then it was like if I want to spend the plus hours on Prodigy to use chat rooms or the World Wide Web or something, it was like, oh, it just lets me right on.
2206000	2211000	My parents didn't have to give any permission, and then when the $80 bill comes from Prodigy, I get a scream.
2211000	2212000	Oh, yeah.
2212000	2213000	We did that.
2213000	2215000	Screamed the house down with my mom.
2215000	2221000	Yeah, we did that. We were posting a joke on a joke forum. It was a stupid joke, but for some reason it cost money to do that.
2221000	2225000	Or it was the long distance fees or something like that because there's always long distance fees.
2225000	2226000	Yeah, long distance fees.
2226000	2228000	Connect to a phone number that wasn't local.
2228000	2234000	Yeah, I remember asking permission so I could call the Sierra BBS to download, like, a game demo.
2234000	2238000	Because the Sierra BBS was in the Bay Area somewhere, so it was long distance from here.
2238000	2247000	I remember asking permission. I was like, I got a good grade in school. Can I call the Sierra BBS and spend $10 on a phone call to download some stupid demo?
2247000	2252000	Can I spend $10 in long distance fees to get a free demo?
2252000	2259000	Was it like the local free zine or whatever that would have the BBS numbers in the back?
2259000	2260000	Oh, yeah.
2260000	2265000	So you used to go there and pirate all the things. 56K.
2265000	2266000	Me too.
2266000	2268000	No, I'm sorry. Back then it was 28-8.
2268000	2275000	Do you know how many different BBSes I was playing? Lord of the Red or Legend of the Red Dragon or whatever that game was called?
2275000	2276000	Never got into that.
2276000	2282000	And The Pit. I had the graphical front end for The Pit. I was playing The Pit on like five different BBSes in town. It was crazy.
2282000	2285000	Anyway, alright. We're showing our age here a little bit.
2285000	2290000	Alright, let's get into away from Diablo 3 on the Switch and all that news.
2290000	2297000	Because honestly, we don't know until we know and I think BlizzCon will have some more announcements and we'll just have to wait.
2297000	2302000	Anyhow, in the meantime, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games we have been playing this week.
2302000	2303000	So, Loki, how was your gaming week?
2303000	2306000	My week was just basically Earth Defense Force 4-1.
2306000	2316000	So I went ahead and played it on PC because I've had it on PC for a while and I was researching third person shooter engine type things.
2317000	2322000	That's what I say. But really, what it was is just an excuse to play it through Earth Defense Force 4.1.
2322000	2324000	So I've been doing that and cheating the whole way.
2324000	2328000	But here's the thing though. As the game is so hard, even when I'm cheating, I still die.
2328000	2330000	And it's still incredibly hard while cheating.
2330000	2335000	You would think that I set my life to unlimited, that there's no way I'm gonna die.
2335000	2344000	But no, yet the game finds some fucking way to kill me when there's like literally nothing on the screen to kill me.
2344000	2348000	And I don't know how the hell I died. It's just random like that.
2348000	2353000	So it allows me to see what works for a third person shooter.
2353000	2355000	It makes it fun because Earth Defense Force is fun.
2355000	2363000	But yet Earth Defense Force is also frustrating because of bullshit that it pulls that just doesn't make any sense sometimes.
2363000	2366000	So I'm taking that to note.
2366000	2371000	But yeah, the game, the way it progresses is kind of weird.
2371000	2374000	You know, it goes through the motions of like the first few games where,
2374000	2376000	Oh, you destroyed the mothership and that's that.
2376000	2379000	And then now there's this giant like...
2379000	2384000	And I had to laugh at all of the names that like these scientists or whatever they're supposed to be studying,
2384000	2390000	these Ravager aliens give to these creatures that are attacking them.
2390000	2393000	They like give them the dumbest fucking names possible.
2393000	2397000	Like some of them are just so fucking weird and some of them are just like,
2397000	2400000	We'll call this one an Earth Eater.
2400000	2403000	They're Earth Eaters now or this one is Retarius.
2403000	2407000	Or like, it's like, who the fuck is coming up with these names?
2407000	2409000	Just call them their fucking ants.
2409000	2410000	Call them the giant fucking ants.
2410000	2412000	Hey, there's giant fucking bees now.
2412000	2414000	You don't need to give it like some stupid name.
2414000	2417000	They're fucking giant bees.
2417000	2419000	Not flying insects.
2419000	2421000	Bees is not a copyrighted term.
2421000	2424000	I can't wait to see if you ever make a shoot-em-up game, Loki.
2424000	2425000	You're just going to call the...
2425000	2427000	I will. I will have dialogue like that.
2427000	2431000	We're going to call them ginormous monster.
2431000	2433000	Dude, they're fucking ants.
2433000	2435000	Let's just call them giant fucking ants.
2435000	2436000	Calm down. Calm down.
2436000	2439000	That's literally going to be dialogue if I ever did a game like that.
2439000	2441000	So...
2441000	2445000	But yeah, so it's mainly that and then of course, you know, Pokemon Go.
2445000	2448000	Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme, that usual stuff.
2448000	2450000	Nothing on PlayStation this week.
2450000	2453000	I didn't actually get to mess around on the TV.
2453000	2457000	But yeah, there's Earth Defense Force.
2457000	2459000	Still going to be playing through it some more.
2459000	2461000	My gaming week.
2461000	2463000	I hit level 39 in Pokemon Go today.
2463000	2466000	One more level to go until max level of Pokemon Go.
2466000	2467000	I'm 32.
2467000	2468000	Nice.
2468000	2470000	So here's the thing about hitting level 39.
2470000	2476000	So to get from 0 to 39, you need 15 million XP, cumulative, from start to finish.
2476000	2480000	It takes 5 million XP to get from level 39 to 40.
2480000	2484000	So basically, when you hit level 39, it's congratulations.
2484000	2486000	You're three quarters of the way through the game.
2486000	2489000	So I still have a quarter to go.
2489000	2496000	So as much as it feels like, yay, I got this really high level, it's also like, ah, damn, I still have so far to go.
2496000	2498000	But you know what? Ingress is even worse.
2498000	2500000	It reminds me of that sequence.
2500000	2505000	They have like a montage sequence in South Park where they're grinding in like the beginning area.
2505000	2506000	Yes. Yes.
2506000	2507000	It's basically that.
2508000	2512000	I will say though, the friends system has been like the best thing for XP.
2512000	2517000	Like even though I'm not hitting like three stars with everybody, I'm hitting two stars with a lot of people.
2517000	2519000	Because that takes seven days.
2519000	2523000	I try to cycle. It's really like, I'm sorry if I'm not sending you presents every day on my list.
2523000	2525000	But it is hard to get enough.
2525000	2530000	I try to at least send as much as I can, but like you get capped at opening 20 or 21 gifts.
2530000	2531000	And it's like, I can't.
2531000	2538000	Well, and even that, it's like trying to get the presents from, like I sat, you know, when I'm watching, my kids do gymnastics.
2538000	2542000	And there's a gym there at the gymnastics place.
2542000	2545000	And so I sit there and I'm spinning every five.
2545000	2547000	That's why I keep getting presents.
2547000	2548000	Yes, that's why I keep getting those.
2548000	2552000	I sit there and I spin the stop every five minutes.
2552000	2558000	And I'm lucky to get like three or two or three gifts during like a good hour and a half.
2558000	2560000	So it's ridiculous.
2560000	2563000	But I mean, that whole friend system has been good XP overall.
2563000	2568000	And the ones I have, I have hit three stars with probably, oh, 13 or 14 people.
2568000	2570000	And that's 50K every time.
2570000	2573000	And then maybe two or three of them, I timed it right.
2573000	2575000	Like I actually thought I had to hit the lucky egg.
2575000	2578000	So I got, you know, double XP, which works on those.
2578000	2584000	So like, you know, I got some, that was probably a good million of my XP probably came from all that friend stuff.
2584000	2587000	So I will keep working on that.
2587000	2588000	I'm excited.
2588000	2593000	Anyway, outside of that, been playing more Final Fantasy 14.
2593000	2598000	I finally started the last patch's story, patch 4.3.
2598000	2605000	Because some friends of mine wanted to do Sukiyomi, which is the new raid encounter.
2605000	2607000	Well, I don't know what you call it, eight man battle.
2607000	2610000	They wanted to do that fight on EX or Extreme.
2610000	2612000	And I was like, oh, because I haven't done the story.
2612000	2614000	I haven't even unlocked that fight on regular yet.
2614000	2616000	Whoops, I should probably catch up.
2616000	2618000	So I did finally play through the story.
2618000	2627000	And like this last patch's story is pretty good, even though it's also really like, it's kind of like, well, not kind of, it's really dark.
2627000	2630000	Like it's, wow, it's, it's kind of weird.
2630000	2631000	So, but I liked it.
2631000	2633000	So, because I like sick things.
2633000	2636000	So yeah, that's my Final Fantasy 14 review.
2636000	2638000	It's dark and sick, but I liked it.
2638000	2642000	That was my Final Fantasy 14 experience.
2642000	2645000	And then I've been continuing to play Heroes of the Storm.
2645000	2647000	I've probably done my AI matches every day.
2647000	2653000	I saved up 15,000 in-game gold so I could buy Whitemane, the newest character that they released.
2653000	2655000	Who's a character from World of Warcraft.
2655000	2662000	She's kind of like a bad priest and anybody who's ever run Scarlet Monastery in their World of Warcraft careers knows Whitemane.
2662000	2664000	Cause she's the boss that resurrects her husband.
2664000	2667000	A bad priest? Maybe the timing wasn't great for that one.
2667000	2669000	Loki.
2670000	2676000	But anyway, she's, she's, yeah, so she's, she's a fun character to play though.
2676000	2681000	So yeah, but otherwise, yeah, just been trying to finish my daily quests and all that good stuff.
2681000	2684000	And Heroes of the Storm and a little bit of Overwatch.
2684000	2687000	I didn't realize the consoles and everything were having a free weekend.
2687000	2693000	I was playing on PC and I was like, dang, why am I getting matched with all these like really low level people?
2693000	2695000	And I was, oh, they're having a free weekend on PC.
2695000	2696000	That's what's going on.
2696000	2697000	So they've been having like this long event.
2697000	2700000	But I was just finally like, I haven't played Overwatch in forever.
2700000	2703000	I need to get in there and like play some Moira or something like that.
2703000	2705000	So I did that.
2705000	2706000	It was good.
2706000	2709000	And that was my gaming week pretty much.
2709000	2711000	Not that exciting otherwise.
2711000	2713000	So, all right.
2713000	2714000	Housekeeping.
2714000	2716000	We will not be here in two weeks.
2716000	2720000	Labor Day weekend will not be here as I will be at Dragon Con.
2720000	2723000	I'm going to be a part of eight panels of Dragon Con.
2723000	2725000	So I'll be really easy to find.
2725000	2728000	Hopefully by the time you hear this, the Dragon Con app will be updated.
2728000	2730000	The ETA is on the 20th.
2730000	2733000	And you can find me in the app Rob Roberts under the Attending Professionals.
2733000	2735000	And you can see my schedule there.
2735000	2739000	And I hope to see you at one of the panels that I will be moderating or participating on.
2739000	2740000	Please don't be shy.
2740000	2742000	Come up and say hello and introduce yourself.
2742000	2744000	I always enjoy meeting people from the show.
2744000	2746000	It's always a lot of fun.
2746000	2748000	So, yeah, really looking forward to Dragon Con.
2748000	2750000	Bobby Blackwolf from Voice Geese Network will be there.
2750000	2752000	Other faces.
2752000	2754000	I know Gary from Critical Myth will be there.
2754000	2756000	I think Brian from British Invaders is scheduled to be there.
2756000	2757000	So there will be some other faces.
2757000	2760000	Travis, who used to have Understation Live, is going to be there.
2760000	2763000	He's making his big return to Dragon Con after a couple years off.
2763000	2765000	So really excited to see everybody.
2765000	2766000	Yay.
2766000	2768000	But, yeah, no podcast.
2768000	2772000	As Break Man in chat says, Rob will be way too drunk to podcast.
2772000	2774000	I don't know.
2774000	2777000	Me and getting drunk at Dragon Con is kind of hit and miss.
2777000	2779000	I don't remember getting super drunk last year.
2779000	2782000	Well, wait, I take that back. One night I did.
2782000	2785000	And really, is there too drunk to be podcasting?
2785000	2787000	Because I think it only enhances it.
2787000	2790000	I went to the Spectrum party, which is kind of like the LGBT party.
2790000	2793000	And the only way I could kind of be social was to drink a lot.
2793000	2795000	Because I don't know a lot of people.
2795000	2797000	So, anyway.
2797000	2802000	But since I'm doing so many panels, I don't want to be hungover or drunk on a panel.
2802000	2805000	That's a bad, bad mistake for Rob to make.
2805000	2807000	So I have to be professional.
2807000	2810000	So for that reason, I don't know if I'll be doing a ton of drinking.
2810000	2812000	I don't know. We'll have to see. I have to see what panels I have on Sunday.
2812000	2814000	I think I have maybe only one or two panels on Sunday.
2814000	2815000	So we'll have to see what it is.
2815000	2817000	But I think the Overwatch panel is Sunday.
2817000	2821000	So I kind of need to be in top form for that.
2821000	2823000	So, anyhow.
2823000	2824000	Let's see.
2824000	2827000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2827000	2830000	Tigerclass says, what you don't want to be drunk at is presenting an award.
2830000	2831000	That would be bad.
2831000	2834000	Were we ever drunk when we did the Parsecs?
2834000	2835000	I don't think so.
2835000	2839000	Maybe I'd had one or two drinks, but not enough to be intoxicated.
2839000	2845000	And, please, since I am talking about drinking and glamorizing that, always drink responsibly.
2845000	2850000	Part of the reason why I can do that at Dragon Con is because Dragon Con is all walking.
2850000	2851000	It's all walking distance.
2851000	2853000	And I know plenty of people that are there.
2853000	2855000	So that's why I can be a little bit irresponsible.
2855000	2859000	Because driving at Dragon Con would never come up into the equation.
2859000	2861000	So that is part of the reason why.
2861000	2862000	Okay.
2862000	2866000	Anyhow, let's get into some news.
2866000	2867000	Some gaming news. Loki.
2867000	2878000	Yes. So, Valve, unfortunately, leaked out, I guess, their own, like, Twitch TV competitor.
2878000	2883000	So, they weren't planning on actually putting this live yet.
2883000	2888000	They were testing the stream, I guess, for its Steam.tv.
2888000	2895000	And they had the URL was live for a few hours, basically, while they were working on updating the Steam broadcasting
2895000	2897000	for the main event of The International.
2897000	2901000	And so they are watching, like, a test feed of that.
2901000	2906000	But now that this has kind of come to pass, you know, it's going to be this brand new,
2906000	2911000	looks like almost like a Twitch TV service where they even have, like, the Steam chat integrated into it.
2911000	2915000	And, I mean, maybe it looks just like what you would expect from Twitch.
2915000	2919000	But I don't know if it's going to be anything beyond.
2919000	2923000	I would assume it's going to be something beyond this whole International thing.
2923000	2926000	Okay, correct me if I'm wrong, but Steam has broadcasting built into it already.
2926000	2927000	They do.
2927000	2928000	I've used it.
2928000	2933000	Like, I remember, like, I would just run, like, because Steam Broadcasting couldn't, like,
2933000	2937000	you just leave it open so that friends could watch you at any time.
2937000	2940000	Because I seem to remember when I was online and playing Final Fantasy 13,
2940000	2944000	I just had it open so that people could watch me play if they wanted.
2944000	2946000	But my thing was, when I'm on Steam, I'm not entertaining.
2946000	2950000	I'm just playing the game. I'm not sitting there talking. I'm just doing that.
2950000	2953000	But I think, like, Rage Nader and maybe a couple other people actually, like,
2953000	2956000	would just kind of, like, peek at the game just to see what it looked like.
2956000	2958000	Yeah, and the broadcasts are kind of hidden, though.
2958000	2961000	I mean, you have to go, like, into your community section
2961000	2963000	and then into broadcast to be able to see them.
2963000	2966000	And it's just kind of random stuff.
2966000	2970000	I mean, so it's not really laid out all that well.
2970000	2973000	So maybe this would be kind of a way to...
2973000	2975000	So they're trying to, like, formalize it a little bit.
2975000	2977000	Well, I mean, I don't know.
2977000	2984000	I kind of think at this point it's a little difficult to launch a competitor to Twitch without money.
2984000	2988000	Like, and what I mean is that, you know, part of the reason why I really like being an affiliate on Twitch
2988000	2992000	is that Twitch makes it very clear how I can get money.
2992000	2996000	And, you know, I'm not just in it for the money.
2996000	3002000	But at the same time, you know, if I'm going to have this platform here that says you can make money here
3002000	3004000	and this platform here and this platform here,
3004000	3008000	I'm going to choose the one where maybe I can make five cents when I stream.
3008000	3011000	It's just five cents, but it all adds up. You know what I mean?
3011000	3012000	Right.
3012000	3014000	Like, you can't really make money on Mixer.
3014000	3018000	Well, I mean, you can if you stream for a long time and become a partner.
3018000	3021000	But they have some pretty big requirements for being a partner over on Mixer.
3021000	3026000	From what I remember, at least last time I looked into it, before I hit affiliate on Twitch, there was that thing.
3026000	3029000	So, I mean, is Steam going to give you money in your Steam wallet?
3029000	3032000	Can I tip people from my Steam wallet? Can I give them items?
3032000	3034000	Are they going to do something like that?
3034000	3035000	I don't know.
3035000	3039000	There's really nothing we know about it yet other than it was a thing.
3039000	3043000	Also, I think one other place that Twitch does a really good job is discoverability.
3043000	3046000	That's one other thing I really like about Twitch is the discoverability.
3046000	3052000	Like, I love the community thing, which, you know, it's kind of, you know, I know we talked about that that's going away
3052000	3056000	either last week or the week before, but at least it kind of will have the tags instead
3056000	3058000	and that will kind of accomplish a lot of the same stuff.
3058000	3067000	But here's my thing with this, is that Valve doesn't have enough manpower to run Steam, the marketplace.
3067000	3072000	Do we really want them to be starting a new venture called Steam TV?
3072000	3076000	I mean, like, they can't curate their own fucking marketplace.
3076000	3079000	What makes them think they're going to curate hundreds of streams?
3079000	3081000	I'm with you on that. I'm with you on that.
3081000	3086000	How are they going to moderate? I think that's the first question Steam should have to answer.
3086000	3087000	How are they going to moderate this?
3087000	3092000	Because, like, they can't. They're all algorithms, algorithms. No, it's not working.
3092000	3097000	It's not working at all. There was another story that I heard.
3097000	3101000	There was another crypto miner that was found in another game.
3101000	3106000	You know, it's like, dude, you can't manage your own marketplace.
3106000	3110000	What makes you think you're going to start, like, oh, let's go on some more ventures now?
3110000	3114000	TigerKalonChat says YouTube gaming hasn't really caught on.
3114000	3118000	No, that's a good point. I think a lot of people are getting sick of YouTube shit.
3118000	3126000	Like, unfortunately, on YouTube, YouTube does not care about the content creators as much as it does the copyright people.
3126000	3131000	The copyright people are always right, even when they're not right on YouTube.
3131000	3137000	And I think there's so many people, like, tons of YouTube people that I know have been falsely copyright stricken
3137000	3140000	for something like incidental music that they had the right to use,
3140000	3144000	that the game set on their website was something you can fully monetize on YouTube.
3144000	3149000	And some third-party company that had no right to do it, and YouTube yanks it for that.
3149000	3153000	And I think people are getting fed up with that shit, so people are jumping off YouTube.
3153000	3161000	And so, as far as I'm concerned, YouTube can, you know, sit and spin until they start to side with their creators a little more.
3161000	3165000	YouTube has become too big for its bridges.
3166000	3174000	Well, yeah, I mean, and even just, like, there's also, like, the demonetization or, like, even hiding stuff from feeds.
3174000	3180000	Like, there's, you know, one YouTuber I watch, Philip DeFranco, a lot, he talks about different controversial issues sometimes.
3180000	3186000	Like, he was talking about, you know, the whole thing with the priests, and then also with, um...
3186000	3192000	Oh, God, there's, like, some other, like, incident going on in another country where people were dying or something like that.
3192000	3197000	But he was talking about that, like, in one episode, and they hid it from, like, the feeds from a lot of people.
3197000	3200000	Like, they hid it from the homepage.
3200000	3207000	Even though you may have them as, like, oh, I'm subscribed and I want notifications, they will hide it from your homepage.
3207000	3211000	And you have to actually go into your subscription feeds to find it, which is stupid.
3211000	3216000	And so, that obviously hits them, and so now he's got to change his format.
3216000	3221000	Like, if I have a controversial story, I have to put it in its own separate video, so that one gets dinged.
3221000	3225000	And my main show doesn't get dinged. It's stupid.
3225000	3227000	I'm done with YouTube, personally.
3227000	3233000	Like, maybe if a Nintendo thing, like, has an export to YouTube, I'll just use it because I'm lazy.
3233000	3240000	But for the most part, like, I'm sticking to live stuff on Twitch, and if I want to do pre-recorded stuff,
3240000	3244000	I'm going to just kind of cross my fingers on my toes that Twitch's on-demand presence is going to grow.
3244000	3246000	And I kind of think Amazon is going to push that.
3246000	3251000	Because I know they have a YouTube partner thing for, you know, Nintendo. Do they have that for Twitch, too?
3251000	3252000	No.
3252000	3254000	Do they strike Twitch streams of, like, Nintendo games?
3254000	3261000	No, because Twitch, I don't know if it's that Twitch won't let them, but because Twitch's bread and butter is live,
3261000	3264000	and the rules are a little different when it's live versus on-demand,
3264000	3268000	like, Nintendo doesn't really have that same pull to be able to make those claims.
3268000	3271000	So, it's just, it's kind of, it's just different over there.
3272000	3274000	Win one for Twitch, I guess.
3274000	3277000	Yeah, I really think so. I mean, I don't know if that'll last forever.
3277000	3280000	And you are, you do need to pick what game you're streaming.
3280000	3284000	So, it would be very easy for Twitch to find out what the Nintendo games are.
3284000	3286000	So, if at some point Nintendo wants to swoop in and say,
3286000	3289000	we get a third of all the biddies, I suppose they'll have the right to do that.
3289000	3292000	But, you know, I, here's the thing.
3292000	3295000	I'm okay with that. Like, and I've said this a long time ago.
3295000	3299000	If Nintendo feels that they are entitled to a cut of the profits,
3299000	3302000	I'm okay with that as long as it's fair,
3302000	3306000	as long as it's, you know, not completely cutting out the, you know, person that's,
3306000	3309000	you know, bringing the viewers in, getting their cut too.
3309000	3312000	I'm honestly okay with all that. I just want it to be fair.
3312000	3316000	And what I really want is I don't want videos to get delisted.
3316000	3319000	I don't want videos to get pulled. When somebody is that level,
3319000	3322000	and that could either be affiliate on Twitch or a partner,
3322000	3327000	what do they call it, YouTube content partnership or whatever they call that stuff.
3327000	3330000	They have like the affiliates affiliated.
3330000	3333000	When you get to that level where you agree to go by the rules,
3333000	3337000	then you should be trusted that you're always going by the rules
3337000	3341000	until a person and not a robot verifies that you aren't going by the rules.
3341000	3345000	And then you can, you know, you can have your partnership status stripped away at that time or what have you.
3345000	3348000	What I don't want happening, and this is what really pissed me off at YouTube,
3348000	3353000	is automated computer matching system because then that leaves it to exploitation,
3353000	3355000	which is what's happening with these third-party companies
3355000	3359000	that have no right to be making copyright claims against shit that isn't theirs.
3359000	3363000	That's what finally broke me on YouTube when some fucking, I played, what was it?
3363000	3365000	Was it Cuphead or something I was playing?
3365000	3368000	And some company I'd never fucking heard of in my life
3368000	3370000	go in in there and copyright strike it.
3370000	3372000	And I was like, what?
3372000	3376000	And it wasn't like there's a very clear thing on the developer's website for Cuphead that's like,
3376000	3380000	yes, you can stream and monetize, have fun, do it.
3380000	3384000	And it's like, then this fucking thing copyright striked my channel.
3384000	3388000	And it's like, if I am a YouTube partner, which at the time I was,
3388000	3390000	because they didn't have the more strict rules in place yet,
3390000	3392000	why am I not being trusted?
3392000	3396000	Because there's no verifications, I'm sure, of these people saying that this content is mine.
3396000	3398000	What checks are there to do that?
3398000	3400000	Is another algorithm looking at that?
3400000	3402000	No.
3402000	3404000	Looking in chat, DungeonBuster in chat says,
3404000	3408000	Twitch has a number of monetization options that make it tempting for streamers too.
3408000	3413000	They just rolled out membership packages so you can drop five or more donated subs at once for your favorite streamer.
3413000	3416000	It randomly picks five people to get those subs from the dominator.
3416000	3418000	Oh, that's pretty cool.
3418000	3419000	Let's see.
3419000	3420000	ActDeft in chat says,
3420000	3424000	my podcast is stuck to YouTube, but it's mostly convenience,
3424000	3426000	though we do not simulstream over on Twitch.
3426000	3429000	I want to be very clear when I'm talking negative about YouTube.
3429000	3431000	I'm talking about myself as a content creator.
3431000	3433000	I'll still watch YouTube.
3433000	3434000	There's a lot of stuff I watch on YouTube.
3434000	3435000	Yeah, I watch YouTube all the time.
3435000	3439000	Yeah, and if you choose and YouTube's rules don't bother you,
3439000	3441000	and you choose to do YouTube, more power to you.
3441000	3443000	I support independent broadcasting in all fours.
3443000	3445000	That's going to be very clear.
3445000	3447000	If you're choosing to do YouTube, cool.
3447000	3449000	That's between you and YouTube.
3449000	3451000	Between me and YouTube, I'm done.
3451000	3455000	Well, and the thing with YouTube too is a lot of the creators on there
3455000	3459000	know that they aren't making money from YouTube,
3459000	3464000	so that's where the whole Patreon and outside subscriptions and stuff like that work.
3464000	3466000	Yeah, yeah.
3466000	3469000	Anyway, that was not the tangent I was expecting,
3469000	3474000	but I guess this whole streaming games is just going to get bigger and bigger and bigger, right?
3474000	3477000	Especially as we move on to the next round of consoles
3477000	3480000	and see what kind of stuff is built in, and who knows?
3480000	3483000	That's one of those things that people still expect Nintendo to unveil,
3483000	3485000	is here's how to stream your game live on Twitch.
3485000	3488000	Well, now, we just talked about this whole thing
3488000	3490000	where Nintendo has a partnership on YouTube and not on Twitch.
3490000	3493000	Do you think Nintendo is going to build Twitch streaming into the Switch?
3493000	3496000	I doubt it. Although, Twitch, tWitch is pretty funny.
3496000	3498000	Twitch, tWitch.
3498000	3500000	tWitch, tWitch.
3500000	3502000	Ah, forget it.
3502000	3504000	Hey, let's talk about Halo.
3504000	3506000	Jamie's not here. Let's talk about Halo.
3506000	3508000	Oh, Halo. Naughty.
3508000	3510000	No, even if she was here, we would have to talk about this
3510000	3512000	because this is new and current and relevant news.
3512000	3517000	No, all Halo jokes aside, Halo Infinite is Halo 6.
3517000	3521000	So, instead of another game coming out later called Halo 6...
3521000	3524000	Well, that's alright. Final Fantasy Online was Final Fantasy XI, so you know.
3524000	3526000	Well, but they never really called it that anyway.
3526000	3530000	But Halo Infinite is Halo 6. This is confirmed by 343 Industries.
3530000	3535000	And this was during a Mixer stream where Halo writer Jeff Easterling
3535000	3536000	I hope I said that right, said,
3536000	3539000	It's Halo 6. You should just consider it Halo 6.
3539000	3541000	Don't think of it as a weird prequel kind of thing.
3541000	3544000	It's the next story. It's the next chapter in what's going on.
3544000	3549000	So this is Halo 6, but for whatever reason they're calling it Halo Infinite.
3549000	3553000	And that could be because of the, you know,
3555000	3559000	We're thinking like an always persistent world, kind of like the Destiny games have had.
3559000	3561000	You know, but maybe hopefully a little bit different.
3561000	3564000	Because I kind of feel like we've been there, done that with Destiny.
3564000	3566000	But maybe this is going to be Halo's version of that.
3566000	3569000	But whatever you want to slice it, it is Halo 6.
3569000	3571000	So, that's cool.
3571000	3577000	Other things about Halo is that there's going to be a Halo crossover in Forza Horizon 4, it appears.
3577000	3580000	And this is thanks to yet another leak.
3580000	3586000	There was an image dump on Imgur that showed some images of an early version of the game
3586000	3589000	that showed the Warthog from Halo in the game.
3589000	3591000	I thought that they announced this a while ago.
3591000	3594000	Well, because the Warthog has been in Forza before.
3594000	3595000	Oh.
3595000	3596000	So that's not new.
3596000	3604000	But the Warthog in these pictures is in a beach area where there is a Covenant spaceship in the sky
3604000	3606000	and a Halo ring in the distance.
3606000	3607000	Okay, that's new.
3607000	3609000	That's new. Yeah, exactly. That part's new.
3609000	3615000	So, it looks like there may actually be a themed Halo event on the world map.
3615000	3619000	Because some people kind of saw this icon in like a trailer or something
3619000	3623000	that was on the world map in July in some preview or trailer.
3623000	3625000	So I guess, yeah, some people are data mining.
3625000	3631000	It looks like there's probably going to be a Halo event that involves like a Halo actual themed course.
3631000	3634000	But I think that's kind of rad. I'm open to that.
3634000	3635000	That's pretty cool.
3635000	3639000	If you can do Hot Wheels and all this other stuff that you do, why not?
3639000	3641000	Why not Blizzard? Why not a Blizzard course?
3642000	3643000	I'm sorry.
3643000	3645000	Because I was thinking of the Blizzard mountain.
3645000	3647000	You're also probably thinking of Destiny.
3647000	3648000	I am.
3648000	3651000	But I do mean, of course, Halo in this case.
3651000	3653000	So, Super Halo Kart. Why not?
3653000	3654000	Super Master Chief Kart.
3654000	3655000	Alright.
3655000	3661000	Anyway, speaking of Forza Horizon though, now's your last chance to get Forza Horizon 2.
3661000	3665000	It will be gone from the Xbox store as of September 30th.
3665000	3670000	Turn 10 and Microsoft are removing Forza Horizon 2 on September 30th.
3670000	3675000	It is Xbox Live Gold's game right now of the like free game that you can get.
3675000	3680000	So if you don't have it, you can get the regular edition free until August 31st.
3680000	3686000	But if you want to download the DLC for that, which I think there was like a Stormy Daniels DLC.
3686000	3689000	No, it's Storm Island or something like that was the DLC.
3689000	3692000	I don't know, I'd be kind of interested to see what that other DLC would be, but anyway.
3692000	3699000	And a random thought, because we have those every time I drive by the strip club that we have that's right next to the freeway.
3699000	3700000	Look and see who's on the marquee.
3700000	3701000	Yes.
3701000	3703000	She's coming to the strip club in October.
3703000	3704000	Oh, really? Fun.
3704000	3706000	That should be an OLR night out.
3706000	3708000	That's just a random thought I had.
3708000	3709000	Thank you for that thought.
3709000	3711000	That should be an OLR team building event.
3711000	3712000	Team building.
3712000	3723000	Alright. Anyhow. Why not? Jamie would have fun. We'd have a good time.
3723000	3730000	Alright, anyway. So anyway, they are saying that Forza Horizon 2 is being pulled because the title is End of Life.
3730000	3732000	So it's a, which.
3732000	3736000	Pull those servers. Long live Forza Horizon 4.
3736000	3742000	The servers got pulled a long time ago. So, you know, I think they kind of pulled those halfway through Forza Horizon 3's life cycle.
3742000	3748000	So you know what? I'm going to guess music licenses. Probably a big part of the reason why they are not going to be selling it anymore.
3748000	3755000	They can't stop selling the disc versions though. That's the great thing about, you know, having physical copies on discs.
3755000	3756000	This is true.
3756000	3758000	You can still buy those after the day.
3758000	3759000	Consider that.
3759000	3763000	But don't expect to be able to get DLC or anything else. So be sure to catch up on that.
3763000	3768000	If you have a copy of Forza Horizon 2 sitting around, make sure you've got all your freebies, make sure you've grabbed any DLC you want to get.
3768000	3771000	Get that before September 30th.
3771000	3774000	So yes, we just went from Halo to Forza to more Forza.
3774000	3776000	That was a lot of ground there, Loki. What's next?
3776000	3779000	Rumors and speculation.
3779000	3780000	Yeah, our favorite.
3780000	3782000	People have been staring.
3782000	3791000	Because remember during the last Smash event they had a green logo that was in the bottom that it was all pixelated and you're not supposed to know what it is yet.
3791000	3795000	So people have been staring cross-eyed and trying to figure out what it is.
3795000	3799000	Apparently the bottom of the frame wasn't as pixelated as everything else.
3799000	3805000	And so fans have made out that perhaps it says spirits.
3805000	3810000	And it has something to do with the fact that, you know, why we're seeing all of these characters getting killed.
3812000	3820000	No word exactly on what that's supposed to be, but it'd be interesting since we have seen several characters get killed in the trailer so far.
3820000	3822000	It's alluding to that.
3822000	3823000	Interesting.
3823000	3825000	I don't know what that would be about, but...
3825000	3830000	Alright, well, you know, I'll just chalk it up to another crazy Nintendo fanboy theory.
3830000	3832000	But alright, okay. Go ahead.
3832000	3835000	Next thing you're going to tell me is the Phantom Pains is Metal Gear Solid 5.
3837000	3842000	I don't know what to believe anymore. It's a wholly original game.
3842000	3845000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
3845000	3849000	Act F says, they're getting revived with the Dragon Balls. Goku confirmed.
3849000	3851000	S2 and Hunter Matt says, hmm, seems like a reach.
3851000	3855000	Dark 2 CD says, oh yeah, I forgot Mario got murdered in the Ridley trailer.
3855000	3856000	So there you go.
3856000	3858000	So, some of the comments in chat.
3858000	3862000	I'd be fine with Goku being in the game.
3862000	3868000	There's going to be 5,000 different modes in Super Smash Bros. and it's still not going to be enough for some people.
3868000	3872000	I want my single player mode from Wii. I actually like that quite a bit.
3872000	3875000	Wart didn't make the game, therefore it's trash.
3875000	3881000	And there's still months. Hey, if they haven't announced anything about their online service and that's coming out, there's still time.
3881000	3883000	Oh yeah, there's still time.
3883000	3885000	It's like reverse valve time.
3885000	3893000	There's always time for games to find their fans and get more sales and get a second wind in the game.
3893000	3899000	As Gone Home is about to experience, Gone Home is going to be releasing on the Switch very soon.
3899000	3907000	It was originally released in 2013 for the PC and then it came out on, what, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One like three years later.
3907000	3913000	Gone Home was supposed to arrive on the Wii U, but it never happened. Fancy that. I wonder why.
3913000	3921000	They just decided to cancel it on the Wii U and they moved it over to the Switch and now you can get Gone Home on the Switch starting August 23rd.
3921000	3925000	And there is a part of me, again, I liked Gone Home a lot.
3925000	3932000	I know Gone Home gets a lot of shit because it's not a very action-y type of game. It's very much an interactive story.
3932000	3934000	That's fine.
3934000	3940000	Some people call it a walking simulator to degrade the game. I don't necessarily think that's an insult.
3940000	3948000	Sometimes I like exploring new worlds to learn new stories and things and that was certainly a lot of what Gone Home was.
3949000	3954000	I hope this isn't too spoilery for Gone Home, but the game came out five years ago.
3954000	3959000	I think the whole thing for me with Gone Home is that I was expecting it to be a scary game.
3959000	3967000	So I was playing it the whole time thinking, oh god, I'm going to open one of these doors and the boogeyman is going to come out and rip my head off and it's going to be really explicit and all this stuff.
3967000	3974000	But it never happened and instead the game kind of ended up being this whole other thing that was actually really neat.
3974000	3981000	And that's kind of what I really liked about Gone Home was that you expected one thing, but you got something completely different.
3981000	3989000	I don't know, I kind of like that, but I guess other people are pissed off they didn't get eaten to death by zombies. That's what they were hoping for in Gone Home.
3989000	3996000	Now, are there people that still need to experience this? They don't own PCs?
3996000	3997000	I guess there is...
3997000	3999000	I have yet to play the game.
3999000	4001000	Are you going to check it out on the Switch?
4001000	4003000	I already have it on PC.
4003000	4007000	I just haven't played the game because it's a part of my Steam library.
4007000	4009000	I know, I hear you.
4009000	4012000	I probably have it on Playstation 4 too.
4012000	4014000	It was a plus title at one point.
4014000	4016000	I probably have it.
4016000	4027000	But I guess there is a small portion of Nintendo hardcore fanboys that just don't do a lot of PC gaming that aren't going to play the game if it doesn't come out on their consoles.
4027000	4029000	So I guess it's going to be good news to some people.
4029000	4037000	I'm not bagging on the game. I'm just kind of like, wow, who's left that wants to play this game that hasn't by now?
4037000	4039000	Because it has been so cheap on Steam.
4039000	4041000	And it has been a giveaway on these other consoles.
4041000	4047000	But I guess even a small subset of people, if it sells a few more copies, is going to be worth it.
4047000	4054000	And I imagine, kind of like Bobby was joking earlier, but is maybe not too terribly far from the truth.
4054000	4058000	And it's already in Unity and was published on Playstation 4 and Xbox One.
4058000	4060000	Click the export into the Switch button.
4060000	4066000	Obviously some of the button for the rules of the system and stuff have to be changed.
4066000	4068000	Yeah, there's more work than just that.
4068000	4070000	I know, but it's not like they're having to redo the whole game.
4070000	4072000	Right, that's true.
4072000	4074000	But I don't know.
4074000	4076000	I think what we really need.
4076000	4080000	Gone Home, I'm glad that there are more indie games that are coming to the Switch.
4080000	4084000	I just wish their marketplace was usable.
4084000	4088000	Yeah, the Nintendo market is getting pretty garbage.
4088000	4094000	And it does not lend itself well to discoverability of things that aren't new, if you don't know it's there.
4094000	4098000	Or at least Nintendo kind of needs a better online shop.
4098000	4102000	Like where you can buy stuff on the web and have it queued up to your Nintendo Switch.
4102000	4104000	Which you can do.
4104000	4109000	But the online version of the store is not terribly different from what you get on the Switch itself.
4109000	4114000	So it would be kind of neat if that was a little snappier and worked a little faster and had some better discoverability in it.
4114000	4116000	So, listen.
4116000	4120000	Dr. Suya in chat says, I do have it, Gone Home, on PC.
4120000	4123000	I'll probably check it out at some point when my new computer is back up.
4123000	4129000	You should. I mean, Gone Home will only take you, like, and maybe this is the other reason why people had a problem with it.
4129000	4131000	It's only like a two to three hour game.
4131000	4133000	Like it's like watching a long movie, basically.
4133000	4136000	It's not a terribly long game.
4136000	4142000	So, I mean, maybe if you really get stuck or confused and can't figure out where to go.
4142000	4146000	But mostly by retracing your steps and like, have I been through this door?
4146000	4148000	You'll figure it out. I don't think you're going to have lost too long.
4148000	4150000	Was it like, Firewatch is coming to the Switch too.
4150000	4152000	So I mean, it's like all of the Unity games.
4152000	4155000	So all of those quote unquote walking simulator games.
4155000	4157000	But they're all really good.
4157000	4159000	Honestly, like, this is going to be.
4159000	4162000	So, okay, so I think here's the genre to me.
4162000	4168000	Edith Finch, Gone Home, Firewatch, and Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.
4168000	4171000	Out of those games, honestly, Firewatch is probably my least favorite of the four.
4171000	4174000	And that's not to say it's bad by any means.
4174000	4178000	I just wasn't thrilled with how the story kind of resolved at the end.
4178000	4180000	So they're like puzzle games?
4180000	4184000	Is it more like, you know, like Myst or something like that where you're like solving puzzles?
4184000	4186000	Or is it more of just kind of a story?
4186000	4188000	It depends on the game.
4188000	4192000	Like, I think there was a puzzle or two in Gone Home.
4192000	4194000	But it's nothing you can't figure out pretty quickly.
4194000	4198000	Because there was a game I liked except for the fact that the save system corrupted.
4198000	4200000	And it was all fucked up in that sense.
4200000	4203000	But there was a game called Ether One that was pretty interesting.
4203000	4207000	Where you're kind of like diving into people's memories or something like that.
4207000	4210000	And there was like a whole puzzle.
4210000	4212000	I mean, it's a puzzle game. It's a first person puzzle game.
4212000	4214000	But it was really good.
4214000	4218000	Just its own engine killed itself.
4218000	4221000	I mean, so that was the problem I ran into.
4221000	4226000	But here's the interesting thing. Out of all of those games, my absolute favorite is Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.
4226000	4229000	And in that one, there is absolutely no puzzles.
4229000	4232000	It's just exploration.
4232000	4236000	And learning different parts of the story that unfold as you explore new areas.
4236000	4240000	And find these new places to go and look around.
4240000	4244000	Because again, the whole thing about Everybody's Gone to the Rapture is that nobody's there.
4244000	4248000	So it's like you're going through this town revealing its memories.
4248000	4252000	You're going through people's shit when they're not there to learn more about them.
4252000	4256000	And it's really interesting. To me, it was just a really interesting way to tell a story.
4256000	4260000	And I loved the story in that game. The ending wrecked me. It's great.
4260000	4264000	But you know what? I know people that fucking hate that game.
4264000	4270000	It's truly different folks like different types of games.
4270000	4272000	It's just like movies.
4272000	4274000	Oh yeah, you're right. It's just like movies.
4274000	4276000	Every movie that comes out is an action movie.
4276000	4282000	And for me, a lot of the big bang explosion action movies, I'm like, who cares?
4282000	4286000	Although, I can be honest. If I'm going to go see a movie like Transformers,
4286000	4292000	I'm not going to expect anything but, or better yet, Independence Day.
4292000	4296000	You know exactly what you're going to get when you go see a movie like Independence Day, right?
4296000	4301000	It's just, what's that guy, Roland Emmerich? All his movies are blow shit up.
4301000	4305000	You know when you go see something, you're going to see something get blown the fuck up.
4305000	4307000	You know it's going to be stupid.
4307000	4309000	It's going to be stupid.
4309000	4314000	But if you go in expecting anything different, then that's kind of your own fault.
4314000	4318000	And that's exactly how I reviewed the Mamma Mia sequel last week.
4318000	4325000	If you go in there expecting anything different than, you know, a bunch of older men and women
4325000	4329000	dancing around to ABBA songs and Cher shows up and steals the whole fucking thing.
4329000	4333000	Like if somehow you're expecting anything less than what you're going to get when I describe it as that.
4333000	4335000	There's no Italians in this at all.
4341000	4342000	Anyway.
4342000	4347000	Let's see. I'm looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
4347000	4351000	Bonds006 says, so Gone Home is how to commit B and E, breaking and entering.
4351000	4354000	Well, that's kind of how the game starts.
4354000	4356000	Except it is your parents' house.
4356000	4359000	So is it really breaking and entering?
4359000	4360000	I don't know.
4360000	4363000	Let's see. I'm going to chat at live.vognetwork.com.
4363000	4367000	Some folks are talking about The Meg. Tigerfly says, you see The Meg. It's a fun movie.
4367000	4368000	Is that the, like...
4368000	4369000	The giant shark one.
4369000	4372000	What is that? Is it Shark Week?
4372000	4374000	Because we got that, we got Sharknado. Was Sharknado tonight?
4374000	4378000	They had a final Sharknado, which like is time travel and stuff like that.
4378000	4381000	All I heard was that Alaska Thunderfuck is in that movie, and that makes me...
4381000	4383000	That's a drag queen from RuPaul's Drag Race.
4383000	4385000	So, I mean...
4385000	4387000	I don't know what she plays, but I'm sure it's great.
4387000	4389000	I love that Sharknado is basically...
4389000	4394000	Like, Sharknado is a ridiculous thing to begin with, and then there's like...
4394000	4397000	We're embracing this camp. We're just going full camp.
4397000	4399000	Turn the camp to 11.
4399000	4405000	The thing about Alaska Thunderfuck is that she talks a certain way.
4405000	4411000	And she's very overacting in the way that she delivers her lines.
4411000	4417000	When she's talking and on stage and presenting, it kind of sounds like this.
4417000	4421000	So I'm just thinking, like, in the movie, it's going to be like, what?
4421000	4422000	It's going to be amazing.
4422000	4427000	I've never seen any of the Sharknado movies, but I know people that, like, obsess.
4427000	4434000	Because it's going to be garbage, but you know what kind of garbage it is going into it.
4434000	4436000	Yeah, it's true. That's true.
4436000	4438000	All right. Anyhow...
4438000	4440000	It's like Earth Defense Force.
4440000	4446000	You know that the construction of the game is garbage, but you know what you're expecting,
4446000	4449000	and that's what you go in there expecting is exactly what you get.
4449000	4453000	All right, we've got a couple more stories, then we're going to get to the classic game of the week. Loki.
4453000	4466000	All right, so apparently there has been a court case that has blocked the sale of some online cheating tools for Grand Theft Auto Online from being sold.
4466000	4468000	So that's good, I guess.
4468000	4482000	So apparently, yeah, the U.S. District Court of Southern District, New York, they issued a preliminary injunction against a guy that was selling cheating software for Grand Theft Auto 5.
4483000	4491000	And apparently this is an ongoing lawsuit between Take-Two Interactive and David Zipper.
4491000	4493000	That's his name, Zipper.
4495000	4503000	Because the company claims he has threatened irreparable harm to its game and business by creating cheating programs online.
4503000	4509000	Well, yes, of course, because this is their cash cow. They make so much fucking money from Grand Theft Auto Online.
4509000	4512000	Of course they're going to come after him. Of course.
4513000	4519000	This is so interesting in this day and age, because I've heard of World of Warcraft going for people like this.
4519000	4524000	I've heard of, I think, some other online shooty-shoot games that sue the people that make these cheats and stuff.
4524000	4533000	This very interesting side effect of gaming today is that back in the day when things were single-player experiences,
4533000	4536000	people made cheats and it was whatever, whatever, because it was single-player.
4536000	4544000	But now that real money is involved, multiple people are involved, yeah, game companies are really not having it with these robots.
4544000	4551000	Yeah, because they're making tons of money, and basically this mod would give you the abilities to give yourself money.
4551000	4557000	And that takes money from Take-Two, and they're not going to have any of it.
4558000	4566000	But, yeah, he had a program called Menu, and basically it was sold for $10.
4566000	4574000	And it was a mod for Grand Theft Auto 5 that let players use money-making exploits while playing the game's online portion.
4574000	4583000	And then also you'd be able to do other things to make yourself, you know, invulnerable and whatnot.
4583000	4591000	And then I guess he also broke off, I guess, and started selling a second program called Absolut, which was $20 to $40.
4591000	4593000	Like the vodka?
4595000	4596000	Sort of.
4596000	4597000	Okay.
4597000	4601000	But, yeah, so basically he's in a whole lot of trouble.
4601000	4607000	Alright, well, think twice before you make a cheat program that's going to mess with an online thing,
4607000	4613000	because the developers of the game may not be happy with you, especially if they're making a lot of money off that online thing.
4613000	4619000	They're making tons of stuff. I mean, they're doing lots of free content, but all of that content costs in-game money, so, you know.
4619000	4627000	So, we've heard a lot about the ROM sites out there getting shut down because of, you know, Nintendo, you know,
4627000	4632000	kind of wanting to protect, you know, their intellectual properties and all this stuff.
4632000	4634000	We got into that a little bit last week.
4634000	4636000	It's going to be interesting to see what Nintendo thinks of this.
4636000	4640000	It is a new, like, device. It's not Nintendo's device, obviously.
4640000	4642000	This is something else coming out.
4642000	4644000	The Classic 2 Magic.
4644000	4651000	It is an attachment for the Super Nintendo Classic Mini that will allow you to add more games to Nintendo's little hardware.
4651000	4656000	What it is, but it's not like a hack your Super Nintendo Classic.
4656000	4662000	It's an actual little device that you plug into it that you then can plug cartridges into.
4662000	4664000	So you use real cartridges.
4664000	4665000	It's still hacking the device.
4665000	4669000	And then it powers, basically, your device, yeah, by basically hacking into it.
4669000	4674000	But, anyway, you can back up the ROMs, wink, and copy the ROMs, wink,
4674000	4678000	thanks to the inclusion of a USB drive that is also available with this thing.
4678000	4681000	They are also doing one for the NES Classic Mini.
4681000	4688000	It's going to be, what, $59.95, I think, if this is coming out, if Nintendo doesn't try to shut this down.
4688000	4693000	But I don't know if Nintendo would shut this down because, A, I have to be honest,
4693000	4698000	$59.95 seems a little steep for me for this because can't you just get a Retron for that price?
4698000	4707000	Or one of the other many knockoff hardware things that will play, like, just instantly dump the games and play them on the TV?
4707000	4710000	Like, don't Retron consoles only cost, like, 50 bucks at this point?
4710000	4714000	Or I'll just go with one of the many other ROM sites out there and just download the fucking game.
4714000	4719000	I'm like, if I have a physical copy of the cartridge, I'm not paying $60 to dump my own ROM,
4719000	4721000	to play the same ROM that I can download online.
4721000	4723000	Fuck it. You know what? Just, who cares?
4723000	4727000	And Brad from PodCulture in our chat points out it still hacks. It alters the firmware.
4727000	4732000	Um, yeah, it does. It has to. That's the only way it's going to be able to work.
4732000	4736000	Oh, whoops! We left this functionality in. Dope.
4736000	4739000	It'll be interesting to see if Nintendo has anything to say about that.
4739000	4741000	And Brad from PodCulture says, not the Retron 5.
4741000	4745000	What about the Retron, don't they just call it Retron HD?
4745000	4749000	And I think it's the one that only does, because Retron 5 does, like, Game Boy and everything.
4749000	4752000	But isn't there, like, a Retron that only does, like, Nintendo and Super Nintendo?
4752000	4755000	Maybe Sega Genesis as well, like, a Retron 3?
4755000	4759000	I feel like, there's all these different configurations out there.
4759000	4761000	They, like, they sell the Retron at Fry's Electronics now.
4761000	4766000	Yeah, that's all public domain now, I think, the copyrights for this.
4766000	4771000	Yeah, I think the hardware copyrights expire after, what, like, 25 years, is it?
4771000	4772000	Yeah, something like that.
4772000	4777000	So, wouldn't PlayStation 1's copyrights come up, like, 2019?
4777000	4780000	Are we gonna start to see knock-off PlayStation?
4780000	4783000	I think that's gonna be interesting, that they'll have, they're gonna,
4783000	4788000	Yeah, they're gonna sell, like, PlayStations that you can hook up via HDMI,
4788000	4792000	before the actual PlayStation 4 will play those games.
4794000	4798000	Do you think that might pressure Sony to do backwards compatibility, at least for PS1 games?
4798000	4803000	If the patents, and again, I am no expert on patent law,
4803000	4808000	but my understanding is, the reason why these Retrons and things are allowed to exist,
4808000	4813000	and Nintendo cannot come after them, is because the NES, and the Super NES, and the Genesis,
4813000	4818000	and all these systems that it's, I mean, they've been out for so long, that the technology patents are up.
4818000	4823000	It's great, like, I went over to our local record used store, Dimple, or whatever,
4823000	4828000	so they have, like, if you want to get into all that retro stuff, they have retro everything,
4828000	4833000	like game controllers, like, oh hey, I want a Nintendo 64, well here's everything you need,
4833000	4836000	you know what I mean, and even the games, it's fantastic.
4836000	4840000	Yeah. So, hmm, I'm very curious to see what happens, yeah, if it's,
4840000	4846000	because PlayStation 1 was 1994 or 1985, might not be till 2020.
4846000	4848000	I didn't get mine until 97, so I don't know.
4848000	4851000	I got mine when Final Fantasy VII came out.
4851000	4855000	I want to say I remember a friend talking about playing Mortal Kombat on PlayStation,
4855000	4857000	when I was a senior in high school, which was in 95, 96.
4857000	4862000	I suppose, if only I had this vast information source in front of me, called the internet,
4862000	4869000	I suppose that I could find out using said internet, maybe if there was an engine to search in.
4870000	4874000	Do you think there might be a Wikipedia article that would just have it right there in the sidebar?
4874000	4877000	Yeah, I mean, probably, yeah.
4877000	4880000	Well, now with PlayStation, because it's like, I don't know, which PlayStation are you talking about?
4880000	4883000	Which PlayStation do you mean, the PlayStation Family, or the PlayStation?
4883000	4885000	Uh, 94, December 3rd.
4885000	4894000	Okay, so then that means December of 2019, if, I mean, I don't know, but see, I'm no expert on this.
4894000	4897000	I don't want to get, like, Rob, you said this, I don't know how this all exactly works,
4897000	4904000	because for some things, like, Disney still manages to protect Mickey Mouse, like, all these years later.
4904000	4906000	That's trademarks, yeah.
4906000	4908000	Oh, okay, trademarks are trademarks.
4908000	4910000	Oh, okay, I get it now.
4910000	4911000	So they could, they, yeah.
4911000	4914000	But they keep extending it, like, every time Mickey Mouse-
4914000	4915000	Because they're assholes.
4915000	4921000	Yeah, I know, Disney lobbies Washington to extend that stuff, because, but at the same time,
4921000	4926000	can you imagine what would happen if Mickey Mouse suddenly became public domain?
4926000	4929000	Have you seen his normal cartoons now?
4929000	4935000	It's like fucking, like, Ren and Stimpy or SpongeBob, it's like, fuck, like, what the fuck happened to Mickey Mouse?
4935000	4937000	I'm just thinking about all the pornos people are going to make with Mickey Mouse.
4937000	4940000	Oh, yeah, they'll start then.
4940000	4943000	Or cell phone games starring Mickey Mouse. Anyway.
4943000	4945000	Oh, yeah, like, that's going to hold them back.
4945000	4949000	It's not going to happen anyway, because it got extended so far.
4949000	4955000	No, like, seriously, my kids watch, you know, the Mickey Mouse, like, cartoons on the YouTube Kids app and stuff.
4955000	4956000	Oh.
4956000	4958000	And it is fucking obnoxious now.
4958000	4963000	Like, I mean, like, the old cartoons are kind of weird and stuff, but, like, they're fucked up looking.
4963000	4966000	Like, it's like crystal meth Mickey Mouse is what it is.
4966000	4976000	Does the old Mickey Mouse stuff get into that really, like, yucky, like, borderline, well, not even borderline, just, like, flat out racist stuff that some of the old cartoons got into?
4976000	4981000	Because some of these cartoons were made during World War II and stuff when people were really fucking racist.
4981000	4989000	I don't know about that, but, like, the new Mickey Mouse cartoon that they have now, because they tried to revamp it, just like they did with DuckTales, except DuckTales doesn't suck.
4989000	4991000	It's actually pretty good.
4991000	4998000	The new Mickey Mouse cartoon, it's like, it's seriously, like, crystal meth Mickey. It's just weird shit.
4998000	5007000	Well, obviously, anything new is gonna take, but, I mean, like, I know when they've released, like, the Warner Brothers collection, like, they have a big old disclaimer that's like,
5007000	5019000	Hey, you know, this, and I'm not gonna say it word for word, but it's only, like, hey, this is a product of a different time, so the views expressed here do not express the way that we think now,
5019000	5026000	but to suppress this stuff would be to hide that this stuff exists, you know, and we have to learn from the mistakes that we've made in the past.
5026000	5034000	Just something like that. The Warner Brothers has a pretty tactful little disclaimer on their thing, you know, so I'm just, I'm, you know, I know they made a lot of, like, cartoons that you go back and watch now.
5034000	5047000	Like, some of, like, the Popeye cartoons and stuff from back in the day are like, dang, like, this is, you know, but it was very much a product of a different era, you know, when racism was everywhere in part because we were at war with other countries, you know?
5047000	5059000	You know, anyway, just interesting. Anyway, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Tigerclaw says, did you hear Donald's new voice?
5059000	5066000	Yes, yes, I, yes, I did see that, where Don Cheadle was doing the voice of it. I did watch that clip, yeah.
5066000	5081000	sjo100matt kind of pointing out that Song of the South is still banned. That's still a thing that Disney, at least in the US, I believe in other countries, Disney has, like, kind of obscurely released, you know, for collectors that need to have everything.
5081000	5097000	But it's interesting because that movie is banned, but yet Splash Mountain is still such a big ride at Disneyland, which, like, the song Zippidy-Doo-Dah comes from that movie, so it's interesting.
5097000	5099000	The kids don't know that, though.
5099000	5101000	No, kids don't know that. They don't.
5102000	5122000	So, interesting. And bonds006 kind of also reinforcing about the disclaimer there. They do state that the contents can be offensive. Yeah, I mean, in the lens of our society today, they are very offensive, but, you know, we have to learn from the mistakes of the past, or we're doomed to repeat it, I suppose.
5123000	5145000	Alright, anyhow, let's talk about, before we get to the Classic Game of the Week, I also want to talk about SNES Party. So, speaking of other things that Nintendo may or may not shut down, apparently there's a new emulator called SNES Party, and it's being branded as an experimental way to play SNES games with your friends online, all within your browser, using WebRTC. Well, this is gonna go well.
5146000	5148000	I see no faults with this.
5148000	5163000	Yeah, so before Monday, and the law office is open, you might want to head over to SNES.party if you want to check this out, because it's just, you know, again, the law office is open Monday morning, and this will probably be gone by then.
5164000	5177000	But if you want to check that out, you can. I haven't checked this out, but apparently people play online, and it works pretty well. I did not think online play in emulators was anything new. I seem to remember SNES9X had online.
5178000	5187000	I did not think online play in it a long time ago, so it was kind of, you know, because the internet wasn't as fast then, it wasn't as good. It's probably better now, but yeah.
5188000	5200000	If you want to check that out, you can. Enjoy it before it's gone. Alright, but I think while we're enjoying some Super Nintendo classics, maybe we ought to enjoy some other classic games of the week.
5201000	5213000	And thanks to what we know as, is Bobby Black Wolf out there, Radio Magic. We are joined by the one and only Dark Sakura for the classic game of the week. Hi.
5214000	5222000	Hi. It's so, you're here. I am. It's like I'm actually here or something. It's like you never left us in the first place.
5223000	5229000	I'm working stuff out to make it at least to some damn life. Alright, no, it's all good. I gotta pay my bills. Alright.
5230000	5238000	Well, we gotta educate the children on a classic game of the week, and I think this is one I bet very few have played. It is actually one of the first MMOs.
5239000	5246000	But this is important. I think this is an important cornerstone of gaming history. What is the classic game of the week?
5247000	5252000	The classic game of the week is Gemstone and all of its iterations that have existed, all four of them.
5253000	5257000	And there's no background music this week. No, because it was a text game. It was a mud. It was a mud.
5258000	5267000	Basically, and if you don't know what a mud, it's a multi-user dungeon or multi-user dimension as some places called it. But this is what we had in the day.
5268000	5272000	We were playing World of Warcraft in DOS. That was a mud.
5273000	5283000	You throw shit at Orgrim Doomhammer. Doomhammer punches you into oblivion. Now you're in another game.
5284000	5287000	Jaina cries and casts ice spells wildly.
5287000	5298000	Yeah. Anyway, Gemstone 4 was the last one, but basically the whole game is sort of a high fantasy in a world called Alanthea.
5299000	5309000	There were a bunch of different versions of it. The original Gemstone was actually nothing but a demo for Genie, as in capital G, capital E, N-I-E.
5310000	5315000	So not like Robin Williams playing the Genie in Aladdin. It's Genie!
5315000	5323000	Genie was General Electric Network for Information Exchange, which was an old online service that was like, I think it peaked in 94.
5324000	5326000	It was like AOL or CompuServe, but worse.
5327000	5330000	Or as we called Compusuck back in the day. And Buttigy.
5331000	5332000	Hey, I loved Prodigy.
5333000	5334000	I know, but we called it Buttigy.
5335000	5336000	We've gotten into this argument before.
5337000	5338000	We were the AOL crowd.
5339000	5340000	Yeah, I know. AOL's where all the lame-o's were at. Lame-o-L.
5341000	5342000	Hey, I met my husband there.
5343000	5344000	Wow.
5345000	5348000	Okay, well keep in mind, I was on AOL like in AOL 2.5 that ran in DOS.
5349000	5351000	Was that the version that came on every CD-ROM for free?
5352000	5353000	No, that was AOL 3.
5354000	5355000	Oh, okay.
5356000	5362000	Anyway, the first playable version was called Gemstone 2, but it was like a closed bracket and an open bracket, so it looked kind of like a weird Roman numeral thing.
5363000	5373000	And it came out in 1988 on Genie, and it was seriously one of the first MMORPGs, and it is one of the longest running online games still active.
5373000	5374000	Wow.
5375000	5376000	Yes, Gemstone is still around.
5377000	5382000	So guess what I'll be livestreaming after the show tonight. No, I'm just kidding.
5383000	5384000	That would be fun, though.
5385000	5386000	The interface actually looks pretty interesting now, but I'll go into that.
5387000	5395000	It has always been subscription-based through the website or different ways, but you also have different subscription levels like Premium, Platinum, and Shattered.
5396000	5399000	And then there is a free-to-play model that started in March 2015.
5399000	5409000	So as far as the current iteration of it, it is built on the Symmetronics engine, the IFE, which means Interactive Fiction Engine.
5410000	5416000	And it's capable of changing nearly any aspect of the game on the fly, which allows updates with no downtime.
5417000	5423000	Imagine if you were in WoW and it just patched while you were playing. Could you imagine that? No, because WoW never works.
5423000	5429000	Well, actually, it does like to download stuff in the launcher. To be fair, Dark Saga, the launcher kind of does that.
5430000	5439000	Yeah, yeah. Anyway, so it means that the game is rarely offline. It has a full 24-hour uptime cycle with the occasional crash, and crashes are rare.
5440000	5444000	So it is nothing but a text medium. It can be played with a Telnet interface.
5445000	5451000	Can you imagine being the engineer assigned to make sure that Gemstone is up and running and just sitting there?
5451000	5458000	Yeah, I've been running the same online game for 30 years. We haven't changed a goddamn thing.
5459000	5461000	Well, they have changed things. That's what I'm going to get into.
5462000	5477000	So basically, the oldest interface for Windows was called the Wizard Front End. But since then, it actually was superseded by the Storm Front in 2003, which basically lets you point-and-click on text in the item to see what your available responses are.
5477000	5479000	You got a big storm coming.
5480000	5488000	So you click on Big Storm Coming, and you get options Run Like Fuck, Dig a Hole, Cry, or Shit Your Pants.
5489000	5493000	Oh, but I've played the game called Don't Shit Your Pants. When does that become eligible for Classic Game of the Week?
5494000	5495000	Eventually.
5496000	5497000	You will make it Classic Game of the Week, right?
5498000	5499000	One day.
5500000	5505000	We have to make sure this show goes another seven or eight years, just so that we can ensure the very last Classic Game of the Week we ever do is Don't Shit Your Pants.
5505000	5506000	Yeah.
5507000	5520000	So anyway, there's a Java one that has a browser called escape. There is still the Wizard one that exists for Mac Classic, and a front end called Avalon for Mac OS X.
5521000	5528000	There are no Linux clients, because no one likes Linux people, apparently, and Linux people have to run wine to be able to play these things in other versions.
5528000	5538000	So basically, Gemstone, the original Gemstone, the one that was a demo, was demonstrated in 1987, and then it was, like I said, only a model.
5539000	5543000	And then in April 1988, Gemstone 2 became available to G&E customers.
5544000	5549000	It was short lived. Gemstone 3 came out into beta testing in 1989, and launched in 1990.
5549000	5558000	Now here's the fun part. I played the fuck out of Gemstone 3 on AOL in 1995.
5559000	5561000	Yes. Is old.
5562000	5574000	And so it really just maintained some significant parts of it, but not all of it, and the character records were not brought over in the transition, so everyone had to start over.
5574000	5582000	Gemstone 3 evolved into Gemstone 4 November 2003, but all of the game world and character records were the same.
5583000	5593000	And it was supposed to promise, Gemstone 3 was, that players could receive real life versions of the gems played in game.
5594000	5602000	It originally was operated with a license to use Rollmaster game mechanics and the Shadow World environment from Iron Crown Enterprises.
5603000	5610000	Then again, they let it also expire in 1995, and removed all the ice intellectual property from Gemstone.
5611000	5618000	So a lot of stuff was really changed, like the name of the world was originally Colthea, and it went to Alanthea, and then they renamed their deities.
5618000	5630000	Basically they called it de-icing. So I wish we could de-ice the real world. Gemstone became available on AOL in September 1995, which was when I was in my second year of college.
5633000	5636000	And when some of our listeners were not born.
5637000	5644000	Shut up. But that was after the de-icing. It had already been on CompuSuck and Buttigy before that. Sorry, CompuServe and Prodigy.
5645000	5656000	When AOL went to flat rate pricing, Gemstone actually went to 1.4 million customer hours in a single month.
5657000	5662000	Going between 2,000 to 2,500 simultaneous players. Could you imagine?
5663000	5668000	So that was like when the plus pricing for bonus stuff was no longer around. It was just part of your monthly fee or whatever.
5669000	5674000	I had a free account though during those days because I was a chat host for Cartoon Network.
5675000	5676000	Oh, that's so random.
5677000	5678000	Did you know that?
5679000	5684000	Now that you said it, yeah, I remember you telling stories about it. It's not one of those things. This is my friend Jamie, and she was the moderator for Cartoon Network in 1995.
5685000	5686000	On AOL.
5687000	5694000	Back in the day, because this was right when they announced, when we were picking our names, I found out ahead of time that Cartoon Network was getting Voltron.
5695000	5705000	So I was like, I want CNW Allura for my name, because you pick a character. So I got Allura and my friend, who is still on buddies with on Facebook, was CNW Keith.
5706000	5709000	So we used to just give each other crap the whole time in chat. It was pretty funny.
5710000	5721000	Anyway, back to this. Gemstone was really well received. For being a surprisingly empty game environment, it got a lot of people involved in there.
5721000	5729000	But as I said, as it went down, it became a much more rewarding experience with built-in commands, so you didn't have to guess.
5730000	5737000	And other types of character ability, you could eventually evolve characters to have different abilities and traits. It was really awesome.
5738000	5741000	In 1997, it actually called it one of the top ten online game picks.
5742000	5752000	And at the time, the game was getting over 50,000 hours of use a month. And it was the 1998 finalist for online game of the year.
5753000	5756000	And in 1996, it was AOL Member's Choice Awards.
5757000	5768000	So Gemstone Foreshadowed came out in May 2010. And it was released with an unrestricted PVP combat system and no policy against automated play.
5768000	5778000	And that brings us up to date with Gemstone that is still running. And honestly, I hope it never goes away, because fuck, we need a mud every so often.
5779000	5780000	And that's it.
5781000	5786000	That's it! So you're encouraging our listeners this week to get out there and play in the mud.
5787000	5788000	And read.
5789000	5790000	Reading is what?
5791000	5792000	Fundamental.
5793000	5794000	And now the library is closed.
5795000	5799000	Anything else you need to tell the folks out there listening before we head off for this week?
5800000	5802000	If things work out, I may still stop by.
5803000	5805000	Okay. Oh, so you may show up later in the show anyway.
5806000	5808000	Yeah, because I actually do have Sunday off, but it's my sister event.
5809000	5810000	Right.
5811000	5812000	So if everything works out, I may still be able to come by.
5813000	5814000	She's so unpredictable!
5815000	5818000	Well, I told you earlier things.
5819000	5820000	Alright, let's get back to the show.
5820000	5825000	But we have, we have leis and oreos to eat.
5826000	5832000	We do. Alright, well, but we got to magically go back to the present and do the show.
5833000	5836000	Whereas in the past, we're getting, you know, hefty and snacking away.
5837000	5838000	Alright, bye.
5843000	5846000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5847000	5849000	A big thank you to Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.
5850000	5859000	Isn't that interesting that, man, Radio Magic works so fast because I just got this text like in the seconds while that little thing was playing from Dark Sakura that says,
5860000	5865000	I'm not making it to the rest of the show. I'm tired and overwhelmed. I'm going to shower and face a rosé.
5866000	5873000	She had some good, I think, I think I'm okay to share this with you guys because she talks a lot about her sisters of perpetual indulgence and the stuff she's going through.
5874000	5877000	So tonight they elevated her to like, she's a full on sister now.
5877000	5883000	So be like, she, she made the frat. She's been rushing the frat this whole time she made the frat and they made her a sister tonight.
5884000	5886000	So that's really exciting for her. So that's awesome. Yeah, no, it is awesome.
5887000	5894000	So, um, yeah, so, so that's why she's a very exhausted, but I knew, see, and you might be like, isn't she missing the show cause of work?
5895000	5900000	Yes, but tonight would have been a night that she was going to be preplanned out anyway because of this other stuff.
5900000	5909000	So anyway, she has a very busy life and she will make time for you where possible and we'll make time for some rapid fire news right now. Loki.
5910000	5916000	Yes. We'll just talk about halo, halo, halo, halo, halo, and more halo. But first we're going to talk about Soul Calibur 6.
5917000	5918000	You're the one that will get the death penalty, not me.
5919000	5930000	I'm not afraid of death. Um, Soul Calibur 6 has gone gold apparently and there's some more, um, character and story details coming soon.
5931000	5938000	Um, so there's a tweet that our souls are burned into the disc. Let's see how much fuel I have left.
5938000	5951000	And then, you know, I guess I'm assuming that there's going to be an announcement at Gamescom that we're going to have, um, about Soul Calibur 6 and its story and stuff. So that'd be pretty cool.
5952000	5961000	Um, apparently there's going to be an upcoming season pass as well, which is going to include four additional characters additionally, um, or in addition to the 17 already announced.
5961000	5977000	And that they said that the, I don't know, um, yeah, due out on the 18th of October. So I'm guessing that we're going to be seeing some more information come this week during Gamescom.
5978000	5982000	Absolutely. Yay. I can't wait for Soul Calibur 6.
5983000	5988000	All right. And then, um, did they already, are they going to have guest characters this time?
5988000	5997000	You know, what was funny is I was thinking of that today. I was like, did they ever announce who the guest character was? And yes, they did. And we covered it some time ago. It is Geralt from The Witcher.
5998000	6002000	Oh, right, right. I wasn't sure if that was like a, you know, system specific thing, but I guess.
6003000	6009000	No, it's kind of like Ezio. The last round was in Soul Calibur 5 was in all the games. They, they, I think, uh, four was the last time they had.
6010000	6012000	Gone the days of Darth Vader and Yoda.
6012000	6018000	Well, but even then, if I remember right, it started that way and then they made the other DLC. Like you could download Yoda.
6019000	6027000	Yeah. So even then it still ended up being all the same. So I think the last like true, true separate exclusives was probably two. Did, did three have exclusive?
6028000	6034000	I'm trying to remember if three had an exclusive character, a guest character on three, but three was only on PlayStation. It was not on Xbox.
6034000	6042000	Yeah. So I don't know, but obviously everyone remembers Soul Calibur two because everybody remembers link and the GameCube version of the game, which was amazing. So yeah.
6043000	6051000	But, uh, Geralt is the, uh, from The Witcher is the guest character at this time around. Cool. Yeah. All right. And then a PlayStation VR hits 3 million in sales.
6052000	6057000	They've sold 3 million. So VR is dead. Of course. I'm hoping to see some more.
6058000	6064000	Well, I know they have more VR games coming out, but I'm hoping to see some more VR games come out.
6065000	6070000	I, I've still been a very bad boy and not really playing my PlayStation VR, but you see my living room. It's a disaster.
6071000	6080000	It's going to happen eventually. I mean, the Tetris is when Tetris comes out, it's fucking happening. Like I'm so excited. What did they, do they have that game dated yet?
6080000	6092000	I think it's October. I think it's October. I'm so excited. But, uh, there's some YouTube's out there where you can like really see it. Like they, they showed a lot more from, from E3 and, but rez rez is pretty awesome.
6093000	6102000	I played rez in VR. I want to play that. There's other VR stuff I want to play too. Uh, you got me the, uh, as much as I am not the biggest fan of boo jumpscare games, I will play it.
6102000	6106000	It's not all that jump. I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's fun. I love that game.
6107000	6112000	I played it when Shane brought his thing. Cause you know, he loves until dawn. He brought his VR over one play. He made me play it. It was, it was fun.
6113000	6121000	I love that game. It was like, seriously, my, my most favorite game on there. And I hope they make a sequel to it someday because it's fantastic. It's, it's just such a fun game.
6122000	6128000	Until dawn or the rush of blood, the rush of blood, like an until dawn two is a gimme like there that has to be under development.
6128000	6134000	Like they, I don't think they've officially announced it, but I would be, I would be floored if that game is not under development.
6135000	6148000	Or at the very least, like, you know, being that it can do rollercoasters pretty well, I'd love to see like a rollercoaster game that didn't suck cause they have like a, there's one that's like, Oh, build your own rollercoaster game is made in unity. But it was shit. It was absolute dog shit.
6149000	6160000	What do you think this means? So for VR, cause that's, that's pretty good. I can't imagine the HTC Vive and, and Oculus have reached similar numbers because I mean, and that's not, it's just a PC.
6161000	6168000	It's a little, you have to be a little more hobbyist enthusiast to really kind of, whereas PlayStation VR is very plug and play, which was what it was always going to be.
6169000	6173000	We knew this when they announced it for PlayStation. It's going to be a great like entry level VR for people.
6173000	6182000	I still want to get like a VR set up for my computer because my computer can run. I've got 10 60 in it, so I can run it. Um, I just don't know.
6183000	6189000	And I think a big problem with VR and much like you want the other motion gaming that they had is you need the space for it.
6190000	6200000	And I granted, like, I know that not everything requires me to stand up and that's why until dawn rush of blood is fantastic because you can just sit there in a chair and play the whole game.
6200000	6204000	In fact, they actually, it's better to kind of sit there in a chair and play the game.
6205000	6208000	The other reason why I want to set up the PlayStation VR, you can do the 3D Blu-rays.
6209000	6216000	Yes. Remember that? Tron. I have Tron 3D Blu-ray. I do have that. I think that's like one of two 3D Blu-rays I own. Tron and the Lion King.
6219000	6226000	Why not? Sure. An interesting double feature night. Yeah. Yes. I do want to watch Tron in 3D again. That'd be awesome.
6226000	6233000	But, uh, God, like anything, Tron and VR would be fantastic. Why hasn't that been a thing?
6234000	6240000	Well, because Tron video game didn't do too well. It wasn't. Well, that's because it wasn't VR. I mean, we had, I don't know.
6241000	6249000	I think it was for plenty of reasons. We're going to have to have somebody make something that it's in the cyberspace and it looks like Tron, but it's not Tron.
6250000	6263000	All right. Well, didn't, didn't they do that with, um, uh, Saints Row, fucking the universe. They go into the universe. That's all like Tron theme is like, it's not Tron wink, the cyberpunk stuff.
6264000	6275000	Yes. They do like the whole, like, Oh, we're going into a computer thing. And okay. But it's like, all right, because I mean, well, this is like back when the matrix is supposed to be a thing.
6275000	6280000	It was supposed to be the dominate tricks. Get it? Ha ha ha. Right. Right. S and M ha ha matrix.
6281000	6285000	Uh, let's see. Tiger class says, if we get a new Tron VR game, it will probably be when they reboot the Tron movie.
6286000	6294000	Uh, sadly I'm losing hope that Tron three is ever going to happen because the, the actor and actress, Olivia Wilde, is that her name?
6295000	6302000	And, uh, Garrett Hedlund, like surely their contract, like they're holding windows gotta be coming up like that. You can only hold them for so long to make them do it.
6302000	6314000	And, uh, I don't know if that's still going to be there. I just see bad. They have like a really awesome premise and it's just like, it sounds like if you know what you believe or whatever, uh, tomorrow land.
6315000	6319000	Remember that George Clooney movie that tanked called tomorrow land. That is why there's not a new Tron movie.
6320000	6330000	I know. I think it's shitty too, but that's, well, it's because they found out, Hey, we can spend money and make a Tron movie, which might make its money back.
6330000	6350000	Or we can make yet another Star Wars movie. The cram that, that didn't help. I mean, that's also one of the downsides to Disney having got Star Wars is that that's their scifi thing now, you know, but here's, you know, all hope is not lost because remember we are getting that Tron ride has been so successful in Shanghai.
6351000	6358000	They are bringing it to Disney. It does look fucking awesome. I've watched the right, the, the, you know, I have never been to Disney world.
6358000	6370000	I will go to Disney world when Tron ride happens, Bobby black Wolf. I know you'll be there too. When Trump ride happens, I'm going to find, I don't even think Bobby black Wolf does roller coasters, but I feel like he's going to do that one night.
6371000	6379000	I feel like that'll be, that'll be the day he gets over it real fast, all that bad. I mean, it is, no, it doesn't go upside down or anything like that. It's, but you do have to lean forward. That's a little weird.
6379000	6391000	It kind of just looks like the, uh, the radiator Springs racers kind of just amped up a little more. It's kind of what that looks is what the Tron ride looks like to me, but I'm fucking doing it.
6392000	6402000	Like I'm so, and I feel like maybe if that does like really fucking well and like it shows that there's interest and the merchandise sells and all that stuff, then people, cause you know, there's going to be all new merchandise and they opened up that right here.
6403000	6414000	So that's, what's going to have to sell really crazy. I, I really don't understand. Like I get it. Like, let's not make Tron a movie or something like that, but they can do like the show was supposed to be pretty cool.
6415000	6424000	Like I watched like the first episode of the show cause I didn't have whatever Disney channel that was on and that was pretty awesome. No, I should really go and download the rest of that stuff. I should go find that somewhere.
6424000	6435000	And Bobby Black Wolf confirms in chat. I will do this one. I love radio Springs racers, i.e. test track in Florida, which is the ride it's basically adapted from. So right. Yeah.
6436000	6441000	Yeah. I figured Bobby and his roller coaster, like he's going to, he's going to, there's exceptions to every rule and Tron will get around the world.
6442000	6446000	I like what they did with California Screamin' now that it's the Incredicoaster. That looks pretty awesome.
6447000	6450000	Yeah. You know, I thought I'd be really pissed off about it, but it looks kind of fun.
6450000	6455000	It's kind of neat. Yeah. I'm going to miss Neil Patrick Harris though as the voice on the ride, but that's it. Yeah.
6458000	6464000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundry Radio at vognetwork.com use the passphrase scale.
6465000	6472000	All right. Anyhow, moving on. Let's talk about, let's talk about Sonic and more importantly, Sonic shitty friends. That's right.
6473000	6484000	We have some more characters announced for team Sonic racing, such as memorable favorites from the series, including alligator guy, silver, silver, the hedgehog blaze, the cat and alligator guy.
6485000	6492000	That's his name is actually King K rule. No, it's not. It's vector of the crocodile, but look at the car. Look at the car. He drives Loki. What is that?
6492000	6500000	That is a fucking Tron mobile. Actually. I believe that's a silver hedgehog's car. Cause I think, uh, I think, uh, alligator, I'm sorry.
6501000	6507000	Vector drives this little thing with the chompy thing. And then I think she drives that generic character. She drives that purple thing in the back.
6508000	6515000	So this, this is look, he has little Tron discs in his arm. So silver, the hedgehog is like Tron as character.
6515000	6529000	Riddler. No. Anyway, sadly, no Danica Patrick announced yet, but those are the latest characters in supersonic race. No team Sonic racing. Sorry. Hopefully I'll have a catchy theme song.
6530000	6546000	Uh, if you were looking forward to the spiral remaster trilogy, I'm sorry to report it has been delayed is delayed back to November 13th. That is like two months back from the original plan date of September 21st.
6546000	6559000	Uh, apparently, uh, the developer has said it needed more love and care. So a delay was necessary. Uh, the quote says everyone here at toys for Bob is so proud to be reigniting the original spiral trilogy after all these years.
6560000	6569000	We're deeply committed to getting these games, right? So we've decided to move the release date of spiral reignited trilogy to November 13th, 2018 more love and care.
6569000	6579000	I will bet money. You know what that's code for? You know what that's code for? I'm a bet money on this failed certification, but they're not going to say it failed certification on one of the platforms.
6580000	6586000	So now they have to put push it back as that. And that should, that they should take the time to get it right.
6587000	6592000	But usually like when they're, when they're very fucking vague about why the game got failed certification.
6593000	6604000	Deb's tweet me and tell me I'm lying. Sorry. I tell me I'm lying at mr Rob Roberts tweet me and tell me I'm lying. Failed certification. Sorry to hear that. Hope you pass the next one.
6605000	6617000	All right. It just, but it does make you kind of go, well, what fucking happened that it made it fail certification, but like the littlest, to be fair, the littlest thing can fuck it up.
6617000	6627000	Like if they, if they referred to the wrong button on the wrong console in one place, background color is wrong for our logo. It will, it will fuck flunk certification.
6628000	6638000	All right. Uh, let's travel around the world and check out what's coming out in stores with some release dates. What we'll get to play a little sooner. The games that have passed certification.
6638000	6649000	Yes, this game has passed certification. Get ready, Sonic. Get ready, Mario, because there's now, oh, and I should also say get ready Sanrio because technically that's also a racing game.
6650000	6659000	Now you're going to have to compete against all star fruit racing coming to the Nintendo switch. I haven't been contacted about being in a game. Sorry.
6659000	6673000	Also for not an all star. I actually saw this on a coming soon banner thing that they had at GameStop today. So it's, what do you race is like banana and grapes. What is, what is it?
6673000	6688000	It is basically imagine like if you will, uh, what like, um, you know, in wreck it Ralph, there's the whole, you know, candy racing game there. Sugar rush.
6689000	6697000	But imagine if sugar rush was designed by dentists and it was all about, you know, fruit. So it's sugar rush.
6697000	6709000	But when they made the cookie monster start talking about vegetables, it's, it's, it's all, you know, it's all fruit cars now. So they're throwing like strawberries at each other.
6710000	6724000	Nine out of 10. Dennis approved a fruit racing. It looks cute. I don't know what the game looks like, but so it's not, it's not like, like the California raisins and the fruit of the loom annoying orange.
6724000	6740000	It's not like actual fruit, right? It's just, yeah, like I'm looking at, I'm really, really quickly just kind of browsing. Um, what it looks like, it looks, looks decent. I mean, it's pretty, it, it's got, I don't know.
6740000	6753000	Yeah, no, no, no one. Eric asked game. No one here is getting this game next game. I'll get it on sale. Sure. Uh, anyways, so then the next game that we have coming a little bit more well known guacamelee too.
6754000	6763000	That's coming out on PC and PlayStation four coming to the brand new Nintendo system. The super NES return of double dragon.
6766000	6782000	It's coming to NES. Wait, like the actual like SNES according to this. Yeah. Okay. I'm supposed, I'm supposed to believe this. Sure. I don't know if that's actually legit, but maybe, um, but return double dragon coming out in the SNES.
6783000	6793000	Also this week we're finally getting the remasters of Shenmue one and two. Those are on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one. Um, as mentioned before gone home is coming out on the switch this week.
6793000	6809000	Also my hero one's justice that's coming out on the switch and PlayStation four. And finally, um, we have a C formula one 2018 coming out on PC places for Xbox one little dragons cafe on the switch and PlayStation four.
6809000	6820000	And Rob, I know you've got to be excited about this coming to the Nintendo switch night trap, 25th anniversary edition. I'm kind of overnight trap at this point. Like it was funny.
6820000	6831000	Like the first time they're like, we're going to bring back night trap. I was like, Oh yeah, that game was so horrible. And now it's like, it was like the seventh time. It's like, guess what guys? Night traps coming back on the switch. I'm like, fuck off. We're done.
6831000	6840000	Now it's coming. I'm excited though. Cause not this week, but next week, donut country's coming out and that game I am all over.
6840000	6849000	Uh, chat on the double dragon thing, dark to see it says, don't forget return to double dragon is the Japanese improved version of super double dragon. I know I've brought it up before.
6849000	6865000	I Rama says the same thing. Return of double dragons is direct version of super double dragon. So, uh, and Bobby black Wolfen chat pointing out night trap will never come out on a Nintendo system said Nintendo to Congress in 1992 under oath.
6865000	6879000	They have lied. Arrest ready. Reggie fees may immediately, except he wasn't the one that said it. It was probably Howard Phillips who's probably enjoying retirement somewhere, you know, in the mountains of Seattle.
6879000	6894000	So fucking the FBI kicks down his door for us. Stop it. All right. Times have changed. All right, let's travel to Japan and Bobby black will says arrest both Howard Phillips and Nestor.
6894000	6907000	Pin it on Nestor. That's, that's what to do. Pin it on them. I want to see before, you know, you know, eventually there's going to be, oh my God, that should be the smash character. They do that would be awesome.
6907000	6919000	How would that, wouldn't you, I would lose my shit if that was like the last character they ever reveal was Nestor. That would be fucking bad ass. I'm sorry. Like you can take your Goku and shove it if we get no, no, no.
6919000	6929000	Even better. Like, you know how they always have like a mysterious villain. That's like the, you know, the big boss of the game or something like that. Yeah. Hidden shadows eventually become, you know, reveal that it's Nestor.
6929000	6946000	Oh my God. Was Nestor a thing in Japan or was that like only like is because the problem is if Nestor was not in Japan, which I don't know if Nintendo power even really was the thing over there, then I don't think it's going to happen before the animated super Mario brother movie, which will eventually get, I want to see a Howard and Nestor short.
6946000	6958000	Okay. All right. Can we travel to Japan? So we can travel in Japan. Let's check out the releases in Japan. Cause last week was kind of slow. This week it picks up again. We've got quite a few releases on the PlayStation four, including Boku no Hero Academia.
6958000	6968000	One's Justice, Floral Flow Love comes out this week, as well as a game called Boku to Nersu no Kenshu Nishi in regular and premium edition.
6968000	6982000	And Sayaku Naru Sayaku Ninjen ni Sasadgu comes out this week from Kemco and Gun Grave VR, the complete edition is out this week from XSeed as well as Conan Outcasts.
6982000	6994000	And this game sounds interesting to me, Liar Princess and the Blind Prince. I've never, never heard of that game, but that could be interesting. So there is that coming out on the PlayStation four this week as well.
6994000	7011000	On the Vita, Floral Flow Love and Koroshia to Strawberry comes out on the Vita cause the Vita still gets games in Japan. And then lastly on the Nintendo Switch this week, that same Liar Princess game as well as Boku no Hero Academia, One's Justice both out on the Switch this week.
7011000	7013000	Loki, would you shoot the UK for us?
7013000	7021000	Yes. So there's a game coming out that you might have heard of, Shenmue 1 and 2. Those are going to be, of course, remastered on PlayStation four and Xbox one.
7021000	7031000	A game that's called Mother Gun Ship. That's a fucking awesome name. It's a roguelike first person shooter shmup game. That's also on PlayStation four and Xbox one.
7031000	7050000	Formula One 2018. That's on PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC. A game called Punch Line coming to PlayStation four. And then finally, Warhammer 40K Inquisitor Martyr. And that's on Xbox one and PlayStation four.
7051000	7066000	Okay. Let's get to the mailbag because every week you send us email and we read it here. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place where you can send emails to us to read on the show.
7066000	7077000	I'm reading these emails for a little bit while Jamie is out of the office for an extended period. Let's get to our first email tonight from Robert M who says, first of all, this is more for Jamie.
7077000	7090000	Well, too bad. She's not here, so it's for me. When I'm listening to the classic game of the week on most Mondays, I sometimes look on Wikipedia, one of a few websites or one of a few sites with gaming information not blocked at work for more information.
7090000	7097000	And I'm generally disappointed to find that the online article pretty well matches up with what was discussed. Of course, I'm not accusing anyone of wrongdoing.
7097000	7106000	Nobody there is being paid for these pieces and nobody else's opinions are being presented as your own. Just presenting the source factual information, including critical reception.
7106000	7115000	And yeah, we're not going to hide it. She uses Wikipedia as a source. A lot of us use Wikipedia as a source, but there's a lot of stuff that's interjected with our personal opinions and our stories as well.
7115000	7121000	And, you know, a lot of the reason why these games are picked in the first place usually has to do with some type of memory or something.
7121000	7131000	But it is an awfully convenient place where everything is kind of all in one place. And so, you know, that's oftentimes a go-to spot to get information.
7132000	7141000	Plot twist, I've done the same thing. My question is, what other sources does Jamie typically use besides Wikipedia and her own experience with the games?
7141000	7147000	I have seen other websites come up, especially for some of the more obscure stuff. I know Atariage has been used before for some of those classics.
7147000	7155000	I know there are some games that have dedicated websites sometimes. I mean, they can be found with a simple Google search.
7155000	7161000	If you go in and actually Google some of the other classic games, and usually these are things that are like, they were so obscure, they didn't even have a Wiki page.
7161000	7172000	Which has been some of the games that have been selected in the past. So, a lot of times there will be like, just like a fan website compilation of things that has been used before.
7172000	7182000	But I know Atariage has been used as a resource before. And I want to say Game Facts came up once, too. I remember thinking that was an interesting source that was there, too.
7182000	7190000	Honestly, if a simple Google search brings it up, you can probably find some of the other same websites, honestly.
7190000	7198000	Dungeon Buster in Chat says, Wikipedia is as good as a springboard. The citations and links at the end of the articles often lead to more interesting places.
7198000	7209000	Exactly. I think that's a good way to look at it. Wikipedia is a good compilation. It's a springboard. But, you know, then that leads to the discussion on everything else about the game and the memories and so forth.
7209000	7213000	Moby Games. Thank you, ActDeaf. I think that's one that's come up as well, too, Moby Games.
7213000	7227000	Anyhow, continuing on with Robert M's email. And, of course, this might be more for Rama, but I really hope someone does a Cells at Work AMV to They Might Be Giants The Bloodmobile.
7227000	7233000	I don't, that doesn't mean anything to me, so I'm hoping Rama gets that joke and will like LOL in chat or something like that. Anyway.
7234000	7243000	Robert M signs that email saying, also wants to see a skit where Rama Satome is splashed with water and turns into a sports car. So, maybe. Alright.
7243000	7247000	I mean, that's kind of silly. That's a whole GoBots thing.
7247000	7251000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat suggests Emu Paradise. Oops, not anymore.
7251000	7256000	Well, no. They still have information about stuff. You just can't download the ROMs there.
7256000	7262000	Yeah. So, honestly, they would probably love it if you'd use them as a resource. Did you know what I learned this week? They follow me on Twitter.
7262000	7267000	I've never, and I guess I follow them back, and I never really realized that until I started seeing all the tweets this week in my timeline.
7267000	7271000	I was like, oh, I never realized I actually followed that website on Twitter.
7271000	7278000	Hi, guys. Does anyone want to come on the show? Anyway, one more email tonight from YYR.
7278000	7283000	And, again, if you want to email us, and I think you should, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7283000	7290000	By the way, Rama, answering your question in chat, Robert M., Rama says, actually, I do cells at work to Weird Al.
7290000	7293000	Calling in sick. Anyway.
7293000	7297000	Let's get to YYR's email. Second and last email tonight.
7297000	7301000	Hello, LR. Long time listener, long time email. Hurt derp.
7301000	7305000	As I mentioned last week, I've been catching up on the episodes of OLR that I missed due to newbornitis.
7305000	7310000	On the July 1st episode, Loki once again lamented that his kids keep asking for Nintendo Labo,
7310000	7313000	but that $70 is way too much to pay for cardboard.
7313000	7318000	As a kid, I never saw myself growing up to one day defend inanimate pieces of cardboard, but here goes.
7318000	7322000	I believe that this is akin to saying, why are video games in the store $60?
7322000	7325000	Why am I paying $60 for a plastic disc?
7325000	7329000	The answer is that you're not paying for the plastic disc, you're paying for the experience that can be had with the disc,
7329000	7332000	and you're paying for the efforts of people who created said experience.
7332000	7337000	I have no concept of the amount of effort that must have gone into engineering and testing the Nintendo Labo variety kit,
7338000	7340000	which allows you to build several different projects.
7340000	7345000	But what I can tell you is that I bought one of these kits, and that during my teenage niece's recent visit,
7345000	7347000	she decided to build the Labo piano.
7347000	7352000	I balked at the menu screen's proclamation that it would take approximately 150 to 210 minutes to build,
7352000	7354000	but she didn't. She jumped right in.
7354000	7360000	The software gave her steps to follow one by one, specifically showing her what to punch out and where to fold every fold.
7360000	7361000	I got tired and went to bed.
7361000	7366000	When I woke up in the morning, there was a cardboard piano on our living room table with keys that actually pushed down,
7366000	7369000	and when you use the software's play mode, yes, it actually works.
7369000	7373000	Turns out it did take about three hours, and my niece had a lot of fun building it.
7373000	7376000	So when you put your money down on Labo, you are not only getting cardboard,
7376000	7379000	you are also getting several hours' worth of the building experience.
7379000	7382000	When you are finished, you don't just have a cardboard piano,
7382000	7386000	you have a working cardboard piano that you actually built yourself and can be proud of.
7386000	7391000	Even if you choose to toss it afterwards, you'll probably remember and look back on that experience, which can't be thrown away.
7391000	7394000	So I would recommend that you approach Labo like this.
7394000	7398000	Think of it as spending your money on the experience, not on the actual items contained in the box.
7398000	7402000	Although if you think about it, doesn't this apply to just about every video game we buy?
7402000	7406000	For the love of cardboard pianos, Aaron, YYR.
7406000	7408000	That's a sweet story, YYR.
7408000	7413000	I just don't see a similar story in my future, and that's why me personally, I'm not going to get Labo.
7413000	7417000	Do I understand why Labo is good for other people? Yes, I think it's great.
7417000	7423000	But for me personally, I would build the piano, which, I mean, I guess you could say would be an experience,
7423000	7427000	but, I mean, building IKEA furniture is also an experience.
7427000	7431000	A non-positive one if you have to do anything with their online customer service.
7431000	7435000	If you want to guarantee Alan and I to fight, have us build IKEA furniture.
7435000	7438000	Any bang-up fight we've ever been in has been over building furniture.
7438000	7441000	Oh no, IKEA furniture building is fucking easy.
7441000	7444000	I'm talking about dealing with their customer service department.
7444000	7446000	Oh, no.
7446000	7451000	If there's any knowledge that you can gain from this show today, it's this.
7451000	7456000	Never, ever order IKEA furniture through their online store.
7456000	7462000	You can shop online, you can browse online, but you purchase that shit in the fucking store.
7462000	7467000	You do not purchase it online, because they will fuck that shit up.
7467000	7469000	Okay, okay. Here's the thing though.
7469000	7474000	And I think I'm pretty sure I said this about Labo when it first came out, if I didn't allow me to say it now.
7474000	7479000	I would have ate this shit up if I was ten years old right now, and this stuff was coming out.
7479000	7482000	This would have been completely up my alley, I would have loved it.
7482000	7487000	Now, I'm honestly looking at it going, this is just going to be shit in my house.
7487000	7491000	And the thing is for me, that the games that they're coming, they're not really games.
7491000	7493000	They're tech demos that use the cardboard.
7493000	7499000	Which again, for kids to be like, wow, this thing that I built is so cool.
7499000	7501000	That's awesome, that's great.
7501000	7507000	For me, the 40 year old different gamer in a different place in his life, I'm just going to be like,
7507000	7510000	woo, I built it, I pushed buttons, things happen, yay.
7510000	7513000	I mean, is this keyboard mania? No. Is it a music? No.
7513000	7518000	It's just a little piano experience, which I'm sure will be fun for five minutes.
7518000	7521000	But for me, it's just not ultimately going to be worth $70 at the end of the day.
7521000	7525000	And it's not that I don't think, well, I still think it's expensive.
7525000	7529000	So I give it that for what it is. I still think it's expensive.
7529000	7533000	Yeah, you can argue that there's dev time in there, but I, whatever, okay.
7533000	7539000	For me though, it's I know my kids and I know my kids and how they do stuff.
7539000	7546000	And we have so much in the way of Legos that they don't want to build them.
7546000	7549000	They want to play with them and then they get bored with them immediately.
7549000	7556000	And so if I buy this, I'm going to be building all the projects, which is fine because I like doing that kind of shit anyways.
7556000	7560000	I will show it to them. They'll mess around with it for a little bit.
7560000	7565000	They'll fight over something and then they'll go back to playing on their tablets because that's what they do.
7565000	7571000	Or they'll just play Mario Odyssey. Like every time we go into a GameStop, it's, oh, I want to play the Mario Odyssey demo.
7571000	7576000	I'm like, you literally, I just literally took the switch away from you before we left.
7576000	7580000	You were playing Mario Odyssey and you're going to play Mario Odyssey again.
7580000	7584000	It's like, what the fuck? I mean, why are you guys fighting over this? We have this at home.
7584000	7592000	Stop it. I was like, I want to play Mario Kart, but we have it at home. You just got done playing with it at home.
7592000	7595000	It's like, fucking do something and I'll play a different game.
7595000	7601000	You know what, though? When I was younger, I would play Atari 2600 at home and then they would have the kiosk at the store and I would want to play Atari 2600 there.
7601000	7603000	Like, cause I, I picked up like,
7603000	7607000	But of course I would get to play different games on the, cause one of the stories you could flip between like 30 different games.
7607000	7610000	Cause I would pick up games that I thought my kids would like.
7610000	7617000	Like I buy, you know, oh, hey, here's this Mario and Rabbids game, you know, cause they said, oh, I really want to get that game.
7617000	7619000	I want to get some Mario game. I want to get it.
7619000	7621000	Fine. So I picked it.
7621000	7623000	Yeah. So I picked it up.
7623000	7625000	How often does that game get played?
7625000	7630000	Never. It never fucking gets played, you know, or it's just, they play the same thing.
7630000	7632000	I'm going to die if I don't get that game.
7632000	7637000	For some kids who like building and stuff, then yes, that would be perfect for them.
7637000	7639000	My kids sadly are not like that.
7639000	7647000	They're not like I was where I would sit quietly in the house and I would build stuff all day long with whatever I had in front of me.
7647000	7651000	So the point is YYR, be thankful your niece doesn't have low-key seats.
7651000	7661000	You'll know when your kids get older and you're like, and you're, you spend this money, like you buy them a trampoline and you're sick of your living room because you thought for some fucking reason that's going to be a great idea.
7661000	7666000	And then they play with it for a while and you're like, Oh, look, it's so nice that they're enjoying something.
7666000	7670000	And then they stop. And then it's like, it's like a cat.
7670000	7673000	You buy the cat a bunch of toys and it wants to play in the box.
7673000	7677000	And it's just, that's just kids and cats for you.
7677000	7683000	I'm going to chat at live.voggenetwork.com. Tiger class says, I bet Loki acted like his kid when he was his age.
7683000	7685000	I don't doubt that for a minute.
7685000	7687000	I did not. I was not a fucking terror like this.
7687000	7690000	I can ask my parents. I was quiet and I play.
7690000	7695000	Well, my wife says it's because she thinks I have Asperger's because, you know, of course, it's good.
7695000	7697000	That was nice. Your wife to sell that.
7697000	7699000	She tells me that all the time that I have Asperger's.
7699000	7701000	OK, I don't want I don't want to make light of what I understand.
7701000	7709000	But I'm just saying, because I am an introvert and I sit quietly and I will mess around with blocks or Legos or whatever for a long time.
7709000	7714000	And if you if you think there's something there, talk to a doctor.
7714000	7717000	I have. And they said, are you fucking crazy?
7717000	7724000	No, actually, they said that they don't know how to test adults, which doesn't make any sense considering I know adults that have been diagnosed.
7724000	7726000	OK, whatever. Maybe you need a doctor. All right.
7726000	7730000	I don't want to. This is a slippery slope because I know people.
7730000	7734000	This is a very serious thing for it. I don't want to make light of it. Right. Yeah.
7734000	7743000	So anyway, let's move on and talk about if you want to send an email, participate at orange launch radio dot com.
7743000	7751000	If you want to send us an email at a later time. And again, I, I, I think that's great that Labo is doing for other people.
7751000	7755000	Oh, the one thing I want to say about the disk comparison, the new one looks neat. The new driving one.
7755000	7760000	Here's the thing about the disk, though. When I get a sixty dollar disk like Kingdom Hearts three,
7760000	7764000	I know I'm going to play that for hours and hours and hours because I'm going to get what I want out of that,
7764000	7768000	which is a fully realized, fleshed out story game adventure thing.
7768000	7775000	I'm not getting like a tech demo, whereas Labo is kind of like tech demos and tech demos are cool for a minute.
7775000	7779000	Yeah. Nintendo is pretty guilty of doing this like time and time again.
7779000	7785000	Like, don't get me wrong, like I get it. We sports was a success and that was kind of a tech demo at the time.
7785000	7790000	The show off, you know, the capabilities of the Wii, but you can't keep doing that shit over and over.
7790000	7796000	Like we play and we sports plus and this and that. You know, I get it.
7796000	7802000	It's a neat idea. But what beyond the there's not like a deep gameplay there.
7802000	7809000	It's just you build the thing, you mess around with it a little bit and it's supposed to like inspire me to create new things.
7809000	7813000	Cool, but not really. I don't know.
7813000	7818000	All right. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.
7818000	7822000	Meanwhile, let's get back into some more gaming news. Loki.
7822000	7825000	OK. And of course, sorry, of course, I have to plug the Skype line.
7825000	7831000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, if you want to give us a call a little later in the show.
7831000	7841000	So let's talk about once again, this Philip Musen, who was the guy that plagiarized stuff on IGN and then got fired from IGN.
7841000	7850000	We plagiarized his one reviewed Dead Cells. And then now he basically he went out on YouTube and.
7850000	7857000	Said, hey, you didn't really apologize for it and stuff and kind of like from what I understood,
7857000	7866000	just like kind of watching parts of it is kind of like, well, you know, this this has never really happened to me before, you know.
7866000	7878000	So good luck finding anything that else out there that plagiarized into which people looked at everything and found dozens of things that he's plagiarized and his different reviews.
7878000	7885000	And so because of that, IGN has actually gone back and they have removed all of his reviews from the site that he's done.
7886000	7891000	So. I mean, that's definitely interesting.
7891000	7898000	Basically, you know, there's a long list, including there's a band to review that he took inspiration from Polygon.
7898000	7910000	There was a video that he did on his channel that is basically reading expert excerpts from Wikipedia about Super Mario Odyssey and Shante Half Genie Hero.
7910000	7924000	Also, there's one that it was almost a word for word reading of a Neogaf post, even his LinkedIn as his resume is copied from a job template website.
7924000	7933000	So kind of silly, but, you know, I guess there's a certain definite pattern of behavior.
7934000	7941000	So. Is, of course, very.
7941000	7947000	It makes sense that why IGN would have removed all of his content off the site, because God knows where it came from.
7947000	7949000	God knows what else was plagiarism.
7949000	7956000	I don't know, like there's a part of me that's like, you know, God, like, you know, the entire Internet is just dragging this guy.
7956000	7957000	And I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it.
7958000	7963000	There's a part of me that kind of goes like, I wonder if he's like, sick.
7963000	7971000	Like, I wonder if this is something where like this like copy pasting thing and taking credit for it is some sort of like there's like a deeper thing.
7971000	7977000	You know, and again, I don't want to like make light of serious conditions for the second time here on the show.
7977000	7982000	But I'm just like, there is definitely that part of me is like, I hope this, you know, like I it sucks this guy did it.
7982000	7987000	And he deserved to not be writing for IGN because there are people that would have given everything to do that.
7987000	7990000	And he took opportunities like I don't want to like, you know, pretend like any of that.
7990000	7992000	But there's a part of me that says, you know what?
7992000	7996000	Instead of continuing to like kick this guy when he's down, I just kind of like I hope he finds peace.
7996000	8002000	I hope he's able to get to the bottom of why he felt this was OK for so long.
8002000	8011000	And like, I just I just God, I hope I hope he's able to, I guess, to quote the old Tyra Banks thing I quote a million times on this show.
8011000	8013000	Learn something from this, I hope.
8013000	8017000	Well, I mean, I just sounds like he's been doing this for a while.
8017000	8021000	So, I mean, he's probably figured, well, it's worked for me so far.
8021000	8026000	It's just that and it could I mean, I don't know, maybe he doesn't really think he's doing anything wrong.
8026000	8031000	Like he's like, well, I'm just phrasing things in a similar way or I'm you know, but I don't know.
8032000	8038000	But if that was the case, then like there'd be a lot of people accusing other articles of, you know.
8038000	8042000	I know, I was like in games journalism, though, like for real, for real.
8042000	8047000	Like we just talked about how the whole like classic Game of the Week thing is like kind of inspired by Wikipedia.
8047000	8051000	Now, here's the thing. I've never claimed to report news here on this show.
8051000	8055000	We discuss news. And so, yes, of course, we use a lot of various.
8055000	8058000	Yeah, we're not publishing information on a Web site.
8058000	8062000	Exactly. No, we're bringing some of the table and talking about it, you know, and that whole thing is what we're doing.
8062000	8068000	And like honestly, guys, like I would say 90 percent of podcasts you're listening to are probably doing a very, very, very similar thing.
8068000	8069000	And we're certainly hiring writers.
8069000	8074000	Yeah, we're the writers, you know, but the whole thing is free. Right.
8074000	8083000	So but anyway, my point with it all is like, honestly, since we do see so many different gaming Web sites with so many different topics and so forth,
8083000	8089000	like we also see like how many times is the same line just kind of run over and over on all these different sites?
8089000	8096000	Like people have straight up made up lies to see how far it goes and how many Web sites kind of copy paste the same thing,
8096000	8101000	or how many Web sites will just take the press release and massage a few words here, a few words there.
8101000	8105000	And that's the article that they publish. Like, you know what I mean?
8105000	8112000	I think where things got into a really sticky situation with this is that this went beyond news.
8112000	8120000	This went to opinion. That was the big no-no is that when it came to reviews and opinion, you can't copy.
8120000	8125000	It's one thing to regurgitate the news. You can't just regurgitate somebody's opinion.
8125000	8129000	You know what I mean? Like when I give you an opinion on games, that is my fucking opinion.
8129000	8135000	I might say I might reference like I was reading some people on the Internet saying this or I saw an article on such and such that said this.
8135000	8137000	You know, I might kind of throw that out there.
8137000	8147000	I can see where there might be some overlap if, like, for example, say there was like with the reviews, sometimes they'll give you information about the game, like where they're talking about different systems and whatnot.
8147000	8151000	They may have like bullet points describing the different systems in the game.
8151000	8158000	And maybe they will read both of them read off the same, you know, thing and didn't really make it their own that well.
8158000	8165000	But I don't think for the average YouTube reviewer, probably not the case.
8165000	8168000	I don't know. I just.
8168000	8173000	I think if that was the case, well, it would have been like, well, actually, you know, it wasn't copied from here.
8173000	8178000	It was reading off of this piece of, you know, this press release that I received with the review copy of this.
8178000	8183000	And so this is where I got my wording from, not this YouTube or something like that.
8183000	8187000	But that wasn't the case. It was just I didn't copy.
8187000	8191000	That was just a weird fluke. We just happen to use the same type of language.
8191000	8193000	Good luck finding more shit.
8193000	8195000	All right. Let's move on to another story.
8195000	8199000	And I'm going to read this word for word from VG 24 seven dot com.
8199000	8203000	A new report has come out suggesting that Nintendo is working on a port.
8203000	8207000	OK, no, I'm not going to read a word for word. Here's where the story is going.
8207000	8211000	They, of course, like half the Wii U games have become switch games.
8211000	8214000	Right. So what's the latest one they're talking about now?
8214000	8218000	New Super Mario Brothers U on the Wii U is the one that they're talking about getting moved over to the switch.
8218000	8225000	This is from a journalist named Liam Robertson, who I guess has this track record where it's like some of the things.
8225000	8232000	He's basically like when he reads the tea leaves, he reads them right, you know, majority of the time.
8232000	8234000	So that's where this is coming from.
8234000	8240000	He wrote this all in an article for Comic Book talking about sources that Nintendo of Europe
8240000	8246000	and other sources that he's not naming that have corroborated this information throughout the year.
8246000	8252000	This game, when it comes out, it's going to include the Luigi add on as they were doing on the Wii U towards the end of that.
8252000	8255000	You know, they were selling that as a bundle pack anyway.
8255000	8259000	So we don't know when it's going to be released.
8259000	8263000	The port could be this year is something that they're suggesting there.
8263000	8265000	I don't know why they wouldn't have announced that.
8265000	8271000	But it would also maybe lend something to why Nintendo keeps saying we have more that we haven't unveiled yet for this year.
8271000	8273000	Wink, wink, no judge.
8273000	8280000	But okay, there's also a part of me with this where it's like, okay, the new Super Mario Brothers Wii U and all that was a good game.
8280000	8283000	It's cool, but like, why not Mario Maker?
8283000	8284000	Yeah.
8284000	8292000	Why not give us all of the Mario in Mario Maker, which I think was a stronger Wii U title because you could make all this stuff.
8292000	8295000	Why not do that on the Switch? Why this?
8295000	8298000	I don't get it. I think that would be a lot easier.
8299000	8304000	Mario Maker with additional content. Oh, and then we have Super Mario Brothers 2.
8304000	8306000	Or maybe one of the Game Boy games.
8306000	8309000	Because I don't know how well two would blend with the others.
8309000	8311000	I'd like to put some things from two in there, maybe.
8311000	8317000	Okay, you know what? Do this. If you can't get an actual skin, do a Wario skin.
8317000	8322000	Where now it's Wario and everything looks funky like a WarioWare type of thing.
8322000	8326000	It's all hand drawn or something. They could come up with something that would be silly and appropriate.
8326000	8329000	So I would like to see that.
8329000	8335000	And if the release is only $20 in digital or something, then that might be cool too.
8335000	8346000	I wonder if, I'm gonna throw something else out there, maybe part of the reason they're hanging on to this is that maybe with this new version you can play with your friends online.
8346000	8349000	Because it was four player all in the same room.
8349000	8356000	So there's my little guess is that maybe the new twist is you can play with four players online.
8356000	8360000	And so that's why they're revisiting this and why it hasn't been released yet.
8360000	8362000	It's part of their big online thing.
8362000	8365000	I'm throwing a crazy tip for Hatton.
8365000	8370000	This is just not a game that I would be like, oh my god, I need to play this online. I don't know.
8370000	8371000	It's just...
8371000	8372000	No.
8372000	8374000	Thank you for the validation.
8375000	8377000	Dartitsia says, oh Rob may be onto something.
8377000	8383000	I kind of think if we're going down this road, that's where this might end up.
8383000	8385000	And for the record, that's not in the original article.
8385000	8387000	That is my prediction.
8387000	8392000	My own tea leaf reading there is that that might be the spin that they put on it to make it different.
8392000	8396000	Is that now instead of playing all in the same room, you can play across the internet.
8396000	8399000	Of course, I would think Mario Party would be the game to do that with.
8399000	8403000	But we know we're getting a Mario Party that has some kind of online functionality.
8403000	8405000	Or Mario Maker with two player mode.
8405000	8410000	I would love Mario Maker, but maybe this is the precursor to that. Who knows? I don't know.
8410000	8411000	We'll see.
8411000	8413000	Alright, Mega Man X...
8413000	8414000	Oh, my Zelda Maker!
8414000	8420000	Mega Man X400 in chat says, online, great, but without voice chat? Kind of lame.
8420000	8423000	Well, Nintendo's got an app for you, my friend.
8423000	8428000	You've probably never used it, because you have no reason to use it when you have Discord.
8428000	8431000	But did you know, Nintendo has an app, my friend.
8431000	8434000	And all your voice chat can be done through the app.
8434000	8438000	I still don't fucking get that. Especially when, was it Fortnite?
8438000	8440000	Voice chat through the console?
8440000	8441000	I know.
8441000	8444000	It's like, we can't do it. It's physically not possible.
8444000	8445000	Wait, what about that?
8445000	8447000	Uhhhh, fuck.
8447000	8451000	Alright. Let's move on, Loki.
8451000	8455000	I don't fucking get it. I don't understand.
8456000	8462000	This is exciting news, and I know it seems like every few years we read something about time splitters,
8462000	8465000	and I'm like, woo, new time splitters! But then nothing ever happens.
8465000	8468000	And that's, you know, unfortunate.
8468000	8471000	But at least this might mean something.
8471000	8478000	So THQ Nordic has acquired the licenses for, or the IP for time splitters and second sight.
8478000	8487000	And they announced, I guess, that was made through Kotch Media, which is a subsidiary of THQ Nordic.
8487000	8495000	Time splitters, of course, was considered one of the most influential console games of the early 2000s.
8495000	8499000	And then second sight, it was a science fiction action adventure game.
8499000	8505000	I never played second sight, but time splitters, I played all three of those games, and they are fucking amazing.
8505000	8513000	So, not sure what's coming with those, but I want more time splitters.
8513000	8516000	I'm down for that, whenever that happens.
8516000	8520000	Yeah, I think a lot of people are really waiting for a new entry in that series.
8520000	8528000	I mean, the pandemic was working out for a while. Now, I need it.
8528000	8533000	It's so funny to me how THQ goes under, now they're back because somebody else took the name,
8533000	8538000	and now all these old franchises are coming back. It's kind of interesting how that all goes full circle.
8538000	8543000	Alright, well, I know some of you all are very happy to see Double Dare back on TV.
8543000	8545000	Do you watch that with your kids, the new Double Dare?
8545000	8546000	No, I don't. Cable.
8546000	8549000	Uh oh, I guess that makes sense. I guess a lot of people don't in this day and age.
8549000	8552000	Well, the new Double Dare apparently is pretty good. A lot of people are enjoying it.
8552000	8555000	I haven't really watched it either. I'm just, you know, I'm kind of in your boat.
8555000	8557000	I don't really ever watch Cable anymore.
8557000	8562000	But, some people are also exploring the love of Double Dare through a new Facebook game.
8562000	8567000	Hey, remember that whole chat about Facebook Messenger really trying to push the game thing?
8567000	8572000	Well, now they've got an agreement where they've got Double Dare on Facebook Messenger.
8572000	8578000	So, you can challenge friends and keep track of who is winning on a leaderboard inside the game.
8578000	8583000	If you go to Facebook Messenger and do games, you type Double Dare, you can, I guess, find it there.
8583000	8586000	I guess it's already there. You answer Double Dare questions.
8586000	8590000	You can compete in physical challenge mini games. I have no idea how that works.
8590000	8594000	Does that use AR or something like that? Or do you have to, like, use the video somehow?
8594000	8596000	I don't know. It sounds a little shady, but whatever.
8596000	8598000	So, I haven't seen how that works yet.
8598000	8603000	So, I can't imagine you have a giant nose in your house that you have to search through to get the flag.
8603000	8606000	So, I guess they must have to get creative with some things like that.
8606000	8611000	Anyway, the play is one-on-one, but you can play it within a group chat if you want.
8611000	8615000	So, anywhere. Anyway, if you want to check that out, it is within Facebook Messenger.
8615000	8622000	I just kind of think it's neat that they have this newer property that people are into right now with Double Dare coming back.
8622000	8626000	Even though, again, I don't get how it plays like the real show.
8626000	8631000	But, hey, game shows as games, I think are, you know what?
8631000	8635000	So much of what I used to play on Commodore 64 were game show games.
8635000	8640000	Family Feud, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy, Card Sharks.
8640000	8644000	Like, all those games had Commodore 64 versions.
8644000	8647000	Most of them had Nintendo versions, too.
8647000	8651000	So, game shows always make good adaptations into games, usually.
8651000	8655000	Yeah, they had a PC game for Double Dare at Commodore 64.
8655000	8659000	Back in the day, yeah, they did. Back in the day, they sure did.
8659000	8662000	I don't think it's, you know, certainly they haven't made one in a long time.
8662000	8664000	I think there was a Double Dare game on the NES.
8664000	8666000	I might be wrong, but I think there was one there.
8666000	8670000	And then, of course, then you got games that are like game shows,
8670000	8674000	but anticipation was always super game show-y to me.
8674000	8677000	Even though, I guess it was really more of a board game,
8677000	8680000	but it kind of felt like the presentation was very much like a game show.
8680000	8683000	Man, I miss that game. Why don't they make games like Anticipation anymore?
8683000	8686000	Of course, if you play Anticipation enough, you just kind of have all the drawings memorized.
8686000	8690000	You start to see two lines, you're like, oh, house. Oh, hammer.
8690000	8692000	You know what they all are.
8692000	8694000	All right, anyhow, just a few more stories for you guys.
8694000	8698000	This is in the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8698000	8701000	All right, so this is unfortunate news,
8701000	8705000	but apparently one of the voice actors of the Pokémon series,
8705000	8708000	the voice of Professor Oak, has died.
8708000	8712000	So, voice actor Unsho Isazuka.
8712000	8718000	I've been voicing him, I guess, since 1997.
8718000	8722000	And, yeah, he passed away, unfortunately.
8722000	8726000	He did a lot more than just Professor Oak,
8726000	8729000	but I think that's where a lot of gamer people are going to know him from.
8729000	8731000	Right, yeah.
8731000	8734000	But, yeah, that's unfortunate, though,
8734000	8737000	because he's like a main character of the show.
8737000	8738000	Sure, sure.
8738000	8740000	And he wasn't all that old.
8740000	8746000	I mean, 68 or 67, I think, yeah, 68 was what he was when he passed away
8746000	8749000	due to esophageal cancer.
8749000	8751000	Ah, that sucks.
8751000	8754000	Especially when cancer gets, you know, we were talking earlier in the show
8754000	8756000	about, like, Satoru Iwata, and, you know, how, you know,
8756000	8759000	we were talking about the whole Smash Brothers moral quandary or whatever,
8759000	8760000	but, you know, he was very young when he passed,
8760000	8763000	and that was cancer-related, wasn't it, if I remember right?
8763000	8764000	Yeah, so.
8764000	8767000	And then, of course, we just lost Aretha Franklin this past week, you know.
8767000	8768000	She was a little bit old.
8768000	8770000	She was the same age as my mom when she passed,
8770000	8772000	and my mom didn't pass from cancer,
8772000	8776000	but as we all know, Aretha Franklin did, and that's, you know, also very tragic.
8776000	8780000	So, all right, anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to be a downer,
8780000	8783000	but, you know, we have to pay our respects.
8783000	8785000	And, yes, I agree with the chat room is lighting up with,
8785000	8787000	cancer sucks, fuck cancer.
8787000	8789000	Absolutely. Agreed. Fuck cancer.
8789000	8792000	All right, one more story for you guys.
8792000	8796000	This is a very kind of atypical sort of report on a new game that's coming out,
8796000	8800000	but I just, I thought this was a very neat sort of thing for gaming,
8800000	8804000	and it has to do with, like, charitable stuff in a game,
8804000	8807000	but this game also kind of takes it one step further.
8807000	8811000	Like, for example, Hellblade, Senua's Sacrifice, you know,
8811000	8816000	that game did very well, and Ninja Theory actually donated proceeds
8816000	8819000	from that game on World Mental Health Day.
8819000	8822000	They donated all the proceeds at the sale of that game,
8822000	8827000	and they also donated another $25,000 when it got to the $50,000 threshold on Xbox One.
8827000	8830000	And then there's a game called I Hope, which was a cancer treatment game,
8830000	8832000	speaking of fuck cancer.
8832000	8836000	This game, I Hope, donates the proceeds to children's cancer treatment and research.
8836000	8840000	So now we have a new game coming out from Delve Interactive
8840000	8847000	that's a game about homelessness that will donate a portion of the proceeds to homeless charities.
8847000	8853000	The game is called Change, and in Change, you actually play as a homeless individual
8853000	8858000	on the streets of a city, and the city is actually procedurally generated,
8858000	8862000	basically meaning that, you know, it's going to be infinite, I suppose.
8862000	8866000	The skills that you have and the dog that keep you company
8866000	8868000	will be the only things that you have in the game.
8868000	8870000	You will have to battle the elements.
8870000	8874000	You have to improve on skills that will let you improve the situation,
8874000	8877000	and the narrative in the game is also procedurally generated
8877000	8880000	so that your playthroughs will not be the same.
8880000	8883000	This is all coming from a three-person development team,
8883000	8887000	and they're drawing from their experience of nearly being homeless in their own shoes
8887000	8889000	when they were developing the game Poncho,
8889000	8891000	and so that's kind of the inspiration for the game.
8891000	8895000	They've also promised they will donate 20% of what the game makes
8895000	8901000	to a UK-based charity called Crysis that wants to end homelessness in our lifetime.
8901000	8906000	So I did think this was just... I just really liked the concept.
8906000	8913000	I mean, obviously, I think homelessness is a very, very tricky situation
8913000	8916000	that is hard for many people to deal with and so forth,
8916000	8922000	but I think it's really neat when a video game can kind of put you in those shoes
8922000	8926000	to think about that, to think about maybe why some of these charities
8926000	8928000	maybe need the money and so forth,
8928000	8933000	and I think that's just a really neat way that video games can kind of be expressive
8933000	8936000	when we get into this whole debate about are video games art or what's the whole deal?
8936000	8941000	I think this is a really neat expression using video games
8941000	8943000	to kind of put these feelings that these guys felt
8943000	8946000	when they were almost homeless themselves into a game and some of those challenges,
8946000	8949000	and then trying to do some real good from that.
8949000	8954000	I think with all the horrible stuff we read about with video games sometimes,
8954000	8957000	I thought this was just a really nice thing to read about.
8957000	8963000	Anyway, if you want to check this out, you can on Steam Early Access on September 18th.
8963000	8968000	They are also planning to release for iPad perhaps mobile devices as well.
8968000	8972000	That is where the game is being scheduled to be released,
8972000	8973000	so you can check that out.
8973000	8976000	So you can now give us a call if you'd like.
8976000	8980000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8980000	8984000	The Skype line is open for you to give us a call.
8984000	8989000	Go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
8989000	8993000	Some folks sharing their stories with cancer and why it pisses them off,
8993000	8996000	and yeah, it's horrible.
8996000	8998000	All right, we've got some calls coming in. Let's get to it.
8998000	9000000	And then I'll ask you for last minute stories as well, Loki.
9000000	9002000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9002000	9004000	Hey, this is Regineer.
9004000	9005000	Hey, what's on your mind tonight, Regineer?
9005000	9007000	No, a whole lot.
9007000	9018000	Since you were talking about Steam and all that earlier in the show,
9018000	9022000	I would like to pose a question to you.
9022000	9023000	Okay.
9023000	9031000	Well, everyone knows the whole back story to me and to PC Gaming,
9031000	9033000	so I won't bother retelling it now.
9033000	9035000	It'll be too long-winded.
9035000	9040000	But with that story being said,
9040000	9052000	have there been any platforms or games that you heard
9052000	9058000	other people hype up for the longest time?
9058000	9061000	And you said, you know, what's the big deal?
9061000	9062000	I won't bother.
9062000	9064000	Then you finally break down.
9064000	9067000	Why the hell did I not get into this earlier?
9067000	9069000	Yes, yes.
9069000	9071000	An answer immediately jumped in my head.
9071000	9074000	The Sega Dreamcast, easily.
9074000	9076000	When the Sega Dreamcast was new,
9076000	9078000	all these people were super into it,
9078000	9081000	and I was like, but Sega systems, they're never...
9081000	9083000	And this is a good thing Jamie isn't here,
9083000	9085000	because she'd read me up and down for this,
9085000	9087000	but this is how I used to feel and not how I feel now.
9087000	9090000	I used to be like, oh, Sega systems are not nearly as good
9090000	9092000	as the Nintendo and the other stuff that comes out.
9092000	9094000	Sega Dreamcast is going to blow, whatever.
9094000	9097000	And then finally I pick one up and I was like, oh, my God, I'm an idiot.
9097000	9100000	These games are fucking amazing, and the system deserves to do better.
9100000	9104000	I think a lot of people kind of misread the Dreamcast,
9104000	9110000	and that's part of the reason why it just didn't do as good as it deserved to.
9110000	9114000	I mean, we joke that it was ahead of its time, but it kind of was.
9114000	9117000	And some folks in chat agreeing with me there, Dungeon Busters saying,
9117000	9120000	yay, Dreamcast, Act F saying, yep, the Sega Dreamcast for me too.
9120000	9123000	I feel bad for the Dreamcast in that aspect. It was an amazing system.
9123000	9127000	Loki, do you feel similar, or is there a different thing that jumps to your mind
9127000	9129000	when we talk about platforms?
9131000	9134000	Yeah, I guess the Dreamcast, I don't know.
9134000	9136000	I wasn't really into the Dreamcast,
9136000	9140000	but then I got into it way later, when it was over.
9140000	9144000	You know what else I didn't like at first, Rage Nator? This might surprise you.
9144000	9147000	The other system I didn't like at first? The Nintendo 64.
9147000	9148000	Oh, really?
9148000	9152000	Yeah, when I first played it, I didn't get the hype with Mario.
9152000	9156000	In fact, kind of to this day, I still think Mario 64 might be a little bit overrated,
9156000	9159000	but okay, some people remember it fondly and so forth,
9159000	9163000	and I do love Mario Odyssey, so its roots are definitely in Mario 64.
9163000	9169000	But at the time, I was like, it's all blocky, and why does everything have to be 3D?
9169000	9171000	Why are they shoving 3D down our throats?
9171000	9177000	Maybe that was just me being an old man at the age of 18, or whenever the Nintendo 64 came out.
9177000	9180000	But that was a system I didn't really grow to appreciate until later on too,
9180000	9186000	because I didn't buy a Nintendo 64 until I got a big one that looked like Pikachu
9186000	9190000	that the lights lit up when you turned it on. It was really fucking adorable.
9191000	9194000	Yeah, here's the thing with the Nintendo 64.
9194000	9202000	I got mine in April of 1997 because I came into a little bit of money,
9202000	9209000	and when I got that money, the first thing I got was the Nintendo 64,
9209000	9213000	because up until that point, I had been a Nintendo fanboy in hell.
9213000	9220000	I have nothing against the system, and Nintendo as a whole, great company and all that,
9220000	9228000	but if I were to be nitpicky at all, it's the fact that during the system's lifespan,
9228000	9234000	the really top-notch quality games were very slow to trickle out,
9234000	9242000	and not only that, but if you compare the multiplatform games at the time,
9242000	9250000	the N64 games were considerably more expensive than, say, the PlayStation 1 versions.
9250000	9255000	Right, with the cartridge versus disc was a huge thing that kind of came up years later,
9255000	9260000	may have been a misstep for Nintendo, but some still swear by the Nintendo 64, so eh.
9260000	9264000	What about, Ray Jander, if I were to flip this question on you, what would have been your answer?
9265000	9275000	Well, I'm not really answering the question outright, but in fact I'll change up the question a little bit.
9275000	9278000	How dare you answer the question?
9278000	9287000	Well, there's one thing that I kind of regret not buying. It was the Sega Saturn.
9287000	9298000	If only because, you know, at the same time I was buying the N64, and like two weeks later I got the PlayStation 1.
9298000	9311000	I also saw the Sega Saturn at a kiosk at what was my local Toys R Us, and they were showing off Panzer Dragoon.
9311000	9319000	I thought, oh my god, this game is gorgeous. I can only afford two systems. I already got the N64.
9319000	9326000	Do I get the PlayStation 1 or do I get the Saturn? Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
9326000	9330000	So we all slept on Sega is the moral of the story.
9330000	9332000	Basically, yeah.
9332000	9335000	All right. Ray Jander, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you.
9335000	9337000	All right, have a good one.
9337000	9339000	Take care, my friend. Bye bye.
9339000	9342000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to get through.
9342000	9345000	Tell us about how you misunderstood Sega or yell at it.
9345000	9350000	As a Sega fanboy, here's your opportunity to call in and say, god damn you all, I was right this whole time.
9350000	9353000	And be the gaming hipster you know you want to be.
9353000	9355000	Loki, any last minute stories we're going to get to?
9355000	9361000	Yeah, let's talk about the whole PlayStation live streaming.
9361000	9367000	So live from PlayStation, they have a big source where you can view different game shares and stuff like that.
9367000	9374000	Also pornography, because apparently people are somehow getting pornography into that live from PlayStation.
9374000	9378000	Wait, wait, wait, wait. I remember when the system was first out it had this problem because...
9378000	9383000	No, but this is different though. This isn't people filming themselves in front of the PlayStation.
9383000	9388000	I miss the days of playroom streams and the random fucking shit that would happen.
9388000	9395000	It's not that, which is weird because they did have where you could film your own talk shows and stuff.
9395000	9400000	They have effects you could trigger through your phone. They could do that.
9400000	9403000	Well, Twitch has an IRL channel and a talk show channel.
9403000	9408000	If we wanted to do this show on Twitch, we could do that very easily.
9408000	9411000	But no, this is somehow, and I don't understand how they're doing it though,
9411000	9415000	because it shows a picture of Mafia 3. This is the game where it's from.
9415000	9419000	But then it's literally an image from the internet.
9419000	9426000	I don't know if they are playing Mafia 3 and somehow go to the internet browser and pull up porn and then do a screen share.
9426000	9429000	And then it captures it as Mafia 3 or something.
9429000	9430000	Weird.
9430000	9433000	But somehow porn is getting into there.
9433000	9442000	And the story came out because this guy, basically his kids were looking for gameplay footage from Overcooked 2.
9442000	9445000	And so they were searching for Overcooked 2 gameplay footage.
9445000	9447000	Something was definitely in the oven too long.
9447000	9449000	And then instead they got lesbian porn.
9449000	9454000	Actually that's not lesbian porn, that's just regular porn.
9454000	9457000	And naked women.
9457000	9459000	Because curation.
9459000	9460000	I see.
9460000	9461000	This is like the Steam platform.
9461000	9462000	I see.
9462000	9466000	This is the precursor of what we're going to expect in Steam.
9466000	9467000	Pornography.
9467000	9472000	So that was on Sony's little thing.
9473000	9475000	And Sony's like, they're live from Playstation.
9475000	9477000	It's basically the sharing.
9477000	9479000	You know how you can see the Playstation share feeds or whatever.
9479000	9481000	I wonder how they did that where they got the screen.
9481000	9485000	Because you can only get listed in that if you are streaming from your Playstation.
9485000	9488000	You can't get listed by going on Twitch and doing that.
9488000	9491000	But I guess you can post actual pictures too.
9491000	9493000	You know how you can share photos and stuff.
9493000	9496000	But it says right here, it says Mafia 3.
9496000	9498000	It says don't report, I am just trying to bring some fun.
9498000	9501000	And it's like a picture of some Playboy model.
9502000	9504000	Don't report.
9506000	9507000	I love it.
9507000	9510000	So I'm not sure how they're doing it, but it's being done.
9510000	9512000	Alright, last chance to get in you guys.
9512000	9515000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
9515000	9517000	Anything else to share with us, Loki?
9517000	9521000	Well, not yet, but there's a whole...
9521000	9528000	I don't try to get into NeoGaf drama, but there's NeoGaf drama regarding Patrick...
9528000	9530000	I thought everybody went to a new one now.
9530000	9532000	No, no, no, they're back.
9532000	9539000	But Patrick Klepek, I guess, he's a games journalist who is now coming after somebody in esports.
9539000	9543000	You know this is the end of the fucking show and we're scraping the bottom of the barrel.
9543000	9545000	This is the bottom of the barrel.
9545000	9550000	We looked through the barrel of news and we found some crap on the bottom.
9550000	9551000	Half-eaten sandwich.
9551000	9558000	So they're basically dredging up old photos from him in college where he's being very misogynistic and shit.
9558000	9560000	This is the day and age where we are now.
9560000	9566000	Where if you don't like somebody, you just dig into their social media history until you find some dirt on them and then expose it.
9566000	9570000	Maybe people should quit enabling those people.
9570000	9575000	Have you ever considered not enabling those people that like to dig back 10, 15 years?
9575000	9578000	Didn't I get into this just last week on OLR when we were talking about the OLR archive?
9578000	9579000	Yeah, I don't get it either.
9579000	9583000	I'm like, I probably said something shitty 15 years ago that I wouldn't say today.
9583000	9587000	So I'm going to just kind of put that out there now.
9587000	9594000	But the problem is though is, and we see this like even with like Disney where they fired, you know, James Gunn and stuff that companies will take this serious.
9594000	9603000	And they're thinking, well, we want them to get fired from his company because how dare you say something that we don't like you saying about somebody.
9603000	9607000	And so you should lose your job for that because I hate you.
9607000	9612000	I mean, it's stupid. It's the fuck. It's stupid.
9613000	9618000	This is close to home for something that I know a lot of people going through a situation right now.
9618000	9624000	And I'm just like, when are people going to blame these enablers, the people that enable these sick people?
9624000	9627000	It's because these people are all anonymous. It's because they're all anonymous.
9627000	9629000	Because if they were actual like people.
9629000	9632000	Stop enabling bully campaigns. Stop it.
9632000	9634000	That's all I have to say.
9634000	9639000	Let's see. Orange Laundry, all one word on Skype. Last chance to get through.
9639000	9641000	I don't know if anybody else is going to get through.
9641000	9643000	But some comments in chat at live.vognetwork.com.
9643000	9647000	SJ100Matt says, I think we would live happier lives if we stayed off social media.
9647000	9650000	True. But then it's like, but what about all the good things Twitter has done?
9650000	9655000	Which is, I say that very tongue in cheek. Like I really, really do think that Jack needs to not be in charge of Twitter anymore.
9655000	9659000	He's a bad CEO. He's bad for the company. He needs to leave Twitter.
9659000	9664000	But I'm not going to just leave Twitter without something else to fall back on.
9664000	9666000	I'm sorry. Mastodon is not that place.
9666000	9674000	Mastodon, I want to like Mastodon. It's too, it's too all over the place.
9674000	9676000	It's too hard to explain to other people.
9676000	9679000	The thing about Twitter, it's super fucking easy and you get it on your phone.
9679000	9682000	That's the thing. And I have so many great connections on Twitter.
9682000	9685000	And people that I talk to on Twitter that I like don't want to lose that.
9685000	9691000	But I've been so tempted to be like, I'm not coming back to this fucking place until you ban the Nazi accounts and you get rid of Jack.
9691000	9695000	Like, but I can't do it. There's too many people I'm too close with on Twitter.
9695000	9698000	And we have nowhere else to go.
9698000	9707000	And that's apparently I think this. So according to this thread I'm reading here, apparently their porn is a collectible in Mafia three.
9707000	9714000	I don't know if it's necessarily the image that they're showing on here, but apparently some of these Playboy images are parts.
9714000	9723000	It could be a collectible item in the game. Although what I'm seeing now, I think that's vintage Playboy, at least not Mafia three stuff.
9723000	9730000	MXC in chat says Discord is taking Twitter's place for me as a means to chat with my friends and people with similar interests.
9730000	9737000	That's a very interesting thought on that is that maybe I just need to invite all my Twitter friends into like a Discord place.
9737000	9739000	I don't know. Anyway.
9739000	9742000	All right. Well, we do have a VoG network Discord. There's lots of rad people there.
9742000	9747000	Maybe not all my Twitter people, but VoGnetwork.com slash Discord.
9747000	9750000	If you want to talk to me on Discord, that's a great place to find me.
9750000	9754000	And there's no Orange Lawn Radio channel. A lot of awesome people share stories there throughout the week.
9754000	9760000	Once in a while I'll reply. Many times I'll just respond with the Mr. Smoosh emote icon that Bobby Black Wolf put in there for me.
9760000	9767000	I think he did that. It would either have been him or Darktitsu. I'm pretty sure that's a Bobby thing where he put the Mr. Smoosh.
9767000	9771000	And so I just react to everything with Mr. Smoosh. Happy news, Mr. Smoosh. Sad news, Mr. Smoosh.
9771000	9779000	So if I react with Mr. Smoosh, you at least know that I read and I had a reaction to your story that was appropriate.
9779000	9788000	Yes, Bobby Black Wolf says I also put my Wolfie logo in there. I think it's funny because technically we have that little orange thing that my ex from 2002 made.
9788000	9792000	That little vector orange looking thing that was in the old OLR logo. Technically we have that.
9792000	9798000	And I guess we have the Xbox Live pixel art thing that you did years ago that actually was on Xbox for a short time.
9798000	9805000	You can't get it anymore, but you could get it. The little OLR logo. If you look at my gamer profile on Xbox, I'm never going to get rid of it.
9805000	9815000	So, you know, they'll have to take it from my profile. So there's that. So we do have our own little logos, but I do love that it's like, okay, we got the Bobby Black Wolf and we got Mr. Smoosh.
9815000	9819000	It's like the OLR logo. I'm actually okay with that.
9819000	9822000	I'm not saying that as a read. I'm okay with it, actually.
9822000	9824000	Oh, I should see if they have scoozy stuff on them.
9824000	9830000	Yeah, you want to buy some more ferrets? All right. That's it. We're going to be done here on the Skype line because nobody else is calling.
9830000	9835000	But you can always send us an email. Participate at Orange Launch Radio is the place to send us an email.
9835000	9840000	Hey, thanks you guys for tuning into another episode of Orange Launch Radio. We appreciate it.
9840000	9844000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.
9844000	9851000	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here, how are we to spread the word?
9851000	9854000	So definitely help us in telling a friend or two about the show.
9854000	9861000	A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this podcast would go an awful long way as well.
9861000	9867000	We really appreciate all of those. So that's going to about wrap it up, but not until I get final thoughts.
9867000	9874000	Loki, thank you for holding down the fort with me still while we feel the absence of Dark Sakura for a little bit longer here.
9874000	9881000	But it's always fun to sit here and listen to you get louder and louder over the craziest things like fruit this week and fruit raising.
9881000	9883000	Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
9884000	9893000	My final thought is I'm going to hopefully work on game development again because I stopped working on that space shooter one.
9893000	9898000	So I have like I literally have like a dozen projects that I want to work on.
9898000	9904000	And that one wasn't quite it's just too involved what I want to do with it.
9904000	9910000	And so I kind of step back from that right now because I just didn't want to do it right now.
9910000	9917000	And this is more exciting. So I'm going to go with this and we'll see. I may go back to it. I jump around.
9917000	9919000	So that's it.
9919000	9922000	All right. And my final thought tonight is, yeah.
9922000	9924000	Def is asking, is there going to be a post-show stream?
9924000	9929000	I don't I don't think there is going to be one tonight, but I'll probably get to one during the week.
9929000	9931000	I'm trying to think of like what to play on stream.
9931000	9936000	So if you guys have ideas like maybe there's just an RPG I really need to play through.
9936000	9940000	I thought about maybe restarting Kingdom Hearts and streaming some of that because, you know, Kingdom Hearts three is coming out.
9940000	9943000	And damned if I remember the old games at all.
9943000	9949000	So there's a I was like, maybe I'll just get a copy of the Kingdom Hearts redo and play through some of that.
9949000	9952000	I need to play through the whole thing, but I don't have that kind of time to set aside to.
9952000	9960000	Yeah, I do want to play Skyrim completely modded the fuck out and broken.
9960000	9962000	But I think people have done that. And that's kind of I don't know.
9962000	9964000	I don't know what people would want to watch me play.
9964000	9969000	And it's also hard because I don't really have a place that I can record like that for.
9969000	9973000	Well, one, my game recording hardware.
9973000	9978000	Somebody has I think I think Jamie has it now.
9978000	9980000	Jamie has it now. OK, well, Jamie.
9980000	9982000	Where's the Flaco Flaco had it.
9982000	9985000	I don't know if Jamie has it now. Somebody has it.
9985000	9987000	Somebody has it. It's I hate to say it, though.
9988000	9993000	But at this point, it's kind of dated technology because the lag is going to be really big on that.
9993000	9998000	That's the only problem. So at this point, you might want to just write off your loss and get something that's a little more like current.
9998000	10002000	Yeah, I wasn't expensive about that. Like, yeah. Years ago. Yeah.
10002000	10007000	So but I don't have the setup and I don't have like I'd have to go out into the garage and do it.
