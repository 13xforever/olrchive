This is just one story on tonight's show. Join us for more on this and the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:45.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 742. For this, August 19th of 2018.

00:46.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm Rob Roberts joined here in studio, studio N7 in Sacramento, California with my co-host, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Hello.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Hi, how are you, Loki?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Good.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Good. You had a good week?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Yeah, it was alright.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Yeah, it was okay? Just okay? Just alright?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
It was just alright, yes.

01:01.000 --> 01:14.000
Okay, that's good. I had a pretty good weekend. Well, I had like some good stuff and some not so good stuff. So I went to San Francisco and I went to a concert. So probably nobody's ever heard of this artist but her name is Joanna Lee.

01:14.000 --> 01:27.000
And she used to have like a band project called I Am Emma Who Am I? So maybe like two people out there have heard of this. So I went and saw the concert. It was great because I never like, you know, she's Swedish and probably doesn't, I think it's the first time she's ever toured in San Francisco.

01:27.000 --> 01:38.000
I just on a whim found out about this concert. Like Spotify does like the whole like, hey, you listen to this artist a lot. You might want to know that they're coming to town. So I was like, bless you Spotify. Yes, I would like to know that.

01:38.000 --> 01:50.000
So we bought tickets last week. We went and had a good time at the show, got to see our pal JD, stayed with him. Unfortunately, the next day coming home, oh boy, like traffic was terrible.

01:51.000 --> 02:04.000
I took the wrong on-ramp onto the freeway because I was trying to like listen to Waze and stuff. You know how like Waze will sometimes be like in 1000 feet, take the on-ramp on the right. And it's like, I'm not exactly sure how far 1000 feet is, but I see an on-ramp right there.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Oh, that's the wrong on-ramp. Oh, great. Oh, it's bumper to bumper.

02:08.000 --> 02:16.000
I installed Waze this week and then I looked at it and I'm like, no, no, I don't want this. And then I immediately uninstalled it.

02:16.000 --> 02:28.000
There's some things I really like about Waze like the traffic updates, but some other people I know swear by the Google, which is weird that they're separate apps because my understanding is Google bought Waze, but Google has their own navigation app.

02:28.000 --> 02:40.000
And the pros on that app is that it tells you like, get in the farthest right hand lane to make a left turn. Like it'll tell you what like lane to be in so that you can make your transitions easier. And I think that's great.

02:41.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah. And I do like that. And it does give me traffic updates and stuff like that. So that's nice. But I wanted something that most of the navigation apps, they will say, OK, take this street. It's always the main streets.

02:52.000 --> 03:06.000
I'm like, there's traffic here. I want you to reroute me through the fucking neighborhoods if it's faster. And they don't do that. They just say, oh, sit in traffic and like, well, if I just go this way, which I know is faster, I'm going to be ahead of the traffic.

03:06.000 --> 03:15.000
And yeah, I want and that's why I thought Waze was. I thought Waze was, oh, OK, this might be a little bit different where it's going to be a little bit more, you know, crowd sourced or whatever.

03:15.000 --> 03:25.000
It is crowd sourced. It's it's it's hit and miss because sometimes the problem is it'll put you on the back roads because it knows that, you know, the freeway is crowded or whatever.

03:25.000 --> 03:32.000
But then what the problem is, is it hasn't accurately measured all the traffic on the back roads yet. So you're stuck in traffic on the back roads. So it's like that's the.

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
But then, you know, it's like traffic is screwed up everywhere. What can you do? So but anyway, then so not just it was traffic.

03:40.000 --> 03:50.000
Then we stop at a Starbucks and they like completely forgot to like make my drink, even though which is funny because Alan ordered two drinks and the sticker on his drink says drink two of two.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
And it's like, OK, where did the sticker go? The machine prints out like, how did this happen?

03:55.000 --> 04:07.000
So it was just kind of one of those because I wanted to get home in time to do to get to a meeting for the Rocky Horror Crowd because there's a show next week and I like to get everybody's stage names and get everything prepped for that in advance.

04:07.000 --> 04:14.000
So I ended up being super late to that. And so and then I get home and I find out, oh, I left one of my two cell phones in San Francisco. Great.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
Yes, I have more than one cell phone. And of course, the one I left behind is the one I really need Monday to Friday.

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
So I'm just I'm just going to have to suck it up and not have it on Monday while it gets FedEx to me. And then I got to eat the cost that FedEx.

04:27.000 --> 04:37.000
So it's like I did not have the best like resolution to the weekend, but at least I'm home, at least I'm healthy, at least I got to see an artist I really like in concert.

04:37.000 --> 04:46.000
And I had got Alan and I hadn't been out to like a concert date in a long time. You know, I think the last band we saw live was erasure in the 80s.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
No, I'm just kidding. It was but it was erasure, which, of course, was a big synth pop band in the 80s and 90s.

04:51.000 --> 05:04.000
The last band that I saw live was it. And I know I don't think it was there was a tour that I saw one time, too.

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
I think the last band I saw live was Third Eye Blind. Oh, my gosh. Was that like in the 90s?

05:10.000 --> 05:19.000
No, it wasn't in the 90s. It was actually 2000s. It was one of those one of these things where my work used to raffle off tickets for like because they had box seats or whatever.

05:19.000 --> 05:28.000
And so it was just like, here you got picked. You know, I didn't even enter. It's like, here you got picked. I'm like, all right.

05:28.000 --> 05:35.000
OK, they're really blind. Yeah, that's cool. Have I ever told this story? I swear it's a video game podcast. We'll get there eventually.

05:35.000 --> 05:42.000
Have I ever told the story on OLR about the time I won backstage passes to meet Matchbox 20 in like 1997 or something?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
That's hilarious.

05:43.000 --> 05:51.000
Oh, yeah. No, I won tickets. Like, I legit won a radio contest, ironically enough. I won one of those. Like, be the 15th caller.

05:51.000 --> 05:59.000
Who knew that stuff was real? I called and I won and I got tickets and backstage passes to see Matchbox 20 and I got to meet them.

05:59.000 --> 06:09.000
This is like in 1987. And I took one of my lady friends who was like, you know, because, you know, sometimes, especially like in the teenage years, even the early 20s and stuff.

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
And heck, gosh, I know women in their 40s that still get excited when Backstreet Boys goes on tour. But hey, I get excited when Spice Girls go on tour and I wish they would again.

06:16.000 --> 06:24.000
So I get it. But yeah, so I took one of my lady friends who was like really into the band and she was like shaking and crying and doing that whole thing.

06:24.000 --> 06:31.000
So it was really it was fun. It was a lot of fun. And then leaving the concert, I got into my first automobile accident that totaled my first car.

06:31.000 --> 06:37.000
How's that for a happy ending to that story? So, gosh, concerts seem to be bad. Like, I'll have a really good time with the concert.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
And then, like, I have these really horrible resolutions to this story, so maybe I shouldn't go to any more concerts.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
Yeah, we didn't have anything bad happen at Third Eye Blind. The only thing that was bad was Third Eye Blind.

06:48.000 --> 06:55.000
Actually, no, they're great. I mean, they're fine. No issues with them. It's better than like...

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
It was a lovely time, I'm sure.

06:57.000 --> 07:06.000
I know there was one time I went to a country music concert, too. I don't even remember who it was. That's how memorable it was because I just didn't give a shit anymore.

07:06.000 --> 07:15.000
But why did I even go to that? I think that was with my parents. That must have been with my parents. I got dragged along to something because I would have never voluntarily gone to...

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
I don't even remember who it was. I just remember country music.

07:18.000 --> 07:27.000
I would say the most, like, randomly, awesomely obscure concert that I ever went to that, like, not many people can probably say they've seen live.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
This is my music hipster thing. But I went to a radio festival one year. This is around the same year, Smashbox 20 stuff.

07:32.000 --> 07:38.000
Get this. The band that was playing that I couldn't wait to see was the Vengaboys. You remember the Vengaboys?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Yes.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Come on. Those of you that listen to...

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
It's all Eurodance. That's what we used to enjoy.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
If y'all played DDR, you know the Vengaboys, because I'm really surprised that music was never in DDR.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
Or I think it was in the Europe dancing stage or whatever. But anyway, it doesn't matter.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
Captain Jack and stuff, that's all Eurodance.

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
They had a live concert here in Sacramento as part of a big radio festival with like...

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
Who else was there? It was one of the new kids on the block, like Jordan Knight or one of them.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
And Shaggy. You remember Shaggy?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Yes.

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
That was a good time. I think the Vengaboys maybe ever only played like three shows in the United States, and that was one of them.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
So that's my little, like, randomly awesome obscure story.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
Alright, going to our chat. I do want to introduce our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
vognetwork.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
And Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers, she is on a little break from the show.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
We talked about this last week if you want to hear all the details about that.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
But of course, she will be here during the middle part of the show to talk about the classic game of the week.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
But we talked a little bit about that last week, so she'll be gone for a few months.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
I guess I have to kind of say at the start of every show, you know, Jamie's not here because her name's in the intro.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
She's not here, so it's going to be that way, sadly, for a little bit.

08:59.000 --> 09:07.000
But she will be here some shows. I think she's making plans to be here, not this month, but the end, maybe one other show in September.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I don't know. We'll figure out the dates a little later.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
But I want to get to you guys in chat.

09:11.000 --> 09:19.000
And Bobby Black Wolf in chat starting us off saying, targeted advertising works, talking about the alert that I saw for I am, am I, who am I.

09:19.000 --> 09:25.000
Yeah, I don't mind being advertised to when it's stuff like that, when it's like, did you know about this?

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
And it's actually something like I really do want to know about.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
Like, sometimes I'll be on Facebook and it's like, did you know about the Underwear of the Month Club?

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
And I'm like, I don't, whatever. But like, this was something.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
Oh, I had one of those last night. Like, they're random. Like, I don't know what it is.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
Half of them, usually it's like from Wish or something. It's like, who would wish for this?

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
Some of those guys are big podcast sponsors, so I'm not going to name them because they're not sponsoring this show.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
So as far as I'm concerned, you can go get Fruit of the Loom because they're not sponsoring this show.

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
I don't remember who it was, but it was like, I saw, like the first picture was like, it was this giant bunk bed thing and it was enormous.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
Like, I'm like, if I put that in my son's room, that's just going to take up like literally the whole room. That's ridiculous.

10:05.000 --> 10:12.000
But then I scrolled to the site and they have like different duvets and stuff and they had one that looked like somebody got murdered on this.

10:12.000 --> 10:21.000
It's like, why would you put that in your room? It's like blood stains everywhere. I'm like, why would you do that?

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
Why was the purpose of this? Is that the same website that has the crack pipes for sale?

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
Maybe. I don't know. But like it was just, it was on the ad. I'm like, this is the most random stupid thing I've ever seen.

10:31.000 --> 10:37.000
Okay. Other comments from chat. Bobby Bleckle says, I love Waze. There you go.

10:37.000 --> 10:44.000
Raginator says, I've heard of ABBA, Ace of Base and Roxette, but not that Swedish artist that you mentioned that you named.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Well, now you have another one to go look up a little more, a little more modern.

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
But those are all good bands that you named Raginator. It's very, very well done. It was good.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
Let's see. Go into some other comments in chat at live.vognetwork.com.

10:57.000 --> 11:03.000
Let's see. MegamanX400 says, the last concert I saw was Britney in Vegas.

11:03.000 --> 11:11.000
Okay. First off, I'm jealous. But second off, is that really a concert or is that a performance?

11:11.000 --> 11:19.000
Like, Loki, if I were to go see a street mime perform, is that a concert or is that a performance?

11:19.000 --> 11:26.000
Because we all know Britney ain't singing, you guys. She's, she's pantomiming her way through that with elaborate,

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
but obviously any, anybody who buys a ticket to Britney full on knows that and is completely okay with that fact.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
I'm sure she's more entertaining than a mime. So, you know, that's true. She is more entertaining.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
I would rather stare at her for two hours than a mime, so.

11:41.000 --> 11:47.000
Let's see. SG100Matt says, you went to MAGFest concerts and nothing bad happened. There's something.

11:47.000 --> 11:52.000
The bad thing that happened is that I haven't been back in a long time. That's the sad thing.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
Let's see. And some folks talking about Vengaboys and a dancing stage and all this stuff.

11:57.000 --> 12:03.000
Kaijuto asking, is Dark Soccer on maternity leave? No. No, it's a, it's a work conflict.

12:03.000 --> 12:09.000
We, we got into it last week. Sadly, it's a work conflict. And somebody else explained that in chat at live.vognetwork.com.

12:09.000 --> 12:17.000
Let's see. Oh, oh, here's a random concert answer for you guys. Fifth Dream in chat says, speaking of lip syncing,

12:17.000 --> 12:26.000
I saw Milli Vanilli live. No lie. Wow. That's, you win, sir. You win. That's, that's a hell of a thing to see live.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
Talk about pantomiming. That's, that's amazing. What if the twist was that Milli Vanilli really did sing live?

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
What if like that was the twist? I don't know. Anyway. All right. We got to get into some video games.

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic. So this is a big piece of gaming news a lot of people are talking about this week.

12:41.000 --> 12:47.000
And that is that Diablo three has been confirmed for the switch. Have you been reading about this, Logie?

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
I saw the video. You did? That looked weird. Like it, like it sounded like it leaked out and then. Okay.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
So they had to release the thing. Like it's supposed to be part of a direct or something.

12:57.000 --> 13:03.000
Yeah. Okay. So here's the thing is that the information was published early on a website.

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
I believe it was Forbes publishes, which I thought Forbes was all the blogs. I didn't think they did news.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
Or am I mixing it up with another website? Starts with F. I don't know. Anyway, so whatever.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
So somehow they had the information and this has happened before.

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
We have seen big websites that had information that was under embargo. But, you know,

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
sometimes they will set the posting time and date and it gets set wrong.

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
Computer error happens. So for whatever reason, it publishes and the minute it hits the Internet, y'all.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
It's done. It's out there. That's why these websites have to be careful.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
So I'm sure Forbes got a little bit of a nasty gram from Nintendo and Blizzard.

13:38.000 --> 13:44.000
But at the same time, this shit happens. Like, you know, it's you know, things are going to leak out.

13:44.000 --> 13:50.000
Also, I mean, it was this Diablo three on Switch thing's been going around for a long time.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
We talked about last week. Yeah, I think I really think we did.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
So it's just you finally had the confirmation. And what really sold it was that they had screen shots posted.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
Like there were screen shots of like Ganon armor and like Zelda related things in the game.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
And they were on Forbes. So it wasn't like somebody's like Tumblr fan art or something like that.

14:09.000 --> 14:15.000
It was which again. But but does doesn't Forbes sometimes publish Tumblr fan art?

14:15.000 --> 14:22.000
I don't know. Anyway. So anyhow, maybe they said so then all these other websites start posting things that say,

14:22.000 --> 14:31.000
well, Forbes, and with no bitterness at all, Forbes has announced early there's a leak, you know, that Diablo three is happening.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
And so we all know it's happening. The next day, it's confirmed.

14:35.000 --> 14:42.000
And they put out this video that shows Reggie Fils-Aime calling Mike Morhaime from Blizzard.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
And they're kind of talking and have a little bit of banner. And then they kind of get into the game.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
But here's the OK. So here's the thing about the trailer. And I talked about this a little bit on Twitter.

14:50.000 --> 14:58.000
That little video that they did was cut really weird. Like it was really hastily edited for me.

14:58.000 --> 15:05.000
And like there's a lot of other things that didn't add up to me. For example, there's this running gag with the light switch.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
Like Reggie Fils-Aime goes, what's that? What's what? The lights are flickering. What's that all about?

15:09.000 --> 15:16.000
And I don't know. Some people theorized it was because, well, you know, back in February,

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
the official Diablo Twitter posted a picture of a light switch.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
And that's where all these Diablo three on switch rumors started to begin with.

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
And I'm like, OK, that's a little bit of a stretch to have Reggie Fils-Aime act.

15:29.000 --> 15:36.000
That's a little bit of a stretch. I mean, I realize Reggie Fils-Aime has kind of become a meme king in some.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
But that meme, that's a little bit of a stretch. I don't know about that one.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
He hasn't been put in the smash yet. That would make him the meme king.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
You know, wait for it. I'm waiting for it.

15:46.000 --> 15:53.000
Let me ask. OK. OK, I'll ask this now. We get on Tantra sometimes. It happens. I'll come back to this direct thing in a minute.

15:53.000 --> 16:05.000
Would it be in good taste or would it be in bad taste to put the former CEO of Nintendo in the game?

16:05.000 --> 16:13.000
Would that be in good taste, a tribute, or would that be in bad taste because he passed?

16:13.000 --> 16:19.000
Just I don't know. I know. Right. Tricky, tricky moral quandary.

16:19.000 --> 16:25.000
Is it a tribute or is it an insult? Just put him in the alleged rumored mode that there may be.

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
Just kind of curious. Here he is. All right.

16:30.000 --> 16:36.000
OK, so anyway, back to the back to the issue at hand. So so we were talking about the trailer.

16:36.000 --> 16:43.000
OK, so not only that, but then towards the end of the thing, when they were transitioning into the full Diablo three trailer, the light switch does a weird thing.

16:43.000 --> 16:49.000
Again, you hear this growl, but they show like the Diablo three stock photo and it does this really weird pan.

16:49.000 --> 16:55.000
It's just edited really weird. And then it's like that they were talking about their online service.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
Yeah, like cut all the information about their online service.

16:58.000 --> 17:05.000
So and then Mike Morehame and Reggie are talking and they say, let's patch in the fans and they do this weird transition.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
And that to me was the like one of the oddest things in the whole thing was like, what do you mean?

17:09.000 --> 17:16.000
Let's patch in the fans like that's a weird like I get that they had this whole like set up like they were doing a fakie online call and stuff.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
It was just I don't know. Like, why do you go out of your way to drop a line like that?

17:21.000 --> 17:27.000
It seems like like a line like that. Believe me, when you have these Nintendo directs and stuff, everything is scripted.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
Everything is down to the letter branding, branding, branding. There's no improv in any of this stuff.

17:32.000 --> 17:39.000
This is why Nintendo switched to directs and doesn't do the live stuff anymore so that they can control everything.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
Right. So although I guess they did do a live review over the switch, so it's not 100 percent right.

17:44.000 --> 17:53.000
But anyway, my point is that video really felt like it was clipped out of a larger Nintendo direct about something else, namely online play.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
Now, here's the complication, though, that's come up since I wrote all those tweets.

17:57.000 --> 18:03.000
And actually, when Bobby talked about on his show, I didn't didn't didn't know this part because I hadn't said anything about it yet.

18:03.000 --> 18:19.000
So here's the other thing. Folks are saying on Twitter, including Kotaku in their news article, including some rumbles around like, you know, Blizzard and all that stuff is that the information was supposed to be released the next day.

18:19.000 --> 18:26.000
So the day they actually unveiled it was always going to be the day that they officially announced Diablo three on switch.

18:26.000 --> 18:32.000
And I think Gamescom has something to do with that because it is going to be playable at Gamescom.

18:32.000 --> 18:37.000
So it was always meant to be that day. But I don't know, y'all.

18:37.000 --> 18:45.000
Like, it's not that I don't believe that it wasn't meant to be announced that day, especially if Blizzard did want to take it to Gamescom and they did want to show it off and all this stuff.

18:45.000 --> 18:53.000
But that doesn't still change my opinion that that little trailer that we got, that video that we got feels like a piece of something else.

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
And maybe there will be a Nintendo direct and we're going to see that exact same clip, but inserted in a Nintendo direct.

18:59.000 --> 19:05.000
And I know this is very tinfoil hatty type of thing, but I mean, on the other hand, it totally makes sense.

19:05.000 --> 19:14.000
If you're going to do a Nintendo direct that's focused on online and why your fans should pay this money to have an online service,

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
because you know there's people complaining out there right now.

19:17.000 --> 19:22.000
Why do I have to pay for something that you're already doing for free? This is double dipping.

19:22.000 --> 19:28.000
You guys have all heard it. Y'all know it's out there. Whether you feel the same or you feel different, you know this is out there right now.

19:28.000 --> 19:33.000
So Nintendo's going to do a direct to try to justify to people why they're going to pay that amount.

19:33.000 --> 19:43.000
So I mean, you know, didn't this kind of feel like it doesn't a Diablo 3 play with your friends online announcement really feel like something that would have been a logical part of a direct like that?

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Yes, it really does. Yeah, it does.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
So are they doing anything during E3 or not E3 Gamescom?

19:49.000 --> 19:58.000
Blizzard is Nintendo, I don't think they have anything official?

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
They may have a booth, but I don't think there's any like planned announcements or anything.

20:04.000 --> 20:11.000
But to be fair, they don't really do all they do. They do an E3 direct, but they're not doing anything at E3 besides a booth.

20:11.000 --> 20:16.000
Well, I take that back because they have their Smash tournaments now. They brought back Nintendo World Championships.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
So I guess they do have any sort of direct announced or anything.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
So not yet, but lately when they...

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
How long are we going to wait for this online service direct? I mean, come on, like seriously.

20:26.000 --> 20:33.000
Nintendo has never, well, I shouldn't say never, but in the past couple of years, as far back as I can remember, which in internet time is not a very long time.

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
Nintendo has never given you three weeks notice on a direct. They've never done that.

20:39.000 --> 20:48.000
As far back as my memory goes, what they do, they say, tomorrow, Nintendo Direct 4 p.m. be there and people will be there.

20:48.000 --> 20:54.000
So they're not going to announce it until the day before because they never do. Like this is just how they roll now.

20:54.000 --> 21:03.000
They need to talk about what's in their online service because they're already taking pre-orders for their online service. So I think that's fair.

21:04.000 --> 21:13.000
Mega Man X400 in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Nintendo is really dragging their feet on announcing this online. What is the holdup at this point?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Are they worried someone's going to steal their idea?

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
You guys, you just want to get pieces of this online business as well.

21:23.000 --> 21:30.000
See, here's the thing. They've kind of officially announced it though. And there's been a social media push this week to really show like here's all the stuff you can expect.

21:31.000 --> 21:39.000
But I think where people feel like Nintendo hasn't really announced it, even though they've tweeted about it, they've posted on Facebook, they say this is coming.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
They haven't told you all the games.

21:42.000 --> 21:53.000
Or what it looks like. Here's what the online service looks like. Here's Mario Brothers. And look, we're playing two layers. And here's how it looks when you connect with your friends.

21:53.000 --> 22:01.000
Here's the interface for this whole thing. Yeah, Nintendo has not really peeled back the curtain on the intricacies, the user's manual on how this is all going to work.

22:01.000 --> 22:07.000
And what is unfortunately happening, and this has been happening for a long time, is that people are filling in the gaps.

22:07.000 --> 22:14.000
You know, people are saying, oh, well, Nintendo is waiting to show their online system so that they can show us how the achievement system works.

22:14.000 --> 22:24.000
There's not going to be an achievement system. Nintendo has watched me eat those words later, but whatever. I'll own it if I have to.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Does it matter at this point?

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
Yeah, it doesn't matter at this point. It's gone this long.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
It's like so late to the game.

22:29.000 --> 22:37.000
Yeah. People feel like, even though Nintendo's kind of announced some stuff online, they haven't gone over it with a fine-tooth comb.

22:37.000 --> 22:50.000
They have not explained it in the Smash Brothers Direct level of detail where they're like, we took the number of frames in this person's B button move and we've reduced it.

22:50.000 --> 22:58.000
The Smash Brothers Directs get really in-depth. Really in-depth so people know what to expect. And we haven't kind of had that yet. I don't know.

22:58.000 --> 23:11.000
Anyway. Let's see. Going to chat at live.vognetwork.com. S2100matt talking about the Diablo 3 trailer says, from an editing standpoint, I believe it's part of a grander Direct because it's awkward thematically.

23:11.000 --> 23:20.000
My guess is the lights could be a running gag in the Direct. I get the sense this was done recently and still being worked on. Thanks, Forbes. Which is why those transitions seem off.

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
Yeah, just something doesn't add up about that whole video. I don't know.

23:24.000 --> 23:40.000
Anyway. Let's see. Other comments in chat at live.vognetwork.com. HaloAddictMan, who I think is BreakMan in chat, says, if you are expecting Nintendo to suddenly give you Sony Online quality, that's on you, not them.

23:41.000 --> 23:49.000
TigerClaw in chat says, watch. Nintendo will force players to pay for Nintendo's Online service just to play the new Smash Brothers Online against other players.

23:49.000 --> 24:02.000
That is happening. And to be fair to Nintendo, they are giving ample warning on that. Even if you look at the box for things like Splatoon, it's in tiny print.

24:02.000 --> 24:13.000
But it says, online play available, paid online will be required with the start of Nintendo's Online service in, I think at that time it was still summer of 2018.

24:13.000 --> 24:26.000
So honestly guys, these last few months have been a gift. Because Nintendo's Online service was supposed to be like a year ago. So all this free Splatooning you guys have been doing has been a gift.

24:26.000 --> 24:39.000
So, yeah. I mean, I don't think you could accurately accuse Nintendo of blindsiding us with this. They have been stating this on their games. Go look at the game boxes of what you're buying.

24:39.000 --> 24:50.000
Even the fine print that you probably scroll through real quick on the digital purchases that you buy. It says something about Nintendo's Online services being required as of probably an earlier date than now.

24:50.000 --> 25:02.000
But Nintendo can say, oh well, we told you it was going to be earlier. We're waiving the fee for the whatever lovey-dovey thing they want to say to kind of ease that over a little bit.

25:02.000 --> 25:14.000
So, anything. Anyway. Now, one other thing I want to get into with this deal. Because this Diablo thing, even though it's something that's been rumored for a long time, it's got all these interesting elements to it.

25:14.000 --> 25:34.000
Like, the timing of the announcement. Is it a part of Nintendo's bigger Online strategy? And then there's this other part about it where now that you have Blizzard putting Diablo 3 on a Nintendo console, which is the first time Blizzard's done something with a Nintendo console since, what, like Lost Vikings on Super Nintendo?

25:35.000 --> 25:49.000
Did they do anything on Nintendo 64? I don't... Yeah, but you'd have to go way back. You'd have to go way back. Like, at least 20 years. You'd have to go back to find the last time Blizzard... And they were probably still, what was it, Synapse and whatever their old name was.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Starcraft was on 64, according to chat.

25:51.000 --> 25:59.000
Oh, that's right! There was a Starcraft 64. Thank you guys. And they were working on Starcraft... No, Starcraft Ghost was a PS2 thing, I think. Anyway.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
You're right. Starcraft was on N64. That was probably the last time Blizzard did something on a console.

26:03.000 --> 26:17.000
So now people are asking, you know, and this is not something that is unheard of, well, if Blizzard is now doing stuff on Nintendo again, where is Hearthstone? Where is Overwatch?

26:18.000 --> 26:33.000
An interesting comment on all of this, though, is that, I guess they've actually, Blizzard has kind of, like, talked about this a little bit, saying that, well, Overwatch is feasible, but Starcraft 2 is going to be difficult on the Switch.

26:33.000 --> 26:42.000
But that's interesting. So, it was an interview with GameSpot, with senior producer at Blizzard, Pete Stillwell, where he said,

26:42.000 --> 26:52.000
Anything is within the realm of possibility. Our team was given the task to work on this, Diablo 3. If Team 4, the Overwatch developer, picks up that endeavor, that's on them.

26:52.000 --> 27:04.000
As of right now, Diablo is our only focus on Switch. Yes, it is feasible. So this has all of the Overwatch fans and all the Nintendo Switch owners doing that whole Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber.

27:04.000 --> 27:11.000
So you're saying there's a chance. Am I right? That's what everybody's doing. So you're saying there's a chance.

27:11.000 --> 27:23.000
Because all they have to do is port the console version over. They don't have to rebuild it to work with the Switch. Whereas a game like Starcraft, which is not built for a console system, they would have to retool that.

27:23.000 --> 27:38.000
Even though you just said the original was on Nintendo 64. Dude, and how well did it play? And how well did it play? It was so great. Just like Command and Conquer Red Alert was on PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 1, and that was so fucking awesome.

27:38.000 --> 27:49.000
That's my favorite version of the game. To be fair, the same senior producer had something to say about that. The N64 version of Starcraft was cool, but you had to change the game quite a bit to make it work properly on console.

27:49.000 --> 27:58.000
Starcraft 2 is next level requirements for how much dexterity you need with a mouse and keyboard, so I think that would have been a very difficult port. It would have to change the core gameplay.

27:58.000 --> 28:09.000
So when it comes to Starcraft, I'm not hearing there's a chance at all. That's not gonna happen. But it's interesting that the door got left open to crack on Overwatch and now everybody's screaming and hooping and hollering about it.

28:09.000 --> 28:23.000
What about World of Warcraft? On the Switch, though? I just don't think that's the game to put on the Switch. I don't know. But then again, Final Fantasy XIV is great on PlayStation 4.

28:23.000 --> 28:40.000
Put that on the Switch. I would go for that. But the problem is, this is where you get into a weird area with Final Fantasy XIV specifically. Final Fantasy XIV went out of their way to announce to the fanbase and brace themselves,

28:40.000 --> 28:53.000
we are ending PlayStation 3 support. And they already did that last year when they released Stormblood. They ended PlayStation 3 support. And the reason why they did it was that they wanted to push the graphics, they wanted to push everything to the next level.

28:53.000 --> 29:04.000
Yeah, the 3 would no longer support it. So everything is on the PlayStation 4 or PC. So the problem is, if you now introduce the Switch into it, well the Switch is not quite as powerful as a PlayStation 4.

29:05.000 --> 29:16.000
So even though it's way more powerful than PlayStation 3, you're going to have to probably lower the bar to get the Switch owners in. So I just don't think Final Fantasy XIV is going to happen on Switch for that reason.

29:16.000 --> 29:34.000
Unless, in a couple of years, we get a Switch DX. Because you know Nintendo will do it. Why not? They've done it with Game Boys. They've done it with other stuff. Why not repackage the Switch and give it a deluxe version with some extra oomph in it?

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
Because they didn't do that with their last few console systems.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
Well, but the Switch is no longer just a console.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
It's not like a handheld system though. I don't think they will.

29:43.000 --> 29:53.000
Depends on your experience. DungeonBuster though points out Wolfenstein 2 and Doom are graphically demanding, but they managed to get it on the Switch. So who knows?

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
Yeah, but the only, well yeah, I guess.

29:56.000 --> 30:04.000
S2100Matt points out Crossplay would be nice for Overwatch. That would be pretty awesome if they said, you know, that would be an interesting little alliance.

30:04.000 --> 30:15.000
If Nintendo, they came out and said, Overwatch is coming out on the Switch and you can play with your friends on Xbox One. Thanks to a special agreement between us and Microsoft.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
But fuck you Sony, because there ain't no agreement there.

30:18.000 --> 30:24.000
Well, but you know what's going to happen is, oh well we invited Sony, but they didn't want to. You know that'll happen.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
Well fuck them. I mean, they don't want to come to the table. I'm telling you.

30:27.000 --> 30:39.000
But the weird thing when it comes to Overwatch specifically and the whole online is that Blizzard is the one keeping Crossplay out between PC and console.

30:39.000 --> 30:44.000
Because I'm positive Microsoft would have no problem doing PC and Xbox. They have no problem with that.

30:45.000 --> 30:55.000
But Blizzard wants that separated because of keyboard and mouse versus controller to the extent that like things on console are balanced differently.

30:55.000 --> 31:09.000
Like Torbjorn's turrets, Symmetra's turrets, don't function the same way on, well they function the same way, they're not as powerful on console because of the whole keyboard and mouse versus, you know, controller thing.

31:09.000 --> 31:15.000
So, Blizzard made the very distinct, you can't blame Sony for that one I suppose.

31:15.000 --> 31:23.000
Now, I don't know if Blizzard has commented on why Crossplay is not available between PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

31:23.000 --> 31:31.000
I think most people have kind of not pushed the issue because we sort of, why would we suddenly expect a game on Sony and Microsoft to be Crossplayable?

31:31.000 --> 31:36.000
But now if you throw Nintendo into the mix, that's going to get real interesting. I don't know.

31:37.000 --> 31:48.000
Comments and chats over at live.vognetwork.com. Let's see, MegaManX400 says, I honestly believe that Overwatch is coming to Switch.

31:48.000 --> 31:54.000
They're just working out the Crossplay with Xbox and they're waiting for the next big character release.

31:54.000 --> 32:03.000
Well, my friend, there would be a really good time to announce this coming up in about two months at this little convention that Blizzard likes to hold in Anaheim.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
So, a little BlizzCon event at the beginning of November is when that is.

32:07.000 --> 32:15.000
So, I mean, if it's going to happen anytime soon, that's when they're going to peel back the curtain on it and that would be a big reveal for Overwatch.

32:15.000 --> 32:21.000
A lot of people are kind of sitting here going, what is going to be Blizzard's big reveal this year?

32:21.000 --> 32:26.000
Usually, most years, every other year at least, it's been a Warcraft expansion.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
Jetpack cat.

32:28.000 --> 32:33.000
But they just had a Warcraft expansion literally last week.

32:33.000 --> 32:39.000
So, there's not going to be a new Warcraft expansion announced. They might talk about a new patch. They're not going to talk about a new expansion.

32:39.000 --> 32:45.000
So, it's got to be something in the Starcraft universe, the Diablo universe.

32:45.000 --> 32:56.000
It could be an Overwatch on Switch. I kind of think it's a reach still, you guys, but I would not say it's impossible. We'll leave it at that.

32:56.000 --> 33:02.000
And then what else would be? Hearthstone. Now, see, that's the one that I don't get why that's not on Switch.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
Hearthstone could easily be on Switch and should be on Switch.

33:06.000 --> 33:13.000
Like, that's the one that I don't understand why Nintendo has not put that on Switch. It's on mobile phones, for heaven's sakes.

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
The Switch would let you do a lot more. You'd kind of have the best of both worlds.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
Yeah, I don't know.

33:18.000 --> 33:22.000
Yeah, that's the one that I don't understand why it's not on Switch. We'll see.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
Well, especially since they have console ports already, so why not?

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
Looking in chat, sj100matt says, yeah, Hearthstone seems like a gimme.

33:28.000 --> 33:34.000
BobbyBlackWolf says, Hearthstone should be simple. Open Unity, compile to Switch, profit. Well...

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
You know it's not that easy.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
You know it's not that easy. Let's turn up the graphics on the screen.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
But yes, it's almost that easy.

33:39.000 --> 33:44.000
It is. No, I totally get what he's saying. I don't want to dismiss that because I would say he's partially right.

33:44.000 --> 33:49.000
You know where things are going to get tricky? Online.

33:50.000 --> 33:55.000
Hearthstone lives and breathes and dies by the online play and selling the card packs.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Because Hearthstone is a free game.

33:57.000 --> 34:03.000
So Nintendo needs to be able to support that whole transaction service of the card packs and everything.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Well, they have Fortnite.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
Well, yes, Nintendo has Fortnite. Nintendo does DLC.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
So, I mean, Nintendo is going to be unveiling this online thing.

34:10.000 --> 34:19.000
But, I mean, didn't some of us kind of assume that Nintendo's poor online was what made EA say, never mind.

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
That whole thing we talked about with the Wii U? Never mind.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
Because we can't nickel and dime people with loot boxes.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
No, it's because they run everything in fucking Frostbite and Frostbite doesn't run on the Switch.

34:30.000 --> 34:35.000
That's why. Because they're fucking lazy with their one-engine franchises.

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
Kaijuto says Hearthstone is gambling so I doubt they want kids to gamble.

34:40.000 --> 34:44.000
I'm pretty sure parental controls, which I would hope to God if you're going to drop.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
Because your kid didn't drop $400 on the Switch, you did.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
I don't know if you dropped that kind of money on the Switch, you've gone in and set up parental controls.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
I mean, I don't know because I don't have kids.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
And, Loki, I don't know if your kids are old enough yet to be doing this.

34:55.000 --> 35:01.000
But, like, you know, if you give your oldest kid an iPad, does he know how to go in there and buy stuff?

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
Like, did you have to learn how to go in and shut that off so he needs a password?

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
Or he needs parental controls to be able to do that?

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
Well, I have a password on any of the purchases and there's no way he can...

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
He can't. He won't be able to type it in.

35:14.000 --> 35:21.000
Now, with Microsoft, and I think this works on, like, the Xbox too, but with Microsoft you can have family accounts.

35:21.000 --> 35:26.000
Basically, you set, like, this person's a child under your account and you can actually allocate them.

35:26.000 --> 35:31.000
Okay, you did well today, so I'm going to give you $20 in your account to go spend.

35:31.000 --> 35:37.000
And they can go spend it. Or, if they want to purchase something, they go to purchase it and it asks for permission.

35:37.000 --> 35:44.000
So, what happens is I get an email saying, Josh wants to purchase Minecraft. Do you accept or decline?

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
You know, and you can do that.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Okay. What was that on again?

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
That's on Microsoft.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Oh, okay.

35:49.000 --> 35:58.000
So, I do that with, like, Windows because when I was setting up his laptop, I had to keep going back and forth between email accounts because, you know, it's all asking permission.

35:58.000 --> 36:05.000
I'm like, fine. Yeah, but it's nice because my youngest son, you know, he doesn't understand how purchases work,

36:05.000 --> 36:12.000
and so he did go on the Switch and try to purchase skins, or maybe it was a tablet. He tried purchasing skins, but he doesn't have a password.

36:12.000 --> 36:19.000
So, he doesn't, it won't let him do it, but he, like, got stuck on a purchase screen and he's like, I don't know what I'm doing.

36:19.000 --> 36:25.000
I just wanted to pick that skin because he wanted to be the Power Ranger skin. So, he doesn't know that it costs money.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Ah, right, right.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
But, you know, it didn't let him go that far because I have passwords and everything.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
Good, good.

36:30.000 --> 36:38.000
Whereas back in the day when, like, you know, we were, I don't know about you, Loki, but in my family where I was the kid on the computer all the time,

36:38.000 --> 36:46.000
and then it was like if I want to spend the plus hours on Prodigy to use chat rooms or the World Wide Web or something, it was like, oh, it just lets me right on.

36:46.000 --> 36:51.000
My parents didn't have to give any permission, and then when the $80 bill comes from Prodigy, I get a scream.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Oh, yeah.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
We did that.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Screamed the house down with my mom.

36:55.000 --> 37:01.000
Yeah, we did that. We were posting a joke on a joke forum. It was a stupid joke, but for some reason it cost money to do that.

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
Or it was the long distance fees or something like that because there's always long distance fees.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Yeah, long distance fees.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Connect to a phone number that wasn't local.

37:08.000 --> 37:14.000
Yeah, I remember asking permission so I could call the Sierra BBS to download, like, a game demo.

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
Because the Sierra BBS was in the Bay Area somewhere, so it was long distance from here.

37:18.000 --> 37:27.000
I remember asking permission. I was like, I got a good grade in school. Can I call the Sierra BBS and spend $10 on a phone call to download some stupid demo?

37:27.000 --> 37:32.000
Can I spend $10 in long distance fees to get a free demo?

37:32.000 --> 37:39.000
Was it like the local free zine or whatever that would have the BBS numbers in the back?

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Oh, yeah.

37:40.000 --> 37:45.000
So you used to go there and pirate all the things. 56K.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Me too.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
No, I'm sorry. Back then it was 28-8.

37:48.000 --> 37:55.000
Do you know how many different BBSes I was playing? Lord of the Red or Legend of the Red Dragon or whatever that game was called?

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Never got into that.

37:56.000 --> 38:02.000
And The Pit. I had the graphical front end for The Pit. I was playing The Pit on like five different BBSes in town. It was crazy.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
Anyway, alright. We're showing our age here a little bit.

38:05.000 --> 38:10.000
Alright, let's get into away from Diablo 3 on the Switch and all that news.

38:10.000 --> 38:17.000
Because honestly, we don't know until we know and I think BlizzCon will have some more announcements and we'll just have to wait.

38:17.000 --> 38:22.000
Anyhow, in the meantime, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games we have been playing this week.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
So, Loki, how was your gaming week?

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
My week was just basically Earth Defense Force 4-1.

38:26.000 --> 38:36.000
So I went ahead and played it on PC because I've had it on PC for a while and I was researching third person shooter engine type things.

38:37.000 --> 38:42.000
That's what I say. But really, what it was is just an excuse to play it through Earth Defense Force 4.1.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
So I've been doing that and cheating the whole way.

38:44.000 --> 38:48.000
But here's the thing though. As the game is so hard, even when I'm cheating, I still die.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
And it's still incredibly hard while cheating.

38:50.000 --> 38:55.000
You would think that I set my life to unlimited, that there's no way I'm gonna die.

38:55.000 --> 39:04.000
But no, yet the game finds some fucking way to kill me when there's like literally nothing on the screen to kill me.

39:04.000 --> 39:08.000
And I don't know how the hell I died. It's just random like that.

39:08.000 --> 39:13.000
So it allows me to see what works for a third person shooter.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
It makes it fun because Earth Defense Force is fun.

39:15.000 --> 39:23.000
But yet Earth Defense Force is also frustrating because of bullshit that it pulls that just doesn't make any sense sometimes.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
So I'm taking that to note.

39:26.000 --> 39:31.000
But yeah, the game, the way it progresses is kind of weird.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
You know, it goes through the motions of like the first few games where,

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Oh, you destroyed the mothership and that's that.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
And then now there's this giant like...

39:39.000 --> 39:44.000
And I had to laugh at all of the names that like these scientists or whatever they're supposed to be studying,

39:44.000 --> 39:50.000
these Ravager aliens give to these creatures that are attacking them.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
They like give them the dumbest fucking names possible.

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
Like some of them are just so fucking weird and some of them are just like,

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
We'll call this one an Earth Eater.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
They're Earth Eaters now or this one is Retarius.

40:03.000 --> 40:07.000
Or like, it's like, who the fuck is coming up with these names?

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Just call them their fucking ants.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Call them the giant fucking ants.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Hey, there's giant fucking bees now.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
You don't need to give it like some stupid name.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
They're fucking giant bees.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Not flying insects.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Bees is not a copyrighted term.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
I can't wait to see if you ever make a shoot-em-up game, Loki.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
You're just going to call the...

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
I will. I will have dialogue like that.

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
We're going to call them ginormous monster.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Dude, they're fucking ants.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Let's just call them giant fucking ants.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
Calm down. Calm down.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
That's literally going to be dialogue if I ever did a game like that.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
So...

40:41.000 --> 40:45.000
But yeah, so it's mainly that and then of course, you know, Pokemon Go.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme, that usual stuff.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Nothing on PlayStation this week.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
I didn't actually get to mess around on the TV.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.000
But yeah, there's Earth Defense Force.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Still going to be playing through it some more.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
My gaming week.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
I hit level 39 in Pokemon Go today.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
One more level to go until max level of Pokemon Go.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
I'm 32.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
Nice.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
So here's the thing about hitting level 39.

41:10.000 --> 41:16.000
So to get from 0 to 39, you need 15 million XP, cumulative, from start to finish.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
It takes 5 million XP to get from level 39 to 40.

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
So basically, when you hit level 39, it's congratulations.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
You're three quarters of the way through the game.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
So I still have a quarter to go.

41:29.000 --> 41:36.000
So as much as it feels like, yay, I got this really high level, it's also like, ah, damn, I still have so far to go.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
But you know what? Ingress is even worse.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
It reminds me of that sequence.

41:40.000 --> 41:45.000
They have like a montage sequence in South Park where they're grinding in like the beginning area.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Yes. Yes.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
It's basically that.

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
I will say though, the friends system has been like the best thing for XP.

41:52.000 --> 41:57.000
Like even though I'm not hitting like three stars with everybody, I'm hitting two stars with a lot of people.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Because that takes seven days.

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
I try to cycle. It's really like, I'm sorry if I'm not sending you presents every day on my list.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
But it is hard to get enough.

42:05.000 --> 42:10.000
I try to at least send as much as I can, but like you get capped at opening 20 or 21 gifts.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
And it's like, I can't.

42:11.000 --> 42:18.000
Well, and even that, it's like trying to get the presents from, like I sat, you know, when I'm watching, my kids do gymnastics.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
And there's a gym there at the gymnastics place.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
And so I sit there and I'm spinning every five.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
That's why I keep getting presents.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
Yes, that's why I keep getting those.

42:28.000 --> 42:32.000
I sit there and I spin the stop every five minutes.

42:32.000 --> 42:38.000
And I'm lucky to get like three or two or three gifts during like a good hour and a half.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
So it's ridiculous.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
But I mean, that whole friend system has been good XP overall.

42:43.000 --> 42:48.000
And the ones I have, I have hit three stars with probably, oh, 13 or 14 people.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
And that's 50K every time.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
And then maybe two or three of them, I timed it right.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Like I actually thought I had to hit the lucky egg.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
So I got, you know, double XP, which works on those.

42:58.000 --> 43:04.000
So like, you know, I got some, that was probably a good million of my XP probably came from all that friend stuff.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
So I will keep working on that.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
I'm excited.

43:08.000 --> 43:13.000
Anyway, outside of that, been playing more Final Fantasy 14.

43:13.000 --> 43:18.000
I finally started the last patch's story, patch 4.3.

43:18.000 --> 43:25.000
Because some friends of mine wanted to do Sukiyomi, which is the new raid encounter.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Well, I don't know what you call it, eight man battle.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
They wanted to do that fight on EX or Extreme.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
And I was like, oh, because I haven't done the story.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
I haven't even unlocked that fight on regular yet.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Whoops, I should probably catch up.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
So I did finally play through the story.

43:38.000 --> 43:47.000
And like this last patch's story is pretty good, even though it's also really like, it's kind of like, well, not kind of, it's really dark.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
Like it's, wow, it's, it's kind of weird.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
So, but I liked it.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
So, because I like sick things.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
So yeah, that's my Final Fantasy 14 review.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
It's dark and sick, but I liked it.

43:58.000 --> 44:02.000
That was my Final Fantasy 14 experience.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
And then I've been continuing to play Heroes of the Storm.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
I've probably done my AI matches every day.

44:07.000 --> 44:13.000
I saved up 15,000 in-game gold so I could buy Whitemane, the newest character that they released.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Who's a character from World of Warcraft.

44:15.000 --> 44:22.000
She's kind of like a bad priest and anybody who's ever run Scarlet Monastery in their World of Warcraft careers knows Whitemane.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Cause she's the boss that resurrects her husband.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
A bad priest? Maybe the timing wasn't great for that one.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Loki.

44:30.000 --> 44:36.000
But anyway, she's, she's, yeah, so she's, she's a fun character to play though.

44:36.000 --> 44:41.000
So yeah, but otherwise, yeah, just been trying to finish my daily quests and all that good stuff.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
And Heroes of the Storm and a little bit of Overwatch.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
I didn't realize the consoles and everything were having a free weekend.

44:47.000 --> 44:53.000
I was playing on PC and I was like, dang, why am I getting matched with all these like really low level people?

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
And I was, oh, they're having a free weekend on PC.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
That's what's going on.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
So they've been having like this long event.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
But I was just finally like, I haven't played Overwatch in forever.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
I need to get in there and like play some Moira or something like that.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
So I did that.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
It was good.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
And that was my gaming week pretty much.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Not that exciting otherwise.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
So, all right.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
Housekeeping.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
We will not be here in two weeks.

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
Labor Day weekend will not be here as I will be at Dragon Con.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
I'm going to be a part of eight panels of Dragon Con.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
So I'll be really easy to find.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
Hopefully by the time you hear this, the Dragon Con app will be updated.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
The ETA is on the 20th.

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
And you can find me in the app Rob Roberts under the Attending Professionals.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
And you can see my schedule there.

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
And I hope to see you at one of the panels that I will be moderating or participating on.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
Please don't be shy.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Come up and say hello and introduce yourself.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
I always enjoy meeting people from the show.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
It's always a lot of fun.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
So, yeah, really looking forward to Dragon Con.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Bobby Blackwolf from Voice Geese Network will be there.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Other faces.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
I know Gary from Critical Myth will be there.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
I think Brian from British Invaders is scheduled to be there.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
So there will be some other faces.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
Travis, who used to have Understation Live, is going to be there.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
He's making his big return to Dragon Con after a couple years off.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
So really excited to see everybody.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
Yay.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
But, yeah, no podcast.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.000
As Break Man in chat says, Rob will be way too drunk to podcast.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
I don't know.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
Me and getting drunk at Dragon Con is kind of hit and miss.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
I don't remember getting super drunk last year.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
Well, wait, I take that back. One night I did.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
And really, is there too drunk to be podcasting?

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Because I think it only enhances it.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
I went to the Spectrum party, which is kind of like the LGBT party.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
And the only way I could kind of be social was to drink a lot.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Because I don't know a lot of people.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
So, anyway.

46:37.000 --> 46:42.000
But since I'm doing so many panels, I don't want to be hungover or drunk on a panel.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
That's a bad, bad mistake for Rob to make.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
So I have to be professional.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
So for that reason, I don't know if I'll be doing a ton of drinking.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
I don't know. We'll have to see. I have to see what panels I have on Sunday.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
I think I have maybe only one or two panels on Sunday.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
So we'll have to see what it is.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
But I think the Overwatch panel is Sunday.

46:57.000 --> 47:01.000
So I kind of need to be in top form for that.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
So, anyhow.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
Let's see.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
Tigerclass says, what you don't want to be drunk at is presenting an award.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
That would be bad.

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
Were we ever drunk when we did the Parsecs?

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
I don't think so.

47:15.000 --> 47:19.000
Maybe I'd had one or two drinks, but not enough to be intoxicated.

47:19.000 --> 47:25.000
And, please, since I am talking about drinking and glamorizing that, always drink responsibly.

47:25.000 --> 47:30.000
Part of the reason why I can do that at Dragon Con is because Dragon Con is all walking.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
It's all walking distance.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
And I know plenty of people that are there.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
So that's why I can be a little bit irresponsible.

47:35.000 --> 47:39.000
Because driving at Dragon Con would never come up into the equation.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
So that is part of the reason why.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
Okay.

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
Anyhow, let's get into some news.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
Some gaming news. Loki.

47:47.000 --> 47:58.000
Yes. So, Valve, unfortunately, leaked out, I guess, their own, like, Twitch TV competitor.

47:58.000 --> 48:03.000
So, they weren't planning on actually putting this live yet.

48:03.000 --> 48:08.000
They were testing the stream, I guess, for its Steam.tv.

48:08.000 --> 48:15.000
And they had the URL was live for a few hours, basically, while they were working on updating the Steam broadcasting

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
for the main event of The International.

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
And so they are watching, like, a test feed of that.

48:21.000 --> 48:26.000
But now that this has kind of come to pass, you know, it's going to be this brand new,

48:26.000 --> 48:31.000
looks like almost like a Twitch TV service where they even have, like, the Steam chat integrated into it.

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
And, I mean, maybe it looks just like what you would expect from Twitch.

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
But I don't know if it's going to be anything beyond.

48:39.000 --> 48:43.000
I would assume it's going to be something beyond this whole International thing.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
Okay, correct me if I'm wrong, but Steam has broadcasting built into it already.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
They do.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
I've used it.

48:48.000 --> 48:53.000
Like, I remember, like, I would just run, like, because Steam Broadcasting couldn't, like,

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
you just leave it open so that friends could watch you at any time.

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
Because I seem to remember when I was online and playing Final Fantasy 13,

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
I just had it open so that people could watch me play if they wanted.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
But my thing was, when I'm on Steam, I'm not entertaining.

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
I'm just playing the game. I'm not sitting there talking. I'm just doing that.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
But I think, like, Rage Nader and maybe a couple other people actually, like,

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
would just kind of, like, peek at the game just to see what it looked like.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Yeah, and the broadcasts are kind of hidden, though.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
I mean, you have to go, like, into your community section

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
and then into broadcast to be able to see them.

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
And it's just kind of random stuff.

49:26.000 --> 49:30.000
I mean, so it's not really laid out all that well.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
So maybe this would be kind of a way to...

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
So they're trying to, like, formalize it a little bit.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Well, I mean, I don't know.

49:37.000 --> 49:44.000
I kind of think at this point it's a little difficult to launch a competitor to Twitch without money.

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
Like, and what I mean is that, you know, part of the reason why I really like being an affiliate on Twitch

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
is that Twitch makes it very clear how I can get money.

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
And, you know, I'm not just in it for the money.

49:56.000 --> 50:02.000
But at the same time, you know, if I'm going to have this platform here that says you can make money here

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
and this platform here and this platform here,

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
I'm going to choose the one where maybe I can make five cents when I stream.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
It's just five cents, but it all adds up. You know what I mean?

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
Right.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Like, you can't really make money on Mixer.

50:14.000 --> 50:18.000
Well, I mean, you can if you stream for a long time and become a partner.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
But they have some pretty big requirements for being a partner over on Mixer.

50:21.000 --> 50:26.000
From what I remember, at least last time I looked into it, before I hit affiliate on Twitch, there was that thing.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
So, I mean, is Steam going to give you money in your Steam wallet?

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
Can I tip people from my Steam wallet? Can I give them items?

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Are they going to do something like that?

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
I don't know.

50:35.000 --> 50:39.000
There's really nothing we know about it yet other than it was a thing.

50:39.000 --> 50:43.000
Also, I think one other place that Twitch does a really good job is discoverability.

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
That's one other thing I really like about Twitch is the discoverability.

50:46.000 --> 50:52.000
Like, I love the community thing, which, you know, it's kind of, you know, I know we talked about that that's going away

50:52.000 --> 50:56.000
either last week or the week before, but at least it kind of will have the tags instead

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
and that will kind of accomplish a lot of the same stuff.

50:58.000 --> 51:07.000
But here's my thing with this, is that Valve doesn't have enough manpower to run Steam, the marketplace.

51:07.000 --> 51:12.000
Do we really want them to be starting a new venture called Steam TV?

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
I mean, like, they can't curate their own fucking marketplace.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
What makes them think they're going to curate hundreds of streams?

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
I'm with you on that. I'm with you on that.

51:21.000 --> 51:26.000
How are they going to moderate? I think that's the first question Steam should have to answer.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
How are they going to moderate this?

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
Because, like, they can't. They're all algorithms, algorithms. No, it's not working.

51:32.000 --> 51:37.000
It's not working at all. There was another story that I heard.

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
There was another crypto miner that was found in another game.

51:41.000 --> 51:46.000
You know, it's like, dude, you can't manage your own marketplace.

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
What makes you think you're going to start, like, oh, let's go on some more ventures now?

51:50.000 --> 51:54.000
TigerKalonChat says YouTube gaming hasn't really caught on.

51:54.000 --> 51:58.000
No, that's a good point. I think a lot of people are getting sick of YouTube shit.

51:58.000 --> 52:06.000
Like, unfortunately, on YouTube, YouTube does not care about the content creators as much as it does the copyright people.

52:06.000 --> 52:11.000
The copyright people are always right, even when they're not right on YouTube.

52:11.000 --> 52:17.000
And I think there's so many people, like, tons of YouTube people that I know have been falsely copyright stricken

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
for something like incidental music that they had the right to use,

52:20.000 --> 52:24.000
that the game set on their website was something you can fully monetize on YouTube.

52:24.000 --> 52:29.000
And some third-party company that had no right to do it, and YouTube yanks it for that.

52:29.000 --> 52:33.000
And I think people are getting fed up with that shit, so people are jumping off YouTube.

52:33.000 --> 52:41.000
And so, as far as I'm concerned, YouTube can, you know, sit and spin until they start to side with their creators a little more.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
YouTube has become too big for its bridges.

52:46.000 --> 52:54.000
Well, yeah, I mean, and even just, like, there's also, like, the demonetization or, like, even hiding stuff from feeds.

52:54.000 --> 53:00.000
Like, there's, you know, one YouTuber I watch, Philip DeFranco, a lot, he talks about different controversial issues sometimes.

53:00.000 --> 53:06.000
Like, he was talking about, you know, the whole thing with the priests, and then also with, um...

53:06.000 --> 53:12.000
Oh, God, there's, like, some other, like, incident going on in another country where people were dying or something like that.

53:12.000 --> 53:17.000
But he was talking about that, like, in one episode, and they hid it from, like, the feeds from a lot of people.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
Like, they hid it from the homepage.

53:20.000 --> 53:27.000
Even though you may have them as, like, oh, I'm subscribed and I want notifications, they will hide it from your homepage.

53:27.000 --> 53:31.000
And you have to actually go into your subscription feeds to find it, which is stupid.

53:31.000 --> 53:36.000
And so, that obviously hits them, and so now he's got to change his format.

53:36.000 --> 53:41.000
Like, if I have a controversial story, I have to put it in its own separate video, so that one gets dinged.

53:41.000 --> 53:45.000
And my main show doesn't get dinged. It's stupid.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
I'm done with YouTube, personally.

53:47.000 --> 53:53.000
Like, maybe if a Nintendo thing, like, has an export to YouTube, I'll just use it because I'm lazy.

53:53.000 --> 54:00.000
But for the most part, like, I'm sticking to live stuff on Twitch, and if I want to do pre-recorded stuff,

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
I'm going to just kind of cross my fingers on my toes that Twitch's on-demand presence is going to grow.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
And I kind of think Amazon is going to push that.

54:06.000 --> 54:11.000
Because I know they have a YouTube partner thing for, you know, Nintendo. Do they have that for Twitch, too?

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
No.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Do they strike Twitch streams of, like, Nintendo games?

54:14.000 --> 54:21.000
No, because Twitch, I don't know if it's that Twitch won't let them, but because Twitch's bread and butter is live,

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
and the rules are a little different when it's live versus on-demand,

54:24.000 --> 54:28.000
like, Nintendo doesn't really have that same pull to be able to make those claims.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
So, it's just, it's kind of, it's just different over there.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Win one for Twitch, I guess.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
Yeah, I really think so. I mean, I don't know if that'll last forever.

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
And you are, you do need to pick what game you're streaming.

54:40.000 --> 54:44.000
So, it would be very easy for Twitch to find out what the Nintendo games are.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
So, if at some point Nintendo wants to swoop in and say,

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
we get a third of all the biddies, I suppose they'll have the right to do that.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
But, you know, I, here's the thing.

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
I'm okay with that. Like, and I've said this a long time ago.

54:55.000 --> 54:59.000
If Nintendo feels that they are entitled to a cut of the profits,

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
I'm okay with that as long as it's fair,

55:02.000 --> 55:06.000
as long as it's, you know, not completely cutting out the, you know, person that's,

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
you know, bringing the viewers in, getting their cut too.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
I'm honestly okay with all that. I just want it to be fair.

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
And what I really want is I don't want videos to get delisted.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
I don't want videos to get pulled. When somebody is that level,

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
and that could either be affiliate on Twitch or a partner,

55:22.000 --> 55:27.000
what do they call it, YouTube content partnership or whatever they call that stuff.

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
They have like the affiliates affiliated.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
When you get to that level where you agree to go by the rules,

55:33.000 --> 55:37.000
then you should be trusted that you're always going by the rules

55:37.000 --> 55:41.000
until a person and not a robot verifies that you aren't going by the rules.

55:41.000 --> 55:45.000
And then you can, you know, you can have your partnership status stripped away at that time or what have you.

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
What I don't want happening, and this is what really pissed me off at YouTube,

55:48.000 --> 55:53.000
is automated computer matching system because then that leaves it to exploitation,

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
which is what's happening with these third-party companies

55:55.000 --> 55:59.000
that have no right to be making copyright claims against shit that isn't theirs.

55:59.000 --> 56:03.000
That's what finally broke me on YouTube when some fucking, I played, what was it?

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Was it Cuphead or something I was playing?

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
And some company I'd never fucking heard of in my life

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
go in in there and copyright strike it.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
And I was like, what?

56:12.000 --> 56:16.000
And it wasn't like there's a very clear thing on the developer's website for Cuphead that's like,

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
yes, you can stream and monetize, have fun, do it.

56:20.000 --> 56:24.000
And it's like, then this fucking thing copyright striked my channel.

56:24.000 --> 56:28.000
And it's like, if I am a YouTube partner, which at the time I was,

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
because they didn't have the more strict rules in place yet,

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
why am I not being trusted?

56:32.000 --> 56:36.000
Because there's no verifications, I'm sure, of these people saying that this content is mine.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
What checks are there to do that?

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Is another algorithm looking at that?

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
No.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Looking in chat, DungeonBuster in chat says,

56:44.000 --> 56:48.000
Twitch has a number of monetization options that make it tempting for streamers too.

56:48.000 --> 56:53.000
They just rolled out membership packages so you can drop five or more donated subs at once for your favorite streamer.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
It randomly picks five people to get those subs from the dominator.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Oh, that's pretty cool.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
Let's see.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
ActDeft in chat says,

57:00.000 --> 57:04.000
my podcast is stuck to YouTube, but it's mostly convenience,

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
though we do not simulstream over on Twitch.

57:06.000 --> 57:09.000
I want to be very clear when I'm talking negative about YouTube.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
I'm talking about myself as a content creator.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
I'll still watch YouTube.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
There's a lot of stuff I watch on YouTube.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
Yeah, I watch YouTube all the time.

57:15.000 --> 57:19.000
Yeah, and if you choose and YouTube's rules don't bother you,

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
and you choose to do YouTube, more power to you.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
I support independent broadcasting in all fours.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
That's going to be very clear.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
If you're choosing to do YouTube, cool.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
That's between you and YouTube.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Between me and YouTube, I'm done.

57:31.000 --> 57:35.000
Well, and the thing with YouTube too is a lot of the creators on there

57:35.000 --> 57:39.000
know that they aren't making money from YouTube,

57:39.000 --> 57:44.000
so that's where the whole Patreon and outside subscriptions and stuff like that work.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Yeah, yeah.

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
Anyway, that was not the tangent I was expecting,

57:49.000 --> 57:54.000
but I guess this whole streaming games is just going to get bigger and bigger and bigger, right?

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
Especially as we move on to the next round of consoles

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
and see what kind of stuff is built in, and who knows?

58:00.000 --> 58:03.000
That's one of those things that people still expect Nintendo to unveil,

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
is here's how to stream your game live on Twitch.

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
Well, now, we just talked about this whole thing

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
where Nintendo has a partnership on YouTube and not on Twitch.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
Do you think Nintendo is going to build Twitch streaming into the Switch?

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
I doubt it. Although, Twitch, tWitch is pretty funny.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Twitch, tWitch.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
tWitch, tWitch.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Ah, forget it.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Hey, let's talk about Halo.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Jamie's not here. Let's talk about Halo.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Oh, Halo. Naughty.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
No, even if she was here, we would have to talk about this

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
because this is new and current and relevant news.

58:32.000 --> 58:37.000
No, all Halo jokes aside, Halo Infinite is Halo 6.

58:37.000 --> 58:41.000
So, instead of another game coming out later called Halo 6...

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
Well, that's alright. Final Fantasy Online was Final Fantasy XI, so you know.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Well, but they never really called it that anyway.

58:46.000 --> 58:50.000
But Halo Infinite is Halo 6. This is confirmed by 343 Industries.

58:50.000 --> 58:55.000
And this was during a Mixer stream where Halo writer Jeff Easterling

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
I hope I said that right, said,

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
It's Halo 6. You should just consider it Halo 6.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Don't think of it as a weird prequel kind of thing.

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
It's the next story. It's the next chapter in what's going on.

59:04.000 --> 59:09.000
So this is Halo 6, but for whatever reason they're calling it Halo Infinite.

59:09.000 --> 59:13.000
And that could be because of the, you know,

59:15.000 --> 59:19.000
We're thinking like an always persistent world, kind of like the Destiny games have had.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
You know, but maybe hopefully a little bit different.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
Because I kind of feel like we've been there, done that with Destiny.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
But maybe this is going to be Halo's version of that.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
But whatever you want to slice it, it is Halo 6.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
So, that's cool.

59:31.000 --> 59:37.000
Other things about Halo is that there's going to be a Halo crossover in Forza Horizon 4, it appears.

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
And this is thanks to yet another leak.

59:40.000 --> 59:46.000
There was an image dump on Imgur that showed some images of an early version of the game

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
that showed the Warthog from Halo in the game.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
I thought that they announced this a while ago.

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
Well, because the Warthog has been in Forza before.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
Oh.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
So that's not new.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:04.000
But the Warthog in these pictures is in a beach area where there is a Covenant spaceship in the sky

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
and a Halo ring in the distance.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Okay, that's new.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
That's new. Yeah, exactly. That part's new.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:15.000
So, it looks like there may actually be a themed Halo event on the world map.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Because some people kind of saw this icon in like a trailer or something

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
that was on the world map in July in some preview or trailer.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
So I guess, yeah, some people are data mining.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.000
It looks like there's probably going to be a Halo event that involves like a Halo actual themed course.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
But I think that's kind of rad. I'm open to that.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
That's pretty cool.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
If you can do Hot Wheels and all this other stuff that you do, why not?

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Why not Blizzard? Why not a Blizzard course?

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
I'm sorry.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Because I was thinking of the Blizzard mountain.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
You're also probably thinking of Destiny.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I am.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
But I do mean, of course, Halo in this case.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
So, Super Halo Kart. Why not?

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Super Master Chief Kart.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Alright.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Anyway, speaking of Forza Horizon though, now's your last chance to get Forza Horizon 2.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
It will be gone from the Xbox store as of September 30th.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Turn 10 and Microsoft are removing Forza Horizon 2 on September 30th.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.000
It is Xbox Live Gold's game right now of the like free game that you can get.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000
So if you don't have it, you can get the regular edition free until August 31st.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:26.000
But if you want to download the DLC for that, which I think there was like a Stormy Daniels DLC.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
No, it's Storm Island or something like that was the DLC.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I don't know, I'd be kind of interested to see what that other DLC would be, but anyway.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:39.000
And a random thought, because we have those every time I drive by the strip club that we have that's right next to the freeway.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Look and see who's on the marquee.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Yes.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
She's coming to the strip club in October.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Oh, really? Fun.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
That should be an OLR night out.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
That's just a random thought I had.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Thank you for that thought.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
That should be an OLR team building event.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Team building.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Alright. Anyhow. Why not? Jamie would have fun. We'd have a good time.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Alright, anyway. So anyway, they are saying that Forza Horizon 2 is being pulled because the title is End of Life.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
So it's a, which.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Pull those servers. Long live Forza Horizon 4.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.000
The servers got pulled a long time ago. So, you know, I think they kind of pulled those halfway through Forza Horizon 3's life cycle.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:28.000
So you know what? I'm going to guess music licenses. Probably a big part of the reason why they are not going to be selling it anymore.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:35.000
They can't stop selling the disc versions though. That's the great thing about, you know, having physical copies on discs.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
This is true.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
You can still buy those after the day.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Consider that.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
But don't expect to be able to get DLC or anything else. So be sure to catch up on that.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000
If you have a copy of Forza Horizon 2 sitting around, make sure you've got all your freebies, make sure you've grabbed any DLC you want to get.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Get that before September 30th.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
So yes, we just went from Halo to Forza to more Forza.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
That was a lot of ground there, Loki. What's next?

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Rumors and speculation.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Yeah, our favorite.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
People have been staring.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Because remember during the last Smash event they had a green logo that was in the bottom that it was all pixelated and you're not supposed to know what it is yet.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
So people have been staring cross-eyed and trying to figure out what it is.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Apparently the bottom of the frame wasn't as pixelated as everything else.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:25.000
And so fans have made out that perhaps it says spirits.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.000
And it has something to do with the fact that, you know, why we're seeing all of these characters getting killed.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:40.000
No word exactly on what that's supposed to be, but it'd be interesting since we have seen several characters get killed in the trailer so far.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
It's alluding to that.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Interesting.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
I don't know what that would be about, but...

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Alright, well, you know, I'll just chalk it up to another crazy Nintendo fanboy theory.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
But alright, okay. Go ahead.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Next thing you're going to tell me is the Phantom Pains is Metal Gear Solid 5.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.000
I don't know what to believe anymore. It's a wholly original game.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Act F says, they're getting revived with the Dragon Balls. Goku confirmed.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
S2 and Hunter Matt says, hmm, seems like a reach.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Dark 2 CD says, oh yeah, I forgot Mario got murdered in the Ridley trailer.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
So there you go.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
So, some of the comments in chat.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000
I'd be fine with Goku being in the game.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:28.000
There's going to be 5,000 different modes in Super Smash Bros. and it's still not going to be enough for some people.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I want my single player mode from Wii. I actually like that quite a bit.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Wart didn't make the game, therefore it's trash.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.000
And there's still months. Hey, if they haven't announced anything about their online service and that's coming out, there's still time.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Oh yeah, there's still time.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
It's like reverse valve time.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:53.000
There's always time for games to find their fans and get more sales and get a second wind in the game.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:59.000
As Gone Home is about to experience, Gone Home is going to be releasing on the Switch very soon.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:07.000
It was originally released in 2013 for the PC and then it came out on, what, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One like three years later.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Gone Home was supposed to arrive on the Wii U, but it never happened. Fancy that. I wonder why.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:21.000
They just decided to cancel it on the Wii U and they moved it over to the Switch and now you can get Gone Home on the Switch starting August 23rd.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
And there is a part of me, again, I liked Gone Home a lot.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:32.000
I know Gone Home gets a lot of shit because it's not a very action-y type of game. It's very much an interactive story.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
That's fine.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Some people call it a walking simulator to degrade the game. I don't necessarily think that's an insult.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Sometimes I like exploring new worlds to learn new stories and things and that was certainly a lot of what Gone Home was.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000
I hope this isn't too spoilery for Gone Home, but the game came out five years ago.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I think the whole thing for me with Gone Home is that I was expecting it to be a scary game.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:07.000
So I was playing it the whole time thinking, oh god, I'm going to open one of these doors and the boogeyman is going to come out and rip my head off and it's going to be really explicit and all this stuff.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:14.000
But it never happened and instead the game kind of ended up being this whole other thing that was actually really neat.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:21.000
And that's kind of what I really liked about Gone Home was that you expected one thing, but you got something completely different.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:29.000
I don't know, I kind of like that, but I guess other people are pissed off they didn't get eaten to death by zombies. That's what they were hoping for in Gone Home.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Now, are there people that still need to experience this? They don't own PCs?

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I guess there is...

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
I have yet to play the game.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Are you going to check it out on the Switch?

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I already have it on PC.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
I just haven't played the game because it's a part of my Steam library.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
I know, I hear you.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
I probably have it on Playstation 4 too.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
It was a plus title at one point.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I probably have it.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:07.000
But I guess there is a small portion of Nintendo hardcore fanboys that just don't do a lot of PC gaming that aren't going to play the game if it doesn't come out on their consoles.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
So I guess it's going to be good news to some people.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I'm not bagging on the game. I'm just kind of like, wow, who's left that wants to play this game that hasn't by now?

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Because it has been so cheap on Steam.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
And it has been a giveaway on these other consoles.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:27.000
But I guess even a small subset of people, if it sells a few more copies, is going to be worth it.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:34.000
And I imagine, kind of like Bobby was joking earlier, but is maybe not too terribly far from the truth.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
And it's already in Unity and was published on Playstation 4 and Xbox One.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Click the export into the Switch button.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Obviously some of the button for the rules of the system and stuff have to be changed.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Yeah, there's more work than just that.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I know, but it's not like they're having to redo the whole game.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Right, that's true.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
But I don't know.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
I think what we really need.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Gone Home, I'm glad that there are more indie games that are coming to the Switch.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000
I just wish their marketplace was usable.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Yeah, the Nintendo market is getting pretty garbage.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:14.000
And it does not lend itself well to discoverability of things that aren't new, if you don't know it's there.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Or at least Nintendo kind of needs a better online shop.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Like where you can buy stuff on the web and have it queued up to your Nintendo Switch.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Which you can do.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.000
But the online version of the store is not terribly different from what you get on the Switch itself.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.000
So it would be kind of neat if that was a little snappier and worked a little faster and had some better discoverability in it.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
So, listen.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Dr. Suya in chat says, I do have it, Gone Home, on PC.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I'll probably check it out at some point when my new computer is back up.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:49.000
You should. I mean, Gone Home will only take you, like, and maybe this is the other reason why people had a problem with it.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
It's only like a two to three hour game.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Like it's like watching a long movie, basically.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
It's not a terribly long game.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:02.000
So, I mean, maybe if you really get stuck or confused and can't figure out where to go.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
But mostly by retracing your steps and like, have I been through this door?

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
You'll figure it out. I don't think you're going to have lost too long.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Was it like, Firewatch is coming to the Switch too.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
So I mean, it's like all of the Unity games.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
So all of those quote unquote walking simulator games.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
But they're all really good.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Honestly, like, this is going to be.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
So, okay, so I think here's the genre to me.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Edith Finch, Gone Home, Firewatch, and Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Out of those games, honestly, Firewatch is probably my least favorite of the four.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
And that's not to say it's bad by any means.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
I just wasn't thrilled with how the story kind of resolved at the end.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
So they're like puzzle games?

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Is it more like, you know, like Myst or something like that where you're like solving puzzles?

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Or is it more of just kind of a story?

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
It depends on the game.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Like, I think there was a puzzle or two in Gone Home.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
But it's nothing you can't figure out pretty quickly.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Because there was a game I liked except for the fact that the save system corrupted.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
And it was all fucked up in that sense.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
But there was a game called Ether One that was pretty interesting.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Where you're kind of like diving into people's memories or something like that.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
And there was like a whole puzzle.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
I mean, it's a puzzle game. It's a first person puzzle game.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
But it was really good.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Just its own engine killed itself.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
I mean, so that was the problem I ran into.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000
But here's the interesting thing. Out of all of those games, my absolute favorite is Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And in that one, there is absolutely no puzzles.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
It's just exploration.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
And learning different parts of the story that unfold as you explore new areas.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000
And find these new places to go and look around.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Because again, the whole thing about Everybody's Gone to the Rapture is that nobody's there.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000
So it's like you're going through this town revealing its memories.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
You're going through people's shit when they're not there to learn more about them.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000
And it's really interesting. To me, it was just a really interesting way to tell a story.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
And I loved the story in that game. The ending wrecked me. It's great.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000
But you know what? I know people that fucking hate that game.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.000
It's truly different folks like different types of games.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
It's just like movies.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Oh yeah, you're right. It's just like movies.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Every movie that comes out is an action movie.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:22.000
And for me, a lot of the big bang explosion action movies, I'm like, who cares?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Although, I can be honest. If I'm going to go see a movie like Transformers,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I'm not going to expect anything but, or better yet, Independence Day.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000
You know exactly what you're going to get when you go see a movie like Independence Day, right?

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000
It's just, what's that guy, Roland Emmerich? All his movies are blow shit up.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000
You know when you go see something, you're going to see something get blown the fuck up.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
You know it's going to be stupid.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
It's going to be stupid.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000
But if you go in expecting anything different, then that's kind of your own fault.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000
And that's exactly how I reviewed the Mamma Mia sequel last week.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:05.000
If you go in there expecting anything different than, you know, a bunch of older men and women

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
dancing around to ABBA songs and Cher shows up and steals the whole fucking thing.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Like if somehow you're expecting anything less than what you're going to get when I describe it as that.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
There's no Italians in this at all.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Anyway.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Let's see. I'm looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Bonds006 says, so Gone Home is how to commit B and E, breaking and entering.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Well, that's kind of how the game starts.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Except it is your parents' house.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
So is it really breaking and entering?

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I don't know.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Let's see. I'm going to chat at live.vognetwork.com.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Some folks are talking about The Meg. Tigerfly says, you see The Meg. It's a fun movie.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Is that the, like...

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
The giant shark one.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
What is that? Is it Shark Week?

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Because we got that, we got Sharknado. Was Sharknado tonight?

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000
They had a final Sharknado, which like is time travel and stuff like that.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000
All I heard was that Alaska Thunderfuck is in that movie, and that makes me...

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
That's a drag queen from RuPaul's Drag Race.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
So, I mean...

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
I don't know what she plays, but I'm sure it's great.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
I love that Sharknado is basically...

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Like, Sharknado is a ridiculous thing to begin with, and then there's like...

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
We're embracing this camp. We're just going full camp.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Turn the camp to 11.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:25.000
The thing about Alaska Thunderfuck is that she talks a certain way.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And she's very overacting in the way that she delivers her lines.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:37.000
When she's talking and on stage and presenting, it kind of sounds like this.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000
So I'm just thinking, like, in the movie, it's going to be like, what?

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
It's going to be amazing.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.000
I've never seen any of the Sharknado movies, but I know people that, like, obsess.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Because it's going to be garbage, but you know what kind of garbage it is going into it.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Yeah, it's true. That's true.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
All right. Anyhow...

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
It's like Earth Defense Force.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:06.000
You know that the construction of the game is garbage, but you know what you're expecting,

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
and that's what you go in there expecting is exactly what you get.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000
All right, we've got a couple more stories, then we're going to get to the classic game of the week. Loki.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:26.000
All right, so apparently there has been a court case that has blocked the sale of some online cheating tools for Grand Theft Auto Online from being sold.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
So that's good, I guess.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:42.000
So apparently, yeah, the U.S. District Court of Southern District, New York, they issued a preliminary injunction against a guy that was selling cheating software for Grand Theft Auto 5.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:51.000
And apparently this is an ongoing lawsuit between Take-Two Interactive and David Zipper.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
That's his name, Zipper.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Because the company claims he has threatened irreparable harm to its game and business by creating cheating programs online.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Well, yes, of course, because this is their cash cow. They make so much fucking money from Grand Theft Auto Online.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Of course they're going to come after him. Of course.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:19.000
This is so interesting in this day and age, because I've heard of World of Warcraft going for people like this.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:24.000
I've heard of, I think, some other online shooty-shoot games that sue the people that make these cheats and stuff.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:33.000
This very interesting side effect of gaming today is that back in the day when things were single-player experiences,

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
people made cheats and it was whatever, whatever, because it was single-player.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:44.000
But now that real money is involved, multiple people are involved, yeah, game companies are really not having it with these robots.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Yeah, because they're making tons of money, and basically this mod would give you the abilities to give yourself money.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:57.000
And that takes money from Take-Two, and they're not going to have any of it.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:06.000
But, yeah, he had a program called Menu, and basically it was sold for $10.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:14.000
And it was a mod for Grand Theft Auto 5 that let players use money-making exploits while playing the game's online portion.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:23.000
And then also you'd be able to do other things to make yourself, you know, invulnerable and whatnot.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:31.000
And then I guess he also broke off, I guess, and started selling a second program called Absolut, which was $20 to $40.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Like the vodka?

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Sort of.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Okay.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
But, yeah, so basically he's in a whole lot of trouble.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Alright, well, think twice before you make a cheat program that's going to mess with an online thing,

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:53.000
because the developers of the game may not be happy with you, especially if they're making a lot of money off that online thing.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:59.000
They're making tons of stuff. I mean, they're doing lots of free content, but all of that content costs in-game money, so, you know.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:07.000
So, we've heard a lot about the ROM sites out there getting shut down because of, you know, Nintendo, you know,

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.000
kind of wanting to protect, you know, their intellectual properties and all this stuff.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
We got into that a little bit last week.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
It's going to be interesting to see what Nintendo thinks of this.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
It is a new, like, device. It's not Nintendo's device, obviously.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
This is something else coming out.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
The Classic 2 Magic.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:31.000
It is an attachment for the Super Nintendo Classic Mini that will allow you to add more games to Nintendo's little hardware.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:36.000
What it is, but it's not like a hack your Super Nintendo Classic.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:42.000
It's an actual little device that you plug into it that you then can plug cartridges into.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
So you use real cartridges.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000
It's still hacking the device.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000
And then it powers, basically, your device, yeah, by basically hacking into it.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.000
But, anyway, you can back up the ROMs, wink, and copy the ROMs, wink,

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000
thanks to the inclusion of a USB drive that is also available with this thing.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
They are also doing one for the NES Classic Mini.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:08.000
It's going to be, what, $59.95, I think, if this is coming out, if Nintendo doesn't try to shut this down.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000
But I don't know if Nintendo would shut this down because, A, I have to be honest,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.000
$59.95 seems a little steep for me for this because can't you just get a Retron for that price?

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Or one of the other many knockoff hardware things that will play, like, just instantly dump the games and play them on the TV?

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Like, don't Retron consoles only cost, like, 50 bucks at this point?

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Or I'll just go with one of the many other ROM sites out there and just download the fucking game.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.000
I'm like, if I have a physical copy of the cartridge, I'm not paying $60 to dump my own ROM,

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
to play the same ROM that I can download online.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Fuck it. You know what? Just, who cares?

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
And Brad from PodCulture in our chat points out it still hacks. It alters the firmware.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Um, yeah, it does. It has to. That's the only way it's going to be able to work.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Oh, whoops! We left this functionality in. Dope.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
It'll be interesting to see if Nintendo has anything to say about that.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
And Brad from PodCulture says, not the Retron 5.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000
What about the Retron, don't they just call it Retron HD?

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000
And I think it's the one that only does, because Retron 5 does, like, Game Boy and everything.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000
But isn't there, like, a Retron that only does, like, Nintendo and Super Nintendo?

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Maybe Sega Genesis as well, like, a Retron 3?

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I feel like, there's all these different configurations out there.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
They, like, they sell the Retron at Fry's Electronics now.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Yeah, that's all public domain now, I think, the copyrights for this.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Yeah, I think the hardware copyrights expire after, what, like, 25 years, is it?

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Yeah, something like that.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.000
So, wouldn't PlayStation 1's copyrights come up, like, 2019?

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Are we gonna start to see knock-off PlayStation?

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000
I think that's gonna be interesting, that they'll have, they're gonna,

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Yeah, they're gonna sell, like, PlayStations that you can hook up via HDMI,

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000
before the actual PlayStation 4 will play those games.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Do you think that might pressure Sony to do backwards compatibility, at least for PS1 games?

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:03.000
If the patents, and again, I am no expert on patent law,

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.000
but my understanding is, the reason why these Retrons and things are allowed to exist,

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:13.000
and Nintendo cannot come after them, is because the NES, and the Super NES, and the Genesis,

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.000
and all these systems that it's, I mean, they've been out for so long, that the technology patents are up.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.000
It's great, like, I went over to our local record used store, Dimple, or whatever,

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:28.000
so they have, like, if you want to get into all that retro stuff, they have retro everything,

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:33.000
like game controllers, like, oh hey, I want a Nintendo 64, well here's everything you need,

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
you know what I mean, and even the games, it's fantastic.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Yeah. So, hmm, I'm very curious to see what happens, yeah, if it's,

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:46.000
because PlayStation 1 was 1994 or 1985, might not be till 2020.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I didn't get mine until 97, so I don't know.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
I got mine when Final Fantasy VII came out.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000
I want to say I remember a friend talking about playing Mortal Kombat on PlayStation,

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
when I was a senior in high school, which was in 95, 96.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:02.000
I suppose, if only I had this vast information source in front of me, called the internet,

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:09.000
I suppose that I could find out using said internet, maybe if there was an engine to search in.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Do you think there might be a Wikipedia article that would just have it right there in the sidebar?

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Yeah, I mean, probably, yeah.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Well, now with PlayStation, because it's like, I don't know, which PlayStation are you talking about?

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Which PlayStation do you mean, the PlayStation Family, or the PlayStation?

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Uh, 94, December 3rd.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Okay, so then that means December of 2019, if, I mean, I don't know, but see, I'm no expert on this.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000
I don't want to get, like, Rob, you said this, I don't know how this all exactly works,

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:44.000
because for some things, like, Disney still manages to protect Mickey Mouse, like, all these years later.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
That's trademarks, yeah.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Oh, okay, trademarks are trademarks.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Oh, okay, I get it now.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
So they could, they, yeah.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000
But they keep extending it, like, every time Mickey Mouse-

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Because they're assholes.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Yeah, I know, Disney lobbies Washington to extend that stuff, because, but at the same time,

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:06.000
can you imagine what would happen if Mickey Mouse suddenly became public domain?

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Have you seen his normal cartoons now?

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:15.000
It's like fucking, like, Ren and Stimpy or SpongeBob, it's like, fuck, like, what the fuck happened to Mickey Mouse?

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
I'm just thinking about all the pornos people are going to make with Mickey Mouse.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Oh, yeah, they'll start then.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Or cell phone games starring Mickey Mouse. Anyway.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Oh, yeah, like, that's going to hold them back.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.000
It's not going to happen anyway, because it got extended so far.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:35.000
No, like, seriously, my kids watch, you know, the Mickey Mouse, like, cartoons on the YouTube Kids app and stuff.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Oh.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
And it is fucking obnoxious now.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Like, I mean, like, the old cartoons are kind of weird and stuff, but, like, they're fucked up looking.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Like, it's like crystal meth Mickey Mouse is what it is.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Does the old Mickey Mouse stuff get into that really, like, yucky, like, borderline, well, not even borderline, just, like, flat out racist stuff that some of the old cartoons got into?

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Because some of these cartoons were made during World War II and stuff when people were really fucking racist.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:09.000
I don't know about that, but, like, the new Mickey Mouse cartoon that they have now, because they tried to revamp it, just like they did with DuckTales, except DuckTales doesn't suck.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
It's actually pretty good.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:18.000
The new Mickey Mouse cartoon, it's like, it's seriously, like, crystal meth Mickey. It's just weird shit.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Well, obviously, anything new is gonna take, but, I mean, like, I know when they've released, like, the Warner Brothers collection, like, they have a big old disclaimer that's like,

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Hey, you know, this, and I'm not gonna say it word for word, but it's only, like, hey, this is a product of a different time, so the views expressed here do not express the way that we think now,

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:46.000
but to suppress this stuff would be to hide that this stuff exists, you know, and we have to learn from the mistakes that we've made in the past.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Just something like that. The Warner Brothers has a pretty tactful little disclaimer on their thing, you know, so I'm just, I'm, you know, I know they made a lot of, like, cartoons that you go back and watch now.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Like, some of, like, the Popeye cartoons and stuff from back in the day are like, dang, like, this is, you know, but it was very much a product of a different era, you know, when racism was everywhere in part because we were at war with other countries, you know?

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:19.000
You know, anyway, just interesting. Anyway, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Tigerclaw says, did you hear Donald's new voice?

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Yes, yes, I, yes, I did see that, where Don Cheadle was doing the voice of it. I did watch that clip, yeah.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:41.000
sjo100matt kind of pointing out that Song of the South is still banned. That's still a thing that Disney, at least in the US, I believe in other countries, Disney has, like, kind of obscurely released, you know, for collectors that need to have everything.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:57.000
But it's interesting because that movie is banned, but yet Splash Mountain is still such a big ride at Disneyland, which, like, the song Zippidy-Doo-Dah comes from that movie, so it's interesting.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
The kids don't know that, though.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
No, kids don't know that. They don't.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:22.000
So, interesting. And bonds006 kind of also reinforcing about the disclaimer there. They do state that the contents can be offensive. Yeah, I mean, in the lens of our society today, they are very offensive, but, you know, we have to learn from the mistakes of the past, or we're doomed to repeat it, I suppose.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Alright, anyhow, let's talk about, before we get to the Classic Game of the Week, I also want to talk about SNES Party. So, speaking of other things that Nintendo may or may not shut down, apparently there's a new emulator called SNES Party, and it's being branded as an experimental way to play SNES games with your friends online, all within your browser, using WebRTC. Well, this is gonna go well.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
I see no faults with this.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Yeah, so before Monday, and the law office is open, you might want to head over to SNES.party if you want to check this out, because it's just, you know, again, the law office is open Monday morning, and this will probably be gone by then.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:17.000
But if you want to check that out, you can. I haven't checked this out, but apparently people play online, and it works pretty well. I did not think online play in emulators was anything new. I seem to remember SNES9X had online.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I did not think online play in it a long time ago, so it was kind of, you know, because the internet wasn't as fast then, it wasn't as good. It's probably better now, but yeah.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:40.000
If you want to check that out, you can. Enjoy it before it's gone. Alright, but I think while we're enjoying some Super Nintendo classics, maybe we ought to enjoy some other classic games of the week.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:53.000
And thanks to what we know as, is Bobby Black Wolf out there, Radio Magic. We are joined by the one and only Dark Sakura for the classic game of the week. Hi.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Hi. It's so, you're here. I am. It's like I'm actually here or something. It's like you never left us in the first place.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.000
I'm working stuff out to make it at least to some damn life. Alright, no, it's all good. I gotta pay my bills. Alright.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Well, we gotta educate the children on a classic game of the week, and I think this is one I bet very few have played. It is actually one of the first MMOs.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:26.000
But this is important. I think this is an important cornerstone of gaming history. What is the classic game of the week?

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.000
The classic game of the week is Gemstone and all of its iterations that have existed, all four of them.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000
And there's no background music this week. No, because it was a text game. It was a mud. It was a mud.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Basically, and if you don't know what a mud, it's a multi-user dungeon or multi-user dimension as some places called it. But this is what we had in the day.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000
We were playing World of Warcraft in DOS. That was a mud.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:03.000
You throw shit at Orgrim Doomhammer. Doomhammer punches you into oblivion. Now you're in another game.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Jaina cries and casts ice spells wildly.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Yeah. Anyway, Gemstone 4 was the last one, but basically the whole game is sort of a high fantasy in a world called Alanthea.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:29.000
There were a bunch of different versions of it. The original Gemstone was actually nothing but a demo for Genie, as in capital G, capital E, N-I-E.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:35.000
So not like Robin Williams playing the Genie in Aladdin. It's Genie!

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Genie was General Electric Network for Information Exchange, which was an old online service that was like, I think it peaked in 94.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
It was like AOL or CompuServe, but worse.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Or as we called Compusuck back in the day. And Buttigy.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Hey, I loved Prodigy.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000
I know, but we called it Buttigy.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
We've gotten into this argument before.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000
We were the AOL crowd.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Yeah, I know. AOL's where all the lame-o's were at. Lame-o-L.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Hey, I met my husband there.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Wow.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Okay, well keep in mind, I was on AOL like in AOL 2.5 that ran in DOS.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Was that the version that came on every CD-ROM for free?

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.000
No, that was AOL 3.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Oh, okay.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Anyway, the first playable version was called Gemstone 2, but it was like a closed bracket and an open bracket, so it looked kind of like a weird Roman numeral thing.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:33.000
And it came out in 1988 on Genie, and it was seriously one of the first MMORPGs, and it is one of the longest running online games still active.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Wow.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Yes, Gemstone is still around.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:42.000
So guess what I'll be livestreaming after the show tonight. No, I'm just kidding.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.000
That would be fun, though.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000
The interface actually looks pretty interesting now, but I'll go into that.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:55.000
It has always been subscription-based through the website or different ways, but you also have different subscription levels like Premium, Platinum, and Shattered.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000
And then there is a free-to-play model that started in March 2015.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:09.000
So as far as the current iteration of it, it is built on the Symmetronics engine, the IFE, which means Interactive Fiction Engine.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:16.000
And it's capable of changing nearly any aspect of the game on the fly, which allows updates with no downtime.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Imagine if you were in WoW and it just patched while you were playing. Could you imagine that? No, because WoW never works.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Well, actually, it does like to download stuff in the launcher. To be fair, Dark Saga, the launcher kind of does that.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Yeah, yeah. Anyway, so it means that the game is rarely offline. It has a full 24-hour uptime cycle with the occasional crash, and crashes are rare.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.000
So it is nothing but a text medium. It can be played with a Telnet interface.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Can you imagine being the engineer assigned to make sure that Gemstone is up and running and just sitting there?

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Yeah, I've been running the same online game for 30 years. We haven't changed a goddamn thing.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Well, they have changed things. That's what I'm going to get into.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:17.000
So basically, the oldest interface for Windows was called the Wizard Front End. But since then, it actually was superseded by the Storm Front in 2003, which basically lets you point-and-click on text in the item to see what your available responses are.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
You got a big storm coming.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:28.000
So you click on Big Storm Coming, and you get options Run Like Fuck, Dig a Hole, Cry, or Shit Your Pants.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Oh, but I've played the game called Don't Shit Your Pants. When does that become eligible for Classic Game of the Week?

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Eventually.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
You will make it Classic Game of the Week, right?

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
One day.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:45.000
We have to make sure this show goes another seven or eight years, just so that we can ensure the very last Classic Game of the Week we ever do is Don't Shit Your Pants.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Yeah.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:32:00.000
So anyway, there's a Java one that has a browser called escape. There is still the Wizard one that exists for Mac Classic, and a front end called Avalon for Mac OS X.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:08.000
There are no Linux clients, because no one likes Linux people, apparently, and Linux people have to run wine to be able to play these things in other versions.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:18.000
So basically, Gemstone, the original Gemstone, the one that was a demo, was demonstrated in 1987, and then it was, like I said, only a model.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000
And then in April 1988, Gemstone 2 became available to G&E customers.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:29.000
It was short lived. Gemstone 3 came out into beta testing in 1989, and launched in 1990.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Now here's the fun part. I played the fuck out of Gemstone 3 on AOL in 1995.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Yes. Is old.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:54.000
And so it really just maintained some significant parts of it, but not all of it, and the character records were not brought over in the transition, so everyone had to start over.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Gemstone 3 evolved into Gemstone 4 November 2003, but all of the game world and character records were the same.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:13.000
And it was supposed to promise, Gemstone 3 was, that players could receive real life versions of the gems played in game.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:22.000
It originally was operated with a license to use Rollmaster game mechanics and the Shadow World environment from Iron Crown Enterprises.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Then again, they let it also expire in 1995, and removed all the ice intellectual property from Gemstone.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:38.000
So a lot of stuff was really changed, like the name of the world was originally Colthea, and it went to Alanthea, and then they renamed their deities.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Basically they called it de-icing. So I wish we could de-ice the real world. Gemstone became available on AOL in September 1995, which was when I was in my second year of college.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.000
And when some of our listeners were not born.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Shut up. But that was after the de-icing. It had already been on CompuSuck and Buttigy before that. Sorry, CompuServe and Prodigy.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:16.000
When AOL went to flat rate pricing, Gemstone actually went to 1.4 million customer hours in a single month.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Going between 2,000 to 2,500 simultaneous players. Could you imagine?

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:28.000
So that was like when the plus pricing for bonus stuff was no longer around. It was just part of your monthly fee or whatever.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:34.000
I had a free account though during those days because I was a chat host for Cartoon Network.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Oh, that's so random.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Did you know that?

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Now that you said it, yeah, I remember you telling stories about it. It's not one of those things. This is my friend Jamie, and she was the moderator for Cartoon Network in 1995.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.000
On AOL.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Back in the day, because this was right when they announced, when we were picking our names, I found out ahead of time that Cartoon Network was getting Voltron.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:05.000
So I was like, I want CNW Allura for my name, because you pick a character. So I got Allura and my friend, who is still on buddies with on Facebook, was CNW Keith.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000
So we used to just give each other crap the whole time in chat. It was pretty funny.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Anyway, back to this. Gemstone was really well received. For being a surprisingly empty game environment, it got a lot of people involved in there.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:29.000
But as I said, as it went down, it became a much more rewarding experience with built-in commands, so you didn't have to guess.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:37.000
And other types of character ability, you could eventually evolve characters to have different abilities and traits. It was really awesome.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.000
In 1997, it actually called it one of the top ten online game picks.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:52.000
And at the time, the game was getting over 50,000 hours of use a month. And it was the 1998 finalist for online game of the year.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000
And in 1996, it was AOL Member's Choice Awards.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:08.000
So Gemstone Foreshadowed came out in May 2010. And it was released with an unrestricted PVP combat system and no policy against automated play.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:18.000
And that brings us up to date with Gemstone that is still running. And honestly, I hope it never goes away, because fuck, we need a mud every so often.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000
And that's it.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.000
That's it! So you're encouraging our listeners this week to get out there and play in the mud.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000
And read.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Reading is what?

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Fundamental.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.000
And now the library is closed.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Anything else you need to tell the folks out there listening before we head off for this week?

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
If things work out, I may still stop by.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Okay. Oh, so you may show up later in the show anyway.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Yeah, because I actually do have Sunday off, but it's my sister event.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Right.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000
So if everything works out, I may still be able to come by.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000
She's so unpredictable!

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Well, I told you earlier things.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Alright, let's get back to the show.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:05.000
But we have, we have leis and oreos to eat.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:12.000
We do. Alright, well, but we got to magically go back to the present and do the show.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Whereas in the past, we're getting, you know, hefty and snacking away.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Alright, bye.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
A big thank you to Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Isn't that interesting that, man, Radio Magic works so fast because I just got this text like in the seconds while that little thing was playing from Dark Sakura that says,

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:45.000
I'm not making it to the rest of the show. I'm tired and overwhelmed. I'm going to shower and face a rosé.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:53.000
She had some good, I think, I think I'm okay to share this with you guys because she talks a lot about her sisters of perpetual indulgence and the stuff she's going through.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000
So tonight they elevated her to like, she's a full on sister now.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:03.000
So be like, she, she made the frat. She's been rushing the frat this whole time she made the frat and they made her a sister tonight.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
So that's really exciting for her. So that's awesome. Yeah, no, it is awesome.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:14.000
So, um, yeah, so, so that's why she's a very exhausted, but I knew, see, and you might be like, isn't she missing the show cause of work?

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Yes, but tonight would have been a night that she was going to be preplanned out anyway because of this other stuff.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:29.000
So anyway, she has a very busy life and she will make time for you where possible and we'll make time for some rapid fire news right now. Loki.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Yes. We'll just talk about halo, halo, halo, halo, halo, and more halo. But first we're going to talk about Soul Calibur 6.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000
You're the one that will get the death penalty, not me.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:50.000
I'm not afraid of death. Um, Soul Calibur 6 has gone gold apparently and there's some more, um, character and story details coming soon.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Um, so there's a tweet that our souls are burned into the disc. Let's see how much fuel I have left.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:11.000
And then, you know, I guess I'm assuming that there's going to be an announcement at Gamescom that we're going to have, um, about Soul Calibur 6 and its story and stuff. So that'd be pretty cool.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Um, apparently there's going to be an upcoming season pass as well, which is going to include four additional characters additionally, um, or in addition to the 17 already announced.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:37.000
And that they said that the, I don't know, um, yeah, due out on the 18th of October. So I'm guessing that we're going to be seeing some more information come this week during Gamescom.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Absolutely. Yay. I can't wait for Soul Calibur 6.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:48.000
All right. And then, um, did they already, are they going to have guest characters this time?

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:57.000
You know, what was funny is I was thinking of that today. I was like, did they ever announce who the guest character was? And yes, they did. And we covered it some time ago. It is Geralt from The Witcher.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Oh, right, right. I wasn't sure if that was like a, you know, system specific thing, but I guess.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:09.000
No, it's kind of like Ezio. The last round was in Soul Calibur 5 was in all the games. They, they, I think, uh, four was the last time they had.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Gone the days of Darth Vader and Yoda.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Well, but even then, if I remember right, it started that way and then they made the other DLC. Like you could download Yoda.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Yeah. So even then it still ended up being all the same. So I think the last like true, true separate exclusives was probably two. Did, did three have exclusive?

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.000
I'm trying to remember if three had an exclusive character, a guest character on three, but three was only on PlayStation. It was not on Xbox.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Yeah. So I don't know, but obviously everyone remembers Soul Calibur two because everybody remembers link and the GameCube version of the game, which was amazing. So yeah.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:51.000
But, uh, Geralt is the, uh, from The Witcher is the guest character at this time around. Cool. Yeah. All right. And then a PlayStation VR hits 3 million in sales.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.000
They've sold 3 million. So VR is dead. Of course. I'm hoping to see some more.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Well, I know they have more VR games coming out, but I'm hoping to see some more VR games come out.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:10.000
I, I've still been a very bad boy and not really playing my PlayStation VR, but you see my living room. It's a disaster.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:20.000
It's going to happen eventually. I mean, the Tetris is when Tetris comes out, it's fucking happening. Like I'm so excited. What did they, do they have that game dated yet?

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:32.000
I think it's October. I think it's October. I'm so excited. But, uh, there's some YouTube's out there where you can like really see it. Like they, they showed a lot more from, from E3 and, but rez rez is pretty awesome.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:42.000
I played rez in VR. I want to play that. There's other VR stuff I want to play too. Uh, you got me the, uh, as much as I am not the biggest fan of boo jumpscare games, I will play it.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.000
It's not all that jump. I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's fun. I love that game.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:52.000
I played it when Shane brought his thing. Cause you know, he loves until dawn. He brought his VR over one play. He made me play it. It was, it was fun.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:42:01.000
I love that game. It was like, seriously, my, my most favorite game on there. And I hope they make a sequel to it someday because it's fantastic. It's, it's just such a fun game.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Until dawn or the rush of blood, the rush of blood, like an until dawn two is a gimme like there that has to be under development.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Like they, I don't think they've officially announced it, but I would be, I would be floored if that game is not under development.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Or at the very least, like, you know, being that it can do rollercoasters pretty well, I'd love to see like a rollercoaster game that didn't suck cause they have like a, there's one that's like, Oh, build your own rollercoaster game is made in unity. But it was shit. It was absolute dog shit.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:40.000
What do you think this means? So for VR, cause that's, that's pretty good. I can't imagine the HTC Vive and, and Oculus have reached similar numbers because I mean, and that's not, it's just a PC.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:48.000
It's a little, you have to be a little more hobbyist enthusiast to really kind of, whereas PlayStation VR is very plug and play, which was what it was always going to be.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000
We knew this when they announced it for PlayStation. It's going to be a great like entry level VR for people.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:02.000
I still want to get like a VR set up for my computer because my computer can run. I've got 10 60 in it, so I can run it. Um, I just don't know.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:09.000
And I think a big problem with VR and much like you want the other motion gaming that they had is you need the space for it.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:20.000
And I granted, like, I know that not everything requires me to stand up and that's why until dawn rush of blood is fantastic because you can just sit there in a chair and play the whole game.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.000
In fact, they actually, it's better to kind of sit there in a chair and play the game.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:28.000
The other reason why I want to set up the PlayStation VR, you can do the 3D Blu-rays.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Yes. Remember that? Tron. I have Tron 3D Blu-ray. I do have that. I think that's like one of two 3D Blu-rays I own. Tron and the Lion King.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Why not? Sure. An interesting double feature night. Yeah. Yes. I do want to watch Tron in 3D again. That'd be awesome.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:53.000
But, uh, God, like anything, Tron and VR would be fantastic. Why hasn't that been a thing?

01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Well, because Tron video game didn't do too well. It wasn't. Well, that's because it wasn't VR. I mean, we had, I don't know.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:09.000
I think it was for plenty of reasons. We're going to have to have somebody make something that it's in the cyberspace and it looks like Tron, but it's not Tron.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:23.000
All right. Well, didn't, didn't they do that with, um, uh, Saints Row, fucking the universe. They go into the universe. That's all like Tron theme is like, it's not Tron wink, the cyberpunk stuff.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Yes. They do like the whole, like, Oh, we're going into a computer thing. And okay. But it's like, all right, because I mean, well, this is like back when the matrix is supposed to be a thing.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:40.000
It was supposed to be the dominate tricks. Get it? Ha ha ha. Right. Right. S and M ha ha matrix.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Uh, let's see. Tiger class says, if we get a new Tron VR game, it will probably be when they reboot the Tron movie.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Uh, sadly I'm losing hope that Tron three is ever going to happen because the, the actor and actress, Olivia Wilde, is that her name?

01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:02.000
And, uh, Garrett Hedlund, like surely their contract, like they're holding windows gotta be coming up like that. You can only hold them for so long to make them do it.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:14.000
And, uh, I don't know if that's still going to be there. I just see bad. They have like a really awesome premise and it's just like, it sounds like if you know what you believe or whatever, uh, tomorrow land.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Remember that George Clooney movie that tanked called tomorrow land. That is why there's not a new Tron movie.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:30.000
I know. I think it's shitty too, but that's, well, it's because they found out, Hey, we can spend money and make a Tron movie, which might make its money back.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Or we can make yet another Star Wars movie. The cram that, that didn't help. I mean, that's also one of the downsides to Disney having got Star Wars is that that's their scifi thing now, you know, but here's, you know, all hope is not lost because remember we are getting that Tron ride has been so successful in Shanghai.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:58.000
They are bringing it to Disney. It does look fucking awesome. I've watched the right, the, the, you know, I have never been to Disney world.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:10.000
I will go to Disney world when Tron ride happens, Bobby black Wolf. I know you'll be there too. When Trump ride happens, I'm going to find, I don't even think Bobby black Wolf does roller coasters, but I feel like he's going to do that one night.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:19.000
I feel like that'll be, that'll be the day he gets over it real fast, all that bad. I mean, it is, no, it doesn't go upside down or anything like that. It's, but you do have to lean forward. That's a little weird.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:31.000
It kind of just looks like the, uh, the radiator Springs racers kind of just amped up a little more. It's kind of what that looks is what the Tron ride looks like to me, but I'm fucking doing it.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Like I'm so, and I feel like maybe if that does like really fucking well and like it shows that there's interest and the merchandise sells and all that stuff, then people, cause you know, there's going to be all new merchandise and they opened up that right here.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:54.000
So that's, what's going to have to sell really crazy. I, I really don't understand. Like I get it. Like, let's not make Tron a movie or something like that, but they can do like the show was supposed to be pretty cool.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Like I watched like the first episode of the show cause I didn't have whatever Disney channel that was on and that was pretty awesome. No, I should really go and download the rest of that stuff. I should go find that somewhere.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:15.000
And Bobby Black Wolf confirms in chat. I will do this one. I love radio Springs racers, i.e. test track in Florida, which is the ride it's basically adapted from. So right. Yeah.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Yeah. I figured Bobby and his roller coaster, like he's going to, he's going to, there's exceptions to every rule and Tron will get around the world.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.000
I like what they did with California Screamin' now that it's the Incredicoaster. That looks pretty awesome.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Yeah. You know, I thought I'd be really pissed off about it, but it looks kind of fun.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:35.000
It's kind of neat. Yeah. I'm going to miss Neil Patrick Harris though as the voice on the ride, but that's it. Yeah.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:44.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundry Radio at vognetwork.com use the passphrase scale.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:52.000
All right. Anyhow, moving on. Let's talk about, let's talk about Sonic and more importantly, Sonic shitty friends. That's right.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:04.000
We have some more characters announced for team Sonic racing, such as memorable favorites from the series, including alligator guy, silver, silver, the hedgehog blaze, the cat and alligator guy.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:12.000
That's his name is actually King K rule. No, it's not. It's vector of the crocodile, but look at the car. Look at the car. He drives Loki. What is that?

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:20.000
That is a fucking Tron mobile. Actually. I believe that's a silver hedgehog's car. Cause I think, uh, I think, uh, alligator, I'm sorry.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Vector drives this little thing with the chompy thing. And then I think she drives that generic character. She drives that purple thing in the back.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:35.000
So this, this is look, he has little Tron discs in his arm. So silver, the hedgehog is like Tron as character.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Riddler. No. Anyway, sadly, no Danica Patrick announced yet, but those are the latest characters in supersonic race. No team Sonic racing. Sorry. Hopefully I'll have a catchy theme song.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Uh, if you were looking forward to the spiral remaster trilogy, I'm sorry to report it has been delayed is delayed back to November 13th. That is like two months back from the original plan date of September 21st.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Uh, apparently, uh, the developer has said it needed more love and care. So a delay was necessary. Uh, the quote says everyone here at toys for Bob is so proud to be reigniting the original spiral trilogy after all these years.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:29.000
We're deeply committed to getting these games, right? So we've decided to move the release date of spiral reignited trilogy to November 13th, 2018 more love and care.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:39.000
I will bet money. You know what that's code for? You know what that's code for? I'm a bet money on this failed certification, but they're not going to say it failed certification on one of the platforms.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:46.000
So now they have to put push it back as that. And that should, that they should take the time to get it right.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:52.000
But usually like when they're, when they're very fucking vague about why the game got failed certification.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Deb's tweet me and tell me I'm lying. Sorry. I tell me I'm lying at mr Rob Roberts tweet me and tell me I'm lying. Failed certification. Sorry to hear that. Hope you pass the next one.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:17.000
All right. It just, but it does make you kind of go, well, what fucking happened that it made it fail certification, but like the littlest, to be fair, the littlest thing can fuck it up.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Like if they, if they referred to the wrong button on the wrong console in one place, background color is wrong for our logo. It will, it will fuck flunk certification.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:38.000
All right. Uh, let's travel around the world and check out what's coming out in stores with some release dates. What we'll get to play a little sooner. The games that have passed certification.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Yes, this game has passed certification. Get ready, Sonic. Get ready, Mario, because there's now, oh, and I should also say get ready Sanrio because technically that's also a racing game.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Now you're going to have to compete against all star fruit racing coming to the Nintendo switch. I haven't been contacted about being in a game. Sorry.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Also for not an all star. I actually saw this on a coming soon banner thing that they had at GameStop today. So it's, what do you race is like banana and grapes. What is, what is it?

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:28.000
It is basically imagine like if you will, uh, what like, um, you know, in wreck it Ralph, there's the whole, you know, candy racing game there. Sugar rush.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:37.000
But imagine if sugar rush was designed by dentists and it was all about, you know, fruit. So it's sugar rush.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:49.000
But when they made the cookie monster start talking about vegetables, it's, it's, it's all, you know, it's all fruit cars now. So they're throwing like strawberries at each other.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Nine out of 10. Dennis approved a fruit racing. It looks cute. I don't know what the game looks like, but so it's not, it's not like, like the California raisins and the fruit of the loom annoying orange.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:20.000
It's not like actual fruit, right? It's just, yeah, like I'm looking at, I'm really, really quickly just kind of browsing. Um, what it looks like, it looks, looks decent. I mean, it's pretty, it, it's got, I don't know.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Yeah, no, no, no one. Eric asked game. No one here is getting this game next game. I'll get it on sale. Sure. Uh, anyways, so then the next game that we have coming a little bit more well known guacamelee too.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:43.000
That's coming out on PC and PlayStation four coming to the brand new Nintendo system. The super NES return of double dragon.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:53:02.000
It's coming to NES. Wait, like the actual like SNES according to this. Yeah. Okay. I'm supposed, I'm supposed to believe this. Sure. I don't know if that's actually legit, but maybe, um, but return double dragon coming out in the SNES.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Also this week we're finally getting the remasters of Shenmue one and two. Those are on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one. Um, as mentioned before gone home is coming out on the switch this week.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Also my hero one's justice that's coming out on the switch and PlayStation four. And finally, um, we have a C formula one 2018 coming out on PC places for Xbox one little dragons cafe on the switch and PlayStation four.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:40.000
And Rob, I know you've got to be excited about this coming to the Nintendo switch night trap, 25th anniversary edition. I'm kind of overnight trap at this point. Like it was funny.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Like the first time they're like, we're going to bring back night trap. I was like, Oh yeah, that game was so horrible. And now it's like, it was like the seventh time. It's like, guess what guys? Night traps coming back on the switch. I'm like, fuck off. We're done.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Now it's coming. I'm excited though. Cause not this week, but next week, donut country's coming out and that game I am all over.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Uh, chat on the double dragon thing, dark to see it says, don't forget return to double dragon is the Japanese improved version of super double dragon. I know I've brought it up before.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:25.000
I Rama says the same thing. Return of double dragons is direct version of super double dragon. So, uh, and Bobby black Wolfen chat pointing out night trap will never come out on a Nintendo system said Nintendo to Congress in 1992 under oath.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:39.000
They have lied. Arrest ready. Reggie fees may immediately, except he wasn't the one that said it. It was probably Howard Phillips who's probably enjoying retirement somewhere, you know, in the mountains of Seattle.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:54.000
So fucking the FBI kicks down his door for us. Stop it. All right. Times have changed. All right, let's travel to Japan and Bobby black will says arrest both Howard Phillips and Nestor.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Pin it on Nestor. That's, that's what to do. Pin it on them. I want to see before, you know, you know, eventually there's going to be, oh my God, that should be the smash character. They do that would be awesome.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:19.000
How would that, wouldn't you, I would lose my shit if that was like the last character they ever reveal was Nestor. That would be fucking bad ass. I'm sorry. Like you can take your Goku and shove it if we get no, no, no.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Even better. Like, you know how they always have like a mysterious villain. That's like the, you know, the big boss of the game or something like that. Yeah. Hidden shadows eventually become, you know, reveal that it's Nestor.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Oh my God. Was Nestor a thing in Japan or was that like only like is because the problem is if Nestor was not in Japan, which I don't know if Nintendo power even really was the thing over there, then I don't think it's going to happen before the animated super Mario brother movie, which will eventually get, I want to see a Howard and Nestor short.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Okay. All right. Can we travel to Japan? So we can travel in Japan. Let's check out the releases in Japan. Cause last week was kind of slow. This week it picks up again. We've got quite a few releases on the PlayStation four, including Boku no Hero Academia.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:08.000
One's Justice, Floral Flow Love comes out this week, as well as a game called Boku to Nersu no Kenshu Nishi in regular and premium edition.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:22.000
And Sayaku Naru Sayaku Ninjen ni Sasadgu comes out this week from Kemco and Gun Grave VR, the complete edition is out this week from XSeed as well as Conan Outcasts.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:34.000
And this game sounds interesting to me, Liar Princess and the Blind Prince. I've never, never heard of that game, but that could be interesting. So there is that coming out on the PlayStation four this week as well.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:51.000
On the Vita, Floral Flow Love and Koroshia to Strawberry comes out on the Vita cause the Vita still gets games in Japan. And then lastly on the Nintendo Switch this week, that same Liar Princess game as well as Boku no Hero Academia, One's Justice both out on the Switch this week.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Loki, would you shoot the UK for us?

01:56:53.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Yes. So there's a game coming out that you might have heard of, Shenmue 1 and 2. Those are going to be, of course, remastered on PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:11.000
A game that's called Mother Gun Ship. That's a fucking awesome name. It's a roguelike first person shooter shmup game. That's also on PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Formula One 2018. That's on PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC. A game called Punch Line coming to PlayStation four. And then finally, Warhammer 40K Inquisitor Martyr. And that's on Xbox one and PlayStation four.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Okay. Let's get to the mailbag because every week you send us email and we read it here. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place where you can send emails to us to read on the show.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:57.000
I'm reading these emails for a little bit while Jamie is out of the office for an extended period. Let's get to our first email tonight from Robert M who says, first of all, this is more for Jamie.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Well, too bad. She's not here, so it's for me. When I'm listening to the classic game of the week on most Mondays, I sometimes look on Wikipedia, one of a few websites or one of a few sites with gaming information not blocked at work for more information.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:17.000
And I'm generally disappointed to find that the online article pretty well matches up with what was discussed. Of course, I'm not accusing anyone of wrongdoing.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Nobody there is being paid for these pieces and nobody else's opinions are being presented as your own. Just presenting the source factual information, including critical reception.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:35.000
And yeah, we're not going to hide it. She uses Wikipedia as a source. A lot of us use Wikipedia as a source, but there's a lot of stuff that's interjected with our personal opinions and our stories as well.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:41.000
And, you know, a lot of the reason why these games are picked in the first place usually has to do with some type of memory or something.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:51.000
But it is an awfully convenient place where everything is kind of all in one place. And so, you know, that's oftentimes a go-to spot to get information.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Plot twist, I've done the same thing. My question is, what other sources does Jamie typically use besides Wikipedia and her own experience with the games?

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:07.000
I have seen other websites come up, especially for some of the more obscure stuff. I know Atariage has been used before for some of those classics.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:15.000
I know there are some games that have dedicated websites sometimes. I mean, they can be found with a simple Google search.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:21.000
If you go in and actually Google some of the other classic games, and usually these are things that are like, they were so obscure, they didn't even have a Wiki page.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Which has been some of the games that have been selected in the past. So, a lot of times there will be like, just like a fan website compilation of things that has been used before.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:42.000
But I know Atariage has been used as a resource before. And I want to say Game Facts came up once, too. I remember thinking that was an interesting source that was there, too.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Honestly, if a simple Google search brings it up, you can probably find some of the other same websites, honestly.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Dungeon Buster in Chat says, Wikipedia is as good as a springboard. The citations and links at the end of the articles often lead to more interesting places.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Exactly. I think that's a good way to look at it. Wikipedia is a good compilation. It's a springboard. But, you know, then that leads to the discussion on everything else about the game and the memories and so forth.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Moby Games. Thank you, ActDeaf. I think that's one that's come up as well, too, Moby Games.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Anyhow, continuing on with Robert M's email. And, of course, this might be more for Rama, but I really hope someone does a Cells at Work AMV to They Might Be Giants The Bloodmobile.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:33.000
I don't, that doesn't mean anything to me, so I'm hoping Rama gets that joke and will like LOL in chat or something like that. Anyway.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Robert M signs that email saying, also wants to see a skit where Rama Satome is splashed with water and turns into a sports car. So, maybe. Alright.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.000
I mean, that's kind of silly. That's a whole GoBots thing.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat suggests Emu Paradise. Oops, not anymore.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Well, no. They still have information about stuff. You just can't download the ROMs there.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Yeah. So, honestly, they would probably love it if you'd use them as a resource. Did you know what I learned this week? They follow me on Twitter.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:07.000
I've never, and I guess I follow them back, and I never really realized that until I started seeing all the tweets this week in my timeline.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:11.000
I was like, oh, I never realized I actually followed that website on Twitter.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Hi, guys. Does anyone want to come on the show? Anyway, one more email tonight from YYR.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:23.000
And, again, if you want to email us, and I think you should, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:30.000
By the way, Rama, answering your question in chat, Robert M., Rama says, actually, I do cells at work to Weird Al.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Calling in sick. Anyway.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Let's get to YYR's email. Second and last email tonight.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Hello, LR. Long time listener, long time email. Hurt derp.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:45.000
As I mentioned last week, I've been catching up on the episodes of OLR that I missed due to newbornitis.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:50.000
On the July 1st episode, Loki once again lamented that his kids keep asking for Nintendo Labo,

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.000
but that $70 is way too much to pay for cardboard.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:58.000
As a kid, I never saw myself growing up to one day defend inanimate pieces of cardboard, but here goes.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:02.000
I believe that this is akin to saying, why are video games in the store $60?

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Why am I paying $60 for a plastic disc?

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.000
The answer is that you're not paying for the plastic disc, you're paying for the experience that can be had with the disc,

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:12.000
and you're paying for the efforts of people who created said experience.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:17.000
I have no concept of the amount of effort that must have gone into engineering and testing the Nintendo Labo variety kit,

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
which allows you to build several different projects.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:25.000
But what I can tell you is that I bought one of these kits, and that during my teenage niece's recent visit,

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
she decided to build the Labo piano.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:32.000
I balked at the menu screen's proclamation that it would take approximately 150 to 210 minutes to build,

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
but she didn't. She jumped right in.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:40.000
The software gave her steps to follow one by one, specifically showing her what to punch out and where to fold every fold.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:41.000
I got tired and went to bed.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:46.000
When I woke up in the morning, there was a cardboard piano on our living room table with keys that actually pushed down,

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.000
and when you use the software's play mode, yes, it actually works.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Turns out it did take about three hours, and my niece had a lot of fun building it.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.000
So when you put your money down on Labo, you are not only getting cardboard,

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.000
you are also getting several hours' worth of the building experience.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000
When you are finished, you don't just have a cardboard piano,

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:06.000
you have a working cardboard piano that you actually built yourself and can be proud of.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Even if you choose to toss it afterwards, you'll probably remember and look back on that experience, which can't be thrown away.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:14.000
So I would recommend that you approach Labo like this.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Think of it as spending your money on the experience, not on the actual items contained in the box.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Although if you think about it, doesn't this apply to just about every video game we buy?

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:26.000
For the love of cardboard pianos, Aaron, YYR.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
That's a sweet story, YYR.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:33.000
I just don't see a similar story in my future, and that's why me personally, I'm not going to get Labo.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Do I understand why Labo is good for other people? Yes, I think it's great.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:43.000
But for me personally, I would build the piano, which, I mean, I guess you could say would be an experience,

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:47.000
but, I mean, building IKEA furniture is also an experience.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:51.000
A non-positive one if you have to do anything with their online customer service.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.000
If you want to guarantee Alan and I to fight, have us build IKEA furniture.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Any bang-up fight we've ever been in has been over building furniture.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Oh no, IKEA furniture building is fucking easy.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:04.000
I'm talking about dealing with their customer service department.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
Oh, no.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:11.000
If there's any knowledge that you can gain from this show today, it's this.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Never, ever order IKEA furniture through their online store.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:22.000
You can shop online, you can browse online, but you purchase that shit in the fucking store.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:27.000
You do not purchase it online, because they will fuck that shit up.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Okay, okay. Here's the thing though.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:34.000
And I think I'm pretty sure I said this about Labo when it first came out, if I didn't allow me to say it now.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:39.000
I would have ate this shit up if I was ten years old right now, and this stuff was coming out.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.000
This would have been completely up my alley, I would have loved it.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Now, I'm honestly looking at it going, this is just going to be shit in my house.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:51.000
And the thing is for me, that the games that they're coming, they're not really games.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
They're tech demos that use the cardboard.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Which again, for kids to be like, wow, this thing that I built is so cool.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
That's awesome, that's great.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:07.000
For me, the 40 year old different gamer in a different place in his life, I'm just going to be like,

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:10.000
woo, I built it, I pushed buttons, things happen, yay.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:13.000
I mean, is this keyboard mania? No. Is it a music? No.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:18.000
It's just a little piano experience, which I'm sure will be fun for five minutes.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.000
But for me, it's just not ultimately going to be worth $70 at the end of the day.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:25.000
And it's not that I don't think, well, I still think it's expensive.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:29.000
So I give it that for what it is. I still think it's expensive.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:33.000
Yeah, you can argue that there's dev time in there, but I, whatever, okay.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:39.000
For me though, it's I know my kids and I know my kids and how they do stuff.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:46.000
And we have so much in the way of Legos that they don't want to build them.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:49.000
They want to play with them and then they get bored with them immediately.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:56.000
And so if I buy this, I'm going to be building all the projects, which is fine because I like doing that kind of shit anyways.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:00.000
I will show it to them. They'll mess around with it for a little bit.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:05.000
They'll fight over something and then they'll go back to playing on their tablets because that's what they do.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Or they'll just play Mario Odyssey. Like every time we go into a GameStop, it's, oh, I want to play the Mario Odyssey demo.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:16.000
I'm like, you literally, I just literally took the switch away from you before we left.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:20.000
You were playing Mario Odyssey and you're going to play Mario Odyssey again.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:24.000
It's like, what the fuck? I mean, why are you guys fighting over this? We have this at home.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Stop it. I was like, I want to play Mario Kart, but we have it at home. You just got done playing with it at home.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.000
It's like, fucking do something and I'll play a different game.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:41.000
You know what, though? When I was younger, I would play Atari 2600 at home and then they would have the kiosk at the store and I would want to play Atari 2600 there.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Like, cause I, I picked up like,

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:47.000
But of course I would get to play different games on the, cause one of the stories you could flip between like 30 different games.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Cause I would pick up games that I thought my kids would like.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:57.000
Like I buy, you know, oh, hey, here's this Mario and Rabbids game, you know, cause they said, oh, I really want to get that game.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
I want to get some Mario game. I want to get it.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Fine. So I picked it.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Yeah. So I picked it up.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
How often does that game get played?

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Never. It never fucking gets played, you know, or it's just, they play the same thing.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
I'm going to die if I don't get that game.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:17.000
For some kids who like building and stuff, then yes, that would be perfect for them.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
My kids sadly are not like that.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:27.000
They're not like I was where I would sit quietly in the house and I would build stuff all day long with whatever I had in front of me.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:31.000
So the point is YYR, be thankful your niece doesn't have low-key seats.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:41.000
You'll know when your kids get older and you're like, and you're, you spend this money, like you buy them a trampoline and you're sick of your living room because you thought for some fucking reason that's going to be a great idea.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:46.000
And then they play with it for a while and you're like, Oh, look, it's so nice that they're enjoying something.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:50.000
And then they stop. And then it's like, it's like a cat.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:53.000
You buy the cat a bunch of toys and it wants to play in the box.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:57.000
And it's just, that's just kids and cats for you.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:03.000
I'm going to chat at live.voggenetwork.com. Tiger class says, I bet Loki acted like his kid when he was his age.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
I don't doubt that for a minute.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
I did not. I was not a fucking terror like this.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:10.000
I can ask my parents. I was quiet and I play.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Well, my wife says it's because she thinks I have Asperger's because, you know, of course, it's good.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
That was nice. Your wife to sell that.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
She tells me that all the time that I have Asperger's.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
OK, I don't want I don't want to make light of what I understand.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:29.000
But I'm just saying, because I am an introvert and I sit quietly and I will mess around with blocks or Legos or whatever for a long time.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:34.000
And if you if you think there's something there, talk to a doctor.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:37.000
I have. And they said, are you fucking crazy?

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:44.000
No, actually, they said that they don't know how to test adults, which doesn't make any sense considering I know adults that have been diagnosed.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
OK, whatever. Maybe you need a doctor. All right.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:50.000
I don't want to. This is a slippery slope because I know people.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:54.000
This is a very serious thing for it. I don't want to make light of it. Right. Yeah.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:09:03.000
So anyway, let's move on and talk about if you want to send an email, participate at orange launch radio dot com.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:11.000
If you want to send us an email at a later time. And again, I, I, I think that's great that Labo is doing for other people.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Oh, the one thing I want to say about the disk comparison, the new one looks neat. The new driving one.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Here's the thing about the disk, though. When I get a sixty dollar disk like Kingdom Hearts three,

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:24.000
I know I'm going to play that for hours and hours and hours because I'm going to get what I want out of that,

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:28.000
which is a fully realized, fleshed out story game adventure thing.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:35.000
I'm not getting like a tech demo, whereas Labo is kind of like tech demos and tech demos are cool for a minute.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:39.000
Yeah. Nintendo is pretty guilty of doing this like time and time again.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:45.000
Like, don't get me wrong, like I get it. We sports was a success and that was kind of a tech demo at the time.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:50.000
The show off, you know, the capabilities of the Wii, but you can't keep doing that shit over and over.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Like we play and we sports plus and this and that. You know, I get it.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:02.000
It's a neat idea. But what beyond the there's not like a deep gameplay there.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:09.000
It's just you build the thing, you mess around with it a little bit and it's supposed to like inspire me to create new things.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Cool, but not really. I don't know.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:18.000
All right. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Meanwhile, let's get back into some more gaming news. Loki.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:25.000
OK. And of course, sorry, of course, I have to plug the Skype line.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, if you want to give us a call a little later in the show.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:41.000
So let's talk about once again, this Philip Musen, who was the guy that plagiarized stuff on IGN and then got fired from IGN.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:50.000
We plagiarized his one reviewed Dead Cells. And then now he basically he went out on YouTube and.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Said, hey, you didn't really apologize for it and stuff and kind of like from what I understood,

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:06.000
just like kind of watching parts of it is kind of like, well, you know, this this has never really happened to me before, you know.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:18.000
So good luck finding anything that else out there that plagiarized into which people looked at everything and found dozens of things that he's plagiarized and his different reviews.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:25.000
And so because of that, IGN has actually gone back and they have removed all of his reviews from the site that he's done.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:31.000
So. I mean, that's definitely interesting.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Basically, you know, there's a long list, including there's a band to review that he took inspiration from Polygon.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:50.000
There was a video that he did on his channel that is basically reading expert excerpts from Wikipedia about Super Mario Odyssey and Shante Half Genie Hero.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Also, there's one that it was almost a word for word reading of a Neogaf post, even his LinkedIn as his resume is copied from a job template website.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:13.000
So kind of silly, but, you know, I guess there's a certain definite pattern of behavior.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:21.000
So. Is, of course, very.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:27.000
It makes sense that why IGN would have removed all of his content off the site, because God knows where it came from.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
God knows what else was plagiarism.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:36.000
I don't know, like there's a part of me that's like, you know, God, like, you know, the entire Internet is just dragging this guy.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:37.000
And I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:43.000
There's a part of me that kind of goes like, I wonder if he's like, sick.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:51.000
Like, I wonder if this is something where like this like copy pasting thing and taking credit for it is some sort of like there's like a deeper thing.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:57.000
You know, and again, I don't want to like make light of serious conditions for the second time here on the show.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:02.000
But I'm just like, there is definitely that part of me is like, I hope this, you know, like I it sucks this guy did it.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:07.000
And he deserved to not be writing for IGN because there are people that would have given everything to do that.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:10.000
And he took opportunities like I don't want to like, you know, pretend like any of that.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
But there's a part of me that says, you know what?

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Instead of continuing to like kick this guy when he's down, I just kind of like I hope he finds peace.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:22.000
I hope he's able to get to the bottom of why he felt this was OK for so long.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:31.000
And like, I just I just God, I hope I hope he's able to, I guess, to quote the old Tyra Banks thing I quote a million times on this show.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Learn something from this, I hope.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Well, I mean, I just sounds like he's been doing this for a while.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:41.000
So, I mean, he's probably figured, well, it's worked for me so far.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:46.000
It's just that and it could I mean, I don't know, maybe he doesn't really think he's doing anything wrong.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Like he's like, well, I'm just phrasing things in a similar way or I'm you know, but I don't know.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:58.000
But if that was the case, then like there'd be a lot of people accusing other articles of, you know.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:02.000
I know, I was like in games journalism, though, like for real, for real.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Like we just talked about how the whole like classic Game of the Week thing is like kind of inspired by Wikipedia.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Now, here's the thing. I've never claimed to report news here on this show.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:15.000
We discuss news. And so, yes, of course, we use a lot of various.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Yeah, we're not publishing information on a Web site.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Exactly. No, we're bringing some of the table and talking about it, you know, and that whole thing is what we're doing.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:28.000
And like honestly, guys, like I would say 90 percent of podcasts you're listening to are probably doing a very, very, very similar thing.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.000
And we're certainly hiring writers.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Yeah, we're the writers, you know, but the whole thing is free. Right.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:43.000
So but anyway, my point with it all is like, honestly, since we do see so many different gaming Web sites with so many different topics and so forth,

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:49.000
like we also see like how many times is the same line just kind of run over and over on all these different sites?

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Like people have straight up made up lies to see how far it goes and how many Web sites kind of copy paste the same thing,

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:01.000
or how many Web sites will just take the press release and massage a few words here, a few words there.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:05.000
And that's the article that they publish. Like, you know what I mean?

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:12.000
I think where things got into a really sticky situation with this is that this went beyond news.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:20.000
This went to opinion. That was the big no-no is that when it came to reviews and opinion, you can't copy.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:25.000
It's one thing to regurgitate the news. You can't just regurgitate somebody's opinion.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:29.000
You know what I mean? Like when I give you an opinion on games, that is my fucking opinion.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:35.000
I might say I might reference like I was reading some people on the Internet saying this or I saw an article on such and such that said this.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
You know, I might kind of throw that out there.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:47.000
I can see where there might be some overlap if, like, for example, say there was like with the reviews, sometimes they'll give you information about the game, like where they're talking about different systems and whatnot.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:51.000
They may have like bullet points describing the different systems in the game.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:58.000
And maybe they will read both of them read off the same, you know, thing and didn't really make it their own that well.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:05.000
But I don't think for the average YouTube reviewer, probably not the case.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:08.000
I don't know. I just.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:13.000
I think if that was the case, well, it would have been like, well, actually, you know, it wasn't copied from here.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:18.000
It was reading off of this piece of, you know, this press release that I received with the review copy of this.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:23.000
And so this is where I got my wording from, not this YouTube or something like that.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:27.000
But that wasn't the case. It was just I didn't copy.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:31.000
That was just a weird fluke. We just happen to use the same type of language.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
Good luck finding more shit.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
All right. Let's move on to another story.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:39.000
And I'm going to read this word for word from VG 24 seven dot com.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:43.000
A new report has come out suggesting that Nintendo is working on a port.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:47.000
OK, no, I'm not going to read a word for word. Here's where the story is going.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:51.000
They, of course, like half the Wii U games have become switch games.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Right. So what's the latest one they're talking about now?

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:58.000
New Super Mario Brothers U on the Wii U is the one that they're talking about getting moved over to the switch.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:05.000
This is from a journalist named Liam Robertson, who I guess has this track record where it's like some of the things.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:12.000
He's basically like when he reads the tea leaves, he reads them right, you know, majority of the time.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
So that's where this is coming from.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:20.000
He wrote this all in an article for Comic Book talking about sources that Nintendo of Europe

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:26.000
and other sources that he's not naming that have corroborated this information throughout the year.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:32.000
This game, when it comes out, it's going to include the Luigi add on as they were doing on the Wii U towards the end of that.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:35.000
You know, they were selling that as a bundle pack anyway.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:39.000
So we don't know when it's going to be released.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:43.000
The port could be this year is something that they're suggesting there.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
I don't know why they wouldn't have announced that.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:51.000
But it would also maybe lend something to why Nintendo keeps saying we have more that we haven't unveiled yet for this year.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Wink, wink, no judge.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:18:00.000
But okay, there's also a part of me with this where it's like, okay, the new Super Mario Brothers Wii U and all that was a good game.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:03.000
It's cool, but like, why not Mario Maker?

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:04.000
Yeah.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Why not give us all of the Mario in Mario Maker, which I think was a stronger Wii U title because you could make all this stuff.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Why not do that on the Switch? Why this?

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:18.000
I don't get it. I think that would be a lot easier.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:24.000
Mario Maker with additional content. Oh, and then we have Super Mario Brothers 2.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Or maybe one of the Game Boy games.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Because I don't know how well two would blend with the others.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
I'd like to put some things from two in there, maybe.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Okay, you know what? Do this. If you can't get an actual skin, do a Wario skin.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Where now it's Wario and everything looks funky like a WarioWare type of thing.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:46.000
It's all hand drawn or something. They could come up with something that would be silly and appropriate.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:49.000
So I would like to see that.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:55.000
And if the release is only $20 in digital or something, then that might be cool too.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:06.000
I wonder if, I'm gonna throw something else out there, maybe part of the reason they're hanging on to this is that maybe with this new version you can play with your friends online.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:09.000
Because it was four player all in the same room.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:16.000
So there's my little guess is that maybe the new twist is you can play with four players online.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:20.000
And so that's why they're revisiting this and why it hasn't been released yet.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
It's part of their big online thing.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:25.000
I'm throwing a crazy tip for Hatton.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:30.000
This is just not a game that I would be like, oh my god, I need to play this online. I don't know.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:31.000
It's just...

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:32.000
No.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Thank you for the validation.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Dartitsia says, oh Rob may be onto something.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:43.000
I kind of think if we're going down this road, that's where this might end up.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
And for the record, that's not in the original article.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
That is my prediction.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:52.000
My own tea leaf reading there is that that might be the spin that they put on it to make it different.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Is that now instead of playing all in the same room, you can play across the internet.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:59.000
Of course, I would think Mario Party would be the game to do that with.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:03.000
But we know we're getting a Mario Party that has some kind of online functionality.

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
Or Mario Maker with two player mode.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:10.000
I would love Mario Maker, but maybe this is the precursor to that. Who knows? I don't know.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:11.000
We'll see.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
Alright, Mega Man X...

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Oh, my Zelda Maker!

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Mega Man X400 in chat says, online, great, but without voice chat? Kind of lame.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Well, Nintendo's got an app for you, my friend.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:28.000
You've probably never used it, because you have no reason to use it when you have Discord.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:31.000
But did you know, Nintendo has an app, my friend.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:34.000
And all your voice chat can be done through the app.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:38.000
I still don't fucking get that. Especially when, was it Fortnite?

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
Voice chat through the console?

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:41.000
I know.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:44.000
It's like, we can't do it. It's physically not possible.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Wait, what about that?

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
Uhhhh, fuck.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:51.000
Alright. Let's move on, Loki.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:55.000
I don't fucking get it. I don't understand.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:02.000
This is exciting news, and I know it seems like every few years we read something about time splitters,

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:05.000
and I'm like, woo, new time splitters! But then nothing ever happens.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:08.000
And that's, you know, unfortunate.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:11.000
But at least this might mean something.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:18.000
So THQ Nordic has acquired the licenses for, or the IP for time splitters and second sight.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:27.000
And they announced, I guess, that was made through Kotch Media, which is a subsidiary of THQ Nordic.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:35.000
Time splitters, of course, was considered one of the most influential console games of the early 2000s.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:39.000
And then second sight, it was a science fiction action adventure game.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:45.000
I never played second sight, but time splitters, I played all three of those games, and they are fucking amazing.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:53.000
So, not sure what's coming with those, but I want more time splitters.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:56.000
I'm down for that, whenever that happens.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Yeah, I think a lot of people are really waiting for a new entry in that series.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:08.000
I mean, the pandemic was working out for a while. Now, I need it.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:13.000
It's so funny to me how THQ goes under, now they're back because somebody else took the name,

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:18.000
and now all these old franchises are coming back. It's kind of interesting how that all goes full circle.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Alright, well, I know some of you all are very happy to see Double Dare back on TV.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
Do you watch that with your kids, the new Double Dare?

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:26.000
No, I don't. Cable.

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:29.000
Uh oh, I guess that makes sense. I guess a lot of people don't in this day and age.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:32.000
Well, the new Double Dare apparently is pretty good. A lot of people are enjoying it.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:35.000
I haven't really watched it either. I'm just, you know, I'm kind of in your boat.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
I don't really ever watch Cable anymore.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:42.000
But, some people are also exploring the love of Double Dare through a new Facebook game.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:47.000
Hey, remember that whole chat about Facebook Messenger really trying to push the game thing?

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Well, now they've got an agreement where they've got Double Dare on Facebook Messenger.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:58.000
So, you can challenge friends and keep track of who is winning on a leaderboard inside the game.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:03.000
If you go to Facebook Messenger and do games, you type Double Dare, you can, I guess, find it there.

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:06.000
I guess it's already there. You answer Double Dare questions.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:10.000
You can compete in physical challenge mini games. I have no idea how that works.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Does that use AR or something like that? Or do you have to, like, use the video somehow?

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
I don't know. It sounds a little shady, but whatever.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
So, I haven't seen how that works yet.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:23.000
So, I can't imagine you have a giant nose in your house that you have to search through to get the flag.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:26.000
So, I guess they must have to get creative with some things like that.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:31.000
Anyway, the play is one-on-one, but you can play it within a group chat if you want.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:35.000
So, anywhere. Anyway, if you want to check that out, it is within Facebook Messenger.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:42.000
I just kind of think it's neat that they have this newer property that people are into right now with Double Dare coming back.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:46.000
Even though, again, I don't get how it plays like the real show.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:51.000
But, hey, game shows as games, I think are, you know what?

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:55.000
So much of what I used to play on Commodore 64 were game show games.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:24:00.000
Family Feud, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy, Card Sharks.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:04.000
Like, all those games had Commodore 64 versions.

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:07.000
Most of them had Nintendo versions, too.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:11.000
So, game shows always make good adaptations into games, usually.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Yeah, they had a PC game for Double Dare at Commodore 64.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:19.000
Back in the day, yeah, they did. Back in the day, they sure did.

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:22.000
I don't think it's, you know, certainly they haven't made one in a long time.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
I think there was a Double Dare game on the NES.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
I might be wrong, but I think there was one there.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:30.000
And then, of course, then you got games that are like game shows,

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:34.000
but anticipation was always super game show-y to me.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Even though, I guess it was really more of a board game,

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:40.000
but it kind of felt like the presentation was very much like a game show.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:43.000
Man, I miss that game. Why don't they make games like Anticipation anymore?

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Of course, if you play Anticipation enough, you just kind of have all the drawings memorized.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:50.000
You start to see two lines, you're like, oh, house. Oh, hammer.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
You know what they all are.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
All right, anyhow, just a few more stories for you guys.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:58.000
This is in the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:01.000
All right, so this is unfortunate news,

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:05.000
but apparently one of the voice actors of the Pokémon series,

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:08.000
the voice of Professor Oak, has died.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:12.000
So, voice actor Unsho Isazuka.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:18.000
I've been voicing him, I guess, since 1997.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:22.000
And, yeah, he passed away, unfortunately.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:26.000
He did a lot more than just Professor Oak,

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:29.000
but I think that's where a lot of gamer people are going to know him from.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
Right, yeah.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:34.000
But, yeah, that's unfortunate, though,

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:37.000
because he's like a main character of the show.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:38.000
Sure, sure.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
And he wasn't all that old.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:46.000
I mean, 68 or 67, I think, yeah, 68 was what he was when he passed away

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:49.000
due to esophageal cancer.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
Ah, that sucks.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Especially when cancer gets, you know, we were talking earlier in the show

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
about, like, Satoru Iwata, and, you know, how, you know,

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:59.000
we were talking about the whole Smash Brothers moral quandary or whatever,

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:00.000
but, you know, he was very young when he passed,

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:03.000
and that was cancer-related, wasn't it, if I remember right?

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:04.000
Yeah, so.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:07.000
And then, of course, we just lost Aretha Franklin this past week, you know.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:08.000
She was a little bit old.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
She was the same age as my mom when she passed,

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
and my mom didn't pass from cancer,

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:16.000
but as we all know, Aretha Franklin did, and that's, you know, also very tragic.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:20.000
So, all right, anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to be a downer,

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:23.000
but, you know, we have to pay our respects.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
And, yes, I agree with the chat room is lighting up with,

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
cancer sucks, fuck cancer.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
Absolutely. Agreed. Fuck cancer.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:32.000
All right, one more story for you guys.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:36.000
This is a very kind of atypical sort of report on a new game that's coming out,

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:40.000
but I just, I thought this was a very neat sort of thing for gaming,

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:44.000
and it has to do with, like, charitable stuff in a game,

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:47.000
but this game also kind of takes it one step further.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:51.000
Like, for example, Hellblade, Senua's Sacrifice, you know,

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:56.000
that game did very well, and Ninja Theory actually donated proceeds

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:59.000
from that game on World Mental Health Day.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:02.000
They donated all the proceeds at the sale of that game,

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:07.000
and they also donated another $25,000 when it got to the $50,000 threshold on Xbox One.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:10.000
And then there's a game called I Hope, which was a cancer treatment game,

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
speaking of fuck cancer.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.000
This game, I Hope, donates the proceeds to children's cancer treatment and research.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:20.000
So now we have a new game coming out from Delve Interactive

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:27.000
that's a game about homelessness that will donate a portion of the proceeds to homeless charities.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:33.000
The game is called Change, and in Change, you actually play as a homeless individual

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:38.000
on the streets of a city, and the city is actually procedurally generated,

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:42.000
basically meaning that, you know, it's going to be infinite, I suppose.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:46.000
The skills that you have and the dog that keep you company

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
will be the only things that you have in the game.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
You will have to battle the elements.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:54.000
You have to improve on skills that will let you improve the situation,

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.000
and the narrative in the game is also procedurally generated

02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:00.000
so that your playthroughs will not be the same.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:03.000
This is all coming from a three-person development team,

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:07.000
and they're drawing from their experience of nearly being homeless in their own shoes

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
when they were developing the game Poncho,

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
and so that's kind of the inspiration for the game.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:15.000
They've also promised they will donate 20% of what the game makes

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:21.000
to a UK-based charity called Crysis that wants to end homelessness in our lifetime.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:26.000
So I did think this was just... I just really liked the concept.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:33.000
I mean, obviously, I think homelessness is a very, very tricky situation

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:36.000
that is hard for many people to deal with and so forth,

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:42.000
but I think it's really neat when a video game can kind of put you in those shoes

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:46.000
to think about that, to think about maybe why some of these charities

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
maybe need the money and so forth,

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:53.000
and I think that's just a really neat way that video games can kind of be expressive

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:56.000
when we get into this whole debate about are video games art or what's the whole deal?

02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:01.000
I think this is a really neat expression using video games

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
to kind of put these feelings that these guys felt

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:06.000
when they were almost homeless themselves into a game and some of those challenges,

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:09.000
and then trying to do some real good from that.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:14.000
I think with all the horrible stuff we read about with video games sometimes,

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:17.000
I thought this was just a really nice thing to read about.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:23.000
Anyway, if you want to check this out, you can on Steam Early Access on September 18th.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:28.000
They are also planning to release for iPad perhaps mobile devices as well.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:32.000
That is where the game is being scheduled to be released,

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:33.000
so you can check that out.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:36.000
So you can now give us a call if you'd like.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:40.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:44.000
The Skype line is open for you to give us a call.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:49.000
Go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:53.000
Some folks sharing their stories with cancer and why it pisses them off,

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:56.000
and yeah, it's horrible.

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
All right, we've got some calls coming in. Let's get to it.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
And then I'll ask you for last minute stories as well, Loki.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Hey, this is Regineer.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:05.000
Hey, what's on your mind tonight, Regineer?

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
No, a whole lot.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:18.000
Since you were talking about Steam and all that earlier in the show,

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:22.000
I would like to pose a question to you.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:23.000
Okay.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:31.000
Well, everyone knows the whole back story to me and to PC Gaming,

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
so I won't bother retelling it now.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
It'll be too long-winded.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:40.000
But with that story being said,

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:52.000
have there been any platforms or games that you heard

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:58.000
other people hype up for the longest time?

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:01.000
And you said, you know, what's the big deal?

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:02.000
I won't bother.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Then you finally break down.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:07.000
Why the hell did I not get into this earlier?

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Yes, yes.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
An answer immediately jumped in my head.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:14.000
The Sega Dreamcast, easily.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
When the Sega Dreamcast was new,

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
all these people were super into it,

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:21.000
and I was like, but Sega systems, they're never...

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
And this is a good thing Jamie isn't here,

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
because she'd read me up and down for this,

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
but this is how I used to feel and not how I feel now.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:30.000
I used to be like, oh, Sega systems are not nearly as good

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
as the Nintendo and the other stuff that comes out.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
Sega Dreamcast is going to blow, whatever.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:37.000
And then finally I pick one up and I was like, oh, my God, I'm an idiot.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:40.000
These games are fucking amazing, and the system deserves to do better.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:44.000
I think a lot of people kind of misread the Dreamcast,

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:50.000
and that's part of the reason why it just didn't do as good as it deserved to.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:54.000
I mean, we joke that it was ahead of its time, but it kind of was.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:57.000
And some folks in chat agreeing with me there, Dungeon Busters saying,

02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:00.000
yay, Dreamcast, Act F saying, yep, the Sega Dreamcast for me too.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:03.000
I feel bad for the Dreamcast in that aspect. It was an amazing system.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:07.000
Loki, do you feel similar, or is there a different thing that jumps to your mind

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
when we talk about platforms?

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Yeah, I guess the Dreamcast, I don't know.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
I wasn't really into the Dreamcast,

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:20.000
but then I got into it way later, when it was over.

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:24.000
You know what else I didn't like at first, Rage Nator? This might surprise you.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:27.000
The other system I didn't like at first? The Nintendo 64.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:28.000
Oh, really?

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Yeah, when I first played it, I didn't get the hype with Mario.

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:36.000
In fact, kind of to this day, I still think Mario 64 might be a little bit overrated,

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:39.000
but okay, some people remember it fondly and so forth,

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:43.000
and I do love Mario Odyssey, so its roots are definitely in Mario 64.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:49.000
But at the time, I was like, it's all blocky, and why does everything have to be 3D?

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
Why are they shoving 3D down our throats?

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Maybe that was just me being an old man at the age of 18, or whenever the Nintendo 64 came out.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:00.000
But that was a system I didn't really grow to appreciate until later on too,

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:06.000
because I didn't buy a Nintendo 64 until I got a big one that looked like Pikachu

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:10.000
that the lights lit up when you turned it on. It was really fucking adorable.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:14.000
Yeah, here's the thing with the Nintendo 64.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:22.000
I got mine in April of 1997 because I came into a little bit of money,

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:29.000
and when I got that money, the first thing I got was the Nintendo 64,

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:33.000
because up until that point, I had been a Nintendo fanboy in hell.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:40.000
I have nothing against the system, and Nintendo as a whole, great company and all that,

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:48.000
but if I were to be nitpicky at all, it's the fact that during the system's lifespan,

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:54.000
the really top-notch quality games were very slow to trickle out,

02:33:54.000 --> 02:34:02.000
and not only that, but if you compare the multiplatform games at the time,

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:10.000
the N64 games were considerably more expensive than, say, the PlayStation 1 versions.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:15.000
Right, with the cartridge versus disc was a huge thing that kind of came up years later,

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:20.000
may have been a misstep for Nintendo, but some still swear by the Nintendo 64, so eh.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:24.000
What about, Ray Jander, if I were to flip this question on you, what would have been your answer?

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:35.000
Well, I'm not really answering the question outright, but in fact I'll change up the question a little bit.

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:38.000
How dare you answer the question?

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:47.000
Well, there's one thing that I kind of regret not buying. It was the Sega Saturn.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:58.000
If only because, you know, at the same time I was buying the N64, and like two weeks later I got the PlayStation 1.

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:11.000
I also saw the Sega Saturn at a kiosk at what was my local Toys R Us, and they were showing off Panzer Dragoon.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:19.000
I thought, oh my god, this game is gorgeous. I can only afford two systems. I already got the N64.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:26.000
Do I get the PlayStation 1 or do I get the Saturn? Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:30.000
So we all slept on Sega is the moral of the story.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Basically, yeah.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:35.000
All right. Ray Jander, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
All right, have a good one.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Take care, my friend. Bye bye.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to get through.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:45.000
Tell us about how you misunderstood Sega or yell at it.

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:50.000
As a Sega fanboy, here's your opportunity to call in and say, god damn you all, I was right this whole time.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:53.000
And be the gaming hipster you know you want to be.

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
Loki, any last minute stories we're going to get to?

02:35:55.000 --> 02:36:01.000
Yeah, let's talk about the whole PlayStation live streaming.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:07.000
So live from PlayStation, they have a big source where you can view different game shares and stuff like that.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Also pornography, because apparently people are somehow getting pornography into that live from PlayStation.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:18.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I remember when the system was first out it had this problem because...

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:23.000
No, but this is different though. This isn't people filming themselves in front of the PlayStation.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:28.000
I miss the days of playroom streams and the random fucking shit that would happen.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:35.000
It's not that, which is weird because they did have where you could film your own talk shows and stuff.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:40.000
They have effects you could trigger through your phone. They could do that.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:43.000
Well, Twitch has an IRL channel and a talk show channel.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:48.000
If we wanted to do this show on Twitch, we could do that very easily.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:51.000
But no, this is somehow, and I don't understand how they're doing it though,

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:55.000
because it shows a picture of Mafia 3. This is the game where it's from.

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:59.000
But then it's literally an image from the internet.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:06.000
I don't know if they are playing Mafia 3 and somehow go to the internet browser and pull up porn and then do a screen share.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:09.000
And then it captures it as Mafia 3 or something.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Weird.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:13.000
But somehow porn is getting into there.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:22.000
And the story came out because this guy, basically his kids were looking for gameplay footage from Overcooked 2.

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:25.000
And so they were searching for Overcooked 2 gameplay footage.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
Something was definitely in the oven too long.

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
And then instead they got lesbian porn.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:34.000
Actually that's not lesbian porn, that's just regular porn.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:37.000
And naked women.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
Because curation.

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:40.000
I see.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:41.000
This is like the Steam platform.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:42.000
I see.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:46.000
This is the precursor of what we're going to expect in Steam.

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:47.000
Pornography.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:52.000
So that was on Sony's little thing.

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
And Sony's like, they're live from Playstation.

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
It's basically the sharing.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
You know how you can see the Playstation share feeds or whatever.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
I wonder how they did that where they got the screen.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:05.000
Because you can only get listed in that if you are streaming from your Playstation.

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:08.000
You can't get listed by going on Twitch and doing that.

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:11.000
But I guess you can post actual pictures too.

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
You know how you can share photos and stuff.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:16.000
But it says right here, it says Mafia 3.

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
It says don't report, I am just trying to bring some fun.

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:21.000
And it's like a picture of some Playboy model.

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
Don't report.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:27.000
I love it.

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:30.000
So I'm not sure how they're doing it, but it's being done.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
Alright, last chance to get in you guys.

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:35.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
Anything else to share with us, Loki?

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:41.000
Well, not yet, but there's a whole...

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:48.000
I don't try to get into NeoGaf drama, but there's NeoGaf drama regarding Patrick...

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
I thought everybody went to a new one now.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
No, no, no, they're back.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:59.000
But Patrick Klepek, I guess, he's a games journalist who is now coming after somebody in esports.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:03.000
You know this is the end of the fucking show and we're scraping the bottom of the barrel.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
This is the bottom of the barrel.

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:10.000
We looked through the barrel of news and we found some crap on the bottom.

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:11.000
Half-eaten sandwich.

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:18.000
So they're basically dredging up old photos from him in college where he's being very misogynistic and shit.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
This is the day and age where we are now.

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Where if you don't like somebody, you just dig into their social media history until you find some dirt on them and then expose it.

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Maybe people should quit enabling those people.

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:35.000
Have you ever considered not enabling those people that like to dig back 10, 15 years?

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:38.000
Didn't I get into this just last week on OLR when we were talking about the OLR archive?

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:39.000
Yeah, I don't get it either.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:43.000
I'm like, I probably said something shitty 15 years ago that I wouldn't say today.

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:47.000
So I'm going to just kind of put that out there now.

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:54.000
But the problem is though is, and we see this like even with like Disney where they fired, you know, James Gunn and stuff that companies will take this serious.

02:39:54.000 --> 02:40:03.000
And they're thinking, well, we want them to get fired from his company because how dare you say something that we don't like you saying about somebody.

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:07.000
And so you should lose your job for that because I hate you.

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:12.000
I mean, it's stupid. It's the fuck. It's stupid.

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:18.000
This is close to home for something that I know a lot of people going through a situation right now.

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:24.000
And I'm just like, when are people going to blame these enablers, the people that enable these sick people?

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:27.000
It's because these people are all anonymous. It's because they're all anonymous.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
Because if they were actual like people.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:32.000
Stop enabling bully campaigns. Stop it.

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
That's all I have to say.

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Let's see. Orange Laundry, all one word on Skype. Last chance to get through.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
I don't know if anybody else is going to get through.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
But some comments in chat at live.vognetwork.com.

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:47.000
SJ100Matt says, I think we would live happier lives if we stayed off social media.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:50.000
True. But then it's like, but what about all the good things Twitter has done?

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:55.000
Which is, I say that very tongue in cheek. Like I really, really do think that Jack needs to not be in charge of Twitter anymore.

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:59.000
He's a bad CEO. He's bad for the company. He needs to leave Twitter.

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:04.000
But I'm not going to just leave Twitter without something else to fall back on.

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
I'm sorry. Mastodon is not that place.

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Mastodon, I want to like Mastodon. It's too, it's too all over the place.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
It's too hard to explain to other people.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:19.000
The thing about Twitter, it's super fucking easy and you get it on your phone.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:22.000
That's the thing. And I have so many great connections on Twitter.

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:25.000
And people that I talk to on Twitter that I like don't want to lose that.

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:31.000
But I've been so tempted to be like, I'm not coming back to this fucking place until you ban the Nazi accounts and you get rid of Jack.

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:35.000
Like, but I can't do it. There's too many people I'm too close with on Twitter.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:38.000
And we have nowhere else to go.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:47.000
And that's apparently I think this. So according to this thread I'm reading here, apparently their porn is a collectible in Mafia three.

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:54.000
I don't know if it's necessarily the image that they're showing on here, but apparently some of these Playboy images are parts.

02:41:54.000 --> 02:42:03.000
It could be a collectible item in the game. Although what I'm seeing now, I think that's vintage Playboy, at least not Mafia three stuff.

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:10.000
MXC in chat says Discord is taking Twitter's place for me as a means to chat with my friends and people with similar interests.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:17.000
That's a very interesting thought on that is that maybe I just need to invite all my Twitter friends into like a Discord place.

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
I don't know. Anyway.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:22.000
All right. Well, we do have a VoG network Discord. There's lots of rad people there.

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:27.000
Maybe not all my Twitter people, but VoGnetwork.com slash Discord.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:30.000
If you want to talk to me on Discord, that's a great place to find me.

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:34.000
And there's no Orange Lawn Radio channel. A lot of awesome people share stories there throughout the week.

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:40.000
Once in a while I'll reply. Many times I'll just respond with the Mr. Smoosh emote icon that Bobby Black Wolf put in there for me.

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:47.000
I think he did that. It would either have been him or Darktitsu. I'm pretty sure that's a Bobby thing where he put the Mr. Smoosh.

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:51.000
And so I just react to everything with Mr. Smoosh. Happy news, Mr. Smoosh. Sad news, Mr. Smoosh.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:59.000
So if I react with Mr. Smoosh, you at least know that I read and I had a reaction to your story that was appropriate.

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:08.000
Yes, Bobby Black Wolf says I also put my Wolfie logo in there. I think it's funny because technically we have that little orange thing that my ex from 2002 made.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:12.000
That little vector orange looking thing that was in the old OLR logo. Technically we have that.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:18.000
And I guess we have the Xbox Live pixel art thing that you did years ago that actually was on Xbox for a short time.

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:25.000
You can't get it anymore, but you could get it. The little OLR logo. If you look at my gamer profile on Xbox, I'm never going to get rid of it.

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:35.000
So, you know, they'll have to take it from my profile. So there's that. So we do have our own little logos, but I do love that it's like, okay, we got the Bobby Black Wolf and we got Mr. Smoosh.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:39.000
It's like the OLR logo. I'm actually okay with that.

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:42.000
I'm not saying that as a read. I'm okay with it, actually.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
Oh, I should see if they have scoozy stuff on them.

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:50.000
Yeah, you want to buy some more ferrets? All right. That's it. We're going to be done here on the Skype line because nobody else is calling.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:55.000
But you can always send us an email. Participate at Orange Launch Radio is the place to send us an email.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Hey, thanks you guys for tuning into another episode of Orange Launch Radio. We appreciate it.

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:04.000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:11.000
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here, how are we to spread the word?

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:14.000
So definitely help us in telling a friend or two about the show.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:21.000
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this podcast would go an awful long way as well.

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:27.000
We really appreciate all of those. So that's going to about wrap it up, but not until I get final thoughts.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:34.000
Loki, thank you for holding down the fort with me still while we feel the absence of Dark Sakura for a little bit longer here.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:41.000
But it's always fun to sit here and listen to you get louder and louder over the craziest things like fruit this week and fruit raising.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:53.000
My final thought is I'm going to hopefully work on game development again because I stopped working on that space shooter one.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:58.000
So I have like I literally have like a dozen projects that I want to work on.

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:04.000
And that one wasn't quite it's just too involved what I want to do with it.

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:10.000
And so I kind of step back from that right now because I just didn't want to do it right now.

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:17.000
And this is more exciting. So I'm going to go with this and we'll see. I may go back to it. I jump around.

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
So that's it.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:22.000
All right. And my final thought tonight is, yeah.

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
Def is asking, is there going to be a post-show stream?

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:29.000
I don't I don't think there is going to be one tonight, but I'll probably get to one during the week.

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
I'm trying to think of like what to play on stream.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:36.000
So if you guys have ideas like maybe there's just an RPG I really need to play through.

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:40.000
I thought about maybe restarting Kingdom Hearts and streaming some of that because, you know, Kingdom Hearts three is coming out.

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:43.000
And damned if I remember the old games at all.

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:49.000
So there's a I was like, maybe I'll just get a copy of the Kingdom Hearts redo and play through some of that.

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:52.000
I need to play through the whole thing, but I don't have that kind of time to set aside to.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:46:00.000
Yeah, I do want to play Skyrim completely modded the fuck out and broken.

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
But I think people have done that. And that's kind of I don't know.

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
I don't know what people would want to watch me play.

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:09.000
And it's also hard because I don't really have a place that I can record like that for.

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:13.000
Well, one, my game recording hardware.

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:18.000
Somebody has I think I think Jamie has it now.

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
Jamie has it now. OK, well, Jamie.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
Where's the Flaco Flaco had it.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:25.000
I don't know if Jamie has it now. Somebody has it.

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
Somebody has it. It's I hate to say it, though.

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:33.000
But at this point, it's kind of dated technology because the lag is going to be really big on that.

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:38.000
That's the only problem. So at this point, you might want to just write off your loss and get something that's a little more like current.

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Yeah, I wasn't expensive about that. Like, yeah. Years ago. Yeah.

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:47.000
So but I don't have the setup and I don't have like I'd have to go out into the garage and do it.

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:52.000
And I just don't have the setup for that. I hear you. I hear you. All right.

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:56.000
We're out of here for tonight, though. Thank you guys so much for listening to Orange Lawns Radio.

02:46:56.000 --> 02:47:02.000
Have a great week. We'll see you here in seven days. We will be back in seven days and then we'll be off for a couple of weeks.

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:07.000
So be here next week. I'll see. I'm also trying to get some guests here to join us in studio.

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:12.000
So look forward to that. I'm going to try to get somebody here next week. So have a great night, everybody. Bye.

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:20.000
