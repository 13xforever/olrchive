Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight, Nintendo pioneered the ability to make people buy the same games all over again, but now they've been officially recognized for these feats on the second round of NES Classic Production. Flashback to the 1980s and join us for this along with the rest of the night's gaming news starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:53.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on August the 5th of 2018, episode number 740 of our show. Here over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. Myself, Rob Roberts, joined by DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
I'm arguing with my sum tables on numbers.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Are you spreadsheet warring?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I am spreadsheeting right now.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I see.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Because I have to track how much money I spend.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Don't they do full on games in Excel? Isn't that like a thing people do?

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
I know people do like Perler and knit patterns in Excel.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
Oh, that makes a lot of sense actually to do like Perler patterns in Excel. Actually, our show role that lists all the stories we're going to do.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Oh, okay.

01:19.000 --> 01:27.000
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense though because Excel is great for like grids. Although, technically, I don't use Excel to do the show role. I use that open office.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
On my Mac it's numbers, on my PC it's open office.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
So, there you go. Spreadsheets.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Except when people give me word for free or office for free.

01:38.000 --> 01:50.000
No, I was doing my budget because I have to put what I spent in there, but I've used spreadsheets plenty of times with my collection to do our personal inventory at home, which we need to do a new one.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
Especially now that we have pinballs to add to it, which we have a new pinball.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Congrats. What'd you get?

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
The Shadow.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Oh, wow. Like the Alec Baldwin movie from 94 or whatever?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Tim Curry.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Oh, that's right. Tim Curry was in that.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Tim Curry is on our pinball.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
That's right. Oh, your pinball's been blessed.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
But it's also a really interestingly built table.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
Because it has like this upper section that you use like bumpers to get all these little targets.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
I forgot what they call it. I've only seen that movie like once.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
But anyway, that's our new table and we just gave back Whirlwind that we were borrowing for attorney.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Oh, I do like Whirlwind too though, but I understand.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
Whirlwind had that little fan at the top that like when you get the bonus mode or whatever, it like blows air on you.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
When you're in like some stinky, sweaty bar, like that thing feels really good.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
You know what I mean? Because I think they had a Whirlwind.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
There's this random bar in the Castro. I think Moby Dick's. You know the place I'm talking about, right?

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
I haven't been to Moby Dick's, but I know it.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
I think they had it.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Yeah.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
And that was one of the things.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
You know what would make sense for them to have?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Huh?

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
A Fish Tales.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
I know one of those bars in Castro had an Elvira table, which is very appropriate.

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
Now the Bolt, the leather bar in Sacramento, for those who don't know, has a Simpsons pinball party.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Oh, that's right. They do. That's right.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Pinball at bars. Fun. But I mean, that's kind of.

03:11.000 --> 03:18.000
Not only can you play pinball, but you can see people getting fucked in the ass.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Well, no. Last time I was there, they had porn up on the TV.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Wow. Dark Sakura. Wow.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
This is a show about video games. You take your filth elsewhere.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
I'm just saying, last time I was there, that's what I saw on the TV.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
I need somebody pure and wholesome to clean up this mess that Dark Sakura's leaving.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
So say hello to Techmaster Loki.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Hello.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Hi, Loki. How are you?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Good.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Did you go to church today?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
No.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Well, how are you doing?

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
I'm doing fine.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
Yeah, what's new with you? Hopefully less bars and CD stories than what Dark Sakura's talking about.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Right.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Yeah.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
I've been still working through my Unreal stuff, so I'm pretty much done with the lesson that I was on.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
So are you doing the Cooking with Unity learnings?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Sorry, it's like a code-along. It's a Udemy course.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Oh, a code-along. Okay.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Type of thing.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Yeah.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
But the guy, he makes mistakes, and I usually catch him when he makes them.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
But that's like the best way to learn.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
But yeah, it is. And then I like how he kind of also gives different instructions.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
Like, okay, we've done this a couple times. Now I'm going to challenge you. Go do this.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
And then he'll pause the video and go build this part out.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
And then you're done. And then you unpause it, and you make sure you did everything correct.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
And that seems to be pretty effective.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
Plus, I also went through and tweaked some things, and I've even been commenting on the course.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
Because I just got done with the audio portion of it, and he has a background track that plays.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
Well, the way he triggered is, when basically the level starts, it plays the track.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Right.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
But it doesn't loop it. So I'm like, well, you can do it this way, and it will loop it every time.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Interesting. So you're trying to one-up the teacher. No, I get it.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
Well, I'm just suggesting that, and not to mention the track he made for the background.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Does it loop well, but hey, whatever.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Alright.

05:14.000 --> 05:22.000
It's just what it is. It's just a really basic get to know Unreal thing.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
And I've gotten to know Unreal.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Alright.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
I just got an immediate announcement alert from Dan.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Oh boy, what?

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
A dude in the top eight is using Yamcha.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
Okay, so I'm okay with this transition and your random interjection here.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Because I actually want to talk about Evo here at the top of the show.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Because obviously the Evo tournament is going on in Vegas right now.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Mandalay Bay is where they do that.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
So Evo's happening right now.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Our buddy Alex is there.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Yeah, I know. I have a friend that's there too.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Actually, I know a few people that are there.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
Good old Rob D from back in the All Games days.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
I'm seeing his stuff on Facebook. He's there right now.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
So anyhow, Evo's happening.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
I must admit, I haven't been watching a lot of it, though I have been following some of the drama.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
But you've been watching some of it, right, Jamie? What have you guys been watching?

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
We watched a few of the matches, like last night, when we couldn't get any sleep.

06:12.000 --> 06:19.000
We were watching the Dragon Ball FighterZ play, watching some very interesting people.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
This one guy busted out Ten Shinhan and was fucking kicking ass.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
I mean, all these guys were like, Brawley, perfect sell. Brawley, perfect sell.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
Dude busts out Ten Shinhan and owns. I'm like, yes!

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Did you see some of the drama going on with Smash?

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
Oh man, the Smash Brothers stuff is pretty interesting because it came down to a Bayonetta versus Bayonetta fight.

06:44.000 --> 06:51.000
And I guess some of the crowd is not super into that because I think some people feel Bayonetta is overpowered because of some of her combos and what have you.

06:51.000 --> 06:57.000
So again, you will have to excuse me, fighting game fans and Smash community fans.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
I'm not as up and up on what's going on, but I'm just kind of getting the cliff notes.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
So apparently the crowd was booing what was going on.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
But there was some interesting stuff that was happening with the contestants as well.

07:08.000 --> 07:15.000
I don't know if it was because of the booing or what, but when one of the matches started, and this was like the finals, the final match.

07:15.000 --> 07:21.000
They just stood there for like a minute and they didn't fight because the crowd was booing.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
And so finally somebody came over and was like, you guys need to play.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
And so they played, but there was something really interesting that happened.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
One of the guys kind of accidentally fell or he lost his life falling off the edge.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
It was like an accident, he wasn't supposed to do it.

07:35.000 --> 07:42.000
So what happened is the other player just jumped off the ledge and traded life for life.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
Which in the finals of a competitive thing, what in the heck?

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
That sportsmanship.

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
It is, but it's also like some people actually are viewing the stalemate that they were doing.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
One of the guys flipped off the crowd as he walked off the stage.

07:56.000 --> 08:03.000
They're seeing that as kind of like, basically kind of like everybody all around is being really immature.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
Now to be fair, the contestants I believe are 16 and 17.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
So I'll cut them some slack on the maturity because by definition they're not fully matured yet.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
So that's fine, but the audience, like I know there's a lot of adults in the audience.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
That's some bullshit.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
And they need to like, I know.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
You didn't get your way.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Or wah, Bayonetta is overpowered.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
Well, I mean, then don't show up.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I don't know what to tell you.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
Surely there is a character that counters Bayonetta.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Surely.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
And again, I don't know my smash as well.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
I agree, and don't call me Shirley.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
But there must be a character that counters Bayonetta pretty effectively that you would pick

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
and maybe is not otherwise a stellar pick.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
But if you wanted to take out a Bayonetta, you could do it.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
I don't know.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Anyway.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
Well, at any rate, Dan just messages me because he was like, I want to see someone in the top eight using Yamcha.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Well, someone's in the top eight using Yamcha.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
We'll go into the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
where of course we do tape live at VOG Network every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
And we do get some live comments.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Tigerclaw says the Smash Brothers community can be toxic.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
SG100Matt says the whole community was shitty last night.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Tigerclaw says if you can't counter Bayonetta, you suck at Smash Brothers.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
It's as simple as that.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
But as SG100Matt points out, there isn't a counter.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
That's part of the problem.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
And well, here's the thing.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
I don't want to blame an entire community

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
because I know people in the Smash Brothers community that are fucking awesome.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
So I don't want to be all like the entire community is...

09:40.000 --> 09:46.000
I'm not going to do that, but I am going to say that display of the community was poopy.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
And so y'all need to have a come to Jesus moment and like figure out why...

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Y'all need Satan.

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
You need to figure out why that's okay to like boo children.

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
I'm sorry, but 16 and 17 is still a child by legal definition.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Why it is okay to boo children.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
And on top of that, I'm hearing shit about like death threats and shit

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
because of course we live in a social media era.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Of course.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
You're sending death threats because they play the character you didn't like.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Oh my God.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
How fucking cool are you sending death threats to a 16 year old?

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Like, oh my God.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Can I have your babies now?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Where can I fuck this person?

10:27.000 --> 10:33.000
So obviously heavy sense of sarcasm I hope is clearly coming through.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
None of this is acceptable.

10:35.000 --> 10:42.000
So we need the decent Smash Brothers people to like kick those other people out.

10:42.000 --> 10:48.000
But to be fair, this is a problem that is not unique to Smash Brothers.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
This is a problem we have in the gaming community that's a little bigger than this.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
I don't know if we can answer this on a three hour show,

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
but it is going to take the less shitty people to stand up and say,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Hey, stop being shitty.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
That's just how these sorts of problems get fixed.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
You have to call out.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
I mean, this goes, this goes for a lot of different things in life.

11:09.000 --> 11:15.000
Like, um, I don't want to get too deep, but the reality is when it comes to things like racism.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Okay.

11:16.000 --> 11:25.000
Like it takes a unshitty non racist person to really stand out and call out the behavior of somebody who's being racist by saying,

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Hey, you're being racist and that sucks.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
And if you keep doing that, I'm not going to be your friend.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
It takes that to like counter that.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Or as in wonder shows him that's racist.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Sure.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Well, you know what?

11:37.000 --> 11:45.000
Sometimes if you're at a bar and you see or out in public and you see a woman being harassed by some guy, you stand with her.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Yeah.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
I mean, and that is so.

11:47.000 --> 11:57.000
So honestly, the only reason I bring it up and go to that, like really like heavy place is because like this sort of behavior is not even necessarily unique to gaming culture,

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
although sadly it runs rampant in gaming culture.

11:59.000 --> 12:08.000
But like this is, this is a society problem that has to be stopped, solved by less shitty people sticking up for people who are marginalized.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
Standing up to it takes the kind of fortitude that takes some development.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Yes.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
Anyway, a tire con chat says that, you know, this is going to continue with super smash brothers ultimate.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
You know, these people will find something to bitch about.

12:20.000 --> 12:27.000
Like then like don't throw, throw them out of the arena at Evo, throw them out.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Why are they there?

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
If they're going to sit there and boo and they're not enjoying it, then fucking get out.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Leave.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Nobody forced you to go to Vegas.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
I'm sorry, but the stinky cunt gets the douche.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
I'm in that kind of mood.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Why?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Why are you doing this tonight?

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
Because I'm in that kind of mood.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
If they're going to be...

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
You can say that.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
I can't.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
If I said that, I get angry.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
I get death threat tweets.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
You can say that.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
If they're going to be cunty, then treat them.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Actually, douches are bad for you.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
So honestly, I think it is the worst insult.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
Call someone a douche because douches are bad for you.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Oh my God.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
If any episode ever deserved the explicit tag.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
All right.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Anyhow, let's talk about...

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
I'm making up for your Blender on Bobby by making us worse.

13:19.000 --> 13:25.000
Let's talk about some of the less explicit things coming out of EVO because there is

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
a lot of news happening.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Playing as Panda.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Okay.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
In Tekken 7.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Oh, the competitor that was doing that?

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
The Panda was so cute against Devil Jin.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
It was so cute.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
The Devil Jin guy won, but the Panda player did pretty freaking well.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Yeah.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
All the Tekken 7 hype and all the stuff that's happening around that at EVO and everything

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
is kind of reminding me like, oh yeah, Tekken 7 is supposed to be really good.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
I need to pick that up at some point.

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
So I think I probably will because like many of you, I loved Tekken 1, 2, 3, and then kind

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
of maybe I looked at 4 and I kind of lost sight of the series.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
So I need to come back to it with Tekken 7, which just before we went live tonight, apparently

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
they dropped a bombshell on season 2 characters for Tekken 7 and Anna is going to be there

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
because you have to have Anna.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Come on.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
You have to have Anna.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Negan from The Walking Dead is like their next big crossover, which is...

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Yeah, I know.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I don't watch Walking Dead, so I have no idea what that is.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
I don't watch Walking Dead.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
I don't watch Walking Dead.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
He's the antagonist that carries the bat with the spikes on it.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
Oh, played by, um, what's his face that played the dad on Supernatural.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Yes.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Jeffrey Dean Anderson.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Yeah, that's it.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
So, him.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
And the comedian.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Yes.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Is that the guy from Everybody Loves Raymond?

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
No, I don't think he's from Everybody Loves Raymond, no.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Or was he?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
I don't know.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
I just remember him from Supernatural.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Look up his bio.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Jeffrey Dean Morgan.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Now he's the brother from Everybody Loves Raymond.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
I don't know which character he is in Walking Dead because I didn't get to watch that show

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
because my wife didn't want to watch The Walking Dead.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
She didn't want to watch, you know, Breaking Bad.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
She wanted to watch House again.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
My mother watches Walking Dead.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
She wants me to watch it.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Or Grey's Anatomy again.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
Or God whatever other awful show.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Here's the thing.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
I don't watch it because A, it's on on Sunday nights and there's-

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
B, Netflix exists.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Yeah, something else going on.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
It's too violent for me is my honest answer.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
You guys know how I feel about the gore of violent stuff.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
Like when it's cartoony video game Mortal Kombat 2.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
It's funny and I can deal with it.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Or like the Happy Tree Friends and stuff.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Even that's a bit much sometimes.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
That should be a crossover character for Mortal Kombat.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
I can deal with it.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
But like the new Mortal Kombats that are like super realistic.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
I'm like this is-

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Oh my God.

15:31.000 --> 15:37.000
Now I really want a Happy Tree Friends fighting game in the style of the latest Mortal Kombat game where it's just ultra violent.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Wasn't there a Happy Tree Friends game years ago?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
I thought there was.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
I could be wrong.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
That was years ago.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Anyway, I don't even think that's a thing anymore.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Anyway, other news out of EVO.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
Let's see, DLC character Terry Bogard for fighting EX.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
Which is going to be a character in there.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Aria and Sharon teased.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
Volcano Rosso and Pullum Perna are coming out between August and September.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I know none of these characters unfortunately.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
I don't follow this series at all.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
I probably should because I've always had a soft spot for like the stuff that came from SNK and Neo Geo back in the day.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
And obviously that's where that all comes from.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Soul Calibur 6.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Now this is more my speed.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
I love the Soul Calibur series.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
Astaroth and Song Minah are announced that are going to be in the game.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Why don't they just say all the old characters are coming back?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Because I feel like every week we have an announcement.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
How many games has Maxie died in?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Probably all of them.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
But the soul is eternal.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
He still has the voice actor he had in the original Soul Calibur 2.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Anyway, I'm super excited about Soul Calibur 6.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
I'll be checking that out for sure.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
There is a new Guilty Gear game being made.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
That is something that was announced as well.

16:45.000 --> 16:51.000
DOA 6 teased some reveals that are coming up for Gamescom.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
But unfortunately they did not announce anything.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
There is thought that during the show later tonight.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
So maybe we'll have some breaking news in part B.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
Capcom may tease some Street Fighter 5 stuff.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
But that would not happen until the top 8.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
That is I believe what is happening at EVO right now.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Is the Street Fighter 5 stuff.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
So we may hear about that mid-show at some point.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
So that would be cool.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
Okay, so I did recognize him from Grey's Anatomy unfortunately.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
One of those shows your wife made you one.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
I was like...

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
But he does look very much like...

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
There is a comedian that looks kind of like him too.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
That was the brother in...

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Everybody Loves Raymond.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Yeah.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
No worries.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
There is an update for Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Edition.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
That has just hit the Switch.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
And if you want to play Dragon Ball FighterZ on Switch.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
The open beta is next week.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
And SNK Heroines is going to feature a female Terry Bogard.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Which is pretty cool.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
So kind of like some gender swapping there.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
But you know we've kind of seen that in some other games before.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
So that will be...

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Yes and he is much hotter as a female.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
It depends on what you're into.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
But sure.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Alright.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
So anyway.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
Lots of talk about fighting games this weekend because of EVO.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
What was the last fighting game you got into?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Loki?

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
You don't really play a lot of fighting games do you?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Last fighting game I played? Jeez.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
What about you guys in chat?

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
What was the last fighting game you super got into?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
I don't know.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
I'd probably say on my arcade cabinet I was playing Marvel vs. Capcom 2.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
I mean I didn't really get into like any fighting games like a lot.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
Yeah that was probably the last one.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
I mean.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I may have played.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
No I don't know if I played Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
I did want that one though.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
You know what I wish they would release like on Switch.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Or one of these like collection type of things.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Maybe it's been out.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Or Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
I did play that on the Wii.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Did you?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Yeah that game was pretty cool.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
I want them to bring back Capcom vs. SNK 2.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
And I imagine it's like a licensing nightmare.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Which is why that won't happen.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
But that's like one of my all time favorite fighting games.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
But I feel like that's a game I want on Switch.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
That I'll probably be waiting forever.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
For something like that.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
But that's like one of my all time favorite fighting games.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Is Capcom SNK 2.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
So.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Yeah that was pretty good.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
And then let's see.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
I get into the Soul Calibur series.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
So I'll be excited with Soul Calibur 6.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Or I did try to get into Mugen a little bit.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
But.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Oh yeah that was the thing you were.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
That was like betting wasn't it?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Well salty bet.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Yeah that was fun.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
But no actually.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
The problem with Mugen is like.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Balancing.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
I mean I guess you just don't give a shit about balance.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
It's just like.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Throw everybody in there and balance.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Whatever.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
There's no fucking way this is ever going to be balanced.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
But I kind of wanted to get into that.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
But more.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
You know actually balance it out.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
But yeah it's just.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
It's just too much.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
It's too overwhelming when you see all the options.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
It's like I don't know who to put in my roster.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
It's too many.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Too many people.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
It's like.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
I'll put all the fighting.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
All of them.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
All of the characters.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Every single one of them.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
Probably the last fighting game I probably played like more than a couple hours of.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Like recently was actually Street Fighter 4.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Like that game kind of still delivers.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Because it's.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
It's everywhere.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Like remember Street Fighter 4 was a launch title on the 3DS.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Remember that.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
I have it on my cabinet.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Yeah.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
But then obviously you know it keeps.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
They put it out on PlayStation Plus or something not that long ago.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
One of those.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
The Xbox Gold or something.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
So and then it's you know.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
It's very easy to find a copy of Street Fighter 4.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
And that is a very solid fighter.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
So I would say that's what it is.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I didn't put that on the Switch.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Yeah that is kind of surprising that doesn't exist on Switch.

20:19.000 --> 20:25.000
Maybe they have like some exclusive deal right now with console exclusives for Street Fighter as a whole franchise.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
Well no because that Switch just got that massive collection that we just mentioned.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
With the Street Fighter 3 and the alpha and you know that whole bundle.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Yeah.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
About 4.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
SJ100Matt is talking about FighterZ.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
It was a game he got into recently.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
I played online and stopped playing.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
People are just insanely tough on there.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
Bonds006 says I played me some Marvel vs. Capcom 2 before I came home.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
But SJ100Matt points out Capcom vs. SNK 2 is also up there.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
Jamie I didn't really get your opinion on this.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
What's like a fighting game series you've recently been into.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
Like a fighting game series you like follow, watch or that you've played a lot of.

21:07.000 --> 21:13.000
Because I feel like you probably have collectively played more fighting games than the two of us.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Just with your history.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
I was really into Tekken for a long time when I started working at that Amco arcade.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Tekken 3 was my jam.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Tekken 4 I was really into.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Tekken 5 I was really into.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Tekken Tag not so much.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Yeah Tekken was really the big one for me for a while.

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
And then I was also really into like Darkstalkers.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Oh sure.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Yeah really into Darkstalkers.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
You know that makes me think of Puzzle Fighter.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
And even though I guess Puzzle Fighter is something that is represented at EVO.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
EVO is not just like the big fighting games that everybody knows.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
But I guess EVO has a lot of tournaments for a lot of little stuff too.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
Like I guess they have the Windjammers because that recently came back right.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
So they have a Windjammers tournament there.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
But they have a Puzzle Fighter tournament that happens at EVO.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
And that is more up my alley.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Like Puzzle Fighter that's a fun game.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Is that Pocket Fighter?

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
I'm sure they do but I don't know.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
I wish Puzzle Fighter would come back.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
And yes I'm well aware of the iPhone Android game.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
So I'm going to go back to what I said.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
I wish Puzzle Fighter would come back.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
I wish that they would do.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
Would bring Red Earth out which I knew that that ship has sailed because that should have been Saturn era.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
But I'd like to see like a sequel to Red Earth.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
I thought you want Arrival Schools.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
I really want Arrival Schools.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
That was my other jam.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Yeah.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
I even posted on my Twitter the other day that I still want Arrival Schools game.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
You know those are my big things.

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
And you know Dan and I played a lot of X-Men vs Street Fighter because we had it on Saturn.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Nice.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
And then Marvel Super Heroes vs Street Fighter we had that.

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
Is there anything like recent like some of the recent batches that you've gotten into or do you kind of nothing beats the 2D classics?

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I finally got to play Dragon Ball FighterZ.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Oh what did you think?

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
I really liked it.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
It was a little difficult to get used to the moves.

23:04.000 --> 23:10.000
And we're actually even though I have it on Steam I'm going to get the one of the console releases.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I just have to figure out which one we want to get.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
If I get it on Switch I'll have to get another pro controller I guess.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
It was really a lot of fun.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Yeah.

23:19.000 --> 23:28.000
And but I really think that my big fighting game enthusiasm kind of died out after Marvel vs Capcom 2.

23:28.000 --> 23:34.000
Well you know I honestly like the Dreamcast was like the fighting game console for me.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
That was like all the best 2D fighting games were on the freaking Dreamcast.

23:38.000 --> 23:44.000
And I didn't even I didn't even buy Dreamcast until like Sega had already canned it and they were down to like forty dollars.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
But then it's like I went back and rediscovered all these amazing games.

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
And even not just the 2D stuff but that's where like Soul Edge was a Dreamcast thing right.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
So you know like.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
So like Vons006 says Darkstalkers is the new Half Life.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
And I was like except there was a third Darkstalkers.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Darkstalkers did get to three yes.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
We have Vampire Savior.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
All right.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
All right well fighting games is fun but I know we play a lot more than just fighting games.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
And let's talk about the other games that we have been playing in your gaming week.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
So Darkstalker how was your gaming week?

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
It was pretty dead.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I've had a really busy week because I'm in training at work.

24:19.000 --> 24:25.000
So I don't know I read the WoW wiki and I read the Injustice 2 wiki.

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
To the point that I think Dan and I might have to pick up Injustice speaking of fighting games.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Except I hate DC.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
Like none of the characters really interest me but that game really interests me.

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
Injustice is pretty like the cool thing about Injustice is that it's Mortal Kombat basically.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
But it's not that violent stuff that I was talking about.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
It's instead it's superheroes.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
And it has a story.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
You know I understand there's a DC versus Marvel thing.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
I don't get as into that argument and I love Batman.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
So you know there's always going to be some of the stuff in DC that I'm like into.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
It's like a new Marvel fighting game.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
I think Injustice is a solid franchise.

25:01.000 --> 25:06.000
Yeah it doesn't matter how you feel about comic books and stuff.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Like a good game is still a good game.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
I like all the character interactions though.

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000
And also that game has my favorite ever version of Harley Quinn.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Because she's still herself but she's moved on.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Yeah.

25:19.000 --> 25:25.000
And really I mean it's just been a lot of pinball lately because we just got the shadow.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
And I've been perusing a few things on Steam.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
But I haven't really played anything yet.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
I need to get my stream setup done.

25:35.000 --> 25:40.000
I was trying to say I need to get my streaming stuff set up.

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
So I've been slacking.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
It's been a busy week.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Sure. It happens.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
All right. Loki how about you? How was your gaming week?

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
I didn't play a whole lot of games because I've been working on programming.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
So I did play.

25:55.000 --> 26:02.000
Well my son's birthday was this week so we bought him a gaming laptop for his birthday.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Probably a big mistake but whatever.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
So he has been playing games on there so I did while setting it up.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
Check it out because I haven't played it surprisingly enough.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Octodad.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Oh yeah.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
That game is hilarious.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
So we got to play a little bit of that.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
But it's basically setting up Minecraft and stuff for him with mods and everything.

26:21.000 --> 26:28.000
Man Minecraft and mods have really come before I remember trying to get controller support in Minecraft.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
It was a pain in the ass.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Now they just have a mod that works with them.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
Like jeez this is fucking easier than it was when I had to do this.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
So that's kind of cool.

26:37.000 --> 26:43.000
But really didn't play a whole lot other than Pokemon Go this week just because I can't get access to my TV.

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
My brand new 4K TV and my PlayStation Pro.

26:48.000 --> 26:55.000
And my brand new copy of Horizon Zero Dawn that's literally had two minutes worth of playtime on it.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
So sad.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
So I haven't been playing any console games unfortunately.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
I did install more Steam games because why not?

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
Let's make that library bigger of stuff I'm never going to play.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
But I had a bunch of stuff like I was digging through my Humble Bundle library.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Because I was like well I need to get some keys to my son.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Because I gave him a Steam account.

27:16.000 --> 27:22.000
And I was like okay well I'm just going to offload all these duplicate keys that I have.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Which I have like 50 duplicate keys.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
It's fucking ridiculous.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
So I was going through that and I'm like wait a second.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
This is stuff I haven't read.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
I remember purchasing this and I didn't ever redeem it.

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
So I've been going through that and just adding this to my library since I'm like up to like 560.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
Maybe I'll play a game. I'll pick a game to play and just play through it.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
You should do that.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Especially when you're on a video gaming podcast.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Playing some games is good.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
But whatever.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
You know what? My motivation was I need to finish a fucking game.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
So everybody can stop saying fake the fucking game.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
I was going to, if you would let me finish my sentence before you.

27:58.000 --> 28:03.000
I was going to say but I know you've been spending a lot of time trying to get back into Unity to write games.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
Well I'm in. I've kind of left Unity. I'm back in Unreal now.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Oh sorry. But still.

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
You're working on the thing that everybody criticizes you about.

28:12.000 --> 28:17.000
So I suppose you could be given some credit there.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
But play some more games.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
I want to play more games.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Alright.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Anyway.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Let's see my gaming week.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
To be fair. I haven't played a lot of new games.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
Because the game I've been still playing most of this week.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
No Man's Sky with the reboot.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
That's exactly it. I want to go back to that too.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
Yeah. And honestly. I probably streamed that game like three times this week.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
And been continuing my adventures in No Man's Sky.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Learned a lot about multiplayer.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
With how the weird syncing works.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Because I don't think it does server syncing.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
I think it's like peer to peer.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
Because the only way I was able to see Bobby's base finally.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
Which he built on the same planet that I built my base.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
He just built it like across the river.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Is that the only way we could do that.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Is that he started a game.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
I joined his game.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
We met on the planet.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
And then I could see the base.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
And then it stayed.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
And actually. Bobby doesn't know this part.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
It did stay behind.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
So that when I played off stream.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
And I went back to his base.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
I got the trophy for visiting a base.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Basically alone.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
It's weird though that you would think that we would just update.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
It's just like it hasn't refreshed.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
Yeah. But there's no server talk or something.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
But there should be. All that's supposed to be persistent.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Well. Here's the thing.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
I think maybe the game is very popular right now with the reboot.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
And I think a lot of that's struggling.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Because I notice.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Like every time I play the game.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
The little icon for naming services.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Always is like naming services are offline.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Like it's always offline.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
So I think the things that I'm naming.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Don't get out there.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
I didn't want to name this shitty planet anyway.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Exactly.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Well the funny thing that happened on one stream.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
And there's a clip of it over my Twitch channel.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Rob Roberts.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
The funny thing that happened on a stream that really made me lose my shit.

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
There was a planet that was like really icy and frozen.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
And so I was just joking like.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Oh well I'm going to name this planet Madonna.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Because it's frozen.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Because it's heart's not open. Get it?

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
So I tried to name the planet Madonna.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
And as soon as I hit enter for Madonna.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
It came up.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Profanity filter.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
This name has been rejected by the profanity filter.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Madonna is a profane word.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
I can't.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
I can't name the planet.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
I'm like who made this game?

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Lady Gaga?

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Like what is.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Why can't I name a planet Madonna?

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
So I had to name it.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
The second rate Madonna.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Venus Delight.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Which like two listeners will understand that joke.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
So anyway.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
It wouldn't take Madonna.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Now I wonder if it's because Madonna.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
I mean to be fair.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Does have biblical connotations to it.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
But still.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
I just found that very weird.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
That it was in the.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
It could be something like that.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Or it could be a phonetic filter.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
It could be like you know maybe.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Is Madonna a curse word in another language?

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
Maybe there's like.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
I don't know.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
Eh.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Go to Madonna.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Is that a.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
I don't know.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Curse in another language.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
I don't know.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Anyway.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Tiger Claw says.

30:57.000 --> 31:03.000
Maybe the game is preventing you to name planets as celebrities.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
It isn't doing a very good job because I have.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Let's see.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
I have.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
I have planetary systems named Aisha Tyler.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Beth Ditto.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
We stan Robin.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
I.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
There's plenty of.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
I have a planet named Vangie.

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
I'm sure there's probably like 5,000 planets named Miss Vangie or Vangie or some connotation

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
of.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
But you better believe I have a planet named Vangie out there.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
So I mean you could name things after celebrities.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
Madonna is the first one where it said nope.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Oh I don't know.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
Bobby Blackwolf trying to give some insight to what's going on saying.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
It's persistent to new players.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
But once you've already visited a planet.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
It doesn't try to get new information.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Hmm.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Interesting.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
So it's like it downloads the planet the first time you go.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
But then once you kind of like have your own version of it.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
It doesn't keep trying to grab it from the server.

31:50.000 --> 31:55.000
Which might be part of how they try to reduce strain on the server since we're not exactly

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
playing.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Or paying a monthly fee to.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
To play the game online or anything.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
But I don't know.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
Yeah whatever.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Yeah.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
I mean it's not.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
It's not deal breaking for me because.

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
I kind of feel that multiplayer is sort of limited anyway.

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
Like the night that Bobby and I were kind of screwing around on stream and Dungeon Buster

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
was there too.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
And we were like looking at stuff on the planet like that was fun.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
But I don't think you could really play the whole game that way.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Like I'm not sure that would really work.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
Like now we're at a point where like Bobby's kind of at one point in the story.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
I'm at one point in the story.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
And it's cool that we have this place to converge.

32:29.000 --> 32:34.000
And that's what I like is that oh we have this world where we both have bases so we

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
can kind of you know.

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
But I actually I used Bobby's base to hide from Sentinels.

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
Because just on the other side of the hill from Bobby there was some stuff I was mining.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Some hydrogen crystals or something.

32:45.000 --> 32:50.000
And I actually mined so much of it because I have a new multi-tool that does it fast.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
So I mined so much of it that it pissed off the Sentinel.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
And I was like oh crap.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
And so it's like follow me follow me.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
So I ran into Bobby's base and it finally.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
The worst fucking part of that game is the stupid fucking Sentinels.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
I hate that shit.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Yeah.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Well you can kill them.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
But it just.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
It'll rate.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Yeah but then it lets.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
You know.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
But there's a lot of quests.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.300
Clean up until you get like super death Sentinels or whatever.

33:11.300 --> 33:14.000
There's a lot of quests that.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
I want you to kill Sentinels.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
Bobby Blackwell says someone on Reddit tried to name planet Madonna a year ago.

33:21.000 --> 33:25.600
Well I'm sure I'm sure I'm not the first person in history to try to name something Madonna

33:25.600 --> 33:30.840
no man's sky like you know there's other 40 year old gay guys that play this game I'm

33:30.840 --> 33:31.840
sure.

33:31.840 --> 33:37.000
But still like it's just it's the first time I heard of it.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
I'm doing something that has nothing to do with video games tomorrow.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
Uh dare I ask what is it worthy of mentioning on this show or.

33:44.000 --> 33:49.000
Yeah I'm going to see Sailor Moon Super subtitled in the theater tomorrow night.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Huh.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
That's awesome.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
I still haven't seen the Mamma Mia sequel I'm upset.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
And Transformers the movie is going to be playing.

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
I my wife saw the sequel she said it wasn't that great.

34:00.000 --> 34:05.000
I don't always agree with your wife though no no no offense but I don't always agree

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
with her opinion on movies and TV and stuff so I'm going to see it anyway.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
It doesn't matter like you literally have 20 people tell me it's fucking garbage.

34:12.000 --> 34:17.000
She and I'm still going to go see she watched that movie room on Netflix yesterday.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
Not the room but room totally different right.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
No the one that got nominated for Oscar.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
Yes I don't know.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Anyway so that was no man's sky.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
And then otherwise I've also been continue to play Pokemon Go.

34:33.000 --> 34:38.000
I'm two thirds of the way through level 38 now so I have six million XP to go before

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
I'm capped in Pokemon Go.

34:40.000 --> 34:45.000
So the friends thing has been great for XP even though I'm really bad at sending you

34:45.000 --> 34:50.000
receiving gifts when I do do it and I've really been trying to get my gifts out there when

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
I do do it like I've been I've been hitting 10000 XP bonuses like left and right because

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
I'm getting up to two stars with people and now I'm starting to hit three stars with some

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
people like I hit three stars with you this week Loki right.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Yeah that was actually right after the show.

35:01.000 --> 35:07.000
That was 50000 XP dark soccer and I are like we were probably going to hit it today like

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
that that it's hard to tell because it doesn't give you a numerical representation of how

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
far along you are.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Yes you can.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Oh how.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
So go into your friends thing.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
I'm doing this right now.

35:18.000 --> 35:23.000
So go into your friends and then go to whatever friend you want to look at.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
OK.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
Well I got to launch my game.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
You keep talking.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
I'll do this.

35:27.000 --> 35:32.000
Go whatever friend you look at you tap on the icon that shows the little circles and

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
I'll tell you how many days away you are from reaching your next level.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
I had no idea.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
Well that makes it easier to know when to pop the stupid lucky egg.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
So let me go.

35:41.000 --> 35:46.000
So when I go to my friends list and I'm scrolling right now to find dark soccer.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
So she's down here.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
There she is.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
So I.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Oh OK.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
So you tap on the.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
Oh play together for two more days to become ultra friends.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
So we won't hit it today.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
We'll hit it tomorrow.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Yeah.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
Assuming I remember to open her gift after the show that I will.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
So that's how you know.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
OK.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
Good to know.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
Good to know.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
So where am I.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
So there's one person above dark soccer that I'm almost.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
This is one of these guys that I played those online survivor games with.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
So he is at one more day.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
So I will hit three stars with somebody today.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
So there is that.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
That's cool.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
How long do Loki and I have to go before we hit four stars.

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
It looks well I have magma lemur who is kind of the furthest along.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
He has 53 more days.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
So I have to accept your gift.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
So you and I have 56 more days to be BFF.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Yes.

36:37.000 --> 36:42.000
My strongest whatever you want to call it friend in the game is one of my friends in Toronto.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Forty six more days.

36:44.000 --> 36:49.000
So but we have Kyle and I have traded every single day.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Like we have not missed a beat every single day.

36:51.000 --> 36:58.000
He's the first person I send a gift to every day just because he was the most regular at everybody.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
So we ended up being like the closest friends.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
So that's Pokemon Go.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Kuma JP.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
So we're talking about there.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
All right.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
But but some of you some of the listeners are close.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Act Deft is number two on my list.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
And I think as 200 miles like number four behind one of my local friends.

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
So as 200 Matt and Act after still above Shane on my list.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Shane's at number like six or seven on my list.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
So anyway Pokemon Go.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Good times.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
Let's get into some other stuff.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
I want to get into some like housekeeping and announcements sort of thing.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
I do have like a personal announcement.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
So I changed my Twitter name after God I've been on Twitter.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
When did Twitter start like 2006.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
I've probably been on Twitter since 2006.

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
And some of you told me not to give up my four letter name.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
But I did it.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
I switched my name on Twitter to Mr. Rob Roberts.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
So if you want to follow me on Twitter I'm at Mr. Rob Roberts.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
I just didn't feel as strong of a connection to the old name anymore.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
Which I haven't really used regularly since the DDR days.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
When I would enter in my high score with a four letter name.

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
I think due to this show and other podcasts and things I've done.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Was that either friend you again or did you change?

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
No because the good news about Twitter is that it just carries it all with you.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
So I didn't lose anybody.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
No I wouldn't.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Oh my God.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
With being on the site that long I would not want to build up from scratch again.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
No way.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
So I did it because everything carries with you.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
But here's the interesting thing.

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
I tried to snag the old name right back.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
And I had two browsers waiting to go.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
So I made the change on the first browser.

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
And then in the second browser I had a new account ready to go to switch to Sky, my old name.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
I couldn't do it.

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
Because it says you cannot have a Twitter name with less than five characters.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
So Twitter no longer lets you have short usernames.

38:40.000 --> 38:44.000
So at least the good news is nobody can have my old name.

38:44.000 --> 38:52.000
But the kind of crappy part is that I can't put a placeholder for all those old streams and old episodes of the show where I shouted out my old name.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
It's not going to work.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
So that part kind of sucks.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
But I'm trying to look forward not backward.

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
So at least my Instagram and my Twitter are unified now.

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
And so like Snapchat and all that other crap I'll probably try to unify.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
So I have all that one name.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
So that'll be that'll be nice.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
So there it is.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
So that's my new Twitter name.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
Also I want to quickly talk about Dragon Con.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
So we're not going to be here at the end of the month over Labor Day weekend because I'm going to be at Dragon Con.

39:17.000 --> 39:24.000
And I guess I can talk about this now because a lot of the panel schedules or at least, you know, everything is tentative until the show shows up.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
But all the tentative stuff is now out there.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
I'm going to be doing eight panels this year at Dragon Con.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
And I am really excited about it.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
That's a lot of panels.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
But I love doing panels.

39:37.000 --> 39:46.000
And part of the reason why I'm doing more panels at Dragon Con this year than years past is that not only is the Dragon Con podcasting track having me back, which I'm very thankful for.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
And I'm doing some pretty cool stuff with them.

39:48.000 --> 39:52.000
But also I will be working for the first time with the Dragon Con video gaming track.

39:52.000 --> 39:58.000
So if you've never been a video, excuse me, if you've never been to Dragon Con, it's like 20 conventions all happening at once.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
They have all these different tracks that have full time programming.

40:01.000 --> 40:11.000
And there's tracks for Star Trek, Star Wars, Whedonverse, British television because British, or Powell from British Invaders, Brian is almost always doing stuff with that track.

40:11.000 --> 40:19.000
Gary from Critical Myth will probably be doing stuff with either the Trek track or the X track, which is some of like the sci-fi modern programming stuff.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
Like I went to a Twin Peaks panel on the X track last year.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
So, I mean, there's all sorts of like stuff that all happens at once.

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
So I'm working with two tracks this year, whereas every other year I've been to Dragon Con, I've been working with one.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
So I'm very happy.

40:32.000 --> 40:39.000
Bobby, I really would not have been able to do it without Bobby finally getting in touch with the gaming track and kind of pushing us to get on there.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
So I'm really excited about it.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
So let me tell you some of the panels I'm going to be doing.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
I'm going to run through this fast because there's a lot.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
So Friday at 10 a.m., I'm going to be doing a Mass Effect voice actors panel.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Oh my gosh, I'm so thrilled about this one.

40:52.000 --> 40:58.000
Like obviously, you know, I'm a professional, but at the same time, I'm going to fanboy a little bit about Mass Effect.

40:58.000 --> 41:06.000
So this Mass Effect voice actors panel, Mark Muir, who's the male voice of Shepard, the voice of Jack, the voice of Legion, all going to be on this panel.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
I'm really excited about that one.

41:08.000 --> 41:14.000
7 p.m. Eastern on Friday, over with the podcasting track, going to be doing a panel on live broadcasting.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
I only have my short notes for my personal calendar here that I'm looking at.

41:17.000 --> 41:25.000
I'll give you the longer descriptions once the app is out because I would encourage you to download the Dragon Con app if you're going to Dragon Con because it's amazing.

41:25.000 --> 41:31.000
But there's a live broadcasting panel that I'm going to be part of, which, you know, I've been doing live broadcasting thanks to OLR for a little while.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
So we'll have a lot to say there.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
Also doing a podcast panel at 10 o'clock on Friday night.

41:36.000 --> 41:41.000
It is a like Shark Tank style panel for podcasters.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
It's like a pitch your podcast type of thing and we'll give you immediate feedback.

41:44.000 --> 41:52.000
So I get to be the, what's his name, the guy that owns the basketball team, Mark Cuban.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
I get to be the Mark Cuban of that panel.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
Actually, I don't know if I'll be the mean one. I don't know. We'll see.

41:57.000 --> 42:02.000
I'm really, but when it comes to podcasting, I'm very hippy dippy and like everybody should do it.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
Everybody should be a podcaster. So maybe I won't be the Mark Cuban.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
Saturday is going to be very busy for me, but I'm very excited.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
1 o'clock Eastern over the Westin.

42:10.000 --> 42:18.000
I'm going to be doing a Five Nights at Freddy's sister location live playthrough with voice actors from the game.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Sorry, I'm not the one playing the game.

42:20.000 --> 42:26.000
Because that would have been a recipe for disaster, but that's going to be really fun.

42:26.000 --> 42:36.000
Right after that is done, I have to run back over to the hotel where the podcast panel is doing a broadcasting and podcasting type of thing,

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
which I believe, again, I only have my short notes here.

42:39.000 --> 42:45.000
I believe that is a panel about some like the streaming and doing like, you know, again, kind of like live performance stuff.

42:45.000 --> 42:50.000
4 o'clock Eastern back at the Westin. So I'm literally running back and forth that day.

42:50.000 --> 42:55.000
There's a Twitch 101 panel. So they're going to have an engineer from Twitch that's actually going to be there.

42:55.000 --> 43:00.000
And I will be moderating kind of like a, how do you do Twitch? Why should you do Twitch?

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
You know, kind of all about Twitch, like a Twitch discussion.

43:02.000 --> 43:07.000
That'll probably be also a great networking panel because I imagine a lot of Twitch streamers,

43:07.000 --> 43:11.000
probably small up and comers that go to Dragon Con will probably be there wanting to network.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
So I'll be right there networking with you all.

43:14.000 --> 43:20.000
And then back on the podcasting track at 7 o'clock Saturday night, a panel on social media.

43:20.000 --> 43:25.000
So getting on Twitter, Instagram, all the new stuff. There's stuff I haven't even heard of.

43:25.000 --> 43:30.000
I learned about an app called Anchor, which is really big for podcasters, thanks to a panel like this last year.

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
So that will be a lot of fun. So that is on Saturday.

43:34.000 --> 43:41.000
And then I'm not done yet. Sunday at 4 o'clock Eastern, I'm going to be doing an Overwatch voice actors panel.

43:41.000 --> 43:49.000
I am really excited about this and so thankful to the gaming track staff for letting me, trusting me with this.

43:49.000 --> 43:54.000
So the voice actresses behind Mercy, D.Va, and Symmetra will be there.

43:54.000 --> 44:00.000
And it's going to take everything in my power to not ask the question, how does it feel to be gay icons, all of you?

44:00.000 --> 44:07.000
Because honestly, I know a lot of gay Overwatch players and they all play D.Va, Mercy, and Symmetra.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
So that's going to be fun. I'm really excited about that panel.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
So I think that's it. Did I hit all eight? I think I did.

44:13.000 --> 44:20.000
If I didn't, then I haven't put it in my calendar yet, which is probably not a good sign, but I will pick that up.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
I feel like I'm missing one from the podcast track.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
No, I have them all. That was eight.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
It's busy. It's going to be busy, but I'm really excited.

44:30.000 --> 44:35.000
So if you're going to be at Dragon Con, find me in the app once they get it listed.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
I will be under Attending Professionals so you can find me, Rob Roberts, and you'll be able to see my whole schedule right there in the app.

44:39.000 --> 44:44.000
And please come by. Please don't be shy. Come up and say hello at any of the panels.

44:44.000 --> 44:49.000
If your goal is to just say hi to me, I would say go to the ones on the podcasting track.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
Just for the fact of the matter is, the room is smaller for podcasting.

44:53.000 --> 44:58.000
You can imagine these voice actor panels are going to be pretty big, so they'll be using bigger rooms.

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
It'll be easier to kind of talk to me after one of these other panels.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
But I am really, really, really excited about this.

45:04.000 --> 45:10.000
And in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, sj100matt says, contact Rob through his agent Mr. Smoosh.

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
Yes, if you would like to.

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
Mxc says, I wish I were going to Dragon Con. I would love to check out these panels.

45:17.000 --> 45:22.000
Hopefully the podcasting track will do a streaming thing. I know they've done that in years past.

45:22.000 --> 45:27.000
They live streamed some of it, but I know that was also hit and miss in regards to the quality and stuff.

45:27.000 --> 45:32.000
So I don't know if they're still doing it, but cross your fingers on your toes, okay?

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
Some of them get posted to YouTube too, so we'll see.

45:36.000 --> 45:41.000
Anyhow, that's my Dragon Con schedule, so I hope to see many of you Labor Day weekend in Atlanta.

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
So enough about me, let's get to some more gaming news.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
Loki, what's going on in the world of video gaming this week?

45:48.000 --> 45:55.000
The world of video gaming is full of Bitcoin mining and all sorts of garbage.

45:55.000 --> 46:00.000
So yes, apparently someone snuck a game onto Steam.

46:00.000 --> 46:08.000
I should say snuck because, well it was accepted on Steam, but they snuck a crypto-jacking program in there as well.

46:08.000 --> 46:20.000
So the game was called Abstractism, and basically what was happening is that they were noticing that the game is very minimal looking,

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
but for some reason their CPUs and GPUs were taxing from the game.

46:24.000 --> 46:30.000
And so people started wondering, well is this a virus? I mean, what's going on?

46:30.000 --> 46:38.000
And so apparently, after looking through the game, they found out that, oh hey, it's a cryptocurrency miner.

46:38.000 --> 46:44.000
So it did end up getting pulled off of Steam, thanks to Valve.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
Yeah, thanks.

46:45.000 --> 46:54.000
Once it was pointed out, but the developer of course says, you know, abstractism doesn't mine any cryptocurrency.

46:54.000 --> 47:02.000
Probably you are playing on high graphics settings because they take a bit of CPU and GPU power for the post-processing effects rendering.

47:02.000 --> 47:14.000
Yeah, except the game apparently found that, you know, running on a virtual machine, that the resource usage is unrelated to graphical rendering,

47:14.000 --> 47:20.000
as it persisted even when the game is not being rendered, or being rendered by a separate GPU.

47:20.000 --> 47:25.000
So it was a big ol' scam, and it got removed.

47:25.000 --> 47:32.000
Basically they said they removed abstractism and banned its developer from Steam for shipping with unauthorized code, trolling, scamming.

47:32.000 --> 47:37.000
Yeah, how much money did he make first though? Like, how much Bitcoin was he able to mine because of this?

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Probably not much, if anything.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
Haven't they mined all the Bitcoin by now? Isn't that well dry?

47:42.000 --> 47:49.000
It's harder to do it now, and I just don't think that they would have. I mean, this thing looks like it's drawn, like, with a pencil.

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
I mean, it's very minimalistic, so I can't imagine-

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Well, because it's trying to use your processor to mine Bitcoin.

47:54.000 --> 48:01.000
Yeah, I can't imagine that there'd be any pro- like, it just doesn't seem very processor-intensive, so I- it's definitely bullshit, but whatever.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
So at least that's done. Um, and then, you know, there's-

48:04.000 --> 48:08.000
More garbage on the Steam store, because they barely moderate it. What a shock!

48:08.000 --> 48:19.000
Yes! Well, speaking of more garbage on the Steam store, so, there's an issue with, um, fake items, dummy items, masquerading as Team Fortress 2 or Dota 2 rarities.

48:19.000 --> 48:34.000
And, so what they're doing is, apparently people are sneaking games onto Steam again, as called something else, but they use, like, an icon or items that look exactly like the items that are in, um, Team Fortress 2 or Dota 2.

48:34.000 --> 48:47.000
So when you're looking at them on, you know, the boards to swap stuff, when you're going through that and trying to buy, um, these rare items, you may notice that they look the same, and so you might purchase it by mistake.

48:48.000 --> 48:56.000
So, um, apparently, they're saying that, you know, we started, um, requiring approval for app name changes.

48:56.000 --> 49:06.000
So yeah, what would happen is they'd put it up like, you know, my game is dumb shit, you know, platformer 2, and then, once you get in there, I'm gonna change my name to Team Fortress 2 now.

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
Just after it's already on there, and then, you know, fuck with shit.

49:10.000 --> 49:19.000
Um, so basically, we started requiring approval for app name changes and have more planned to address this sort of problem that we couldn't get done in one day.

49:19.000 --> 49:31.000
We're hoping to have to dismiss two warning dialogues and be sufficient to make people think twice about trades containing forged items, but this is not the end of our response. We'll continue the monitor, of course.

49:31.000 --> 49:36.000
I just gotta think, you know, with this whole, like, crap that goes on.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
The Steam store is messy. It is messy.

49:39.000 --> 49:48.000
Remember how crappy, or like, I didn't think it was that crappy to begin with, Steam Greenlight? I'm kinda wishing we had Steam Greenlight again, because this is bullshit.

49:48.000 --> 49:53.000
I do too. I just think a lot of changes the store's made in the past few years, it's just, it's a mess. It's a mess.

49:53.000 --> 50:01.000
It's fine if you wanna go grab, like, if you know that, like, Civ 6 is out, and you know exactly where you're going to get it and all that stuff, but as far as, like, discovery and all that, it's a mess.

50:01.000 --> 50:08.000
And, you know, the whole process before, like, I think the getting rid of the Steam Greenlight was, well, we just don't really wanna vet this stuff anymore, and it's like,

50:08.000 --> 50:19.000
well, we can make a lot more money if everybody is, you know, able to pay us $100 to put any game up, but it, they thought $100 would be a barrier to entry for anybody to put stuff up on the store, but it's not.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
No, it's not.

50:20.000 --> 50:29.000
It's no barrier whatsoever, and I think as terrible as Greenlight was, I kinda wish it was back, because this is, it's even worse now.

50:29.000 --> 50:36.000
Yeah, I agree. And, you know, ST-100 Matt brings up, at least when YYR made a game about shit, he stuck to it and didn't change it.

50:36.000 --> 50:47.000
Well, you know, speaking of a different game that YYR made, you know, it's, in my opinion, it is still a crime that Super Multitasking is not, like, an all-star game that everybody is talking about.

50:47.000 --> 50:52.000
Like, and it's because Steam is such a mess, that game probably never gets featured, unfortunately.

50:52.000 --> 51:06.000
It's, it's probably really hard to stick out amongst, you know, it's just, it's just hard to hear about these, like, apps, or these games that are secretly Bitcoin miners and shit, when it's like, you know, there's gems out there, like Super Multitasking.

51:06.000 --> 51:13.000
Or games that are put up on there, where they're, like, you can't pass the first level, where it's just, like, absolute basic stuff is broken.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
Yeah.

51:14.000 --> 51:20.000
Or they seem executable, or they, yeah, executable for the game is not included with it, or something ridiculous.

51:20.000 --> 51:26.000
Rage Nator does point out Greenlight was abused a good percentage of the time, essentially, will give you this $10 game for free if you upvoted on Greenlight.

51:26.000 --> 51:32.000
I understand that it was, you know, it was abused, but this is far worse now.

51:32.000 --> 51:41.000
Now, you know, where they don't have to go through that whole step of, like, trying to get people to upvote it, now it's just, I'm just gonna literally shit into the marketplace.

51:41.000 --> 51:48.000
You know, sometimes it could be one game that they've cloned, like, five or six times under different names, and they'll just throw that shit up on there.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
I don't know.

51:51.000 --> 51:59.000
All right. Well, anyhow, let's move on and talk about, you know, when Steam becomes such a mess, you might turn to other ways to get your games, like piracy.

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
Just get, don't pirate games, you shouldn't do that, because A.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
All the time.

52:03.000 --> 52:08.000
You need to support developers, and B, you can get banned from your Nintendo system from doing it.

52:08.000 --> 52:17.000
We talked already about the Switch, and how the Switch had made this change, where it's getting a little better at detecting pirated software, and basically banning your Nintendo account.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
Well, guess what happened this week?

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
The 3DS also got a firmware update.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
That's right.

52:22.000 --> 52:29.000
The firmware update that came out this week on the 3DS, which a lot of people are paying attention to this week, because that new WarioWare game, which I still need to grab.

52:29.000 --> 52:34.000
The WarioWare Gold, because I guess it does have new stuff, as well as, like, old stuff, so I'm in if there's new stuff.

52:34.000 --> 52:39.000
So the new WarioWare game came out on 3DS, so everybody's checking it out, but they have to update their firmware to do it.

52:40.000 --> 52:53.000
3DS firmware update implements this same feature that will detect a pirated game, and if it senses you running it, you will have your Nintendo account and your system banned, because you're a dirty, filthy pirate.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
So, at least in Nintendo's eyes.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
Not my words, theirs, no.

52:56.000 --> 53:01.000
Anyway, all seriousness, that is something that Nintendo is really trying to push against.

53:02.000 --> 53:08.000
Very interesting to see Nintendo ramp up a lot of these efforts recently between not just the Switch firmware, but 3DS firmware.

53:08.000 --> 53:14.000
We had that story about the ROM sites last week, so it'll be interesting to see what continues, but I know, I know.

53:14.000 --> 53:21.000
What y'all really want to see is, okay, if they're shutting down all this stuff about the classic games, where's their solution for the Switch already?

53:21.000 --> 53:26.000
Which, hopefully, we will finally know about in the coming months, but who knows?

53:26.000 --> 53:30.000
I feel like I've been saying that like a broken record for a couple years, so we will see.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
Meanwhile, other big, big things in gaming, Dark Sakura.

53:43.000 --> 53:49.000
Well, parents want their children to be successful, don't you think? Good parents do.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
I would hope so, yeah.

53:51.000 --> 53:59.000
So there are parents who are hiring video game tutors to teach their kids how to be good at Fortnite and other games.

54:01.000 --> 54:11.000
It was reported by the Wall Street Journal that there are families who have hired tutors to help them get better at video games, charging over $50 an hour for the service,

54:11.000 --> 54:23.000
so that they will be able to attend schools, scholarships, or get scholarships at schools that offer incentive to gamers that join tournament teams.

54:24.000 --> 54:30.000
And so these parents are investing in their video game skills.

54:30.000 --> 54:38.000
I don't see a problem with this, but this is basically if you were to kind of draw parallels with any sports type stuff, like football.

54:38.000 --> 54:44.000
It's like people trying to go professional with football and stuff, and training people that way.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
I used to have a private tutor for saxophone.

54:47.000 --> 54:58.000
Yeah, so I mean, whatever they want to use their money on, as long as they're teaching their kids as well, that listen, you have to have a strong education foundation,

54:58.000 --> 55:07.000
but this might help you get in the door as well, but if this doesn't work out, have this to rely on as well.

55:07.000 --> 55:16.000
I mean, there's no problem with, if you can get in a football scholarship and go to a really nice school, more power to you, but you gotta have the grades to back that up, too.

55:17.000 --> 55:22.000
Yeah, I mean, honestly, I don't hate this news, and I'm not gonna make fun of it.

55:22.000 --> 55:26.000
If this is something a parent wants to spend money on for their kid, go for it.

55:26.000 --> 55:33.000
And that answer might surprise you guys, because I see a lot of talk on social media kind of poo-pooing this news about,

55:33.000 --> 55:38.000
LOL, what kind of parent would hire a tutor for a video game for their kid and all that stuff,

55:38.000 --> 55:45.000
but you gave the exact same example I was gonna give, is that people do it for football, baseball.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
People do it for competitive sports all the time.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
Pageantry.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
Why not?

55:49.000 --> 55:57.000
Singing. How many people hire singing coaches, because their son or daughter is gonna be the next American Idol or something?

55:57.000 --> 56:02.000
Yes and no. I'm gonna separate the arts a little bit differently from competitive sports.

56:02.000 --> 56:06.000
I don't wanna draw direct parallels, like even though Dark Soccer has had a saxophone tutor and stuff,

56:06.000 --> 56:12.000
maybe this is just because I grew up band nerd, but I do still feel there is a difference with tutoring in the arts,

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
and that is a very different bubble from this.

56:15.000 --> 56:20.000
But this is not the first time I've heard of tutors being hired for competitive sports, and that's what Fortnite is.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
It's a competitive sport.

56:21.000 --> 56:26.000
You can't make fun of this, in my opinion, you can't make fun of this, and then in the same breath go,

56:26.000 --> 56:31.000
but I don't understand why ESPN won't show e-gaming sports.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
The future is here, people.

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
ESPN is showing that type of stuff now.

56:36.000 --> 56:43.000
The Overwatch League is pushing this ceiling that video games have had when it comes to competitive sports higher and higher,

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
and not just Overwatch League, I mean that's the first thing that comes to mind,

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
but look at EVO getting more and more mainstream stuff, and other gaming things as well.

56:50.000 --> 56:59.000
As our generation, the Generation X and the Millennials and the Zillennials, you know what I mean though?

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
The Zennials.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
Zennials, excuse me.

57:01.000 --> 57:06.000
But you know what I mean, the generations that are our age, as we all grew up with video games,

57:06.000 --> 57:10.000
and as we are getting older and we are making the purchasing decisions for the households and so forth,

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
this is that natural step, is that that type of stuff is now, like,

57:14.000 --> 57:20.000
Overwatch is as much a competitive sport to enjoy watching as bowling, or the other stuff they show.

57:20.000 --> 57:24.000
Maybe you should compare it with bowling, because bowling is kind of boring.

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
But, Loki, in all seriousness, it depends on who you are.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
Like, you know, I've known people that were like competitive bowlers.

57:30.000 --> 57:34.000
He kind of turned out to be a jerk though, but I mean, I have known people that do that stuff,

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
and if that's what you're into, then cool, you know what I mean?

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Fine, as long as you're not hurting anybody, right?

57:39.000 --> 57:45.000
So, but anyway, I just, yeah, I don't hate this story.

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
As long as, and you know, I think Dark Sakura kind of references too,

57:48.000 --> 57:53.000
as long as the kid is going outside, getting fresh air, getting vitamin D,

57:53.000 --> 57:56.000
interacting with other kids, doing the other things,

57:56.000 --> 58:00.000
then honestly, I see no difference between this and football coaching.

58:00.000 --> 58:04.000
Except the fact that, yes, football coaching is more physical in nature,

58:04.000 --> 58:09.000
but Fortnite is mental, I suppose, mental activity.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
Chess coaching.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
And I'm not, sure, chess coaching.

58:12.000 --> 58:15.000
And I'm not saying, hold that kid up inside all day.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Let the kid go outside and play in the mud.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
That's what kids do, you know, let the kid go outside and play in traffic.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
No, just kidding, don't do that, but you know what I mean.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Let them go outside and be kids too.

58:24.000 --> 58:30.000
I'm sure there are going to be stage parent horror stories in Fortnite,

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
but again, all these other things we named have them too.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Well, the other thing that's kind of unique about Fortnite

58:34.000 --> 58:37.000
and like other games of the like are,

58:37.000 --> 58:40.000
they're probably not going to be around forever either.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
I mean, just because Fortnite's popular right now,

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
next year could be a whole other game.

58:44.000 --> 58:47.000
So don't get necessarily focused on one game,

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
just become better at gaming altogether.

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
Okay, go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
Dungeon Buster says,

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
I remember when people were looking for tutors when Age of Empire was huge.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
So it's always something.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Let's see, S2100Matt says,

59:01.000 --> 59:05.000
I hope those tutors are teaching kids to be good people online as well.

59:05.000 --> 59:09.000
I also hope the tutor teaches the kids how to properly balance gaming,

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
school, work, and other real life things as well.

59:12.000 --> 59:16.000
Well, I would hope good sportsmanship is a part of that tutor

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
because this may shock you guys.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
You may not know this about me,

59:20.000 --> 59:24.000
but when I was a kid, I played soccer for many years.

59:24.000 --> 59:27.000
Apparently, I was pretty good at being a goalie.

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
So I did soccer from the time I was like five

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
until probably I left it behind to join band when I was 12.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
So I played soccer for a very long time.

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
And a good coach is going,

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
as I had many coaches during those years when I played soccer,

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
a good coach is going to teach you about good sportsmanship

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
and that, you know, when you lose a game,

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
you don't fucking like yell at the other team and stuff.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
You still shake their hand and say, good game.

59:50.000 --> 59:55.000
So again, a similar parallel to what already exists in our society

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
when it comes to other sports and things like that.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, some other comments.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Let's see, Bobby Blackwell says,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
I watched a competitive cornhole tournament a few weeks ago.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
You know, the game you play at tailgates

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
where you throw the bag into the hole.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000
It was on ESPN, not 2 or the Ocho.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
No, that is a legit thing. I was at a bar last week.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000
I was actually convinced to go to a straight bar,

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
which doesn't always happen, but I went

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
and they were playing that cornhole game.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
And that wasn't the first time I'd heard about it either

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
because I actually was looking into this whole thing

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
where like locally they have these different sports leagues.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
I felt like I found it on Reddit.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Somebody was asking about things to do in town on Reddit

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
and somebody suggested like, well, if you want to meet people,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
this sports league is really popular.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
And I don't remember the name of it,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
but it basically like they have the stuff you would expect

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
to see like a neighborhood softball.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I don't think you do baseball with softball team

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
or maybe it's T-ball, one of those things

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
or a neighborhood bowling is always a big thing with that.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
But they actually had like, you know, a cornhole thing.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And I was like, what the fuck is cornhole?

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
And I actually did.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
And then it was like not even like a few days

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
after reading that on Reddit.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Then I actually saw people playing it at this bar

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
and I was like, oh, they're playing that game

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I was reading about, which is you throw a bag into a hole

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
and it's not like the sport exists basically.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
So that sport exists for people that maybe

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
they just want to be there for the social aspect

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
and, you know, play a game that's less strenuous,

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
I suppose, than maybe something like ice hockey.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
You know what I mean?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000
So, yeah. Yeah. Why not?

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I mean, golf, it's kind of a lot of you do walk.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
You do walk a lot in golf.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
You have to, you know, you don't.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
True, true. All right.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Bobby Bockel says it's huge at tailgating.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Yes, it's a branded beanbag toss.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
It sure is.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
I'm pretty sure this thing I was looking at at the bar

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
was one of the beer companies was sponsoring it.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
So that's that's the thing.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
So anyhow, there you go.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Wow. All these different talks on sports,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
all because of tutors in Fortnite.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
But Fortnite is just that big of a deal right now.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
It's the game of the moment, you know?

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Yes.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
All right.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I the one I guess the one element and then I promise to move on.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
The one element, though, is that you also don't like half,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
even though I'm not like laughing at this news and saying this is stupid.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Like at the same time, you don't have to hire a tutor.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Just play Fortnite a lot.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000
And and if you're a parent, get involved with your kid playing Fortnite.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Watch them, cheer them on, support them,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
help them notice some of the things on the screen.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Maybe they're missing.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Well, I think that these parents are doing that because that's why

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
they're doing the tutoring is because they are playing with them

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
and they want them to be better.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
I don't know. I just hope it's not like they want them to get good.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Yet you brought up the pageant thing.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
And you know, a lot of kids get involved in those pageants

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
because it's, you know, mom living out her fantasy.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
I don't think so.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
They're like, I mean, I am sure that there's some instances where,

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
like, you know, somebody might be convincing someone to play something.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000
But I think it's just more like encouraging them with what they want.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
They see, you know, it's just like myself, like he wants to be a YouTuber

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
because he watches YouTubers.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
It's like if someone's watching Twitch streamers of Fortnite players,

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
they're going to want to be a Fortnite player

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
because that's what they watch is what they want to do.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
So you just have to support them.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000
And then eventually they'll either stick with it or they'll grow out of it.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I wanted to be in construction and engineering.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
My wife would have preferred if I went into engineering.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I did not go into engineering because I'm, you know.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
This is a struggle that lasts until college, okay?

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000
I went to college and originally I was doing computer science and I hated it.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000
And then I got into, I was going to be a weatherman on TV.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000
And I interned at a CBS station in the town where I went to school

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
and all this stuff.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And as much as, like, I learned a lot from the experience,

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I also learned from that experience.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
This is absolutely not what I want to do.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Like, now that I've seen the reality of what goes into, I do not want to do this.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
You don't want to go stand in the hurricane?

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
It's just, it's a lot more depressing.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
My friend's dad is actually a hurricane chaser.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Yeah.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
And that's, you know, I'm not going to bash the people that do it.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
It's actually quite the opposite.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Like, I realized I don't have the strength and the self-esteem

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
to handle something like that.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
You know what my original major was before I changed it to Japanese?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Forensic geology.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Oh, wow. That's kind of cool.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
And I decided rocks are boring.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.000
But at the same time, like, A, the day job that I do have as a corporate trainer,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
like, I love it. It's awesome.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
And I feel like, you know, cool.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
I found this not through school, but through working my way up into it.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
And that's awesome.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000
And B, you know, it's not that the broadcasting stuff I learned in college

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000
went completely to waste because, look, here we are.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Like, you know, and I can say, I'm using my quoting fingers.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I built this, obviously, with Jamie and Loki,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
but I can still look at it and go, as opposed to, like, you know,

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
something where it had to be done on somebody else's terms,

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
reporting to somebody else and ratings and all this other stuff,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
I can look at this and go, but no, we have this,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.000
and this is something that I helped build, and we do it by our rules.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
You know what I mean?

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
But I do wish we had the ratings.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Well, you know what, there came a point a long time ago

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
where I just kind of realized if that was going to happen,

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
it would have happened, and it hasn't, but that's okay.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
You know what, though, Loki?

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
But, like, there's that, but at the same time, like, you know,

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
it's taken a long time, but, like, the fact that I'm doing these panels

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
at Dragon Con is pretty amazing.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Not everybody gets to do that.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000
So, like, I'm thankful for that. I'm super thankful.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Okay, so I'm not PewDiePie, but who would want to be him?

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
He's an asshole.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
But you know what I mean?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Like, with the spotlight can also come a lot of that negativity

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
of where everything you do is scrutinized type of thing.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
You know, maybe not the best name for me to throw out there

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
because he deserved to be scrutinized for some of those things that he did,

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
but you know what I mean?

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Like, I also really like my privacy.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Like, you know, sure, Sunday night we do this show.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
We have our small little audience.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
I love you guys.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
We're a great little family here on Sunday nights and so forth

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
and throughout the week with the podcast feed.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I don't want to leave you guys out either.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.000
That's all fantastic, but y'all are nice and respectful of my privacy.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I like that. You know what I mean?

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Knock on wood, I'm not getting death threats.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000
And unfortunately, that's some of the stuff that comes with getting bigger.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.000
When we were at our peak, when iTunes first launched podcasting

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
and we were one of only a handful of video game podcasts

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
the day that iTunes launched podcasting in the store,

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
we did have to taste a little bit of that unfortunate side.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Like, people at dark soccer, you got it worse than anyone

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
because unfortunately, you're a girl gamer.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
And fuck all those idiots. I don't give a shit what they think.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Well, guess what? You're still here.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Where are they?

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
They're not.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
They're not?

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
They have their kids and they've been punished.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Guess who doesn't have kids?

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Anyway, let's see.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Bobby Blackwell says, hey, at least you're not interviewing Billy Mitchell.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Bobby Blackwell has seen his variety.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I would totally want to interview him because I don't give a shit about him

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
and that's the best kind of mentality to have.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
That's why you don't get to interview him.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Here's the thing.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Oh, come on.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Here's the thing.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I ask the hard-hitting questions.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Remember, Konami, Jason Enos?

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Here's the thing. Here's the thing.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:44.000
As much as Bobby has kind of taken a few licks over that whole interview

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
and the article and everything,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.000
at the same time, it is a perfect example of all publicity is good publicity

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
because it did get...

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Now Bobby gets to say, as seen on Variety,

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Bobby gets to say he was at that infamous panel with Billy Mitchell.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Bobby got invites to other shows he probably wouldn't have been a part of

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
if he hadn't done that because he got that publicity.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
You know what I mean?

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
So he's growing his own networking from that.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000
So, I mean, yes, was it probably difficult for him in some ways?

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I'm sure it was to read some of that negativity and stuff,

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000
but at the same time, I still think he's emerged from that whole experience

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000
bigger as a name than he was before.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
So, anyway.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Let's see.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Other comments in chat at live.vognetwork.com.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Oh, well, this is depressing.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I hate to interrupt.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
There's horrible dead celebrity news.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Are you ready for this, DarkSakura?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I dropped my phone.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
The guy that played Cornelius Fudge died?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
No, this is worse.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
That he did, though.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
This is worse.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Charlotte Rae, also Mrs. Garrett on The Facts of Life and Different Strokes,

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
passed away, but 92.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Well, he was also 92.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Yeah.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
So, I mean, bless her heart.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
So that's unfortunate.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000
And y'all know I grew up on The Facts of Life.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Well...

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
I saw a lot of myself in Joe.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
I don't know what it was, but...

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Betty White sacrifices yet another to take her place.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
So...

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Alright, anyhow.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Well, rest in peace, Charlotte Rae, who, of course, I loved,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
loved The Facts of Life growing up, so that's depressing.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Anyway, let's move on.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
We do have some more video game news.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
More Fortnite stuff, right, Logie?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Ah, yes.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:37.000
So, Fortnite will not be coming to your neighborly Google Play Store

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:43.000
because they take 30% of the in-app purchases for games sold through their storefront.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
And, as Epic would put it,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000
the 30% tax is a high cost in a world where game developers,

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:58.000
70% must cover all of the costs of game developing, operating, and supporting their games.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
And this is from Tim Sweeney.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
And basically saying that what they're going to do instead is

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
they're going to maintain a direct relationship with their consumers.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.000
They're going to have a stand-alone installer for the Android version of the game.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Which, you know, being that they are on that platform,

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
and, you know, to the benefit, I guess, of Android users,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000
that it's an open marketplace, so you don't have to use the Google Play Store if you don't want to,

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000
unlike Apple and their closed marketplace where they have to go through that.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
They can, I guess, do that.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
So...

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Well, I guess it's a good way to get around the 30%.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Yeah, right.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I mean, it's kind of diabolical in some ways.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.000
It's not like, you know, yeah, I mean, because they're a big enough game where it's like,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
we can do whatever the fuck we want. We don't need your fucking advertising.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000
We're Fortnite, bitch.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
We're Fortnite, bitch, yeah. Exactly.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000
All right.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Going to chat at live.vognetwork.com.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Bobby Blackwell says,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.000
The worry here is that everyone has to turn on developer tools to sideload the app,

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000
and that leaves a lot of unprotected phones for malware.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
People like Loki and I already have that turned on,

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000
but you are potentially exposing your phone to other threats by doing that,

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000
especially when we're talking about that there are kids that play Fortnite,

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
as we just heard in the last story.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Yeah.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000
So, that is an unfortunate side effect to all that,

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.000
so hopefully Epic will kind of have some responsibility in kind of educating people,

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
since they are going around the store and they are such a big game,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.000
on how to prevent from getting malware and that stuff on your phone.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Or maybe, can you open it and then close it?

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Can you open it, grab the game, then close it?

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Does that work?

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Right, but then anytime you push something to it though,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
like updates and stuff, they may need to do it again.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I don't know.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
It's hard to say how they're going to have it set up.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
They could have it where they just install it

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000
and it installs other supplemental files without permissions.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
I don't know.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
I don't know.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
All right.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Well, let's shift gears here a little bit and talk about some Bioware news.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000
And you all know that I've been a little salty when it comes to things Bioware,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
because of what happened with Mass Effect.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
You have me both.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Yeah, I know Jamie's right there with me.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000
But some interesting comments in a new blog from Casey Hudson,

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
who's the boss of Bioware now,

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
who of course was the big name behind the Mass Effect trilogy.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Interesting in the Midsummer update, he went on to say,

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.000
We hear loud and clear the interest in Bioware doing more Dragon Age and Mass Effect.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000
So rest assured that we have some teams hidden away

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
working on some secret stuff that I think you'll really like.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
We're just not ready to talk about it for a little while.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Will we get our Quarian DLC for Andromeda, please?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Sadly, I don't think that's going to happen.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000
What about the remaster?

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Do you think that might come?

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
The other thing I was thinking of is that, you know,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000
that thing that I thought would have happened between Mass Effect 3 and Andromeda,

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
a multiplayer mode spin-off, basically,

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
because the multiplayer mode in Mass Effect is pretty darn good.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000
I think 3 was a little better than Andromeda's,

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
but Andromeda's wasn't bad by any means.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.000
So it would be interesting if maybe they expanded on that with another multiplayer game,

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
which would certainly meet all of the soul-sucking EA needs

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
of microtransactions and loot boxes and all that shit.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Whatever. You could do enough in those games without ever buying a single treasure box.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
You could if you wanted to.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I know sometimes we did with leftover currency and what have you from Origin,

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
but, I mean, at the end of the day, you could do a lot in those games without buying the dumb boxes.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
So, I don't know. What do you think, Jamie?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Do you think they're maybe working on a full new Mass Effect game,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
or do you think maybe it's some silly side story or what?

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I have no idea as long as it's just not fucking Anthem.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
And not a mobile phone game.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
If it's a mobile phone game, fuck right off.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Now, Mass Effect Mobile was very good

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000
when it was like the galaxy map thing that interacted with the game.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
That was cool.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
But if it's like, oh, we've got this brand new Mass Effect game,

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
but it's a mobile phone, fuck off.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Please don't let me near that announcement.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
I don't know if we'll see microtransactions in a new Mass Effect game

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
just because they're making so much off of their sports game titles.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
I don't know if you read this week, there was some guy that was in Europe

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000
that part of their new law or whatever, the privacy laws,

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.000
they can request information from any company that's collecting data on them

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
to see what kind of data they have.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.000
And he looked at his purchases for FIFA, the boxes and stuff.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.000
He spent over 16,000 euro in the last two years on that stuff

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.000
because he has that kind of expendable income.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
I never want to see my receipts from Pokémon GO.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I never want to see how much I've spent on Pokémon GO

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
because I will be so upset and mad.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:54.000
But that's, you know, they're making 16,000 off of one person.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000
I mean, granted, that is an outlier.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
They're making bank.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000
And so they don't need to put the same face in some of the other games,

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
but I don't know. It's still sickening.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
All right. Well, let's move on with some more news

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
about some things we know are happening based on footage, right, Jamie?

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Yes. I'm sure our Persona fans will be super thrilled with this.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.000
The next RPG that's coming out is Persona Q2 New Cinema Labyrinth.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.000
They just had a new trailer come out that released some details.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:29.000
So cast from past three of the mainline games are going to be coming in.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000
It actually has a little chibi version of the Persona 5 Phantom Thieves.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
So it fits the whole style.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000
And then there are going to be new characters thrown into it as well.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:47.000
They also showed that you can have the party made up of three main protagonists.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000
And that you can also see the Persona 3 protagonist casting a spell

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
with Persona 5-style graphics.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
And so it's just interesting stuff.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000
But I'm sure all of our Persona fans are going to be completely thrilled about this.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Of course, as we know, Persona is a spinoff of the Shin Megami Tensei games.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
So enjoy.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
I wish I got more into the Persona games.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Like, they have their fans and they love them.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:20.000
But I'm just, oh my god, it's so many hours of game. You know what I mean?

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.000
I have some of the Saturn ones that I got off Etsy not too long ago.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Haven't played any of them.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Speaking of Shin Megami Tensei, I was told that there is a new mobile phone game,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Shin Megami Tensei Liberation DX2, that's now available.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
And that we should check that out.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Make it so.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Make it so. Maybe I will. I will do that.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Alright. Let's move on.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Talk about a few more stories before we get to the classic peripheral of the month.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Loki.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Hey, there's a new console coming. I bet you didn't expect that.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
This is a console that's not from one of your normal console makers.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:02.000
This is actually a collaboration between AMD and a Chinese company called Zhongshan's Sabur.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.000
And they're creating a custom console hardware for the Chinese market.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Now, spec-wise, it's kind of similar to a Playstation 4 Pro.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
It's going to be using Ryzen as well.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000
It's basically a system on a chip that's Ryzen and the RX Vega.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.000
And it's going to, like I said, spec-wise, it's pretty similar to the Playstation Pro.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000
They've got 8 gigs of GDDR5.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:34.000
They're saying that they're not using DDR4 RAM.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000
But it's basically going to be similar to the setup of the Playstation 4.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:46.000
The system on the chip, they've got 24 compute units, 1.3 gigahertz for 3.99 teraflops of GPU power.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000
And I've got to say, though, they do have a picture of what the console looks like.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
It's sexy-looking.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000
But I'm kind of curious to see, though, what the hell this is going to be used for.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Because such a powerful console, what's going to be on it?

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Well, unfortunately, it's not a Playstation 4.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
But the good news is, it's just going to be copies of PS4 games.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000
I'm kidding.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
They did say, though, they're also going to release the console.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.000
There's going to be a version of the console that's just a computer, like a PC.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000
But they're going to have actual games for it, though.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000
But I'm kind of curious to see what this is.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
I'd be kind of curious to find out what's going to be running on this thing.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Yeah, you always wonder, is there going to be a big game that's on one of these consoles?

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Man, I want to play that. Bring that out over here.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Yeah, so check it out and see what the pricing is and go from there, I guess.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Well, the wait.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
In chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Rama says,

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Hold up, Ryzen? Bro, that's leaps and bounds over Playstation 4 Pro.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Tigerglass says, I've been hearing a lot about those Ryzen CPUs.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000
They are powerful, but not as powerful as Intel, though.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
And here's the thing.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Again, though, the whole golden rule of gaming, though,

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
is the system is only as good as the games that are on it.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.000
But you did open the door there with the hole, but they have this PC type of build.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
That makes it a little bit different, I suppose.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
But otherwise, it could have all the teraflops at once.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
If the games are shitty, it's not going to matter.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
You know what I mean?

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Right, I have no idea.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Because, I mean, China is just getting into the console market.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Because up until quite recently, they were banned from being over there.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:29.000
So it is kind of curious to see that we may have another contender.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000
And that's kind of funny, because even in the mobile space now,

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.000
we've got contenders for mobile phones that are these Chinese companies

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000
that no one's ever heard of.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
And all of a sudden, they're like, oh, hey, these phones fucking kick ass.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000
So it's interesting to see what happens out of this.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
All right, well, we'll see when maybe some games get announced for this.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Who knows?

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
A game that has been announced that I know a lot of us are excited to play

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
is Pokemon Let's Go, the upcoming Switch spinoff game

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000
that kind of combines the traditional Pokemon RPG

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000
with some of the features from the Pokemon Go mobile game.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Apparently, there's going to be a big change when it comes to shinies,

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000
because you will be able to see shinies on the map.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.000
But it's not quite as easy as necessarily like, oh, there is a Pikachu

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
that is a slightly darker brownish type of color.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
That's not quite how it works.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000
What it is is basically a shiny Pokemon doesn't look different

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
than other Pokemon in the overworld when it appears,

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:32.000
but a small glimmer, an aura, gives a player a chance to know

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
that the Pokemon they're looking at is shiny.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:40.000
That is kind of a little hint maybe that this Pidgey is a little bit special.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
It's got something that might be a little different.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Which, again, when it comes to shiny Pokemon, at least in most of the games,

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
especially in Go, it means literally nothing.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
It's a different color. That's it.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
It's a different color that's much more rare than the standard one.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
So does it mean anything in the other games too?

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Well, we don't know about Pokemon Let's Go.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Well, like in the other games.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
No, not the new ones.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.000
I think in the old Gen 2 or Gen 3, and chat, correct me if I'm wrong,

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000
but I want to say there was something about the stats with shinies

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
would be a little bumped, but I don't think they continued that

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
in the more recent games.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
That kind of went away.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
So now it's just, oh, they're just a slightly different color,

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000
and they're really rare, but that doesn't mean people don't obsess

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
about collecting them.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Obviously, we've all joked about our friend Shane,

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.000
who used to do the Pokestop podcast here at VOG Network.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
He loves to collect shinies.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
By the way, he does this in Go.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
He collects shinies in Go. Why?

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Because they're shiny.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
When you trade people's shinies, do they stay shiny?

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000
They stay shiny, but they won't keep the stats.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Just like any other Pokemon when you trade them.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.000
And it can be very expensive to trade a shiny that you don't have

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.000
if you're not at least three-star friends with the other person.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.000
If you're only at one star, it's a million stardust

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
to get a new shiny in your decks.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
So, anyway.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Let's see.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Oh, I guess there's still comments on the system.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.000
They're having arguments about who makes the better chipsets in there.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000
So, Fifth Dream says,

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000
it just tells what stats they have, but they're not even great stats.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
So, SG100Matt says,

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000
yep, gen one through three stats were better in the early games.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Now they're just color variants.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Yeah, that's what I kind of thought was the case there.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Anyway, November 16th, you can start to collect shinies and more

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
in Pokemon Let's Go.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
I know I'm very much looking forward to that game.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Yeah, the game does look awesome.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
I'm actually looking, I'm very excited for it.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
I haven't really played any actual mainline Pokemon games,

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
so it'd be very interesting to check it out.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Yeah.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
And what was it, we have like, I think,

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I don't think we're talking about, but in a couple weeks,

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
I want to say that the rumor is

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
that there's going to be some sort of evolution fest in gen four in Pokemon Go.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Yeah, that rumor's been circulating for a bit.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
I've been sock piling candy,

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
just because I don't want to

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
evolve this crap that I have.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Yeah, like an evolution event that would introduce some of the gen four Pokemon.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
I know that's something, I know there's a lot of rumors about PvP,

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
because I guess something came out of one of the Ingress events

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
that happened last weekend.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000
There was an interview with a Niantic representative at the Poland event.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Warsaw was one of the sites for an anomaly.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
And there was an interview with a Niantic rep there who said,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
basically flat out, that they're trying to get PvP done this year.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
So that's something, that's like the next big thing for Pokemon Go.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.000
But it's with every gen that's hit the game,

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000
something huge hit with it.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Like gen three gave us the weather boosting.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Gen two was, was that the gym redesign?

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Would gen two hit?

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I think so. So maybe gen four is going to be PvP.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I don't know. So we'll see.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I mean, the friends list was already kind of a big

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
frickin' change to the game.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
And the gifting and all that stuff.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
So I don't know. Alright.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Anyhow, let's go to a more classic time in gaming.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
When you couldn't collect any shinies, they didn't exist.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000
It's the classic peripheral of the month, because once a month,

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Dark Sakura mixes it up a bit and not only says,

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
here's a game that you should be checking out,

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000
but hey, here's a little peripheral, something that helps you play games,

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
that you may have never heard of.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
And this one is, yeah, very much...

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
It's not even playing a game, really.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Yeah, this is an interesting one you picked this month,

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
but I like it. What is the classic peripheral of the month?

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000
I picked, as it was known in the US,

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
the Singer Isaac sewing machine.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
For Game Boy.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Yes. For Game Boy.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000
In Japan, it was released as the Jaguar JN 100,

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000
which was about $600 when it was released.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Um...

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000
It, um, I just picked general Game Boy games.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Game Boy music? That's fine.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
So anyway, it was a sewing machine

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000
that would hook up to a Game Boy cartridge

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.000
that was called Rakuraku machine,

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
which is sewing machine, is what it was called.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
We actually got this in the US,

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
because they marketed this in the US

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
as the Singer Isaac for Game Boy.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000
There's sites that are selling them for about $400.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:22.000
You can get a full Jaguar Nintendo sewing machine

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000
for $1400 on eBay, by the way.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000
I just happened to double check a finished auction on it.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000
But anyway, with the Game Rakuraku machine,

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
it had different embroidery patterns

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
that you could create on there,

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
and then you would save them,

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
plug the cartridge in on the sewing machine,

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
and it would do the embroidery for you.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
And as this, you know, kept going,

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000
they actually did other versions of this machine in Japan.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Now, of course, we got the one, the Isaac,

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000
but the other ones that came out overseas

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
were different models.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000
There was the JN-2000.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
It had an improved model that used

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
a different external embroidery attachment,

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.000
and it was very quick.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
There were other games that came out

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.000
that would use this embroidery attachment,

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000
including one called Mario Family,

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:25.000
which was a game where it had just different Mario...

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
I would probably say Mario World era,

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
because it was Game Boy Color stuff,

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:36.000
that would let you do different kinds of embroidery patterns.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000
They tested a Kirby one.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.000
There is video of it in use on the Kirby one.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.000
They only showed it at one of the consumer electronic shows in Japan.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:54.000
The other thing, too, is that this machine would also do text.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.000
It would do kanji, I think, up to 500 characters.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Hiragana, katakana, and romaji, which is English letters.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.000
And then, of course, there were no follow-ups past that.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000
It was pretty popular with some of the niche market.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
In the US, people were like,

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
oh, this is cool, this is cool,

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000
but there wasn't just enough interest in it.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Which, by the way, that was also, I think,

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
the same year that at one of the US electronic shows,

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:36.000
they did the knitting machine that Howard Phillips actually showed being used.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000
That was only just that prototype.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:44.000
But yeah, it was, it's an interesting idea.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
It's really neat.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
I mean, the Singer Isaac machines,

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
the thing about it is that,

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
keep in mind that this release came out around the time that like,

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000
all those colorful IMAX were out, right?

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
With all the various colors.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
These Isaac machines were no different.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.000
It had that same kind of aqua blue color.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:07.000
And, you know, that matched one of the Game Boy colors.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
But there were other rakaraku sewing machines.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000
One of them, not sewing machines, the machine, but the game.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.000
There was an embroidery one,

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.000
and then there was another one that was sort of like a stitch embellishment one.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
So yeah, there were a total of four, quote,

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:29.000
game cartridges that were released to be used with the sewing machine.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.000
And I know it's not technically a peripheral,

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:39.000
but it is a piece of gaming history and something that's meant to work with it.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:45.000
For example, the Jaguar release that came out in Japan

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000
actually had a little docking station for a Game Boy

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.000
that you would plug it directly into the Game Boy while it had the game running on it.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
And then with the embroidery attachment.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.000
So, it's pretty neat.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:02.000
I wouldn't, you know, I'd be lying if I said I didn't want one.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
I would like one.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000
But, again, I don't have 1,400 bucks for it.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:13.000
So, there you go. That's your peripheral of the month.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000
And, of course, you can imagine not a lot of people really know about this,

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
or they're hearing about this for the first time.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
So, some comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
I'll find a picture of it for everyone.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
SJ100Matt says, I did not know this existed.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Looking at it now, it's pretty impressive that the Game Boy Color could handle this.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Yeah, so that's kind of neat.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000
I put a link to one of the articles I got my information from,

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
so you can see the US one.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Yeah.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.000
It's pretty neat. The Jaguar one is all red.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:44.000
And then I actually found a place that's selling them.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
So, if anyone wants one that has 400 bucks for it,

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.000
and is going to be selfish to not buy me one, I'll link it for you.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.000
All right. Well, there it is, your classic peripheral of the month.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
We are going to take a break, but when we come back,

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come,

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
including some more rapid-fire news.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
We're going to get into release dates as well,

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.000
and your calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype,

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:12.000
when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio,

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:27.000
live with our 740th episode already in progress for tonight, August 5th, 2018,

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
taping live as we always do at the Voice of Geeks Network,

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
where we just got back from a little music break.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000
And I can't help but read some of the chat happening during the music break.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
So, Bobby shared a link with you about Animal Crossing.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000
I am putting this actually on my fan page.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Yeah? What is this?

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
How grammar works in Animal Crossing, apparently.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
So, it does grade you on grammar?

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Yeah, it has, like, certain – they're very simple rules,

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:52.000
but, like, you have to, like, whenever you put in a punctuation mark,

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
like a period or exclamation or, you know,

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000
you have to use a capital letter within three characters after.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.000
So, it counts for doing the double space after a period.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Oh, so it lets you do either way.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Yeah.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Why would it let you do the wrong way? I'm just kidding.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000
So, I can write, you know, Bob – Bobra and say, like,

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
you are the most smartest person in the village.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
The person did a period space, a period space,

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
just nothing but a letter full of it.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.000
But if you do, like, I think more than 75 characters

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.000
without any capital letters or punctuation,

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000
you get scored down 150 points.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Wow.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Yeah, so –

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Interesting.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
It's really cool. I'm going to post it up on my fan page.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Okay. That's – who knew?

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Still wish Nintendo would announce a new Animal Crossing game already,

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
but I suppose nothing else yet.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
We'll see what they are announcing around the gaming world

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
as we quickly look at some rapid fire news.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Loki.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
All right.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:53.000
So, we talked about last week what the Xbox Games with Gold lineup is,

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:58.000
and now it's time for the PlayStation Plus free games for August.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
So, starting off from PlayStation 4,

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.000
we have Mafia III and Dead by Daylight.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:08.000
On PlayStation 3, Bound by Flame and Serious Sam III BFE.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:14.000
And finally, on PlayStation Vita, Draw Slasher and Space Hulk.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
So, those are your free games.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Mafia III looks pretty cool. I'll have to check that out.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
But neat.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.000
And then a game I've been looking forward to

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
and finally is going to be coming out.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Unfortunately, someone –

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
I know that we had a story a few weeks ago

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:34.000
about how an iOS publisher had ripped it off

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
and made a clone game out of it,

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000
but Donut Country is a game that's going to be coming out to PlayStation 4

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000
and PC and iOS on August 28th.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
For those not familiar with it,

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:49.000
it is kind of like a katamari game.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
It's a little bit of a reverse katamari.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Basically, you control a hole that gets bigger as you drop things into it.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000
And so, as you drop, you start with smaller things and then larger things,

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
and you solve puzzles doing that and stuff.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.000
And it's got a funny little raccoon that's like the main character in the game.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Trash panda.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Definitely worth checking out.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
I'm very excited to play this.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.000
I've been looking forward to it ever since I saw the first trailer for it.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
I'll play Trash Panda the game.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
I do wish Namco would make a new katamari damashi game already.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
This is not mobile.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Not the katamari tapping game and that crap.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
I want a legit new game.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
But one thing that Namco is doing

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
is that they're putting out Donkey – excuse me,

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000
they're not putting that out, but they're putting out Taiku no Tatsujin

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
out here in the west as well as Europe.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
But apparently it's going to be digital only,

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
both places, even though there was box art floating around out there.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
It's going to be digital only, both places after all.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000
They're not releasing the actual taiko drum,

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
which, in my opinion,

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000
completely fucking defeats the purpose of Taiku no Tatsujin.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000
But all right, I suppose there's some people that will play button button mode.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.000
But you can, on the Nintendo Switch, use Donkey Konga bongos.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000
That's why I started to say donkey, because the story is about that.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:00.000
If you actually use the GameCube adapter with your Switch,

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
you can plug in Donkey Konga bongos,

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
and you can play Taiku no Tatsujin with that,

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:09.000
if, you know, you have Donkey Konga bongos still sitting around somewhere.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Good luck with that.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:14.000
I mean, I guess maybe you could still find them at a thrift store.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Yeah, eBay or a thrift store or something.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Locally, you know, was it like Dimple?

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Man, if you want anything retro game, everything.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:27.000
But I do think it's a bonehead move to at least let a special order or something.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000
At least do, like, an Amazon or, you know, a store.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Play Asia.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Well, not even, like, just like some type of, like, US release or something.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Like, it would be really nice if Namco would support that,

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.000
because I kind of think they're just setting this game up to fail otherwise.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.000
So, which is a bummer for all the Taiku no Tatsujin fans out there.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000
But I guess there's some people that'll tap the screen or use their buttons,

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000
but it's just, it's not the same thing.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Anyway, Beatmania 2DX still trucking along after all these years with the location test of 26th style,

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.000
although they stopped calling them my numbers a long time ago.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:12.000
This particular version is called Beatmania 2DX Rootage is the name of it.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Rootage, if you want to be fancy. R-O-O-T-A-G-E, Rootage.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Well, Rootage, that just makes me think of watching all those Guy Tang videos.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Yeah.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:26.000
With him talking about, we're going to do a Chateau Root on her Rootage.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.000
So, the location test happened this past weekend.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Our pals at Bimani Style have a nice little write-up on it if you want to see some of the artwork from the game and so forth.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000
It looks like they might be, like, making the How to Play stickers general,

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.000
so they don't have to keep updating it with every release and stuff.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000
They might be making some changes to how high speed works.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
There's apparently 10 different high speed settings now,

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000
and it all scrolls the same regardless of the song's BPM.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:54.000
So, that's kind of neat, although it does point out the BPM changes will still happen within a song.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000
You can also do playlists through QR codes, kind of interesting.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:03.000
But, other things that I thought was very interesting is that I was looking at the song list,

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000
and, you know, it's a lot of stuff I don't follow as much as I used to,

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
although some of the artists are still there after all these years.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Kors K, still there. A new song called Wonderland, and so forth.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:22.000
But I thought this was interesting is that Porter Robinson has a song in Beat Media 2DX Rootage, or 26.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:27.000
It's under his alias that he puts music out under now called Virtual Self,

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
and the song is called Particle Arts.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.000
So, if you've listened to that EP on Spotify or what have you,

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
that song is actually going to be in Beat Media 2DX,

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:40.000
and he actually tweeted about that on his account, Virtual Self, the song in the game, so that's there.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:46.000
I think that's kind of notable because Porter Robinson was kind of known for, or is kind of known for,

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:51.000
he has directly cited Bamani music as some of his influence as being a DJ.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:56.000
He's the one that will drop Look to the Sky and shit in the middle of his DJing and stuff when he does those things.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.000
I think he just did a big gig at Vegas, I think it was a big electronic festival in Vegas a couple weeks ago,

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:06.000
because I think our pal DNL was there, so I think she was posting stuff from his set and stuff.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.000
So anyway, it's kind of interesting how that's come full circle,

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:16.000
is that stuff like Beat Media and Bamani influenced this guy, he's a young guy, he's only in his early 20s,

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:23.000
influenced him and now he is influencing future Beat Media games by having one of his songs in it.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:28.000
So, if you want to hear the song, it's on Spotify, Apple Music, all those places.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Again, Porter Robinson now kind of goes by Virtual Self, he's one of those musical artists that changes his name,

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:39.000
and the song is called Particle Arts, if you want a little preview of what that will sound like on the soundtrack.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:43.000
So, that's it for me, DarkSakura, what do you have for Rapid Fire News?

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Some stuff. Basically, the Nintendo Switch for the June 2018 report,

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:59.000
actually is the only system that had software sales that increased over that particular quarter,

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:05.000
but that's not all, the NES Classic was the number one best-selling hardware.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:11.000
So, they beat out the PS4. Suck it, Sony!

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:23.000
So, the NES Classic sold more than the PS4. Funny how those things can sell when you actually put them on shelves.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Funny how that works, right, Logie?

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Yeah, it is funny how that works. It makes sense, though, because it was unavailable for the longest time,

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000
and then now, I don't think there was any really big games coming out in June.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:42.000
No, it's been a slow month for console, but still, you have to appreciate the novelty of,

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:50.000
here we are in the year 2018, and the best-selling gaming system of last month was the Nintendo Entertainment System.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.000
People were worried they weren't going to be able to get it. They thought it was going to be limited.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Guilty!

01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Anyway, in other news, Mario Kart 4 Wii is showing up on Nvidia Shield in China,

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:08.000
which is basically how they get pretty much any Nintendo game, is it has to show up on Nvidia Shield.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:13.000
That's how they got all the N64 titles that came out of there.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Yeah, Nvidia has some agreement with Nintendo, but it's like for China.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Yeah, because I saw someone, maybe a Eurogamer, looking at the emulator with it and stuff,

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:29.000
and saying that it's upresing some of the textures, or upresing the geometry, but not the texture.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:34.000
I don't know, something like that. But it's like its own unique emulator that's running the stuff,

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.000
because they have, Mario Galaxy was one of the games that was on there.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Yeah, that's it.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.000
I think they might be editing some of the games, too, because I thought I heard that...

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Well, they have to.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Well, not like... Well, yeah. Is China the country where you can't show skeletons,

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.000
where they had to change the undead in World of Warcraft because you can't show skeletons?

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
I don't know.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Was it zombies?

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Well, because I'm thinking of Dry Bones, the turtle. Wasn't he a playable...

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
But there's other things that they have to edit out, too.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Well, and not just that, but I was thinking more like the multiplayer, I believe they had called out,

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.000
which is not going to be in the Mario Kart Wii. They removed it, basically.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Sorry, online multiplayer specifically. Obviously, in the same room is what Mario Kart's known for.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:22.000
That's still there. But the online multiplayer has been removed.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
So, interesting.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
I mean, it makes sense, but...

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:34.000
I think the thought that it's running on a Tegra-based console is that,

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Hey, Nintendo has a Tegra-based console. Could we possibly get some of this shit on the Switch, please?

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Hmm. Hey.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.000
The plot thickens.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000
But, no. Probably not.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:53.000
All right. Well, let's talk about some things that are coming out a little sooner than Virtual Console,

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.000
or whatever Nintendo's doing next. It's release dates. What's coming out this week?

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Yeah, I was going to talk about releasing the game that I was working on,

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:04.000
and talk about lowering the bars for expectations and stuff.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Even lower than what we would expect for the Virtual Console stuff.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.000
But anyways, this week we've got a few things.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:19.000
So, starting off on PC, Mac and Linux, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.000
We have Dead Cells, which is a roguelike Metroidvania game.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Flipping Death on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Overcooked 2 on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Layton's Mystery Journey DX on a Nintendo Switch.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.000
I didn't even realize there was a Professor Layton game coming to the Switch.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Minute, which is pretty awesome looking, and that's also coming to the Switch.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Monster Hunter World on PC, Okami HD on the Nintendo Switch, Yakuza 3,

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.000
I'm assuming the remaster on PlayStation 4.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:06.000
And then we've got Football, Madden NFL 19 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
No one buys that stuff.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:14.000
And finally, I guess coming out of Early Access, We Happy Few on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.000
It feels early for Madden to be released, but I guess August is the month.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
It is August. I guess so.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000
They used to tend towards the end of the month, but...

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Maybe they want to get the kids before they're back in school.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Or, well, shit, kids are going back to school next week.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.000
It feels like they go back earlier and earlier.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
So, wow.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Well, anyhow, let's go to Japan and talk about what's coming out there.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.000
On the PlayStation 4 in Japan this week, Bullet Girls Fantasia.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.000
If you want to check that out from D3, that's out this week on PS4.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Darkest Dungeon, as well as Fire Pro Wrestling World.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Jake Hunter Detective Story, Prism of Eyes.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.000
That Bullet Girls Fantasia also has a limited edition version.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.000
There's a remaster of Ryu Ga Gotoku 3.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
And there is...

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Oh, that's it.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Because the rest I'm looking at is for the next week after that.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
So that's what you have on the Vita this week.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Looking at the Nintendo Switch, some of those same games are also out on the Switch, including Darkest Dungeon.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Jake Hunter Detective Story, Prism of Eyes.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.000
The Layton's Mysterious Journey, that is also out in Japan this week.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
That same one that Loki referenced.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Also out in Japan this week on the Switch.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Okami.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.000
So the Switch port of Okami is out this week, so that's pretty cool.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
And then Waku Waku Sweets.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:31.000
My Okashi Ga Dekiru Kana comes out this week on the Switch.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
And I'm trying to see if this is something I would recognize.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Because it's from a company called Sonic Power.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
But no, sadly it has something to do with Sonic the Hedgehog.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
It's happy sweets making.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.000
It's basically, let's learn how to make a cake.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Is basically what it is.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Go bake me a cake.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Yeah, go bake me a cake.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:54.000
But it has this cute, look at this cute little doggy that wears a necklace made out of strawberries with this big pink bow.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:59.000
And I just want to take that cute little puppy and say, go make me a cake, bitch.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
I can say that because it's a dog.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Only because it's a female dog.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
This reminds me of Cooking Mama.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:10.000
And Cooking Mama, let's be fair, I know Waluigi is really a big contender for Smash.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000
But Cooking Mama should really be a character in Smash.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Loki, you still don't want to hear about this, but I saw the most amazing tweet this week.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:23.000
It was a guy dressed up as Waluigi, but it was completely in leather gear.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:32.000
So he was wearing a Waluigi leather hat and little leather and showing off the chest and all that stuff.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Guys that are in the leather do.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
And I was just like, that's art.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Alternative costume.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.000
I think it was actually a bearded drag performer who did it.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.000
I think it was, I'll find it in our soccer so you can see it.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:50.000
This is something I can see one of your buddies here locally doing.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:54.000
So anyway, but first UK releases while I try to find that.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Overcooked 2 comes out on August 7th for PlayStation 4, Xbone, and Switch.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:07.000
On the PC we have Quake Champion Scale Bearer Edition on August 9th.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:13.000
And then on the 10th we have Madden 19, who gives a shit.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:18.000
And We Happy Few for several different systems.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
And that is it.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
I have to see the leather daddy.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Helvetica is the name of the queen that did that.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Girl.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.000
But a bearded drag performer, so.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Some of that's photoshopped.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.000
You think?

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000
I think it is.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.000
I don't know.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.000
The eyeshadow looks legit.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000
The nose.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:36.000
I think the nose is legit.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:37.000
I think that's photoshopped.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.000
It is?

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Alright, maybe.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Unless he's got some really good pigment.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:42.000
I still laughed.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:43.000
That cracked me up.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Alright.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Anyway.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Honestly it's the little mustache coming right out of his nostril that looks like it's painted

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.000
on in Photoshop.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Akuma Wants A Link.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
I figured some of you would want this.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
It's Helvetica Queen.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
But it's not spelled the way you would think.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000
It's not spelled like the font.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:03.000
H-E-L-L-V-E-T-I-K-A.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Queen.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:08.000
And then it would be on their Twitter feed if you want to see that.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Alright.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Anyhow, I can't believe I just gave out that tweet on there.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Alright.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
I thought it was.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
I was like, that's a good idea.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000
That was well done.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Alright, anyway.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Let's get to the mailbag.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Every week you guys send us emails.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Although I don't remember if we got any this week.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
But I suppose our soccer's gonna tell me in a minute here.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is where you send emails and we read them here on error,

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
which we're gonna do right now.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000
One.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Uno.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Rob, I was watching your stream this week of No Man's Sky.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:45.000
I know you'll probably mention it in your gaming week.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:48.000
I was curious to know what you think of the update.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Is it something you will continue to play?

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Also, I was wondering about the multiplayer.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
I know you can have up to four people in your game,

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.000
but I can't understand what the point is in naming a creature that you discover

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.000
or making your base discoverable for other players when it seems to be invite only.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000
I'm gonna jump in.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Awkward, but I think we actually did do this one last week.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Oh, okay.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.000
I seem to remember responding to it, but it was after you.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Then delete the mail.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.000
I checked the date.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
He's getting rusty in his old age.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.000
I do.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Here's the thing.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.000
I'm spoiled.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Cursing on Bobby's show.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Remember when we had major problems with the emails

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
and we weren't able to log into the mailbag?

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.000
I had them all forwarded to my personal account,

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
and I just never turned that off,

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
so I just read them from my personal account.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Sorry, Jamie.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Well, now the box is empty.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000
I've even moved that Street Fighter IV code into another folder.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Fair enough.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.000
DarkSakura's cleaning up the mess in the inbox.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.000
I'm always cleaning up after.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.000
What is it that we threaten to do if the box is empty?

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.000
I forget what we were gonna be talking about.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Something that was really...

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.000
We were gonna email each other?

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Oh, yeah, there was something we were gonna talk about

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
that was gonna be really offensive.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000
I don't remember what it was.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
It wasn't offensive to your senses, basically.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
What is the most offensive thing?

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
I'll just let DarkSakura talk about it.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.000
You know what?

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Dick cheese.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Okay, no, no, no, no.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Here it is.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Dick cheese is pretty offensive, though.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Official punishment to the listeners.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
As punishment for not emailing us in the past week,

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
I am going to ask DarkSakura more information

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.000
about her trip to the Bolt.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.000
So tell me more about your trip to the Leather Daddy Bar.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Actually, my trip to the Bolt was really otherwise uneventful.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000
No, but I ordered a Lynchburg lemonade.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Okay.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.000
And they didn't have lemonade,

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000
so they made it out of sour mix and triple sec.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.000
So I was toasty by that point,

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.000
so I decided to get in the leather harness swing

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000
and sit in it like it was a toddler swing

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.000
and swing back and forth on stage at the Bolt.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:50.000
And then I got a picture of one of the other sisters

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000
with her legs spread way out up on the chain,

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
because you know what the harness looks like.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Have you been to the Bolt?

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Yeah, I've seen it.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
I haven't been in it, but I've seen it.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.000
It's a four-chain leather harness

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
that's got a big leather seat in the middle.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
And so I was sitting on there swinging

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
like I was in grade school,

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.000
and then I got down and then we went in the back seat

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
and I saw chickens fucking.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
At least it looked like it.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
The chickens, okay, I think they were all,

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
there were chickens in the backyard.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
It's been a while since I've been in the bars,

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
but I don't remember any of this stuff.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000
This is the Bolt.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
This is the CE bar close to the suburbs.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
It's the leather bar, but it has a backyard.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
And I don't think chickens actually-

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.000
It's actually fine.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
It's not as scandalous as she makes it sound.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
But they were these different hens

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
that seemed like they were all just humping each other

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000
for some reason.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
And I'm like, what the fuck are you chickens doing?

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
And then apparently there's rabbits back there too,

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.000
but I know about that.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:46.000
And then I went back in and watched more gay porn.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
All right, there you go, listeners.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Your punishment for not sending us any emails this week.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
For the record.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
And if you continue to not email us,

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
we will have more stories from Dark Soccer's weekends.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
For the record, bottoms Y.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Now I know why-

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Enough, enough punishment, enough.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Save it for next week, just in case.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
All right, let's get to some more video.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
If you haven't already turned off the show,

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:14.000
let's get to some more video game news, Loki.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
My freaking ears!

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Uh, so let's talk a little.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.000
This is almost as offensive as what we were just listening to.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Um, microtransactions in Gran Turismo Sport.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
They promised.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.000
They said, hey, we're not gonna put microtransactions in this game.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.000
And then sure enough, with the July update for Gran Turismo Sport,

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:38.000
it added new tracks, more cars, oh, and microtransactions.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
They said that they weren't gonna do it.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Um, so basically,

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.000
um, you can purchase cars outright,

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
as long as, I guess,

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000
they're less than two million in in-game currency.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Um, apparently,

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
what's gonna change is that,

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.000
um, for now, I guess you're gonna be able to buy cars,

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
I guess, for real money, too.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
So they're listing them for, like, three bucks

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000
in, uh, the PlayStation Store.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
If you don't wanna grind for,

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
you know, I guess the Alpine Vision.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Gran Turismo 2017.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Um...

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
I don't know.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
I'm not surprised anymore, you know what?

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.000
It's just the way this stuff is going.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Gotta make all of the money.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
If you're willing to pay it,

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
they're willing to sell it.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
But it's kinda lame, like,

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:34.000
maybe even a little bit disingenuous that they

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
promise that they're not gonna do it.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
They sell you the copy of the game,

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
patch it in later, and it's like...

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Welp.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Yeah, that's a little...

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Too fucking bad for you. You already paid it.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
You know, paid the money.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
It's like, you know...

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000
But there's excuses gonna be,

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
oh, we're giving player choice,

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000
or something like this.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
You don't have to grind in-game.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:55.000
You can...

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Our game isn't worth grinding in.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Spend the money to not play the game.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.000
That never made any sense to me.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Especially way after the fact.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
It makes you, like, not even wanna connect your game online

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
to get these types of patches, you know what I mean?

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
It's just like, you know, the other games, too.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Shadow of War, where they, like, had the microtransactions in there,

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
and the room, the balancing of the game.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000
And then, like, months later, after nobody's using that shit anymore,

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000
then they're like,

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000
oh, we're doing the good thing and taking it out.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Look how awesome we are.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.000
See, we listen.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
We listen to you, consumer.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Alright, real quick, before we move on,

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Bobby's being that guy in chat,

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:31.000
saying, Devil's Advocate, the price of the cars doesn't change.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:35.000
So, I guess you can still get them the old way, if you want.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Right, but it's the fact that they're offering that in the first place,

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.000
as an incentive.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
They're making the grind.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
I'm assuming the grind is diff-

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.000
It is a grind.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
If it was easy, then it wouldn't be an incentive.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000
It's basically an unlock code.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
DJ Max did the same thing not that long ago.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
They put out a thing that you can download to, like,

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
just basically unlock all of the songs.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Anyway.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Just wanna say, um, it was announced in chat.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Thank you, SSJ100Matt.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:05.000
SonicFox just won the Dragon Ball FighterZ championship.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
First suit and all.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
We have a victor who is a furry.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Okay, fun. Work.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000
I watched him play.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
I think he was the Ten Shinhan player.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
I saw an interview with him somewhere, so.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Pretty, pretty crazy.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Props to them, but my god, that's gotta be fucking hot.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.000
That's gotta be so hot.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000
I know, that's the only thing.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Like, I don't even think about the things that people say about, like,

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000
furries and that and all this.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Like, I don't even care.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Like, I'm just like, that guy's gotta be fucking sweating in there.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Maybe he's got fans and all that stuff. I don't know.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
No, not this. This first suit doesn't.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.000
I mean, it looks like his first suit is really just, like,

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:39.000
the arm pieces and the thing.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:43.000
But he was, when I watched him play last night, he was, um,

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.000
just wearing a furry hat.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Not the full suit.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Okay, I mean, that's just.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
I can imagine, like, if they have some sort of stage lighting,

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
so that shit's gotta be fucking cooking.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.000
SSJ100Matt says he only wore the head after the match has ended.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Okay, that's a little better.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Okay, we'll do that.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.000
But still.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Yeah.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Still, I'm like, oh my god, I'd pass out.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Alright, anyway.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Uh, thank you for the update.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Uh, another update for you guys.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000
I don't know if anyone's using Gamefly, the streaming.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Weren't they? Didn't they used to be a mail order service?

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Yeah.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Well, they switched to streaming some time ago,

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
so they're, like, a streaming only service, and.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
I didn't know they had streaming.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Yeah, they kind of shifted to that, and now they're gonna be gone gone.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Uh, because Gamefly, uh, got acquired by EA, so.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Well, well, throw in the towel.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
They're gonna consume yet another country.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Hey, this time they're even going outside of game developers.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Hey, fuck it. We're gonna eat in this company now.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000
It's, uh, it's, uh.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Gotta feed the devil.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.000
The Grim Reaper's just pointing, just sign here.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Anyway, Bobby says they are still mail order.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
They never shifted away, so I guess they, that is still.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.000
I thought they, I thought they, I heard they had closed it down.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Because I, I, maybe I just ended my account at some point.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
But I thought I'd heard they closed down. Anyway.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Uh, so Gamefly's gonna shut down the streaming service, uh,

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:02.000
because, uh, EA, uh, got them.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Uh, Gamefly streaming launched in 2015 as part of Amazon Fire TV,

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:10.000
and now it's built into a lot of Samsung TVs and so forth.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.000
You can still get games on the mail discs, so that is still a thing that happens.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Uh, but Gamefly streaming's closure, uh, is happening

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:22.000
when it seems like game streaming is, like, still a thing that's growing out there.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:26.000
I mean, if you look at PlayStation Now, or you're looking at, uh,

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
you know, what Microsoft's been doing.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Uh, EA, of course, also has its own thing, the Origin Access Premier.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.000
So I don't know if maybe some of what, of course,

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.000
well, maybe some of the things that Gamefly had, they're gonna fold into it

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:44.000
to make that more attractive or whatever. I don't know.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:50.000
How can we micro, or how can we add microtransactions to game streaming?

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Because I'm sure that's what they would want to know.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Fucking hate EA. Seriously.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Alright. Well, anyhow, I learned today that Gamefly is still around.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:04.000
I seriously thought they had gone under years ago.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Maybe I'm mixing them up with, um, I must be mixing them up with somebody else.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Is there another? Well, I knew about that one.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.000
But, yeah, I used to get dissed from them too, and then it just kind of stopped.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:18.000
I don't know. Anyway, maybe I did cancel it when I wasn't paying attention.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Uh, Bobby says, uh, I'm mixing them up with OnLive, maybe.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Maybe that's it. Maybe I'm mixing them up with OnLive,

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
even though I know OnLive was a streaming thing.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
But anyway, let's move on. It doesn't matter anymore.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Dark Sakura, you got another story for us.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Yes, I do have another story.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Um, in this story, it has to do with King of Fighters.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.000
And Pokemon Go-ish stuff.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:43.000
It's basically an augmented reality the King of Fighters Go.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Um, you wander around picking up different fighters and fighting them,

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:51.000
and then they join your repertoire.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Yeah, you just keep building teams to fight other, other players.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:02.000
So, um, it looks interesting. I guess it should be fun.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:05.000
I don't see, I don't know if it's going to come out in the US, though.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Maybe it's still in testing?

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:10.000
But yeah, it's supposed to be doing, it was originally titled, um,

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.000
King of Fighters the Orochi Saga Go,

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:19.000
which means it was based around the 95, 97 Orochi Saga from the game.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:24.000
So, the beta was from July 27th through July 31st

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:28.000
for iPhone, uh, using TestFlight.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
And the Android beta is unannounced.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:34.000
But maybe, maybe we'll see it. Who knows?

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Now, this is a Go game I would check out.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
It can't be worse than Garfield Go.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Like, you want to, and that Jurassic Park game.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:44.000
My sister is, she plays that game, the Jurassic Park one,

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
and she's like, you gotta play this game.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.000
I'm like, no.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.000
It's, it's okay. It's better than the Garfield one,

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:51.000
but it's just, it's not Pokemon.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Garfield's just crap.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Yeah, the Garfield one is garbage.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.000
But I play, I check out King of Fighters.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
It was Garfield bitch.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Anyway, um, so I, I hate to keep going back to this,

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000
but Evo is going on, I suppose.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
And this, this just came across my Twitter feed.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:10.000
So, uh, SonicFox, who just won, uh, tweeted this, uh, five minutes ago.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:15.000
I'm gay. Also the best DBFZ player on this fucking planet.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Don't forget it.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Awesome.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
To which I respond, work bitch.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:25.000
So yeah, the, and I looked at the bio for, uh, this individual.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:29.000
I'm a black queer furry who will mixture shit in fighting games.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Own it, live it, love it, work.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
That's all I have to say about that.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:35.000
I am now a fan.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:39.000
I need to find that tweet just so I can go, yes, bitch.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Uh, it's, um, his Twitter is SonicFox5000.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Okay.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:46.000
There you go.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.000
All right.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Let's, uh, let's continue on.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Uh, Loki, just another story for us.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:52.000
And then, uh, just a couple more.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
We're gonna get to the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:55.000
all one word on Skype.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
So I'm probably gonna have a controversial opinion about this,

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:00.000
but let's just talk about the story first and then we'll get to that.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:06.000
So there is this little girl by the name of, um, Penny McDonald,

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:10.000
and she has released her debut game, Answer the Question, on Steam.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Um, what's notable is Penny is only seven years old,

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
and apparently since she was a toddler,

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:18.000
she has been interested in making games.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
I guess her dad is a game developer,

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:23.000
and she even started with learning, um, you know,

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Windows 98 learning in QBasic and that kind of stuff.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
And so now she's released her.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:33.000
She released her text game, um, onto Steam,

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:36.000
and it's cute that it's on there.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.000
And so it's basically this terminal-looking game

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:45.000
where you answer math questions, and that's it for 99 cents.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:48.000
So here's where I get controversial about it.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.000
I think it's great that she's releasing a game.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Why is it on Steam?

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Yes.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Why the fuck is it on Steam?

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Like, I get it.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:58.000
I'm all for her releasing a game.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:02.000
That's where itch.io is a great place to do that, okay?

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.000
This shit does not need to be on Steam.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
I mean, I guess I shouldn't judge

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:10.000
because there's a lot of garbage on Steam,

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:15.000
but if this was anybody else making a game,

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:18.000
it would just be like, why the fuck is this on Steam?

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
And it's just because she's a little girl, and that's fine.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
You know, encourage her to make games,

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:25.000
but it does not belong on Steam.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.000
It doesn't. It just doesn't.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:34.000
I don't want to, like, crap on a seven-year-old's game.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:37.000
And I haven't played the game, so I can't speak to the quality.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
But, you know, to be fair, it's fine.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:42.000
It's gonna get buried under the garbage that is Steam anyway.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:45.000
So whatever. I guess it's not really hurting anything,

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:48.000
but it's not helping anything either.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
It's great. Good for her.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
I hope she keeps channeling that energy

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
into continuing to make good games

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:58.000
and so forth, but yeah, it is a little weird that, you know,

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:01.000
you're right, it's gonna get buried under all the other garbage on Steam.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Yeah, it's her first game, and that's fine, but...

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.000
I'm not gonna release... Okay.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:10.000
I showed Rob what my first game is.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
It's not even my first game.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
He did show me during the break.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
It does exist. I've seen it.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:19.000
But I'm not releasing that shit on Steam.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:23.000
No. I'm not doing that, because it's garbage.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
It's just to learn. I mean...

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
You should call a seven-year-old's game garbage.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
I'm not saying it's garbage. I'm saying, like, it's QBasic.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.000
And QBasic, that's what you expect out of QBasic, is that shit.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
It's limited.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
It's very limited, and...

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.000
I'm...

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Great, but polish that up and then release it.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.000
It's like, just because you make your first game,

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
does that mean it's ready to be published?

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Make more games. Make a dozen more games.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:55.000
And then when you get, like, a really polished game, then release it.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:00.000
But I don't say, I guess there's no harm that it's on there,

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.000
because it's not really taking up marketplace space, but it's...

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:08.000
It's just showing that Steam has no quality control.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Because, not even, at least this is a functional game.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
And it works.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:16.000
We're gonna assume she did not implement a Bitcoin miner in the game.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Right. That'd be the twist.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Why are my resources so high?

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
There's, like, text on the screen, and that's it.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
All you gullible people that fell for the...

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:29.000
No, I shouldn't even say that. I'm sorry. I shouldn't say that.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:31.000
And then that's cool.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.000
And I used to make games like you and basic as well,

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:39.000
but I'm not gonna go grab that shit and say it's ready for publishing.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:40.000
I don't know.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:43.000
I just, that's where I have kind of a little bit of an issue with it,

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.000
but, you know, I'm glad that she's trying...

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
She's trying... You know, it's actually...

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Wait, the color is kind of a tangent a little bit.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
I don't know if you remember,

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:56.000
there was a Kickstarter campaign

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.000
that was this person's first game,

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000
and they were, I think, seven or eight years old as well,

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
and it was, like, an RPG.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
She wanted to make an RPG an RPG maker,

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:09.000
and it was, like, a troll quest thing or something like that.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
She was gonna fight against the internet trolls

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:14.000
because people were saying that this Kickstarter campaign was bullshit

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:17.000
because she wanted, like, thousands of dollars to build

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
what essentially is an RPG maker game.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.000
It's like that only got attention because of the age.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
This is only getting attention because it's age as well.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.000
But I think where I agree,

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:34.000
she should make games, she should put them out there, not on Steam.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.000
That's where I'm at.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:36.000
All right.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
So, you know, people want to fight you in chat, so here we go.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Bobby is starting off going,

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:41.000
so where does it belong?

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Somebody did respond.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:43.000
You'd mentioned itch.io.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Bobby said,

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
I released my first game in middle school,

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
and four people bought it.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.000
That's four more people than would have never bought it

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:52.000
if I'd not published it.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
But you could put it on itch.io,

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
you can sell it on itch.io,

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
and I see no problem with that.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:03.000
The great thing about PC games is you can self-publish all you want.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Yeah, you can do that.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000
It just doesn't need to be...

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Priz, back when Bobby was in middle school,

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:11.000
I'm assuming those were the days of shareware and BBSes and all that stuff,

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.000
which is how we kinda sold our games.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.000
You know what? And that's fine.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:17.000
I guess, you know, at this point in the condition Steam is in,

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
what's it gonna hurt?

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
I mean, I just think in the bigger picture,

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Steam should have some quality control stuff.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:27.000
I don't totally disagree with you, Loki.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:32.000
I get that you're pointing out that this is a Q basic game,

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:33.000
and you don't want to...

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:34.000
It's not even a Q basic game.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:37.000
I think it's something, but it resembles a basic game.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
You don't want to crap on the efforts of a little girl.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
You want to see her succeed,

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:44.000
but Steam is maybe not, because this kind of exacerbates

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.000
what the issue is with Steam,

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:50.000
is that Steam will let literally anything in its door

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
when that is not what Steam used to be.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Steam was a heavy, curated place that had these, you know,

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:00.000
indie games and big AAA games alike and so forth,

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:04.000
and then it just is kind of turned into the Google Play App Store at some point,

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
where it's just everything and anything.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Right, and that's kind of where I'm at with it.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:10.000
It's just like...

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
I don't know. I don't know really how to react to this.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:18.000
I mean, I guess it's cool that she's got a game that she's publishing.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Cool.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:20.000
I mean...

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:22.000
I don't know.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
I went through a C++ course.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:27.000
The first one I did was...

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:29.000
It was terminal.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
It was making terminal games,

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:36.000
and one of those was like a roulette or slot machine game

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:37.000
or something like that.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:40.000
That would be like if I published that on Steam.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Like, it's shit, okay?

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Like, the fact that a seven-year-old made it,

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:48.000
it makes it less shit because it's like,

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
wow, this is pretty amazing for a seven-year-old.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Like, if my son made that, that's great.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
I would be like, wow, that's pretty awesome that you made a game.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:57.000
I would not go to publish it on Steam, though.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:58.000
I would say no.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
I'm like, hey, if you want to...

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
We can try to sell a couple copies.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:06.000
I'll put it up on itch.io and I'll tweet out some stuff to my friends

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.000
and we'll see if someone wants to buy it for $0.99,

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
because that's all it is, is $0.99.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
But I'm not going to put it on Steam.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Even if it was my own kid making a game that looked exactly like that,

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:19.000
I would not put that on Steam,

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
because I know that's not where it belongs.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:23.000
I don't know.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Like, if somebody bakes a cake in an Easy-Bake oven,

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:30.000
you don't go put it on the fucking grocery store shelf

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
to sell it next to the cakes that they make.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Actually, you put it on YouTube to make it a specialty channel.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, I'm going to go back to this point.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Why is it okay for itch.io to have garbage and not Steam?

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Shouldn't we be arguing for quality control for all?

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:44.000
I actually...

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
No, I think there is a difference between the two.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:50.000
I think itch.io is, by nature, an experimental playground,

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
and there is less curation that goes on there,

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:55.000
and that is both part of what makes it great

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
is because you are going to find things there

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
that you are not going to find anything else

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
because of, by nature, what it is,

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
and it's also going to make it, yeah,

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
you're going to play a lot of garbage that's on itch.io,

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:09.000
but when you go to itch.io, you know that's what it is.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:12.000
And they also have kind of like blog stuff too,

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:16.000
like it's a big old like, hey, I'm seven and this is my first game,

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
and you can talk a little bit about it and stuff.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
I mean, I guess you could do that on Steam as well,

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
but Steam is like a commercial marketplace.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.000
itch.io, I don't really...

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
I mean, I know they sell games on itch.io,

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:28.000
but I'm not like, I'm getting the new release games on itch.io.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:32.000
It's the indie record store versus, I guess, Walmart,

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
because there are no big record stores anymore.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Like, the same could be said with like GOG or something like that.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:40.000
I wouldn't want it on GOG either. I wouldn't want it on Humble Store.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:44.000
It's not viable for a commercial marketplace.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
It's a neat indie thing.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
It's cool that you made your project

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:51.000
and that you want to sell it and see if you can sell something,

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
but like, I don't understand.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Okay, for me, MXC, and we'll move on here in a minute,

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:58.000
but for me, MXC here makes a really good point in my opinion.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
I think it kind of hits what it is for me.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:04.000
I think people still have memories of when Steam was curated at all.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:07.000
So Steam, as of today, causes annoyance.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
itch.io never attempted to gatekeep,

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:12.000
and that was a huge cause for excitement with indie devs.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.000
With that said, itch.io does very well with highlighting

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:18.000
some of their best recent releases with post and front page widgets,

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
even with their own massive libraries.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
I think you said that very well, MXC.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
I do want to read this comment from Sia Tabiri as well.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Loki, I partially agree with you, but I think this might be a case of,

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
I can't hold others to the same standards I would myself and my family.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:32.000
You can't fault someone else for putting out what they might believe is their best

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
or what they believe is worthy of something,

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:38.000
even when it's not something you would personally be willing to release.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
I understand that, but it's not her that put it out.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:41.000
It's her parents that put it out,

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:44.000
because she didn't front the $100 for Steam to do all that.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:47.000
But that's fine. You know what? At this point, what's it going to hurt?

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
I mean, honestly, it's not going to hurt anything

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:52.000
because Steam is in the condition that it is.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:56.000
And to be honest, her game is probably better than a lot of the shovelwork garbage

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.000
that people put out there.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:58.000
And it's not going to be mining for Bitcoin.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:08:59.000
And it's not mining for Bitcoin.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:02.000
So she's already ahead of the pack in that sense whatsoever.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:06.000
It's 99 cents. I shouldn't really be taking offense to it.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
And it's really, I don't take offense to the game itself.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.000
I take offense to Steam.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Steam as a whole is where I have problems.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
I'm going to read one more comment and then I'm going to wrap up here

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
because I know Dark Soccer is going to be heading out in a minute.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.000
AkumaJP in chat says,

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:21.000
If there is a place for a child to place their game, I will say put it there,

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:24.000
but there's none, so I think she can put it there if she wants.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:27.000
And so I guess defer to the comment about, you know,

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:30.000
you don't have a problem with the game, you have a problem with Steam.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Right.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
And it's the same problem you said at the beginning of the show.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:34.000
I get it.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Maybe they just need a separate place for, not like Greenlight was,

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:40.000
but maybe just like the Steam Playground or something.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Yeah.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Steam IO. No, I'm just kidding. Don't call it that.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:46.000
At any rate, good for her though.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:49.000
And I hope that she's encouraged to do more with her success.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Exactly.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Like it's a tricky subject because you don't want to deter her

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
that the issue is Steam and what it is and isn't allowing.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
The issue is not that she made a game.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Good for her.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Like I hope she will channel that into making more games

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:05.000
and improving the game that she has started and continues to do that.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:08.000
So I hope that is clear in this argument.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Anyway, Dark Soccer, I know you have to head out.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Yes.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:14.000
So anything you want to say to listeners before you head out?

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:15.000
I'm fucking tired.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:19.000
No, seriously, I've had a very busy day today

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:23.000
and I've been out in the sunlight because I helped with the charity

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:27.000
carwash today this morning and it was very fun.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:34.000
We made over $400 for a Nevada County HIV testing,

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
which they have zero government support.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:37.000
Really?

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Yeah.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:39.000
They have no funding.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
So we've raised $400 for them.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Wow.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
And we're adding in another $100 from our local,

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
you know, from the sisters.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
So we are making a nice $500 donation.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Very cool.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
I'm surprised to hear about that because that,

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
we need to talk off air about some of this stuff.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Okay.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Okay.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:59.000
But at any rate, you know, it makes me feel good to do these things,

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
but at the same time, I'm really freaking tired.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Sure, of course.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:05.000
So it was, yeah, and all of you guys, you know,

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:08.000
I would encourage that if you feel something that, you know,

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:09.000
very strongly about something,

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:12.000
look into your local communities and see how you can help, you know,

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.000
even if it's volunteering at an event for a couple of hours

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:21.000
or even hosting a video game marathon to raise money for charity,

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
you know, look into that.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
I'm going to be doing the same thing for my mom,

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:28.000
probably in a couple of weeks to raise money for my mom.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:34.000
So, um, just if you care about your community, put your heart in it,

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:37.000
put your, put your actions where your mouth is.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:38.000
All right.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
And on that note, we are going to get to one more story.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.000
I still have one more story here,

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:44.000
and then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:45.000
all one word on Skype.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Before we get to Skype line, I have one more story.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
That last story took a little longer and I thought it would, uh,

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:53.000
but this story is about an undiscovered, uh, Atari 2600.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
I was going to say undiscovered country.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:59.000
No, undiscovered sequel to an Atari 2600 game that has been found all

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
these years later, basically.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:05.000
Um, it's a prototype for Keystone Capers 2.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Do you ever play Keystone Capers on Atari 2600?

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:10.000
It was the cop and robber game by Activision,

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
and it's actually a really good game.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:13.000
It was a fun little game.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
For Atari 2600 it was a really fun game.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Well, unfortunately the prototype, it isn't really like a playable thing.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
It just kind of shows the policeman running,

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:25.000
but it does show that the sequel was originally going to be set on a train.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:29.000
So it shows this train that's basically like multi-screen that, uh,

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.000
the cop is kind of running between and the effects with like the mountain in

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:35.000
the background and the scrolling with the cactuses and everything.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:38.000
The effects are pretty darn good for an Atari 2600.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:39.000
Right.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:40.000
You know what I mean? So that's, that's really neat.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:43.000
So, um, yeah, basically this ended up being kind of a tech demo.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
It's not an actual playable game or anything,

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:48.000
but I'm sure it's just a matter of time before this ROM hits the internet,

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.000
since the, uh, prototype, I guess, went to the NVGM.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.000
I'm not sure what that acronym is,

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:57.000
but I'm assuming it's some type of game museum or a, you know,

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
place that, uh, archives this type of stuff.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
So that is, that is really cool.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Um, there was some information on this game a little while ago.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Um, it's just,

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:08.000
this is the first time video has come out of it because I think he was

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
quoted in an interview and I'm a programmer.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Dan kitchen was quoted in an interview once saying, you know,

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
I did a sequel to ketone capers.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:19.000
It was a cop on a train and it was called a Keystone cannon ball was what it

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:22.000
was going to be called. Um, but this is the first time we're like seeing video.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:23.000
And again,

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:26.000
it's 2018 and we're seeing video for the first time of a game that probably

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:30.000
should have been released in around 1984. So yeah, pretty cool.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Pretty cool. Anyway, with that, the Skype line is open.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:38.000
If you'd like to give us a call about anything we've talked about tonight,

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
or maybe something we haven't talked about tonight, uh,

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
while we wait for a call to come in,

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:45.000
I don't know if we have any quick last minute stories we want to get to Loki.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Uh, I didn't. Oh yeah.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:50.000
Actually I was going to mention something as kind of a surprise this week.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:54.000
La Milana to release. No, I'm sure dark tattoo is all over that one. Yeah.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:57.000
So they, I guess announced and released it or something.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
I know I thought it was announced already. Yeah.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:02.000
They've been teasing it for awhile, but then it just kind of like came out.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
It just came out. Yeah. Cause they had a Kickstarter.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:07.000
So it's been known about for awhile. So anyway, we do have a call coming in.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Let's get to it. Hi. You're on orange laundry. Who's this? Hey, what's going on?

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:13.000
It's Rama. Hey Rama. Good to hear from you. What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Uh, not too much. Besides the fact that I hate Skype version eight,

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:20.000
but that's a story and a rant for another time. Yes, I, I,

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:24.000
I'm using this Skype windows XP until I can't anymore, but, uh,

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
we're talking about off air.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Some of the upgrades we're going to be doing pretty soon.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.000
I'm hoping by the end of the year,

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.000
it's going to be a very different sounding OLR than it is now.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
I hear you. I already told my staff,

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:38.000
we're moving to discord for this week's show. End of story. Oh, interesting.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.000
You know,

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:43.000
a lot of people are doing voice chat on discord and I've been asked if OLR is

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:47.000
going to make a move like that. And, um, TBD.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:51.000
We'll just leave it at that. Well, there is one issue with Skype eight.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:55.000
If they fixed automatic microphone control, they fix it properly.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:58.000
We're sticking around. If not, it's getting uninstalled. Simple as that.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Yikes. I still know a lot of people that use Skype.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
I always hear this argument like nobody uses Skype,

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:08.000
but I'm like all the online big brother survivor reality game stuff that I've

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:12.000
played, like they're all on Skype and they all chat with Skype regularly.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Like it's a big platform and I still think tons of people are using Skype to

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:19.000
like call family in another country and things like that.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
Like I think Skype is still like super popular.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:25.000
It just isn't popular with the techies. I think is what's happening.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:29.000
Yeah. And tech community basically using, um,

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:34.000
maybe discord, but for the most part slack and you have Microsoft teams,

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:37.000
but you got to think about it. When you install windows on your PC,

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:40.000
like windows 10 or windows eight, Skype is right there.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:43.000
So it was like an easy one to go to. Yeah, no, for sure.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:46.000
That's part of the reason why that's part of the reason why. Well, I mean, again,

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.000
we, we've been taking calls on Skype since I don't want to say before anyone,

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:53.000
but I really think before anyone, um,

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:58.000
back in like 2003 or four was our first Skype call. So, um,

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:02.000
you know, we just stuck with it. We saw no reason to leave it yet.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Yeah, basically.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:07.000
But let me say what I got to say then I'm going to get out of here so that

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:11.000
other people can join in and call and have fun. Well,

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:15.000
first thing, your threat of a punishment,

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
you got to try harder than that. Good sir.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:25.000
I tried. Somebody, somebody out there's ears were bleeding. I don't know.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
I don't know. What am I supposed to do? We had no emails.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:32.000
I had to fill the segment somehow. This is true. This is true. And, um,

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:37.000
as we all know, last weekend was the Overwatch grand finals. Yep.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Which London won, right? Yeah. I didn't watch,

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:45.000
but I was actually hanging out with some of my friends actually worked the event.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Oh, fun. Yeah. Uh, one of my friends, Cassie,

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:53.000
she was the official May cosplayer for the event. Oh, that's pretty cool.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Yeah. And, and our, I think her husband who works for Blizzard,

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:59.000
he was part of the whole tech support team and the breakdown.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:02.000
So like Sunday me, her and a few others,

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:05.000
we actually did like a little walking tour of New York city and it was kind of

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:08.000
fun. Very cool. Yeah. It's,

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:11.000
it's going to be interesting to see how the league continues to grow next year.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:15.000
I've heard they already, uh, have two expansions confirmed.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:18.000
One of them is going to be Atlanta. Uh, the other one is the city in China,

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.000
which I do not recall the pronunciation of off the top of my heads. I apologize,

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:24.000
but it's another, uh, team out of China, uh, and Atlanta.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:27.000
Although I don't know if they are, I mean,

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:31.000
I one place I've been a little bit critical of Overwatch league is in granted

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
this is probably just a first year thing,

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:36.000
but the fact that these guys, these teams don't live in the cities they

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:41.000
represent, they're all in LA playing at the Blizzard LA arena. Um,

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:45.000
yeah. Um, there's something about that that I, that I know. So yeah,

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:48.000
that's, we'll just leave it at that. Well, I, well for what it's worth, I,

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:51.000
it's, it's public and out there that that is not the longterm goal,

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:55.000
that they are looking at building more arenas and that the longterm goal is it

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:56.000
would be more like football or whatever,

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:59.000
where these teams would be in their cities like that is something that

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Blizzard's gone on record saying. So if they're making moves to do that,

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:05.000
I wouldn't be surprised. I'm, I'm actually happy to hear it.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
Well, that's good. I'm all for that.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:10.000
I'd like to see more teams and you know, if you remember,

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:14.000
I was very critical of like esports and so forth.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:17.000
I'm starting to warm up to it.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:23.000
Maybe if they had really gotten more into televising gaming events like

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:27.000
this, like five, 10 years earlier, I'd be all for it.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Cause I'm sitting here thinking, you know,

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:33.000
I can't see myself watching somebody play street fighter five, you know,

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:37.000
whereas I will flip the channel and sit there and watch my favorite sports

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:40.000
team win a game or something like that, you know?

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
And, and my big thing is,

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:46.000
and still continues to be is that I hope the expansion of the league will

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:49.000
lead to more diversity because this is how I said,

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:52.000
this is why I would like the Overwatch league to be successful.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:55.000
I'm not out here shouting, shut them down or anything.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:58.000
But the great thing about expansion is that you don't have to let anyone

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:01.000
that's already there go. So these, you know,

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:06.000
these white dudes that are all makeup and, and, you know,

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:11.000
a lot of folks from Asia as well that play on these teams,

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
none of these folks have to go anywhere,

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
but maybe we could get some more women.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:18.000
I know there are more women that play Overwatch than one, you know?

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:24.000
So maybe we can get some more diversity with the ethnicities and nobody who's

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:27.000
currently there has to go. That's the great thing about expansions.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Again, there's something that I,

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:34.000
that I was told that I have to tell you off air.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
You'll have to tell me off air. Will it make me happy or sad?

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:40.000
I don't know. I know you pretty well, Rob,

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:43.000
but I can't predict how you would take this type of news.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:46.000
All right. Now you got me curious now, but all right, fair enough.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Fair enough. I respect the privacy of whatever it is you got going.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:53.000
So, all right. Well, my friend, any other thoughts?

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:57.000
Uh, no, that's it. I am basically getting ready for Otacon this weekend.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:00.000
So, uh, my liver is on full standby.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:03.000
Have a great time. That'll be me in a few weeks getting ready for DragonCon.

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:09.000
And then after that, we have to have a VoG reunion part due at MagFest.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Oh, I hope so. I would love to go to MagFest again.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
You know, MagWest is this coming weekend.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Yeah, I know.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Yeah. So, uh, we'll see. I, I may make a cameo.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Uh, one of my buddies is really trying to get me to go and I'm gonna,

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:24.000
I have plans to go to San Jose for something non-related anyway.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:27.000
So I may drop in for a little bit. So we'll see.

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Go for it, man.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:31.000
Yeah, I just might. All right, my friend, I'm gonna let you go though.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:32.000
All right, you too. Take care, brother.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:33.000
Take care. Bye.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:36.000
All right. Uh, let's see. I saw a couple other calls coming in.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
So let me see if we can get another one of those.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:42.000
At Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype before we wrap up here for the night.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Uh, and move on. So let's get to another call.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Hey, what's up? It's Kaijuto.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
Hey, Kaijuto. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
So much. You can hear me, right?

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Yep. You are great.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Hi, you were talking earlier about, um, No Man's Sky.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Yeah.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:03.000
And how you can, um, you know, you had fun playing with Bobby Blackwolf and, uh, who was the other person? Dungeon Buster?

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Yep. Dungeon Buster. My buddy Neil pops in now and then too.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:13.000
Yeah. So you said you guys are having fun, but you don't know, like, the longevity of that because you really weren't doing anything together.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:20.000
And I just wanted to remind you that there is voice chat. I think with voice chat, that opens the door to so much fun because then you can communicate.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:25.000
You're exploring together. You know, somebody might find something. They call you over to check it out.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:28.000
You know, you just take a long, kind of like stand by me in space.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:35.000
I guess. Like, you know, and maybe things that have happened to me, like when the biological horrors showed up and I started screaming on my stream.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Like if Bobby, if Bobby had been there too, when I did that, uh, then at least there would have been two of us to take them on.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:49.000
And maybe that's the trick to doing that stuff a little easier is to bring some friends along to zap those aliens down since you kind of know what you're in for.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Um, so maybe, you know, maybe there is some stuff. I just kind of feel like,

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:59.000
Not just zap, but I just mean that communication aspect.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Yeah, for sure. And since we've been streaming, when we play online together, we do talk and you know that again, it was fun.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:10.000
And I'm not saying like, you know, it's just when you kind of start to play the game on your own, you're really kind of exploring the story.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:16.000
You find that a lot of it is about how much have you explored? How many words have you learned?

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:28.000
How many things, you know, and it does seem like you're still kind of in a solo, a story, which if I, if the spoilers from the first iteration of the game still hold true about what the whole thing kind of ends up being at the end,

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:42.000
I could see how it's kind of like a solo experience, but I mean, there's nothing wrong with like kind of sharing with that with other people, but I'm just like, I don't see myself playing through this with somebody by my side for the entirety 60 hours or whatever it takes to get through the story. You know what I mean?

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:55.000
I get you. But like, the way I see it is like, you know, I go back to when I was a kid and, you know, I used to get games like Monopoly and Clue and now, no, what the fuck did you not understand the rules, couldn't comprehend the rules.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:23:01.000
I'm like six or seven trying to do like D&D and I'm just like, fuck it. And me and my friends just made up our own game.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:09.000
And I think that sometimes with some games, you don't need to just play the solo mode. Just like I said, like explore, communicate with each other, just kind of make your own game.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Yeah, that's a fair perspective. I bet people are making, you know, No Man's Sky is a sandbox of sorts and I bet people are making their own games out of it.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:22.000
You know, I think, aren't they supposed to have like racing and stuff that comes to the game eventually? I don't know.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:23.000
I thought that they mentioned that.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:29.000
I tuned into a random stream and some dude was driving a car. So I know that's a thing that I just haven't unveiled yet.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Yeah, they have vehicles.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:34.000
I didn't even know that was a thing until I watched some random Twitch. So there's more.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Yeah, there's more yet. Okay, Dungeon Busters confirms there's a racing track module.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:49.000
So that would be fun. So I think there's just, there's still more to discover. But yeah, I think it's, it's probably the sandbox versus the story of the game.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:57.000
I don't think the story of the game is really going to be that great with the multiple people, but the sandbox element, absolutely. The racing track stuff will be fun.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:05.000
Yeah, and as far as you know, there aren't any space battleships. I mean, I know that you fight in space for like, teaming up with each other.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:12.000
I don't know how that works yet. I know you fight space pirates, but I don't know if you can team up with others to fight the space pirates.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Yeah, I remember it was that thing we asked. But yeah, that's, that's what I want to go out and just want to remind you that, you know, you can communicate and I have all types of fun.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Because I mean, I play a lot of games online, and people are so fucking quiet in space, it's just like, no one talks no more.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:27.000
No, I see.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Unless they're like, some kind of party chat maybe, but I mean, it's very rare.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:36.000
No, I mean, I appreciate the other perspective. You're right, sometimes the game is kind of what you make it, in a way.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:43.000
And that's, especially with a sandbox game like Minecraft, like No Man's Sky, like, you know, a lot of games are out there right now.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:46.000
It is what you make it, so.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
All right, my friend, take care.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Yeah, anytime. Take care, buddy. Bye.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:57.000
All right, that is going to wrap us up for tonight, because I have some plans after the show.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:02.000
So sorry to those that didn't get through, but you can always email us. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
Because, you know, we're not getting emails.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
Or you can always tweet us at OLR.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:10.000
That's a Twitter name I will not be changing, and I'm going to hold on to that three-letter Twitter name with dear life.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:14.000
I may have given up a four-letter Twitter name, but I'm not giving up a three-letter one.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Anyway, that's going to do it for another episode of the show.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:19.000
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening tonight.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:23.000
As I always say at the end of every show, if you enjoyed what you heard here tonight, please tell a friend or two about the show.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Help us spread a word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:30.000
But if the voices aren't here to air, well, what are we supposed to do?

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:33.000
I hope those of you that went to EVO had a good time.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:40.000
I hope everybody that's been sitting at home gaming, whether it's No Man's Sky or building your own games or whatever,

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
I hope you've been having a good time as well.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:45.000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:49.000
Oh, I forgot to mention the five-star reviews wherever you pick this show up.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:52.000
iTunes, Google Play, those go a long way.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:56.000
Although I guess somebody was telling me you can't actually rate things on Google Play. I thought you could.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:01.000
And somebody had asked about Stitcher, so I haven't mentioned this in a while.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:11.000
I did ask OLR to be removed from Stitcher some time ago, because their podcast refreshing feed was not staying current.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:17.000
The show was months out of date, and nothing was changing, and they were doing nothing about it.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
So when I got emails from Stitcher people that were like,

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Why aren't you putting on any episodes? I said Stitcher is not representing our show the way it should be represented, and so I had it pulled.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
So that's why we're not on Stitcher.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:33.000
So I can recommend every podcast player out there except one.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Sorry, I know that one's pretty popular, but I'm sticking to it.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:44.000
You've got to accurately reflect. If your niche is going to be delivering podcasts, you need to deliver podcasts.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Anyhow, not to dwell in a negative space, but you guys deserve to know the truth.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
I'm not going to sugarcoat it. That's what it is.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:54.000
All right, let's get final thoughts. Loki, your final thoughts.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:27:00.000
I'm going to have to start a new game now that I finished the one I was working on.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:01.000
All right.

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:07.000
I don't know. It'll probably be along the same lines, just not the way they did it.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:10.000
I was going to say, you should make the one you did better.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:15.000
I can, but I can only do so much with that. I already have an idea.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:23.000
I don't want to do my grand, grand, grand idea that I had that was along the same lines, but maybe something smaller.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:24.000
So we'll see.

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:30.000
Well, at least I can tell Bobby, I have seen a game that Loki has done.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:36.000
It's very basic, but it's there. You did it.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:41.000
We did it this time with the car as well, but that never got released.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:45.000
Well, yeah, but you didn't, you didn't, and you still had unfinished stuff.

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:46.000
I always start that over and then...

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:49.000
There you go. There you go. All right.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:53.000
Anyway, uh, let's see. That is, uh, that's going to do it for tonight's OLR.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:59.000
My final thought tonight is, um, I need to, I need to spin some pokestops today. It's getting late.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:02.000
All right, that's going to do it. Thank you guys so much for listening to the show tonight.

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:06.000
I appreciate it as always. We'll be back in seven days to do it all again with episode 741.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Until then, happy gaming. Be nice to each other online and shake hands at the end of it. Bye.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:45.000
See you next week.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Bye.
