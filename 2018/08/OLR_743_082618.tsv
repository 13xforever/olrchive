0	17440	A quote that resurfaced after the Boston Marathon bombings explained why people ran
17440	19560	towards the danger rather than away.
19560	20640	Look for the helpers.
20640	24840	In the face of tragedy, camaraderie, sportsmanship, and care for your fellow persons is truly
24840	26200	the greatest of deeds.
26200	32560	Stay tuned for more.
32560	35920	Hello everybody and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
35920	37440	It's Orange Lounge Radio.
37440	41600	Tonight, episode 743 for this, August 26th of 2018.
41600	44360	I'm Rob Roberts and he is Techmaster Loki.
44360	45800	I'm also stuffed up.
45800	48880	Yeah, you're stuffed up and I have this voice.
48880	52560	I hosted Rocky Horror last night and my voice, you know, it's a lot of yelling and screaming.
52560	56800	I'm just shoving spicy salsa in my mouth constantly.
56800	57800	Take it easy.
57800	58800	Take it easy over there.
58800	60480	We got a long show for you guys tonight.
60480	65480	Not here tonight, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, she is still on leave due to a work conflict.
65480	71440	Join us live, participate with our show at live.vognetwork.com as we are live every Sunday
71440	75240	night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com
75240	78160	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
78160	81580	And yeah, I want to get into the big topic I think that's on everybody's minds right
81600	88100	now and this is supposed to be the show that's gonna sit on the feed for two weeks and when
88100	92980	I meet some new people at Dragon Con, this might be the first episode that they're hearing
92980	96820	and it's unfortunate because we've got this really kind of heavy topic to start things
96820	97820	off tonight.
97820	102500	So if you are brand new to Orange Launch Radio, maybe go listen to last week's show.
102500	106900	It's Loki getting angry at Nintendo's lack of online hits every week, but that's the
106900	107900	stuff you expect.
108780	114940	This week is just like anger in general and disappointment and just not understanding
114940	118940	a lot of stuff and obviously I'm referring to everything that happened in Jacksonville
118940	125620	today and I imagine most of you read the internet and use some type of social media with some
125620	130620	form of regularity, so I am sure you have all seen the news now, however, keeping in
130620	134420	mind that we have an international audience that maybe has not heard, let me just be straight
134940	140340	or at least what we know here on Sunday evening, going off of a CBS News article that I'm
140340	145700	looking at here, we had an incident today in Jacksonville, Florida, where there was
145700	151900	a shooter at a video game tournament that unfortunately has killed two other people
151900	157260	and then the shooter themselves killed themselves, so that would be three dead as of the time
157260	160900	that we're mentioning this and then of course multiple injuries, I'd heard 10, I'd heard
160900	163900	11, I've seen a bunch of numbers going around out there.
163900	169860	The game in question, Madden 19, was the tournament that was being held here in Jacksonville,
169860	175900	this was some type of pre-qualifier for a larger Madden, you'll have to excuse me, it's
175900	180820	no secret that I do not follow the sports games as much here on OLR.
180820	182620	They're Madden's challenge thing that we do here.
182620	186620	And not that that makes what's happening here any different because this could, you know,
186620	190100	we just talked about Evo a couple weeks ago on the show, fighting game tournaments, we
190100	195500	talk about tournaments for music games is something that we used to go to all the time
195500	199220	and they still have music game tournaments and Overwatch is certainly a big thing and
199220	200220	so on and so on.
200220	203180	I mean it kind of doesn't matter, the game, because I think a lot of us are kind of sitting
203180	209940	here going, you know, this could have been a tournament that I might have attended.
209940	215460	And so anyway, the shooter, who is apparently from Baltimore actually, and my understanding
215460	219620	is that he was a competitor in this event.
219620	223700	Now this is where things get fuzzy and rumors, I don't know how far down this rabbit hole
223700	229300	I want to go, but the chatter is that he is somebody who played the tournament earlier
229300	236180	in the day, lost, and this may have been what he did in response, which, you know, makes
236180	244900	us all go just like jaw dropping, like how can any person see that as a rational response
244900	248740	to any type of situation, let be alone a fucking video game.
248740	252100	Yeah, these are the people we need the arm.
252100	259260	Anyway, this tournament was being held at the GLHF Game Bar, it's part restaurant.
259260	262700	This seems like just kind of one of those, like the area that this is in looks like one
262700	267660	of those like downtown mall, hip spot, hangout type of places, it's out on the wharf.
267660	271260	We have places in old Sacramento like this, I'm sure it's just, you know, it's a gathering
271260	275420	spot, so this is probably a tourism thing to bring in all these people for this Madden
275420	280260	tournament that was going on, and now it's ended in this horrible tragedy, 150 people
280260	286720	overall involved in this event, and so on, and thanks to social media, you're getting
286720	290660	some of the players that are out there tweeting that are saying, you know, this is the worst
290660	294900	day, I'm never doing this again until they beef up security, and just, I think you're
294900	299260	just seeing a lot of people processing in real time, which is the upside and the downside
299260	303660	of social media and a lot of that instant gratification that we have in the year 2018,
303780	307860	which also, I suppose, would be related to the instant gratification of the fact that
307860	314860	yes, this was all being streamed on Twitch, now the good news is video was not captured
314860	319500	of the incident, which I, you know, in the case of law enforcement and trying to figure
319500	323420	out and answer some of those questions, that's probably not a good thing, but I would assume
323420	327520	there were security cameras at the place and they'll do what they need to do with that,
327520	331820	but I'm saying in the sense of the internet, I think it's a good thing that they, it just
331820	336740	happened that they were flipping to on Twitch, they went to like the kickoff, so like, you
336740	340780	know how it is, it's like a picture in picture for a minute, and then it went, the picture
340780	344900	in picture went away and it was mad and full screen when the incident happened, so we didn't
344900	352380	see the video, but unfortunately, the audio's there, and it's like, I, I'm not gonna lie,
352380	358420	I listened to it, against my better judgment, I listened to it, I wish I hadn't, so I'm
358420	363560	gonna say, you know, all those of you that are like curious as well, I would just take
363560	368820	my word for it, you don't need to hear it, and I'm not gonna spread that around any further,
368820	373460	if you wanna find it, you can find it, but again, I would encourage you not to do it,
373460	379260	because I think the people that do need to hear that, and do need to see that, are lawmakers
379260	384460	in this country, and look, I understand we got a lot of political opinions here at OLR,
384460	390080	we got a lot of political opinions when it comes to video games, that's fine, and I'm,
390080	397100	I'm really, really not trying to politicize an event, however, this is an event that is
397100	405980	occurring time, and time, and time, and time again, and every time, there's somebody that
405980	413060	always wants to say, it's too soon to talk about all this, now is not the time to politicize
413060	422620	when is the fucking time, time's up, bitch, time's up, because this is continuing to happen,
422620	428660	and what is so, like what makes me numb, what makes me sick, I'm sick, Loki, when I think
428660	433700	about this, I don't know about you, but like, like between the audio, between the thinking of
433700	438260	the fact that I'm about to go to this big convention where there's going to be thousands
438260	441920	of people, and look, I'm not, I'm not trying to knock that convention, it's gonna be a fucking
441960	445840	fantastic convention, I know they work with police, I know security's gonna be beeped up,
445840	451080	but I can't help but think about these things, because this is the society we live in today,
451080	460240	I'm sick, because nothing is going to be done about this, nothing has been done about this,
460240	469920	nothing, nothing, and they're not gonna do anything, I mean, they'll say it, they'll talk
469960	473880	a big game, but no one is ever gonna actually propose anything, or if they do propose something,
473880	479200	it's gonna get shot down by the other side. They shoot, I'm sorry, this, they shoot fucking kids,
479200	489000	kids get shot and nothing is happening, nothing about gun control, nothing about mental health,
489440	503600	somebody come up with a fucking idea and do it, please, because as if the other stuff wasn't that
503600	511400	enough, now this is on the front door of our community, and like, sure, I don't play Madden,
511400	516360	but this is still my community, and they're just gonna use this to push the blame on something
516360	519440	else, because it was a gamer that shot somebody, so it must be the game.
519440	524760	Don't get me started, don't get me started, and that's, that's ultimately, I think, like,
524760	530880	the role that we have to play in this, in some extent, is that we have got to push back when
530880	536640	that narrative comes up, that this is, oh well, it's a video game, no, it is not a video game,
536640	540880	there's so, you guys already know this, if you're downloading a video game podcast,
541320	548720	number one, the video game is a sports game, it's one of the most, if not the most popular sport in
548720	558360	America, as a video game, like, you can't blame, it's another way to do, like, this sport, is it
558360	565240	football's fault? Of course not, it's not the game's fault, so we have to push back on that
565240	570200	narrative, because guess what, you know, this, again, it's happening over and over and over
570200	579520	again, and it's not the game's fault. Now, here's something that, you know, I've kind of thought
579520	585200	about, as I've thought about a lot today, of this particular, you know, incident, and, you know,
585200	591880	what, what can we do from here, where can we go from here? Now, you have to go vote, well, that's
591960	598320	one, that's for fucking sure, like, these people that continue to do nothing need to go, they need
598320	606160	to go, and the only way they're gonna go is if you vote, that's it, like, vote, whatever your ideas
606160	613840	are, vote, but vote for somebody that has ideas, vote for somebody that's gonna do something, and
613840	619320	I think the other thing too is that, and something we have to take a long look at, and I'm not saying
619360	622760	I have the answer to this, I'm not saying you have the answer to this, I'm saying this is something
622760	628520	that, as a community, we have to look at, because there's, again, chatter, and I don't know, Loki,
628520	635840	but this certainly, I hate to say it, but it seems reasonable, well, no, it's not reasonable,
635840	643120	that's, that's a bad word choice, it seems, I hate to use this word, it seems plausible, that
643240	650560	the story about, that he lost a contest earlier in the day, and was so frustrated at the situation,
650560	656160	that he decided this was the way to take it out, I think we have to ask ourselves that question,
656160	663240	why did he come to that conclusion? Is that something in our culture? Is that something
663240	668880	in gaming culture? Is that something in American culture? Is that something in the way he was
668880	674680	raised? I don't know, I don't, I'm not saying I have the answers, but I think these are the
674680	679800	things that we have to take a good, long, hard look at over the next few days, and yes, we do
679800	684840	need to look at it, like, now, and not later, and try to figure out where we're gonna go from here,
684840	691040	because I'm sick of it, you guys, I'm sick of it, I was sick of it a long time ago, but like,
691040	697320	today, now, as, you know, gamers, and as people who talk about video games, it's landed on our
697320	702320	doorstep, and I think a lot of us, unfortunately, whether you want to admit it or not, we're kind
702320	707160	of wondering in the back of your minds, how long was it gonna be for this happen? How long was it
707160	711120	gonna be for this happen at a video game tournament? Because it's been happening in a lot
711120	720760	of places where people gather. Well, that question got answered. Anyway, I do want to go to, I want
720760	725800	to go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, because again, we do tape live Sunday nights,
726440	733720	at the VoiceGeeks Network, vognetwork.com, MXC in chat says, I feel you, Rob, you know, many of us
733720	738600	feel this way, thank you. I do know, it's frustrating, like, there comes this point where
738600	742360	you just start to feel helpless, and I think that's a lot of where my emotion comes from right now,
742360	748800	is like, just this like, helpless feeling, that like, we're being held, our entire political
748800	756880	system is being held captive by this stupid fucking game of heads versus tails, or whatever
756880	761640	you want to call it. You can't take our guns, they're gonna come for our guns. Well, here's,
761640	765000	you know, here's the reality of that situation. Second Amendment, yay. There's a part of me,
765000	768360	Loki, and again, I gotta watch how far down this rabbit hole I go, because I realize there's a lot
768360	771920	of opinions, but here's, here's, here's, here's where my head's at with that. Like, the more and
771920	775140	more that discussion happens, the more and more I kind of want to come to your house and take your
775140	782340	guns. However, however, big however here, I realize that's not possible. Loki, we live in a
782340	786900	world where now, like, you know, technology is a great thing, it's a wonderful thing, but it can
786900	791700	also be a dangerous thing, because now you can 3D print a gun. Remember? Remember that whole ordeal
791700	797940	from a couple weeks ago? They came out with the plans to be able to 3D print a gun, and I think
797940	802180	what happened, what happened to the court system? I apologize, I don't have all my ups and ups on
802180	806500	this, but I believe the court system said, take it off the internet. Basically, you can't have the,
806500	811180	well, of course, what happened, guys? Once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet. So,
811180	818380	if somebody wants to print a gun, they can do it. So, personally, I don't think the answer is taking
818380	826540	guns, because you're just not gonna do it. Now, assault rifles and these, you know, super guns,
826540	830740	these bigger guns, I mean, certainly, I think a question should be asked, who really fucking
830740	836380	needs those? But the reality of the situation is, you know, 20, 25 years, people will probably be
836380	841700	able to print those too. So, I think we need to start to look at a longer term situation than
841700	850780	that. And maybe the question of, why do we have a gun orgy in this country? Why are guns so fucking
850780	855260	glamorous? Why do we want to paint guns? Or sorry, paint guns. Well, I guess you can paint them too.
855460	862900	Why do we want to print guns? Is it, is it really for self-defense? Is it really that? Is there
862900	869220	something else going on there? We're not supposed to. Anyway. Because they told us not to download
869220	876900	cars, and now we're going to download cars. Let's see. SSG100Matt in chat says, I hate guns. I would
876900	882020	never own one. I understand some people's want for one, but I feel that given the way that society is
882020	885220	right now, we have to find a way to control who's getting these guns, not take them away,
885220	891300	control who and how someone gets them. I, I like, there is definitely that part of me that I guess,
891300	896300	yes, liberal tilting side of me that kind of like wants to jump right there with you. But I also
896300	901580	kind of like see this, like, I feel like as technology is getting better 20, 25 down years
901580	905580	down the road, like you, you're not going to be able to stop it. People can make their own guns.
905580	912580	So we have to answer some tougher questions. Why don't you just heavily regulate it now,
912580	917740	and then if it's too much, then you can always back off on it. You know, rules can, they can
917740	922620	change the laws, you know? So if it's not working out one way, they can, they can change laws,
922620	926460	change the law again, but, but they're worried that, oh, they're going to come and steal my
926460	934180	guns. Well, why do you have five AK-47s? You know, why do you have all these assault rifles?
934180	940860	Anyway, I, I'm sure we could talk about this topic alone for the next three hours. That's
940860	947340	not what we're here to do at Orange Launch Radio. Because really, I, I, I, I even kind of question,
947340	949780	like, do I even want to talk about it on the show tonight? But it's like, you have to,
949780	953980	because this is now, it's landed on our doorstep. It's, it's, it's in the gaming community now.
953980	960060	Like, even though this, this story we're talking about really has nothing to do with games,
960060	969420	it kind of does now. And I did ask a question there. Is there something maybe about that
969420	974860	tournament competitive culture? Is there something we could do? I don't know. Maybe the answer is not
974860	978340	really. It's just, there's idiots everywhere, unfortunately. And you're just going to intersect
978340	982580	with them at some point. Just like the people that swatted each other were a $2 bet and they
982580	989100	got someone killed because the cops went to the wrong house, which there's so many bad things that
989140	995180	went on with that scenario. But like, it's, it's just, this is a thing because people think they
995180	1001620	can get away with it. Yeah. Because they're, they feel empowered by having something like this and
1001620	1008140	they're like, I'm going to show them. And they just don't think there's no rational thinking
1008140	1015940	there. It's just, it's just, I look at me, you know? No, I agree. I don't know the answer,
1015980	1022940	but I'm sick and tired of nothing happening. So I hope to God something happens soon,
1022940	1029740	like tomorrow. But unfortunately I'm also accepting the reality. It won't. It won't.
1029740	1037100	But I will express my opinion with my vote come November. And I hope many of you who are just as
1037100	1045860	irritated as I am today will do the same. Anyway, video games are something that we use to sometimes
1045860	1052620	escape our problems. Video games are something that we use to try to better our mood when we've
1052620	1057340	had a bad day. Sometimes a video game is something I can come to, to make things better. Sometimes I
1057340	1061580	can get into a story and escape some of these things, take myself out of it for a little bit.
1061580	1066460	Sometimes I can hang out with friends in a virtual world, slaying orcs or humans, whatever side I
1066460	1071580	choose. That's the wonderful thing about video games. So we're going to get back to what we do
1071580	1076140	best and talk a little bit about video games. But, um, thank you for giving me the opportunity to
1076140	1081140	vent. I think we all need a little bit, a bit of it today, but in the meantime, Loki, let's talk
1081140	1087220	about what's going on in the video game world. Um, otherwise as the world keeps turning. Um, so our
1087220	1092420	kickoff topic tonight has a little bit to do with Microsoft and something they've got, uh, planned.
1092420	1096420	I don't know. Where is this? Loki is this rumor status is something we know they're doing. Where
1096420	1100140	is this? Something we've talked about before though. Like they would mention, we're thinking
1100140	1106460	about doing this back in the whole Xbox three 60 days where they were going to go with the whole
1106460	1110280	subscription model. I don't know if it was with GameStop was thinking about doing it, but it's
1110280	1115300	been thrown around before where basically you would have monthly payments like, you know, cause
1115300	1120740	when you go buy, you know, a phone or something like that with your wireless carrier, you pay it
1120740	1126020	off either in monthly payments or you drop the money upfront and usually you get a little bit of
1126020	1133540	a discount if you go through their service. So this is basically this all access, um, program,
1133540	1138820	which is basically going to allow you to make monthly payments. Um, the rumor is that you would
1138820	1148660	be able to get an Xbox one S, um, along with game pass and, um, Xbox live for $22 per month for two
1148660	1155220	years. So that'd be your contract, um, portion. And then if you want an Xbox one X, it'd be $35 a
1155220	1160220	month for two years and you get all those, the Xbox live and the game pass with that.
1160220	1166780	And it ends up being cheaper than buying all those separately, which is kind of nice. I don't know.
1166780	1170540	I think it's a great idea. I would totally get on board. It's like, it's like the subsidized cell
1170540	1174380	phone plan is now hit video games. Although you're right. I don't think it's the first time this has
1174380	1178740	hit video games. I do remember something about like the Xbox 360, like a whole, like, like,
1179740	1187100	great idea. I think it's an awesome thing. 35 bucks a month. I mean, it, it's not a lot for,
1187100	1191420	you know, your normal consumer nowadays who have cell phone plans. Like I remember when I first had
1191420	1196380	my non smartphone cell phone plan and that was like 50 bucks a month or something. I was like,
1196380	1200780	Holy shit, this is expensive. I can't imagine someone having to pay for a phone and stuff.
1200780	1204700	You know, now I have a smartphone and you know, I pay like almost 80 bucks a month for,
1204740	1211300	you know, paying off the phone and paying for my monthly plan. So it's not a huge deal. It's better
1211300	1216180	than dropping $600 and then you have to drop money for, you know, Xbox live. Cause you're probably
1216180	1220580	going to want it anyways. And then the games pass, you can either do with or without, but it's still
1220580	1227060	a good offer. You know, I think it's a great idea. I'd be curious to see them try it as I think it
1227060	1231620	would be very successful. Do you think that this might be kind of where this industry is going?
1231660	1234540	It's part of the reason I wanted to talk about this at the top of the show tonight. It's more
1234540	1240380	of like a kickoff topic to kind of talk about like, is this maybe where gaming's future as
1240380	1245820	far as like financial models is headed? Because we know like, look at television, like, you know,
1245820	1252060	television and cable, especially like it's, it's maybe not there yet where it's like faded,
1252060	1256380	but I would say, you know, you've got more and more people cutting the cord, fading. A lot of
1256380	1261420	those cable channels are kind of fading away as more and more people adopt Netflix, who
1262260	1267620	CBS, CBS on demand and all this other stuff where, you know, now the problem becomes is that you're
1267620	1271780	paying 10 over here, 10 over here, 10 over here, it starts to add up almost to more cable, but at
1271780	1275220	least you, you have a little bit more like the picking and choosing of what you're doing there.
1275220	1282020	So my point is television is kind of going that direction. Meaning movies is also going a similar
1282020	1287380	direction. I think less and less people are probably buying Blu-rays in favor of being
1287380	1291700	able to stream movies. Not everybody though. I think with Blu-rays a little different because
1291700	1296220	you have a lot of movie collectors, you have a lot of movie fans, people that do kind of want to
1296220	1300420	own it. You know, I think it's a little bit different, but I think you probably have less
1300420	1305900	people getting into that and more getting into the streaming. For me, I, they don't do deep
1305900	1310420	enough discounts on the movies themselves, whereas they do that with the game. So I don't get a lot
1310420	1315060	of stuff on impulse. Whereas I kind of wish it was that way where they would drop stuff down dirt
1315100	1318780	cheap and be like, Oh, Hey, I want to build up my library of this stuff. But I don't ever see that.
1318780	1323620	Like I now even check sometimes when they'll do those like games and movie sales on like the
1323620	1326860	PlayStation store. And I just look at the games. I'm like, Oh yeah, there's a lot of stuff I'd want
1326860	1331860	to pick up. Cause it's like five bucks. And I look at the movies and like, it was like $15 for an HD
1331860	1340060	movie. No, no, I'm not going to do that. Um, so I, anyway, with the Blu-rays, the TV, you know,
1340060	1343420	that's all going kind of this direction where streaming is becoming more and more popular. I
1343420	1349180	mean, it kind of makes sense that potentially video games is going this way too. I mean, to some
1349180	1355220	extent, sure. We have PlayStation now we have the, what are they called? Xbox all access, but the
1355220	1360420	Xbox game pass, the game pass, whatever it's called. Uh, and then I also kind of think the
1360420	1365980	problem with Microsoft system is it's a little diluted. Now is kind of, I mean, that's it. These
1365980	1368980	services are kind of like, we kind of look at them and go, well, they're kind of lame because
1368980	1376340	everything is second game passes, all brand new releases and catalog too. But like, and I like
1376340	1380660	the fact that I can download that to my system and play it off my system. I have to stream it
1380660	1385900	because like, you know, if I want to play a game right on this, I can do that on my own separate
1385900	1391260	TV without taking a bandwidth. Whereas any of my wife's watching some streaming show, that's going
1391260	1397180	to fuck up there. Forget, you know, there's stupid, uh, PlayStation now. It's not going to
1397180	1404220	work. Right. And to be fair also with like PlayStation now and the Xbox, uh, game pass, a lot
1404220	1408060	of the reason why I kind of write both of those off too, is that for me, a lot of the stuff on there
1408060	1412740	feels kind of very secondhand because it's all stuff that's kind of old, like it's older stuff
1412860	1417180	coming back to be playable on the systems, which, you know, if you're not playing all the latest
1417180	1421380	and greatest games, if you're somebody who's more of a casual gamer, who's getting into PlayStation
1421380	1425180	four, PlayStation three, a little later, whatever, I'm sure those things have a lot more value.
1425180	1429220	Those things might be really great options, but then of course you bring up their point to that
1429340	1433580	you have to kind of constantly stream with those where they, that may not be what you want to do.
1433580	1438460	You might want to have more of the, um, download it all at once and be able to play on demand like
1438460	1442860	game pass. Let you do. Yeah, I would be like, God damn it. I can't get the Xbox stuff straight.
1443020	1447220	Game passes the street station. No game pass is the one where you can download stuff. Okay. What's
1447220	1452300	the other one called PlayStation now? No, what's, what's Microsoft's all access. Well, all access
1452300	1457100	passes is going to be the one that you get the system. Oh God. All right. Games pass is the one
1457100	1463580	is basically their Netflix thing. All right. And then Xbox live is Xbox live, but no, seriously.
1463580	1471660	Um, I think it's a great idea. I, I'd be curious to see how they implement it. Um, yeah. Cause I
1471660	1477660	mean, it's just, I, I don't know. It just sounds like such a great deal. Um, I mean, especially if
1477660	1480380	you think about it, like say you're buying this, like you don't have an expert, I don't have an
1480380	1487020	Xbox. So basically I'm getting an Xbox one X and live, which I pay for anyways, because I need live
1487020	1491660	if I want to play online. And then I get this instant access to this huge library of games.
1491660	1496860	I mean, that's a fucking $35 a month. I think it's seriously, they come out with that. That's going
1496860	1502380	to be so big. Okay. And maybe this is the answer. I think it's going to be a hardware problem
1502380	1505420	because they're not going to have enough hardware to go around with something like that. Well,
1505420	1509020	it might, might be some of these limited in quantity or something like they only can sell
1509020	1512700	as many as they have the hardware for, but that will be Microsoft's thing to figure out.
1512700	1517180	But in, in regards to, you know, we've been, we've been talking for a couple of years now,
1517180	1520780	ever since PlayStations really kind of run out in the lead here with PlayStation four,
1520780	1525660	that Microsoft's going to have to kind of do something big. And my fan wank as to what big
1525660	1529100	thing are they going to do is that I always said, Oh, they're going to get rid of Xbox live and let
1529100	1533900	you play online for free. But maybe, maybe no, maybe it's this, this is like their, this is their
1533900	1538140	big maneuver. Microsoft's going to do this. And this is something that, you know, PlayStation
1538140	1542780	doesn't really have a model for nor one, I guess that they could really copy easy. I mean, I guess
1542780	1545980	they could do something with PlayStation now, but again, it's not the same cause you're not really
1545980	1551100	downloading those games. They really need to come back with a brand new service. It's just, just,
1551100	1556460	just fucking copy the Xbox service that they have, you know, enable backwards compatibility for
1556460	1560780	PlayStation three games or whatever you can do. I know that shit can fucking run PlayStation one
1560780	1566380	games. Okay. The fucking PS3 can run PlayStation one games. So there's no excuses there. Um,
1566380	1571340	they could come back with something new, have a classic library of free games that you can play
1571340	1575980	around with, but they got to have something PlayStation. Now they've been trying to push
1575980	1581020	that for years now. And it's just, I don't think it's taken off. I don't know anybody. It's like,
1581020	1587020	Oh yeah, PlayStation now going to chat at live.vog network.com. Bobby black Wolf says, uh,
1587020	1593340	fours of seven is 97 gigs on Xbox one X that's one 10th of my data cap. What about those data
1593340	1597340	caps? Is that kind of screw this thing up or what do you, what, what kind of interesting
1597340	1601100	monkey wrench does that put in it? I'm surprised that those games are so big. Like I'm not,
1601100	1606220	if it's four K true, that's, that's the problem. That's the problem.
1607980	1612060	I'm fine with that. Cause again, like that you're fine with what I'm not
1613100	1617900	your data cap getting eaten up. Yeah. I mean, you have to be a little more picky. You don't
1617900	1622620	have to download those games to play them. It is an option to download and play them offline.
1622620	1630940	You can stream them as well, but I bet you can't stream it in four K probably my fancy TV. I want
1630940	1634780	to play my fancy games, but I guess, yeah, I guess there is some decisions to be made. They're
1634780	1641660	interesting. So, um, uh, yeah. Bobby black old says, yeah, notice I said Xbox one X it's only
1641660	1648060	60 gigs on the original Xbox one. So that's why it's so big as all the four K. Yeah.
1648940	1653500	Well, you know, here's the thing though is like with that you can decide that, well,
1654140	1657260	you're still gonna have to download the patch, even if you buy the disc version of the game,
1657260	1663020	I guess. So that is a problem. Um, now, uh, the other thing I want to bring up here is
1663020	1667100	it's really not just Sony and Microsoft in this whole subscription thing. I mean,
1667100	1671900	we kind of don't know the definitive answers to this yet. And you know, I hate to be a broken
1671900	1677020	record here on OLR, but we know Nintendo is doing something with the classic NES games and it
1677020	1683900	appears that it's also going to be a subscription style model where this time the subscription
1683900	1691420	services Nintendo's online service comes with the classic NES games, which thankfully a 98 gig
1691420	1696940	download will not be the case with the class. At least I hope not with the classic NES,
1696940	1704060	unless the code is really badly optimized. It's it's so late though. I mean, it's,
1704060	1710860	is it though, considering that Sony's system is not, does not have a download it and play? I mean,
1710860	1715580	sure with the, with Nintendo switch, it's all going to be, it's all going to be classic games
1715580	1722940	or is it, you know, again, we're still expecting Nintendo to do this big unveil of Nintendo online
1722940	1726940	where I'm starting to worry more and more that now now social media drip feed is all we're going to
1726940	1734460	get, but maybe Nintendo might, might do something like this too. Take those expectations and bring
1734460	1740540	them way down. I'm telling you it's, it's not going to be anything. They're not expectations.
1740540	1744540	That's the beautiful thing. Loki is I've learned with the Nintendo to expect nothing when it comes
1744540	1753420	to online. And now I get pleasantly surprised. It's just, it's, I am expecting so little with
1753420	1757100	that. And especially for the price, I wouldn't expect anything more than just any S games,
1757100	1762220	maybe, Ooh, maybe asking me games. Honestly, they should just say, fuck it with their whole system.
1762220	1766380	Anyways, they can do like the, where he paid so much a month, you can get a library games, but
1766380	1769580	just put the fucking virtual console out there. I mean, come on, you're fucking making these games
1769580	1775100	anyways, just put it out there so we can purchase the games. Why you have to be fucking difficult
1775100	1780220	with it? Well, if I'm not mistaken, because the switch is on different hardware, maybe some of
1780220	1784700	the tricks they did before is not going to work again. I mean, here's the thing they might do.
1785500	1790860	Except that homebrew people can run those games just fucking fine. So apparently the hardware
1790860	1795340	can handle it. And I mean, it's, it's basically a Tegra chip anyways, which we know that shit can
1795340	1803340	run Wii games. Thank you to the Chinese, um, Nvidia shields. Um, so it can fucking handle
1803340	1808060	that. It's just, they're just being stupid about it. And here's the thing. Like I have no problem.
1808060	1814060	Like you don't have to support multiplayer in all the games. Cause guess what? You have
1814780	1819900	a marketplace that can patch games. So when you add it to, you can patch it in. There's also a lot
1819900	1823980	of games that just straight up don't need it. Like star tropics does not need two player mode.
1823980	1828700	Exactly. Just patch it in later. If that's really what you want to do. I don't see the big problem
1828700	1834060	with that. Like sell the game like, Hey, multiplayer coming out later on. Who cares?
1834140	1840140	It's a fucking NES game. Oh no. Multiplayer. I haven't played this game in like a billion
1840140	1845660	times already. I just don't see the problem. Why can't they can't put out more of these games,
1845660	1850060	especially their own games. Okay. I understand licensing and stuff with third party games and
1850060	1854860	that's, that's fine, but come on, you can fucking do better than that. Look, I mean,
1854860	1859580	I am excited at the potential of playing the multiplayer NES games online across a great
1859580	1863820	distance. Like I just know, and I don't know if Delvin's out there listening, but I just know
1864540	1868300	we're going to beat the shit out of each other in Super Mario Brothers three. Like that is the
1868300	1873660	thing that's going to happen across the wonderful internet. And we don't have to be in the same room
1873660	1878940	for me to click on his icon on the world map and then steal all his items or whatever it was you
1878940	1882620	do in that game. That was the thing you did, right? Didn't on the map, you would, you'd
1882620	1885660	click on the other player and then you wouldn't do it like a battle thing, right? Like it was
1885660	1892140	original. It was original Mario Brothers, right? So that's the thing that now gets to happen across
1892140	1897180	the internet. And then hopefully even better, maybe we'll stream it for everyone. For example,
1897180	1902540	like Sega ages has, um, games coming out on the switch and they've done enhancements for those,
1902540	1909100	like for example, fantasy star has a map feature that it draws a map for you because before it
1909100	1912460	used to be hard to navigate through the game because there's no map. So they had, they added
1912460	1916540	that in there as part of a new thing that they patched in. So there's things that they can do
1916540	1921900	that enhance these games, but they don't have to do it. They can just put them out there. Like,
1921900	1926620	did that, Oh, did the lack of multiplayer and stuff really stop, you know, selling those games
1926620	1933740	on the Wii or anything? No. Or on the Wii U? No. 3DS? No. Just put them out again. You'll sell them
1933740	1940220	again. No one cares. Uh, Dartusia in chat says, Oh yeah, I heard the fantasy star map feature is huge.
1940220	1943820	I never got to play the original personally, but I imagine that being a huge help. Oh yeah,
1943820	1949740	I'm sure. For sure. All right. Anyhow, uh, subscriptions. It'll be interesting to see
1949740	1953340	where that takes the industry in a few years. I wonder when we'll hear about that.
1954300	1957980	I'm not, I'm not talking about just Nintendo. It's like, what, how many like four weeks away?
1958860	1963740	We'll see. We'll see the day before Loki, we already answered this the day with the day before
1963740	1968700	they they're ready to do direct. Actually, I take that back because I think Nintendo announced a
1968780	1973180	Nindies direct, correct me if I'm wrong chat, but I think they gave us five days notice
1973180	1978540	on a Nindies direct that's early next week. So that'll be like all the, probably the rest of the
1978540	1983260	more indie releases for the year. But you know, sometimes Indies, um, has some, you know, big
1983260	1989900	surprises in there. So yeah, Nindies. So I forget when exactly that direct is, but I think it's
1989900	1993900	sometime next week and they gave us five days notice and I was like, wow, that's some big
1993900	1997660	advance notice. I know a hat in time's coming and that's going to be, that's going to be a
1997660	2005260	good game for the switch, I think. But, um, I don't know. I just, I under, I'm expecting to
2005260	2010940	be underwhelmed, whatever. That's fine because I expect it. And so I'm sure that it'll meet my
2010940	2017660	expectations. All right. Thank you. JD clarifies it is Tuesday at 9.00 AM Pacific. That is it.
2017660	2022060	So, uh, by black Wolf, uh, in chat says, I don't think they need to announce anything until the day
2022060	2027340	they launch continues to say nobody ever said, well, I would get online, but I'm mad that they
2027340	2030700	didn't tell me this four weeks ago. No, they do need to announce it because they're taking
2030700	2035420	pre-orders on the goddamn thing. So I think that we should know exactly what we're paying for.
2035420	2040460	I, I, yeah, I sorta get your point, Bobby, but at the same time, they are going to be asking us to
2040460	2043500	kind of like commit to this. And I think a lot of us kind of want to know, okay, what is it that
2043500	2050220	we're paying for? And if they want this to be big day one, if they want this to be like an event
2050220	2054300	thing, which I always kind of thought most things of video games really tried to get everything out
2054300	2059580	the door on day one. Hence why we have pre-orders of games and everything. Then I would think they'd
2059580	2064620	give at least like a little notice, but maybe they just feel that because they already know these
2064620	2068460	people are playing Splatoon two online. These people play Mario Kart online. They're going to
2068460	2072940	have to pay up to keep doing it online. So maybe Nintendo is just kind of banking on that. I don't
2072940	2077740	know. No. All right. Anyway, their online service better be good because you're gonna hear people
2077740	2083020	going, well, I'm paying for this shit and it fucking sucks. So just saying, prepare for that
2083020	2087260	Nintendo. All right, let's move on. Let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks and the types
2087260	2090460	of video games that we've been playing this week. Loki, how was your gaming week? I haven't played a
2090460	2094940	whole ton of console stuff. Um, well actually I haven't played any console stuff really. It was
2094940	2103340	mostly just, um, Pokemon go and I'm fucking pissed off at the app right now because it's just all
2103340	2110060	sorts of broken. They patched it recently and it just screwed everything up since then it's,
2110060	2116220	you know, lagged out like really bad. It's freezes. Every time I enter exit my either
2116220	2123020	like I changed from, you know, wifi connection to, you know, LTE or if it, you know, goes from
2123660	2128140	playing, it doesn't even play audio through my speakers because I have the audio turned off, but
2128140	2132620	going from being connected to my Bluetooth to not being connected to my Bluetooth,
2132940	2138700	it freezes the game completely for 30 seconds. It's fucking dumb. This, this never happened
2138700	2144060	before. And then like there's sometimes I'll go to lunch and I'll let it just, you know,
2144060	2148220	cause I'm driving through a parking lot, so I'll let it collect, you know, some kilometers that way
2148220	2152220	and it come back and the phone feels like that the battery is literally going to explode because it's
2152220	2159660	so fucking hot. I'm like, why the hell did there's nothing going on at this game? It's just like,
2159660	2163660	what the hell did you do? Like basic functionality doesn't work. Like I can't spin
2163660	2167340	pokey stuff. Sometimes I'll be sitting right there. I'll spin it. And it's like, try again
2167340	2172780	later or, you know, I have great data because I know cause I'm still being able to catch stuff
2172780	2177340	or I'll try to catch things. I had one where there's a Pokemon that spawned and disappeared
2177340	2183100	immediately. I was like, what the fuck was that? I have that problem sometimes on a iPhone. I think
2183100	2187580	it's like distance really. Cause what I noticed is that my, my character will slingshot like as
2187580	2192540	the GPS tries to correct itself to the correct location. And so now suddenly my phone thinks
2192540	2196460	I'm driving. So it shuts off the Pokemon for a few seconds before they come right back.
2197260	2203100	So I, it is, it is weird because they have it in order to do the animation, they have it chasing
2203100	2207820	the GPS coordinates. So your character is chasing it, but they calculate everything based on the
2207820	2212380	distance of your character, not where your fucking GPS is because that makes all goddamn sense.
2212380	2219260	Um, well, you know, I, I know they just updated it on iOS and a lot of people were having problems
2219260	2223340	like even getting the game launched when the update happened. So people just deleted the
2223340	2227820	app and reinstalled and now it works fine. So you might want to try that. I mean, you're on Android,
2227820	2232700	so I haven't heard of that, but I think in general, turning it off and then on again is
2232700	2237660	always good. I also had the issue too, where like it does this weird random, like rotates the camera
2237660	2243660	around to meet the Pokemon, which never happened before. Um, I don't know. It's just silly stuff
2243660	2250140	like that, but, so it's a little bit pissing me off. Um, but I'm still been playing each, oh,
2250140	2256620	and like, I mean, I know it's random, but like the other day I was trying to get gifts to send
2256620	2263340	the people. And I literally like, I threw away 50 Poke balls and I spun like a good 15 Poke stops.
2263340	2267500	Still have to throw away another 50 balls after that and no fucking gifts,
2268220	2272860	none. It's just like, where'd your balls go, Loki? It's like three. Like I'm like, I have all these
2272860	2277260	like common Poke balls and stuff. I'm like, I don't fucking need these. I can't catch anything
2277260	2284940	with these. Like nothing will go in these balls. I have the, I have the other balls that I could
2284940	2291980	use, but I'm, I'm, I'm refraining from saying blue balls. So we're not going to walk into that.
2291980	2298220	Uh, it's for the best, but you know, it's just, it's just bullshit. Like sometimes like,
2299420	2302860	I don't know why they make certain Pokemon like insanely hard to catch. Like,
2303420	2306860	like there's some of the rotatas that just keep like jumping. I'm like, I don't even fucking
2306860	2311740	want you. I just have to use up this inventory. So I have room for other shit and I'm just going
2311740	2316540	to cover experience or rotata. Nobody wants you, you know what fucking wants you or the like
2316540	2323020	stupid like torture or whatever the fucking like lantern flower thing. I'm like, I don't fucking
2323020	2330140	want you. Why are you so goddamn hard to catch? You're completely fucking useless. So basically
2330140	2335820	that and dance dance revolution extreme. I have been working more in, um, well still in unreal.
2335820	2340300	I've been working through some other tutorials, learn more about like the third person controller
2340300	2345980	and stuff like that. And just some of the things with, with that in, um, I don't know.
2345980	2351260	I'm just messing around, still trying to learn things. Um, it's pretty much it. Cause it's,
2351260	2355340	a lot of the lessons, unfortunately they have online tutorials are basically covering the
2355340	2360060	same stuff and it's hard to find new material that kind of covers things that haven't gone
2360060	2367260	through yet. So I'm just checking things out and experimenting. So that's pretty much it.
2368220	2374860	Okay. Uh, let's see my gaming week. Um, not a lot of like new stuff. I'm still just,
2374860	2378620	I'm, I feel like I'm in this lull before all these games start to come out. Like,
2378620	2382940	I think the first big game I'm looking forward to is in a couple of weeks. We have dragon quest 11
2382940	2386700	is out like the first week of September, probably when I get back from dragon con.
2386700	2391420	So, uh, that's exciting, but, uh, yeah, otherwise I'm continuing to just kind of play stuff on PC,
2391420	2395580	like final fantasy 14. So I've been making some progress in that just, uh, enjoying some of the
2395580	2401020	end game, uh, playing heroes of the storm. Um, who was the latest character I just bought? Oh,
2401020	2405420	I just bought the new one. They put out white main. I bought her, I saved up 15,000 gold,
2405420	2410460	which is a lot of, which a lot of AI matches. Keep in mind, I played like 98% AI matches.
2410460	2414860	So, uh, I finally saved up the gold to get white main and I've been playing with her a little bit
2414860	2419260	and yeah, she's kind of a different type of healer. Uh, and her attacks are really weird.
2419260	2422380	So that's been kind of fun to play. So even though I bought her though, I've been playing more and
2422380	2426220	more would just like experimenting with, with like other characters and trying to find stuff
2426220	2429740	that I like. I'm trying to think of what that character was that I was playing yesterday that
2429740	2434940	I'd barely ever played. And I found that I really liked playing them, not arbiter, but one of the
2434940	2438780	other star craft characters is like a tank that does a little charge move that goes back and
2438780	2442380	forth. I can't even think of the name now. Maybe somebody in chat knows, but that's, uh, that's the
2442380	2448620	character I like to play, uh, right now. Um, and chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Ryan says,
2448620	2453740	white main is super good at heals in the meta now. Oh, Artanis. That's it. Artanis is the one
2453740	2458940	I'm really enjoying playing right now. Uh, thank you, Ryan. Uh, and then they're asking Phoenix.
2458940	2463900	I said, Phoenix. Phoenix. I like Phoenix. Phoenix does the little circle laser thing. He goes,
2463900	2467420	like draws a little circle laser. That's kind of fun to play cause you can kind of control the
2467420	2471420	radius of that. So it's kind of like a different type of character, but yeah. Um, the, the one
2471420	2475260	I've been playing a lot of matches with lately is Artanis. And then, uh, I don't know why I've,
2475260	2478860	I've been like playing all these Starcraft characters. I've been playing Tassadar
2478860	2482460	is the other one. I got a really cool skin that looks like an Egyptian type of like
2482460	2488140	mummified thing for, um, Tassadar. And, uh, I really like he's supposedly it's,
2488140	2495020	he's supposedly a healer, but like he does like a shield. And if you get hit when the shield is
2495020	2499740	on you, then you get some health back. It's not the most effective heal in the world, but like,
2499740	2504700	he's really good at burning lanes. Cause you can do the whole little, um, um, thing on the ground
2504700	2508060	that does the thunderstorm and yeah, that's the way I kind of like to build. So he's a good,
2508060	2512780	like, I like the guys that can kind of lane on their own. That's why I really like Sylvanas.
2512780	2516860	I like Hanzo cause you can kind of like really burn down lanes on your own with those characters.
2516860	2521660	And those are, those are kind of fun to play. So anyway, uh, cool. I didn't realize we have
2521660	2524780	quite a few heroes, the storm players, cause some folks in chat are talking to the bonds.
2524780	2529820	Double six says I always lean towards the Starcraft players. Um, and, uh, Ryan also
2529820	2534860	clarifying that, uh, white main is super good at heals in the meta now. Yeah. I hear she's
2534860	2540860	pretty good at heals. Uh, bonds double six says white main is good to heal tank. Awesome. So,
2540860	2549740	um, let's see. And I've also been, uh, enjoying, um, Pokemon go. I'm still playing. Um, I don't
2549740	2553820	have quite the frustrations that Loki has been having. Of course I'm on iPhone. That's not to
2553820	2557900	say it's not perfect. I was having a day or two where I'm like, God, I've spun like a million
2557900	2562540	stops and I'm not getting any gifts, but I think it's just one of those. Some days you have good
2562540	2567100	luck. Some days you don't today. Um, Alan and I decided to go for a walk. So we went to the,
2567100	2570860	the chicken park closer to your, where your neck of the woods. We went over to the chicken park
2570860	2576220	and just walked around. I got a good 20 gifts to send out. Yeah. There's tons of stops over there.
2576220	2580620	Yeah. So we, we like to go, we'd like to go there. We'd like to go to Sac state, the university.
2580620	2585340	We'd like to go downtown, walk the Capitol park. Uh, it's just hard to park down there sometimes.
2585340	2588700	Uh, so those are like, but like community today, well, we always go to Capitol park
2588700	2591580	at some point. We'll probably go up to Palladio, even though that's a ways away from here,
2591580	2595580	but like, these are all the places around town. Like there's concentrated pokey stops and
2595580	2599100	yeah, you can just kind of, and I like to just play with the gotcha so I could just walk. I
2599100	2602940	could do, you know, my power walk in and my gotcha is just doing everything and spinning all the
2602940	2608140	stops. And then like maybe every lap I'll stop, send out gifts to friends and then keep going.
2608700	2614940	So yeah, but my friends list, uh, that, that quest, man, now I'm getting more people adding
2614940	2620620	me cause that quest that makes you add three people. So I haven't gotten that yet. There'll
2620620	2625100	be a quest in the celibate thing where you have to add three people. So you have to make three
2625100	2628860	new friends. So I'm sure that people out there willing to be like, you read the fine print,
2628860	2637260	you gotta refer three people to Ingress. What? Yeah. Right. Um, so, uh, I, uh, I have 108 people
2637260	2641660	on my friend. No, I have 110 people on my friends list, which is, I love having tons of friends,
2641660	2646140	but don't have Bobby as a friend. The problem is I said no audio. God damn it.
2646140	2651580	Maybe he doesn't want to be your friend. Okay. Anyway, well that wouldn't be surprising
2651580	2658220	anyway. No. Uh, but the thing is, is that that's, I can't spend that many gifts in a day. I cannot
2658220	2663900	get that many gifts. That's too many gifts. Right. And then you can only open 21 and, or no 20,
2663900	2668540	not even 20 when you don't open 20. So it's like, I have to kind of pick and choose and it really
2668540	2672780	sucks. Cause then it's like, Oh, I feel like this person probably thinks I hate them, but
2672780	2677100	no, it's just the person that I keep. If I keep going down the list, it's like the person I always
2677100	2682940	end up on. I think today it was Bobby's wife. Actually I went to open Bobby's wife's gift and
2682940	2686380	that was the one where I got the message that said, you've opened too many gifts today. And
2686380	2689340	I was like, Oh, she's going to think I don't like her. And I'm going to see her in three days.
2690620	2696780	How dare you open? So I'm like, I guess I'll have to do another lap around the park so I can send
2696780	2703900	one. So at least it's walking incentive. All right. Uh, I guess that's really it for my gaming
2703900	2709340	week. So, um, yeah, so I'm hoping, uh, by the time we're back live again in two weeks, uh,
2709340	2713340	I'll have some new stuff. Cause I think Dragon Quest 11 is out by then, uh, along with some
2713340	2718620	other stuff too. Uh, anyhow, let's get to housekeeping. So there will be no show next week
2718620	2724620	live, uh, or taped because I will be at Dragon Con in Atlanta. And if you don't know Dragon Con,
2724620	2729340	it's a, I've been going for years. So I've talked about it here on the show. Uh, it's a lot of fun.
2729340	2733660	It's like, imagine 24 different conventions all happening at once. That's basically,
2733660	2737340	and maybe give or take a few on the number. That's basically what Dragon Con is. You have all these
2737340	2742380	different tracks that take up different hotel ballrooms and different things. Um, and so if
2742380	2749180	you just want to spend the entire fucking Dragon Con in the space. Track where you, where they have
2749180	2754220	people from NASA that come in and talk and they talk about space. Like I would not fucking blame
2754220	2758780	you for that. And you would have an amazing time at the convention. But you know, if you're me
2758780	2764540	and you're like, I like podcasting and I like video games, then you kind of tend to go back
2764540	2769340	and forth and, and it's the costume track that does the really good dance party. I want to go
2769340	2773420	to, you kind of end up floating around different stuff. So you can kind of, it's, it's like getting
2773420	2778460	the sampler platter at Denny's, but with a convention, actually not Denny's because their
2778460	2784060	food is shit. It's like getting the sampler platter. What's a restaurant with a good sampler platter?
2784220	2790860	No, I don't know. What is it? All the, all the places that are coming to mind like closed. I'm
2790860	2794940	like the sample platter at Caro's. Wait, no. Uh, the sample platter at Epi's. No, wait, they're
2794940	2801500	gone too. God damn it. Okay. Yes. Bobby Black Wolf, a Brazilian steakhouse. I like that.
2803100	2807980	They bring by the panels on a big sword and they slice off. Would you like to go to this panel?
2807980	2813020	But anyway, besides just that, you could probably also have a very rewarding, great time not going
2813020	2818620	to any fucking panels. Uh, many people just like to kind of walk around the halls, check out the
2818620	2824700	cosplay, meet up with friends, drink a little bit. Um, if you don't want to head out and go watch the
2824700	2829900	parade and things like that, they have a closed circuit TV station that runs on all the host
2829900	2834380	hotels, have this special TV station called dragon con TV that broadcasts all this stuff.
2834380	2838220	So it's really cool. And you can actually get that online now so you can get to the dragon
2838300	2843500	con TV. Yeah, it's pretty cool. So, uh, well it's pay for it, but you know, well, the money goes
2843500	2847820	back to the convention to support and all that good stuff. You know, it ain't nothing for free
2847820	2852620	Loki. Anyway, uh, speaking of panels, I do hope you will check out some panels this year because,
2852620	2857100	um, I am going to be a part of eight different panels at dragon con this year. I want to tell
2857100	2861100	you really quickly, uh, where you can find me at dragon con. I do hope you will be there in Atlanta.
2861100	2867420	If you are in the area, come say hello at one of these panels. So Friday at 10 AM, uh, I will be
2867420	2873340	doing a panel called meet the cast mass effect. And I'm really excited about this as a panel with
2873340	2879580	DC Douglas, Mark Muir and Courtney Taylor, uh, all from the mass effect series, uh, the voice actors
2879580	2883340	and actresses. And we're going to talk a little bit about mass effect and like, you know, all
2883340	2888300	these years later, how there are going to still be tons and tons of people dressing up in mass effect
2888300	2894860	costumes and what that means and how they feel about all that. Um, and even, uh, my pod daddy,
2894860	2898780	uh, Travis Donovan is making his triumphant return to dragon con this year. And I'm sure
2898780	2902460	he's going to wear something in seven related too. So I'll, I'll have to be sure to ask about
2902460	2909660	my pod daddy. Uh, anyway, speaking of podcasting Friday at 7 PM, I'll be on a panel called
2909660	2915740	interaction in real time, the art of live podcasting. And the description actually says
2915740	2920300	Bobby Black Wolf and Rob Roberts of the voice geeks network have been doing their podcast live
2920300	2926220	since the early two thousands before it was easy. I don't know. The life she's five software wasn't
2926220	2930060	complicated, but you're right. It was very different back then. So, uh, we'll be talking
2930060	2936460	all about, you mean it did it without a Patreon. Well, shush the live pot. We'll see. The thing is
2936460	2943260	live podcasting is like back now. So like it was the only thing you did before then it was like,
2943260	2948380	well, it's not really a podcast. If you're doing it live, that's not really a podcast. That's just
2948380	2956140	a taped life. Stop anyway. But now we're back to live podcast because of things like Twitch
2956140	2960220	and YouTube and YouTube live and all this stuff that people are doing. So, uh, that is,
2960220	2964860	uh, something we'll talk about is, is the art of live podcasting. I will be a judge on a panel
2964860	2971020	called pod tank pitch your podcast. So yes, it's basically like shark tank, but for podcasts,
2971020	2975100	we will hear pitches and we will give feedback. And if you want to know if I'm going to be the
2975100	2979900	Paula Abdul or the Simon Cowell of the panel, you'll just have to attend. That's 10 o'clock
2979900	2985900	on Friday. Then Saturday. Now the listeners of OLR are going to understand why this is hilarious.
2986540	2992780	I'm going to be moderating a panel called Saturday at one o'clock. Let's play five nights
2992780	3001660	at Freddy's sister location. Why are you laughing? Loki? Cause you love horror games.
3002460	3007420	So if you don't already know when I play horror games on Twitch, as I've done here and there,
3008060	3013740	I scream and I scream loudly because jump scares scare the fucking hell out of me. Well,
3013740	3019500	five nights at Freddy's is a game about nothing but jump scares. So this is going to be something
3019500	3024620	anyway. Um, they actually asked if I wanted to play the game while I moderated and I politely
3024620	3030700	declined. Um, so I believe this speaker, um, and I'm, I hope I'm saying the name right. Panina.
3030700	3033980	I hope I'm saying that right. I'm so sorry if I'm saying that wrong, but, um, I will hopefully
3033980	3037580	meet this person soon. Uh, they, I believe are the ones that are going to be playing the game,
3037580	3043500	uh, while we have in the, in the panel, Kellen Goff, Heather masters and Julie shields,
3043500	3048620	because did you know that, um, this, uh, five nights at Freddy's sister location has way more
3048620	3052860	voice acting than the other games. So these are voice actors from this game. So we'll,
3052860	3056540	we'll kind of hear some stories about what all went into that while we do the panel,
3057420	3061740	uh, Saturday at two 30, uh, that'd be Saturday, September 1st at two 30
3061740	3066540	broadcasting in podcasting. We're going to talk a little bit about broadcasting best practices

3095740	3099820	I, I, I am honored that I'm being asked to do this when I'm not even a partner,
3099820	3105580	I'm just an affiliate, but I will be moderating this panel Twitch one Oh one, uh, with Caroline.
3105580	3111020	She is a engineer over at Twitch. And we're going to talk a little bit about what you need to do to
3111020	3114460	get started. And so talk a little bit about it's Twitch one Oh one y'all, we're gonna talk about
3114460	3119260	the basics of Twitch. So that'll be a fun panel. Uh, I'm not done yet. Sorry. This is boring,
3119260	3123900	but I'm really excited for all these panels. So I've got two more, uh, social media for
3123900	3129900	digital creators is Saturday at seven o'clock. And we'll be talking about Twitter, Tumblr,
3129900	3134620	coffee, Facebook, Instagram, all these social media outlets, all these places you can promote
3134620	3140060	your show. Yes. Loki, Patrion too. We'll talk about all these places and how to pick what's
3140060	3145260	right for you because for some people, Loki, Patrion may not be right for you,
3145260	3148300	but for other people, it may be right for them. It just depends on what they're trying to do.
3148940	3155260	And then lastly, here's the last panel I'm doing Sunday, two 30 PM in the Western peach tree,
3155260	3160460	sorry, the Western peach tree ballroom. Logan is a huge room. This is one of like the biggest rooms,
3161340	3167260	the Overwatch voice actor Q and a, I am so honored to be doing this one with, um,
3167260	3173740	Anjali Bhimani, the voice of Anna, if I remember right, Charlotte Chung, the voice of diva and
3173740	3180780	Lucy poll, the voice of mercy are all going to be on that panel with little old me, uh, Overwatch.
3180780	3185740	So we're going to talk about that. And just how Overwatch has gotten so big with e-sports. I'm
3185740	3190700	really curious. I want to know if they like watch the e-sports events and how it feels to kind of
3190700	3195340	be like a voice, like in those e-sports I kind of, I'm really curious on their take on like,
3195340	3198860	did they ever think when they were recording these lines that, Oh my gosh, it was going to
3198860	3203180	be like this huge, like sporting event that's filling arenas, the Barclay center and stuff.
3203180	3208940	So I'm really excited to see. And then of course I have to ask the voice of mercy. I have to ask
3208940	3214300	how it feels to have her character retooled every six months. I have to think of a taxable way to
3214300	3219980	ask that. So there you go. Anyway. Uh, anyway, if you're going to be at, uh, dragon con, please
3219980	3225660	check out one of those panels. If you're not going to be at dragon con, they may be doing some
3225660	3231180	streaming of the panels. Uh, the podcasting ones anyway, maybe streamed online. I promise I will
3231180	3234940	have up to the minute information on my Twitter. So if you're not following me on Twitter, you
3234940	3240460	should think about doing that twitter.com slash Mr. Rob Roberts or at Mr. Rob Roberts. That's MR
3240460	3244380	Rob Roberts is where you can find me over on Twitter and I'll give you all the latest and
3244380	3249340	greatest over there. So, and also, yes, thank you, Bobby, for letting, reminding me, we have
3249340	3253820	a special discord channel in the vog network discord for dragon con. That will be where we
3253820	3258700	will post video or maybe video, I don't know, photos for sure though. Uh, and all that stuff.
3258700	3265020	So especially as we have, uh, Bobby is going to turn our hotel room into the VR suite again,
3265020	3269820	where I'm sure we will be playing much beat saber and that will be, I'm sure, uh, pictured. And
3269820	3273900	those will go to our discord channels. If you're not on our discord yet, check it out.
3273900	3281260	vog network.com slash discord. Um, SSG, 100 mountain chat says somewhere grandpa from
3281260	3286860	hoard house is like Rob's ego is going to be bigger than insert rude, inappropriate comment.
3286860	3292140	Um, I am like, so I I'm so honored and humbled that I'm being asked to do these panels. I'm like,
3292140	3296380	I'm, I'm actually like, I'm kind of like, I'm a professional, but I'm kind of intimidated by
3296380	3299980	some of this. I'm like, Oh my God, I hope I don't ask the wrong questions or I hope I don't sound
3299980	3305020	like an idiot or ask the questions that have been asked 5,000 times. Yeah. Cause that's how
3305020	3311820	you end up in variety. I don't think I'm going to have that problem. That was a whole nother. That
3311820	3316060	was a whole nother personality who, if they asked me to do that panel, I might've had a different
3316060	3321500	answer, but you know, you live, you learn anyway. Um, all that. I wonder if he's going to be at
3321500	3327340	dragon con that the one time I met Billy Mitchell was at dragon con. So I wonder if, uh, he'll be
3327340	3332460	there. Bobby, do you know, do you know that? And Bobby also giving a nice Hardy fuck you Loki in
3332460	3337900	our chat room over at live.vognetware.com. All right. And yes, bonds, double six says,
3337900	3341500	that's what the room is for to ask the stupid questions. So you don't have to. And that's my
3341500	3344780	plan to just let you know what they want to ask the questions. I'm not going to take over those
3344780	3348860	panels. I'm gonna let them do it. Of course they might, they might ask that. I do feel like 20
3348860	3352060	minutes or something and you know, I'll be ready for whatever. I'm already going through questions
3352140	3356780	in my head. Uh, and if you're worried about somebody keeping my ego in check,
3356780	3362220	remember Travis Donovan is returning to, uh, dragon con this year. And if anybody is going
3362220	3366060	to sit there and go, listen, bitch, I made you and I can break you just as easily.
3366060	3376060	It will be Travis Donovan. So there you go. All right. Anyway, uh, Bobby says, uh, he was just
3376060	3380060	there as a guest of Southern fried game room expo last year, not as a guest. So I don't even think
3380060	3384540	he had panels last year. He was just there. So we'll see. Hopefully he'll be back this year. I
3384540	3388540	mean, you know, despite everything's been going on, actually, if he is there, I do kind of want
3388540	3392780	to be there. If like Bobby and him cross paths, I want to see if like, you know, they, they,
3393500	3398380	so how about that panel? You know, you want to be there too. All right. Anyway, we'll see.
3399660	3402860	All right. Moving on. Let's get into some video game news. Uh, Loki.
3403660	3408140	All right. So we can talk about things coming to the switch. So obviously with
3408140	3412780	their whole online service, we're expecting more apps to be actually included with it.
3412780	3417500	You know, aside from the obvious, you know, eventually Netflix and that stuff coming to
3417500	3423260	the service, there is one app that is, um, supposed to be coming. And that is an app called,
3423260	3433340	I believe inky pen. And so inky pen is a online, I guess, comics manga. And, um,
3433340	3438300	I don't know if it's other magazines as well. Service, basically you can read
3438940	3443500	those online. And so they have thousands of comics available at launch. It's supposed to
3443500	3448940	be coming out sometime in November. So that's kind of neat. I like that, you know, this
3449580	3454700	device will be used for some other media stuff. I wish that they would have, you know, a
3456300	3460460	web browser and stuff as well, but I know that there, remember when the 3ds was going to have
3460460	3466220	3d movies? It did very minimal, but no, that's right. They had like, didn't they have like
3466220	3470220	cartoons and stuff? I remember seeing them in E3, but did the movies ever actually come out? Yeah,
3470220	3475340	they did. Um, they were, they did digital version of like, there was a tech in CG movie that came
3475340	3481420	up and they did that. That's right. I only ever saw the fucking dinosaur shorts and all that crap
3481420	3485820	they had on the Nintendo. Yeah. I remember they were really pimping that. And then they just
3485820	3490700	decided that, fuck it. No one wants 3d, which is wrong. We do want 3d, but we also want a
3490700	3496380	powerful system that can run it. Um, so I hope they don't give up on 3d, but everybody else has,
3496380	3505180	I guess. Hmm. But, um, yeah, it'll be, it'll be neat to see more apps on the service. I'm
3505180	3510620	just curious to see if what else will be coming at some point. It just kind of gives us a timeframe.
3510620	3515180	It also lends more fire to that whole discussion about, you know, the Nintendo switch is basically
3515180	3521100	the successor to the PSP and the Vita. You've heard that one before. So they're gonna forget
3521100	3525500	about it at some point. No, I don't. I think I saw it and be like, what? I don't think Nintendo
3525500	3529980	will forget about it anytime soon. No, no, it's not going to suffer that same fate. We know that
3529980	3534460	anyway. Um, but what is interesting is that, you know, what's old is new again on the Nintendo
3534460	3539660	switch. It has been a bit of a port city, if you will. And, uh, that's not going anywhere anytime
3539660	3543820	soon, especially with this announcement this week, the deep silver is bringing saints row,
3543820	3549020	the third to the Nintendo switch. This was some news they made at games com saints row,
3549020	3555420	the third originally launched on PS three PC and X-Box three 60. Keep in mind since this game has
3555420	3563020	come out, we had saints row four and we had the ages of mayhem while not technically out of hell.
3563020	3567900	That's right. So while technically agents of mayhem was fucking saints row, but it was terrible
3567900	3571740	because they couldn't, they, they decided, Oh, Hey, we're going to make this really awesome hero
3571740	3577260	shooter game. And then they're like, Oh crap, no one gives a shit about our awesome shooter game.
3577260	3581020	Let's put saints broke characters in there and confuse the fuck out of everybody and piss off
3581020	3585500	the saints or offense at the same time. Fine. What he said. Cause like I saw that the other
3585500	3590140	day for 1499, I'm like, that's still too much to pay for that game. I'm not buying that.
3590140	3594140	Here's the thing though. Saints wrote the third on switch will include all the DLC.
3594140	3598220	So it will be kind of more of an all one. That is one thing that saints row, the third and the
3598220	3603660	fourth did, um, quite well is they used to overcharge for DLC. So that is nice that that's
3603660	3607500	in there. That includes all like the Tron DLC and all that. Well, I mean, it's not Tron, but wink,
3607500	3611740	wink, right? It was that hacker group or whatever the crime. No, that was actually part of the game.
3611740	3617900	Oh, what's it? I thought that was, no, that was one of the, the boss guys that you fight against.
3617900	3622940	Okay. Who ends up becoming a good guy in the next game. But do you think there is an audience for
3622940	3626780	this? I like, I, it's one of those things where I kind of laugh at it and I go, Oh my God,
3626780	3630780	what a, another port. But then I kind of go, well, it depends on the cost. If they're going
3630780	3637180	to try to charge $49.99 for this shit when it comes out, fuck them. I mean, cause I got this
3637180	3643500	on like humble bundles for like, I think it was like a dollar. I mean, maybe like five bucks at
3643500	3650940	the moment. There is, there is an audience out there of gamers, Nintendo, $20 maybe. And that's,
3650940	3657500	I think a bit much, uh, dark Tetsuya says it's $49.99. They can fuck right off. I'm serious.
3657500	3662460	They can fuck right the hell off. Cause they would be different if it was like, you know,
3662460	3666220	here's the Loki. You and I both know it's going to be $49.99 for like the first month.
3666780	3670300	And that price is going to come down real fast. They can seriously fuck right off because I'm,
3671180	3678700	that is, he says IDK, actually IDK. Okay. All right. But if it's $49.99, that is way too
3678700	3683900	fucking much. $29.99 I think is going to be way too much for it. I mean, it's a fucking old ass
3683900	3689820	game and they're not like enhancing anything on it. Oh, we're throwing in the DLC. Big fucking
3689820	3695020	whoop. You can get that shit on PC. It was like a multiplayer you could do like in the same room.
3695020	3704780	Maybe Diablo is kind of going, they did in land parties. Me being a big fan of saves row. Yes. I
3704780	3713020	did play the multiplayer mode in there. It was fucking not good. It was, it's you basically it's
3713020	3720540	it's you PVE is versus a bunch of like waves of enemies and it's dumb. As she 100 Matt points out,
3720540	3725020	I like the developers are running to put their game on the switch regardless if it's old.
3725020	3728860	I understand it, but like if here's what they could have done to make sweeten the pot. Okay.
3728860	3733980	Cause saints row, the third and the fourth and even get out of hell ran basically in the same
3733980	3738860	fucking engine is pretty much the same. Almost the same assets, at least the third and fourth.
3739500	3744060	Why not just put out, Hey, here's saints row. Third through got out of hell. The saints
3744060	3749420	roll collection collection and then sell that for 49 99. That would be fucking worth it.
3749420	3755820	This shit. Not worth it. All right, well let's move on Loki. I mean, not worth it. I'll let
3755820	3762940	know the big clear, not worth it for 49 99 now, 19 99, maybe 14 99, probably a little bit better,
3763580	3770460	but eh, I'd be wary anything above that because you know, a lot of companies capcom like to charge
3770460	3774460	an exorbitant amount of money for these. Again, though, we all know it's going to come down in
3774460	3778140	price real fast. So, and it's even one of those things where like, and I know some of you might
3778140	3782300	be thinking like, God, do you like ripping off the developers by way of it's like, dude,
3782300	3787020	this game is how old I didn't tell you the port this to the switch. That was your fucking idea.
3787020	3790300	Clearly made their money back on this game or they wouldn't have made a fourth one. So I
3790300	3795340	really think anything that they're making on this is like extra, a little bonus, little extra money,
3795340	3799820	little extra something under the Christmas tree. So anyway, and the sad thing too is it's not even
3799820	3804780	coming out until next year. Okay. They're saying they have not announced a price yet is what chat
3804780	3808460	chat room has finally come to that consensus. They've not announced the price yet. All right.
3808460	3813180	Speaking of, is it worth it or not? Loki, we have an interesting change this week.
3814140	3820620	Okay. So, um, yeah, so Twitch decided that they're going to go ahead and change a bunch
3820620	3824860	of stuff that you get with the whole Twitch prime membership. So the first thing they're changing
3824860	3829340	is, Hey, you know, that all at all that ad free viewing that you had, well, that's gone.
3829900	3836540	So ad free viewing is going to cease after September 14th. Um, and basically they said,
3836540	3844860	well, the reason why we're getting rid of the ads is to, um, I guess it, to pay their creators
3844860	3851660	more money is what they're doing. So they're paying their creators. They say more money
3851660	3858140	because of this advertising is important or an important source of support for the creators
3858140	3864140	who make Twitch possible. You know, which creators it is. It ain't the creators like
3864140	3868620	little old me, the affiliates, or even some of the like, you know, partners that are out there.
3868620	3874940	It ain't for them. It's because, at least this is my perception. It's because the e-sports stuff is
3874940	3881180	really growing and growing and growing on Twitch. Overwatch league is who this is for. Those, the
3881180	3886860	partners, this is for Overwatch league and the heroes stuff. And you know, the, the Dota
3886860	3890620	tournament, even though that's a whole nother issue with the, the steam thing, uh, you know,
3890620	3897100	these types of big tournaments that are streamed over on, um, over on Twitch, I think those are
3897100	3902140	the ones that are really chomping at the bit to probably put more ads within there. Because, I
3902140	3907820	mean, these things that you're watching with like Overwatch league and you know, the heroes league
3907820	3913260	and what, all these other games that have the big league stuff streamed on Twitch, they're all like
3913260	3917980	basically like full on TV production. I gotta think though, that these guys, like a lot of
3917980	3922140	streamers I see that watch it or kind of the big time stuff. I don't think they make a lot of money
3922140	3927180	from ads anyways. I think most of that's coming from donations because I see a lot of like high
3927180	3933420	value donations coming in versus the ads. Well, a lot of the partners in response to this have
3933420	3937340	been like, I'm not gonna, don't worry guys. I'm not going to put ads, but I mean, you kind of
3937340	3942540	can't stop the ad that rolls before your stream. Well, I mean, unless you have Twitch prime
3942540	3947100	right now, uh, you don't see that ad. And if you subscribe to a channel, you don't see the ad. Like
3947100	3952460	I don't have a lot of subscribers to the Rob Roberts channel on YouTube. I don't have anybody
3952460	3958140	there. Uh, but over on Twitch, I don't have the subscribers there. Well, I have some, but to be
3958140	3962460	fair, I don't stream a lot. I don't stream enough. If I was doing it three times a week, I'd probably
3962460	3967340	be in better shape with that. But anyway, I mean, they don't see the ads when you subscribe directly.
3967340	3973580	That's also one way to get around it. Or you can get Twitch's thing that they had before Amazon
3973580	3979900	bought them, which was the turbo thing, which turbo, which is eight bucks a month. And you get
3979900	3987340	ad free with that, which is lame. Um, and then of course, on top of that too, one of the things that,
3987340	3993180	um, I assume was part of this as well was the discount off of pre-ordering games. Well,
3993180	3999100	you don't get it, you know, prime members don't get 20% off anymore. Um, off pre-order games.
3999100	4003660	Instead, you're going to get $10 back in promotional credit on select games.
4006140	4010940	I mean, that sucks, but at the same time, I think a lot of stuff on Amazon seems to be cheaper
4010940	4017820	anyways. Well, okay. Number one, I think the one, two punch of this news was a really stupid thing
4017820	4023820	to do the day after we have these huge rumors about steam TV. Yes. It wasn't smartest timing
4023820	4029900	ever. That was really bad timing on somebody's part. Also, I mean, also actually the steam TV
4029900	4034140	thing isn't even a rumor like they did. They finally did push that this week. I actually
4034140	4037260	just briefly, I was like, I wonder what this is all about. So I actually checked out the steam TV
4037260	4043420	thing and you can see that they have really worked on integrating steam into a, you know,
4043420	4048380	Twitch TV type of interface where you can kind of go watch something with your friends. It's like
4048380	4052300	a thing that you can do private chat rooms with your friends. They've worked in all the emote
4052300	4057580	icons from the trading trading decks and stuff are in that main chat and in all that, you know,
4057580	4061260	and then you can see on the side where the friends are playing, you know, the jury's still out
4061260	4066220	cause you know, we don't know what the community is going to look like on stream steam. We don't
4066220	4071660	know what they're going to be incentivizing their creators to do. Right. We know on Twitch,
4071660	4076060	you've got the bits, you have ad revenues for partners. I suppose it will be interesting to
4076060	4082220	see what steam does for that because steam also has this whole element where they are also
4082220	4086220	a store. Now we see Twitch kind of trying to compete in that element. Maybe that's why
4086220	4090060	steam wants to get in this business. I don't know. But now we see that steam, you know,
4090060	4095980	you have a steam wallet that if you've ever like used it or you've ever sold like trading cards in
4095980	4100780	the marketplace, you have probably have some spare change in your steam wallet. Wouldn't that be
4100780	4106380	interesting if you could like donate steam wallet money to your favorite streamer and put it in
4106380	4111180	their steam wallet so that streamer could turn around and either maybe cash it out at a certain
4111180	4116060	amount or buy games with it. I don't know. It just, it would seem like a very like that.
4116060	4123020	It's already kind of there in that ecosystem. Sounds so ripe for exploitation with it does.
4123660	4128140	And that, you know, again, I've had a lot of concerns with steam over the past year
4128700	4132620	when it comes to a lot of the bullshit that's been happening on their store end. And the fact
4132620	4136620	that at one point they, what they threw up their hand and said, we don't need to do curation
4136620	4140220	anymore because there should be things on the storefront that piss you off. That was the dumbest
4140300	4143740	response. Except that they're still not following through with that. There was an article I read
4143740	4150300	today. It was talking about like some of these erotic games or whatever, like risque like story
4150940	4155660	visual novel games that they were still getting pushed back or even actually the one it was that
4156700	4163820	you must be 18 to enter game. Whereas like the mock, like browsing porno sites, you know, as like
4163820	4168700	as a teenager on like, you know, dial up and stuff like that where you have to keep look,
4168700	4171420	watch out for your parents and stuff like that. And you're trying to view porn, but it's all
4171420	4177020	ASCII art. And they're like, Oh, well we need you to censor this. It's like, it's ASCII art.
4177020	4180540	That's going to be really fucking hard for me to do that. Here's the thing. I'm still pretty
4180540	4186460	dedicated to Twitch and I don't see myself leaving Twitch, but I will, I'll approach steam with an
4186460	4189740	open mind. I'm always going to approach anything with an open mind. So if steam's going to launch
4189740	4193340	this thing, I'll approach it with an open mind. But the number one thing steam is going to need
4193340	4197660	to convince me is that they know what the fuck they're doing with this. And that's going to be
4197660	4201820	more of a challenge than you might think. Right? Because my thought once again is that like,
4201820	4206940	we don't have the resources to curate our storefront. So what makes you think you have
4206940	4212220	the resources to curate your storefront and this video service? Let me go to our chat at
4212220	4216700	live.vognetwork.com. Cause this is geo 100. Matt has a lot of great feedback on this, uh, as geo
4216700	4221180	100, Matt and chat says the company I work for handles a lot of event streaming that involves
4221180	4225820	us running ads during stream sporting events. Things like what Twitch is doing are all being
4225820	4231020	done by algorithms. No actual people. It seems like partners are in control of when their ads
4231020	4235980	play, but I think that is a bad idea because it can be abused. I hope in time it will be tweaked
4235980	4240620	in some way to make their streamers and viewers happy. They already made the mistake by not
4240620	4245500	including streamers in their discussions about this stuff. If you're transparent and forthcoming
4245500	4250300	with your community and actually listen to them, they will support you. Too many companies make
4250300	4254620	moves and beg for forgiveness later. Again, that all from SSG owner to Matt. Yeah. And the talk a
4254620	4259020	little bit about what you kind of referenced it a little bit. Um, some of the streamers as,
4259020	4263820	you know, they don't like the fact that this service is going away, this ad free service. So
4264380	4268940	they're to kind of, um, combat it and protest against it. They're just shutting off their ads
4268940	4273340	like fucking, no one's getting money then, you know, I don't need it. So it'll be interesting
4273340	4277980	to see what develops like this news is not enough to make me go like, Oh, I got to get off of Twitch
4278060	4285020	or any of that. I'm not there really with this. You know, I, if it's one ad before my stream plays,
4285020	4287980	I'm not going to scream and cry and hoop and holler. It's the end of the world.
4288620	4293340	But if they start injecting ads in my stream, when I'm not able to control it,
4293340	4297020	that's when I'm going to be really pissed off and start to go. I don't think mixer has ads right
4297020	4301580	now. Yeah. It doesn't have ads. And that's the thing is Microsoft's dumping money into mixer.
4301580	4306140	I actually was randomly looking at mixer because it was, it's on your Xbox dashboard, right? And
4306140	4309900	I just had my Xbox on and there was nothing on Twitch. And I was like, I wonder what mixer's
4309900	4314460	up to these days. And I was on like the Microsoft one channel or whatever. I'm like, fuck, they got
4314460	4319820	like this whole studio set up. They got these, this nice little set up. I'm like, okay, Microsoft
4319820	4325420	is dumping money into mixer because they really want this to happen. So it would be interesting.
4325420	4328940	I know there's some people out there that prefer mixer, but you know, again, it's nice to have
4328940	4337980	options. I don't think mixer, mixer isn't wooing the little guys like me. Twitch did that. Mixers
4337980	4343180	not doing that yet. Maybe they will, but right now Twitch kind of does that. Twitch has great
4343180	4347420	discoverability and I think we'll continue to do so with the tagging, I think is a really good idea.
4347420	4351420	You know, even though the communities are going away, I get that most of the communities
4351420	4356540	were just the games, but at least the tagging will compensate for, I think the stuff that wasn't
4356540	4362460	necessarily just communities. So, or game communities. So, yeah, I'm, I'm still, you know,
4362460	4366940	okay. They're gonna change this whole ad thing, but I don't think it's the end of the world.
4366940	4372140	I'm not gonna yell the sky is falling just yet because, you know, not everybody that watches
4372140	4380460	my feed has Prime anyway, and it's still working okay. Right? So, yeah, we'll see what happens.
4381420	4385580	Let's see. Rama in chat says Microsoft has the mixer studio at their Fifth Avenue store.
4386140	4390620	So that's expensive real estate. So they really, they really want to make mixer happen.
4392060	4397500	But, you know, I found, you know, 10 years ago when you're up late at night and you've got
4397500	4401740	insomnia and it's like, I don't want to go to bed yet. You're flipping through the cable channels
4401740	4406300	and like, oh, there's a South Park rerun honors, whatever it is, you know, just flipping channels
4406300	4411100	late at night. Now it's, oh, let me go on Twitch. See who's broadcast. Let me go on mixer. What's
4411100	4417660	on? You know, like, wow, how times have changed, right? Because even on Twitch, the crazy thing is
4417660	4424140	it's not all gaming on Twitch either. I was watching because Alan was sitting there with
4424140	4427820	me and we were, you know, kind of watching TV together. And so I was on Twitch and I noticed
4427820	4433260	one of the top streamers was doing like a live ASMR and Alan's kind of into all that ASMR stuff.
4433260	4437500	I see him watching the videos and all that stuff. So I was like, look, Alan, they got one for you.
4437500	4442060	So I was watching this girl that would just do the whole like, like the tapping of the microphones.
4446300	4450700	I guess it's I'm old or something. I don't understand the ASMR stuff, but anyway.
4454220	4458860	Let's see. Bobby Black Wolf says, now when I have insomnia, I go watch Flaco playing Splatoon at
4458860	4463900	2 AM. I don't even enjoy Splatoon, but I enjoy asking Flaco about Moret Towers.
4463900	4469740	And that Dark Tetsuya says, Oh God, is Rob on the ASMR thing again?
4470300	4474300	Yes. Maybe, you know what? One of these days, maybe we'll do like a charity fundraiser or
4474300	4481020	something. And if we raise like a hundred dollars, I'll do a special ASMR. Would that be fun? Loki,
4481020	4487020	would you watch that? That is not going to be fun. I'll eat it. I'll eat a pickle on a microphone.
4487020	4496300	Yeah. Thank you. Dark Tetsuya says ASMRob. I love it. Patent pending. All right. Let's move on.
4497020	4501020	Let's talk about Assassin's Creed. Something you will not be looking forward to next year.
4501020	4507100	There is not going to be an Assassin's Creed in 2019. They're taken a year off. And I think many
4507100	4513100	of us are probably looking at this going, not a bad idea. That's okay. You go ahead and take a
4513100	4518540	year off. Although I will say this new Assassin's Creed, the Odyssey looks more interesting than an
4518540	4523180	Assassin's Creed game has to be. Guess we know when Watch Dogs 3 will be coming out or whatever
4523180	4532380	Tom Clancy game. Anyway, in an interview with GameSpot CEO of Ubisoft, Yves Guillemot. I never
4532380	4537980	say that guy's name, right? Anyway, on Assassin's, we had a game in 2017. We have one this year.
4537980	4542700	We're not going to have a full fledged Assassin's next year. Notice he says full fledged Assassin's,
4542700	4546780	but that we do know there's been download games. So they may, they may do a tiny title or something.
4546780	4551020	Anyway, it's just because the team were working separately. So we have two games now, one year
4551020	4555260	after the other, but next year, you're not going to have a fully fledged one. So confirmation not
4555260	4560540	to look forward to that in 2019. But of course, you're right. Ubisoft's got plenty of franchises.
4560540	4564940	They'll have something else to fill in the gap. I'm sure. Let's get to Loki and then we'll get to
4564940	4574540	our classic game of the week. So Gabe Newell, he recorded some announcer voices for Dota 2.
4575100	4581900	And of course, you know, they had a mega kill pack, I guess, which had him recording different
4581900	4587820	lines for the game. And it was kind of funny as, of course, they mentioned, you know, some of the
4587820	4593100	lines in there. One of the lines of kind of playing into the joke that, you know, he can't
4594060	4599820	count the three. And so, of course, it says you have more than two kills, but less than four
4599820	4606060	because he won't say three. And it's kind of funny. Okay, I get it. That's funny.
4607180	4613100	Yes, it's irritating, but it's funny. And then I guess they have that coming out
4614540	4621100	right now during the international. So that'll be part of a update, I think, coming soon.
4622060	4628140	All right. Well, we're going to go on a way trip back. You know, I know the Dota 2.
4628140	4632460	I'm sorry. Yeah. And you can get that by actually purchasing the internationals battle pass.
4633420	4638860	Oh, so it's like included with the whole like watching the tournament along. Okay. All right.
4638860	4644220	Well, you know what? There was no battle pass back in the day. You know what? There's no streaming.
4644220	4650060	There's no tournaments would be at the mall. You go to the mall and compete in the latest
4650060	4656780	tournaments. It's the classic game of the week. And it's still my voice and not talking about
4656780	4664060	radio magic. Unfortunately, radio magic got broken. And unfortunately, dark soccer, not
4664060	4668060	able to join us for the classic game of the week this week. But you know what? Once in a while,
4668700	4672060	we get to play low gear. Myself get to pick a classic game instead. So that's what we're
4672060	4676540	going to do this week where I will pick the classic game of the week. So I thought I'm
4676620	4682380	going to go way back in the archives. And I thought I would go back to the Atari 2600
4682380	4685820	for this week's classic game of the week. And something a little bit timely because
4685820	4690620	we talked about a unreleased sequel to this game some time ago. That's right. Tonight,
4690620	4695580	we're going to talk about Keystone Capers is the classic game of the week. And there's the
4695580	4701660	brilliant Atari 2600 sounds playing in the background of this game. So Keystone Capers
4701660	4706780	was made by Activision. So it had that very unique looking cartridge with like those little
4706780	4711020	rainbow trails behind the policeman that was like the main character in this game with all that
4711020	4716380	crazy art. So anyway, Keystone Capers was made by active or published by Activision. And it came out
4716380	4722460	for the Atari 2600 in April of 1983. It was also ported to other systems. So it came out on the
4722460	4728620	ColecoVision. It came out on Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit systems, and believe it or not, the MSX.
4728620	4733100	I didn't even realize MSX ever got a version of this. That's really cool. So anyhow, the
4733100	4738540	inspiration from the series is supposed to come from like those old, like really old, like silent
4738540	4744220	movies where you had like the policeman that looked more like the Bobby cops. I don't remember
4744220	4747820	what they're called, but like the London types with like the big, you know, baton and the big
4747820	4753180	hats. It's kind of inspired by that style where they're trying to catch the robber. So anyhow,
4753260	4758060	you play as a main character named officer Keystone Kelly, and you try to catch Harry
4758060	4763820	Hooligan. Now what's funny is I mentioned a mall in the whole setup to this here. That's actually
4763820	4769500	the setting for Keystone Capers is it's this giant department store. So Keystone Capers,
4769500	4774700	part of what made it unique is that you had multiple screens. So you would run, it was like
4774700	4779420	you saw this world map on the bottom. So you would see this, you know, map that showed the department
4779420	4783100	store in the four floors. And you could see a little icon representing yourself and Nikon
4783100	4787180	representing the robber. And as you move from screen to screen, you kind of got a sense that
4787180	4792780	like, Oh, this mall is department stores like 10 screens long. You know what I mean? So the robber
4792780	4798140	would slowly move or excuse me, Harry Hooligan or whatever his name is, would slowly move through
4798140	4803100	the ball and you got to catch him, but you start on the bottom and he starts kind of like in the
4803100	4808380	middle. So maybe if you time it right, you can take an elevator to catch him, or maybe you're
4808380	4812300	going to have to just try to take the escalators and outrun him. But throughout the department
4812300	4816860	store, there are things that try to chase you like killer shopping carts that try to run you over
4816860	4823180	giant balls that bounce. And if one hits you in the head, I guess you're allergic to plastic balls
4823180	4827420	or something because it stops you and you have to start all the way from the beginning. And then I
4827420	4831900	don't know what these are like radios or something that you're supposed to jump over. Toy planes,
4831900	4837100	basically all this random shit that somebody was like, Hey, we could make an Atari sprite that
4837100	4841660	would kind of look like that. And it would fit the shopping mall theme. Any enemies?
4841660	4844220	Uh, fuck. I don't know. How about a big ball?
4846460	4851420	Anyway, the designer that made this game was Gary kitchen. Gary kitchen was the older cause
4851420	4855820	remember back in the day on target 2,600 only took like one person to make a game, basically.
4855820	4861020	Uh, some of the other games that, uh, this guy made, uh, donkey Kong, the arcade port on the
4861020	4866540	Atari 2,600 pressure cooker was the other big game. And then he did some stuff on the Commodore 64,
4866620	4871180	including a game that I know I have done a previously as the classic game of the week,
4871180	4875660	Ghostbusters on the Commodore 64. He did some additional programming on that game. So it wasn't
4875660	4881820	just himself. Um, but you know, what's also really cool. The, uh, individual again, Gary kitchen
4881820	4886460	behind Keystone capers also contributed to some of your NES favorites. You ready for this?
4887100	4893740	He co-designed and programmed with David Crane, a boy in his blob trouble in blobonia. Uh,
4893740	4899100	he also did Bart versus the space mutants where he was the lead design and programmer,
4899100	4903580	and then Bart versus the world where he did design and programming. So there you go. So kind of,
4903580	4907900	it's kind of some other stuff that he worked on, which is pretty cool. So anyway, I already kind
4907900	4911820	of talked about how the game sort of plays. Uh, and you know, it's one of those things where
4911820	4917260	it gets harder and harder. There's more stuff, more killer balls, more toy planes that they throw
4917260	4922300	at you and so forth. As you progress from each board, there is no end to the game. It just gets
4922300	4927580	harder and harder and harder, but, uh, the game was well received. I know it, uh, sold very well.
4927580	4932780	It's included in a lot of Activision, uh, collections. Uh, it actually won a certificate
4932780	4939020	of a merit or acknowledgement, uh, as the 1980, excuse me, 1984 video game of the year,
4939020	4946380	less than 16 K ROM. This game is less than 16 kilobytes crazy. Anyway, that was at the
4946380	4953420	Arkie awards. Uh, Antic called this game the perfect game for anyone and commended the superb
4953420	4960540	animation in the game. And it got three stars. The ColecoVision version did in the Deseret News
4962140	4966220	for all you, uh, Latter-day Saints folks that are following what's going on in the news.
4966220	4972700	Anyway, uh, there you go. That is, uh, Keystone Capers. Now there was a sequel, of course,
4972700	4977340	that we got into a little bit last week. The sequel never came out, but we know that it would
4977340	4982140	have taken place on a train and the graphics were pretty good because now it incorporated this whole,
4982140	4986460	like very primitive version of parallax scrolling, where you were really like going through the
4986460	4993180	desert on this train and it looked really good graphic wise. So there you go. Uh, Tigerclaw
4993180	4997340	points out, you can play this game free online right here and links to one of those eighties
4997340	5002220	arcade websites that you can do that. And, uh, yeah, uh, dark Tetsuya says better hurry
5002220	5006620	before Nintendo pulls the plug on that too. Well, to be fair, this is between Atari and
5006620	5013020	Activision still try to pull the plug. No fun for anyone as the internet goes where it disappears.
5013020	5018620	One place it'll pop up again. I know this game is in that latest flashback eight console where
5018620	5025020	it teams up with Activision and Activision compiles their games and does like release.
5025020	5030140	I know I played Keystone capers on like PlayStation or, or one of those lately,
5030140	5034700	like there was a recent compilation that had it in it because Activision always piles, you know,
5034700	5040060	they, they, they do these compilations resell our game, but to be fair, they had a lot of great
5040060	5045740	shit on the Atari 2600. These are classics. They did games like pitfall and pitfall too,
5045740	5051500	or also Activision, uh, the boxing game that was really famous on Atari was, uh, by them
5051500	5055740	freeway. Um, just all these games that were really, really good on Atari,
5055740	5059980	2,600 were all Activision. So anyway, there's one for your classic game of the week,
5059980	5066700	Keystone capers on the Atari 2,600, my pick because dark Sakura unable to attend tonight,
5066700	5072220	the radio magic, the interference was just too strong. Dark Tetsuya brings up another
5072220	5076700	Activision classic in our chat over at live.vognetware.com. I dig river raid.
5076700	5080140	I think that was one of my favorites. That was a great, uh, river raid. If I remember right,
5080140	5085340	was, uh, one of the first big, big, big games like that to have a female programmer and designer
5085340	5089980	behind that. It was that or the sequel. I think it was, I think it was the original river raid
5089980	5094940	though. Of course, now that I'm on the spot, I can't remember. Did you ever play any, uh,
5094940	5100860	Atari 2,600 games, namely the Activision stuff? Um, yeah, pitfall mainly. I mean,
5100860	5106540	I didn't really have a 2,600. I had a clico, but I have the 2,600 adapter. We didn't really have
5106540	5113260	a lot of things in ET. And Carol Shaw did do the original river raid. I just, I had to look that
5113260	5117740	up. I needed to know. So combat used to play a lot of combat. That wasn't Activision though.
5117740	5123820	That was Atari. I know, but still, I know they're great. We haven't had a whole lot of Atari 2,600
5123820	5128540	stuff. It's the classic game of the week. I know, uh, dark Sakura was more of a clico, more of a,
5128540	5132140	you know, she kind of had the other systems. So once in a while we got to throw out an Atari 2,600.
5132300	5139100	There's also, um, I'm not sure if it's 10 years yet, but halo 2,600, which is an official game
5139100	5145020	that is made by one of the creators of halos. You'll have to talk to her about that. All right.
5145020	5149180	Anyway, we're going to take a break guys. When we come back, we will have more of orange launch
5149180	5153740	radio, including rapid fire news. Uh, we'll talk a little bit about Fortnite. Guess what? We get
5153740	5160060	to bring up more switch online stuff and, uh, Oh boy, you know, I love my scary games, right? Loki
5160060	5165580	and, uh, the makers of until Dawn have announced their newest project. It actually, I got to say,
5165580	5169900	it looks really cool. That doesn't mean I'll play it, but it looks really cool. So
5169900	5174300	I'm played until Dawn. Oh my God. You gotta get on that. I have it. I just haven't played it.
5174300	5178220	Cause we got a free as part of the PlayStation plus thing, but all right, we got to get on that.
5178220	5182540	All right. Anyway, uh, let's, uh, let's take a break. We'll come back with more of orange
5182540	5194060	lounge radio right after this. Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight
5194060	5202380	on August the 26th of 2018 with episode number 743 of our show already in progress. Myself and
5202380	5207580	Loki here in studio dark soccer, of course, is still off on leave for a little while, uh,
5207580	5212300	due to a work conflict, but we hope to hear from her again real soon. Uh, again, we'll not be here
5212940	5218380	live. Thanks to a dragon con, but I hope to see many of you guys out there at dragon con.
5218380	5225580	Let's get back into some rapid fire news. Shall we Loki? We shall. All right. Okay.
5225580	5231740	So he seemed like you were so prepared for that. No, I got nothing else to talk about. I was just
5231740	5238620	posting a weird wizard smash ultimate reference into the, uh, God. All right. Anyways. Um, so
5238700	5242540	let's talk a little bit about Shenmue three, Shenmue one and two came out and apparently
5242540	5246700	it's Shenmue one and two, and they didn't really do a whole ton of shit with them and
5247820	5251100	make it somehow buggier and larger in file size. But
5252300	5255900	Shenmue threes, uh, right around the corner, actually about one year away.
5255900	5263660	It's scheduled now for August 19th is the release date. And, uh, I'm sorry, August, 2009, um,
5263660	5269740	August 27th, 2009, to be exact, um, PlayStation four and PC 2019. Right. Yeah.
5269740	5278380	Keeps saying 2009. Well, the game seems like it should be out in 2009, but, um, no. So August 27th,
5279180	5287100	2019. So almost actually one year away from tomorrow. So not bad to announce that. Um,
5287100	5291420	so I guess we'll have to wait and see if that's any better than the other two games because
5292220	5298700	I didn't really play them, but their views haven't been super great. I don't know. Um,
5298700	5305820	and then speaking of games in 2019, blood stained has been delayed to 2019 as well.
5306460	5310700	And this will come as no surprise, I'm sure. But the PlayStation Vita version,
5311580	5318380	it's been canceled. So I keep some, well, I can't say I'm incredibly surprised at that.
5319100	5324700	Yeah. So, uh, bloodsane though is going to be coming out next year. Of course, you know,
5324700	5329180	the Wii U version prior to this was also canceled, but they're doing a switch version. So,
5329820	5335260	Hey, maybe there's a chance for another port of the game. If PlayStation comes out with a new
5335260	5342380	handheld system, but until then, probably not. Can you believe that the game was crowdfunded in 2015?
5343180	5347820	It's been that long. Yeah, I know. Cause I'm one of the people,
5347820	5351740	one of those suckers that paid money for it back then, but yeah, I'm going to just hold out hope
5351740	5357740	that the game's real good. I hope so. I enjoyed the little eight bit game that they made. They
5357740	5362940	didn't really make that though. That was more of, um, was it the other team that did like
5362940	5369900	blaster master? And so I still liked it, whatever. All right. You didn't give, have them make more
5369900	5373420	games. They guardian legend, you know, you already know how I feel about that. That's how
5373420	5378860	it has come up on the show before. Anyway, let's talk about soul caliber six. I'm still excited
5378860	5383340	for soul caliber six, which is coming out soon. Uh, there is a brand new character finally there,
5383340	5387580	like most of the roster for soul caliber six is all like old characters, which is fine.
5387580	5390540	There's a lot of old characters that should come back, but there is finally another new character
5390540	5396620	announced for soul caliber six. It is a magician named as well, uh, a self-proclaimed leader of
5396620	5401580	humanity. So anyway, uh, as well as only the second original character in soul caliber six
5401580	5407100	after grow, which I don't know if I'm saying that right. Anyway, uh, his weapon is the palindrome.
5407100	5412540	It apparently summons other weapons out of thin air, even during his combos. Interesting. All
5412540	5417420	right. Final fantasy 15. Yeah. So anyhow, uh, what's interesting though about soul caliber six,
5417420	5420780	you know, we haven't talked about it in a while, but, uh, they're announcing some of the characters
5420780	5425740	as DLC already, including Tyra. Who's like the, the, she was the hoop girl from three.
5425740	5429500	I really liked playing as her and some people already kind of pissed off that like, yeah,
5429500	5433340	soul caliber is already like, well, the game's not going to be complete when you get it. Cause
5433340	5439580	we have all this DLC coming. So sell that season pass. So a $60 game is really going to cost a
5439580	5445980	little more like, eh, probably 80, a hundred. This is why we wait for the game of the year
5445980	5454700	edition for games like this. Anyway, uh, Bob coffee and chat says I prefer as well by his
5454700	5462700	true name, Nicholas mage is custom creator back. And I don't know if the custom character
5462700	5467100	things back in six, but maybe you can make your own anyway. Uh, moving on, let's talk about the
5467100	5470860	last remnant. That's right. You remember that game? That game is probably pushing 10 years old
5470860	5476300	itself. I think I have it in my library. It was an Xbox 360 game. I got it on steam sale one time.
5476300	5483180	I think there's like a squarey mix. I think it was Squeenix is first unreal engine game. Yes.
5483180	5487820	It was an unreal free game. I believe. I think that was what made this kind of a big deal,
5487820	5493420	but anyway, holy shit. It's like final fantasy, but unreal, man. It's going to be awesome.
5494940	5500060	The Xbox 360 version was kind of buggy. The steam version was apparently better. Um,
5500060	5503820	if you've never played the steam version, you don't have much time left to try it out.
5503820	5509340	You will not be able to buy this game anymore after September 4th, 2018, uh, in America and
5509340	5513340	Europe and September 5th in Japan. If you get a copy of the game before the cutoff,
5513340	5517820	you of course can still access it. You can still play it, but steam is removing the game on
5517820	5523740	September 4th at 10 AM Pacific time. Um, no warning has been put on the Xbox marketplace
5523740	5527740	about this. We'll see. Maybe on Monday, if Microsoft releases anything, uh, the steam
5527740	5531980	announcement also specifically is calling out the PC version of the game is getting delisted,
5531980	5537420	but again, no. Yeah. And the game is 10 years old. It was on the 360 in 2008. I thought I had it,
5537420	5545020	but I guess I don't see it. And went over to PC in 2009. No word on why, why would you, I mean,
5545020	5549660	cause I don't think it's music rights or anything like that. I don't know if maybe it's to do with
5549660	5556060	the ports and maybe the company that handled that or what. Maybe they're remastering. I don't know.
5556060	5559820	This is a game they're going to remaster. I don't know. Probably not, but, um, yeah, it's weird.
5559820	5564620	I thought I had the last room and it, maybe it's sitting in my humble bundles stuff somewhere.
5565500	5568860	Ah, who cares? It's 10 years old. Fuck it. I'm not going to play. If I had it,
5568860	5573180	it would just be sitting in my library gathering does anyway, dark to see you in chat says,
5573180	5577820	and that's why Frank is doing what he's doing. And that's the guy that I know does a lot with
5577820	5581420	the video game preservation, I think has that museum and everything. And, you know,
5581420	5586380	brings up a good point is that, and this is kind of goes back to all the ROM stuff we were talking
5586380	5591340	about some time ago is that, you know, sometimes when we're downloading games, it's not about like
5591340	5597500	quote unquote stealing games. It's about having a way to play games when rights and contracts
5597500	5601900	and digital stuff and all these other things lead to games literally disappearing. Now,
5601900	5605740	the good news about the last remnants specifically is that, you know, you'll always have the X-Box
5605740	5611980	three 60 disc. So it's not like that part's like $10, but yeah, but the steam version apparently
5611980	5615980	fixed bugs on the three 60 version, the steam version, I believe is the better version of the
5615980	5619340	game. At least from what I've heard, we will have played it. It's the better version of the game to
5619340	5623500	play. I swear I had that game. Yeah. I got to look at my humble bundle library now. All right.
5623500	5627180	Anyway, let's travel around and check out what's coming out in stores this week that will be
5627180	5634700	removed from shelves in 2028. Well, uh, I can tell you one game that's going to be coming out that,
5634700	5639740	well, there's already been removed from shelves at one time and that would be the blob too.
5639740	5645340	They're doing the remaster though for that. And so that's going to be coming out this week on the
5645340	5653020	Nintendo switch, um, blade strangers, which is on PC switch and PlayStation four. That was that
5653020	5659100	fighting game. That was by the guys that did guilty gear. Um, the game I've been looking
5659100	5663500	forward to, if you're a fan of Katamari, you'll definitely dig this donut country. It's coming
5663500	5669740	out on PC, Mac, PlayStation four and hype in this game a little bit. Yeah. It's going to be awesome.
5669740	5675340	So I'm definitely looking forward to checking that out. Um, a game called Fern's gate on the
5675340	5683580	switch and PlayStation four, a new PlayStation VR game firewall zero hour. Um, we also have
5683580	5691660	monster hunter generations ultimate on Nintendo switch pro Evo soccer 2019 on PC PlayStation four
5691660	5700860	and Xbox one strange brigade on PC PlayStation four and Xbox one, Victor Vran overkill edition
5700860	5711180	on Nintendo switch. Um, Yakuza, Kiwami two on PlayStation four. And then we have penguin wars
5711180	5719980	on PlayStation four, the messenger on PC and the switch and two, let's see, two point hospital on
5719980	5727420	PC, Mac and Linux, which I believe that was a followup to one point hospital. No, I think
5727420	5732140	that's a fun, if I remember correctly, that's a followup to like, maybe it was it life and death
5732140	5737260	or something like that. Um, Oh, I don't remember. I, there was something that I thought it was like
5737260	5742780	a followup to is that the hyper realistic surgical game from like the nineties that was on CD rom.
5742780	5747260	Maybe that was talking about, um, wasn't there a game called life and death that was, am I crazy?
5747260	5751900	Maybe it's sim hospital or something like that. I don't know. It's a hospital game, obviously,
5752460	5756860	but, um, I thought it was a followup to something. I remember hearing about it,
5757500	5765660	but I know life and death was like, um, it was a 1998 or excuse me, 1988 game for the software
5765660	5771820	tool works. It was a realistic medical computer game. That was the game life. So, okay. This game,
5771820	5776540	not that it's basically, yeah, it's a follow up to theme hospital. That's what it was. I'm sorry.
5776540	5783340	So basically, dang, life and death. That was kind of a fucking title form. Was it, uh,
5783980	5790780	appendectomies and we did it wrong. Play tic tac toe on the appendix. And that does that.
5790780	5799900	This kills the patient. Wow. It was only later on that I'd find out that surgeon simulator is my
5799900	5804460	game to go to for that type of thing. Um, anyways, so yeah, this is going to be basically a game
5804460	5808620	where you, uh, own a private, you privately owned hospital with the goal of curing patients
5808620	5816300	of fictitious comical ailments. So see as yeah, theme hospital followup. And then finally,
5816300	5820300	which MXC gets a cookie in our chat room for getting that right. He, he called out theme
5820300	5825740	hospital long before you got to it. And then finally we have a Naruto to, um,
5825740	5832940	burrito, shinobi striker. So Naruto to burrito and it's a fighting game.
5832940	5838940	Naruto burrito. It's a strange name. That's my drag name. Please welcome to the stage.
5838940	5849100	Naruto burrito. Anyway, uh, let's move on and talk about Japan. Guess what? Naruto to burrito.
5849100	5855660	Shinobi striker is also out in Japan this week. So, uh, Naruto knows no brown, no bounds. Uh,
5855660	5861500	also a game called world and syndrome on the PS four little dragons cafe is also out on the
5861500	5866540	PlayStation four. And, uh, this is a game getting like regular limited edition sound box, like all
5866540	5872860	these different types of additions. It's a game called side Vario delta. It's a shmup. Basically.
5872860	5876860	It's one of those like vertical scrolling, shoot them up type games, which sadly a lot of those
5876860	5881020	don't really make their way over here, but, uh, that is, that is apparently a big release on
5881020	5885500	PlayStation four this week. Uh, also though on a PlayStation four this week, that will be a big
5885500	5891660	deal winning 11, 2019, which of course is the soccer, a big series over there, uh, by Konami,
5891660	5897980	uh, pro Evo soccer, same thing as winning 11 in Japan. Uh, blade strangers is another release,
5897980	5904620	uh, over in Japan from Piki comes out, uh, this coming week on August the 30th, uh, quickly looking
5904620	5908940	at the switch to see if we have any big releases this week. That side very, our Delta is also on
5908940	5915820	the switch this week, uh, as is the blade strangers and a tennis world tour. If you're a tennis person,
5916540	5921580	let's let, let's head over to Europe. Loki. Yes. So this week we have monster hunter generations
5921580	5928140	ultimate on the switch, the blob to remastered on the switch victim ran overkill edition on the
5928220	5936620	switch, uh, strange brigade on PlayStation four and Xbox one Yakuza, Kiwami two on PlayStation
5936620	5945740	four, uh, firewall zero hour on PlayStation VR, uh, pro Evo soccer 2019 on PlayStation four and
5945740	5952300	Xbox one Naruto to burrito shinobi strikers. Well, it is a Naruto fighting game, just so you know,
5952300	5957740	um, that is coming out as well in PlayStation four and Xbox one SSJ who wanted her mat once
5957740	5964540	us to know. Baruto is Naruto son for those not in the know. The more you didn't realize
5964540	5970060	he was old enough to have a son. I mean, he looks so young. Uh, Naruto had sex.
5973500	5974540	Redo be fucking.
5978780	5982700	They grow up so fast and they have their own children. Oh my God.
5982700	5990300	Um, and then also we've got divinity original sin to definitive edition on PlayStation four
5990300	5999180	and Xbox one, a game called punchline on, um, the PS four, uh, shadows awakening on PlayStation
5999180	6007820	four, Xbox one and PC. And that'd be it. Ramo would like to clarify. There was a time jump
6007820	6013420	and burrito takes place about 20 years later where he be fucking.
6017100	6021900	Let's get to the mailbag. I have, I have no good transition. Let's go fuck the emails.
6023020	6029500	Fuck those emails. Participate at orange lounge. Radio.com is the place where you can send us an
6029500	6037420	email and we read our favorites here, uh, live on air at, uh, the show. So of course, uh,
6037420	6042540	we're going to be off for a week. I mean, if you're naming your child,
6043980	6050140	what name should I give him? How about burrito? That is an original name. That's stupid.
6051020	6055820	Name him something different. That one, that would have been like, your name is Matt. People
6055820	6063260	may not know, but your actual name is Matt. And if you'd name your kid, Pat, Matt and Pat, would
6063260	6069340	you, would your wife have let you do that? No, it would have been stupid, but it's even stupider if
6069340	6078940	like, it'd be like saying like, hello, this is Jeremy and meet his son bear me. I mean,
6078940	6081740	I'm pretty sure I follow somebody on Twitter named bear me,
6084940	6088780	but it means something very different than usually it doesn't mean you're the son. It
6088780	6097980	means you're the dad. Just so you know. Anyway, uh, I like Bobby Michael. That's just a theory,
6097980	6105020	a naming theory. I caught that reference as well. Can I get to the goddamn email? Yes.
6105020	6111580	Fuck those emails. All right. Our email tonight is unsigned. Uh, and it comes from it's,
6111580	6116060	it's unsigned. And I don't even know if I want to read it. We'll say K T Y because that's kind
6116060	6123500	of in the, the title of the Katie. I sure we'll say it's from Katie. All right. So it'd be Karuto.
6123500	6132540	You never know. All right. Karuto fine. Karuto. Karuto sends us an email that says this is,
6132540	6139820	this is email the century right here. You ready? Dear Loki, I love you. At least somebody does.
6139820	6147100	Also dark Sakura. I love you. Well, she's, she's not here to hear that unfortunately,
6147100	6150300	but you can always send her tweet or something. She'll project. We'll sit,
6150300	6154780	we'll pass along that I love. Uh, and finally, Rob, you're all right.
6156780	6163820	J K I love you too. Oh, thank you. That is all. Have a nice day. Oh, thank you. And that's the
6163820	6171820	email we got this week. All right. Well, that's, that's awesome. No questions. No, just, just,
6171820	6176220	just a little. I'm not, I'm actually not making fun of that. I, I, I appreciate that somebody
6176220	6180380	took the time out of their day to write that I do as active puts in the chat room, Rob,
6180380	6187020	Buto and Lakuto and the special guests that runs in and out of here. Mr. Smoosh, Ruto, Smoosh.
6187100	6193660	You too. Yes. Yeah. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says it's always good just to tell content
6193660	6198460	creators. You appreciate them. You know what? That is, that is true. That stuff holds some weight.
6198460	6204220	You know, it's no secret that the beginning of this show tonight was, was challenging.
6204780	6209420	But when you get an email like that, it's kind of goes, okay, this is, this is why I pushed through.
6209420	6214300	This is why we talk about, you know, the heavy stuff as well as the Naruto burritos of the world.
6214300	6218700	Like what a show this has been tonight. You, you can probably take two clips from this show
6218700	6224940	and people would not think it's the same show, but that's the way it works sometimes. Sometimes
6224940	6228780	this show can put you in a better mood than you were before. And I think that's probably one of
6228780	6233420	the best things about doing it. And I hope that comes through in listening to it as well. Anyway,
6233420	6237980	so I agree with Mr. Blackwolf in our chat, that it is always just great to tell content creators
6237980	6244220	that you appreciate them. And let me tell you listeners, I appreciate you. And that email,
6244220	6248620	even if it was unsigned and I can't really credit you beyond your given name, Karuto,
6249260	6252780	I appreciate you for sending that as well. And I love you too.
6254140	6259500	All right. Let's get into some more emails. And if you want to send us an email, I'm sorry,
6259500	6263100	we're going to get into more news, but if you want to send us an email for a future week,
6263100	6268700	when we get back from our week off for Labor Day, participate at orangelauntrady.com is the
6268700	6272860	place to send those emails. So let's get back into some gaming news and then we'll get you
6272860	6277340	your calls. Loki. All right. Let's talk about another game they don't play, Fortnite. But hey,
6277340	6283180	it is the popular game of the week, month, year. So you'll be happy to know if you play
6283180	6288940	Fortnite competitively, that there is some updates coming for you. Epic has made a statement saying
6288940	6293820	that we are aware of the strong desire from competitive players for more opportunities to
6293820	6299580	compete directly against one another within the same match. Development recently began
6299580	6306300	for a robust competition system, which will allow for all players to compete with one another and
6306300	6312540	be recognized for other accomplishments. So we have a lot to learn from experiments
6312540	6319580	with scoring schemes and formats, attempting to find the best balance between simplicity,
6319580	6325900	entertainment, server performance and competitive integrity. Expect for us to continue operating
6325900	6331580	and supporting competitive events after the conclusion of the summer skirmish as we lead
6331580	6342140	into next year's official Fortnite World Cup. Neat. Cool story, bro. Cool story PR guy.
6342540	6351100	No, look, I tried to play Fortnite. Maybe I'll try Fortnite again sometime. I don't know. I just
6351100	6355740	need to play with the right people. I think the problem was I played Fortnite by myself and I was
6355740	6359500	like, I literally have no fucking idea what I'm doing. Like, I might as well have been wearing
6359500	6363340	a bucket on my head, running around in circles going, I'm going to kill you with my wooden spoon.
6363340	6367980	Like that, that was my Fortnite experience because there's like no tutorial or anything to help you
6367980	6373820	in Fortnite. You just, you got to get good, bitch. Get good. Yeah. And, uh, I have a hard time getting
6373820	6379100	good. I'm 40. You need, I, I, you need to explain things to me. I don't have time for getting good.
6379100	6386060	Exactly. I don't know how much time I have left. I don't have time to get good. It's not like my old
6386060	6392460	job where I could play during lunch and then I got really good, but it's, it's my current job,
6392460	6396700	which our internet sucks. I can't play during lunch, unfortunately. Um, act Efton chat says
6396700	6401260	Fortnite with friends is so much fun. Alone is really difficult. Yeah. I kind of, I don't doubt
6401260	6405580	that that's the case to be honest. Um, and of course with Fortnite, there's this whole meta
6405580	6411340	thing that goes on. Um, they've got this rift that's been appearing in the game and now
6411340	6418620	apparently the rift has begun shooting lightning out and then finally the rift closed and a giant
6418620	6425420	cube has appeared and no one knows what the fuck the cube is, but I'm sure as Peter Molyneux will
6425420	6431260	be, uh, making a game to help us figure out what's in the cube. Remember I, did you like
6431260	6438700	that? Throwback in the center of the cube will be a Patreon. The center of the queue was a kickstart.
6438700	6441500	What the fuck was it in the center of the queue? It was like a Kickstarter or something. No,
6441500	6447500	the center of the cube was supposed to be, you got money for his stupid or from his stupid game that
6447500	6451980	he had out. I don't remember what it was. You were like the owner of the game. I got to make
6451980	6456380	decisions and you got revenue from the game. Oh right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was just like,
6456380	6461820	which did anybody hear about that game? That was stupid. Yeah. Okay. And no one gives shit. Um,
6461820	6467900	so no, what's in the center of the cube though, surprisingly enough, it's another remaster of
6467900	6474460	Skyrim in the center of that cube. I swear to God, no, we have to, we have to talk about
6474460	6479020	Peter Molyneux's fucking cube again because I swear to God, it was a Kickstarter that was like,
6479020	6482380	I know the guy got, but it was like a kid. The whole thing was a fucking Kickstarter.
6482940	6488700	No, they had a Kickstarter. Okay. No, he had a Kickstarter for his other game. So he did that.
6489820	6495580	But then he also had this stupid cube thing, which everybody's like, what's in the cube?
6496300	6501340	And then it just arbitrarily ended after people, I guess, mined away at it because it was like,
6501340	6506140	you know, you could buy stuff, the mine faster. So yeah, it sort of, I guess it was a Kickstarter
6506140	6510300	thing where they're earning tons of money towards it, but then it was just the crappy
6510300	6514620	goddess or whatever it was. Okay. So I finally found, so goddess, thank you.
6514620	6521980	Chat goddess came out, which G G O D U S, but I'm saying goddess, even though I'm not referring to
6521980	6527820	the show that they present in the show girls movie, cause no me Malone does star in goddess,
6527820	6530860	which would be an infinitely better game. I'm telling you. I mean,
6531500	6536140	I mean, if you open it up and it was no me Maloney, like fuck. Yeah, that was worth it.
6536140	6542540	Oh my God. Why hasn't anyone made show girls the game? Why is this not, but we, we,
6542540	6547500	where's telltale? Somebody get telltale on the line. We have had no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6547500	6553260	Fuck this shit. We have had the drastic park. We've had Batman. We've had walking dead.
6553260	6557420	The type of controversial content we need on steam. You know what we need? The one thing
6557420	6565340	that can bring gamers together in the year 2018 telltale games presents show girls the game
6566780	6572060	in five different episodes. Absolutely. I'm so, Oh God, I'm sorry. Each of the episodes
6572060	6578060	can take place in different locations, different places. You might say, yes. The first,
6578060	6584460	first episode back East where back East different places. You guys, if you've never seen the movie
6584460	6591980	show girls, I it's so bad, but it's so bad that it's kind of, is that a show that they do live?
6591980	6597420	Why isn't that a thing that we do at dragon con? Why isn't there like a panel room that we do for,
6597420	6601820	who do I have to call it? Dragon con to like get a room for two hours where we're going to do a
6601820	6609020	screening of show girls and just get super drunk and cackle at how bad show girls is. That's a
6609020	6614940	thing I need to happen. That's just like a meetup. I guess you could do, I guess anyway. Um,
6614940	6620700	anyways, before we got off on weird tangents. Oh yeah. The goddess, the game. Yes. We never,
6620700	6626620	it did come out in 2013 and has a whopping five of a 10 rating on steam. It's because it's garbage.
6626620	6631660	It has anyone understood that Peter Molyneaux is full of shit when it comes to his hyping of games?
6631660	6635420	Well, he made a good game called black or white a long time ago and fable was pretty good too.
6636060	6641900	But every time the dog, the dog is going to be fucking epic. It's a fucking AI dog. It doesn't,
6641900	6649900	it's stupid. Oh, you can pet that dog. Who gives a shit? Um, I don't know, but whatever. So anyways,
6649900	6653980	giant alien cube. Don't know what it's going to be, but eventually, you know, I'm sure we'll find
6653980	6658700	out what the hell does alien cube is all about and it'll be some sort of update or patch or
6658700	6663100	new mode or whatever who gives a shit. So that's going to be coming out at some point soon.
6663980	6668060	And of course with fortnight though, they are trying to get you to turn on two factor
6668060	6673180	authentication and what's kind of cool is if you do turn it on, you get your own emote for doing
6673180	6679820	that. So that's pretty cool. Uh, Bobby in our chat room would like to point out goddess costs more
6679820	6688140	than the last remnant on steam right now. Just, just in case you're wondering, it's garbage.
6689100	6694700	It's fucking garbage. All right, well, uh, Loki is probably going to keep right on that
6694700	6699500	attitude when we talk about another story involving switch online service. So here's
6699500	6706140	the deal. It was apparently confirmed that you will be able to use voice chat with the NES games
6706140	6711740	on the switch online mobile app. You know, if you're not figuring out discord by now or anything,
6711740	6716380	we have already heard that the Diablo three eternal collection will support switch online
6716380	6720940	mobile app for the voice chat in the game. Uh, that would be the second confirmed game beyond
6720940	6725820	splatoon two. Also any S games are going to do the same. And that is according to Nintendo's
6725820	6730220	official websites. This isn't rumors or anything. Uh, in the little, uh, section on the website,
6730220	6736780	it says with online play added to every classic game, you can compete or cooperate online with
6736780	6742300	friends, share your screen. That one's kind of different to a little new, uh, or pass the
6742300	6747900	controller depending on the game. That's something too low key where maybe what they're doing with
6747900	6752620	the one player games is that you can kind of, if you're having problems getting past a certain
6752620	6756380	part, you let your friend take over for a bit, clear that part and then take it back. Which,
6757100	6766060	although that is something that's already done on, uh, Playstations immediate that, that thing on
6766060	6770620	the PlayStation share play, even though it's already done on share play, uh, Nintendo is
6770620	6774140	going to have something like that too, which is fine. That's fine. That's cool for Nintendo,
6774140	6777820	uh, at least for the classic NES games, not confirming that for all games, just the classic
6777820	6784940	NES games. Uh, and then it says with the Nintendo switch online smartphone app, you can also voice
6784940	6790860	chat during your play sessions. So there you go. Uh, if you feel like downloading the app on your
6790860	6795820	phone to get ready for that, that's fine. Uh, again, I will point out, um, not only do we have
6795820	6801900	a discord that has chat rooms in it, um, probably a lot of people, you know, have their own discord
6801900	6806460	chords with chat rooms in them that I think a lot of people are using instead, but we'll see,
6806460	6810780	maybe there'll be an update to that Nintendo app that just makes it, Oh my God, amazing.
6810780	6818060	But, um, yeah, not gonna, not gonna hype that up. If, if we exist in a world where Fortnite didn't
6818060	6823580	exist on the switch and then we weren't aware that the switch was actually capable of running voice
6823580	6830220	chat through the switch, I might be fine with that, but we don't live in that world. We live
6830220	6836460	in a world where it fucking works with Fortnite, a completely more graphically intensive game that
6836460	6843260	uses much more of the processing power for the game. You're telling me that a fucking NES ROM,
6843260	6850060	with multiplayer, can't fucking handle voice chat through the God. It's so stupid. I get it. It's
6850060	6855660	an API or something that they're allowing people to support through their stupid app. But it seems
6855660	6862060	like it's almost like an excuse to say, Hey, look, we have an app. Ooh, we have this app. You don't
6862060	6867820	need the fucking app because guess what? The system's capable of doing it, but yet for some
6867820	6874380	stupid way, we got to make it really fucking difficult for you to do. It's like, how the fuck
6874380	6878700	am I supposed to patch in the audio from people talking? Like I got to get fucking splitter
6878700	6885580	between two different sources. It's stupid. It is goddamn stupid. I get it. There's other
6886540	6891500	things we could use in place of it, but why should we be using other things in place of it?
6891500	6896620	Just use the actual service that they have. I don't understand what the point is. It's dumb.
6899740	6903740	Sorry. In chat, we're making up titles for your second rant tonight.
6904620	6908140	That's only the second one? Come on. It's been more than two.
6908140	6912540	Start it. So you started off Loki rant to electric boogaloo. So I followed that up with
6912540	6917740	Loki rant to the secret of the ooze. Look, you ran to back in the habit. Loki rant to
6917740	6922220	burritos quest like Simon's quest, but anyway, forget it. All right.
6928300	6931980	Let's move on. You've got the next story actually, Loki. So take it away.
6931980	6940700	Okay. So let's talk a little bit about Pokemon. And we mentioned earlier when we were talking
6940700	6946380	about Switch that they do non-gaming things sometimes. And one thing they've been doing
6946380	6952460	is these long television marathons. And so they're doing that again, this time with the
6952460	6960380	Pokemon series, they're actually going to be streaming the first 932 episodes as well as,
6960380	6966860	I believe 16 movies in this as well. It made so many fucking Pokemon movies. Oh my God.
6966860	6972860	Yes. Like every legendary has their own movie. 16 movies. But they're doing something on top
6972860	6977500	of that, which is kind of cool. And I'm kind of sad that I can't really participate for a long
6977500	6983260	time in this, but during the actual marathon, they're going to have Pokemon pop up on the
6983260	6989980	screen. And if you mouse over them, you can catch them as like, you're doing like, um,
6991580	6995980	almost like you're catching, you have your own pokey decks and stuff like that.
6995980	7001580	And you can play that. So that's kind of cool. So yeah, they're going to be, um, doing,
7002460	7005980	geez, quite a few things. I don't know if they're playing the movies right after everything,
7005980	7009660	or they're just kind of integrating that together. But, um, it says apparently,
7009820	7014460	yeah, they're going to, it's going to be, how long is this going to go?
7014460	7020380	I'm going to have to be a couple months for that many episodes and movies. It's going to be awhile.
7023580	7029580	Oh yeah. The live stream says we'll begin August 27th and last into 2019. Oh my God. Yeah. No
7029580	7034220	surprise. No surprise. Uh, looking in chat at live.vognetwork.com. Uh, Bobby Blackwell says,
7034220	7039180	uh, Twitch actually has two channels that just do TV marathons. We just don't report on most
7039180	7042940	of them. They did Knight Rider and nobody said a thing. Yeah. I actually just randomly had it
7042940	7046940	on the other day. They were doing Korean dramas. Like, I don't know if I was on the right Twitch,
7046940	7050700	like the main one or whatever, but like it was just on my front page of suggested stuff.
7050700	7055900	And I was like, uh, they were, they were doing Korean dramas, but with English subtitles and,
7055900	7059980	you know, Korean dramas are kind of great. So I actually did watch a little bit of the one I was
7059980	7063260	like the way, the way they're kind of edited, they're kind of like the best things about
7063260	7067900	telenovelas as well as like, you know, the stuff we do here with like this whole other, like
7068300	7072380	dramatic spin put on them. So yeah, Korean dramas are great. So the marathon is this,
7072380	7079100	it'll start 1 PM Eastern time on August 27th and says, um, with episode one of the Indigo
7079100	7085020	league series or season. And apparently with that says from there, they're going to run for eight
7085020	7090460	hours Monday through Thursday with Friday and Saturday reserved for reruns and the movies
7090460	7096940	airing every Sunday at one. And then, um, with that, I guess, yeah, they have this Pokemon badge
7096940	7102540	collector. So that's that whole thing where you'd be able to, uh, collect Pokemon by filling out
7102540	7107340	your pokey decks, by clicking the icons that appear on the screen at certain times, this is
7107340	7113580	each one gives you a certain amount of points, more points earned, uh, for rare Pokemon. And
7113580	7119900	says, while these points will feed into an overall leaderboard, it's not clear what it's for. Neat.
7120700	7128860	All right. Go ahead. I guess. All right. Uh, let's talk about a new game and this is, uh,
7128860	7133580	a new game that is going to be from the makers of Until Dawn. That's that the creators of Until
7133580	7139900	Dawn are coming back with a series called the Dark Pictures Anthology. Uh, Supermassive Games,
7139900	7144460	of course, is the developer behind Until Dawn and they are launching what's called the Dark Pictures
7144460	7150140	Anthology. It's a collection of various self-contained titles that will take on different
7150140	7154860	horror genres. They're not saying if this is connected to the Until Dawn universe or not,
7154860	7157980	they kind of have a very similar look. It looks like they're doing that same type of
7157980	7163420	capture of the actors and actresses. It kind of reminds me that when they were talking about it,
7163420	7169500	it kind of sounds like, um, American horror story almost. Yeah. Like it's like, it's like a serial
7169500	7174060	basically, but like different. Yeah. So it's kind of cool. Well, the first game in this anthology
7174060	7178860	is going to be called Man of Medan and it's going to be in 2019 when this comes out. And it's a
7178860	7184220	group of Americans who find a ghost ship, which will have the game's namesake vessel while they
7184220	7189660	are on a diving trip to a World War II wreck. And they will find out that they are not alone
7189660	7195740	in this deserted vessel. Now, just like you kind of got used to an Until Dawn, every character in
7195740	7202460	the game can live or die depending on how you play. Uh, no pressure whatsoever. So it can just,
7202700	7207980	it can be a very, very sad short film when everybody dies or it can be very happy because
7207980	7213420	everybody will live. So there you go. Anyway. Um, they're not saying how many games they're going
7213420	7217660	to put in this anthology. I think they're leaving it open-ended. Uh, but Pete Samuels,
7217660	7223260	who's the head of Supermassive said there are 39 stories they would like to represent within,
7223260	7227100	you know, now I don't think they're going to do that many. That's a lot of games, but you know,
7227260	7231980	they, they have a, a nice, nice brainstorming list to pick from. So we'll see what else comes
7231980	7236140	out in that. So yeah, dungeon buster and chat at live.vognetwork.com says that the horror
7236140	7239100	anthology sounds like a neat approach and it's going to be cool that it's going to be
7239100	7243020	multi-platform too. Yes, it is. Multi-platform will not be limited to PlayStation this time.
7243020	7248940	It's going to be also on PC and Xbox one. I just hope they get back to, um,
7248940	7252140	another rush of blood game. Cause I need another rush of blood game.
7253020	7256300	Well, I don't even think Supermassive did anything really with that. Maybe
7256300	7259420	the site beyond assets. I'm pretty sure somebody else must have developed that.
7259420	7264140	I still want more. And you know what? I'm fine with even taking not necessarily that,
7264140	7270060	but like the whole rollercoaster gun range game. I'll take that. I'll just take another of that.
7270060	7275260	Whatever. I would just take Pokemon snap and VR. Yeah. Oh my God. Pokemon snap too, too,
7275260	7279740	too bad. We're talking about a Nintendo game on a Sony thing, but like a Pokemon snap game
7279740	7285820	with that type of like VR thing, it would be pretty awesome. How about brutal Mon snap?
7287180	7292140	You know, um, one of the things that I remember, I don't remember this as a story we talked about,
7292140	7297100	but data miners did go into some of the Nintendo switch firmwares and they're still mentioning
7297100	7305180	stuff of VR in there. So, Oh yeah. I've heard about, I don't know. I can't imagine with
7305180	7310300	the screen that they have right now that that would be too good. Um, but I feel like that's
7310300	7315980	one of those things where if they go to a switch deluxe or a switch thing in the future, maybe
7315980	7322380	that'll be the thing is like the, this, the turbo powered switch will be a switch VR. Maybe Nintendo
7322380	7327740	is leaving themselves some options. Maybe they're waiting to see how VR gets adopted or what they
7327740	7333100	can do with it. So maybe that's one door that they're leaving opened a little bit. You know,
7333100	7336140	maybe they won't do it for the next system, but they probably have some different ideas
7336140	7341340	out there right now. Yeah. All right. Uh, let's just do a couple more stories and we're going
7341340	7347180	to open up the Skype line at orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype. All right. Well,
7347180	7351980	let's talk about a new Kickstarter game. I know we all love talking about Kickstarter games,
7351980	7356940	but this one's called super patriotic dating simulator because there's dating simulators
7356940	7363100	about everything. But apparently this is the first, um, they said it's the first generation
7363100	7369420	Iranian American. Uh, they're talking about Carly as Malali, um, who apparently worked at cards
7369420	7374620	against humanity. So, you know, kind of already the type of humor that you might expect in a game
7374620	7381420	like this. Um, but to long story short, it's basically, um, dating members of ISIS to kill
7381420	7387340	them. It's kind of weird. Like you fuck them to death, I guess. I don't really know what,
7391020	7399420	um, yeah. Video games are sure art, aren't they? Yes. Let me read some of these screenshot quotes
7399420	7407580	because this is awesome. And this is, was it Cali? I'm just worried you might be using me.
7407580	7412620	I'm tired of casual sex and beheadings. I want something that's meaningful,
7412620	7418060	something that will last only then will I give you my gift or let's, uh, this way.
7418860	7425980	It's just a heavy Simtar and I get pretty sweaty practicing my moves. Do you think it's too much?
7425980	7432060	Excuse me for being so juicy in front of you. Can somebody just clip that?
7432060	7438620	Oh yes. So we can put that in a future YYR game or something. I don't know. All right.
7438620	7442540	So it's just, I think it's just, it's like a dating Sim parody. That's just like,
7443100	7446860	it's satire obviously. And it's just more of, um,
7449020	7454220	it's just weird sense of humor. I think it's let's, let's just be, let's just not kid ourselves.
7454220	7458780	It's kind of garbage. It's just some garbage going on Kickstarter. That's getting everybody
7458780	7464380	talking because it's like fucking crazy. Can we get, how fucking crazy can we get?
7464380	7468860	And so we got really high pigeon. This is what came up. We thought dating pigeons was
7469820	7475260	the barrel bottom. I guess that's true. All right. Well, before we get to the Skype line,
7475260	7480780	let's talk about video game sales. And so the NPD numbers for July, not that sales are everything,
7480780	7485900	but remember in June it was kind of interesting because the classic NES was the top selling
7485900	7491900	system of the month. Well, that did not happen this time. This time, the Switch, I believe was
7491900	7498060	the best-selling piece of hardware. Yes. Based on units sold and dollar sales. So it is back on top.
7498700	7504700	PlayStation 4 is still the best-selling console year to date. Xbox One is still up 60% year to
7504700	7511020	date and 50% in July. So, you know, everybody's kind of doing pretty well there. And what's also
7511020	7518220	kind of the real part worth mentioning here, the top-selling game of July, 2018, I would say is a
7518220	7524220	little bit surprising. The top-selling game of July was Octopath Traveler on the Switch. So,
7524860	7530060	you know, this was a title that I think was a little more experimental in nature by Square.
7530060	7539100	So I think needless to say, it's mission successful. I'm glad to do well. Not to downplay it,
7539100	7545580	but July is a very slow month. But, I mean, it's nice to see that that game did well because I
7545580	7551420	would like to see more games like that come out. Yeah. Well, the second best-selling title for July
7551420	7557260	was Grand Theft Auto 5. Still, all this time later. I mean, keep adding stuff to it. Well,
7557260	7561580	those games just never gonna die. It sells and sells and sells and sells. And then number three,
7561580	7566460	Mario Kart 8. Again, how long has that game been out? And it's still selling like crazy.
7566540	7572060	I'm surprised. Number four, the Crash Bandicoot Insane Trilogy. Number five,
7572060	7575260	Zelda Breath of the Wild. As people are getting these switches, they're buying the must-have
7575260	7582060	games. Number six, Far Cry 5. Number seven, Super Mario Odyssey. Number eight, The Crew 2. Number
7582060	7589820	nine, Tom Clancy Rainbow Six Siege. And number 10, Mario Tennis Aces. So, I mean, you kind of have
7589820	7594700	a mix of like some new stuff, but then like just stuff that's been up there for a long, long time.
7594700	7600220	I'm trying to look down the list. They have the top 20 and 19 is Minecraft. Still,
7601260	7605420	still like who doesn't own Minecraft at this point? They just, well, Minecraft, I mean,
7605420	7610220	they were releasing new updates and everything. True. So they just have the, you know, aquatic
7610220	7615660	update. And so that kind of pushed it a little up to the forefront. By the way, did you do any
7615660	7619900	looking into a Realm stuff? Cause I remember we were talking about that. I didn't end up,
7619900	7623420	cause I ended up going out after the show last week. So I didn't really get into the Realm stuff.
7623420	7626940	And then I was thinking about doing it tonight, but I'm off to DragonCon in like two days.
7626940	7630220	So I don't want to start it now. So unfortunately is going to need to wait till I get back from
7630220	7634300	DragonCon. But then I pro I was thinking about it and I was like, Oh, I do. I want to get that
7634300	7637900	started. But then it was like, well, maybe I'll do that after OLR on Sunday. And then I was like,
7637900	7641180	wait a minute. That would be like a horrible time to start it. Cause you'll come back in like four
7641180	7646700	days and Loki will have ruined everything while you were gone. I'm just joking. I'm joking. But
7646700	7651580	you know what I mean? Like, it's like, Oh, I will have had hardly any time to play. So we'll do that
7651580	7655020	when I get back. We only built the giant snowman death machine one time.
7656620	7660940	All right. We are going to open up the Skype line. It is open now for your calls at orange
7660940	7664860	lounge radio, all one word on Skype. If you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've
7664860	7667900	talked about tonight, or maybe you have something else you'd like to bring up. Maybe there's a new
7667900	7671740	story we haven't touched on yet that you want to talk about. Orange lounge radio, all one word on
7671740	7676940	Skype. It is open now. While we see if anybody's going to call in tonight, Loki, do you have any,
7676940	7680780	remember this your last chance for two weeks? Uh, Loki, do you have any last minute stories
7680780	7688300	or things we haven't talked about yet? Um, I did not at the moment have anything to talk about.
7688300	7692220	Well, lucky you, cause we're getting a phone call coming in. So hi, you're on orange launch radio.
7692220	7703740	Who's this? Hola, it's orange lounge radio. Your audio is not working. We cannot hear you.
7705420	7707420	Have you tried turning it off and then on again?
7707420	7714540	I did uninstall a Pokemon go and it seems to work better now. Did it really? Yeah. Hopefully
7714540	7719740	that person will see, you know, give it more. Yeah. You wait, wait until you're trying to
7719740	7724540	run remnant. I know I bought this. I remember having it, but maybe I'm stuck on this. Are
7724540	7729100	you sure it wasn't on the three 60? I thought about that. Maybe I got it free with like the
7729100	7733100	games of the gold stuff. And so maybe that's what I'm thinking of. Was it a games of gold thing?
7733100	7739420	Is it backwards? But this may have been before they were backwards compatible. Maybe I'm not
7739420	7751580	sure. It was, um, yeah, I don't see it unless it's under L and last word. No, no. Apparently
7751580	7758780	you don't have it. Maybe I did have it, but Oh, well who cares? A little late now. It's 10 bucks.
7758780	7764300	That's too much for me to pay for a 10 year old game. Uh, are there any, uh, I'm trying to think
7764300	7768380	like what's on my steam wishlist these days. I still feel like I have some games on there that I
7768380	7772220	want to get around to playing, but you know, I just, a lot of stuff that I think is on my
7772220	7777100	steam wishlist is stuff that I own on console. I want to get in the streaming, but I don't have
7777100	7783580	a place to do that. And that's my problem right now. So, um, I thought about moving everything
7783580	7790700	into the garage, but I don't want to sit on the garage. Yeah, well we did orange launch radio in
7790700	7795420	a garage for a long time. Remember your garage wasn't as bad as my garage. It was at least had
7795420	7801660	that garage where the, the shell or the, um, bench that I have work bench, the cat box is right
7801660	7808860	underneath it. So that's nice. And also right now my work bench is covered with my 3d printer stuff,
7809580	7816620	which is all over the place. And so, yeah, didn't do anything with that 3d printer either,
7816620	7820060	which is unfortunate because it was like, Oh yeah, I'm going to build a console like the switch.
7820060	7823260	Then I got switched. I'm like, well, I don't have to do that anymore. Oh yeah. I'm going to use it
7823260	7827020	to build DDR pets. Then I got DDR machine. Well, don't need to do that anymore. Well,
7827020	7832700	shit. I don't know what I'm gonna use this for anymore. So yeah, well, um, my number one, uh,
7832700	7836380	my wishlist right now is donut country. So I'll probably pick that up. You know, obviously next,
7837100	7840700	I can't find my wishlist on the mobile app. Can you not access your wishlist?
7843260	7847180	I still have monsters and monocles on my wishlist. I should probably pick that up because,
7847180	7851740	you know, we want to support local indie developers. And that game, he, I don't think
7851740	7857180	they've ever put it on sale, but you know what? I, I'm kinda, I'm, I'm okay with that. Like,
7857180	7860860	I think especially for like, especially indie devs, like I'm okay. If you want to make that
7860860	7864860	decision that you're never going to put your game on sale, like, you know, buy it for this or don't
7864860	7870380	buy it. Yeah. Don't sit around and wait for something. As you 100 Matt points out, I will
7870380	7874700	watch a Loki stream of anything. All right. I'm going to hope that some calls get in. I'm going
7874700	7878940	to give it one more chance here. Orange launch radio, all one word on Skype. It's just, I can't,
7878940	7882300	I could stream stuff, but I wouldn't be able to talk over it because I would be,
7883100	7889100	um, getting in the way with, it would be too loud. All right. Let's try this again. Hi,
7889100	7893500	you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? I hate Skype with a passion. We have made it.
7893500	7901020	How are you buddy? I'm pretty good. I, I'm kind of frazzled about today. Not really shell shocked,
7901020	7908700	but it's just got me reflecting. I think that's a good word for it. Reflective. Yes. Yes. Well,
7908700	7912620	what's on your mind? What did you want to call about tonight? Oh, three things. One,
7913180	7918940	let's get the giant pink elephant out of the room. Cause I'll make this as quick as possible
7918940	7925100	in regards to something that I posted on my fan page. I remember, you know, as a kid playing
7925100	7930460	Nintendo friends coming over playing Nintendo cousins coming over and playing Nintendo,
7930460	7936060	we would do our own home tournament thing and stuff. And yeah, we'd get mad,
7936700	7943020	throw controllers. We fight, you know, I mean, but then we realize, you know,
7943020	7950620	stop, relax, you know, it's just a game. We'd apologize. And we continue playing. It's like,
7951580	7957500	and as we got older, it was like, yeah, we did this, but we always threw our fists up. It was
7957500	7966700	no reason, you know, for this, you know, and I, that's what got me like reflecting and I'm seeing
7967660	7977180	what's going on. It's like the times are changed. It's like, you lost, take the L, move on. I get
7977180	7984540	it. I understand it, but I sure as fuck do not agree with what happened. There are better ways
7984540	7991980	to handle this much better ways. I just, you know, that the asshole took his own life. So we can't
7991980	7996460	even ask what the fuck were you thinking? You know, he's a fucking coward, plain and simple.
7996620	8001020	And there's a meme going around. They're saying, don't mention his name, call him what he is,
8001020	8003580	bitch boy. And you know what? That's exactly what I call him.
8004860	8010540	I, yeah, I don't, yeah, I don't feel like glamorizing him or his name or anything like
8010540	8015100	that, you know, especially during this time. It's just, it's just, but I think like you,
8015100	8019260	I just have so many questions. Like, I'm just so frustrated that, you know, this guy, you know,
8019260	8025180	did what he did and then isn't gonna, you know, does, does this where he can't answer questions
8025260	8029660	that we can try to prevent it again? Like, what made you even fucking think that this was a
8029660	8032220	rational response to a situation? You know what I mean?
8036220	8040220	To what you were saying before about, you know, this coming into our community,
8040860	8047500	this has been on the edge of our community for a while. We're going back to the, to the two guys
8047500	8053020	that threatened to shoot up a Pokemon tournament in Boston. And thankfully the police followed that
8053020	8058940	and stopped them. Let us not forget that you had that one cracked out dude who wanted to go after
8058940	8065340	Jason David Frank at that Comic-Con. And now I'm hearing rumblings in the cosplay community that,
8065340	8069340	Oh, they're going to get, they're getting all upset because, because what's going on
8069340	8073820	is there'll be more security at the, at the convention centers and the hotels.
8073820	8077900	And they're not going to be able to take, bring their props and certain stuff in. And I'm like,
8077980	8083100	as a friend of mine said, if you are more concerned about the fact that you cannot bring
8083100	8089020	your prop into a location because of security issues, you need to get out of the community
8089020	8094140	in a heartbeat. You just need to go because it's not about you. It's about everybody else.
8095580	8101100	Yeah. I it's, it's just a prop. And honestly, if you took a big fluorescent plastic sword or
8101100	8104940	whatever, whatever that is they're banning, you know, I think people would understand
8104940	8109180	what it's supposed to represent and not like, you know, people are not going to be like,
8109180	8113260	Oh, I can't believe they didn't have something lifelike with what's going on in the world today.
8113260	8116780	You know, do a photo shoot or something where you can do those things, you know,
8116780	8123180	you can, you'll be, your Instagram will be fine. Yeah. And the last thing I want to say
8123180	8127900	real quick before I get out of here, in regards to Twitch and the different things that's on there,
8127900	8133820	one of our staffers, one of our co-hosts, Ichigo, she goes on Twitch from time to time,
8134540	8139020	under the creative section, does a live stream of her work in progress of her cosplay. So that's
8139020	8143900	really cool. Oh yeah. Yeah. I've heard costume makers and costume processing and stuff is a,
8143900	8148300	is another kind of side to Twitch. That's pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah. Cause you know,
8148300	8152140	as I'm going to conventions and stuff, I'm like, I would like to jump on Twitch and
8152860	8157740	unlike Ari, I'm not going to, I really can't sit here and play video games all day. I mean,
8157740	8162540	I could probably do a stream of me, you know, working in Lightroom and talking to people as I'm
8162540	8167580	editing these photos or just taking out the laptop and running a live stream of the conventions
8167580	8171660	masquerade and just stuff like that, which is really cool, you know? Yeah.
8174300	8179340	Yeah. I, there's, there's a lot of experimental stuff you can do on Twitch. And I think that
8179340	8184540	side of it's just really going to grow, you know? Definitely. And let's see where it takes us,
8184540	8189740	you know? Absolutely. Who knows what might show up on Twitch in the future. Anything's possible.
8189740	8195260	All right. We'll see you later, my friend. Take care. One more thing before I go. I just
8195260	8198620	need one quick favor for you. Yeah, of course. Have a drink for me this weekend.
8199740	8204220	For you, buddy. I'll have two. I love you, man. All right. Take care, my friend.
8205820	8209260	Bye. All right. We'll see if anybody else wants to get, that was the call I was trying to get in
8209260	8212460	earlier, but we'll see if anybody else wants to get in real quick. Orange Lounge Radio,
8212460	8217820	all one word on Skype. Um, anything you wanted to talk about that you found during the call there?
8217820	8221660	No, I'm just reading up on Minecraft Realms. Oh, really? It's actually up to 11. Well,
8221660	8227180	it's total 11 players. If you get the jumbo one, it's 11. You can only, or is it that many people
8227180	8231580	at once? Or you can only invite 11 players simultaneous. Okay. How many people can you
8231580	8235020	invite? I don't think there's a limit. Oh, that's good. Okay. Cause I don't want to be limited.
8235020	8239980	Cause we never really did get that high concurrent player. So everyone plays at a different time
8239980	8244380	usually. Right. But then the other thing too, that would be different now than when you had
8244380	8248220	your own Minecraft server was that, you know, you kind of had to have that older Java edition
8248220	8252060	of Minecraft, you know, which was all that you had at the time, because you had to have that.
8252060	8257820	But now like with the realms, that's how you connect, not just PC Java version. Yeah. With
8257820	8262380	the realms too, if you can, but I'm not going to separate. I'm not going to be because I want to
8262380	8267740	be able to have the switch people with the windows 10 people with the X-Box people, sorry, PlayStation
8267740	8271740	people, but that's Sony's problem. So, you know, everything, everything else have that all
8271740	8275500	connected and, you know, so that people can play on whatever their devices. Cause I imagine there's
8275500	8279660	a lot of people that are only playing Minecraft, like on the switch, you know, or only playing it.
8279660	8285980	It's all the tablet and mobile stuff is all integrated to my kids play. Although my son
8285980	8289180	doesn't really know how to play. He just kind of wonders. Well, actually, no, I take that back.
8289180	8293580	I'm gonna see my oldest son, Josh. He's been playing on his tablet. I'm like, why aren't
8293580	8297980	you playing on your computer? We got you a brand new laptop that runs my craft really well.
8298620	8304140	You have an X-Box one controller. Why aren't you playing it on that? Like, I'm like, whatever.
8304140	8310380	I don't want to play. So he's playing on his, um, I actually, I don't know if he's been,
8310380	8315260	he's been playing it both on the tablet and on the switch. And he has like this, he built a bank with
8315260	8321420	like, um, security cameras and stuff like that that he made and stuff. So he's been having fun
8321420	8327500	with that. So once we get it set up, I'll have to invite him. All right. Well, uh, I guess that's
8327500	8332540	going to do it for the show tonight. No other calls are coming in and we're going to be wrapping
8332540	8337180	it up here for two weeks. We'll be back in a couple of weeks as dragon con is this weekend.
8337180	8342140	I'm really excited about it. I wish you could go, Matt, but I understand why I wish I could go to.
8342780	8348860	I know, but you got maybe when the kids are 18. All right. If I'm please sooner than that,
8348860	8352060	we'll see. All right. Anyway. Uh, but that's going to do it for another episode. Orange
8352060	8355580	Ontario. Hey, as I say at the end of every show, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Oil Art
8355580	8358860	tonight, please tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the
8358860	8363180	show where every gamer has a voice, but you know, if the voices aren't here to air, we don't have a
8363180	8368700	lot left to air. So, uh, please tell a friend, uh, help us spread the word, uh, a nice five-star
8368700	8373260	review on a place like iTunes or wherever it is you heard about this show. Those go an awfully
8373260	8377580	long way as well. We appreciate it. Um, I guess that means we go around and get everybody's
8377580	8382300	final thoughts. Uh, I'll start, I'll let Loki finish tonight. Uh, my final thought is this
8382300	8387340	was definitely a show of downs and ups. So I just, again, you know, I know we had that email
8387340	8391820	tonight that we all kind of, you know, giggled out with all the love, but I, I do appreciate you guys
8391820	8396700	so much that, um, stick with us through, through everything through thick and thin and, uh, we'll
8396700	8401820	get through it together. We always do. I'll leave it on that note. Loki, how about you? Your final
8401820	8407340	thought? I keep working on building a game and keeps changing what I'm working on each week.
8407340	8409980	That's the problem. Can't get started on anything because I keep changing.
8409980	8414460	Cause you can't finish one idea. Well, I can't even say that. It's just like, I find,
8414460	8419180	you know, what, like I'm running into, I still, I'm actually, it's the idea I'm working with now is
8419900	8425820	it, I don't know. It's similar to what I had another idea I had before. And I even tried
8425820	8431420	starting working on, uh, it's time the car again. And then I tried because I'm like,
8431420	8436220	Oh yeah, I'll totally do it. Cause you know, unreal has a vehicle controller built into it.
8436220	8442780	Let me try the vehicle controller. And Oh my God, is it crap? It is so crap. And I'm like,
8442780	8449260	uh, no, I'm not going to fucking do that. So, um, yeah, but that may come later someday.
8450060	8454620	All right. I'll look forward to it. Speaking of things that'll happen when the kids turn 18.
8454620	8458620	All right. Uh, that's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio.
8458620	8463500	We will be back in two weeks to do it all over again. Thank you guys so much for listening to
8463500	8467020	the show. We really appreciate you guys. I hope to see many of you guys at dragon con,
