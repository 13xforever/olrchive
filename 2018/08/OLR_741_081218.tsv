14000	20000	Tonight, QuakeCon winds down, but not without having unleashed information and a truly appetite wedding trailer for Doom Eternal.
20000	22000	This is just one story and a week's worth of gaming news.
22000	27000	Stay tuned for this and so much more starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	34000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back.
34000	37000	It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	39000	Orange Lounge Radio.
39000	45000	Live tonight, episode number 741 for this, August the 12th of 2018.
45000	50000	I am Rob Roberts or MrRobRoberts on Twitter and joining me is TechmasterLoki.
50000	51000	How are you, Loki?
51000	54000	I'm good. I'm full of breadsticks.
54000	57000	And I heard you were mentioning before the show you actually got to play some games.
57000	59000	I did play games this week.
59000	61000	Good. We'll get into that in our gaming weeks in a little bit.
61000	65000	And I mentioned to you off air, I went to the movies finally.
65000	67000	Because you know I never get out to the movies. Never ever.
67000	71000	But I was finally able to go see Mamma Mia 2.
71000	75000	And I had to drive all the way to San Jose to find somebody to see it with me.
77000	79000	So there you go. I got to see Mamma Mia.
79000	81000	And yes, Cher steals the entire movie.
81000	83000	I know you were dying to know, Loki, but there it is.
83000	85000	That's my review.
85000	87000	So that's what's going on?
87000	89000	Yes. Yes.
90000	91000	Alright, anyway.
91000	96000	You might notice at the beginning of the show I did not introduce Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
96000	99000	Because she's been introduced enough times and we just said forget it.
99000	100000	Stop it.
100000	102000	So here's what's up.
102000	104000	She's actually going to be out of the show for a little while.
104000	106000	Everything is fine. Everything is totally fine.
106000	108000	It's a work conflict, actually.
108000	110000	So that part really sucks.
110000	114000	But obviously we have to do what we have to do to pay the bills and to live our personal lives.
114000	118000	So as you guys, I mean she's alluded to this a couple times on the show.
118000	121000	She has some changes going on at work and she's kind of doing some new things.
121000	124000	Well they did a little schedule thing and she's going to have to work Sundays.
124000	126000	So that sucks.
126000	132000	And the part that really sucks is that as far as I know, we're stuck that way until February.
132000	135000	So it's going to be a few months.
136000	138000	It's going to be Halo Classic Game of the Week.
138000	140000	You think? No. Here's the thing though.
140000	143000	Thanks to Radio Magic. We've been here before, believe it or not.
143000	145000	Even though people may be like, oh you know.
145000	148000	And it does suck. I'm not going to belittle that point.
148000	150000	But I have to move forward.
150000	152000	The show must go on as they say.
152000	156000	So you might remember this happened a couple years ago.
156000	158000	Something similar happened.
158000	162000	And so we used Radio Magic to get her here every week to do the Classic Game of the Week.
162000	166000	We'll do the same tonight and we'll continue to do that and continue to get her insight.
166000	169000	And if you still want to email her questions and things like that, you can.
169000	175000	Also, I'm told she is going to try to make it one show a month at the end of the month every month.
175000	181000	Because this whole conflict is affecting her charity stuff she does with Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.
181000	183000	Which she's talked about on the show. She's very big on them.
183000	186000	The problem is, they also meet on Sundays.
186000	191000	So this whole thing with Sundays is a really bad personal thing for her.
191000	193000	And again, you gotta do what you gotta do for work sometimes.
193000	197000	So I think she said she's going to try to do one show a month where she can go do her meeting and then come here.
197000	200000	So it's not like she's gone, gone, gone.
200000	202000	But it is just going to be for a little while.
202000	204000	Loki and I holding down the fort in studio.
204000	209000	Although I do hope to invite some of our familiar faces back.
209000	211000	And some new ones too over the coming weeks.
211000	214000	Not that Dark Sakura's presence can possibly be filled.
214000	218000	But we will do what we can to at least diversify the opinions here in studio.
218000	220000	Beyond just Loki and myself.
220000	224000	One way of course that we always diversify the opinions every week is you guys in our chat room.
224000	227000	Over at live.vognetwork.com.
227000	231000	Where you guys join us live on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
231000	233000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
233000	236000	Again our chat at live.vognetwork.com.
236000	240000	SSJ100Matt says, damn hope Jamie can phone in every once in a while.
240000	243000	Well certainly I will definitely take her calls as a priority.
243000	247000	I think she's working during the show so she can't even listen sadly.
247000	253000	But remember thanks to Radio Magic we can still have Jamie here for a little bit on the show every week.
253000	258000	SSJ100Matt is also asking in chat. Kind of changing things a little bit here.
258000	262000	San Jose is near MagWest was this weekend. Were you able to stop by Rob?
262000	264000	Sadly my answer is no.
264000	271000	And the double part about that that's kind of sad is because as I mentioned I was in San Jose yesterday.
271000	276000	I went out there to visit my friends had a baby a couple months ago.
276000	281000	And not to get too into personal details but the mom had some like medical issues after.
281000	284000	Everybody's fine everything's fine but she couldn't have visitors for a couple months.
284000	287000	So I finally got to go out there to see the baby.
287000	293000	And so I that was kind of the priority over and then we went to the movie together.
293000	296000	That's who I would see the movie with and you know it was a little bit kind of time between us.
296000	297000	And that was kind of the priority.
297000	303000	I did consider going by MagWest after but the reality is it takes me two hours to drive to San Jose.
303000	308000	So driven over that morning and then it was like I was already on my watch going it's gonna be nine o'clock before I get back.
308000	311000	And that's assuming I don't go to MagWest at all.
311000	316000	And I was getting text updates from friends that were there that were like oh they have keyboard mania.
316000	319000	You know I haven't played one of those machines forever.
319000	322000	But long story short I just didn't get over there due to personal stuff.
322000	325000	And I kind of had a headache coming on towards the end of the day anyway.
325000	329000	So I was just like you know what I need to just drive home and make sure I can feed Mr. Smoosh.
329000	333000	Because Alan's been out all weekend actually Alan went camping this weekend.
333000	337000	So yeah it's been like a crazy weekend all over the board.
337000	342000	But sadly no I wasn't able to get to MagWest and that's now two years in a row.
342000	345000	I'm hoping next year I'll have better luck.
345000	352000	Hopefully well next year part of also why this happened when it did is that I actually probably could have done this trip sooner.
352000	357000	But I had Clue and all those rehearsals that were taken like six weeks up to that.
357000	360000	So I couldn't get out there like before now.
360000	362000	So that also got in the way.
362000	366000	So that probably I mean I say it got in the way but I love doing that show and that experience.
366000	369000	But that will all not be a factor next year.
369000	371000	So I'm really really hoping there'll be a third year.
371000	374000	Hopefully me not attending does not get the whole con cancelled.
374000	376000	I would love to go too.
376000	379000	I'd love to go next year so that'll be good.
379000	383000	Yeah S.G.O. 100 Matt in chat says understood Rob you got to see the baby.
383000	384000	Yes I do. Yes I do.
384000	386000	And it was it was totally worth it.
386000	390000	Y.Y.R. in chat is asking about Jamie's absence here.
390000	395000	Last time Jamie was out for an extended period she knew in advance was this kind of dropped on her.
395000	398000	Difficult for me to answer.
398000	399000	I would have to defer to her.
399000	403000	I think she knew there was a schedule change in the works.
403000	407000	But she had a pretty good feeling she'd be able to get Sundays off.
407000	410000	And I think the fact that she couldn't did kind of surprise her.
410000	415000	That is my sort of perception based on what I've heard of what happened there.
415000	422000	But I do know for what she does at her J job again I'm not going to get into all her business that's her stuff to explain.
422000	429000	But for what she does her J job actually this change is a really good thing as to like what she's doing now.
429000	432000	So it's just a bummer that the side effect is.
432000	439000	But it's going to kind of put her back on the seniority so she's not or she's having to work Sundays which that part kind of sucks.
439000	447000	So anyway S.S.J. 100 Matt talking about Magfest the main music and games festival back east.
447000	449000	Magfest is going to be a free for all mess again.
449000	455000	You know the jury's out on if I want to try for Magfest this year which sucks because I really need to kind of figure that out fast.
455000	459000	Because I know the tickets in the hotels especially are going to be crazy pretty soon here.
459000	466000	But jury's still out on the Magfest Prime just because between Dragon Con coming up in a few weeks.
466000	468000	I can't believe Dragon Con is only like three weeks away.
468000	471000	And then I'm doing Final Fantasy Fan Fest again.
471000	473000	I don't know if I have the time off available.
473000	477000	Speaking of day jobs I don't know if I have the time off available to do Magfest.
477000	480000	But if it all works out I would love to do it.
480000	482000	That's for sure for sure.
482000	486000	Anyway let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.
486000	489000	We're talking about a lot of personal stuff but let's get into some gaming discussion.
489000	494000	So this is an interesting this isn't about this time like why why now.
494000	496000	This is like a business element.
496000	498000	Yeah this is a weird timing thing.
498000	499000	All right Logan just get into it.
499000	501000	This whole thing is kind of weird.
501000	511000	So there was a guy by the name of Ryan Hupp who was selling a copy of The Evil Within 2 on Amazon.
511000	515000	Now it was a new copy because he hadn't unsealed it yet.
515000	528000	Basically he had purchased a copy for the PlayStation 4 but ended up instead of using money to buy a PlayStation 4 he spent it on upgrading his PC so he didn't need a PlayStation 4 copy of the game.
528000	534000	So he went and sold it or trying to sell it on Amazon which people do.
534000	553000	So Bethesda as a legal firm Boris had sent a letter to him threatening legal action for noncompliance basically saying that he is an unauthorized seller and it was unlawful for him to be selling that game.
553000	560000	And you know to which you know of course there's the first sale doctrine which allows you to do that.
560000	574000	This law firm apparently though is they like to take action against the first sale doctrine because they even have like a page on their site talking about how they get around that which it doesn't make any sense.
574000	587000	Their reasoning for it was well it wasn't protected by the first sale doctrine because basically it wasn't in its original form which would include a warranty.
587000	598000	Which my thought is where the fuck are these games coming with warranties from because I know if I purchase a game from GameStop or something like that that's sealed.
599000	606000	How's that any different than purchase it from somebody else that's sealed. Where's my warranty difference. Is it that I can take it back to GameStop if it doesn't work.
606000	617000	I mean I think so actually like I think it's all in fine print but I think like in the in the back of boxes or something it doesn't talk about like a manufacturer warranty sometimes I mean it's one of those things.
617000	629000	Granted I hardly ever pay attention to question I don't know if they're necessarily going to question you know where you know you purchase it from maybe they would need a receipt or something like that to do the warranty on it.
629000	645000	Okay I see it. Hold on. So I actually I just happen to have in studio a copy of Rise of the Tomb Raider on Xbox One. Don't ask it was here in studio and sure enough if you take the discount you read the back limited warranty for your copy of Xbox game software in the United States and Canada.
645000	653000	So it says it's covered by this warranty within the 90 day period blah blah blah free of charge according to the process identified below.
653000	668000	Warranty claims should be made to your retailer. Return the and I can't read it because the little disk nub is in the way but some I'm assuming is return the game to your retailer along with a copy of the original sales receipt and an explanation of the difficulty you're experiencing with the game.
668000	678000	The retailer will either repair or replace the game. Any replacement game will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or 30 days from receipt whichever is longer blah blah blah blah blah.
678000	691000	So so I mean to be fair yes when you buy a game there is a warranty you probably don't. It's such fine print it's sitting there behind the desk who's reading they're full of shit then if that's the case because there still is a warranty through Amazon.
692000	707000	Because if you get a game that's effective and you file a claim through Amazon and you say hey this game is effective then the seller has to give you the money back or you have to ship it off to them or whatever the case may be so you do have coverage there.
708000	726000	But it's whatever the case would be normally what it's supposed to be is that as long as it's not basically the limitations on it is that it's completely changed from its original form like you know because they sell.
726000	735000	So so and Bobby says some comments here in our chat at live dog network dot com that I sort of he kind of simplifies it here he could sell it pre-owned since he owned it.
735000	740000	Your receipt is your warranty but the first warranty was between the seller and the original retail retailer.
740000	749000	So in other words even if it was sealed even if you never opened it this person that ends up buying it doesn't end up buying it as new because they would not be able to.
750000	758000	I mean if the disc is defective or something like that they are up shit creek they can't use the original receipt because there is no receipt in this type of transaction.
758000	764000	Now I just want to state I don't necessarily agree with this whole thing I think that's why I kind of said this is whole right this is weird.
764000	775000	And the reason why it's weird this is like a dude on eBay like what's what's the big fucking deal it's a dude on eBay like it does it does he sell five thousand of these games like to see how he's selling one.
775000	785000	Yeah see that's that's the thing like why like is Bethesda going to patrol garage sales across America like here here's here's why I'm kind of going like.
785000	798000	I used to sell sealed games all the fucking time because we would get like promotional copies which were just actual retail games and I would get like maybe three or four copies of a game.
798000	808000	What am I going to do with that. I could give them the friends that I had sometimes but I'd sell them turn the profit. Why not. Right. And I didn't ever well email from.
808000	814000	Well you know there is a why not is that because part of the terms of the promotion is that you're really not supposed to be able to.
814000	825000	But that was a long no it was a long time ago. It was promotional as in it was it was people working for these companies that had they get free copies or extra copies and they're like here I don't want this crap.
825000	839000	You take this. Yeah I'm sure if we wanted to dig into the legalese of it though we can find a problem with it. But I it was a long time ago doesn't matter. Here's the thing though. OK. Yeah I went to and I remember this is a while ago I went to the denials auction out in Roseville.
839000	853000	You know the big flea market thing. And so this was when they used to have the place across the street also auction town or whatever it's called. This is a while ago but long story short there was a video game booth there that's always there in this video game booth had all these games.
853000	873000	And one of the things they sold that they had for sale was a shrink wrapped copy of clue on the Super Nintendo. And I was like fuck yeah clue on the Super Nintendo like you know I which is ironic because I know I just talked about the movie not that long ago but I guess I've just always kind of liked clue in general and the whole you know fun murder mystery stuff.
873000	886000	But I actually did kind of enjoy the Super Nintendo clue game which was also on the Genesis. Remember that needs to be a classic game of the week some week because it was it was very different from the board game. Anyway I wanted to get a copy of a clue on the Super Nintendo shrink wrap.
886000	898000	I was like oh there was nothing that said it was new or anything like that. But I was like well that's kind of cool that it's still shrink wrapped. But I didn't think much of it. I was just like whatever you know in my mind I actually was kind of like new or not.
898000	911000	Those Super Nintendo cartridges are fucking rocks. This game is still going to work right. So anyway I bought it brought it home opened it up. I ended up putting it in there and as I'm looking through the instruction manual the back of the manual already has stuff written in it.
911000	925000	So my point is I bought a shrink wrap version of clue that was there to like be passed off as new and so forth. To be fair they didn't advertise this new. But it was you know it's certainly being re shrink wrapped made you think that or whatever.
925000	940000	But it was a resealed used copy is what it was. Now in my opinion if Bethesda wants to pick a fight those types of you know retailers that are selling lots and lots of them should be where they're picking their file.
940000	953000	They can't though because people there are people that you can't I don't even know how they're able to pick the fight like that because there's distributors I used to work for a distributor.
953000	972000	We sell copies of games to other companies like a person that may work in you know have a shop in denial or whatever but they're brand new copies. So there is no like oh you have to sign a form to be a special reseller of this stuff.
973000	985000	There was nothing like that. So all of this is horseshit from their lawyers. It's all horseshit. Good luck taking that to the court and actually arguing that first sale doctrine thing. See how that works out for you.
985000	994000	Now granted they're going to strong arm somebody because it's one copy. He's like fuck it. I don't care. It's just one fucking copy of a game. You know fine. I won't sell it as brand new sealed.
995000	1013000	Does Bethesda has something to gain from this because this sure looks it. But this has got to be all their legal company. They're contracted organization like these legal things. And here's what Bethesda said about it too. They're like you know unless you remove all Bethesda products from your store for it or was this.
1013000	1025000	No that wasn't. Oh here we go. But that does not and will not block the sale of pre-owned games. The issue in this case is that the seller offered a pre-owned game as new on the Amazon marketplace.
1025000	1037000	We do not allow off non authorized resellers to represent what they sell is new because we can't verify that the game hasn't been opened and repackage. Oh wait it was an eBay it was Amazon.
1037000	1057000	Yeah it was on Amazon. Oh I thought it was eBay this whole time. You can do the same thing though on eBay. I Amazon you can offer your items like you have. No I know I know the difference. I know there's the whole like there's plenty of shit on Amazon that instead of saying sold and shipped by Amazon dot com it says sold and shipped by you know Joe Schmo gaming company or something.
1058000	1072000	But that is that does throw an interesting monkey wrench in the whole thing. It doesn't it doesn't any I said again here's the thing again I don't agree with going after one dude or whatever but Amazon is a store front.
1072000	1082000	The guy is I'm sorry. How should I describe my game. You know I have a copy here. It's brand new in the box and it's still on it and never and sealed.
1082000	1094000	But and I open now I'm the price bought and never opened. I just told you how to describe it by never open. It's fucking stupid. But why over we wouldn't have got sued if he called it bought never open.
1095000	1106000	This is stupid. These. I mean why. Why are you wasting time. I don't disagree that it's stupid but at the same time like it's kind of like one of those like from a legal standpoint I get it.
1106000	1115000	But is it worth it. No that is that is kind of like where my head's at right now. OK well let's just let him get away with it. Like they got away with charging for mods too. Let's never forget.
1116000	1125000	Here's other fucking platform Loki. They're not getting away with it because we're not the only podcast sitting here this week. There's not the only gaming but I understand.
1125000	1135000	Defending them and say well they were within the right. No fuck them. You know what. Fuck them. They're a big fucking company doesn't patch the fucking games. They can just they can fucking.
1135000	1146000	What is OK. What is wrong. Loki was saying though legally I guess. Yeah maybe we should reevaluate that legal situation. Don't we do that a lot here.
1146000	1157000	I know a lot in life in general. OK let's. Wow the laws are critically stupid. Here's hypothetically though let's let's just think about this. So say I am Joe Schmoe who owns a game shop.
1157000	1173000	OK right. And I purchased my copy of the game from a distributor who was purchased it from Bethesda. Right. So technically I could be the first the game shop would be the first owner of it if I would say.
1173000	1183000	So really the game shops give me the first owner and none of them are brand new. You're an authorized retailer. Am I because you know like because you went through an authorized distributor.
1183000	1194000	So you're an authorized retailer. I just explained though that the thingy in the Tomb Raider thing I read did not say needs to go back to GameStop. It said authorized retailer. It doesn't matter.
1194000	1205000	It doesn't matter though. There's no difference between that copy purchase at GameStop purchase from any other game store ever get into law directly. In fact if you ever get called for jury duty you should just say I.
1206000	1216000	I'm going to yell and scream because law is stupid because I'm not law is stupid sometimes Loki. I'm not saying it don't ever get into law.
1216000	1227000	I'm just going to tell you first sale doctor protects this kind of crap because and many have tried to get around the first sale doctrine and I'm sorry it's it's not gonna happen.
1227000	1235000	Disney loves to try to fight this shit and telling you what you can and cannot do with copies that you've purchased you know through retail.
1235000	1242000	So this is yet another company trying to do that. I'm sorry first sale dropped in first sale doctrine bitch. It's always going to fuck your shit up.
1242000	1251000	So you just got to get over your shit and fucking just make better games or something if that's the problem. If we titled our show I would title this one first sale doctrine bitch.
1251000	1257000	I mean like seriously it's stupid. It's absolutely stupid.
1257000	1267000	S.S.G. 100 Matt in chat says over at live dot vog network dot com. I guess I kind of see it like buying selling a car. Someone can't just buy a car from a dealership drive down the street and sell it myself as new.
1267000	1274000	No in fact once you drive a car they always say once you drive the car off the lot it's already lost like 10 percent of its value.
1274000	1284000	Well I drove it on test drives. Technically that's off the lot. So you always want to fight it. Eric gave me that 10 percent discount.
1284000	1289000	You always want to fight the man Loki.
1289000	1298000	All right. Going to chat over at life not fog network dot com. Bobby agrees with me going through an authorized distributor you are an authorized retailer stores that you worked with Loki.
1299000	1311000	They were authorized retailers. GameStop is not an authorized distributor. Why we are in chat says Are you sure you can't try to sell it as new. It doesn't mean someone is going to fall for it.
1311000	1321000	But when the pink slips get exchanged while I are that's when your devious plan is going to go Ari because the person giving it to you on the pink slip is no longer going to be the retailer.
1321000	1330000	That's that's why the DMV tracks all that stuff is who owned the car previously and all that stuff. So honestly just sell it again like on eBay or something. No one's going to pay attention.
1330000	1342000	No there's no lawyers are going to fucking come after you for that shit. I did it all the fucking time. This all tie into why GameStop will not take your games back if they're sealed because I always thought that was more of an issue stolen game.
1342000	1350000	Well yeah that's more of an issue with stolen games which that makes no fucking sense anyways because OK I'm taking the shrink wrap up. OK now I can take it back.
1350000	1363000	Well technically you're going to hate me tonight. I don't care. Technically if the employee sees you do it the employee still has to say I'm sorry that came in here shrink wrapped. I can't take it because the employee saw you doing it.
1364000	1375000	Now if you know that rule and you take the shrink wrap off as you're walking up to the store and throw it in nearby receptacle and the employee doesn't see you doing it then yeah you can sell it as back as pre-owned.
1375000	1386000	And how dumb of a. Don't steal. Number one don't steal games. But number two I mean if you bought it if you really truly bought a game that you never fucking played and you've all done it.
1386000	1394000	You've all you may not have done it with a physical game but open up this little application on your computer called steam. You've all fucking bought a game that you never played OK.
1394000	1401000	So if you've ever done that a game a game at least one singular game. OK.
1401000	1409000	I already know I'm not even going to turn around and look at the chat room because I know there's going to be somebody in there is going to be like well I load all of my games at least once.
1409000	1417000	Anyway I'm just not even going to look fine. You're special. Have a cookie. But for the most part you're all out there. There's people that have bought games they've never fucking played.
1417000	1426000	So if you've ever done it with a physical game and you try to go sell it back like you know you should be able to do that if you realized you made a mistake you have buyer's remorse.
1426000	1434000	You should have the evil within two. I mean come on. We're not talking Skyrim. It's truly or even something that like people want again like no man's sky.
1434000	1439000	Like it's not even a game where it's like suddenly you want this again. You know where it's it's riding a second wave.
1439000	1450000	I'm just mad that someone doesn't want the evil within two and they're just like well it's dumb. It's dumb. It's stupid. They shouldn't get away with it.
1450000	1460000	All right. Going to chat one more comment here. MXC in chat says I'm pretty sure a store near me sells stolen games or something. They sell the games as disc only.
1460000	1472000	Yeah. Well I don't think that necessarily means it's stolen but that is strange. They could be weird flop things that like the manufacturing screwed up the box or something. I mean I don't know it's.
1472000	1480000	Yeah they could be purchasing damaged stuff but yeah admittedly it's a stretch. But well remember when GameStop used to get so much shit because this wasn't that long ago.
1480000	1488000	This is what like four or five years ago when the last copy of the game in the store was just the disc. They would be like this our last copy it's new.
1488000	1498000	I'm going to put you may have noticed that your copy of Until Dawn Rush of Blood was not sealed because that was the last copy.
1499000	1512000	They still do it. They still fucking do it. But they're an authorized reseller. What the fuck. What the fuck people. It's not sealed. How the fuck am I supposed to know that they're not an authorized reseller.
1512000	1529000	Actually says that you fucking lied to me. Actually if they're still checking out game actually where the lawsuits for you know I'm going to I'm going to humor that argument because actually if they're still letting employees check out games and shit then Bethesda should be suing GameStop.
1529000	1540000	They should be because you know why. Because they're just too fucking lazy to make up case art. And well they're saving on costs that way because they don't want to print their own cases.
1540000	1551000	Anyway. All right. Let's move on. I don't know. I don't know if there's anything else we could say on this. All right. One more S.T. 100 Matt in chat says Loki would be the person to buy the car at the dealership.
1551000	1558000	Put an ad on Craigslist for the new car that they have to meet you at that dealership. The car can't depreciate in value if it doesn't drive off the lot.
1558000	1570000	Loki. I can see the meme right now and holding him. Oh the guy with the tap. Can't lose value if you don't drive it off the line. There you go. All right. Anyway let's move on.
1570000	1583000	That's that's one of many news stories we get to cover tonight. No this is the problem with Jamie not being here is that there's no one to keep the peace. But at the same time what is Jamie ever been the one to keep the peace.
1583000	1594000	I just feel like the balance is off. That's all. Loki and I are meant to fight for the next several months. All right. Anyway let's get into our gaming weeks. Let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1594000	1608000	Loki you've been playing some games. So I did play a couple of games. So I did actually get to play Horizon Zero Dawn finally. So that was pretty cool. And it looks gorgeous. And I played a few hours of that. I kind of dig it.
1608000	1625000	I've already had the ending ruined for me sort of I kind of forgot a lot of that. So I'm just going to pretend that I don't know the twist but it is enjoyable. It's enjoyable game. I'm playing it on the easiest difficulty ever because I just don't want to give an effort to its story difficulty so you can focus on the story.
1625000	1649000	It's still pretty difficult. So there's nothing wrong with playing a game on Ultra hard you know. And then Bobby Black Wolf flopped the game so you could have an easy mode. So use it. Exactly. All right. And then I loaded up the Java version of Minecraft because now having loaded on my son's laptop I realized that they have better controller support and stuff now.
1650000	1665000	And it seems like it's a lot easier to do the mods and everything now. So I've been messing with that and I put the Pokemon mod on there and that's interesting walking around the game and having Pokemon everywhere that you can catch and stuff. Cute. It's neat.
1666000	1679000	It'd be cool to do like a server like that. I don't know how to run that but it can be done. It's just can you run modded stuff with realms or not through realms realms is just through like the console.
1680000	1682000	We said like months ago we were into a VOD.
1683000	1693000	But like the console Minecraft is its own thing. So that's all the ones that are on everything. Not anymore. The piece is a PC connected to tablet connected to Nintendo. That's the Windows 10 version.
1694000	1702000	OK. So the Windows 10 version is connected to all of those cross platform things. I'm talking about the Java version. Oh sorry.
1702000	1716000	Old Minecraft. You're right. You're right. Yeah. So yeah. Old Minecraft. You can do all that fun stuff with Forge and everything. So I was trying that out. I couldn't get any of the shaders to run which is weird because I have like a GTX 1060 in there.
1716000	1726000	So whatever happened to 4K graphics in Minecraft. They still have that E3 2017. They tease that. And I know y'all are laughing. Ha ha. Minecraft in 4K.
1726000	1737000	But seriously check out the screenshots like it look gorgeous because sure it still has that old like you know retro look to it but like the water was really like the sunsets and the environment.
1737000	1745000	Yeah. Look at like Sonic ether's unbelievable shaders or something like that. They can. It looks really nice and you can do like higher res textures and everything like that.
1745000	1758000	Just yeah I wasn't able to get to work on my version of Minecraft I had. So I'm still trying to figure that out. But whatever. I mean it looks all right and runs good.
1758000	1773000	And then I see what else they play. That's about it. I didn't really work a whole lot this week on on programming stuff. I mean I sort of did. I kind of was gathering information and everything.
1773000	1785000	I'm trying to basically build what I had started building in unity for one of my game projects in unreal now. So I was kind of trying to see if there's better ways to do everything.
1785000	1797000	So that's what I was doing this week. And then I picked up a surface pro 3. So I've been doing that. That's going to be exclusively for art work and stuff so I can actually draw my own artwork easily.
1798000	1814000	So I'm looking forward to messing with that. All right. My gaming week pretty dull mostly because I was gone most of the weekend. So it's kind of a repetition of a lot of my old go tos Final Fantasy 14 was a big chunk of that because they got a minor update this week.
1814000	1824000	But it added this new thing called Eureka pagos to it for those of you that play the game. So I've grinded enough of Eureka animals where I could go into the new one the pagos.
1824000	1837000	So I was checking that out a little bit but it's because it is so new like there's a lot of stuff people are still trying to figure out with it. So it's probably going to take a couple weeks before people because you know there's crazies out there that will grind max level as fast as they can.
1837000	1849000	And then you know kind of help people figure things out. So it's still in kind of a discovery mode. So I've been playing more of the first Eureka to still try to level up to the absolute cap that you can get to.
1850000	1858000	Because it's interesting Eureka is like a separate leveling system than the rest of the game. But Eureka is also meant to be a little bit more of a throwback to Final Fantasy 11.
1858000	1867000	Because like it's all about getting parties together to chain XP mobs and get XP that way. And if you die you level down just like in Final Fantasy 11.
1867000	1875000	So unless you get resurrected which is actually a pretty easy thing to get. So but yeah if you if you're too lazy and you'll get resurrected you actually lose XP like you did in 11.
1875000	1884000	But it doesn't affect the main game at all. It's all like a side thing that you do. That's where they put the new relics. So if you want to get your relic weapon it's all in there.
1884000	1893000	So I've been playing a bit of that in Final Fantasy 14 and then continuing Heroes of the Storm. I've been playing two or three games of that like every day just to make sure I get my quest done.
1893000	1902000	And you might be wondering like which character do I play? Which character do I like to play? I really kind of float around everybody because I'm always trying to finish my quests.
1902000	1914000	But lately I've really taken a liking to Hanzo which is weird because I can't stand him in Overwatch. But like in Heroes of the Storm I really love some of the builds he can do because he's so good at what they call wave clear.
1914000	1923000	So like you know how like in lane games there's like minions that will like you know crawl across the map. So like Hanzo has this thing where he can like insta kill minions if you build his thing a certain way.
1923000	1933000	So it feels like really rewarding to kind of like if you're the only one on a lane which sometimes happens to like just insta kill all the minions and then it's really easy to kind of push the towers that way.
1933000	1943000	So yeah I don't know like I really like playing Hanzo in that game. So yeah except he's so he's so weak. Like if somebody decides to target him they can shred him so fast.
1943000	1951000	So that's the thing with Hanzo. But he can run over walls. That's the other thing. So like if you get in a bad situation you just run over walls and try to get out of it.
1951000	1959000	So anyway. That's been pretty much my game a week otherwise. So no real announcements to tell you guys about.
1959000	1966000	I already talked about Dragon Con stuff last week so I won't repeat myself except that we will not be here Labor Day weekend as I will be at Dragon Con in Atlanta.
1966000	1975000	And if you're planning to be at Dragon Con I really do hope to see you there. I will have several panels where you can come say hello. I will publish a full schedule shortly.
1975000	1983000	Actually it will be in the app which is expected to be updated around the 20th. So about 10 well actually yeah about 10 days for the Con 9 days for the Con.
1983000	1991000	So the app will be fully updated and you can actually go and when you go into the guests attending professionals you can actually find Rob Roberts and you'll be able to see my whole schedule right there in the app.
1992000	2000000	The funny thing is and I did this last year which was my first year as an attending professional because you make your own schedule in the app.
2000000	2010000	So the first thing I'll do is I'll look up myself and favorite all my own stuff to make sure that my schedule is there first.
2010000	2014000	And then the other stuff that I want to see I add to it because it will tell me if there's any conflicts.
2014000	2018000	Like last year there was something I wanted to see and I couldn't go because I had a panel at the same time. It's like whoop conflict.
2018000	2025000	That's the only bummer about Dragon Con. Too much going on that's sometimes scheduled at the same time.
2025000	2034000	So anyway yes Bobby I will favorite yours next. The sad thing is Bobby there's and you already know this there's stuff that we have at the exact same time.
2034000	2042000	In fact I believe the very first panel time slot Friday 10 a.m. well unless you count Thursdays because Thursday is the new Friday.
2042000	2050000	But pretty much Friday the very first time slot in the morning like Bobby and I have a conflict. We are next door to each other.
2050000	2058000	He's in like video games B and I'm in video games A. We have like panels and we are both moderating said panels.
2058000	2068000	So literally competing against each other. But I have the Mass Effect actors. He has cell phone game development if I remember the timing right.
2068000	2077000	I think we know who's going to win that. Well here's the thing. Maybe in popularity yes. However like yes I'm yes I will win that contest in popularity.
2077000	2084000	But that's not really about that because if I'm a developer sometimes it's not about like that it's about what are you going to get out of a panel.
2084000	2088000	If I'm a developer you're going to get more out of Bobby's panel than you will out of mine with the Mass Effect.
2088000	2094000	But if you're a fanboy you're going to get more out of mine. Well I would go to Bobby's panel anyways because I don't really care for Mass Effect.
2094000	2104000	See there you go. And that's totally fine. Both panels will be great. All right. Anyway. All right.
2104000	2113000	SSG100 Matt in chat says one of you should pull a Carson and storm the others panel. You know it is what is interesting is it is the first year that Bobby and I are kind of do it.
2113000	2123000	So honestly I could go over there and say I'm Bobby Black Wolf and he could go over there and say he's Rob Roberts. I don't think anyone would ever know.
2123000	2132000	They would when they start asking development questions and I just feel that's a good question. What do you think. I wish I knew that.
2132000	2138000	Well just have you tried turning up the graphics on level three.
2138000	2144000	Every time your development on and then back or off. Have you tried turning it off and then on again.
2145000	2156000	No I'm not. I'm not going to do that to the poor developers out there that really want to learn something from the talented people behind Simpsons tapped out that cell phone game is is nuts.
2156000	2164000	There's I know people that play that game that would even consider themselves gamers but it's like dude you're obsessed with Simpsons tapped out like you're a gamer.
2164000	2172000	So anyway moving on let's get into some news stories and stop talking about dueling panels Loki once you start us off with some news tonight.
2172000	2176000	OK so there's lots of different Diablo games in the works.
2176000	2192000	This is Blizzard. Apparently they put out a short video with the community manager Brandy Kamel and promised that there is going to be that they're not ignoring the Diablo fans that they have multiple projects in the works.
2192000	2197000	Some of them are going to take longer than others but we may have some things to show you later this year.
2198000	2209000	Yeah hit hit Blizzcon later this year get those pre-orders or do they sell tickets for that or there is I think a third wave coming a surprise third wave of tickets coming up shortly.
2209000	2221000	But the main waves have all sold out and I would imagine this third wave is probably like rejected cards and possible spam bought things that have been caught for the first two waves being real.
2221000	2227000	So I would imagine this third wave is going to be very small. So well pre-order that pay-per-view.
2227000	2230000	Yeah right. Yeah they have the good old pay-per-view I guess so.
2230000	2238000	Yeah man I do wish I was going to Diablo this year or Blizzcon this year because Diablo is my favorite of all the franchises that Blizzard does.
2238000	2240000	Apparently you're a gamer was saying that.
2240000	2242000	Have you heard some of the rumors.
2242000	2245000	Yeah they reported that Diablo 3 is coming to the switch.
2245000	2254000	And that one's been out there for a while. I think that would be a good thing to drop at Blizzcon for the holidays is that Diablo 3 is coming out on switch.
2254000	2266000	I mean but there's also that part of me that's like okay but like I've I've literally played through Diablo 3 like hundreds of times like there's there's only so much more I can give to that game.
2266000	2276000	If they're going to sweeten the pot by putting some new stuff in Diablo 3 like a proper expansion but I'm not going to hold my breath because I kind of think they're working on Diablo 4.
2276000	2279000	I think we're far enough out now where we can start saying the number 4.
2279000	2288000	But the other rumor that's out there is that they are going to remaster Diablo 2 just like they did with Starcraft not that long ago.
2288000	2289000	Maybe.
2289000	2303000	Because you know people still love Starcraft and there's still people that swear by Diablo 2 as the Diablo which I totally get because there was a lot that changed between Diablo 2 and 3 especially when it comes to like classes and just the way the game played.
2303000	2312000	So there's people that are still loyal to Diablo 2 so to remake Diablo 2 with just HD graphics I think there'd be a huge interest for that.
2312000	2316000	So I wouldn't be surprised at all for that to be a big reveal as well.
2316000	2322000	So those might be like they're sooner than others they're going to announce you know Diablo 3 on Switch and Diablo 2 remaster.
2322000	2328000	And maybe you know again I'm fan wanking get the tarp because I'm fan wanking.
2328000	2337000	Maybe the way they're going to sweeten the pot with Diablo 3 on the Switch is to include the Diablo 2 remaster on the Switch with it. Wouldn't that be something?
2337000	2339000	I don't know if that...
2339000	2341000	I warned you it was fan wank.
2341000	2348000	Alright so anyway but those would probably be the sooner things than like Diablo 4 would be the way out thing.
2348000	2360000	But I'm expecting it to be a very Diablo year at Blizzcon because I mean Overwatch like they might unveil a new character but like Overwatch I don't see them suddenly going we're going to make Overwatch 2.
2360000	2370000	Like Overwatch League is still kind of like you know Overwatch League we know is going to grow next year and you know I feel like it's still kind of like they don't need to do a lot of it.
2370000	2379000	I would still love for them to announce we're making like some PvE dedicated stuff that's not part of an event that like there's going to be some year round PvE in the game.
2379000	2389000	I still would love to see that but I'm not holding my breath on that. I feel like Overwatch is still enough of an attraction that people want to check it out.
2389000	2394000	World of Warcraft they've got an expansion coming out next week believe it or not.
2394000	2400000	So they're not exactly going to announce a new expansion at Blizzcon.
2400000	2401000	Starcraft?
2401000	2403000	They may announce a new patch.
2403000	2406000	So yeah that leaves Starcraft and Heroes of the Storm.
2406000	2411000	Well Heroes of the Storm like Overwatch you're not going to they're just going to keep adding to it.
2411000	2414000	So they're going to be like we have a new battleground some new heroes that's what they'll do with Heroes of the Storm.
2414000	2423000	So yeah either they're going to unveil something their big unveil has got to be either Starcraft which would mean like a Starcraft 3 or another Starcraft 2 expansion.
2423000	2428000	I just I just don't think now's the time for Starcraft I think now's the time for Diablo I really do.
2428000	2436000	Because Starcraft just got that remaster last year that was kind of the big thing so I just it's Diablo's time to shine.
2436000	2439000	You'll really do a new game?
2439000	2449000	They could Blizzard could have I mean and then of course I'm neglecting Hearthstone but again Hearthstone is also just an evergreen type of game where they'll say oh we've got another card expansion coming.
2449000	2459000	Sure Blizzard could always announce a new game why not the last the only time I went to Blizzcon was the year they announced Overwatch and it was a big fucking deal like Overwatch was a very new type of thing for Blizzard.
2459000	2465000	So I'm sure Blizzard's working on a whole new idea out there somewhere but you know we'll see.
2465000	2468000	I don't know if this is the year for that either.
2469000	2477000	Over in chat at live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwool says it's rock and roll racing's time to shine bring back rock and roll racing.
2477000	2483000	You know what rock and roll racing would actually make an amazing map in Heroes of the Storm.
2483000	2497000	So I'm kind of surprised that that isn't something that they're trying to trying to do is like a racing map or like as part of the like the lanes or tracks and then like you could like unveil like as part of like the the mini objectives like cars that would like drive over your enemies and stuff and knock them back.
2497000	2500000	That would be really funny but anyway who knows.
2500000	2504000	ActDeft in chat says I still want Overwatch on Switch.
2504000	2509000	Never say never I mean that could be could be a thing could happen.
2509000	2510000	Alright.
2510000	2516000	Kaijuto in chat says in the era of microtransaction I'm not happy about a Diablo 2 remake.
2516000	2531000	Well for what it's worth Kaijuto when they did the Starcraft remake it was just like they didn't inject DLC into it and they didn't inject like other stuff it was like pay $19.99 and get original Starcraft just as it was but with HD graphics.
2531000	2545000	So I have a feeling if they do a Diablo 2 remaster it's not going to be like it's going to be like if you want to play Diablo 2 with pretty graphics or whatever it's 20 bucks or 30 bucks whatever they end up charging for I don't think they'll suddenly be like and we're putting treasure boxes in it.
2545000	2546000	I don't think they'll do that.
2546000	2547000	No.
2547000	2548000	I don't think they will.
2548000	2549000	Alright.
2549000	2554000	Anyhow let's talk about the Smash Brothers Direct that happened this week.
2554000	2555000	Did you watch the Smash Brothers Direct?
2555000	2556000	I did.
2556000	2557000	I didn't.
2557000	2570000	I have to admit I'm only mentioning this based on what I've read around the internet and I did I did watch one reveal trailer because I am very excited about Simon Belmont coming to Super Smash Ultimate.
2570000	2584000	And I realize he's been rumored for a long time but it was it still was something to see that whole unveil trailer with not just death killing Luigi but like all of the all of the bosses were in that little reveal trailer that was pretty badass.
2584000	2585000	Yeah that's all part of that one level too.
2585000	2597000	I'm like I never realized I want Nintendo to make a new Castlevania game or I guess maybe if they're having Nanko Bandai's help or whatever but like I'm like damn like they they make Castlevania look real good.
2598000	2605000	So yes Simon Belmont is coming to Super Smash Ultimate and since they're doing this whole shadow characters is that what they're called shadow characters?
2605000	2606000	Echo Fighters.
2606000	2607000	Echo Fighters.
2607000	2608000	Excuse me.
2608000	2612000	Um padding roster is what they roster padding.
2612000	2613000	They're fucking allowed Loki.
2613000	2614000	They're fucking allowed.
2614000	2620000	Honestly after some of the stuff that Sakurai has delivered with this they're fucking allowed to do like elaborate pallet swaps that they want.
2620000	2621000	I'm totally okay with it.
2621000	2629000	So yes they're doing Echo Fighter for Richter Belmont in addition to Simon Belmont which I think is badass.
2629000	2630000	I think I kind of like Richter.
2630000	2631000	No Alucard.
2631000	2633000	I mean I just careful what you wish for.
2633000	2634000	You never know.
2634000	2635000	So you don't know what's there.
2635000	2637000	That was not the only character they unveiled.
2637000	2639000	They also unveiled King K. Rool.
2639000	2642000	King K. Rool if you if you will.
2642000	2644000	The antagonist in the Donkey Kong series.
2644000	2650000	Well the modern Donkey Kong series not the old ones obviously because the antagonist in the old Donkey Kong game was Mario.
2650000	2651000	Ha ha.
2651000	2652000	Plot twist.
2652000	2653000	But anyway King K. Rool.
2653000	2654000	I think.
2654000	2656000	And more fucking Fire Emblem characters.
2656000	2657000	Hooray.
2657000	2659000	Which are also Echo Fighters right?
2659000	2660000	Yeah.
2660000	2666000	King K. Rool is honestly I'm not that excited about that unveil.
2666000	2669000	Like send your hate mail right on in.
2669000	2670000	I don't care.
2670000	2671000	All the dudes from Contra.
2671000	2673000	Contra dudes.
2673000	2675000	But I'm not that excited.
2675000	2676000	I mean here's the thing though.
2676000	2679000	I'm not shitting on Smash Brothers Ultimate by any means.
2679000	2681000	This game is going to be fucking fantastic.
2681000	2683000	And with the roster as big as it is.
2683000	2685000	Echo Fighters or not.
2685000	2688000	They're allowed to have one or two characters that I'm going to go.
2688000	2689000	You know what?
2689000	2690000	I'm just not going to play that character.
2690000	2694000	I can't wait for the very last director they're going to have at Smash when they announce Waluigi.
2694000	2695000	Because they're going to save that.
2695000	2696000	For the end.
2696000	2697000	Y'all need to let it go.
2697000	2699000	Waluigi is not going to be in the fucking game.
2699000	2700000	And you need to just.
2700000	2702000	Well he's going to be an assist and that's it.
2702000	2705000	And y'all need to let Sakurai get his fucking sleep.
2705000	2708000	And never ask him for anything ever again.
2708000	2709000	It's coming.
2709000	2710000	It'll be the last one.
2710000	2711000	The very last one.
2711000	2712000	No.
2712000	2713000	No.
2713000	2714000	Because this is the thing.
2714000	2719000	Waluigi does not need his redemption as much as.
2719000	2720000	Wart.
2720000	2722000	The antagonist in Mario Brothers 2.
2722000	2723000	I agree.
2723000	2724000	He's disappeared ever since.
2724000	2728000	Or half of the other Mario Brothers 2 characters.
2728000	2732000	Honestly, Wart would make me so fucking happy.
2732000	2733000	I would cry.
2733000	2734000	What about Birdo?
2734000	2735000	I'll take it.
2735000	2736000	I'll take Birdo.
2737000	2738000	But Wart is really like.
2738000	2740000	Wart is my like A tier wish list.
2740000	2742000	Birdo's like B tier.
2742000	2746000	Birdo could be like an echo fighter for like Yoshi or something.
2746000	2747000	Going to chat.
2747000	2748000	Bobby Blackwolf said.
2748000	2753000	Luigi died and will be replaced by Waluigi.
2753000	2755000	Well technically Mario died too.
2755000	2758000	So there's a lot of death in there.
2758000	2759000	Let's see.
2759000	2760000	SHO 100 Matt points out.
2760000	2762000	Wart and Mouser were a dream.
2762000	2764000	You know what?
2764000	2766000	Some dreams are real.
2766000	2769000	Dreams are a reflection of reality.
2769000	2770000	Are they not?
2770000	2771000	Anyway.
2771000	2773000	I just think they need to go obscure.
2773000	2775000	Captain Rainbow.
2775000	2777000	Let's put Tingle in there.
2777000	2778000	Fuck yeah.
2778000	2779000	Let's put Tingle.
2779000	2780000	He has an actual fighter.
2780000	2781000	Fuck this assist shit.
2781000	2782000	Do you know what's funny though?
2782000	2786000	Since I talk about like people need to fucking leave Sakurai alone and all this stuff.
2786000	2788000	Did you know he actually went to Twitter this week?
2788000	2791000	And a translated version of the tweet reads like this.
2791000	2794000	Again, I'll do my best for the presentation tomorrow.
2794000	2797000	It'll start at a relatively convenient time in Japan.
2797000	2798000	So please watch it.
2798000	2800000	My eyes might be a little red.
2800000	2802000	That's because they're a little tired.
2802000	2807000	Because people are kind of noticing that Sakurai looks like he's fucking been through it.
2807000	2810000	Like he looks like he has been through it.
2810000	2815000	So that's why I'm saying you Waluigi fucks need to leave him alone.
2815000	2818000	Leave Sakurai alone!
2819000	2824000	He's created the greatest, one of the greatest video games of all time.
2824000	2826000	Leave him alone!
2828000	2832000	That was my attempt to mimic leave Britney alone to make success.
2832000	2834000	Anyway.
2835000	2841000	And you know, keep in mind during all of this, like this game is in crunch time right now.
2841000	2843000	So this is like, and this game is already announced.
2843000	2845000	Like it is happening for the holidays.
2845000	2847000	It is not getting pushed back.
2847000	2850000	So you know what, Sakurai is probably having a rough life right now.
2850000	2857000	I just hope, you know what, when he has finished the game and he's released it and it sold 11 billion copies,
2857000	2859000	I hope he gets a fucking vacation.
2859000	2862000	You know what, he can do what Barack Obama's done.
2862000	2866000	He can fucking take a vacation and not look back on this shithole of a country.
2866000	2872000	That's what he can do when he's earned his due.
2872000	2874000	He can just take a vacation and never come back.
2874000	2876000	He's earned it.
2877000	2879000	I'm not saying he should never develop again.
2879000	2881000	No, I love him and he should.
2881000	2887000	But if he wants to take a nice long vacation for like two years, he is allowed.
2887000	2895000	SSG100Matt says he wanted a vacation after Smash 4, but Nintendo wouldn't let him.
2895000	2899000	Well that's why I'm saying Nintendo, give the man a fucking break.
2899000	2903000	Anyway, let's move on. More news, Loki.
2904000	2909000	So Nintendo, speaking of, well, I don't know if they're not necessarily giving people a break,
2909000	2915000	but they have that whole lawsuit against Love Roms for of course storing ROMs of their games on there
2915000	2918000	and they've taken them to court for that.
2918000	2925000	So kind of spooked by that, MU Paradise is actually announcing that they have,
2925000	2929000	based on the recent legal action of other ROM sites,
2929000	2936000	they'll be changing and ceasing to offer ROM versions of Nintendo's and other companies' older games.
2936000	2941000	It's not worth it for us to risk potentially disastrous consequences.
2941000	2947000	I cannot in good conscience risk the future of our team members who have contributed to the site throughout the years.
2947000	2954000	We run MU Paradise for the love of retro games and for you to be able to revisit those good times.
2954000	2960000	Unfortunately, it's not possible right now to do so in a way that makes everyone happy and keeps us out of trouble.
2962000	2968000	So they've decided to make a new start. We will continue to be passionate retro gamers
2968000	2971000	and we'll continue doing cool stuff around retro games.
2971000	2977000	But you won't be able to get your games from here for now.
2977000	2980000	Where we go with this is up to you.
2981000	2987000	Well, what can you say? I mean, the games will be elsewhere. They will always be elsewhere.
2987000	2990000	This is the internet. One site goes down, another one goes up.
2990000	2996000	So I think as far as the website MU Paradise is concerned, now it's kind of a test of the community over there.
2996000	3002000	Without the ROMs, are they still going to have the community to keep that site?
3002000	3006000	They're never going to stop ROMs from being on the internet. They're everywhere.
3006000	3011000	All it's going to do if they really start hammering down on these ROM sites is just going to push it more underground.
3011000	3014000	You know, we were talking a little bit about this at the end of Bobby's show this week.
3014000	3023000	I don't want to repeat myself too much, but as much as I respect Nintendo's right to protect these games that they made in the 80s.
3023000	3029000	You know what? You can't pirate Disney movies that were made in the 60s and the 50s as much as you want to.
3029000	3031000	You can't just pirate and copy those movies.
3031000	3036000	So if Nintendo wants to enforce the trademark on their games, they have that right whether you like it or not.
3036000	3045000	But I also think you don't want to take ROMs away completely because there is a lot that can be learned about game development from them.
3045000	3050000	There's a lot that can be unveiled about games that never existed in the first place.
3050000	3054000	And what we've learned from the failures of that.
3054000	3062000	And there are some developers that have made arcade games that were emulated in MAME.
3062000	3070000	And the guys that made the original arcade games released their source public domain to be like,
3070000	3076000	Sure, emulate all you want. Learn from what we developed. Learn how we made the games. Use this to learn.
3076000	3081000	So I think I would never want to see emulation go away completely.
3081000	3088000	Absolutely not because I think there's so much to learn from those that are fine with their stuff being released to the public.
3088000	3090000	Once again though, I don't even know.
3090000	3093000	Robbie Roto or whatever that game is that was released not that long ago.
3093000	3095000	Well, it was probably like five years ago at this point.
3095000	3100000	I understand that they would have to enforce their copyrights or they lose it.
3100000	3106000	But at the same time, I don't think that pirating ROMs is necessarily...
3106000	3113000	Well, first off, I mean, like if you own copies of the games and you're just getting a ROM dump of it,
3113000	3115000	I don't see the problem there in the first place.
3115000	3120000	And second off, is it really affecting the sales of these things?
3120000	3125000	I've downloaded full ROM sets of the NES library and Super NES library like dozens of times.
3125000	3130000	I still bought those ROMs. Like I bought them originally when they were out in the NES.
3130000	3133000	I bought them on the Super NES. I bought them on the Wii.
3133000	3138000	I bought them on the 3DS when I had it. I bought them on the Wii U.
3138000	3144000	I bought the Super NES Classic, so it's not affecting my purchasing of their stuff.
3144000	3146000	Believe it or not, I'm like right with you there.
3146000	3149000	Of course I've downloaded a shit ton of ROMs in my day,
3149000	3158000	but I still support way more than I'd like to admit of the Virtual Console stuff that Nintendo and likewise put out.
3158000	3165000	Even like the Sega Genesis collection. How many times have I bought the Sega Genesis collection on different systems?
3165000	3168000	Like PC, Playstation 3, Playstation 4? Like a lot, okay?
3168000	3174000	And I'm even still eyeing like, do I want one of those Sega Genesis plastic consoles that they sell at Target?
3174000	3184000	Same thing with Atari Flashback. You can fit the entire Atari library on an old floppy disk.
3184000	3192000	Like those games are itty bitty. That's part of what's so fucking impressive about how so many of them were programmed is that those games are so small in the data.
3192000	3196000	But anyway, like, you know, the entire Atari 2600 library is not that big.
3196000	3202000	I'm still sitting here going, I kind of want to get an Atari Flashback 8 with all the Activision games on it.
3202000	3207000	Like just because they're that good. And I buy the Atari stuff like, you know, anyway.
3207000	3210000	So I just don't understand like, what is, I mean I get that they're-
3210000	3213000	Emulation is emulation. It's emulating the real thing. It's not the real thing.
3213000	3217000	They weren't coming after these companies like, I mean this stuff has been out there forever.
3217000	3221000	So I don't understand like, why now they decided to like, come after these companies.
3221000	3232000	I mean, my thought is just that like, do you really want to turn people like, against like, not necessarily turning against them because of-
3232000	3237000	But like, when it starts with these emulation sites and then eventually it's going to move to,
3237000	3243000	Oh hey, these are the guys that are actually, you know, getting the archives of the stuff for historical preservation.
3243000	3248000	And now you're going to come after them. Because it's once, it's going to just eventually lead up to that.
3248000	3255000	I hope not. I mean, you know, honestly, I realize that those words aren't going to hold a lot of weight.
3255000	3261000	But I just, I really hope not. Especially, you know, with some of the great things a lot of video game preservationists are trying to do.
3261000	3270000	You know, I would really hope Nintendo would respect that like, what those guys are doing is not about trying to just like, distribute a shit ton of ROMs.
3270000	3275000	And, you know, and whatever, and derail Virtual Console or whatever Nintendo wants to invent in their mind.
3275000	3280000	But there are people that really do want to preserve video game history as an art form.
3280000	3288000	As, you know, there is a film, what is it, the Film Preservation Society or whatever, maybe one of you guys in chat knows the exact name of this.
3288000	3294000	They select like 20 or 25 films a year to be preserved like forever type of thing.
3294000	3301000	Or the way that books get preserved in a library and in like, you know, a national library and so forth.
3301000	3309000	Like, you know, video games are an art form that deserve to have some preservation efforts taken around them because discs rot.
3309000	3317000	Servers go down and they go away forever. But there ought to be a way that, you know, the future can play these games too.
3317000	3323000	Just like, you know, it's funny, Melody and I were talking the other day about, you know, some of the stuff we were, I was, because I was joking.
3323000	3330000	Because when the baby was trying to grab my finger, I started to get an Xbox controller and I was like, here, you should start learning on this.
3330000	3334000	And Melody says, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we're going to make her play 8-bit games first.
3334000	3339000	Then she's going to play 16-bit and we're going to, and I've heard a lot of new parents say this type of thing.
3339000	3343000	Like, we're going to work them through the generations just like we did it.
3343000	3350000	But it's like, whoa, what if, what if the 8-bit games, the 16-bit games aren't there to do that with?
3350000	3355000	I mean, sure, Super Mario Brothers will probably always be released on every Nintendo system ever.
3355000	3358000	But what about the Guardian Legend?
3358000	3366000	I consider the Guardian Legend to be an 8-bit classic that I fucking grew up on that, like, makes me part of, like, the gamer fan that I am today.
3366000	3373000	That game has never been available on Virtual Console, any type of legal collection.
3373000	3377000	If it were not for emulation, I couldn't play the Guardian Legend.
3377000	3381000	You couldn't play the Guardian Legend to see what is it that Rob loves so much about this fucking game.
3381000	3383000	I bought you a copy of the Guardian Legend.
3383000	3388000	Yeah, I actually have the Guardian Legend, like, three different times on cartridge, but I'm okay with that.
3388000	3390000	I am totally okay with that. You know what I mean?
3390000	3399000	It's like, you know, if I don't have a working Nintendo and a cartridge like that, there is no other legal way for me to play it.
3399000	3401000	And I don't want that game to go away.
3401000	3411000	And there's going to be some games that just fall in this weird fucking tricky legal void because one company swallowed another company, swallowed another company, where if it wasn't for emulation, it wouldn't be able to do this.
3412000	3417000	So, anyway, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
3417000	3422000	SSJ100Matt says, Sounds like this baby is going to be a future OLR co-host in 18 years.
3422000	3427000	Well, you know, that's the plan, is to hand it off to Josh and Julian in the future.
3427000	3433000	And then possibly other new kids as well.
3433000	3437000	That way it will always keep the crown of longest running gaming podcasts.
3437000	3445000	How have you done a gaming podcast for 100 years? Well, it all started many years ago.
3445000	3451000	Anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about some changes with Twitch.
3451000	3453000	Let's talk about newer things, very new things.
3453000	3457000	Another way we kind of preserve games through video and broadcasting.
3457000	3460000	So, Twitch is going to be making some big changes.
3460000	3464000	When I saw the headline, I actually got the email about this, as did many of you Twitch users.
3464000	3469000	And when I first saw that the email said, we're getting rid of communities, I was a little bit sad.
3469000	3477000	Because I actually really like the communities for discoverability, especially being part of the LGBT family on Twitch.
3477000	3485000	I am always using LGBT to find, you know, other streamers on Twitch that are in that family as well.
3485000	3488000	So, when I first read this, I was like, this is really sad.
3488000	3492000	But I also realized that most of the communities, I'm using my quoting fingers.
3492000	3495000	Most of the communities on Twitch are named after games.
3495000	3505000	And it's like, you shouldn't need a community for Super Smash Brothers because you put that you're streaming Super Smash Brothers and people will find it.
3505000	3508000	You don't need communities based on games, you know what I mean?
3508000	3513000	So, I guess to some extent Twitch has kind of realized that this is going on too.
3513000	3514000	So, they're changing it.
3514000	3520000	And I must admit, once I read fully the changes, I'm okay with it.
3521000	3524000	In fact, actually, I do think it's going to be for the better in the long run.
3524000	3528000	So, here's the deal, they're going to have a new tagging system.
3528000	3530000	So, you'll be able to tag your streams.
3530000	3535000	And they, LGBT specifically, they actually called out in the email specifically the LGBT streamers.
3535000	3538000	And they mentioned that that will be a tag.
3538000	3545000	But they're also going to do tags for like, first time playthrough, game development, speed runs, you know, all these like different types of things.
3545000	3552000	And I did appreciate that Twitch was very open to be like, here is a spreadsheet of all of the tags we're going to be introducing.
3552000	3556000	And if you don't think we have something captured here, like let us know, reply to this email.
3556000	3560000	I don't know if this only went to affiliates maybe, but I feel like everybody probably got it.
3560000	3562000	Maybe it was just an affiliate thing.
3562000	3564000	Hopefully it wasn't under NDA.
3564000	3572000	But anyway, I mean, honestly, you know, I think it's great what Twitch is doing to try to proactively get out there and listen to the feedback from the community.
3572000	3576000	There's also going to be more categories that are going to be added to Twitch as well.
3576000	3582000	Things that are going to help make things more specific than just IRL and creative.
3582000	3601000	So, they're going to break these down into art, hobbies and crafts, food and drink, music and performing arts, beauty and body art, science and technology, just chatting, traveling outdoors, sports and fitness, tabletop RPGs, special events, talk shows and podcasts, and ASMR.
3601000	3613000	Which, you know, for those of you that like to have your gaming streams like this, and now I'm going to slowly click the buttons as I play the game.
3619000	3622000	Have you ever tried to get into that? Alan loves that ASMR.
3622000	3629000	I watched one. It was, I think it was a parody, but it was still ASMR. It was like ASMR bank robbery.
3630000	3642000	If that's what you're into, look, Alan like loves that stuff. And I tease him. I'm only teasing because I love and like, honestly, like, I my like nothing for me for ASMR. Nothing is ever going to beat the pickle lady.
3642000	3652000	There's that there's that lady on YouTube. I don't know her name. Maybe somebody who knows it. She's infamous. And she's sitting there and she's got like she shoves this gigantic ass fucking pickle in her mouth and she's just about to choose down.
3652000	3665000	And it's just like all this noise. And I'm like, damn, that's impressive. But I guess some people like just like really sensitive to that type of noise, like it's very relaxing.
3665000	3674000	Just like how some people could like, well, I'm sure there's a lot of people that want to sleep with a white noise machine. Whereas I can't stand those things. But for some people, it really helps them.
3675000	3686000	So, hmm. Anyway, looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, SSJ100Matt says, sounds like NPR just needs some smooth jazz in the back.
3686000	3691000	Let's see. Tigerclaw says, I sleep with a white noise machine, a fan.
3691000	3698000	Raginator says, just watch. The tagging will get abused in ways the Twitch isn't foreseeing. And eventually they'll say, yeah, we didn't see this going to shit in a dumpster fire.
3698000	3704000	Well, Raginator, for what it's worth, you're not going to be able to invent your own tags. You do have to use the tags that are there.
3704000	3712000	And especially with so many affiliates and partners and things, you don't want to get kicked out of those programs by doing something stupid with the tagging program.
3712000	3719000	So, I mean, obviously it's not going to be perfect 100% with the time. There's always going to be some trolls. But I think for the most part, it should be OK.
3719000	3734000	So, anyway. Anyway, Kaijuto in chat says, Twitch blows with these tags. I'd be curious, a more elaborated version of that comment. Like, what do you not like about that? I'd be curious.
3734000	3744000	Because I'm open to it. I realize that communities probably aren't working quite as they were intended. I like them, but it also really annoys me that the Xbox version of Twitch,
3744000	3755000	and I realize Microsoft's got the whole Mixer thing going on, so maybe Twitch isn't as, you know, wanting to get updated on Xbox. But it really annoys me that the community search isn't on the Xbox version of Twitch.
3755000	3770000	And I don't even think it works on the, even the new PlayStation one. I don't think has it. I could be wrong. But I'm kind of annoyed that, so I hope if they do bring the tagging, that they will update the viewer on all these different, you know, systems they have them on to support the tags as well.
3771000	3776000	That would be, that would be wonderful. Alright, a few more stories before we get to the classic game of the week. Loki?
3777000	3802000	Alright, so this is something that's been going on this week. There was this review by a now former IGN editor by the name of Felipe Musen, and he was fired because apparently it was thought that he plagiarized his review from a YouTube channel.
3802000	3812000	So he had a, there was a YouTuber by the name of Boomstick Gaming that did a review for Dead Cells, and it came out several days earlier.
3812000	3826000	And then he released his review on IGN, and then of course Boomstick Gaming kind of noticed that, and they put out a video comparing the two saying, hey, he plagiarized my review.
3826000	3842000	And so then IGN reviewed it, and they took down the review and basically fired him because they thought I guess as well that he did, you know, I guess enough of the review was taken from the other one.
3843000	3861000	Then on top of that though, so after that whole drama happens, there's other articles coming out, people start looking at his other reviews, and apparently his FIFA 18 review is also very similar to, the FIFA 18 Switch review is very similar to what was on Nintendo Life.
3861000	3869000	And also apparently he had done this maybe with even some other reviews for other games.
3869000	3880000	But he had come out on his YouTube channel and basically said, you know, the bottom line is that what happened with Dead Cells reviews was not at all intentional.
3881000	3893000	So with all that said, I just want to apologize to everybody at IGN for the undeserved criticisms and doubts that many may have sparked in their credibility as a respected source for games media.
3893000	3906000	Basically saying, you know, yeah, it was just a coincidence that I happened to use a similar phrasing to these other channels and stuff, but it's just a little too close to what it was.
3906000	3917000	So he sort of admitted that there's a problem and then said, but it wasn't a problem. I really feel like there's a complete contradiction even within this YouTube thing.
3917000	3933000	And then apparently there's also a third review that he had done as well, and Gadget had posted a review of Metroid Samus Returns last September, and then about five days later he posted his own review of the game, which is also very similar in the wording of that.
3934000	3947000	I don't know if he's just happened to be maybe copying styles of these other reviews or if he's just not playing these games and just reviewing them based on, you know, I don't know.
3949000	3957000	But it's a pattern, and it's not a good pattern. That's not very favorable if you want to get into, you know, the writing industry.
3957000	3968000	Especially when so few opportunities are available, and I can't tell you how many people I know and that I follow online who have this lifelong dream of doing journalism.
3968000	3980000	And journalism right now is really fucking hard because nobody's buying newspapers and magazines. I shouldn't say nobody, but far less than what used to are buying newspapers and magazines anymore.
3980000	3995000	Everybody's going to the internet where everybody ad blocks because, you know, because unfortunately, and I sort of think the ad industry is solely to blame for that, I don't think people would be ad blocking if the ads didn't get ridiculously intrusive.
3995000	4000000	Well, not only ridiculously intrusive, but containing malware and other shit.
4001000	4011000	But anyway, that's a whole nother Oprah. But the reality is because of those reasons, whatever they are, because people have ruined it for everyone else and people are ad blocking, like, you know, there isn't a lot of money to be made there.
4011000	4028000	So it's like it is really fucking hard to be a journalist right now. And those opportunities are few and far between. So to hear that somebody was able to get into IGN only to do this is like, that's kind of a slap in the face to everybody who's working really fucking hard to break into that.
4028000	4057000	And like can't because they just the right opportunity just doesn't fucking come up. And it also goes a long way in saying, you know, I maybe I'm probably gonna regret what I'm about to say, but what it also goes a long way in saying like, what's the difference between these big organizations and the YouTubes that they do, and the podcast that they do, and their fucking opinions, and the independence and our fucking opinions? What's the difference?
4057000	4066000	Well, this should probably demonstrate to you not much, because if this guy did a YouTube thing on Metroid Samus returns, it took this long for him to get fucking caught.
4066000	4071000	Well, yeah, yeah, this thing. Yeah. But he's done this multiple times.
4071000	4078000	So when you come to me and say, well, IGN said this, or, you know, GameSpot said this, that's why sometimes I say, so fucking what?
4078000	4085000	Those reviews, though, weren't necessarily on IGN. So the other two, the FIFA and the other one were on his YouTube channel.
4085000	4098000	Fair enough. So IGN was just the dead cells one. But, you know, it's hard, like YouTube and the Internet is a big place, and it's hard to scrutinize every single review out there.
4098000	4111000	So it's just, you know, in this case, it had to be the reviewer that did the actual review in the first place, noticing that, hey, IGN has a review that sounds just like mine.
4111000	4115000	That's odd. And, you know, pointing it out.
4115000	4121000	MXC in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, I do not believe this person's response to the plagiarism allegations.
4121000	4127000	As someone who writes reviews, I very specifically avoid looking at anyone else's reviews, previews, etc., before writing my own.
4127000	4131000	I don't want to compromise my opinion, etc., or inadvertently use a similar phrase or reference.
4131000	4135000	With that said, it's incredibly clear that this is a case of plagiarism from the writing.
4135000	4140000	He did more work than a typical high school plagiarist, but things are still written in the same order.
4140000	4149000	You know, and I do want to clarify something, because even though I'm saying what's the difference between IGN and GameSpot and all this stuff and us,
4149000	4154000	I do think there are some journalists that are doing a really great job.
4154000	4164000	What can these journalists do that go beyond even maybe what, you know, independents have the time or resources, I suppose, to be able to do?
4164000	4172000	And to give credit where credit is due, and this is really going to surprise some of you guys, but it just goes to show that opinions can change, people can change, places can change.
4172000	4178000	But I was really impressed with Kotaku's reporting on what went on over at Riot Games.
4178000	4182000	And that was a big thing that just came out. Was that this past week, or was that two weeks ago?
4183000	4195000	But that was some impressive fucking six months plus worth of really trying to crack what was a hard nut to crack because they'd scared all these people into not talking.
4195000	4204000	So I do want to give credit where credit is due, even though I'm saying, especially when it comes to opinions, reviews, things like that, what's the difference between them and us, not much.
4204000	4215000	But when you have the resources, when you have the contacts, when you have that time to really try to get into it and get to the core of things, there are several people out there doing some very impressive things.
4215000	4221000	And those are the types of things that journalists can be doing that are really, really good.
4221000	4229000	And I know I have spoken very critically of Kotaku in the past on this show, but that was also many years ago and many things have changed over there since then.
4229000	4240000	So actually, I don't find them nearly as bad as I used to. In fact, I actually kind of like them, especially after things like this last incident with the Riot Games reporting.
4240000	4249000	I thought that was really fucking well done. So anyway, and Dungeon Buster does clarify the Riot Games story was this past week.
4249000	4253000	It didn't make our list for tonight. Well, I guess I ended up bringing it up anyway.
4254000	4263000	Well, tonight's the night where I'm going to say things. I'm going to get in trouble. Ready? So do you want to know what my reaction was when I read that story?
4263000	4268000	I didn't read the story. Have you ever seen Sexism or something in the works?
4268000	4280000	Absolutely. It's bad. It's bad. They really give, from multiple perspectives, documented incidents of how the sexism is kind of rampant in that place.
4280000	4291000	And all I have to say is my reaction was I was really glad I didn't take that job that I was going for in 2012. That's all I'm going to say. Moving on.
4293000	4299000	We got one more story to talk about. All right. Let's talk about Doom Eternal.
4299000	4306000	Doom Eternal is coming to PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and get this Nintendo Switch.
4306000	4308000	Yeah, because they had QuakeCon this week, wasn't it?
4308000	4319000	Bethesda loves Doom Eternal, don't they? Bobby Blackwolf spelling it differently in chat, saying Do-Maternal. Doom Eternal. Sorry if I'm not enunciating correctly for you.
4319000	4327000	But anyway, Doom Eternal was shown off at QuakeCon, and it is going to be confirmed for all the systems, including Switch.
4327000	4332000	Panic Button is doing the Switch port. They did the Doom port, which many people seem to be pretty cool with.
4333000	4341000	So I guess it looks like it's kind of just a sequel to Doom, but it's going to have some new stuff in it. And that would be the 2016 Doom, not the really old ones.
4341000	4349000	There's a new dash movement, there's a blade, a super shotgun, meat hook. There's going to be more demons in Doom Eternal.
4349000	4355000	And you can actually have players that turn into demons in another player's campaign. That's straight out of Dark Souls, isn't it?
4355000	4357000	Yeah, or Demon Souls.
4357000	4366000	And then they were showing some effects where, like, as you blow up the monsters, you can blow them up slowly. Like, little pieces of their flesh fall off the more you attack them and stuff.
4366000	4375000	So, yep, that's a thing that exists in the world. But no, hey, the Doom reboot was great, so I'm pretty excited about the new game.
4376000	4389000	There will be post-launch campaign DLC. SnapMap is not going to be coming back for Doom Eternal. Those were some other little tidbits that were shared at QuakeCon, where id did the big unveil of the game.
4389000	4392000	So, that's Doom. Are you going to check out Doom Eternal?
4392000	4394000	I didn't check out the first one.
4394000	4395000	What?
4395000	4397000	I didn't even check out the first one.
4397000	4407000	You should. It's very fast-paced, but it's very good. Especially now they have it on the Switch. I mean, the Switch, it shows a little bit, but it's not a bad port by any means.
4407000	4409000	I just play it on PC.
4409000	4414000	And honestly, that's nothing against Switch or any of it. It's just keyboard and mouse for me when it comes to those games.
4414000	4418000	And Dungeon Buster in chat agrees. It's good, Loki. Give it a try.
4419000	4432000	Yeah, but you see, I have a library of 560 games in Steam, and, you know, I'm not going to play it. I can buy it, and I won't play it. There was a game I just bought recently.
4432000	4438000	I know there's another big game that I bought recently, and I still haven't played it yet, so I don't even... I can't even remember what it is.
4438000	4440000	Well, I'm happy you just got to Horizon this week.
4440000	4441000	Yes, Horizon.
4441000	4443000	That's one that I still need to play, so...
4443000	4444000	It's great.
4444000	4449000	All right. Well, we're going to go from newer games to some classic games.
4451000	4456000	And thanks to the magic of radio, we're joined right now by the one and only Dark Sakura.
4456000	4457000	Hi.
4457000	4458000	Hi, you're here.
4458000	4459000	Yes.
4459000	4460000	It's magic.
4460000	4461000	You took me on adventures.
4461000	4463000	I know. I'm going to take... Would you like to go on a journey?
4463000	4464000	Magical adventure.
4464000	4469000	It's a magical adventure. Just get in the van that says magic adventure.
4469000	4470000	By the way...
4470000	4471000	Way?
4471000	4476000	We called somebody at work today a unicorn, and I said, you're in danger if Tim Curry comes by in a devil suit.
4478000	4481000	So let's talk about a classic game of the week as old as that reference.
4481000	4482000	Yes.
4482000	4484000	Because every week Dark Sakura jumps into the gaming vault.
4484000	4494000	Whether she's here or not, she will be here through magic to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, brat, play this, or I will...
4494000	4495000	This one's all sticky.
4495000	4498000	I will send Tim Curry to eat you.
4498000	4501000	Don't let kids play arcade games when their hands are chocolaty.
4501000	4503000	What's the classic game of the week, Dark Sakura?
4503000	4505000	Robotron 2084.
4505000	4510000	So, also known as Robotron, because that's what we called it.
4510000	4515000	It is an arcade game that was developed by Eugene Jarvis and Larry DeMar of VidKids.
4515000	4517000	And whoever remembers the numbers anyway.
4517000	4519000	Yes.
4519000	4522000	And it was released by Williams.
4522000	4527000	Of course, you know, there's a lot more Williams things in my house that are pinball, but we'll not go there.
4527000	4530000	It is a 2D shoot-em-up.
4530000	4536000	And basically, in 2084, the robots have taken over in a cybernetic revolt.
4536000	4539000	And you have to defeat the robots, rescue the humans.
4539000	4541000	I look at this as kind of a precursor to Smash TV, to be honest.
4541000	4542000	You know?
4542000	4543000	Yes.
4543000	4545000	Because especially with the whole double joystick thing.
4545000	4546000	Yeah.
4546000	4549000	It is the game that made twin sticks popular.
4549000	4556000	It had previously been used in a game called Mars and in Taito Space Dungeon in 1981.
4556000	4560000	Although, it originated in the game Gun Fight from 1975.
4560000	4562000	But who's played those?
4562000	4566000	I think if I ever did Gun Fight, it would be the second game that came out before I was born.
4566000	4569000	Unless, did Pong came out before? Yeah, Pong came out before I was born, too.
4569000	4571000	Yes, and you did Space War on one episode.
4571000	4573000	The 1950 radar. You did the radar love.
4573000	4575000	You've done some old stuff, Dark Sakura.
4575000	4576000	Yeah.
4576000	4581000	Well, anyway, this game is also listed as one of Jarvis's best contributions to video games.
4581000	4583000	So, it's pretty, pretty notable.
4583000	4586000	So, basically, you have a top-down perspective.
4586000	4590000	You just shoot stuff and try to rescue all the humans.
4590000	4593000	You have different waves of robots and different obstacles that are in there.
4593000	4596000	And you basically just have to survive.
4596000	4602000	And this is also, this particular game, it did feature mono sound.
4602000	4604000	And it's a raster game.
4604000	4607000	So, this was, like, right around the era that they were doing all the vector stuff.
4607000	4610000	And it looks fairly vector, but it really is a raster game.
4610000	4613000	It was on a 19-inch CRT.
4613000	4619000	It used a Motorola 6809 central processing unit that operated at one whole megahertz.
4619000	4620000	Wow.
4620000	4621000	Right?
4621000	4626000	And it actually had this neat thing where it used, like, this scheming programming
4626000	4630000	to generate sounds in order of importance so that it would sound like it was a multi-audio channel
4630000	4632000	when really it was monaural.
4633000	4640000	It also had a custom graphics coprocessor that basically generated the on-screen objects
4640000	4643000	and visual effects independently of the rest of it.
4643000	4647000	And it could also transfer memory space so that the game would stay fast
4647000	4650000	and animate a large number of things at one time.
4650000	4652000	So, this game actually is fairly innovative for its time.
4652000	4657000	And some of these later stages got crazy amounts of stuff going on.
4657000	4660000	So, this game took six months to develop.
4660000	4661000	Just six months.
4661000	4667000	And VidKids was actually a consulting firm that designed games for Williams.
4667000	4671000	And Jarvis and DeMar did work for Williams before.
4671000	4678000	So, the game was meant to be exciting, like an athletic experience that had a physical element with the twin sticks.
4678000	4686000	And then it was basically meant to give a conflicting goal to avoid attacks,
4686000	4691000	to defeat the enemies, and to save a family to earn your points.
4691000	4693000	So, it really was these contrasting things.
4693000	4698000	It was also inspired by the Stern game, Berserk.
4700000	4703000	And also a game for the Commodore PET called Chase.
4703000	4706000	So, and I'm sure that I don't need to go into those games.
4706000	4707000	We pretty much know what they are.
4707000	4711000	And the dual joystick design was developed by Mr. Jarvis there,
4711000	4716000	who was inspired by an automobile accident and playing Berserk.
4716000	4722000	He had injured his right hand, so he couldn't play the game to test it.
4722000	4724000	So, he had to be able to use his left hand as well.
4724000	4725000	So, that's where the joysticks came from.
4725000	4732000	He also created a second type of game like this to aim projectiles and things.
4732000	4739000	And so, he created a prototype using a Stargate arcade system board and two Atari 2600 controllers.
4740000	4744000	So, it basically led to the game we have here.
4744000	4751000	Other things about the game, as far as its story, it was inspired by 1984, the story by George Orwell.
4751000	4756000	Although this, of course, game did predate Terminator.
4756000	4760000	So, who knows, maybe Terminator was inspired by this.
4760000	4766000	But they wanted to do a more realistic time frame for the Big Brother theory.
4766000	4767000	Big Brother is watching you.
4768000	4774000	Of course, if robots do take over 1984, then I'm gonna say that they were pretty pathetic, don't you think?
4776000	4778000	And they also did all the play testing themselves.
4778000	4782000	Well, if I'm alive in 2084, I will be 106.
4782000	4783000	Girl.
4783000	4791000	So, I mean, here's hoping, but I'm thinking I'll be too senile to realize it if robots take over.
4791000	4796000	I'll probably see one of those enemies in this game with the brain that flashes all the different colors.
4796000	4798000	And I'll be like, it's shiny!
4800000	4805000	Well, basically, the game gets harder and harder and harder as it goes on.
4805000	4807000	When are they gonna make a game that gets easier?
4807000	4809000	When are they gonna make a game that gets easier?
4809000	4811000	They should call it Be Rich.
4811000	4813000	And the richer you get, the easier stuff gets.
4815000	4816000	Privilege the game.
4816000	4817000	Yeah, exactly.
4817000	4823000	So, in 2012, though, Eugene Jarvis wrote an evaluation of the Robotron enemy dynamics.
4823000	4832000	So the game is hardcoded with 40 waves, whereupon the game repeats wave 21 through 40 over and over until the game restarts back to original wave 1.
4832000	4835000	That's after wave 255 has been completed.
4835000	4841000	And so he actually put out a whole thing on there and gave details on how to trigger the secret room in Robotron.
4841000	4843000	So, the game was great.
4843000	4844000	It sold quite well.
4844000	4850000	It sold 19,000 arcade cabinets, and many cabs and cocktail versions were also later produced.
4851000	4853000	The different versions have become rarities.
4853000	4858000	Cocktail and cabaret versions are very rare, while the upright cabinets are more available.
4858000	4863000	It is one of the most collected arcade cabinets.
4864000	4870000	And, of course, it led to, of course, all kinds of other games and different things.
4870000	4874000	It actually has an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records.
4874000	4879000	It was listed as the number 11 arcade game with technical, creative, and cultural impact.
4880000	4890000	And it really, you know, the audio design on it, there's just really a lot going on for it.
4890000	4898000	I mean, I know I've already been into the technical aspects of it, but it really was, the simplicity of its gameplay was really a strong point.
4898000	4903000	But it was kind of a technical marvel under the hood for what it did at the time with what it had.
4903000	4908000	And you can say it's simple, but, like, if you're good at this game, like, you get gamer cred.
4908000	4911000	Because this game isn't easy, at least I don't think it's easy at all.
4911000	4915000	Well, and Eugene Jarvis, I mean, he also did Defender and Smash TV.
4915000	4918000	So, like I said, precursor to Smash TV.
4918000	4922000	If anything, I'd say Smash TV was the spiritual sequel to Robotron.
4922000	4927000	I'd buy it. They're very similar in many ways, especially with the twin-stick shooting and all that.
4927000	4930000	So there have been other remakes and sequels.
4930000	4936000	There was a game called Blaster, which was the official sequel, set in the same universe in 2085.
4936000	4940000	It actually is a little bit more maze-like with how you have to move around it.
4940000	4942000	And it's pretty freaking hard.
4942000	4952000	And then, of course, there were other kinds of remakes for the Atari 5200, the 7800, the Apple IIe, Commodore 64, and the TI-99 4A.
4952000	4959000	It also has releases on PlayStation 2 and Xbox compilations, the Midway Arcade Treasures.
4959000	4963000	There's a web-based version of it that runs in Shockwave.
4964000	4968000	So you have no reason not to try this game. Get your Shockwave on.
4968000	4970000	Shockwave is still supported.
4970000	4977000	So, also, Midway was going to do a plug-and-play version as part of their line of TV games, but it never came out.
4977000	4982000	So you can download it via Xbox. Well, you could download it via Xbox Live Arcade.
4982000	4987000	And it was taken down in February 2010 because it had some permission issues.
4987000	4989000	That's weird.
4989000	4994000	I think it is on the Xbox One backwards compatible anyway, though, which is weird.
4994000	5001000	So Jeff Minter, the other developer, did a game called Lomatron based on the design.
5001000	5007000	And then there is another one that came out on iOS called Minitron 2112.
5007000	5010000	There's also Robotron 2.
5010000	5011000	Electric Boogaloo.
5011000	5015000	It was a project that never actually came out.
5015000	5020000	They were really working on it because Demar went back to pinball development and Jarvis went back to college.
5020000	5027000	So they made an appearance. The robots in the game made an appearance in pixels.
5027000	5029000	Did anyone see that movie?
5029000	5031000	They also mentioned it in Ready Player One, the novel.
5031000	5035000	And there's a modified version of the game in Fallout 4's DLC, Automatron.
5036000	5046000	So they're also the world of Robotron 2084 appears in Lego dimensions in a portion of the level called All Your Bricks Are Belong to Us.
5046000	5049000	And there you go. Robotron 2084.
5049000	5051000	All right. There it is.
5051000	5057000	Before we say goodbye to Jamie, anything else that you want to let the listeners know for the week since I know you don't get to sit in on the whole show?
5057000	5059000	Anything? Pineapple is delicious.
5059000	5060000	Pineapple is delicious.
5060000	5067000	I'm planning on trying to make every fourth Sunday to make it, but I have to have time off because I have to pay my bills.
5067000	5068000	But until then...
5068000	5069000	Linda eats a lot, OK?
5069000	5071000	Until then, Radio Magic.
5071000	5072000	Radio Magic.
5072000	5077000	All right. Until next week, there it is, your classic game of the week, Robotron 2084.
5083000	5085000	Isn't Radio Magic awesome?
5085000	5091000	Anyway, here we are on episode number 741 of our show for this, August the 12th of 2018.
5091000	5096000	Continuing on with our program here with just Loki and myself in studio.
5096000	5101000	Dark Sakura gonna be absent from the show here in studio for some time.
5101000	5103000	But we do have Radio Magic, as we just did there.
5103000	5106000	So we'll be able to get her tuned in through Radio Magic.
5106000	5113000	And hopefully, as she mentioned at the end there, fourth weekends of the month and so forth as her work can allow it.
5115000	5122000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase HIP.
5122000	5128000	Anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news. Loki.
5128000	5136000	Yes, so Nintendo has confirmed that the launch of Nintendo Switch Online will launch in the second half of September.
5136000	5138000	So they announced on Twitter.
5138000	5152000	And of course, as they mentioned, the service will provide access to online play and save game data, cloud backups, incompatible games, and a growing library of NES titles that will be added with online play.
5152000	5155000	All right, I'll believe it when I see it.
5155000	5157000	Give me some, I want to see the receipts.
5157000	5159000	I want to see the receipts.
5159000	5163000	I will believe it when I see it because, you know, promises.
5163000	5167000	I'm waiting, waiting to see it.
5167000	5169000	All right.
5169000	5180000	And then in movie news, we've got some more confirmations of who's going to be doing some voice work and in the Sonic the Hedgehog movie.
5180000	5184000	So Sonic is going to be voiced by Ben Schwartz.
5184000	5191000	That's right, Ben Schwartz, who you may remember from various projects like Parks and Rec.
5191000	5197000	Or actually, he does the voice of Dewey on DuckTales, the reboot now.
5197000	5201000	He's going to be doing Sonic the Hedgehog.
5201000	5203000	So that'll be interesting.
5203000	5204000	Want to check that out.
5204000	5219000	And as we mentioned before, Jim Carrey has confirmed that he will be playing Dr. Robotnik in the upcoming movie and basically said, you know, that his portrayal will be live action.
5219000	5220000	Oh, boy.
5220000	5223000	I love Jim Carrey, so of course I'll have to see this movie.
5223000	5226000	I still, there's a part of me that still feels like this movie is going to be so god awful.
5226000	5231000	But like, then again, I just saw Mamma Mia 2 and I loved it.
5231000	5232000	But here's the thing.
5232000	5236000	When I saw Mamma Mia 2, I knew exactly what I was saying.
5236000	5238000	Like, people ask me, was Mamma Mia 2 good?
5238000	5244000	And my answer to that is, look, you need to know exactly what you're going to see.
5244000	5254000	You're not just going to see a silly musical filled with ABBA songs to make you feel good and cry at the same time, but you're seeing a sequel to a movie filled with ABBA songs.
5254000	5257000	So if you know exactly what you're going to go see, then it's fine.
5257000	5260000	It will meet your expectations.
5260000	5270000	So I feel like Sonic the Hedgehog is one of those movies where I'm also going to need to go into it going, all right, y'all, I'm seeing a movie based on Sonic the Hedgehog.
5271000	5274000	Oscar nominee, it will not be.
5274000	5276000	Except, I guess...
5276000	5277000	It could win most popular.
5277000	5279000	Yeah, I guess now.
5279000	5282000	Maybe it could because the Oscars will let anything in now.
5282000	5284000	Anything for ratings.
5284000	5286000	Yup.
5286000	5289000	Yup.
5289000	5291000	Yeah, I'll have to check it out.
5291000	5299000	They also posted, I saw there was a post of a set pic that shows a sign saying, welcome to Green Hill.
5299000	5303000	Green Hill is a little town with a big heart.
5303000	5308000	Well, it looks better than the sign for a Schitt's Creek if you've ever seen that show.
5308000	5309000	I love that show.
5309000	5312000	I was going to say, Loki, if you've never seen Schitt's Creek, I think you did.
5312000	5313000	That show is hilarious.
5313000	5314000	I know, that show is so fucking funny.
5314000	5316000	Anyway, I need to watch more.
5316000	5320000	I've always seen like half the first season, but they're on like season four or five, right?
5320000	5322000	Yeah, I kind of stopped watching that.
5322000	5324000	Oh god. But it's funny.
5324000	5325000	It is funny, yeah.
5325000	5329000	It's like, there's great shows, like Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is funny.
5329000	5333000	I just didn't have time to really watch past season two, but one of these days I'll finish.
5333000	5338000	Anyway, let's talk about a device you can watch all these shows on.
5338000	5341000	The PlayStation 4 Pro. You can even play games.
5341000	5344000	The PlayStation 4 Pro has hit a big milestone.
5344000	5348000	They have sold more than 500 million units worldwide.
5348000	5353000	And to celebrate, Sony is going to release a limited edition PlayStation 4 Pro.
5353000	5356000	It's the 500 million limited edition Pro.
5356000	5359000	They're only going to make 50,000 of these.
5359000	5363000	So you do the math on what percentage of the pros out there will be this.
5363000	5369000	But anyway, they're going to be numbered as well, so I guess that kind of makes it even more, I guess, desirable.
5369000	5370000	I don't know.
5370000	5372000	What's also kind of neat about this, I mean, have you seen like the color?
5372000	5375000	It's really cool. It's like a translucent blue casing to it.
5375000	5377000	It's a really pretty looking thing.
5377000	5383000	Gold lettering on it, and then a translucent blue DualShock and PlayStation Camera.
5383000	5385000	So that's pretty cool.
5385000	5389000	So I might be into that if I had the money to dump on something like that.
5389000	5393000	If I hadn't just bought a PlayStation 4 Pro.
5393000	5400000	That's like when I bought my original Xbox with something like this.
5400000	5404000	I got the Halo Edition Xbox that was like a translucent green.
5405000	5407000	And so it actually looked really cool.
5407000	5410000	It was translucent green, and then the controller was green as well.
5410000	5415000	So yeah, I guess they've been doing these types of things for a while, but anyway.
5415000	5420000	Yeah, and they have that special, there's like two that are going to be extra special on top of that.
5420000	5424000	Because of the dates that coincide with the launch of...
5424000	5427000	What did they say the extra special numbers will do?
5427000	5431000	They didn't say what, but it's going to have something else in there.
5431000	5433000	Alright, well anyhow.
5433000	5438000	If you want to get one of these, $4.99 to pick one of these up on August 24th.
5438000	5442000	If you want to just get the controller, you can get that for $64.99.
5442000	5447000	And there's also going to be a limited edition gold wireless headset with the same translucent blue.
5447000	5451000	It's not part of the box set, but it's just something else available for $100.
5451000	5455000	If you have that kind of money to spend, enjoy.
5455000	5457000	Anyhow, let's talk about Mega Man 11.
5457000	5461000	This is a game you might be playing on your PlayStation 4, or your Switch, or your Xbox.
5461000	5463000	Or a variety of different platforms.
5463000	5468000	Apparently, Mega Man 11 demo is supposed to come out on Xbox One on September 4th.
5468000	5469000	A demo?
5469000	5476000	A demo, which I imagine would be a similar thing, like they'll have something as well on PlayStation 4.
5476000	5479000	They're doing console exclusives for demos now.
5479000	5480000	Yeah, I don't know.
5480000	5486000	In the demo, according to the description, take on all kinds of enemies and traps in the block band stage.
5486000	5492000	And use the new double gear system to slow down time or power up your shots and take down that boss.
5492000	5495000	So it sounds like you'll be able to play a stage from the game.
5495000	5497000	This is a throwback to Xbox 360.
5497000	5501000	Remember back in the Xbox 360 days when all those games had to have demos?
5501000	5503000	All the Xbox Live Arcade games had to have demos?
5503000	5508000	So I think because of that, if memory serves me right, Mega Man 9 had to have a demo.
5508000	5511000	Because it was on Xbox Arcade.
5512000	5517000	Because I feel like there was a demo where you could play one stage in Mega Man 9.
5517000	5519000	Yeah, they all have trial versions.
5519000	5522000	Yeah, so that's probably a similar deal here.
5522000	5525000	And Bobby Blackwell confirming he remembers there was one for Mega Man 9.
5525000	5528000	And Dark Tetsuya said, yep, I remember when it had one stage.
5528000	5530000	So this will probably be similar.
5530000	5535000	And I would imagine Block Man is not the stage you're supposed to play first.
5535000	5537000	So it's going to be challenging.
5537000	5540000	Because, you know, every Mega Man game has its boss order, right?
5540000	5544000	I imagine Block Man is not the first boss you're supposed to beat in Mega Man 11.
5544000	5546000	So it's going to be even.
5546000	5548000	Wouldn't that be a twist?
5548000	5553000	Anyway, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some full versions you can buy very soon.
5553000	5555000	Starting with the US, Loki.
5555000	5559000	Yep, this week we're getting Death's Gambit on PC and Playstation 4.
5559000	5564000	Tanglewood on PC, Mac, and Linux.
5565000	5571000	We've got The Walking Dead, the final season, episode 1 on PC, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.
5571000	5576000	World of Warcraft, Battle for Azeroth on PC and Mac.
5576000	5580000	And Penguin Wars on Nintendo Switch.
5580000	5588000	And State of Mind on PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.
5589000	5594000	And we're only one week away from All Star Fruit Racing for Nintendo Switch.
5594000	5596000	Oh boy.
5596000	5598000	But that's for next, that's the week after, so.
5598000	5600000	Alright.
5600000	5605000	Let's travel to Japan and then of course while Jamie's gone maybe you could fill in on the UK dates hopefully.
5605000	5607000	Alright, cool.
5607000	5613000	So let's travel to Japan real quick where I actually, I don't really see a lot on Playstation 4 this week in Japan.
5613000	5618000	Because the next set of releases I see are all the way out in the 20s.
5618000	5620000	So I guess that's it.
5620000	5624000	I don't know if there's something going on in Japan this week, but Playstation 4 doesn't have anything.
5624000	5630000	Let me check and see if there's something on the Switch that is the reason why it's causing everything to be held up.
5630000	5632000	No, is there a holiday out there or something?
5632000	5634000	I don't know.
5634000	5636000	Yeah, it's an empty week in Japan.
5636000	5640000	There's nothing on Playstation 4, there's nothing on Nintendo Switch, and nothing on Nintendo 3DS.
5640000	5646000	Although there will be, there are more Yokai Watch Blasters games due on the 3DS eventually.
5646000	5651000	So, you know, there's still stuff coming to 3DS.
5651000	5653000	Well there's that WarioWare game that came out recently too.
5653000	5655000	Yeah, I hear that's pretty crazy.
5655000	5658000	Yeah, so anyway, pretty bleak week in Japan.
5658000	5660000	How about the UK?
5660000	5665000	UK, we've got a World of Warcraft, Battle for Azeroth, Collector's Edition, and Dead Cells,
5665000	5671000	which is going to be coming out on Playstation 4, and Switch, and of course World of Warcraft on PC and Mac.
5671000	5673000	And that is it.
5673000	5678000	Alright, let's get to the mailbag.
5684000	5689000	Every week you guys email us, participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com
5689000	5693000	Unless you don't, in which case last week we learned you all got a punishment.
5694000	5695000	Last week.
5695000	5699000	But we actually got, I think the punishment worked, because we got a lot of emails this week.
5701000	5706000	But it's kind of funny what some of these say though, we'll get into it.
5706000	5708000	So we actually have several emails to get into tonight.
5708000	5712000	With Dark Sakura not here, of course I'll be taking over emails for a little bit.
5712000	5714000	So Robert M. starts us off tonight saying,
5714000	5720000	I'm still enjoying the Switch port of Fortnite Battle Royale, but haven't yet invested in a battle pass.
5720000	5724000	My brother's 13 year old son has generally fallen off shooters,
5724000	5729000	but interestingly, his 5 year old son plays it on my console when I bring it over, or he's at my house.
5729000	5732000	5 years old playing Fortnite? I can't even imagine.
5732000	5736000	But I guess then again, I was playing games on the Commodore 64 at like 6 or 7, so.
5736000	5743000	My kid's not playing Fortnite. I haven't thought about downloading it, but he's playing Octodad.
5743000	5746000	He's been like, just tons of Octodad.
5747000	5751000	My brother himself gave the game a try and confessed it was his type of game,
5751000	5755000	although his busy lifestyle doesn't give him much time for gaming, what with his job and two sons.
5755000	5759000	If either tried to join me via mobile, would it necessarily work?
5759000	5763000	I do know the console says, play with same console on screen.
5763000	5769000	Would that change if I had a friends list populated by players with an Epic account on mobile, PC, or Xbox One?
5769000	5775000	Also, is there any chance of the success of Battle Royale bringing the save the world PvE to the Switch?
5775000	5779000	I would say as far as your second question goes, I mean, anything's possible,
5779000	5784000	especially when money does a lot of talking, so I would think with as well as that game's doing on Switch,
5784000	5789000	I would think, sure, why wouldn't they bring the save the world PvE to that as well?
5789000	5794000	I don't play enough Fortnite to really be able to answer your first question. I'd have to defer to chat.
5794000	5798000	I think that it would be cross-play, as long as you're not on PlayStation, of course,
5798000	5800000	because they don't play nice with anyone.
5800000	5804000	Yeah, he says he doesn't have anyone on his friends list that's mobile, PC, or Xbox One,
5804000	5808000	so maybe you have to add some people there through the Epic Games website or through the app?
5808000	5809000	Yeah, I don't know about that.
5809000	5812000	I would try doing that, add some people through the app, and then see...
5812000	5813000	But it's supposed to be everything.
5813000	5815000	Yeah, it is supposed to work.
5815000	5818000	Unless you're a PlayStation, because fuck everybody if you're on PlayStation.
5818000	5821000	PlayStation's on an island all by themselves.
5821000	5823000	All right, thanks for the email.
5823000	5825000	Next email from Redertainment, who says,
5825000	5829000	Dear Jamie, if it's not too much trouble, and I don't mean to pry or demand,
5829000	5833000	but I'd like to hear more stories from the Leatherbar. Thank you.
5833000	5835000	Stay care, Redertainment.
5835000	5841000	Well, joke's on you. She's not here to tell the stories, but maybe with some radio magic,
5841000	5845000	I can pre-record some stories. She loves that.
5845000	5850000	Some stories in advance for when we need punishment in future weeks due to lack of emails.
5850000	5854000	It kind of seems weird that we're talking about punishment and Leatherbar at the same time.
5855000	5858000	This is going in a whole weird BDSM.
5861000	5866000	I'll tell you what, though, if we go like four weeks in a row with no emails,
5866000	5870000	I'm going to tell you about when I went to Chicago and went to a bar called Jackhammer.
5870000	5872000	That's all I'm going to say.
5874000	5877000	It was shocking. It was shocking.
5877000	5879000	What's that? You remember that?
5879000	5884000	I was going to say, you remember that movie, Bruno? Well, you know.
5886000	5890000	No, I never saw it. I didn't want to see that movie because I was just afraid it was going to piss me off.
5890000	5896000	Anyway, let's move on and talk about the next email. The next email is from Brandon.
5896000	5897000	Hi, Brandon.
5897000	5902000	Hi, OLR. I love the show and have listened for about 10 years.
5902000	5906000	That is an awesome accomplishment. Thanks, Brandon.
5906000	5911000	I cannot express the happiness and comfort you all have brought me during this time.
5911000	5916000	You all have been with me through health scares, family issues, and huge social movements.
5916000	5920000	College, moving, first job, etc. during this time.
5920000	5922000	I wish I could express my gratitude beyond an email.
5922000	5927000	I'm so happy you are still podcasting after so many podcasts have dropped off.
5927000	5930000	Thanks for all you do. And that's from Brandon.
5930000	5934000	And there's no questions or anything in there. It's just a nice note.
5934000	5935000	Well, that's nice.
5935000	5937000	Yeah, I know. I can't tell you how much that shit means.
5937000	5940000	Exactly. I'm glad that somebody cares about this shit.
5940000	5943000	I shouldn't call it shit. But I can't tell you how much it means. Like, really.
5943000	5945000	Like, especially, you know, here's the thing, guys.
5945000	5951000	Even though you say in your email, you've all been with me through health scares, family issues, and huge social movements.
5951000	5957000	Something to think about, you've been there for me through all those same things.
5957000	5959000	And with Loki and with Dark Sakura.
5959000	5963000	Like, y'all know I had a fucking terrible year last year.
5963000	5967000	And if you were listening to OLR last year, you know what a crap year I had last year.
5967000	5980000	But this show was, honestly, the first couple weekends, like, this show was the reason I, like, got out of my room or got out of my bed.
5980000	5990000	It's like that constant thing that I have that I feel like my social obligation I have to do on Sunday. You know what I mean?
5990000	5993000	And technically I don't have to do it.
5993000	6001000	But I didn't want to let you guys down. I wanted to be here. I wanted to do something to take my mind off of everything else that was going on.
6001000	6005000	And, you know, I say me, but I know Loki's been in similar situations as has Dark Sakura.
6005000	6007000	And, you know, you guys have been there for me.
6007000	6010000	So, Brandon, it works both ways. It really does.
6010000	6014000	And so when I hear somebody who's been there for, like, ten years, I'm so fucking impressed.
6014000	6016000	And I'm so, like, honored and thanked.
6016000	6021000	Honestly, somebody survived through ten minutes of this episode, I'm thankful and I'm honored.
6021000	6022000	Yeah.
6022000	6026000	Especially after Loki shattered all your speakers in part A.
6026000	6028000	Ah, they're used to it by now.
6028000	6031000	Alright. And thank you. You guys are talking some nice things in chat.
6031000	6035000	She-Hulk says, thank you for doing the podcast. You do an excellent job.
6035000	6039000	Well, you know what? You guys do an excellent job of providing commentary in our chat.
6039000	6042000	And, honestly, live fact-checking. You guys are really good at it.
6042000	6046000	In fact, sometimes it pisses me off how good you guys are. No, I'm kidding.
6046000	6048000	Dungeon Buster says, thanks for spending your Sundays with us.
6048000	6050000	Well, thanks for spending your Sundays with us.
6050000	6052000	Aw, group hug. Bring it in.
6052000	6059000	Alright. Let's go into this last email tonight, which comes from...
6059000	6062000	It's not signed, so I'll just say Jamie.
6062000	6065000	Not to be confused with our Jamie. It's a different Jamie.
6065000	6071000	Jamie says, just wanted to say that I really appreciate that you have a decently long show.
6071000	6073000	You make the work shift fly by.
6073000	6078000	But it got me wondering, is there some way to track back to some of your older episodes?
6078000	6081000	Like an archive I can dig around in.
6081000	6085000	I'd actually be curious to listen to the first episode of OLR.
6085000	6087000	That does exist.
6087000	6090000	Technically, it's not something we officially endorse.
6090000	6094000	But it's one of those things where I think it's cool that it exists.
6094000	6099000	But I'm gonna tell you why we don't officially try to direct you to find the first episode of OLR.
6099000	6102000	Because it was a very different show back then.
6102000	6106000	It took us a long time to get the polish.
6106000	6109000	And even now, do we really have that much of a polish?
6109000	6112000	But you go to those first few episodes of OLR, they can be a little rough.
6112000	6119000	And it's also tricky to distribute those episodes because we played music a lot during the show.
6119000	6123000	Because it wasn't podcast back then. That's kind of like what you did.
6123000	6126000	We tried to make a morning show but on Sunday nights type of thing.
6126000	6130000	Where we'd have a little segment, do some music, come back to a segment, do some music.
6130000	6135000	And because our show was so influenced by music-based games, we always had music to play.
6135000	6138000	We were playing the latest DDR music and all that stuff.
6138000	6144000	So I warn you, if you go chasing those old episodes down and they're out there,
6144000	6147000	just expect that it's gonna be a very different show.
6147000	6149000	And here's the other thing.
6149000	6153000	Because this is what people do in the year 2018.
6153000	6158000	I'm not gonna take responsibility for some of the things that have been said on those earlier episodes.
6158000	6159000	Oh god, yes.
6159000	6161000	Because here's the thing.
6161000	6164000	This show has existed for 15 years.
6164000	6170000	And there are probably things I've said on this show, and Loki said on this show, and Jamie said on this show even,
6170000	6173000	15 years ago, that probably wouldn't be okay to say now.
6173000	6177000	Of course, I tried to say things that were the most offensive things I could think of at the time.
6177000	6185000	So, if you are trying to dig up old episodes to use that shit against us now, like, fucking don't.
6185000	6188000	First off, no one's gonna give a shit because they're like, who?
6188000	6189000	Yeah, exactly, who?
6189000	6198000	But at the same time, I would not be surprised at all if I heard a phrase on television, on Project Runway,
6198000	6202000	like, hot tea dash dash dash mess.
6202000	6206000	I probably would've used that phrase here on the show because I loved Project Runway at the time.
6206000	6212000	I wouldn't use that phrase now because I realize that that is, like, I've come a long way and I've learned
6212000	6215000	that that word is very offensive and holds a lot of weight to some people.
6215000	6218000	And I don't wanna offend those people.
6218000	6222000	So, that's all I'm gonna say, again, as well as to digging up old shit.
6223000	6228000	Because that seems to be the thing to do now to people is dig up the fucking archives from such and such day
6228000	6229000	and find the dirt.
6229000	6234000	And I imagine, look, I'm not saying this as an excuse to yell at you, Jamie,
6234000	6239000	because I'm sure your intentions are very pure and very good and I really appreciate that,
6239000	6241000	but I just kinda wanna get that out there.
6241000	6248000	If y'all are gonna seek out back episodes, we probably said some shit on those episodes that we regret saying.
6248000	6255000	So, please do not come at me with, why did you say such XYZ thing on episode five and six?
6255000	6261000	Because we were stupid then and we're stupid now and still learning every day,
6261000	6265000	but we're trying to do better with every day as I think most decent people are.
6265000	6267000	So, anyhow, there you go.
6267000	6274000	SSJ100Matt says, the first hundred episodes of OLR were very different, but the same humor and fun is still there.
6274000	6278000	Yeah, I think it was 138 was the magic number.
6278000	6283000	Was 138 when the podcast and the live show got married?
6283000	6284000	I don't remember.
6284000	6286000	Because for those who don't know the history of OLR-
6286000	6287000	It's probably on the wiki.
6287000	6288000	It is on the wiki.
6288000	6289000	Well, I'm hoping Dark Dead Studio probably just knows.
6289000	6291000	Yeah, Dark Dead Studio, 170.
6291000	6292000	Okay, thank you.
6292000	6297000	I think 130 was when we started doing the podcast concurrently with the live show.
6297000	6299000	It was around that number, like 131 or 132.
6299000	6304000	Because for those who don't know the history of OLR, we were a live show dedicated to music games.
6304000	6311000	And then when we found out about podcasting, we were like, well, let's do like this OLR to go edition that's going to be about all video games.
6311000	6313000	Yeah, because podcasts were like-
6313000	6314000	Was brand new.
6314000	6315000	Ten minutes, like-
6315000	6326000	Yeah, it was like 10, 20 minutes, you know, and that was, it was like, and so it started like this 20 minute side podcast and then it grew and grew and then fucking iTunes got podcasting.
6326000	6333000	We were on it and that's when our show kind of exploded and we've never been that big ever since.
6333000	6337000	But then it was like our to go edition started to become like an hour long.
6337000	6351000	Then there was a point where we kind of sat there and went, okay, so we have our three hour live show we're doing that has maybe 2% of the listeners right now that we have an iTunes on our to go edition.
6351000	6357000	And right now there ain't a whole lot happening in music gaming because Konami wasn't making new music games at the time.
6357000	6361000	Guitar Hero had not quite yet broken through yet, so it was in that weird low.
6361000	6369000	So we just made a decision. We were like, you know what, we're going to take our old format and our new content and make that one show.
6369000	6371000	And that was the show you hear now.
6372000	6382000	So that OLR started, I guess it started to, has it marked episode 170 was kind of the first of the modern OLR, I suppose.
6382000	6393000	But I still think the years before it count, which is why I say we've been doing what we've been doing for 16 years and why there are really not a lot of shows that are able to get very close to that.
6393000	6399000	Because we did kind of have the jump by having a live show for as long as we did before podcasting was even a thing.
6399000	6403000	So, anyway, um, yeah.
6403000	6407000	Dark Tetsuya says, of course, the very first week we did the podcast, they went and announced DDR Supernova.
6407000	6412000	Yeah, I'd like to think that was just really just so that Jason Enos could get at us.
6412000	6414000	No, I'm just kidding. I'm making that up.
6414000	6419000	Obviously that came from, uh, actually it was really cool because we got to go to that Konami event where they unveiled Supernova.
6419000	6422000	You were like the second person in the US to play DDR Supernova.
6422000	6425000	Oh yeah, I did. I had Naoki watching me.
6425000	6427000	Yeah, that was awesome. Anyway.
6427000	6430000	Cause everyone was like, cause I think they were doing, everyone was like playing Metal Gear Solid 3.
6430000	6432000	Yeah, cause all these other games were announced.
6432000	6436000	I'm like, fuck that shit. I'm all over Supernova. I don't give a shit about your fuck.
6436000	6441000	Well, they had also BeatMania. That was the home version of BeatMania that came over. BeatMania US.
6441000	6447000	But I was like, fuck that shit. I don't give a shit about that. I'm playing Supernova cause I want to play that.
6447000	6452000	Uh, Raginator in chat says, OLR so old that the host can't remember how goddamn old the show is.
6452000	6455000	You're right. Cause YYR keeps saying it's 16 years by the way, not 15.
6455000	6465000	You're right. I should know better. 15 is a rounder number for some reason. I keep saying 15. 15 plus. 15 plus. Fourth mix plus.
6465000	6471000	Um, and then uh, here's the link. If you really want to get to the old shows.
6471000	6479000	Dark Tetsuya has an archive up. It's over at bit.ly, like the little URL shortener, slash OLR chive.
6479000	6486000	It's supposed to be OLR archive, but it reads like OLR chive. So there it is.
6486000	6493000	But again, please remember all those disclaimers I gave you about the old content. It is old content.
6493000	6498000	All right. That wasn't all of Jamie's email though. Sorry. We derailed halfway through that happens sometimes.
6498000	6507000	Um, so the second part of the email goes, Oh, and by the way, I'm not sure about the other listeners, but you can go ahead and pretend that you didn't get any emails again.
6507000	6515000	I almost didn't send this one because Jamie's so-called punishment stories are a kick. Ha ha.
6515000	6523000	He all better be careful because maybe next year we'll just get rid of classic game of the week and we'll just have Jamie's story time of the week.
6523000	6528000	All right. Thank you so much for the email, Jamie. And thank you everybody for the emails. I really appreciate that.
6528000	6533000	And you guys know that there's always going to be random stories of some sort here on the show.
6533000	6541000	I just, I just really like to get emails. You guys, I'm also curious because this question kind of came up offline.
6541000	6545000	Is there like another way you guys would want to interact with us? Like, because here's the thing.
6545000	6552000	And I know it's a weird question, but like, I also kind of also realize that email is getting a little more and more dated.
6552000	6557000	Like, I feel like people aren't using email as much as they are like Facebook messenger.
6557000	6563000	Right? Like I don't, I don't email Alan when I need to get his attention. I send him a message on Google Hangouts.
6563000	6569000	Or I text a friend or I use Facebook Messenger for some people. It's kind of weird because like I jump on this platform.
6569000	6576000	It's called Google Plus. We're there. Did you know ORLR has a Google Plus page?
6576000	6582000	Don't you remember the foogle question of the week, you old man? Man, we're on the same platform as Infowars.
6583000	6592000	Ah, fuck off. Alright, anyway. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, we use all dated stuff here.
6592000	6597000	IRC, dated. Email, dated. Shoutcast, dated. Forums, dated. But now dated. Skype, dated.
6597000	6600000	Everybody wants to get us, get a hold of us through Ello.
6600000	6606000	Sia Tabiri in chat says, I'm holding out for the Scruff profile.
6606000	6609000	That's right. ORLR, now available on Grindr.
6614000	6617000	Be sure to swipe right and set a date with ORLR.
6620000	6627000	Alright, anyhow. Look, we're asking a lot of these same questions and Bobby says all that stuff.
6627000	6634000	But, you know, there might be a winky face there. Anyway, let's move on and talk about some more gaming news.
6634000	6639000	We have more stories to get to. And then our ancient fucking Skype line at Orange Laundry.
6639000	6642000	Which, I don't, why is everybody saying Skype is dated?
6642000	6650000	Like, I talked to you guys, like, a couple months ago about how I was playing one of those online Facebook survivor-y type of games, right?
6650000	6653000	Because, like, it was my mystery project I was working on for a little while.
6653000	6660000	And it all fucking uses Skype. And the people that played that game and the communities, they all still use Skype.
6660000	6662000	I'm in, like, all these group Skype chats.
6662000	6670000	So, what is the new, if it's dated, then what is the current way? Is it supposed to be through, you know...
6670000	6676000	Many shows, especially in the gaming community, are using Discord in this day and age.
6676000	6683000	So, what'll happen is that you'll set up a channel and if somebody wants to call in, quote unquote, they go to a special channel on Discord.
6683000	6688000	And you can, like, pull that person into, like, your live call room and you talk to them through Discord.
6688000	6695000	And I don't, but here's, so, like, I would assume some of the advantages of that is you don't have to add anybody to a contact list.
6695000	6701000	It's open, it's public, it's easy to get to. You can do it on your mobile phone or you can do it on your desktop.
6701000	6703000	But you can do Skype on your mobile phone or your desktop.
6703000	6708000	So, that's why I always kind of like Skype, was that, and why I've kind of shifted to what you'll notice.
6708000	6710000	I don't even give out a phone number anymore, because who uses that anymore?
6710000	6715000	Plus, Skype is on some game consoles, whereas Discord is not on game consoles.
6715000	6720000	It is, it is. But I don't know, but for some reason, that's what the kids today are using, is Discord.
6720000	6727000	So, it's interesting, anyway. Also, to an extent, Google Hangouts, I think, still.
6727000	6734000	To an extent. I think it's a little harder to arrange your live calls through there, but I remember a time when Skype was down for an extended period,
6734000	6737000	that we were looking at doing Google Hangouts as, like, a stopgap.
6737000	6744000	So, I don't know. But anyway, our ancient fucking Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio coming up after some more news.
6744000	6745000	Lowkey, let's get back to gaming.
6745000	6748000	Let's talk about Bethesda again. Yay!
6748000	6758000	This time, I don't know. It's not a huge deal, but Bethesda is basically threatening that they're not going to release the Elder Scrolls Legends on systems that don't allow cross-play.
6758000	6762000	That would be probably like, you know, the PlayStation 4.
6762000	6767000	The Elder Scrolls Legends is a strategy card game that encompasses both single and multiplayer.
6767000	6772000	It's both cross-platform play and cross-platform progress.
6773000	6779000	But it would only be cross-play on certain systems. It is our intention for the game to come out.
6779000	6789000	It has to be one of those things on any system. We cannot have a game that works one way across everywhere else, except for one thing.
6789000	6796000	And the way the game works right now on Apple, Google, Steam, and BethesdaNet, it doesn't matter where you buy the stuff.
6796000	6799000	If you play it on another platform, the stuff is there.
6799000	6804000	It doesn't matter on what platform you play on. You play it against anybody else who was playing it at that moment.
6804000	6809000	There's no, oh, it's easier to control, or, oh, it has a better frame rate on the system.
6809000	6812000	It's a strategy card game. It doesn't matter.
6812000	6820000	So basically saying that, you know, they're talking to their platform partners, but those terms are non-negotiable.
6820000	6828000	We can't be talking about one version of Legends where you take your progress with you and another version where it stays within that ecosystem walled off from everyone else.
6828000	6831000	There's your shade thrown at Sony.
6831000	6840000	Sony is going to break on this stance. They are under so much, Sony is going to break on this stance, and they're going to do it in a very public fashion.
6840000	6848000	Probably it's going to be one of their announcements at PSX, is that they're going to announce that Fortnite will soon be like cross playable with Nintendo Switch or something.
6848000	6855000	They're gonna, they're gonna bulge on it because there's so much public pressure going on, but they're gonna do it in a fashion where everybody can cheer and go,
6855000	6859000	good guy Sony, and we'll all forget that they were ever the bad guy in the first place.
6859000	6863000	I never forget. I never forget.
6863000	6865000	Do you? Alright.
6865000	6868000	Fuck you EA and your stupid online pass.
6868000	6873000	YYR says Sony is under no pressure. Sony will do what Sony wants to do.
6873000	6877000	YYR, have you ever read the replies to a PlayStation tweet recently?
6877000	6883000	And look, I get Twitter is not always the most accurate representation of society. I completely understand that.
6883000	6891000	However, I do, I do think there's a lot of loud clamoring about Sony and the thing is some of this starts to get reported on in the press.
6891000	6898000	And then you have things like this that Bethesda is coming out and saying, if Sony doesn't change, then we're going to release everywhere.
6898000	6904000	I think Sony's stance on this will be, and I quote them, actually, I'm going to quote Bethesda here.
6904000	6909000	It's a strategy guard game. It doesn't matter. So they're not going to fucking care.
6910000	6921000	Sony is going to fuck themselves the exact same way Microsoft fucked themselves when Street Fighter 5 got announced as an exclusive for what?
6921000	6927000	Sony and PC. Just wait, there's going to be something like this that's going to come out and they're going to say,
6927000	6931000	Oh, it's Microsoft switch and PC and it's not coming for Sony.
6931000	6934000	And it's going to be much bigger than a strategy guard game.
6935000	6940000	You joke. I know it's joke. They'll come through joke.
6940000	6944000	Anyway, someday. All right.
6946000	6952000	Uh, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, hell, the Sony Fortnite story made it to CNBC or Fox business during E3.
6952000	6957000	They interviewed Reggie and asked him about Sony and Fortnite. Reggie's like, that's up to them.
6957000	6961000	You'll have to ask them. That's very true. Fuck those guys.
6962000	6971000	Anyhow. Um, YYR says a very vocal, tiny minority does not speak as loud as the millions of dollars pouring in from loyal PlayStation gamers.
6971000	6983000	Yes and no. Again, we just reported on Bethesda or you'll discuss Bethesda is about to not release a game on a Sony platform because of this.
6983000	6990000	And maybe it's, Oh well, it's a card game this time, but what developer is it going to be next time?
6990000	6997000	I remember they have other games other than card games. They have like the other scroll six or whatever the other game there.
6997000	7002000	But this it's there's Skyrim again. I'm just, this is what I'm saying.
7002000	7011000	History will repeat itself except this time it's going to be Sony and not Microsoft.
7011000	7021000	Just like when the PlayStation three was first announced and it was Sony and not migrant like the history will repeat itself.
7021000	7029000	I guarantee it. All right. Anyhow, let's move on.
7029000	7034000	Let's talk about torchlight. Why not? We talked about Diablo earlier in the show.
7034000	7040000	Should we talk about torchlight? Well, sadly, I'm not here to talk about torchlight three, but this sounds like it might be just as awesome.
7040000	7048000	If not more awesome torchlight frontiers has been announced. It is a shared world action RPG.
7048000	7051000	And of course it's the same universe as torchlight one and two.
7051000	7058000	So this time the reason why they're calling it a different thing is because it is a shared persistent dynamically generated world.
7058000	7062000	So players and their pets will hack and slack their way through the game.
7062000	7068000	There'll be ancient ruins of lost civilizations and of course, loot, loot, loot more to come at a later date.
7068000	7073000	Of course, this game is in development at extra games. Sorry if I mispronounced that.
7073000	7079000	Runic Games and Blizzard North co-founder Max Schaeffer is behind extra games leading this.
7079000	7084000	And a lot of the team is folks that have worked on Diablo previously and torchlight.
7084000	7086000	That's why a lot of people love torchlight.
7086000	7090000	Gamescom 2018 and PAX West will be the first time to get your hands on it.
7090000	7092000	So I'm guessing that's when more information will be out.
7092000	7095000	One more quote here from Max Schaeffer who says,
7095000	7099000	Evolving the torchlight universe into a shared world has always been a goal for the franchise.
7099000	7101000	I'm excited that we're finally able to make it a reality.
7101000	7107000	Torchlight frontiers will be a living, breathing universe that will still feel uniquely torchlight with our own creative spin.
7107000	7114000	The team is building something truly special and we can't wait for fans to play it for the first time at Gamescom and PAX West.
7114000	7118000	It will be available on PC, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.
7118000	7122000	Well, I guess we know that persistent world won't be shared between all those platforms.
7122000	7128000	But actually, I kind of dig the idea of like a one world, one persistent world type of thing.
7128000	7130000	That's going to be very interesting in a Diablo-esque type of game.
7130000	7133000	So I'm kind of curious how that's going to pan out.
7133000	7135000	And the torchlight games are really good.
7135000	7141000	Like, you know, torchlight 2 was a good, especially because torchlight 2 and Diablo 3 kind of came out around the same time.
7141000	7145000	And it was like Diablo 3 when it first came out was a bit, bit turdy.
7145000	7150000	So torchlight 2 is a really good kind of like thing to play while they were making Diablo 3 better.
7150000	7153000	And then by the time you kind of wore out torchlight 2, it was like, oh, Diablo 3 is better again.
7153000	7156000	So, yeah, I'd be very interested to see where this goes.
7156000	7158000	So I kind of like that they're doing something a little different with it.
7158000	7160000	So I'll be checking out torchlight frontiers.
7160000	7166000	I hope those of you that are going to one of these conventions that we name check there will get to check that out as well.
7166000	7167000	Loki.
7167000	7168000	All right.
7168000	7174000	And then let's talk a little bit about Germany and what Germany can now do.
7174000	7183000	So it used to be that any sort of Nazi imagery in games in Germany would have to be censored.
7183000	7196000	Well, now after pressure, I guess, from the German Games Industry Association, the government has relaxed their laws regarding that in certain circumstances.
7196000	7204000	So now, long story short, they can go ahead and show Nazi imagery in video games again.
7204000	7208000	So it doesn't have to be censored in the new Wolfenstein game, for example.
7208000	7214000	Well, I'm not particularly one to celebrate this news.
7214000	7219000	However, I understand if we don't learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it.
7219000	7227000	So from a, I suppose, educational and historical accuracy type of, you know, place.
7227000	7229000	So I get it.
7229000	7230000	Yeah.
7230000	7235000	So that's where that symbol needs to stay.
7235000	7237000	I want to make that very clear, too.
7237000	7238000	Right.
7238000	7239000	Yeah.
7239000	7240000	All right.
7240000	7244000	Let's talk about Facebook and AR gaming on Facebook.
7244000	7251000	Now, I know when I say AR games, you might think about stuff like Pokemon Go, because it kind of like it sort of has like the AR mode in there, although I never use it.
7251000	7258000	The only time I've ever used the AR thing on Pokemon Go is when you have to use it to get Mew.
7258000	7259000	Oh, you have to?
7259000	7260000	Yeah.
7260000	7262000	But it's not as bad as it sounds.
7262000	7264000	It's just part of like the little magic.
7264000	7266000	But it's very like Mew.
7266000	7267000	Spoiler alert.
7267000	7269000	Mew is a guaranteed catch on the third ball.
7269000	7271000	You throw the first ball, it shakes once.
7271000	7272000	Throw the second ball, it shakes twice.
7272000	7273000	Third ball, you're always going to catch it.
7273000	7278000	So it's just, it's just a cute little thing to do.
7278000	7282000	Yeah, I don't play with the augmented reality part on because that's just like...
7282000	7283000	No, it'll turn it on.
7283000	7284000	It'll turn it on.
7284000	7285000	I know, I know.
7285000	7288000	You have to have a phone that doesn't support it at all to have Mew be a regular catch.
7288000	7292000	Because it's just like, it's like, hey, it's battery drain mode, you know?
7292000	7293000	No, thanks.
7293000	7294000	Yeah.
7294000	7297000	Well, anyway, Facebook, because, you know, Facebook really wants to get into gaming.
7297000	7301000	Somehow, or it seems like, I swear to God, I feel like every six months on this show
7301000	7305000	we're like, here's how Facebook plans to get into gaming and then nothing.
7305000	7308000	Whatever happened to the competitive Pac-Man and messaging and stuff?
7308000	7310000	They have it, but no one gives a shit about it.
7310000	7311000	Yeah, I know, right?
7311000	7312000	Anyway.
7312000	7315000	Because every time everybody thinks about Facebook, they think about, oh, hey, they're
7315000	7317000	stealing our data.
7317000	7318000	That's true.
7318000	7322000	Anyway, or, oh, hey, that's where grandma posts all her racist shit.
7322000	7323000	It's on Facebook, right?
7323000	7324000	Anyway.
7324000	7326000	Pretty soon it's going to have to be Google Plus.
7326000	7331000	Anyway, going over to AR gaming in Messenger.
7331000	7336000	That's where Messenger's going to be doing AR gaming in video chats on the mobile apps.
7336000	7341000	So six people can play these simple competitive games and you can use your face.
7341000	7346000	You use the little star button to pick a game and that will let you play.
7346000	7352000	So some games you can play feature such soon to be classics as Asteroids Attack,
7352000	7357000	where you steer a spaceship around obstacles with your nose.
7357000	7365000	There's another game called Don't Smile, which it's a fucking staring contest.
7365000	7368000	It is a fucking staring contest as an AR game.
7368000	7373000	So I actually think these games sound so ridiculous.
7373000	7378000	Don't Smile is what I'm going to be doing when I get a request for somebody to play.
7378000	7380000	Don't Smile.
7380000	7382000	Like, fuck off, you know. No.
7382000	7387000	Don't Smile is what I think about when somebody wants to play an AR Facebook game with me.
7387000	7391000	No, but these sound so ridiculous.
7391000	7394000	I almost want to do a live stream of playing these ridiculous ass games.
7394000	7398000	Let's see, there are also, there's more future editions coming soon.
7398000	7402000	Beach Bump, where you bounce a ball between players.
7402000	7407000	And lastly, but not leastly, Kitten Craze, where you match cats.
7407000	7410000	I don't know how you do that with your face, but I'm told you match cats.
7410000	7412000	It's a kitty matching game.
7412000	7417000	Anyhow, this is all part of Facebook's strategy to keep you involved using the Messenger app,
7417000	7421000	because, as we just mentioned earlier, people are using Messenger where, you know,
7421000	7424000	email was what was used before, but now people are looking at other things,
7424000	7428000	like Discord, like Skype, like Slack, whatever.
7428000	7433000	So anyway, yeah, I guess there might be some people that are into this.
7433000	7436000	You know, if you're like 14, I guess this stuff would be hilarious,
7436000	7439000	but I don't think I'll be using it anytime soon.
7439000	7442000	Yeah, that's going to be a no for me.
7442000	7444000	A no for me, dog.
7444000	7450000	Is anyone out there in our chat going to play Don't Smile?
7450000	7454000	Or, you know what Don't Smile is?
7454000	7457000	It's a way for the government to watch you using your video camera.
7457000	7459000	That's what Don't Smile is.
7459000	7462000	Don't smile. The president is watching you.
7465000	7469000	All right. YYR in chat says, nah, I'd lose right away.
7469000	7472000	Yeah, with certain people, the minute their face comes on screen, it's going to happen.
7472000	7475000	Just come up on the screen smiling, oh, damn, I lost, bye.
7477000	7478000	Hang on.
7478000	7480000	All right, a few more stories for you, Loki.
7480000	7485000	So Discord is going to be launching their own curated game store.
7485000	7487000	I wondered how they were going to make money.
7487000	7488000	Haven't you wondered that?
7488000	7491000	Haven't you sat there wondering, how is Discord going to make money?
7491000	7494000	Like, everybody is using, like, there's tons of things on Discord right now,
7494000	7499000	which, by the way, guys, don't forget, you can go to vognetwork.com slash Discord
7499000	7501000	and join the official VOG Network Discord.
7503000	7508000	So anyways, there's a new tab, I guess it's called Games,
7508000	7510000	or Store or something like that,
7510000	7512000	and basically they're going to offer games on there,
7512000	7515000	and they even have a program which is a first on Discord program,
7515000	7521000	which funds any game developers in exchange for temporary exclusives.
7521000	7524000	Exclusivity window usually lasts 90 days,
7524000	7530000	and there'll be some new universal library that will scan for games on your machine
7530000	7534000	and, I guess, boot the launchers for those games.
7536000	7543000	You know, I have to say, the first on Discord thing reminds me a lot of the Ouya.
7544000	7547000	Because they had a similar program as well.
7547000	7548000	They did.
7548000	7549000	They did.
7549000	7551000	It was the first on Ouya, and...
7552000	7553000	Ouya, that wasn't very good.
7553000	7554000	Ouya!
7555000	7556000	Ouya? Oh yeah!
7559000	7563000	What do you think about the whole, like, Discord game store as a whole, though?
7563000	7565000	Do you think it's something that could really give Steam a run for its money?
7565000	7568000	I mean, I guess it's early to be thinking things like that, but...
7569000	7572000	I don't know, I did notice that they switched it so that when you boot up the app,
7572000	7574000	which many people have when they boot up their computer,
7574000	7578000	now it starts showing you, like, gaming news by default.
7578000	7581000	And it's kind of targeted at, like, the games that you play.
7581000	7587000	So, like, I'll see gaming news, I'll see the common games that I play,
7587000	7588000	like a quick launch bar.
7588000	7592000	I'm gonna tell you right now, this is a good thing for indie gamers,
7592000	7597000	or indie games, because I can put my game on Steam,
7597000	7601000	where it's gonna get hidden in that pile of garbage,
7601000	7604000	or I can put my game on this service that hardly has anything on it,
7604000	7606000	and it's gonna get more views on it.
7606000	7607000	Interesting.
7607000	7609000	So I think that's where they have an advantage there.
7609000	7614000	Well, I just, I think Discord kind of backdoor their store into so many computers
7614000	7617000	by launching this as a free chat.
7617000	7621000	I mean, so many people, because Discord is basically doing what Slack was doing,
7621000	7625000	but not charging anybody for it, and it has, like, all that voice chat built in.
7625000	7629000	So, so many people are going to Discord, and as we've seen in the media,
7629000	7631000	and I don't want to get too far down this rabbit hole,
7631000	7635000	but even certain non-gaming things have started using Discord,
7635000	7637000	and some of them have been extremely controversial,
7637000	7641000	and Discord has rightly, you know, put the smackdown on many of those,
7641000	7645000	like, crappy things that were there, because I guess it would be kind of hard
7645000	7648000	for Discord to police what is gaming and what is not gaming.
7648000	7649000	You know what I mean?
7649000	7650000	Yeah.
7650000	7654000	So, but anyway, but now, I guess Discord, to its credit,
7654000	7659000	by backdooring this whole store into, so Discord was kind of like a Trojan horse
7659000	7660000	this whole time, in a way.
7660000	7663000	It wheeled its way into your computer as a free chat service,
7663000	7666000	and now, ta-da, it's a store, and gaming news and all this,
7666000	7672000	but with it being now a branded gaming store, and gaming news, and all this stuff,
7672000	7676000	now it's very much a gaming service, and hopefully is less attractive
7676000	7680000	for things that have nothing to do with gaming that shouldn't be on Discord,
7680000	7682000	or anywhere, for that matter.
7682000	7684000	So, anyway.
7684000	7685000	Rama in chat says,
7685000	7688000	Slack is more for businesses than it is for games.
7688000	7693000	Yeah, it is, but I think about, like, you know, like, Ingressors,
7693000	7696000	I know, use Slack a lot, and I'm sure there's other,
7696000	7700000	I've seen certain other gaming communities use Slack.
7700000	7704000	I know, like, certain development communities,
7704000	7706000	which I guess is kind of business, have used Slack.
7706000	7709000	A lot of these things were kind of built before Discord.
7709000	7713000	So, I mean, there are gaming communities that have used Slack.
7713000	7716000	There was a hot minute where we were looking at Slack for VOG Network,
7716000	7720000	but it was, like, literally five seconds later, Discord came out,
7720000	7722000	and you know what the key difference was?
7722000	7725000	Well, besides cost. That's a big one.
7725000	7730000	The key difference was that with Slack, you have to invite people to it,
7730000	7735000	and that's, like, making people ask for an invite is going to turn away
7735000	7738000	so many people that are not going to bother to ask for an invite.
7738000	7741000	But with Discord, you can leave the front door open and say,
7741000	7743000	come on in, party's over here.
7743000	7746000	So when I say go to vognetwork.com slash Discord,
7746000	7747000	that's exactly what you're doing.
7747000	7749000	You're just going to the front door and walking on in
7749000	7751000	because you're able to do, like, an open invite.
7751000	7755000	And the fact that it's free is also kind of another big, big, big, you know,
7755000	7757000	selling point on that.
7757000	7762000	But, you know, I get that Slack is also used in a lot of business type of situations.
7762000	7765000	So, hmm. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,
7765000	7769000	yeah, I live on Slack on the weekdays and Discord on the weekends.
7769000	7772000	Anyway. All right.
7772000	7774000	One more story for you guys,
7774000	7777000	and I think many of you guys have seen this floating around the internet.
7777000	7780000	Have you seen this kind of like this meme that's out there,
7780000	7786000	this story about the man on the bike, the 70-year-old man, Chen San Wan,
7786000	7789000	old man who lives in Taiwan. He's 70 years old.
7789000	7793000	He has a rig hooked up to his bicycle
7793000	7797000	where he plays nine phones at a time.
7797000	7800000	I guess apparently, though, there is a setup that would allow for 11,
7800000	7802000	but he basically has them all strapped to his bike,
7802000	7805000	and you can see this in the little, I guess there's like a news thing
7805000	7809000	that's floating around that you can see this in him playing the game.
7809000	7813000	There's a battery that powers all these phones on the bike, of course,
7813000	7817000	that will provide power to all these phones up to 20 hours.
7817000	7820000	And I'm thinking, like, everybody's seen this guy in their town.
7820000	7822000	I don't know about you at Pokémon Go raids,
7822000	7826000	but I've seen this person that brings, it's not on a bike,
7826000	7829000	but a fucking clipboard or a board with,
7829000	7833000	and I think the most number of phones I've seen on a board is seven.
7833000	7837000	I've seen somebody bring seven phones on a board to a raid where it's like,
7837000	7841000	they could do this raid by themselves with all of their phones,
7841000	7845000	but it's easier to do it with other people or whatever,
7845000	7847000	or sometimes, you know, especially because,
7847000	7850000	but I was like, how do you tap all those phones at once?
7850000	7851000	And they actually showed me.
7851000	7855000	If you face the phones, like, one upside down and one next to you,
7855000	7857000	so the ball button is at the bottom,
7857000	7859000	or it's just at the top in one place and at the bottom in another,
7859000	7863000	then you spread your fingers out like this,
7863000	7865000	and you go up and down the screen.
7865000	7867000	You tap, tap, tap, tap.
7867000	7868000	You go up and down your clipboard.
7868000	7870000	You tap each one once really fast,
7870000	7873000	and that's how you battle with like six or seven at once.
7873000	7875000	Isn't that crazy?
7875000	7879000	This is totally violating the, you know, terms of service.
7879000	7881000	I know, and like, as an Ingress player.
7881000	7882000	Like, I get it.
7882000	7885000	Like, oh, it's so quaint that this old man, like, fuck you.
7885000	7887000	I don't give a shit how old you are.
7887000	7889000	You're fucking breaking the rules.
7889000	7891000	But at the same time, like, I understand.
7891000	7892000	Like, here's the thing.
7892000	7895000	Yeah, the Ingresser in me is like, this is so wrong,
7895000	7896000	but at the same time, I'm like, you know what?
7896000	7898000	Pokemon Go, it's a different game,
7898000	7902000	and I just, I just, if that's how somebody wants to spend their money,
7902000	7903000	spend their time, spend their life.
7903000	7906000	Better than them doing that and also, you know.
7906000	7907000	I support.
7907000	7908000	GPS hacking.
7908000	7913000	Yeah, I was going to say, I support that way more than I support GPS hacking.
7913000	7915000	That's, you know what?
7915000	7917000	If you want to ride around on a bike with 20 phones,
7917000	7920000	at least you're out there on a bike doing it yourself,
7920000	7923000	and you're not, like, fucking cheating from your basement.
7923000	7924000	So, you know what?
7924000	7926000	If you want a multi-account, go right ahead.
7926000	7928000	In Pokemon Go, go right ahead.
7928000	7932000	But if you want a multi-account in PvP games like Ingress, fuck right off.
7932000	7934000	That's my opinion.
7934000	7935000	Anyway.
7936000	7939000	S2100mattinchat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
7939000	7942000	the one guy I talked to with four phones was an older man
7942000	7945000	who is playing on his kids' and his wife's account.
7945000	7949000	They can't raid during the day, so on my lunch break, I play for them.
7949000	7954000	And to be fair, there have been times where I've been,
7954000	7958000	especially when it was easier to catch unknowns because of the scanners,
7958000	7963000	I would be like, one time an unknown spawned at the old apartment complex
7963000	7966000	where we used to tape this show before we were here.
7966000	7968000	Like, they actually spawned?
7968000	7970000	Yeah, an unknown spawned over there.
7970000	7973000	Well, this is when scanners were working, so people knew that it was there.
7973000	7975000	So it's not that far from here, right?
7975000	7977000	Because we only moved, like, five minutes away, right?
7977000	7979000	So we got in the car and went over there,
7979000	7982000	and I texted one of my friends to say, this is what we're going to do.
7982000	7985000	And my friend was like, log into my account and get it for me.
7985000	7987000	And I was like, all right, I'll do it.
7987000	7988000	So I logged out.
7988000	7990000	Once I caught it, I logged out of my Google.
7990000	7993000	I logged into his Google and then caught it on his account, too.
7993000	7996000	But do they actually spawn unknowns anymore, or is that just...
7996000	7999000	They do, but because the scanners aren't available,
7999000	8001000	they're a lot harder to pinpoint.
8001000	8004000	People don't know where to look for them or find them.
8004000	8007000	So they're out there, especially during special events.
8007000	8009000	They're always out there during special events.
8009000	8011000	Yeah, I need to catch ghost-type Pokémon now.
8011000	8012000	Yeah.
8012000	8015000	ActDeftInChat says, unknowns spawn everywhere.
8015000	8016000	The thing is really hard to find.
8016000	8018000	It's a bummer you didn't go to Capitol Park last week
8018000	8020000	because it was a Duskull nest.
8020000	8021000	So they were everywhere.
8021000	8026000	Look for a Duskull or a Mistrivo nest because those two will nest.
8026000	8028000	I don't know if Shuppets nest.
8028000	8030000	They might, question mark.
8030000	8032000	But Duskull...
8032000	8033000	Gasliesel nest.
8033000	8035000	I remember that was one of the last gen ones.
8035000	8037000	Didn't they have, because I haven't gotten to the point yet
8037000	8039000	where you have to evolve either a Magikarp.
8039000	8041000	What's the other one they want?
8041000	8042000	Magikarp or...
8042000	8045000	You have to catch a Ditto and evolve a Magikarp.
8045000	8046000	I've already caught a Ditto.
8046000	8047000	Okay.
8047000	8048000	I've already done that.
8048000	8050000	There's no other, like, massive candy.
8050000	8053000	Okay, I wasn't sure if it was Magikarp or...
8053000	8054000	No, it's only Magikarp.
8054000	8057000	People are theorizing that in later quests
8057000	8061000	you will have to evolve one of the other 400 candy things
8061000	8064000	like Wailmer or the little bird, Swablu.
8064000	8066000	Yes, because I'm very close to evolving a Swablu.
8066000	8068000	Like, if I need this for, like...
8068000	8069000	I know, right?
8069000	8071000	Maybe I should just hold off because it's garbage anyways, but...
8071000	8072000	Yeah.
8072000	8074000	Okay, ActDeft says, Shuppets do nest.
8074000	8075000	Oh, that's good.
8075000	8080000	sj100mat points out they spawned, like, the Unowns at PAX East and E3.
8080000	8082000	So I'm sure some of the people going to PAX pretty soon
8082000	8084000	will be seeing some of those.
8084000	8086000	By the way, I am going to open the Skype line now.
8086000	8088000	OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype
8088000	8090000	while we finish our Pokemon Go chat.
8090000	8092000	OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.
8092000	8094000	If you want to give us a call and talk about anything
8094000	8096000	we haven't talked about yet or something you want to comment on.
8096000	8099000	sj100mat says Lunatones are also a little random.
8099000	8101000	That's one of the few things I don't have yet.
8101000	8102000	This is fucking Lunatones.
8102000	8103000	Those are hard to find.
8103000	8104000	Those are really hard to find.
8104000	8106000	They spawn downtown, so, like, once in a while
8106000	8108000	you'll see a report in Discord.
8108000	8109000	Which, usually, I'm not looking...
8109000	8111000	I should probably join the Discord.
8111000	8113000	I know, but, God, I'm usually...
8113000	8116000	I'm not looking at it because there's so much there.
8116000	8118000	Like, it's just, like, it's always full.
8118000	8120000	They're always having to prune inactive people.
8120000	8122000	So it's, like, you know, it's, like, full bust at the seams
8122000	8124000	of 2,000 people over on Discord.
8124000	8127000	And it's, like, there's so much noise because of that.
8127000	8130000	I mean, they have it split into 11 billion channels.
8130000	8133000	Like, every neighborhood in Sacramento has their own little,
8133000	8134000	like, subgroup.
8134000	8138000	But then what I find happens is that a lot of the subgroups
8138000	8140000	then split off into their own thing.
8140000	8143000	So the raiders here, instead of using Discord
8143000	8145000	and the channel that was made for this neighborhood,
8145000	8146000	they used GroupMe.
8146000	8149000	So it's, like, I have to have Slack for Ingress.
8149000	8151000	I have to have Discord for other games.
8151000	8153000	I have it for, like, Pokemon Go and stuff.
8153000	8155000	I have to have GroupMe for this.
8155000	8157000	I have to have Telegram, because now a lot of the people
8157000	8159000	that used to use Hangouts and Ingress,
8159000	8160000	now they want to use Telegram.
8160000	8162000	I have to use, like, oh, my God, my folder of, like,
8162000	8165000	chat apps on my phone is fucking disgusting.
8165000	8166000	Anyway.
8166000	8168000	All right, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8168000	8169000	If you want to give us a call,
8169000	8170000	we have a call coming in right now.
8170000	8171000	Let's get to it.
8171000	8172000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8172000	8173000	Who's this?
8173000	8174000	Hey, Robert.
8174000	8175000	It's Regenator.
8175000	8176000	Hey, Regenator.
8176000	8177000	What's on your mind, buddy?
8177000	8179000	Uh, no, no, a whole lot.
8179000	8183000	Um, you know, you know, you know, a quick, you know,
8183000	8186000	gaming-related question, assuming that there's, uh,
8186000	8190000	time after the question, uh, quick PSA.
8190000	8191000	Okay.
8191000	8194000	Uh, subject was brought up towards the beginning of the show.
8194000	8195000	Sure was the question.
8195000	8196000	All right.
8196000	8200000	Now, obviously, uh, everyone doesn't have infinite amount of time
8200000	8202000	and energy to play video games,
8202000	8205000	but we still have an interest in gaming nonetheless.
8205000	8206000	Uh-huh.
8206000	8210000	That being said, when we don't have the time and or energy
8210000	8215000	to play games, do you guys have, uh, an interest in, you know,
8215000	8219000	making use of gaming-related media to kill, uh,
8219000	8221000	kill the time, pass the time?
8221000	8225000	Uh, and if so, what is your favorite media?
8225000	8229000	Gaming-related media to pass the time.
8229000	8230000	Yeah.
8230000	8231000	Interesting.
8231000	8232000	Like YouTubes.
8232000	8234000	Yeah, like, you're listening to, you know, game soundtracks,
8234000	8240000	watching Twitch channels, uh, uh, reading, uh, gaming-themed books.
8240000	8245000	I listen to gaming podcasts, and my very favorite is Orange Lounge Radio
8245000	8247000	at vognetwork.com.
8247000	8249000	It should be the answer everyone's giving.
8249000	8250000	No, I'm just kidding.
8250000	8252000	Uh, but sure, gaming podcasts.
8252000	8253000	Why not?
8253000	8254000	I listen to some in my car.
8254000	8256000	I listen to, like, you know, Game Buoy,
8256000	8258000	and if I miss a week of Bobby Black Wolf, you know,
8258000	8260000	some of the other, you know, gaming-related shows here at VOG Network,
8260000	8261000	I listen to them in my car.
8261000	8262000	So that's a legit answer.
8262000	8264000	Uh, Twitch, absolutely.
8264000	8265000	And it's so funny.
8265000	8268000	You know, I know I was talking about that whole disclaimer about,
8268000	8271000	you know, things change from 15 years ago, uh, to now.
8271000	8274000	Like, I remember there was a time on this show where I was sitting here
8274000	8276000	going, I don't get Twitch.
8276000	8278000	Why is Twitch so fucking popular?
8278000	8279000	Da-da-da-da-da.
8279000	8282000	And now it's like, okay, not only do I stream on Twitch,
8282000	8284000	and I'm an affiliate, but it's one of those things where it's like,
8284000	8288000	yeah, I really do, like, I like to watch people play games on Twitch,
8288000	8289000	like, a lot.
8289000	8291000	It's like a fun little, like, just kind of,
8291000	8293000	especially when they just kind of want to, like, chill out on the couch.
8293000	8295000	Like, it's a good, it's a good, like, background thing.
8295000	8298000	Like, maybe what I'm really doing is I'm on my phone,
8298000	8301000	like, chatting or texting, but then, like, I have Twitch on the TV,
8301000	8303000	and I'm watching somebody play No Man's Sky,
8304000	8306000	or I'm watching him play Final Fantasy XIV,
8306000	8308000	or some other game maybe I haven't played yet,
8308000	8310000	but I want to see if it's any good,
8310000	8314000	or maybe my buddy Delvin, shout out to VG Realness,
8314000	8316000	maybe he's streaming Octopath Traveler,
8316000	8319000	and he's streaming it so much that then I realize,
8319000	8321000	yes, I do need to get this game,
8321000	8324000	and the little a-hole got me to buy this game,
8324000	8327000	Octopath Traveler, because of his streams.
8327000	8331000	So that's, uh, that's, you know, definitely something I do as well.
8331000	8334000	And maybe a little bit of YouTubes here and there,
8334000	8336000	but I think I'm more Twitch than YouTube.
8336000	8338000	I don't watch a lot of the on-demand stuff.
8338000	8339000	Loki, what about you?
8339000	8341000	I don't watch, I mean, gaming stuff,
8341000	8343000	I don't watch a whole ton of people play games.
8343000	8345000	I do a lot of YouTube, though.
8345000	8350000	I watch, um, more, like, tech stuff than anything.
8350000	8352000	I mean, occasionally I'll watch Dunkey.
8352000	8353000	Dunkey's hilarious.
8353000	8358000	Um, other YouTubers, um, what else?
8358000	8360000	Oh, God, I'm trying to think.
8360000	8365000	Ollie43 does a lot of, like, Grand Theft Auto stuff occasionally,
8365000	8368000	and will do Fortnite things and, like, MegaRamps and whatnot.
8368000	8370000	Um, so he's kind of fun to watch.
8370000	8373000	Um, CallMeKevin is another one I watch.
8373000	8374000	He's pretty funny.
8374000	8376000	He does, like, weird stuff in games
8376000	8378000	and has a pretty funny sense of humor.
8378000	8382000	James Ski, but most of his stuff is just, like, garbage in VRChat,
8382000	8384000	and he's just kind of ridiculous.
8384000	8387000	Isn't this interesting that this just goes to show
8387000	8390000	that G4TechTV was always gonna die?
8392000	8394000	I mean, the thing about, because people,
8394000	8397000	it's very similar to, like, the radio, like,
8397000	8399000	and I know I've talked about this on show before,
8399000	8402000	terrestrial radio is dying because of podcasts and stuff.
8402000	8404000	I used to, I mean, I used to,
8404000	8406000	I don't watch, listen to it too much anymore,
8406000	8411000	but I used to listen to a lot of the, uh, Twit stuff,
8411000	8413000	um, you know, and the screensavers,
8413000	8416000	or the new screensavers and all their shows on there,
8416000	8419000	um, like the Android One stuff, I used to listen to that,
8419000	8421000	or This Week in Tech or something like that,
8421000	8423000	or, no, not This Week in Tech, out of their daily show,
8423000	8424000	I don't remember what it's called.
8424000	8427000	Um, but I do that, and then Linus Tech Tips,
8427000	8431000	I watch them, I watch him almost every single day,
8431000	8433000	whatever he releases stuff.
8433000	8435000	By the way, Delvin heard me talking shit,
8435000	8437000	he just joined chat, and he's like,
8437000	8438000	you're welcome.
8438000	8441000	He heard me talking shit, oh no.
8441000	8444000	Uh, quickly, what about you, RageNator?
8444000	8446000	Do you do the Twitch stuff, or what's,
8446000	8448000	answer your own question.
8448000	8452000	Uh, well, I love listening to gaming soundtracks,
8452000	8455000	I, by God knows how many, I mean,
8455000	8457000	you know, if I were to listen to everything,
8457000	8460000	you know, in one big playlist,
8460000	8463000	it would last roughly about a month,
8463000	8465000	you know, with no repeats.
8465000	8467000	Um, you know, in terms of Twitch,
8467000	8470000	I personally don't broadcast all that often,
8471000	8474000	but I do like watching your Twits,
8474000	8477000	I mean, you know, when you or Bobby broadcasts,
8477000	8479000	I'll watch your channels,
8479000	8484000	I'll watch the God Comms main channel,
8484000	8487000	along with their, what's it been called,
8487000	8492000	their guest host individual and personal channels,
8492000	8496000	I'll watch those, and then there's a few cosplayer
8496000	8499000	related channels that I'll watch just for the sake
8499000	8503000	of watching those, so, but that's pretty much it.
8503000	8506000	I mean, everything else.
8506000	8509000	RageNator, I just want to jump in real quick
8509000	8511000	to answer some stuff that's come up in chat.
8511000	8514000	YYR says, terrestrial radio isn't in trouble
8514000	8515000	from podcasts, is it?
8515000	8517000	The top 40 in news radio stations
8517000	8519000	probably aren't impacted too much, are they?
8519000	8521000	I didn't really get to finish my full thought on that,
8521000	8522000	and I've said this before,
8522000	8525000	is that where terrestrial radio is shining best,
8525000	8527000	where the other stuff can't really touch them right now,
8527000	8531000	is local news and local stuff,
8531000	8534000	and there's always going to be that available.
8534000	8536000	As far as top 40 in that goes,
8536000	8537000	I suppose there's always the music
8537000	8539000	that's going to be at the dentist's office,
8539000	8541000	because the radio is always something free
8541000	8544000	that can be turned on at a dentist's office
8544000	8547000	or at stores and stuff, even though many stores
8547000	8549000	have switched to either satellite radio
8549000	8551000	or their own satellite thing,
8551000	8554000	or that's oftentimes delivered through the internet,
8554000	8555000	so that way they can play a song
8555000	8557000	and then have a commercial for what's on sale in your store
8557000	8559000	right there while you're in there.
8559000	8561000	And I think there's another thing there
8561000	8563000	where it's like, if you can't beat them, join them,
8563000	8565000	because Bobby Blackwolf says terrestrial radio
8565000	8568000	is more in trouble from Pandora, Spotify, and so forth.
8568000	8570000	That's why Clear Channel made iHeartRadio.
8570000	8573000	They have an app as well as broadcasting on FM.
8573000	8576000	And yeah, I have to admit, iHeartRadio is pretty cool,
8576000	8578000	because when it comes to the local stuff,
8578000	8581000	one of the things I really like to do on iHeartRadio
8581000	8586000	is that I like to go listen to radio stations in other cities.
8586000	8588000	Like, I think it's kind of fun to listen to, like,
8588000	8590000	the radio stations, like, in New York City
8590000	8592000	or listen to radio stations in Chicago
8592000	8593000	just to kind of get, like, you know,
8593000	8595000	like you're visiting somewhere else or something.
8595000	8597000	I don't know. Am I a nerd? I kind of think that's cool.
8597000	8598000	Yeah, that's neat.
8598000	8602000	Yeah. Anyway. Anyway, quickly, Ray Jare,
8602000	8604000	no other people are trying to get in,
8604000	8606000	but quickly, you said you had some other type of, like, PSA.
8606000	8610000	Yeah. Now, as you mentioned before,
8610000	8615000	you know, someone had recently had, you know,
8615000	8620000	you know, serious complications related to depression.
8620000	8624000	And, you know, personally speaking,
8624000	8627000	I deal with depression myself.
8627000	8632000	The only thing I can say is if you have issues with depression
8632000	8637000	and if you see no hope whatsoever,
8637000	8640000	you're in a lot of pain, so on and so forth,
8640000	8642000	please reach out.
8642000	8645000	Be a therapist, your friends, family,
8645000	8648000	a significant other, whatever.
8648000	8651000	I know. It's tough.
8651000	8654000	I've been there. In fact,
8654000	8657000	I've had an incident last October
8657000	8660000	where I nearly died myself.
8660000	8662000	I know how it feels.
8662000	8664000	But, you know, sometimes it does look bleak,
8664000	8667000	but unless you seek out help,
8667000	8671000	you're not going to find a solution.
8671000	8676000	And trust me, suicide doesn't work.
8676000	8679000	Very well said.
8679000	8681000	A tricky topic.
8681000	8683000	I wasn't really sure how I wanted to approach,
8683000	8687000	and I think Bobby did a very, very good job on his show earlier
8687000	8689000	if you didn't hear the beginning of the show.
8689000	8691000	And I know this has been a topic
8691000	8693000	that's been weighing on a lot of people's minds this week
8693000	8696000	with the fourth anniversary of Robin Williams passing,
8696000	8701000	as well as other things you may or may not be, you know, reading about.
8701000	8706000	But, yeah, I mean, it's hard
8706000	8709000	because I want to give you guys a phone number and say,
8709000	8711000	if you're in trouble, call this number.
8711000	8714000	But I also realize that sometimes when you're struggling
8714000	8717000	and doing that, like, the brain doesn't always,
8717000	8719000	you know, because when you're sick,
8719000	8721000	you know, your body parts don't always do the things
8721000	8723000	that they ought to be doing,
8723000	8725000	and so your brain doesn't think, I need help.
8725000	8727000	I need to pick up the phone. I need to call somebody.
8727000	8730000	So I hope, if nothing else, there's that awareness out there
8730000	8733000	that, you know, no matter who you are or where you're at,
8733000	8735000	there is somebody that fucking cares,
8735000	8738000	and there is somebody, and probably a lot more somebodies
8738000	8740000	than you think in the moment,
8740000	8745000	that want to see you beat the demons of depression
8745000	8748000	and want to see you go and do great things
8748000	8753000	and get over these demons that are holding you back
8753000	8759000	and be able to, you know, live a healthy life and all that.
8759000	8762000	So I hope people feel like, when they're in these moments,
8762000	8764000	just reach out to someone, anyone.
8764000	8766000	And if you feel like there's no one,
8766000	8768000	then there's always going to be these phone numbers and things.
8768000	8771000	But trust me, reach out to a friend.
8771000	8773000	Reach out to a friend you haven't talked to in ten years.
8773000	8774000	Trust me, they'll listen.
8774000	8776000	And if you are that person,
8776000	8779000	it's on the receiving end of one of those things.
8779000	8782000	Not that everybody knows what to do in these situations,
8782000	8783000	but you know what?
8783000	8786000	Sometimes, all somebody needs is somebody to just listen
8786000	8789000	and just say, like, I love you.
8789000	8792000	I care about you. Like, I care.
8792000	8794000	Don't do something to yourself because I care.
8794000	8796000	So, I don't know.
8796000	8797000	Exactly.
8797000	8800000	That's really all the thoughts I can process
8800000	8802000	and put together right now.
8802000	8805000	I just, you know, all you listeners out there right now,
8805000	8807000	somebody cares about you.
8807000	8811000	So don't, even when you're in the shittiest position,
8811000	8815000	please, please, please, don't do anything you'll regret.
8815000	8817000	I don't have all the information,
8817000	8822000	but I'm pretty sure that there is a nationwide hotline
8822000	8825000	that people can call you if you need it.
8825000	8827000	And there's, depending on your locality,
8827000	8831000	there should be a local phone number for you guys,
8831000	8835000	people that call if you want a local phone number.
8835000	8839000	Obviously, I don't have access to everyone's local phone numbers
8839000	8841000	to call for that kind of help,
8841000	8848000	but if you have access to a phone book, look it up.
8848000	8851000	Even if you don't need it for yourself,
8851000	8854000	have it handy just in case you have a friend or relative
8854000	8857000	or neighbor that does need that information.
8857000	8861000	You can say, hey, I see that you're struggling.
8861000	8865000	Here's a phone number that you can call.
8865000	8870000	You can talk to them or you can talk to me, that kind of thing.
8870000	8873000	I'll tell you right now, it's 1-800-273-8255.
8873000	8877000	That's 1-800-273-TALK is the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.
8877000	8882000	That's probably the most well-known of those types of services.
8882000	8886000	But I know, for example, if the issues that you're dealing with
8886000	8892000	are a little more LGBT focused, I know the Trevor Project is huge
8892000	8895000	and a great, wonderful resource to help,
8895000	8902000	and I'm trying to look up their information right now.
8902000	8906000	Pardon me, but this is important as I Google it live as we're here.
8906000	8908000	I believe this is the number here.
8908000	8910000	I hope I'm right because I'm pulling this off of somebody's tweet,
8910000	8912000	but it's 866.
8912000	8913000	Yeah, I don't think that's right.
8913000	8919000	I don't think this is the right number. Sorry, guys.
8919000	8922000	Sorry, guys. This is horrible that I don't know it in the moment here,
8922000	8924000	but I was not prepared.
8924000	8926000	Luckily, okay, I found their official website.
8926000	8929000	Here it is, 1-866-488-7386.
8929000	8931000	Again, that's a little more geared for youths.
8931000	8936000	So if you're a youth facing serious LGBTQ-related issues and you need help,
8936000	8939000	1-866-488-7386 is the Trevor Project.
8939000	8944000	Again, I also understand that giving a number is only so much.
8944000	8950000	If nothing else, call anyone. Call anyone.
8950000	8952000	Don't battle it alone.
8952000	8954000	I guess that's all I can really say.
8954000	8959000	Yeah, as long as you get help in one form or another,
8959000	8963000	be it a call, go see a therapist in person,
8963000	8965000	speak to a relative in person,
8965000	8970000	or have lunch with a friend that you haven't seen in a while.
8970000	8975000	Something, as long as you don't keep them all shut
8975000	8981000	and just try to put on a brave face for everyone.
8981000	8984000	I've had the mentality before of,
8984000	8987000	oh, yeah, I'll put on a brave face and pretend nothing's wrong,
8987000	8991000	not to be a burden on everyone else.
8991000	8994000	That only makes things worse.
8994000	8997000	Just seek help in whatever way you can.
8997000	8998000	Well said.
8998000	9000000	And I think on that note, I'm going to let you go
9000000	9002000	so we can try to get some more calls,
9002000	9005000	but I think that was a PSA worth our time, so thank you very much.
9005000	9006000	Take care.
9006000	9007000	Have a nice night.
9007000	9008000	You too. Bye-bye.
9008000	9011000	Orange Launch Radio, all one word if you want to give us a call.
9011000	9013000	Orange Launch Radio, all one word if you want to give us a call
9013000	9018000	and chat about whatever's going on in gaming or what have you this week.
9018000	9020000	Wow, phones are on fire tonight.
9020000	9021000	Let's get to it.
9021000	9023000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9023000	9024000	Hey, this is Ronmo.
9024000	9026000	Hey, Ronmo. What's up, buddy?
9026000	9027000	Not much.
9027000	9029000	I feel like I'm stuck in a bit of a predicament
9029000	9032000	because I'm kind of following up with that call,
9032000	9034000	so now I got to bring the funny now.
9034000	9037000	No, we're resetting the palette.
9037000	9040000	Do you want to tell a dick joke or a fart joke?
9042000	9046000	No, not really, but I just want to know.
9046000	9050000	We need to stop calling this OLR at this rate, Ron.
9050000	9053000	We need to start calling it Nostalgic Lounge Radio.
9053000	9055000	Why is that?
9055000	9058000	I don't know. It just seems like almost once in a month
9058000	9060000	we talk about the good times, and I love it,
9060000	9065000	and we have to remind people that OLR is not just a podcast.
9065000	9068000	We're a family, and as you were saying,
9068000	9071000	and I was coming home from my trip this weekend,
9071000	9078000	how the podcast keeps you going and how everything goes and so forth,
9078000	9081000	and it got me to thinking how you guys are there for me,
9081000	9084000	especially you and my times of need.
9084000	9087000	Well, thank you. Happy to do so.
9087000	9089000	That's what friends are for, as they say.
9089000	9090000	Absolutely.
9090000	9093000	You know, it's interesting, though, because you kind of joke about
9093000	9096000	how every other episode ends up being a reminiscing episode,
9096000	9100000	but I think it's come out of our mouths several times tonight,
9100000	9101000	phrases such as,
9101000	9104000	if we don't learn from the past, we're doomed to repeat it.
9104000	9107000	We also have talked about how emulation
9107000	9111000	and remembering the past of gaming, like, there is something relevant there.
9111000	9113000	We do talk about the good old days. Why?
9113000	9116000	Because there were some damn fucking good games in those good old days
9116000	9120000	and things we'd like to see again and things that we hope don't go away,
9120000	9122000	hence me reminiscing about The Guardian legend
9122000	9125000	and how that is a very hard game to play legally
9125000	9128000	in this day and age in the year 2018.
9128000	9131000	So does this mean I have to track down another game pack for you?
9131000	9133000	Your mic is cutting out a little bit.
9133000	9135000	I don't know if your mic moved away from your mouth.
9136000	9137000	Try again?
9137000	9140000	I said, do I have to track down another copy of the game for you?
9140000	9143000	No, no, no, we're good there. I'm fine, but I'm talking about other people
9143000	9145000	because I sit here on the show and go,
9145000	9147000	y'all need to play Guardian legend and see what I keep talking about.
9147000	9150000	It's not easy for everybody to just do that, you know what I mean?
9150000	9154000	I can't be like, go on virtual console and get, yeah, I can't even do that.
9154000	9155000	I mean, I get it.
9155000	9159000	I'm one of those who went to those sites to pull those games
9159000	9163000	because there was a lot of awesome Japanese games that came out
9163000	9169000	for the Super NES and Genesis slash Mega Drive that never came this way.
9169000	9172000	And this was our way of playing them.
9172000	9175000	But at the same time, I get the legality of it.
9175000	9178000	And I had a brief tweet about this.
9178000	9180000	Somebody was like, look at Discotek.
9180000	9184000	They're going out of their way to track down this anime series.
9184000	9185000	I forget which one it is.
9185000	9189000	They're going through Sony to get the master tapes
9189000	9191000	and all that to do the series.
9191000	9196000	Meanwhile, ROM preservation sites are being shut down.
9196000	9198000	And I said, there's a difference.
9198000	9205000	Discotek is contacting the manufacturers of the anime to get the tapes.
9205000	9210000	These companies, I mean, these sites that are preserving ROM games
9210000	9213000	are just grabbing them and throwing them up there.
9213000	9216000	They're not contacting the company for permission to host these
9216000	9219000	because they know they're going to be told, no, you can't do that.
9219000	9220000	Pull them down.
9221000	9226000	But it's not going to matter because it's going to go on the ground.
9226000	9228000	There are torrent sites.
9228000	9232000	There are torrents right now where you can just get every single Nintendo game.
9232000	9237000	I understand that they file a lawsuit and stuff,
9237000	9241000	but don't they also have just the DMCA requests and stuff that they can just do?
9241000	9244000	I don't even know why we have to go through a whole lawsuit thing
9244000	9247000	other than, oh, we're going to make an example of them
9247000	9249000	telling them that emulation is wrong.
9249000	9253000	They can put a DMCA request in, and if they don't comply with that,
9253000	9255000	then they can file a lawsuit.
9255000	9261000	But I see a lot of these sites put that as, hey, yeah, you can report your stuff,
9261000	9264000	and then we'll take it down if that's the issue.
9264000	9266000	I mean, I don't know.
9266000	9273000	The thing is these sites are saying that we host these as preservation and archive.
9273000	9275000	That's their way around it.
9275000	9277000	We all know it's not an archive.
9277000	9281000	And besides, with the DMCA, the site, their repository may be shut down.
9281000	9285000	They'll just go to another hoster or another bunch of drop boxes and Google drives
9285000	9288000	and re-upload all the files.
9288000	9290000	Yep.
9290000	9294000	Hey, Rama, you know what one of my very favorite Super Nintendo games is ever?
9294000	9295000	What?
9295000	9296000	It's a game called Equinox.
9296000	9299000	It was the sequel to a game called Solstice on the NES
9299000	9302000	that was a very unique kind of 3D perspective.
9302000	9305000	It had some great music, and it was a really challenging, fun little game.
9305000	9306000	Here's the thing.
9306000	9309000	You will never, well, never say never, I guess,
9309000	9313000	but it is highly unlikely you will ever be able to play that game through legal channels.
9313000	9316000	And I'm going to have to tell you, if you want to go play that game,
9316000	9317000	you're going to have to go download it.
9317000	9319000	You either have to find the cartridge, which is going to be hard to find
9319000	9321000	because I don't think they made a lot of copies of that game,
9321000	9322000	or you're going to have to go download the ROM.
9322000	9323000	And you know why?
9323000	9324000	You know why I have to tell you?
9324000	9326000	Because it's never going to be out for you to play legally.
9326000	9327000	Do you know why that is?
9327000	9328000	Why?
9328000	9329000	Because of the publisher.
9329000	9330000	It was Sony.
9330000	9332000	Well, there you go.
9332000	9335000	Remember when Sony and Super Nintendo were making Nice Nice for a hot minute there?
9335000	9339000	Because there was almost a Nintendo PlayStation?
9339000	9341000	Yeah, the Sony CSG Soft.
9341000	9342000	Yeah.
9342000	9347000	So Equinox was one of those games when Sony Image Soft,
9347000	9348000	I think it was called at the time,
9348000	9352000	or at least their video game publishing thing was,
9352000	9353000	and Nintendo were making Nice Nice.
9353000	9354000	Anyway.
9354000	9357000	Rama, I got to wrap up because we got some more calls coming in.
9357000	9358000	I want to try to get to everybody tonight.
9358000	9361000	So any other quick thoughts before I let you go?
9361000	9362000	No, that's it.
9362000	9365000	And if you don't mind if I show my podcast real quick?
9365000	9366000	Of course.
9366000	9367000	Please.
9367000	9368000	Awesome.
9368000	9372000	We're going to be talking about Otacon 2018 tomorrow on Tuesday on Anime Jam Session.
9372000	9375000	You don't have anything to say about that.
9375000	9376000	Maybe.
9376000	9382000	I'll talk about my big purchase of the console.
9382000	9383000	Okay.
9383000	9384000	Cool.
9384000	9385000	All right.
9385000	9387000	Check out Anime Jam Session Tuesday nights here at VOG.
9387000	9388000	Do it.
9388000	9389000	Yas, queen.
9389000	9390000	All right.
9390000	9392000	Good night, my friend.
9392000	9393000	Bye.
9393000	9394000	Bye.
9394000	9396000	Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype.
9396000	9398000	I see some more folks trying to get through.
9398000	9399000	Please keep trying.
9399000	9401000	I'm going to really try to get to everybody tonight.
9401000	9402000	Hi.
9402000	9403000	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
9403000	9404000	Who's this?
9404000	9405000	Hey.
9405000	9406000	This is SSJ1 and you're Matt.
9406000	9407000	So good to hear from you, Matt.
9407000	9409000	What's on your mind?
9409000	9410000	Not much.
9410000	9412000	I wanted to talk about it.
9412000	9414000	You guys might have brought it up earlier.
9414000	9416000	I might have stepped away.
9416000	9421000	But I wanted to get your thoughts on how Pokemon Go Community Weekend was for you.
9421000	9422000	You know what?
9422000	9423000	Thank you for asking.
9423000	9427000	Because when I talked about my gaming week, I completely neglected to talk about it.
9427000	9428000	I did as well.
9428000	9429000	I forgot.
9429000	9430000	Okay.
9430000	9431000	So no, you didn't miss it.
9431000	9432000	Here's the thing.
9432000	9433000	We just played it so much.
9433000	9434000	I know.
9434000	9435000	Honestly.
9435000	9439000	Can I forget every week to mention, oh yeah, I played Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme too.
9439000	9442000	So I played so much Pokemon Go today that I'm actually kind of sick of it.
9442000	9443000	So here's the thing.
9443000	9447000	Because of the other stuff I had going on yesterday, I didn't really get to participate
9447000	9448000	in the Saturday day.
9448000	9451000	So I actually kind of love that it was two days this weekend.
9451000	9455000	And I know they also did that because of the number of Eeveelutions that there are.
9455000	9458000	I wish they would just do it for like more than three hours.
9458000	9459000	But I did.
9459000	9460000	Well, they did this weekend.
9460000	9462000	They did three hours Saturday, three hours Sunday.
9462000	9463000	Six hours.
9463000	9464000	I know.
9464000	9465000	I know.
9465000	9466000	I know.
9466000	9467000	But anyway.
9467000	9468000	All day.
9468000	9469000	Anyway.
9469000	9472000	So I caught one shiny Eevee yesterday because I have this little Bluetooth.
9472000	9474000	It's not a Pokemon Go Plus, but it's a Gotcha.
9474000	9477000	So I think a lot of you players know what that is.
9477000	9478000	So I have a Gotcha.
9478000	9483000	And between like the freeway and Melody's house, because I wanted to spin some of the
9483000	9484000	stops.
9484000	9488000	I got a shiny Eevee somehow because it was right about 1130 when I was getting over to
9488000	9489000	Melody's house.
9489000	9491000	So I caught a shiny Eevee on Saturday.
9491000	9494000	Today, I went down to Capitol Park, as I usually do.
9494000	9495000	It's one of the big hotspots here.
9495000	9497000	And I went and I.
9497000	9501000	So if you all are getting gifts, they're like Sacramento State Capitol or it's because that's
9501000	9504000	where I like to play.
9504000	9513000	So I went down there today and in the first two hours, I caught one and I was like, oh
9513000	9515000	God, this is how this day is going to go.
9515000	9521000	And meanwhile, Shane being Shane is like, yeah, I caught 10 yesterday and I'm up to
9521000	9522000	six today.
9522000	9524000	I'm just like, I hate him.
9524000	9525000	I fucking hate him.
9525000	9526000	How does he have all this shiny luck?
9526000	9528000	Does he have a shiny charm?
9528000	9529000	Anyway.
9529000	9530000	But so here's the thing.
9530000	9532000	So I started joking with my friends that I was walking with.
9532000	9535000	I was like, man, I'm not going to get any shiny.
9535000	9537000	Pokemon Go is lame anyway.
9537000	9538000	I don't care.
9538000	9539000	Nobody plays this game anymore.
9539000	9540000	I don't need shinies.
9540000	9542000	So I was kind of like doing that whole thing.
9542000	9545000	Like I wasn't serious, but I was, you know, kind of doing that whole thing.
9545000	9546000	And then I shit you not.
9546000	9551000	After my complaining fest, we start walking from where we're at to Starbucks to get a
9551000	9552000	drink because it's kind of hot here right now.
9552000	9556000	I caught in the scope of 20 minutes and I'm not exaggerating this.
9556000	9560000	Six shiny EVs in 20 minutes.
9560000	9564000	Like it got to the point where like I pull up the first one.
9564000	9565000	I'm like, oh, haha.
9565000	9566000	Complaining works.
9566000	9567000	I got another one.
9567000	9568000	I pull up the second one.
9568000	9569000	Wow.
9569000	9570000	Complaining really works.
9570000	9571000	I pull up the third one.
9571000	9574000	Hey guys, maybe you want to start complaining loudly about the game too because there's
9574000	9575000	something to this.
9575000	9579000	And like as we're standing in line at Starbucks, I'm tapping on the EVs at Starbucks.
9579000	9581000	I catch two while we're at Starbucks.
9581000	9585000	I show my friends my phone and they're like, what the fuck, dude?
9586000	9587000	What are you doing?
9587000	9589000	And I'm like, I don't know.
9589000	9592000	Like even I admit this is ridiculous.
9592000	9593000	Yeah.
9593000	9596000	So I ended the whole event with eight shiny EVs and so I was very happy.
9596000	9600000	Now, of course, I started evolving all but two because obviously I'm going to walk the
9600000	9602000	two so I get Espeon and Umbreon.
9602000	9610000	And of course, as I evolve them, I get three Flareons and two, three Flareons and two Vaporeons.
9610000	9611000	No Jolteons.
9611000	9612000	Yeah.
9612000	9616000	But that's why they do trading because my friend really wanted a Vaporeon and he got
9616000	9617000	four Jolteons.
9617000	9620000	So that's what trading is for.
9620000	9623000	So, yeah, no, like my weekend was kind of similar.
9623000	9630000	Like the first day, like I caught, I only got like one or two in the first hour, first
9630000	9631000	two and a half hours.
9631000	9635000	The last half hour of it, I caught six after that.
9635000	9636000	Okay.
9636000	9637000	So you had similar luck.
9637000	9638000	Yeah.
9638000	9639000	Yes.
9639000	9640000	Yes.
9640000	9641000	Similar luck.
9641000	9643000	Somewhat similar too.
9643000	9646000	Like I caught ten today and previously I caught eight.
9646000	9647000	Wow.
9647000	9650000	So you have enough EVs to start thinking about gen four stuff.
9650000	9654000	See, that's my problem is I can't really think about gen four because I barely have
9654000	9657000	enough to get me through gens one, two and three, you know?
9657000	9658000	Yeah.
9658000	9659000	Yeah.
9659000	9664000	And I know this is like they've, so people have kind of been saying like there's a
9664000	9670000	maybe a little bit of method to the shinies popping up saying like, oh, if you click on
9670000	9675000	the first, the one that pops up, you get you, you're more likely to get a shiny.
9675000	9680000	There's other talk of people saying like if you go into a less densely populated area,
9680000	9682000	you're more apt to get more shinies.
9682000	9688000	I can confirm that that's bullshit all around because I got zero shinies and I was playing
9688000	9693000	in very undense populated areas and I played for a long time and I got jack shit.
9693000	9694000	Yeah.
9694000	9699000	So I don't know if there's anything to that, but no.
9699000	9705000	So I kind of like them doing this whole weekend thing because I think it just works for everybody's
9705000	9706000	schedule.
9706000	9711000	It's like, so I'm curious what they're going to do for the next one because you know, we
9711000	9714000	were getting like Bulbasaur, Charmander or Squirtle.
9714000	9721000	So, you know, the obvious choice for the next community day would be Chikorita, right?
9721000	9723000	Gen two is grass starter, right?
9723000	9724000	Yeah.
9724000	9725000	They were, yeah.
9725000	9727000	The things that I was reading, it's like, it could be like Ralts.
9727000	9729000	It could be like Chikorita could be Totodile.
9729000	9730000	Yeah.
9730000	9731000	It could be anything really.
9731000	9737000	And I wonder could they, could they unveil gen four starting during the community day?
9737000	9740000	Well, they were supposed, the thought was that they were going to do that this time,
9740000	9741000	but they didn't.
9741000	9742000	Yeah.
9742000	9749000	Well, I saw like a weird tweet go out about how they're kind of starting to promote Celebi
9749000	9753000	as you know, the next mythical research.
9753000	9754000	Mm hmm.
9754000	9758000	Well, because actually, um, Shane already has a Celebi because he went to go fest.
9758000	9761000	So all the people who went to go fest got to do the quest there.
9761000	9762000	Yeah.
9762000	9763000	Yeah.
9763000	9765000	So I think they're kind of maybe getting towards that.
9765000	9766000	Yeah.
9766000	9769000	I think, like, I think the Celebi quests are going to, like, they're going to pull the
9769000	9771000	curtain back on that in the next couple of weeks.
9771000	9772000	I really think so.
9772000	9774000	Uh, obviously we know we're getting Reggie rock next week.
9774000	9777000	Um, so I think Celebi will come soon after that.
9777000	9779000	Probably, you know, close enough to Labor Day.
9779000	9783000	I'm curious if there's going to be an event going on over Labor Day weekend, but I think
9783000	9788000	that is when Japan has their, cause you know, Europe had an event, the U S had an event.
9788000	9792000	I think Japan's event is over Labor Day weekend and that's going to be interesting cause I'll
9792000	9796000	be at dragon con, but that is when shiny wingle is expected to debut.
9796000	9797000	Yeah.
9797000	9804000	So I, so I wondered like, so they, so Niantic did a little cross promotion thing with Paxi,
9804000	9805000	with Paxis.
9805000	9809000	They had pretty much unknowns drop all around the Harbor area.
9809000	9810000	Mm hmm.
9810000	9815000	And then E3, they had, uh, unknowns drop around there.
9815000	9820000	So I wonder, like, it could be possible they could do it at a dragon con.
9820000	9822000	I would love it if they did it at dragon con.
9822000	9826000	I don't know if they will cause dragon con is, if I remember right, Bobby, correct me
9826000	9830000	if I'm wrong, but I think dragon con is still a hundred percent fan run and it seems like
9830000	9834000	it's more the commercial stuff that gets the big, uh, unknowns like comic con and packs
9834000	9839000	and stuff are all, you know, cause remember the guys at Pax sold Pax expo a while ago.
9839000	9843000	Uh, so because dragon con is still fan run, they probably don't exactly know who to call
9843000	9844000	it Niantic.
9844000	9850000	Uh, but I know, uh, our buddy Charles from the Pokemon go podcast, who is a big part
9850000	9852000	of the podcasting track at dragon con.
9852000	9854000	A big part of the reason why I'm able to do as much as I am.
9854000	9855000	So a big thanks to him.
9855000	9858000	Uh, I, I know he's pushing for that and he would love that.
9858000	9859000	So I, I don't know.
9859000	9860000	We'll see.
9860000	9864000	I would love it if dragon con would get the unknowns, but I'm not, not going to hold my
9864000	9865000	breath.
9865000	9869000	And, uh, Bobby black golf also theorizing Niantic is probably doing it with packs prime
9869000	9870000	or packs west.
9870000	9874000	I guess they stopped calling it packs prime packs west because it's at the same time.
9874000	9875000	That's right.
9875000	9876000	Yep.
9876000	9877000	That I could, I, you know what?
9877000	9878000	I believe that.
9878000	9879000	All right.
9879000	9881000	Well to my number six best friend, I'm going to have to let you go.
9881000	9883000	I just, I just checked my list.
9883000	9884000	So here's the current ranking.
9884000	9890000	My, my buddy Kyle in Toronto is the only person that I have exchanged or done a gift with
9890000	9892000	every single day since this rolled out.
9892000	9893000	So he's my number one.
9893000	9895000	Act deft is number two.
9895000	9896000	Ooh.
9896000	9898000	My old roommate, John is number three.
9898000	9901000	Uh, one of my ingress buddies is number four, a Panda, we call him.
9901000	9903000	And then Loki's number five.
9903000	9904000	And then you're number six.
9904000	9906000	And I, and I just friended Loki.
9906000	9910000	So now, so now I can kind of stagger that, uh, friend bonus.
9910000	9911000	Nice.
9911000	9916000	But I'm sure some, I'm sure someday we'll, we'll be able to do trades as best friends.
9916000	9917000	Yes.
9917000	9918000	That'll, that'll be great.
9918000	9919000	That's the whole reason to do it.
9919000	9920000	Yeah, for sure.
9920000	9923000	Um, the thing about shinies, they cost an arm and a leg to trade.
9923000	9926000	If you don't have them, they, they, they go with the legendary costs.
9926000	9929000	So if you're not three or four star friends, forget it.
9929000	9930000	Yeah.
9930000	9931000	All right.
9931000	9932000	All right.
9932000	9933000	My friend, I'm gonna let you go.
9933000	9934000	All right.
9934000	9935000	Take care.
9935000	9936000	Take care.
9936000	9937000	Thank you.
9937000	9938000	Yep.
9938000	9939000	Well, weren't they supposed to be doing, um, like some sort of treating one more chance
9939000	9940000	to get in.
9940000	9941000	I saw somebody else calling.
9941000	9942000	I'd really love to get on it.
9942000	9943000	One more chance to get an orange.
9943000	9946000	I was going to cost less to do trades for awhile.
9946000	9949000	They are doing an event right now where you get more candy from it.
9949000	9954000	Oh, so like I traded somebody today, like I had a slack off that I caught in Chicago
9954000	9958000	and I traded it for just another slack off so we could get thousands of kilometers of
9958000	9959000	distance.
9959000	9965000	And I got six slack off candies, which was all I needed to evolve my, uh, slacking my,
9965000	9968000	what, which is actually my second slacking, but this one is appraised as a wonder.
9968000	9970000	So it's going to be a better slacking.
9970000	9971000	Mm hmm.
9971000	9974000	So cause those, those guys are kind of Jim beasts.
9974000	9975000	So that's kind of fun.
9975000	9979000	S2100 Matt says they did have that event where it was 25% less starters to trade.
9979000	9981000	I didn't even really, I must've missed it.
9981000	9982000	I haven't been doing a lot of trading.
9982000	9985000	Today was actually the first day I got a lucky Pokemon.
9985000	9987000	I have not gotten one of those either.
9987000	9990000	The only, and it was a, what did I trade for it?
9990000	9992000	I gave him something.
9992000	9994000	Oh, we did a distance trade.
9994000	10001000	So, so there's a buddy in, um, Australia that I have and uh, let me, um, high collar.
10001000	10002000	I'll get to you in just a minute.
10002000	10007000	So, um, there's a, there's a friend that I have in Australia that I think is a listener to the show.
10007000	10009000	So shout out to a Clover Nikon if you're there.
10009000	10013000	So, uh, he sends presents from Australia.
10013000	10018000	So I opened an egg cause the eggs are attached to where your friends are when they send them to you.
10018000	10020000	So this egg was Australia.
10020000	10022000	So my friend today was like, Oh, I want to trade for distance.
10022000	10025000	And I'm like, Oh, well I have this, you know, it's just a Sandshrew or something.
10025000	10026000	It wasn't something I need to hang onto.
10026000	10028000	So I'm like, I have this Sandshrew, but it's from Australia.
10028000	10031000	So if you don't have your bronze medal yet, you'll get it off this.
10031000	10033000	It's going to be like thousands of kilometers.
10033000	10037000	So, uh, he gave me the Arcanine or whatever that thing is called.
10037000	10041000	He gave me that Arcanine. No, that would be a spider Arcanine.
10041000	10044000	So, um, uh, he traded that.
10044000	10047000	He's just like, I just have this throwaway thing from like Costa Mesa when I was on a trip.
10047000	10049000	So we traded that.
10049000	10055000	And when that came over, not only did the stats go up so that it was a wonder for me, it was high appraisal,
10055000	10057000	but then it was a lucky Pokemon.
10057000	10060000	So I know those fire, they're fire dark doggies.
10060000	10063000	They're not like the greatest Pokemon, but they're not, they don't suck.
10063000	10066000	Like they're, they're, they'll hold their own in raids if you need them.
10066000	10068000	Anyway, I got a call or I'm making wait.
10068000	10070000	So let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Mountain Radio. Who's this?
10070000	10074000	Hi, it's YYR trying to be very quiet.
10074000	10077000	No, I know you have a new baby.
10077000	10079000	So, uh, congrats and everything.
10079000	10085000	Your, your baby is not that far apart in age from the baby I went to visit yesterday who just hit three months.
10085000	10088000	So, so what's up buddy?
10088000	10097000	Oh, well, I mean, first of all, I just want to let any prospective parents know it is a lot.
10097000	10099000	It's a lot of work.
10099000	10101000	It's a lot to have to handle.
10101000	10104000	Loki is not all the, you know, shiny rainbows and all that.
10104000	10107000	So Loki doesn't get better when the kids get turned seven years old.
10107000	10112000	No, it gets different, right?
10112000	10113000	They just whine more.
10113000	10118000	They whine more. They're able to verbalize their problems a lot more.
10118000	10123000	Yeah. Everyone just says it gets better. It gets better. I'm convinced it probably just gets different.
10123000	10124000	It gets better.
10124000	10125000	At least until, you know, they turn 18.
10125000	10129000	Yeah. I was like, it gets better when they turn 18 and they move out.
10129000	10132000	My wife is nodding.
10132000	10135000	No, but I think it's great. You guys made a child. That's amazing.
10135000	10141000	You know, kids aren't for everyone. Alan and I decided a long time ago it's not for us, but we love cats and we have cats.
10141000	10144000	Hey, if you can come to an agreement, that's the best thing.
10144000	10146000	Absolutely. Absolutely.
10146000	10152000	So I know you didn't just want to talk about babies solely tonight. What else did you want to talk about?
10152000	10158000	Well, first of all, the Bethesda Sony thing that you touched on earlier.
10158000	10159000	Yeah.
10160000	10173000	So I really think that Sony is in one of those sorts of positions where, you know, doubling down, they think, is going to look better to them than changing course.
10173000	10177000	I don't know why I get that impression, but that's just the impression that I get.
10177000	10186000	I have a feeling that they would rather double down than say, oh, you know, we're going to reverse position and play nice with everybody now.
10186000	10189000	I don't know why I feel that way, but I just, that's the feeling that I get.
10189000	10194000	Yeah, but the problem is it bit Microsoft in the butt eventually. It's going to bite Sony in the butt eventually, too.
10194000	10200000	I know, I know, you know, because we were talking a little bit in the chat and so forth, and I know, you know, guys on Twitter are whatever.
10200000	10211000	It's not a big deal, but it's like, you know, when you start hearing more stories like this, when the press starts doing more reporting, when the business journal is asking Resi Fizame about, you know, this stuff.
10211000	10221000	I think it is starting to hit the mainstream press, like that noise is going to come to a point and it is going to start to affect Sony when they start talking about things like PlayStation 5.
10221000	10229000	You know, that's, that's when Microsoft really had to pay the piper was that people really shredded them when it came to the Xbox One. You know what I mean?
10229000	10230000	So if Sony doesn't kind of...
10230000	10236000	Yeah, I mean, it may, but you're also comparing Xbox with PlayStation and here's the thing.
10236000	10244000	So Microsoft had to really claw and tear their way to where they got with the 360.
10244000	10257000	As it is worldwide, even at the height of the 360's popularity, PlayStation was still much more popular in Europe, much more popular in Asia.
10257000	10265000	And, you know, they basically have the dominant world position when it comes to gaming as a brand.
10265000	10275000	I don't think there, any bad will that comes from this, I don't think it would hurt them as much as it would hurt Microsoft in the long run.
10275000	10284000	I think that they have enough loyal players, loyal fans that this is barely going to register on their radar.
10284000	10293000	I would, you know what, I will concede this point because you do bring up a really good point about the global market and Microsoft doesn't matter in Japan.
10293000	10297000	There are not, I get that the Xbox One is sold there, it's a non-issue in Japan.
10297000	10301000	So Sony can get away with this in Japan a hundred percent.
10301000	10303000	Sony can get away with this a hundred percent.
10303000	10313000	But I mean, but also now we're talking about the Nintendo Switch and PC and I think as the Switch starts to grow, if the Switch can kind of cross play with some things, I mean, I don't know.
10313000	10317000	It's going to be interesting. I still think it's going to kind of come to a point eventually.
10317000	10323000	Especially if Sony just kind of continues this sort of attitude that led to this decision.
10323000	10333000	You know, I think that's also part of what really defeated Microsoft is that they kind of went in there unveiling the Xbox One thinking we're going to do all these things that the gamers want.
10333000	10337000	And it was just, it was just too early and it was really miss sold.
10337000	10341000	I think they had, we all know they had a horrible person at home.
10342000	10347000	Yeah, at the end of the day though, it's like, okay, so the PS4 has no backwards compatibility.
10347000	10350000	So you still can't change your name on PSN.
10350000	10355000	So, I mean, there's a lot of ways, services where Microsoft exceeds Sony.
10355000	10364000	It doesn't matter. PlayStation 4 has the exclusives and, you know, the global fan base.
10364000	10368000	And once again, it's there in the position of dominance right now.
10368000	10372000	And I don't think they need to worry about these things as much if they don't want to.
10372000	10383000	I mean, yeah, it would be the nice friendly, player friendly thing to do to open up their this and that and the other thing and to add all those features I mentioned.
10383000	10394000	But, I mean, unless someone lights a fire under them and I don't think it's going to be Nintendo because I'm still convinced that the Switch is not direct competition to the PS4.
10394000	10398000	So, no, I don't, I don't think that either.
10398000	10404000	But I think, I think ultimately it's going to be companies like Bethesda over here that are going to end up lighting that fire.
10404000	10408000	And, you know, sure, you know, the card game is whatever.
10408000	10410000	It's not going to be something that affects a ton of people.
10410000	10420000	But when it's Street Fighter 5, you know, or Street Fighter 6, should I say, or, or whatever, like Fortnite 2, or even as Loki says, very tongue in cheek Minecraft 2.
10420000	10424000	Although that's a whole nother issue since we all know Microsoft runs the Minecraft ship now.
10424000	10430000	I think they would do very well to, to conveniently not release on Sony's platform for a few months.
10430000	10431000	I think they would.
10431000	10433000	I'm sorry, it's just, you know, that's business.
10433000	10437000	Wanted to do, you know, cross play and you just want to play.
10437000	10444000	But anyway, all right, I do, I do still appreciate your viewpoint, your thoughts, especially, you know, you do bring us some very good points with the global market.
10444000	10446000	I think sometimes we forget.
10446000	10448000	So, yeah, I mean, we'll see how this plays out.
10448000	10454000	I think, yeah, I'm excited as a spectator to see how, how this plays out, how all of it goes and what happens.
10454000	10455000	For sure.
10455000	10457000	All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up though.
10457000	10460000	But take care and it's always, it's good as always to hear from you.
10460000	10462000	Hey, no problem.
10462000	10464000	I'll just mention one quick thing on the way out.
10464000	10465000	Yeah, yeah.
10466000	10472000	I'm not making any official announcements yet, but I've started working on bungee ferret tossing again.
10472000	10475000	You may or may not see it on Steam before the end of the year.
10475000	10476000	Yay!
10476000	10477000	That makes me excited.
10477000	10481000	Yeah, you can always put it on a Discord Steam store there.
10481000	10482000	Also.
10482000	10483000	Don't pay money.
10483000	10490000	I have noticed that super multitasking has been getting some updates and, you know, I read your changelog and I can see what you're kind of doing.
10490000	10492000	You've kind of going back and addressing a few things.
10492000	10497000	You obviously have been distracted for a few months by the baby, which everybody completely understands and respects.
10497000	10507000	But, you know, as a super multitasking fan, I was very excited to see, ooh, they're still making, Aaron's in there making updates again.
10507000	10508000	That's awesome.
10508000	10515000	Yeah, I mean, honestly, most of it is just to fix something that was, ugh, the whole thing was frustrating.
10515000	10524000	Long story very short, a third-party library that I used for the Steam support, leaderboards, stats, and so on, it broke.
10524000	10531000	And they basically didn't provide any support, so I had to redo the Steam support from scratch using a totally different library.
10531000	10534000	Yikes. Well, you got it, though. Congrats.
10534000	10540000	My one request, though, before you put out bungee ferret tossing on Steam, which you may or may not be confirming right now.
10540000	10543000	Please let me submit a picture of Mr. Smoosh for inclusion.
10543000	10546000	Oh, yes, the call will go out for more pet pictures.
10546000	10550000	Okay, amazing. All right. All right, my friend, I'm gonna let you go. Best of luck.
10550000	10551000	Have a great week, guys.
10551000	10552000	You, too. Bye.
10552000	10553000	Thank you.
10553000	10556000	All right, that is gonna do it for the Skypline tonight. Thanks so much to all the callers.
10556000	10560000	But if you didn't get through for whatever reason, it's, we're after nine o'clock, I gotta wrap up.
10560000	10564000	But if you didn't get through for whatever reason, please feel free to send us a tweet at OLR.
10564000	10568000	You can always email us, of course. Participate at orangelaunchradio.com.
10568000	10574000	Sj100matt pointing out tonight's calls were off in the state of New York. All four callers were from New York tonight. That's very true.
10574000	10582000	Do you know, that goes back to the live 365 days when you could see, like, what markets, like, number one was always Sacramento, obviously,
10582000	10585000	because that's where the show is based and where all our friends are that we were telling about the show.
10585000	10590000	But the number two market for this show is, like, almost always been New York, which I find.
10590000	10596000	I always just kind of was like, well, it's, you know, New York City is a big city, of course, but no, you guys are awesome.
10596000	10602000	All of you are awesome, though, no matter where you live, where you're from. International listenership is amazing as well.
10602000	10606000	Met so many, so many people around the world. All right, anyway, we gotta wrap up for the night.
10606000	10610000	Thank you guys so much. I did not even check if there's any last minute stories, but at this point.
10610000	10614000	I was just gonna mention one thing I saw here. Quake Champions went free to play.
10614000	10616000	Oh, yeah, I did hear about that. That was other news.
10616000	10621000	So they have an option where they're gonna rotate out a certain champion that'll be free,
10621000	10628000	and then you can unlock more by earning the favor in matches, or I think you can also pay to unlock stuff too.
10628000	10634000	Nice. All right. Well, we're gonna wrap it up here at Orange Launch Radio, but if you enjoyed what you heard here at the show tonight,
10634000	10639000	please tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
10639000	10643000	but if the voices aren't here to air, then what are we gonna say? Nothing.
10643000	10647000	So anyway, please help us spread the word. A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes,
10647000	10651000	or wherever it is that you heard about this program. Those reviews go a very long way,
10651000	10655000	and I really do appreciate them, so thank you, thank you to those that are leaving them.
10655000	10660000	That does it. Let's go around and get folks' final thought for the night. Loki!
10660000	10667000	My final thought is, sometimes the sound of goodbye is louder than any drum beat.
10667000	10671000	Okay, throwing it back, seventh style. I see you. I see you.
10671000	10677000	Then let's see, my final thought would be, um...
10679000	10687000	I guess then my final thought would be, die, Suke.
10687000	10691000	And until then, until next week, we'll see you in seven days, when once again we can...
10691000	10695000	Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.
