Digital Hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, QuakeCon winds down, but not without having unleashed information and a truly appetite wedding trailer for Doom Eternal.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
This is just one story and a week's worth of gaming news.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Stay tuned for this and so much more starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
Live tonight, episode number 741 for this, August the 12th of 2018.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
I am Rob Roberts or MrRobRoberts on Twitter and joining me is TechmasterLoki.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
How are you, Loki?

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm good. I'm full of breadsticks.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
And I heard you were mentioning before the show you actually got to play some games.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I did play games this week.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Good. We'll get into that in our gaming weeks in a little bit.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
And I mentioned to you off air, I went to the movies finally.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Because you know I never get out to the movies. Never ever.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
But I was finally able to go see Mamma Mia 2.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
And I had to drive all the way to San Jose to find somebody to see it with me.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
So there you go. I got to see Mamma Mia.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
And yes, Cher steals the entire movie.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
I know you were dying to know, Loki, but there it is.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
That's my review.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
So that's what's going on?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Yes. Yes.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Alright, anyway.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
You might notice at the beginning of the show I did not introduce Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Because she's been introduced enough times and we just said forget it.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Stop it.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
So here's what's up.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
She's actually going to be out of the show for a little while.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Everything is fine. Everything is totally fine.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
It's a work conflict, actually.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
So that part really sucks.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
But obviously we have to do what we have to do to pay the bills and to live our personal lives.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
So as you guys, I mean she's alluded to this a couple times on the show.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
She has some changes going on at work and she's kind of doing some new things.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Well they did a little schedule thing and she's going to have to work Sundays.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
So that sucks.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
And the part that really sucks is that as far as I know, we're stuck that way until February.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
So it's going to be a few months.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
It's going to be Halo Classic Game of the Week.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
You think? No. Here's the thing though.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Thanks to Radio Magic. We've been here before, believe it or not.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Even though people may be like, oh you know.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
And it does suck. I'm not going to belittle that point.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
But I have to move forward.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
The show must go on as they say.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
So you might remember this happened a couple years ago.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Something similar happened.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
And so we used Radio Magic to get her here every week to do the Classic Game of the Week.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
We'll do the same tonight and we'll continue to do that and continue to get her insight.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
And if you still want to email her questions and things like that, you can.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
Also, I'm told she is going to try to make it one show a month at the end of the month every month.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
Because this whole conflict is affecting her charity stuff she does with Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Which she's talked about on the show. She's very big on them.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
The problem is, they also meet on Sundays.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
So this whole thing with Sundays is a really bad personal thing for her.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
And again, you gotta do what you gotta do for work sometimes.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
So I think she said she's going to try to do one show a month where she can go do her meeting and then come here.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
So it's not like she's gone, gone, gone.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
But it is just going to be for a little while.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Loki and I holding down the fort in studio.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
Although I do hope to invite some of our familiar faces back.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
And some new ones too over the coming weeks.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Not that Dark Sakura's presence can possibly be filled.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
But we will do what we can to at least diversify the opinions here in studio.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Beyond just Loki and myself.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
One way of course that we always diversify the opinions every week is you guys in our chat room.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Where you guys join us live on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Again our chat at live.vognetwork.com.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
SSJ100Matt says, damn hope Jamie can phone in every once in a while.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Well certainly I will definitely take her calls as a priority.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
I think she's working during the show so she can't even listen sadly.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
But remember thanks to Radio Magic we can still have Jamie here for a little bit on the show every week.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
SSJ100Matt is also asking in chat. Kind of changing things a little bit here.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
San Jose is near MagWest was this weekend. Were you able to stop by Rob?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Sadly my answer is no.

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
And the double part about that that's kind of sad is because as I mentioned I was in San Jose yesterday.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
I went out there to visit my friends had a baby a couple months ago.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
And not to get too into personal details but the mom had some like medical issues after.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Everybody's fine everything's fine but she couldn't have visitors for a couple months.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
So I finally got to go out there to see the baby.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
And so I that was kind of the priority over and then we went to the movie together.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
That's who I would see the movie with and you know it was a little bit kind of time between us.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
And that was kind of the priority.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
I did consider going by MagWest after but the reality is it takes me two hours to drive to San Jose.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
So driven over that morning and then it was like I was already on my watch going it's gonna be nine o'clock before I get back.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
And that's assuming I don't go to MagWest at all.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
And I was getting text updates from friends that were there that were like oh they have keyboard mania.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
You know I haven't played one of those machines forever.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
But long story short I just didn't get over there due to personal stuff.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
And I kind of had a headache coming on towards the end of the day anyway.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
So I was just like you know what I need to just drive home and make sure I can feed Mr. Smoosh.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
Because Alan's been out all weekend actually Alan went camping this weekend.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
So yeah it's been like a crazy weekend all over the board.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
But sadly no I wasn't able to get to MagWest and that's now two years in a row.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
I'm hoping next year I'll have better luck.

05:45.000 --> 05:52.000
Hopefully well next year part of also why this happened when it did is that I actually probably could have done this trip sooner.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
But I had Clue and all those rehearsals that were taken like six weeks up to that.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
So I couldn't get out there like before now.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
So that also got in the way.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
So that probably I mean I say it got in the way but I love doing that show and that experience.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
But that will all not be a factor next year.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
So I'm really really hoping there'll be a third year.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Hopefully me not attending does not get the whole con cancelled.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I would love to go too.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
I'd love to go next year so that'll be good.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Yeah S.G.O. 100 Matt in chat says understood Rob you got to see the baby.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Yes I do. Yes I do.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
And it was it was totally worth it.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
Y.Y.R. in chat is asking about Jamie's absence here.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
Last time Jamie was out for an extended period she knew in advance was this kind of dropped on her.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Difficult for me to answer.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
I would have to defer to her.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
I think she knew there was a schedule change in the works.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
But she had a pretty good feeling she'd be able to get Sundays off.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
And I think the fact that she couldn't did kind of surprise her.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
That is my sort of perception based on what I've heard of what happened there.

06:55.000 --> 07:02.000
But I do know for what she does at her J job again I'm not going to get into all her business that's her stuff to explain.

07:02.000 --> 07:09.000
But for what she does her J job actually this change is a really good thing as to like what she's doing now.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
So it's just a bummer that the side effect is.

07:12.000 --> 07:19.000
But it's going to kind of put her back on the seniority so she's not or she's having to work Sundays which that part kind of sucks.

07:19.000 --> 07:27.000
So anyway S.S.J. 100 Matt talking about Magfest the main music and games festival back east.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Magfest is going to be a free for all mess again.

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
You know the jury's out on if I want to try for Magfest this year which sucks because I really need to kind of figure that out fast.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
Because I know the tickets in the hotels especially are going to be crazy pretty soon here.

07:39.000 --> 07:46.000
But jury's still out on the Magfest Prime just because between Dragon Con coming up in a few weeks.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
I can't believe Dragon Con is only like three weeks away.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
And then I'm doing Final Fantasy Fan Fest again.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I don't know if I have the time off available.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
Speaking of day jobs I don't know if I have the time off available to do Magfest.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
But if it all works out I would love to do it.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
That's for sure for sure.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Anyway let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
We're talking about a lot of personal stuff but let's get into some gaming discussion.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
So this is an interesting this isn't about this time like why why now.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
This is like a business element.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Yeah this is a weird timing thing.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
All right Logan just get into it.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
This whole thing is kind of weird.

08:21.000 --> 08:31.000
So there was a guy by the name of Ryan Hupp who was selling a copy of The Evil Within 2 on Amazon.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
Now it was a new copy because he hadn't unsealed it yet.

08:35.000 --> 08:48.000
Basically he had purchased a copy for the PlayStation 4 but ended up instead of using money to buy a PlayStation 4 he spent it on upgrading his PC so he didn't need a PlayStation 4 copy of the game.

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
So he went and sold it or trying to sell it on Amazon which people do.

08:54.000 --> 09:13.000
So Bethesda as a legal firm Boris had sent a letter to him threatening legal action for noncompliance basically saying that he is an unauthorized seller and it was unlawful for him to be selling that game.

09:13.000 --> 09:20.000
And you know to which you know of course there's the first sale doctrine which allows you to do that.

09:20.000 --> 09:34.000
This law firm apparently though is they like to take action against the first sale doctrine because they even have like a page on their site talking about how they get around that which it doesn't make any sense.

09:34.000 --> 09:47.000
Their reasoning for it was well it wasn't protected by the first sale doctrine because basically it wasn't in its original form which would include a warranty.

09:47.000 --> 09:58.000
Which my thought is where the fuck are these games coming with warranties from because I know if I purchase a game from GameStop or something like that that's sealed.

09:59.000 --> 10:06.000
How's that any different than purchase it from somebody else that's sealed. Where's my warranty difference. Is it that I can take it back to GameStop if it doesn't work.

10:06.000 --> 10:17.000
I mean I think so actually like I think it's all in fine print but I think like in the in the back of boxes or something it doesn't talk about like a manufacturer warranty sometimes I mean it's one of those things.

10:17.000 --> 10:29.000
Granted I hardly ever pay attention to question I don't know if they're necessarily going to question you know where you know you purchase it from maybe they would need a receipt or something like that to do the warranty on it.

10:29.000 --> 10:45.000
Okay I see it. Hold on. So I actually I just happen to have in studio a copy of Rise of the Tomb Raider on Xbox One. Don't ask it was here in studio and sure enough if you take the discount you read the back limited warranty for your copy of Xbox game software in the United States and Canada.

10:45.000 --> 10:53.000
So it says it's covered by this warranty within the 90 day period blah blah blah free of charge according to the process identified below.

10:53.000 --> 11:08.000
Warranty claims should be made to your retailer. Return the and I can't read it because the little disk nub is in the way but some I'm assuming is return the game to your retailer along with a copy of the original sales receipt and an explanation of the difficulty you're experiencing with the game.

11:08.000 --> 11:18.000
The retailer will either repair or replace the game. Any replacement game will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or 30 days from receipt whichever is longer blah blah blah blah blah.

11:18.000 --> 11:31.000
So so I mean to be fair yes when you buy a game there is a warranty you probably don't. It's such fine print it's sitting there behind the desk who's reading they're full of shit then if that's the case because there still is a warranty through Amazon.

11:32.000 --> 11:47.000
Because if you get a game that's effective and you file a claim through Amazon and you say hey this game is effective then the seller has to give you the money back or you have to ship it off to them or whatever the case may be so you do have coverage there.

11:48.000 --> 12:06.000
But it's whatever the case would be normally what it's supposed to be is that as long as it's not basically the limitations on it is that it's completely changed from its original form like you know because they sell.

12:06.000 --> 12:15.000
So so and Bobby says some comments here in our chat at live dog network dot com that I sort of he kind of simplifies it here he could sell it pre-owned since he owned it.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
Your receipt is your warranty but the first warranty was between the seller and the original retail retailer.

12:20.000 --> 12:29.000
So in other words even if it was sealed even if you never opened it this person that ends up buying it doesn't end up buying it as new because they would not be able to.

12:30.000 --> 12:38.000
I mean if the disc is defective or something like that they are up shit creek they can't use the original receipt because there is no receipt in this type of transaction.

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
Now I just want to state I don't necessarily agree with this whole thing I think that's why I kind of said this is whole right this is weird.

12:44.000 --> 12:55.000
And the reason why it's weird this is like a dude on eBay like what's what's the big fucking deal it's a dude on eBay like it does it does he sell five thousand of these games like to see how he's selling one.

12:55.000 --> 13:05.000
Yeah see that's that's the thing like why like is Bethesda going to patrol garage sales across America like here here's here's why I'm kind of going like.

13:05.000 --> 13:18.000
I used to sell sealed games all the fucking time because we would get like promotional copies which were just actual retail games and I would get like maybe three or four copies of a game.

13:18.000 --> 13:28.000
What am I going to do with that. I could give them the friends that I had sometimes but I'd sell them turn the profit. Why not. Right. And I didn't ever well email from.

13:28.000 --> 13:34.000
Well you know there is a why not is that because part of the terms of the promotion is that you're really not supposed to be able to.

13:34.000 --> 13:45.000
But that was a long no it was a long time ago. It was promotional as in it was it was people working for these companies that had they get free copies or extra copies and they're like here I don't want this crap.

13:45.000 --> 13:59.000
You take this. Yeah I'm sure if we wanted to dig into the legalese of it though we can find a problem with it. But I it was a long time ago doesn't matter. Here's the thing though. OK. Yeah I went to and I remember this is a while ago I went to the denials auction out in Roseville.

13:59.000 --> 14:13.000
You know the big flea market thing. And so this was when they used to have the place across the street also auction town or whatever it's called. This is a while ago but long story short there was a video game booth there that's always there in this video game booth had all these games.

14:13.000 --> 14:33.000
And one of the things they sold that they had for sale was a shrink wrapped copy of clue on the Super Nintendo. And I was like fuck yeah clue on the Super Nintendo like you know I which is ironic because I know I just talked about the movie not that long ago but I guess I've just always kind of liked clue in general and the whole you know fun murder mystery stuff.

14:33.000 --> 14:46.000
But I actually did kind of enjoy the Super Nintendo clue game which was also on the Genesis. Remember that needs to be a classic game of the week some week because it was it was very different from the board game. Anyway I wanted to get a copy of a clue on the Super Nintendo shrink wrap.

14:46.000 --> 14:58.000
I was like oh there was nothing that said it was new or anything like that. But I was like well that's kind of cool that it's still shrink wrapped. But I didn't think much of it. I was just like whatever you know in my mind I actually was kind of like new or not.

14:58.000 --> 15:11.000
Those Super Nintendo cartridges are fucking rocks. This game is still going to work right. So anyway I bought it brought it home opened it up. I ended up putting it in there and as I'm looking through the instruction manual the back of the manual already has stuff written in it.

15:11.000 --> 15:25.000
So my point is I bought a shrink wrap version of clue that was there to like be passed off as new and so forth. To be fair they didn't advertise this new. But it was you know it's certainly being re shrink wrapped made you think that or whatever.

15:25.000 --> 15:40.000
But it was a resealed used copy is what it was. Now in my opinion if Bethesda wants to pick a fight those types of you know retailers that are selling lots and lots of them should be where they're picking their file.

15:40.000 --> 15:53.000
They can't though because people there are people that you can't I don't even know how they're able to pick the fight like that because there's distributors I used to work for a distributor.

15:53.000 --> 16:12.000
We sell copies of games to other companies like a person that may work in you know have a shop in denial or whatever but they're brand new copies. So there is no like oh you have to sign a form to be a special reseller of this stuff.

16:13.000 --> 16:25.000
There was nothing like that. So all of this is horseshit from their lawyers. It's all horseshit. Good luck taking that to the court and actually arguing that first sale doctrine thing. See how that works out for you.

16:25.000 --> 16:34.000
Now granted they're going to strong arm somebody because it's one copy. He's like fuck it. I don't care. It's just one fucking copy of a game. You know fine. I won't sell it as brand new sealed.

16:35.000 --> 16:53.000
Does Bethesda has something to gain from this because this sure looks it. But this has got to be all their legal company. They're contracted organization like these legal things. And here's what Bethesda said about it too. They're like you know unless you remove all Bethesda products from your store for it or was this.

16:53.000 --> 17:05.000
No that wasn't. Oh here we go. But that does not and will not block the sale of pre-owned games. The issue in this case is that the seller offered a pre-owned game as new on the Amazon marketplace.

17:05.000 --> 17:17.000
We do not allow off non authorized resellers to represent what they sell is new because we can't verify that the game hasn't been opened and repackage. Oh wait it was an eBay it was Amazon.

17:17.000 --> 17:37.000
Yeah it was on Amazon. Oh I thought it was eBay this whole time. You can do the same thing though on eBay. I Amazon you can offer your items like you have. No I know I know the difference. I know there's the whole like there's plenty of shit on Amazon that instead of saying sold and shipped by Amazon dot com it says sold and shipped by you know Joe Schmo gaming company or something.

17:38.000 --> 17:52.000
But that is that does throw an interesting monkey wrench in the whole thing. It doesn't it doesn't any I said again here's the thing again I don't agree with going after one dude or whatever but Amazon is a store front.

17:52.000 --> 18:02.000
The guy is I'm sorry. How should I describe my game. You know I have a copy here. It's brand new in the box and it's still on it and never and sealed.

18:02.000 --> 18:14.000
But and I open now I'm the price bought and never opened. I just told you how to describe it by never open. It's fucking stupid. But why over we wouldn't have got sued if he called it bought never open.

18:15.000 --> 18:26.000
This is stupid. These. I mean why. Why are you wasting time. I don't disagree that it's stupid but at the same time like it's kind of like one of those like from a legal standpoint I get it.

18:26.000 --> 18:35.000
But is it worth it. No that is that is kind of like where my head's at right now. OK well let's just let him get away with it. Like they got away with charging for mods too. Let's never forget.

18:36.000 --> 18:45.000
Here's other fucking platform Loki. They're not getting away with it because we're not the only podcast sitting here this week. There's not the only gaming but I understand.

18:45.000 --> 18:55.000
Defending them and say well they were within the right. No fuck them. You know what. Fuck them. They're a big fucking company doesn't patch the fucking games. They can just they can fucking.

18:55.000 --> 19:06.000
What is OK. What is wrong. Loki was saying though legally I guess. Yeah maybe we should reevaluate that legal situation. Don't we do that a lot here.

19:06.000 --> 19:17.000
I know a lot in life in general. OK let's. Wow the laws are critically stupid. Here's hypothetically though let's let's just think about this. So say I am Joe Schmoe who owns a game shop.

19:17.000 --> 19:33.000
OK right. And I purchased my copy of the game from a distributor who was purchased it from Bethesda. Right. So technically I could be the first the game shop would be the first owner of it if I would say.

19:33.000 --> 19:43.000
So really the game shops give me the first owner and none of them are brand new. You're an authorized retailer. Am I because you know like because you went through an authorized distributor.

19:43.000 --> 19:54.000
So you're an authorized retailer. I just explained though that the thingy in the Tomb Raider thing I read did not say needs to go back to GameStop. It said authorized retailer. It doesn't matter.

19:54.000 --> 20:05.000
It doesn't matter though. There's no difference between that copy purchase at GameStop purchase from any other game store ever get into law directly. In fact if you ever get called for jury duty you should just say I.

20:06.000 --> 20:16.000
I'm going to yell and scream because law is stupid because I'm not law is stupid sometimes Loki. I'm not saying it don't ever get into law.

20:16.000 --> 20:27.000
I'm just going to tell you first sale doctor protects this kind of crap because and many have tried to get around the first sale doctrine and I'm sorry it's it's not gonna happen.

20:27.000 --> 20:35.000
Disney loves to try to fight this shit and telling you what you can and cannot do with copies that you've purchased you know through retail.

20:35.000 --> 20:42.000
So this is yet another company trying to do that. I'm sorry first sale dropped in first sale doctrine bitch. It's always going to fuck your shit up.

20:42.000 --> 20:51.000
So you just got to get over your shit and fucking just make better games or something if that's the problem. If we titled our show I would title this one first sale doctrine bitch.

20:51.000 --> 20:57.000
I mean like seriously it's stupid. It's absolutely stupid.

20:57.000 --> 21:07.000
S.S.G. 100 Matt in chat says over at live dot vog network dot com. I guess I kind of see it like buying selling a car. Someone can't just buy a car from a dealership drive down the street and sell it myself as new.

21:07.000 --> 21:14.000
No in fact once you drive a car they always say once you drive the car off the lot it's already lost like 10 percent of its value.

21:14.000 --> 21:24.000
Well I drove it on test drives. Technically that's off the lot. So you always want to fight it. Eric gave me that 10 percent discount.

21:24.000 --> 21:29.000
You always want to fight the man Loki.

21:29.000 --> 21:38.000
All right. Going to chat over at life not fog network dot com. Bobby agrees with me going through an authorized distributor you are an authorized retailer stores that you worked with Loki.

21:39.000 --> 21:51.000
They were authorized retailers. GameStop is not an authorized distributor. Why we are in chat says Are you sure you can't try to sell it as new. It doesn't mean someone is going to fall for it.

21:51.000 --> 22:01.000
But when the pink slips get exchanged while I are that's when your devious plan is going to go Ari because the person giving it to you on the pink slip is no longer going to be the retailer.

22:01.000 --> 22:10.000
That's that's why the DMV tracks all that stuff is who owned the car previously and all that stuff. So honestly just sell it again like on eBay or something. No one's going to pay attention.

22:10.000 --> 22:22.000
No there's no lawyers are going to fucking come after you for that shit. I did it all the fucking time. This all tie into why GameStop will not take your games back if they're sealed because I always thought that was more of an issue stolen game.

22:22.000 --> 22:30.000
Well yeah that's more of an issue with stolen games which that makes no fucking sense anyways because OK I'm taking the shrink wrap up. OK now I can take it back.

22:30.000 --> 22:43.000
Well technically you're going to hate me tonight. I don't care. Technically if the employee sees you do it the employee still has to say I'm sorry that came in here shrink wrapped. I can't take it because the employee saw you doing it.

22:44.000 --> 22:55.000
Now if you know that rule and you take the shrink wrap off as you're walking up to the store and throw it in nearby receptacle and the employee doesn't see you doing it then yeah you can sell it as back as pre-owned.

22:55.000 --> 23:06.000
And how dumb of a. Don't steal. Number one don't steal games. But number two I mean if you bought it if you really truly bought a game that you never fucking played and you've all done it.

23:06.000 --> 23:14.000
You've all you may not have done it with a physical game but open up this little application on your computer called steam. You've all fucking bought a game that you never played OK.

23:14.000 --> 23:21.000
So if you've ever done that a game a game at least one singular game. OK.

23:21.000 --> 23:29.000
I already know I'm not even going to turn around and look at the chat room because I know there's going to be somebody in there is going to be like well I load all of my games at least once.

23:29.000 --> 23:37.000
Anyway I'm just not even going to look fine. You're special. Have a cookie. But for the most part you're all out there. There's people that have bought games they've never fucking played.

23:37.000 --> 23:46.000
So if you've ever done it with a physical game and you try to go sell it back like you know you should be able to do that if you realized you made a mistake you have buyer's remorse.

23:46.000 --> 23:54.000
You should have the evil within two. I mean come on. We're not talking Skyrim. It's truly or even something that like people want again like no man's sky.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
Like it's not even a game where it's like suddenly you want this again. You know where it's it's riding a second wave.

23:59.000 --> 24:10.000
I'm just mad that someone doesn't want the evil within two and they're just like well it's dumb. It's dumb. It's stupid. They shouldn't get away with it.

24:10.000 --> 24:20.000
All right. Going to chat one more comment here. MXC in chat says I'm pretty sure a store near me sells stolen games or something. They sell the games as disc only.

24:20.000 --> 24:32.000
Yeah. Well I don't think that necessarily means it's stolen but that is strange. They could be weird flop things that like the manufacturing screwed up the box or something. I mean I don't know it's.

24:32.000 --> 24:40.000
Yeah they could be purchasing damaged stuff but yeah admittedly it's a stretch. But well remember when GameStop used to get so much shit because this wasn't that long ago.

24:40.000 --> 24:48.000
This is what like four or five years ago when the last copy of the game in the store was just the disc. They would be like this our last copy it's new.

24:48.000 --> 24:58.000
I'm going to put you may have noticed that your copy of Until Dawn Rush of Blood was not sealed because that was the last copy.

24:59.000 --> 25:12.000
They still do it. They still fucking do it. But they're an authorized reseller. What the fuck. What the fuck people. It's not sealed. How the fuck am I supposed to know that they're not an authorized reseller.

25:12.000 --> 25:29.000
Actually says that you fucking lied to me. Actually if they're still checking out game actually where the lawsuits for you know I'm going to I'm going to humor that argument because actually if they're still letting employees check out games and shit then Bethesda should be suing GameStop.

25:29.000 --> 25:40.000
They should be because you know why. Because they're just too fucking lazy to make up case art. And well they're saving on costs that way because they don't want to print their own cases.

25:40.000 --> 25:51.000
Anyway. All right. Let's move on. I don't know. I don't know if there's anything else we could say on this. All right. One more S.T. 100 Matt in chat says Loki would be the person to buy the car at the dealership.

25:51.000 --> 25:58.000
Put an ad on Craigslist for the new car that they have to meet you at that dealership. The car can't depreciate in value if it doesn't drive off the lot.

25:58.000 --> 26:10.000
Loki. I can see the meme right now and holding him. Oh the guy with the tap. Can't lose value if you don't drive it off the line. There you go. All right. Anyway let's move on.

26:10.000 --> 26:23.000
That's that's one of many news stories we get to cover tonight. No this is the problem with Jamie not being here is that there's no one to keep the peace. But at the same time what is Jamie ever been the one to keep the peace.

26:23.000 --> 26:34.000
I just feel like the balance is off. That's all. Loki and I are meant to fight for the next several months. All right. Anyway let's get into our gaming weeks. Let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

26:34.000 --> 26:48.000
Loki you've been playing some games. So I did play a couple of games. So I did actually get to play Horizon Zero Dawn finally. So that was pretty cool. And it looks gorgeous. And I played a few hours of that. I kind of dig it.

26:48.000 --> 27:05.000
I've already had the ending ruined for me sort of I kind of forgot a lot of that. So I'm just going to pretend that I don't know the twist but it is enjoyable. It's enjoyable game. I'm playing it on the easiest difficulty ever because I just don't want to give an effort to its story difficulty so you can focus on the story.

27:05.000 --> 27:29.000
It's still pretty difficult. So there's nothing wrong with playing a game on Ultra hard you know. And then Bobby Black Wolf flopped the game so you could have an easy mode. So use it. Exactly. All right. And then I loaded up the Java version of Minecraft because now having loaded on my son's laptop I realized that they have better controller support and stuff now.

27:30.000 --> 27:45.000
And it seems like it's a lot easier to do the mods and everything now. So I've been messing with that and I put the Pokemon mod on there and that's interesting walking around the game and having Pokemon everywhere that you can catch and stuff. Cute. It's neat.

27:46.000 --> 27:59.000
It'd be cool to do like a server like that. I don't know how to run that but it can be done. It's just can you run modded stuff with realms or not through realms realms is just through like the console.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
We said like months ago we were into a VOD.

28:03.000 --> 28:13.000
But like the console Minecraft is its own thing. So that's all the ones that are on everything. Not anymore. The piece is a PC connected to tablet connected to Nintendo. That's the Windows 10 version.

28:14.000 --> 28:22.000
OK. So the Windows 10 version is connected to all of those cross platform things. I'm talking about the Java version. Oh sorry.

28:22.000 --> 28:36.000
Old Minecraft. You're right. You're right. Yeah. So yeah. Old Minecraft. You can do all that fun stuff with Forge and everything. So I was trying that out. I couldn't get any of the shaders to run which is weird because I have like a GTX 1060 in there.

28:36.000 --> 28:46.000
So whatever happened to 4K graphics in Minecraft. They still have that E3 2017. They tease that. And I know y'all are laughing. Ha ha. Minecraft in 4K.

28:46.000 --> 28:57.000
But seriously check out the screenshots like it look gorgeous because sure it still has that old like you know retro look to it but like the water was really like the sunsets and the environment.

28:57.000 --> 29:05.000
Yeah. Look at like Sonic ether's unbelievable shaders or something like that. They can. It looks really nice and you can do like higher res textures and everything like that.

29:05.000 --> 29:18.000
Just yeah I wasn't able to get to work on my version of Minecraft I had. So I'm still trying to figure that out. But whatever. I mean it looks all right and runs good.

29:18.000 --> 29:33.000
And then I see what else they play. That's about it. I didn't really work a whole lot this week on on programming stuff. I mean I sort of did. I kind of was gathering information and everything.

29:33.000 --> 29:45.000
I'm trying to basically build what I had started building in unity for one of my game projects in unreal now. So I was kind of trying to see if there's better ways to do everything.

29:45.000 --> 29:57.000
So that's what I was doing this week. And then I picked up a surface pro 3. So I've been doing that. That's going to be exclusively for art work and stuff so I can actually draw my own artwork easily.

29:58.000 --> 30:14.000
So I'm looking forward to messing with that. All right. My gaming week pretty dull mostly because I was gone most of the weekend. So it's kind of a repetition of a lot of my old go tos Final Fantasy 14 was a big chunk of that because they got a minor update this week.

30:14.000 --> 30:24.000
But it added this new thing called Eureka pagos to it for those of you that play the game. So I've grinded enough of Eureka animals where I could go into the new one the pagos.

30:24.000 --> 30:37.000
So I was checking that out a little bit but it's because it is so new like there's a lot of stuff people are still trying to figure out with it. So it's probably going to take a couple weeks before people because you know there's crazies out there that will grind max level as fast as they can.

30:37.000 --> 30:49.000
And then you know kind of help people figure things out. So it's still in kind of a discovery mode. So I've been playing more of the first Eureka to still try to level up to the absolute cap that you can get to.

30:50.000 --> 30:58.000
Because it's interesting Eureka is like a separate leveling system than the rest of the game. But Eureka is also meant to be a little bit more of a throwback to Final Fantasy 11.

30:58.000 --> 31:07.000
Because like it's all about getting parties together to chain XP mobs and get XP that way. And if you die you level down just like in Final Fantasy 11.

31:07.000 --> 31:15.000
So unless you get resurrected which is actually a pretty easy thing to get. So but yeah if you if you're too lazy and you'll get resurrected you actually lose XP like you did in 11.

31:15.000 --> 31:24.000
But it doesn't affect the main game at all. It's all like a side thing that you do. That's where they put the new relics. So if you want to get your relic weapon it's all in there.

31:24.000 --> 31:33.000
So I've been playing a bit of that in Final Fantasy 14 and then continuing Heroes of the Storm. I've been playing two or three games of that like every day just to make sure I get my quest done.

31:33.000 --> 31:42.000
And you might be wondering like which character do I play? Which character do I like to play? I really kind of float around everybody because I'm always trying to finish my quests.

31:42.000 --> 31:54.000
But lately I've really taken a liking to Hanzo which is weird because I can't stand him in Overwatch. But like in Heroes of the Storm I really love some of the builds he can do because he's so good at what they call wave clear.

31:54.000 --> 32:03.000
So like you know how like in lane games there's like minions that will like you know crawl across the map. So like Hanzo has this thing where he can like insta kill minions if you build his thing a certain way.

32:03.000 --> 32:13.000
So it feels like really rewarding to kind of like if you're the only one on a lane which sometimes happens to like just insta kill all the minions and then it's really easy to kind of push the towers that way.

32:13.000 --> 32:23.000
So yeah I don't know like I really like playing Hanzo in that game. So yeah except he's so he's so weak. Like if somebody decides to target him they can shred him so fast.

32:23.000 --> 32:31.000
So that's the thing with Hanzo. But he can run over walls. That's the other thing. So like if you get in a bad situation you just run over walls and try to get out of it.

32:31.000 --> 32:39.000
So anyway. That's been pretty much my game a week otherwise. So no real announcements to tell you guys about.

32:39.000 --> 32:46.000
I already talked about Dragon Con stuff last week so I won't repeat myself except that we will not be here Labor Day weekend as I will be at Dragon Con in Atlanta.

32:46.000 --> 32:55.000
And if you're planning to be at Dragon Con I really do hope to see you there. I will have several panels where you can come say hello. I will publish a full schedule shortly.

32:55.000 --> 33:03.000
Actually it will be in the app which is expected to be updated around the 20th. So about 10 well actually yeah about 10 days for the Con 9 days for the Con.

33:03.000 --> 33:11.000
So the app will be fully updated and you can actually go and when you go into the guests attending professionals you can actually find Rob Roberts and you'll be able to see my whole schedule right there in the app.

33:12.000 --> 33:20.000
The funny thing is and I did this last year which was my first year as an attending professional because you make your own schedule in the app.

33:20.000 --> 33:30.000
So the first thing I'll do is I'll look up myself and favorite all my own stuff to make sure that my schedule is there first.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
And then the other stuff that I want to see I add to it because it will tell me if there's any conflicts.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
Like last year there was something I wanted to see and I couldn't go because I had a panel at the same time. It's like whoop conflict.

33:38.000 --> 33:45.000
That's the only bummer about Dragon Con. Too much going on that's sometimes scheduled at the same time.

33:45.000 --> 33:54.000
So anyway yes Bobby I will favorite yours next. The sad thing is Bobby there's and you already know this there's stuff that we have at the exact same time.

33:54.000 --> 34:02.000
In fact I believe the very first panel time slot Friday 10 a.m. well unless you count Thursdays because Thursday is the new Friday.

34:02.000 --> 34:10.000
But pretty much Friday the very first time slot in the morning like Bobby and I have a conflict. We are next door to each other.

34:10.000 --> 34:18.000
He's in like video games B and I'm in video games A. We have like panels and we are both moderating said panels.

34:18.000 --> 34:28.000
So literally competing against each other. But I have the Mass Effect actors. He has cell phone game development if I remember the timing right.

34:28.000 --> 34:37.000
I think we know who's going to win that. Well here's the thing. Maybe in popularity yes. However like yes I'm yes I will win that contest in popularity.

34:37.000 --> 34:44.000
But that's not really about that because if I'm a developer sometimes it's not about like that it's about what are you going to get out of a panel.

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
If I'm a developer you're going to get more out of Bobby's panel than you will out of mine with the Mass Effect.

34:48.000 --> 34:54.000
But if you're a fanboy you're going to get more out of mine. Well I would go to Bobby's panel anyways because I don't really care for Mass Effect.

34:54.000 --> 35:04.000
See there you go. And that's totally fine. Both panels will be great. All right. Anyway. All right.

35:04.000 --> 35:13.000
SSG100 Matt in chat says one of you should pull a Carson and storm the others panel. You know it is what is interesting is it is the first year that Bobby and I are kind of do it.

35:13.000 --> 35:23.000
So honestly I could go over there and say I'm Bobby Black Wolf and he could go over there and say he's Rob Roberts. I don't think anyone would ever know.

35:23.000 --> 35:32.000
They would when they start asking development questions and I just feel that's a good question. What do you think. I wish I knew that.

35:32.000 --> 35:38.000
Well just have you tried turning up the graphics on level three.

35:38.000 --> 35:44.000
Every time your development on and then back or off. Have you tried turning it off and then on again.

35:45.000 --> 35:56.000
No I'm not. I'm not going to do that to the poor developers out there that really want to learn something from the talented people behind Simpsons tapped out that cell phone game is is nuts.

35:56.000 --> 36:04.000
There's I know people that play that game that would even consider themselves gamers but it's like dude you're obsessed with Simpsons tapped out like you're a gamer.

36:04.000 --> 36:12.000
So anyway moving on let's get into some news stories and stop talking about dueling panels Loki once you start us off with some news tonight.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
OK so there's lots of different Diablo games in the works.

36:16.000 --> 36:32.000
This is Blizzard. Apparently they put out a short video with the community manager Brandy Kamel and promised that there is going to be that they're not ignoring the Diablo fans that they have multiple projects in the works.

36:32.000 --> 36:37.000
Some of them are going to take longer than others but we may have some things to show you later this year.

36:38.000 --> 36:49.000
Yeah hit hit Blizzcon later this year get those pre-orders or do they sell tickets for that or there is I think a third wave coming a surprise third wave of tickets coming up shortly.

36:49.000 --> 37:01.000
But the main waves have all sold out and I would imagine this third wave is probably like rejected cards and possible spam bought things that have been caught for the first two waves being real.

37:01.000 --> 37:07.000
So I would imagine this third wave is going to be very small. So well pre-order that pay-per-view.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
Yeah right. Yeah they have the good old pay-per-view I guess so.

37:10.000 --> 37:18.000
Yeah man I do wish I was going to Diablo this year or Blizzcon this year because Diablo is my favorite of all the franchises that Blizzard does.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Apparently you're a gamer was saying that.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Have you heard some of the rumors.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
Yeah they reported that Diablo 3 is coming to the switch.

37:25.000 --> 37:34.000
And that one's been out there for a while. I think that would be a good thing to drop at Blizzcon for the holidays is that Diablo 3 is coming out on switch.

37:34.000 --> 37:46.000
I mean but there's also that part of me that's like okay but like I've I've literally played through Diablo 3 like hundreds of times like there's there's only so much more I can give to that game.

37:46.000 --> 37:56.000
If they're going to sweeten the pot by putting some new stuff in Diablo 3 like a proper expansion but I'm not going to hold my breath because I kind of think they're working on Diablo 4.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
I think we're far enough out now where we can start saying the number 4.

37:59.000 --> 38:08.000
But the other rumor that's out there is that they are going to remaster Diablo 2 just like they did with Starcraft not that long ago.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Maybe.

38:09.000 --> 38:23.000
Because you know people still love Starcraft and there's still people that swear by Diablo 2 as the Diablo which I totally get because there was a lot that changed between Diablo 2 and 3 especially when it comes to like classes and just the way the game played.

38:23.000 --> 38:32.000
So there's people that are still loyal to Diablo 2 so to remake Diablo 2 with just HD graphics I think there'd be a huge interest for that.

38:32.000 --> 38:36.000
So I wouldn't be surprised at all for that to be a big reveal as well.

38:36.000 --> 38:42.000
So those might be like they're sooner than others they're going to announce you know Diablo 3 on Switch and Diablo 2 remaster.

38:42.000 --> 38:48.000
And maybe you know again I'm fan wanking get the tarp because I'm fan wanking.

38:48.000 --> 38:57.000
Maybe the way they're going to sweeten the pot with Diablo 3 on the Switch is to include the Diablo 2 remaster on the Switch with it. Wouldn't that be something?

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
I don't know if that...

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
I warned you it was fan wank.

39:01.000 --> 39:08.000
Alright so anyway but those would probably be the sooner things than like Diablo 4 would be the way out thing.

39:08.000 --> 39:20.000
But I'm expecting it to be a very Diablo year at Blizzcon because I mean Overwatch like they might unveil a new character but like Overwatch I don't see them suddenly going we're going to make Overwatch 2.

39:20.000 --> 39:30.000
Like Overwatch League is still kind of like you know Overwatch League we know is going to grow next year and you know I feel like it's still kind of like they don't need to do a lot of it.

39:30.000 --> 39:39.000
I would still love for them to announce we're making like some PvE dedicated stuff that's not part of an event that like there's going to be some year round PvE in the game.

39:39.000 --> 39:49.000
I still would love to see that but I'm not holding my breath on that. I feel like Overwatch is still enough of an attraction that people want to check it out.

39:49.000 --> 39:54.000
World of Warcraft they've got an expansion coming out next week believe it or not.

39:54.000 --> 40:00.000
So they're not exactly going to announce a new expansion at Blizzcon.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
Starcraft?

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
They may announce a new patch.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
So yeah that leaves Starcraft and Heroes of the Storm.

40:06.000 --> 40:11.000
Well Heroes of the Storm like Overwatch you're not going to they're just going to keep adding to it.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
So they're going to be like we have a new battleground some new heroes that's what they'll do with Heroes of the Storm.

40:14.000 --> 40:23.000
So yeah either they're going to unveil something their big unveil has got to be either Starcraft which would mean like a Starcraft 3 or another Starcraft 2 expansion.

40:23.000 --> 40:28.000
I just I just don't think now's the time for Starcraft I think now's the time for Diablo I really do.

40:28.000 --> 40:36.000
Because Starcraft just got that remaster last year that was kind of the big thing so I just it's Diablo's time to shine.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
You'll really do a new game?

40:39.000 --> 40:49.000
They could Blizzard could have I mean and then of course I'm neglecting Hearthstone but again Hearthstone is also just an evergreen type of game where they'll say oh we've got another card expansion coming.

40:49.000 --> 40:59.000
Sure Blizzard could always announce a new game why not the last the only time I went to Blizzcon was the year they announced Overwatch and it was a big fucking deal like Overwatch was a very new type of thing for Blizzard.

40:59.000 --> 41:05.000
So I'm sure Blizzard's working on a whole new idea out there somewhere but you know we'll see.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
I don't know if this is the year for that either.

41:09.000 --> 41:17.000
Over in chat at live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwool says it's rock and roll racing's time to shine bring back rock and roll racing.

41:17.000 --> 41:23.000
You know what rock and roll racing would actually make an amazing map in Heroes of the Storm.

41:23.000 --> 41:37.000
So I'm kind of surprised that that isn't something that they're trying to trying to do is like a racing map or like as part of the like the lanes or tracks and then like you could like unveil like as part of like the the mini objectives like cars that would like drive over your enemies and stuff and knock them back.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
That would be really funny but anyway who knows.

41:40.000 --> 41:44.000
ActDeft in chat says I still want Overwatch on Switch.

41:44.000 --> 41:49.000
Never say never I mean that could be could be a thing could happen.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
Alright.

41:50.000 --> 41:56.000
Kaijuto in chat says in the era of microtransaction I'm not happy about a Diablo 2 remake.

41:56.000 --> 42:11.000
Well for what it's worth Kaijuto when they did the Starcraft remake it was just like they didn't inject DLC into it and they didn't inject like other stuff it was like pay $19.99 and get original Starcraft just as it was but with HD graphics.

42:11.000 --> 42:25.000
So I have a feeling if they do a Diablo 2 remaster it's not going to be like it's going to be like if you want to play Diablo 2 with pretty graphics or whatever it's 20 bucks or 30 bucks whatever they end up charging for I don't think they'll suddenly be like and we're putting treasure boxes in it.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
I don't think they'll do that.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
No.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
I don't think they will.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
Alright.

42:29.000 --> 42:34.000
Anyhow let's talk about the Smash Brothers Direct that happened this week.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
Did you watch the Smash Brothers Direct?

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
I did.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
I didn't.

42:37.000 --> 42:50.000
I have to admit I'm only mentioning this based on what I've read around the internet and I did I did watch one reveal trailer because I am very excited about Simon Belmont coming to Super Smash Ultimate.

42:50.000 --> 43:04.000
And I realize he's been rumored for a long time but it was it still was something to see that whole unveil trailer with not just death killing Luigi but like all of the all of the bosses were in that little reveal trailer that was pretty badass.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
Yeah that's all part of that one level too.

43:05.000 --> 43:17.000
I'm like I never realized I want Nintendo to make a new Castlevania game or I guess maybe if they're having Nanko Bandai's help or whatever but like I'm like damn like they they make Castlevania look real good.

43:18.000 --> 43:25.000
So yes Simon Belmont is coming to Super Smash Ultimate and since they're doing this whole shadow characters is that what they're called shadow characters?

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
Echo Fighters.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
Echo Fighters.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
Excuse me.

43:28.000 --> 43:32.000
Um padding roster is what they roster padding.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
They're fucking allowed Loki.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
They're fucking allowed.

43:34.000 --> 43:40.000
Honestly after some of the stuff that Sakurai has delivered with this they're fucking allowed to do like elaborate pallet swaps that they want.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
I'm totally okay with it.

43:41.000 --> 43:49.000
So yes they're doing Echo Fighter for Richter Belmont in addition to Simon Belmont which I think is badass.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
I think I kind of like Richter.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
No Alucard.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
I mean I just careful what you wish for.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
You never know.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
So you don't know what's there.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
That was not the only character they unveiled.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
They also unveiled King K. Rool.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
King K. Rool if you if you will.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
The antagonist in the Donkey Kong series.

44:04.000 --> 44:10.000
Well the modern Donkey Kong series not the old ones obviously because the antagonist in the old Donkey Kong game was Mario.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
Ha ha.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
Plot twist.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
But anyway King K. Rool.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
I think.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
And more fucking Fire Emblem characters.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
Hooray.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Which are also Echo Fighters right?

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
Yeah.

44:20.000 --> 44:26.000
King K. Rool is honestly I'm not that excited about that unveil.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
Like send your hate mail right on in.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
I don't care.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
All the dudes from Contra.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Contra dudes.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
But I'm not that excited.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
I mean here's the thing though.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
I'm not shitting on Smash Brothers Ultimate by any means.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
This game is going to be fucking fantastic.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
And with the roster as big as it is.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Echo Fighters or not.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
They're allowed to have one or two characters that I'm going to go.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
You know what?

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
I'm just not going to play that character.

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
I can't wait for the very last director they're going to have at Smash when they announce Waluigi.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Because they're going to save that.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
For the end.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
Y'all need to let it go.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Waluigi is not going to be in the fucking game.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
And you need to just.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Well he's going to be an assist and that's it.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
And y'all need to let Sakurai get his fucking sleep.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
And never ask him for anything ever again.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
It's coming.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
It'll be the last one.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
The very last one.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
No.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
No.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
Because this is the thing.

45:14.000 --> 45:19.000
Waluigi does not need his redemption as much as.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
Wart.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
The antagonist in Mario Brothers 2.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
I agree.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
He's disappeared ever since.

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
Or half of the other Mario Brothers 2 characters.

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
Honestly, Wart would make me so fucking happy.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
I would cry.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
What about Birdo?

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
I'll take it.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
I'll take Birdo.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
But Wart is really like.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Wart is my like A tier wish list.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Birdo's like B tier.

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
Birdo could be like an echo fighter for like Yoshi or something.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
Going to chat.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
Bobby Blackwolf said.

45:48.000 --> 45:53.000
Luigi died and will be replaced by Waluigi.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Well technically Mario died too.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
So there's a lot of death in there.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
Let's see.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
SHO 100 Matt points out.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Wart and Mouser were a dream.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
You know what?

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Some dreams are real.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
Dreams are a reflection of reality.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
Are they not?

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
Anyway.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
I just think they need to go obscure.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Captain Rainbow.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Let's put Tingle in there.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
Fuck yeah.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
Let's put Tingle.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
He has an actual fighter.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
Fuck this assist shit.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
Do you know what's funny though?

46:22.000 --> 46:26.000
Since I talk about like people need to fucking leave Sakurai alone and all this stuff.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Did you know he actually went to Twitter this week?

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
And a translated version of the tweet reads like this.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
Again, I'll do my best for the presentation tomorrow.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
It'll start at a relatively convenient time in Japan.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
So please watch it.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
My eyes might be a little red.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
That's because they're a little tired.

46:42.000 --> 46:47.000
Because people are kind of noticing that Sakurai looks like he's fucking been through it.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
Like he looks like he has been through it.

46:50.000 --> 46:55.000
So that's why I'm saying you Waluigi fucks need to leave him alone.

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
Leave Sakurai alone!

46:59.000 --> 47:04.000
He's created the greatest, one of the greatest video games of all time.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Leave him alone!

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
That was my attempt to mimic leave Britney alone to make success.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Anyway.

47:15.000 --> 47:21.000
And you know, keep in mind during all of this, like this game is in crunch time right now.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
So this is like, and this game is already announced.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Like it is happening for the holidays.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
It is not getting pushed back.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
So you know what, Sakurai is probably having a rough life right now.

47:30.000 --> 47:37.000
I just hope, you know what, when he has finished the game and he's released it and it sold 11 billion copies,

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
I hope he gets a fucking vacation.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
You know what, he can do what Barack Obama's done.

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
He can fucking take a vacation and not look back on this shithole of a country.

47:46.000 --> 47:52.000
That's what he can do when he's earned his due.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
He can just take a vacation and never come back.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
He's earned it.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
I'm not saying he should never develop again.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
No, I love him and he should.

48:01.000 --> 48:07.000
But if he wants to take a nice long vacation for like two years, he is allowed.

48:07.000 --> 48:15.000
SSG100Matt says he wanted a vacation after Smash 4, but Nintendo wouldn't let him.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.000
Well that's why I'm saying Nintendo, give the man a fucking break.

48:19.000 --> 48:23.000
Anyway, let's move on. More news, Loki.

48:24.000 --> 48:29.000
So Nintendo, speaking of, well, I don't know if they're not necessarily giving people a break,

48:29.000 --> 48:35.000
but they have that whole lawsuit against Love Roms for of course storing ROMs of their games on there

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
and they've taken them to court for that.

48:38.000 --> 48:45.000
So kind of spooked by that, MU Paradise is actually announcing that they have,

48:45.000 --> 48:49.000
based on the recent legal action of other ROM sites,

48:49.000 --> 48:56.000
they'll be changing and ceasing to offer ROM versions of Nintendo's and other companies' older games.

48:56.000 --> 49:01.000
It's not worth it for us to risk potentially disastrous consequences.

49:01.000 --> 49:07.000
I cannot in good conscience risk the future of our team members who have contributed to the site throughout the years.

49:07.000 --> 49:14.000
We run MU Paradise for the love of retro games and for you to be able to revisit those good times.

49:14.000 --> 49:20.000
Unfortunately, it's not possible right now to do so in a way that makes everyone happy and keeps us out of trouble.

49:22.000 --> 49:28.000
So they've decided to make a new start. We will continue to be passionate retro gamers

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
and we'll continue doing cool stuff around retro games.

49:31.000 --> 49:37.000
But you won't be able to get your games from here for now.

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
Where we go with this is up to you.

49:41.000 --> 49:47.000
Well, what can you say? I mean, the games will be elsewhere. They will always be elsewhere.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
This is the internet. One site goes down, another one goes up.

49:50.000 --> 49:56.000
So I think as far as the website MU Paradise is concerned, now it's kind of a test of the community over there.

49:56.000 --> 50:02.000
Without the ROMs, are they still going to have the community to keep that site?

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
They're never going to stop ROMs from being on the internet. They're everywhere.

50:06.000 --> 50:11.000
All it's going to do if they really start hammering down on these ROM sites is just going to push it more underground.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
You know, we were talking a little bit about this at the end of Bobby's show this week.

50:14.000 --> 50:23.000
I don't want to repeat myself too much, but as much as I respect Nintendo's right to protect these games that they made in the 80s.

50:23.000 --> 50:29.000
You know what? You can't pirate Disney movies that were made in the 60s and the 50s as much as you want to.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
You can't just pirate and copy those movies.

50:31.000 --> 50:36.000
So if Nintendo wants to enforce the trademark on their games, they have that right whether you like it or not.

50:36.000 --> 50:45.000
But I also think you don't want to take ROMs away completely because there is a lot that can be learned about game development from them.

50:45.000 --> 50:50.000
There's a lot that can be unveiled about games that never existed in the first place.

50:50.000 --> 50:54.000
And what we've learned from the failures of that.

50:54.000 --> 51:02.000
And there are some developers that have made arcade games that were emulated in MAME.

51:02.000 --> 51:10.000
And the guys that made the original arcade games released their source public domain to be like,

51:10.000 --> 51:16.000
Sure, emulate all you want. Learn from what we developed. Learn how we made the games. Use this to learn.

51:16.000 --> 51:21.000
So I think I would never want to see emulation go away completely.

51:21.000 --> 51:28.000
Absolutely not because I think there's so much to learn from those that are fine with their stuff being released to the public.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Once again though, I don't even know.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
Robbie Roto or whatever that game is that was released not that long ago.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Well, it was probably like five years ago at this point.

51:35.000 --> 51:40.000
I understand that they would have to enforce their copyrights or they lose it.

51:40.000 --> 51:46.000
But at the same time, I don't think that pirating ROMs is necessarily...

51:46.000 --> 51:53.000
Well, first off, I mean, like if you own copies of the games and you're just getting a ROM dump of it,

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
I don't see the problem there in the first place.

51:55.000 --> 52:00.000
And second off, is it really affecting the sales of these things?

52:00.000 --> 52:05.000
I've downloaded full ROM sets of the NES library and Super NES library like dozens of times.

52:05.000 --> 52:10.000
I still bought those ROMs. Like I bought them originally when they were out in the NES.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
I bought them on the Super NES. I bought them on the Wii.

52:13.000 --> 52:18.000
I bought them on the 3DS when I had it. I bought them on the Wii U.

52:18.000 --> 52:24.000
I bought the Super NES Classic, so it's not affecting my purchasing of their stuff.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Believe it or not, I'm like right with you there.

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
Of course I've downloaded a shit ton of ROMs in my day,

52:29.000 --> 52:38.000
but I still support way more than I'd like to admit of the Virtual Console stuff that Nintendo and likewise put out.

52:38.000 --> 52:45.000
Even like the Sega Genesis collection. How many times have I bought the Sega Genesis collection on different systems?

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
Like PC, Playstation 3, Playstation 4? Like a lot, okay?

52:48.000 --> 52:54.000
And I'm even still eyeing like, do I want one of those Sega Genesis plastic consoles that they sell at Target?

52:54.000 --> 53:04.000
Same thing with Atari Flashback. You can fit the entire Atari library on an old floppy disk.

53:04.000 --> 53:12.000
Like those games are itty bitty. That's part of what's so fucking impressive about how so many of them were programmed is that those games are so small in the data.

53:12.000 --> 53:16.000
But anyway, like, you know, the entire Atari 2600 library is not that big.

53:16.000 --> 53:22.000
I'm still sitting here going, I kind of want to get an Atari Flashback 8 with all the Activision games on it.

53:22.000 --> 53:27.000
Like just because they're that good. And I buy the Atari stuff like, you know, anyway.

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
So I just don't understand like, what is, I mean I get that they're-

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
Emulation is emulation. It's emulating the real thing. It's not the real thing.

53:33.000 --> 53:37.000
They weren't coming after these companies like, I mean this stuff has been out there forever.

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
So I don't understand like, why now they decided to like, come after these companies.

53:41.000 --> 53:52.000
I mean, my thought is just that like, do you really want to turn people like, against like, not necessarily turning against them because of-

53:52.000 --> 53:57.000
But like, when it starts with these emulation sites and then eventually it's going to move to,

53:57.000 --> 54:03.000
Oh hey, these are the guys that are actually, you know, getting the archives of the stuff for historical preservation.

54:03.000 --> 54:08.000
And now you're going to come after them. Because it's once, it's going to just eventually lead up to that.

54:08.000 --> 54:15.000
I hope not. I mean, you know, honestly, I realize that those words aren't going to hold a lot of weight.

54:15.000 --> 54:21.000
But I just, I really hope not. Especially, you know, with some of the great things a lot of video game preservationists are trying to do.

54:21.000 --> 54:30.000
You know, I would really hope Nintendo would respect that like, what those guys are doing is not about trying to just like, distribute a shit ton of ROMs.

54:30.000 --> 54:35.000
And, you know, and whatever, and derail Virtual Console or whatever Nintendo wants to invent in their mind.

54:35.000 --> 54:40.000
But there are people that really do want to preserve video game history as an art form.

54:40.000 --> 54:48.000
As, you know, there is a film, what is it, the Film Preservation Society or whatever, maybe one of you guys in chat knows the exact name of this.

54:48.000 --> 54:54.000
They select like 20 or 25 films a year to be preserved like forever type of thing.

54:54.000 --> 55:01.000
Or the way that books get preserved in a library and in like, you know, a national library and so forth.

55:01.000 --> 55:09.000
Like, you know, video games are an art form that deserve to have some preservation efforts taken around them because discs rot.

55:09.000 --> 55:17.000
Servers go down and they go away forever. But there ought to be a way that, you know, the future can play these games too.

55:17.000 --> 55:23.000
Just like, you know, it's funny, Melody and I were talking the other day about, you know, some of the stuff we were, I was, because I was joking.

55:23.000 --> 55:30.000
Because when the baby was trying to grab my finger, I started to get an Xbox controller and I was like, here, you should start learning on this.

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
And Melody says, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we're going to make her play 8-bit games first.

55:34.000 --> 55:39.000
Then she's going to play 16-bit and we're going to, and I've heard a lot of new parents say this type of thing.

55:39.000 --> 55:43.000
Like, we're going to work them through the generations just like we did it.

55:43.000 --> 55:50.000
But it's like, whoa, what if, what if the 8-bit games, the 16-bit games aren't there to do that with?

55:50.000 --> 55:55.000
I mean, sure, Super Mario Brothers will probably always be released on every Nintendo system ever.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
But what about the Guardian Legend?

55:58.000 --> 56:06.000
I consider the Guardian Legend to be an 8-bit classic that I fucking grew up on that, like, makes me part of, like, the gamer fan that I am today.

56:06.000 --> 56:13.000
That game has never been available on Virtual Console, any type of legal collection.

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
If it were not for emulation, I couldn't play the Guardian Legend.

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
You couldn't play the Guardian Legend to see what is it that Rob loves so much about this fucking game.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
I bought you a copy of the Guardian Legend.

56:23.000 --> 56:28.000
Yeah, I actually have the Guardian Legend, like, three different times on cartridge, but I'm okay with that.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
I am totally okay with that. You know what I mean?

56:30.000 --> 56:39.000
It's like, you know, if I don't have a working Nintendo and a cartridge like that, there is no other legal way for me to play it.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
And I don't want that game to go away.

56:41.000 --> 56:51.000
And there's going to be some games that just fall in this weird fucking tricky legal void because one company swallowed another company, swallowed another company, where if it wasn't for emulation, it wouldn't be able to do this.

56:52.000 --> 56:57.000
So, anyway, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

56:57.000 --> 57:02.000
SSJ100Matt says, Sounds like this baby is going to be a future OLR co-host in 18 years.

57:02.000 --> 57:07.000
Well, you know, that's the plan, is to hand it off to Josh and Julian in the future.

57:07.000 --> 57:13.000
And then possibly other new kids as well.

57:13.000 --> 57:17.000
That way it will always keep the crown of longest running gaming podcasts.

57:17.000 --> 57:25.000
How have you done a gaming podcast for 100 years? Well, it all started many years ago.

57:25.000 --> 57:31.000
Anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about some changes with Twitch.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Let's talk about newer things, very new things.

57:33.000 --> 57:37.000
Another way we kind of preserve games through video and broadcasting.

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
So, Twitch is going to be making some big changes.

57:40.000 --> 57:44.000
When I saw the headline, I actually got the email about this, as did many of you Twitch users.

57:44.000 --> 57:49.000
And when I first saw that the email said, we're getting rid of communities, I was a little bit sad.

57:49.000 --> 57:57.000
Because I actually really like the communities for discoverability, especially being part of the LGBT family on Twitch.

57:57.000 --> 58:05.000
I am always using LGBT to find, you know, other streamers on Twitch that are in that family as well.

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
So, when I first read this, I was like, this is really sad.

58:08.000 --> 58:12.000
But I also realized that most of the communities, I'm using my quoting fingers.

58:12.000 --> 58:15.000
Most of the communities on Twitch are named after games.

58:15.000 --> 58:25.000
And it's like, you shouldn't need a community for Super Smash Brothers because you put that you're streaming Super Smash Brothers and people will find it.

58:25.000 --> 58:28.000
You don't need communities based on games, you know what I mean?

58:28.000 --> 58:33.000
So, I guess to some extent Twitch has kind of realized that this is going on too.

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
So, they're changing it.

58:34.000 --> 58:40.000
And I must admit, once I read fully the changes, I'm okay with it.

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
In fact, actually, I do think it's going to be for the better in the long run.

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
So, here's the deal, they're going to have a new tagging system.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
So, you'll be able to tag your streams.

58:50.000 --> 58:55.000
And they, LGBT specifically, they actually called out in the email specifically the LGBT streamers.

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
And they mentioned that that will be a tag.

58:58.000 --> 59:05.000
But they're also going to do tags for like, first time playthrough, game development, speed runs, you know, all these like different types of things.

59:05.000 --> 59:12.000
And I did appreciate that Twitch was very open to be like, here is a spreadsheet of all of the tags we're going to be introducing.

59:12.000 --> 59:16.000
And if you don't think we have something captured here, like let us know, reply to this email.

59:16.000 --> 59:20.000
I don't know if this only went to affiliates maybe, but I feel like everybody probably got it.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Maybe it was just an affiliate thing.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Hopefully it wasn't under NDA.

59:24.000 --> 59:32.000
But anyway, I mean, honestly, you know, I think it's great what Twitch is doing to try to proactively get out there and listen to the feedback from the community.

59:32.000 --> 59:36.000
There's also going to be more categories that are going to be added to Twitch as well.

59:36.000 --> 59:42.000
Things that are going to help make things more specific than just IRL and creative.

59:42.000 --> 01:00:01.000
So, they're going to break these down into art, hobbies and crafts, food and drink, music and performing arts, beauty and body art, science and technology, just chatting, traveling outdoors, sports and fitness, tabletop RPGs, special events, talk shows and podcasts, and ASMR.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Which, you know, for those of you that like to have your gaming streams like this, and now I'm going to slowly click the buttons as I play the game.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Have you ever tried to get into that? Alan loves that ASMR.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I watched one. It was, I think it was a parody, but it was still ASMR. It was like ASMR bank robbery.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:42.000
If that's what you're into, look, Alan like loves that stuff. And I tease him. I'm only teasing because I love and like, honestly, like, I my like nothing for me for ASMR. Nothing is ever going to beat the pickle lady.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:52.000
There's that there's that lady on YouTube. I don't know her name. Maybe somebody who knows it. She's infamous. And she's sitting there and she's got like she shoves this gigantic ass fucking pickle in her mouth and she's just about to choose down.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:05.000
And it's just like all this noise. And I'm like, damn, that's impressive. But I guess some people like just like really sensitive to that type of noise, like it's very relaxing.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Just like how some people could like, well, I'm sure there's a lot of people that want to sleep with a white noise machine. Whereas I can't stand those things. But for some people, it really helps them.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:26.000
So, hmm. Anyway, looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, SSJ100Matt says, sounds like NPR just needs some smooth jazz in the back.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Let's see. Tigerclaw says, I sleep with a white noise machine, a fan.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Raginator says, just watch. The tagging will get abused in ways the Twitch isn't foreseeing. And eventually they'll say, yeah, we didn't see this going to shit in a dumpster fire.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Well, Raginator, for what it's worth, you're not going to be able to invent your own tags. You do have to use the tags that are there.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:52.000
And especially with so many affiliates and partners and things, you don't want to get kicked out of those programs by doing something stupid with the tagging program.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:59.000
So, I mean, obviously it's not going to be perfect 100% with the time. There's always going to be some trolls. But I think for the most part, it should be OK.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:14.000
So, anyway. Anyway, Kaijuto in chat says, Twitch blows with these tags. I'd be curious, a more elaborated version of that comment. Like, what do you not like about that? I'd be curious.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Because I'm open to it. I realize that communities probably aren't working quite as they were intended. I like them, but it also really annoys me that the Xbox version of Twitch,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:35.000
and I realize Microsoft's got the whole Mixer thing going on, so maybe Twitch isn't as, you know, wanting to get updated on Xbox. But it really annoys me that the community search isn't on the Xbox version of Twitch.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:50.000
And I don't even think it works on the, even the new PlayStation one. I don't think has it. I could be wrong. But I'm kind of annoyed that, so I hope if they do bring the tagging, that they will update the viewer on all these different, you know, systems they have them on to support the tags as well.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000
That would be, that would be wonderful. Alright, a few more stories before we get to the classic game of the week. Loki?

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Alright, so this is something that's been going on this week. There was this review by a now former IGN editor by the name of Felipe Musen, and he was fired because apparently it was thought that he plagiarized his review from a YouTube channel.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:32.000
So he had a, there was a YouTuber by the name of Boomstick Gaming that did a review for Dead Cells, and it came out several days earlier.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:46.000
And then he released his review on IGN, and then of course Boomstick Gaming kind of noticed that, and they put out a video comparing the two saying, hey, he plagiarized my review.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:04:02.000
And so then IGN reviewed it, and they took down the review and basically fired him because they thought I guess as well that he did, you know, I guess enough of the review was taken from the other one.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Then on top of that though, so after that whole drama happens, there's other articles coming out, people start looking at his other reviews, and apparently his FIFA 18 review is also very similar to, the FIFA 18 Switch review is very similar to what was on Nintendo Life.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:29.000
And also apparently he had done this maybe with even some other reviews for other games.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:40.000
But he had come out on his YouTube channel and basically said, you know, the bottom line is that what happened with Dead Cells reviews was not at all intentional.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:53.000
So with all that said, I just want to apologize to everybody at IGN for the undeserved criticisms and doubts that many may have sparked in their credibility as a respected source for games media.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Basically saying, you know, yeah, it was just a coincidence that I happened to use a similar phrasing to these other channels and stuff, but it's just a little too close to what it was.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:17.000
So he sort of admitted that there's a problem and then said, but it wasn't a problem. I really feel like there's a complete contradiction even within this YouTube thing.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:33.000
And then apparently there's also a third review that he had done as well, and Gadget had posted a review of Metroid Samus Returns last September, and then about five days later he posted his own review of the game, which is also very similar in the wording of that.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:47.000
I don't know if he's just happened to be maybe copying styles of these other reviews or if he's just not playing these games and just reviewing them based on, you know, I don't know.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:57.000
But it's a pattern, and it's not a good pattern. That's not very favorable if you want to get into, you know, the writing industry.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Especially when so few opportunities are available, and I can't tell you how many people I know and that I follow online who have this lifelong dream of doing journalism.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:20.000
And journalism right now is really fucking hard because nobody's buying newspapers and magazines. I shouldn't say nobody, but far less than what used to are buying newspapers and magazines anymore.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Everybody's going to the internet where everybody ad blocks because, you know, because unfortunately, and I sort of think the ad industry is solely to blame for that, I don't think people would be ad blocking if the ads didn't get ridiculously intrusive.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Well, not only ridiculously intrusive, but containing malware and other shit.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:51.000
But anyway, that's a whole nother Oprah. But the reality is because of those reasons, whatever they are, because people have ruined it for everyone else and people are ad blocking, like, you know, there isn't a lot of money to be made there.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:07:08.000
So it's like it is really fucking hard to be a journalist right now. And those opportunities are few and far between. So to hear that somebody was able to get into IGN only to do this is like, that's kind of a slap in the face to everybody who's working really fucking hard to break into that.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:37.000
And like can't because they just the right opportunity just doesn't fucking come up. And it also goes a long way in saying, you know, I maybe I'm probably gonna regret what I'm about to say, but what it also goes a long way in saying like, what's the difference between these big organizations and the YouTubes that they do, and the podcast that they do, and their fucking opinions, and the independence and our fucking opinions? What's the difference?

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Well, this should probably demonstrate to you not much, because if this guy did a YouTube thing on Metroid Samus returns, it took this long for him to get fucking caught.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Well, yeah, yeah, this thing. Yeah. But he's done this multiple times.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:58.000
So when you come to me and say, well, IGN said this, or, you know, GameSpot said this, that's why sometimes I say, so fucking what?

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Those reviews, though, weren't necessarily on IGN. So the other two, the FIFA and the other one were on his YouTube channel.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Fair enough. So IGN was just the dead cells one. But, you know, it's hard, like YouTube and the Internet is a big place, and it's hard to scrutinize every single review out there.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:31.000
So it's just, you know, in this case, it had to be the reviewer that did the actual review in the first place, noticing that, hey, IGN has a review that sounds just like mine.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000
That's odd. And, you know, pointing it out.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:41.000
MXC in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, I do not believe this person's response to the plagiarism allegations.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:47.000
As someone who writes reviews, I very specifically avoid looking at anyone else's reviews, previews, etc., before writing my own.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I don't want to compromise my opinion, etc., or inadvertently use a similar phrase or reference.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000
With that said, it's incredibly clear that this is a case of plagiarism from the writing.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000
He did more work than a typical high school plagiarist, but things are still written in the same order.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:09.000
You know, and I do want to clarify something, because even though I'm saying what's the difference between IGN and GameSpot and all this stuff and us,

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.000
I do think there are some journalists that are doing a really great job.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:24.000
What can these journalists do that go beyond even maybe what, you know, independents have the time or resources, I suppose, to be able to do?

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:32.000
And to give credit where credit is due, and this is really going to surprise some of you guys, but it just goes to show that opinions can change, people can change, places can change.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:38.000
But I was really impressed with Kotaku's reporting on what went on over at Riot Games.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
And that was a big thing that just came out. Was that this past week, or was that two weeks ago?

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:55.000
But that was some impressive fucking six months plus worth of really trying to crack what was a hard nut to crack because they'd scared all these people into not talking.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:04.000
So I do want to give credit where credit is due, even though I'm saying, especially when it comes to opinions, reviews, things like that, what's the difference between them and us, not much.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:15.000
But when you have the resources, when you have the contacts, when you have that time to really try to get into it and get to the core of things, there are several people out there doing some very impressive things.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:21.000
And those are the types of things that journalists can be doing that are really, really good.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And I know I have spoken very critically of Kotaku in the past on this show, but that was also many years ago and many things have changed over there since then.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:40.000
So actually, I don't find them nearly as bad as I used to. In fact, I actually kind of like them, especially after things like this last incident with the Riot Games reporting.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:49.000
I thought that was really fucking well done. So anyway, and Dungeon Buster does clarify the Riot Games story was this past week.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000
It didn't make our list for tonight. Well, I guess I ended up bringing it up anyway.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Well, tonight's the night where I'm going to say things. I'm going to get in trouble. Ready? So do you want to know what my reaction was when I read that story?

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.000
I didn't read the story. Have you ever seen Sexism or something in the works?

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Absolutely. It's bad. It's bad. They really give, from multiple perspectives, documented incidents of how the sexism is kind of rampant in that place.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:31.000
And all I have to say is my reaction was I was really glad I didn't take that job that I was going for in 2012. That's all I'm going to say. Moving on.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:39.000
We got one more story to talk about. All right. Let's talk about Doom Eternal.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Doom Eternal is coming to PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and get this Nintendo Switch.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Yeah, because they had QuakeCon this week, wasn't it?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Bethesda loves Doom Eternal, don't they? Bobby Blackwolf spelling it differently in chat, saying Do-Maternal. Doom Eternal. Sorry if I'm not enunciating correctly for you.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:07.000
But anyway, Doom Eternal was shown off at QuakeCon, and it is going to be confirmed for all the systems, including Switch.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Panic Button is doing the Switch port. They did the Doom port, which many people seem to be pretty cool with.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:21.000
So I guess it looks like it's kind of just a sequel to Doom, but it's going to have some new stuff in it. And that would be the 2016 Doom, not the really old ones.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:29.000
There's a new dash movement, there's a blade, a super shotgun, meat hook. There's going to be more demons in Doom Eternal.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:35.000
And you can actually have players that turn into demons in another player's campaign. That's straight out of Dark Souls, isn't it?

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Yeah, or Demon Souls.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:46.000
And then they were showing some effects where, like, as you blow up the monsters, you can blow them up slowly. Like, little pieces of their flesh fall off the more you attack them and stuff.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:55.000
So, yep, that's a thing that exists in the world. But no, hey, the Doom reboot was great, so I'm pretty excited about the new game.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:09.000
There will be post-launch campaign DLC. SnapMap is not going to be coming back for Doom Eternal. Those were some other little tidbits that were shared at QuakeCon, where id did the big unveil of the game.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
So, that's Doom. Are you going to check out Doom Eternal?

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
I didn't check out the first one.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
What?

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I didn't even check out the first one.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:27.000
You should. It's very fast-paced, but it's very good. Especially now they have it on the Switch. I mean, the Switch, it shows a little bit, but it's not a bad port by any means.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I just play it on PC.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000
And honestly, that's nothing against Switch or any of it. It's just keyboard and mouse for me when it comes to those games.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
And Dungeon Buster in chat agrees. It's good, Loki. Give it a try.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Yeah, but you see, I have a library of 560 games in Steam, and, you know, I'm not going to play it. I can buy it, and I won't play it. There was a game I just bought recently.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:58.000
I know there's another big game that I bought recently, and I still haven't played it yet, so I don't even... I can't even remember what it is.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Well, I'm happy you just got to Horizon this week.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Yes, Horizon.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
That's one that I still need to play, so...

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000
It's great.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.000
All right. Well, we're going to go from newer games to some classic games.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.000
And thanks to the magic of radio, we're joined right now by the one and only Dark Sakura.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Hi.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Hi, you're here.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Yes.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000
It's magic.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
You took me on adventures.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I know. I'm going to take... Would you like to go on a journey?

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Magical adventure.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.000
It's a magical adventure. Just get in the van that says magic adventure.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000
By the way...

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Way?

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000
We called somebody at work today a unicorn, and I said, you're in danger if Tim Curry comes by in a devil suit.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
So let's talk about a classic game of the week as old as that reference.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Yes.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Because every week Dark Sakura jumps into the gaming vault.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Whether she's here or not, she will be here through magic to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, brat, play this, or I will...

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
This one's all sticky.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
I will send Tim Curry to eat you.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Don't let kids play arcade games when their hands are chocolaty.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
What's the classic game of the week, Dark Sakura?

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Robotron 2084.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000
So, also known as Robotron, because that's what we called it.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.000
It is an arcade game that was developed by Eugene Jarvis and Larry DeMar of VidKids.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
And whoever remembers the numbers anyway.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Yes.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000
And it was released by Williams.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Of course, you know, there's a lot more Williams things in my house that are pinball, but we'll not go there.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
It is a 2D shoot-em-up.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:36.000
And basically, in 2084, the robots have taken over in a cybernetic revolt.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
And you have to defeat the robots, rescue the humans.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
I look at this as kind of a precursor to Smash TV, to be honest.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
You know?

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Yes.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Because especially with the whole double joystick thing.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Yeah.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
It is the game that made twin sticks popular.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:56.000
It had previously been used in a game called Mars and in Taito Space Dungeon in 1981.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Although, it originated in the game Gun Fight from 1975.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
But who's played those?

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
I think if I ever did Gun Fight, it would be the second game that came out before I was born.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Unless, did Pong came out before? Yeah, Pong came out before I was born, too.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Yes, and you did Space War on one episode.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
The 1950 radar. You did the radar love.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
You've done some old stuff, Dark Sakura.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Yeah.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Well, anyway, this game is also listed as one of Jarvis's best contributions to video games.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
So, it's pretty, pretty notable.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
So, basically, you have a top-down perspective.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000
You just shoot stuff and try to rescue all the humans.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
You have different waves of robots and different obstacles that are in there.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000
And you basically just have to survive.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:42.000
And this is also, this particular game, it did feature mono sound.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
And it's a raster game.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
So, this was, like, right around the era that they were doing all the vector stuff.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000
And it looks fairly vector, but it really is a raster game.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
It was on a 19-inch CRT.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:59.000
It used a Motorola 6809 central processing unit that operated at one whole megahertz.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Wow.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Right?

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:06.000
And it actually had this neat thing where it used, like, this scheming programming

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.000
to generate sounds in order of importance so that it would sound like it was a multi-audio channel

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
when really it was monaural.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:20.000
It also had a custom graphics coprocessor that basically generated the on-screen objects

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000
and visual effects independently of the rest of it.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
And it could also transfer memory space so that the game would stay fast

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
and animate a large number of things at one time.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
So, this game actually is fairly innovative for its time.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.000
And some of these later stages got crazy amounts of stuff going on.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
So, this game took six months to develop.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Just six months.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:47.000
And VidKids was actually a consulting firm that designed games for Williams.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000
And Jarvis and DeMar did work for Williams before.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:58.000
So, the game was meant to be exciting, like an athletic experience that had a physical element with the twin sticks.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:06.000
And then it was basically meant to give a conflicting goal to avoid attacks,

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:11.000
to defeat the enemies, and to save a family to earn your points.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
So, it really was these contrasting things.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.000
It was also inspired by the Stern game, Berserk.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
And also a game for the Commodore PET called Chase.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
So, and I'm sure that I don't need to go into those games.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000
We pretty much know what they are.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000
And the dual joystick design was developed by Mr. Jarvis there,

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.000
who was inspired by an automobile accident and playing Berserk.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:42.000
He had injured his right hand, so he couldn't play the game to test it.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
So, he had to be able to use his left hand as well.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000
So, that's where the joysticks came from.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:52.000
He also created a second type of game like this to aim projectiles and things.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:59.000
And so, he created a prototype using a Stargate arcade system board and two Atari 2600 controllers.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000
So, it basically led to the game we have here.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Other things about the game, as far as its story, it was inspired by 1984, the story by George Orwell.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Although this, of course, game did predate Terminator.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000
So, who knows, maybe Terminator was inspired by this.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:26.000
But they wanted to do a more realistic time frame for the Big Brother theory.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Big Brother is watching you.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Of course, if robots do take over 1984, then I'm gonna say that they were pretty pathetic, don't you think?

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
And they also did all the play testing themselves.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Well, if I'm alive in 2084, I will be 106.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Girl.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:51.000
So, I mean, here's hoping, but I'm thinking I'll be too senile to realize it if robots take over.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:56.000
I'll probably see one of those enemies in this game with the brain that flashes all the different colors.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
And I'll be like, it's shiny!

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Well, basically, the game gets harder and harder and harder as it goes on.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
When are they gonna make a game that gets easier?

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
When are they gonna make a game that gets easier?

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
They should call it Be Rich.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
And the richer you get, the easier stuff gets.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Privilege the game.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:23.000
So, in 2012, though, Eugene Jarvis wrote an evaluation of the Robotron enemy dynamics.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:32.000
So the game is hardcoded with 40 waves, whereupon the game repeats wave 21 through 40 over and over until the game restarts back to original wave 1.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
That's after wave 255 has been completed.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:41.000
And so he actually put out a whole thing on there and gave details on how to trigger the secret room in Robotron.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
So, the game was great.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000
It sold quite well.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:50.000
It sold 19,000 arcade cabinets, and many cabs and cocktail versions were also later produced.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
The different versions have become rarities.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Cocktail and cabaret versions are very rare, while the upright cabinets are more available.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.000
It is one of the most collected arcade cabinets.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:10.000
And, of course, it led to, of course, all kinds of other games and different things.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000
It actually has an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:19.000
It was listed as the number 11 arcade game with technical, creative, and cultural impact.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:30.000
And it really, you know, the audio design on it, there's just really a lot going on for it.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I mean, I know I've already been into the technical aspects of it, but it really was, the simplicity of its gameplay was really a strong point.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:43.000
But it was kind of a technical marvel under the hood for what it did at the time with what it had.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:48.000
And you can say it's simple, but, like, if you're good at this game, like, you get gamer cred.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Because this game isn't easy, at least I don't think it's easy at all.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Well, and Eugene Jarvis, I mean, he also did Defender and Smash TV.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000
So, like I said, precursor to Smash TV.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.000
If anything, I'd say Smash TV was the spiritual sequel to Robotron.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:07.000
I'd buy it. They're very similar in many ways, especially with the twin-stick shooting and all that.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000
So there have been other remakes and sequels.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:16.000
There was a game called Blaster, which was the official sequel, set in the same universe in 2085.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000
It actually is a little bit more maze-like with how you have to move around it.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
And it's pretty freaking hard.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:32.000
And then, of course, there were other kinds of remakes for the Atari 5200, the 7800, the Apple IIe, Commodore 64, and the TI-99 4A.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:39.000
It also has releases on PlayStation 2 and Xbox compilations, the Midway Arcade Treasures.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000
There's a web-based version of it that runs in Shockwave.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000
So you have no reason not to try this game. Get your Shockwave on.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Shockwave is still supported.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:57.000
So, also, Midway was going to do a plug-and-play version as part of their line of TV games, but it never came out.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:02.000
So you can download it via Xbox. Well, you could download it via Xbox Live Arcade.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.000
And it was taken down in February 2010 because it had some permission issues.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
That's weird.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.000
I think it is on the Xbox One backwards compatible anyway, though, which is weird.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:21.000
So Jeff Minter, the other developer, did a game called Lomatron based on the design.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:27.000
And then there is another one that came out on iOS called Minitron 2112.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000
There's also Robotron 2.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Electric Boogaloo.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.000
It was a project that never actually came out.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:40.000
They were really working on it because Demar went back to pinball development and Jarvis went back to college.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:47.000
So they made an appearance. The robots in the game made an appearance in pixels.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Did anyone see that movie?

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
They also mentioned it in Ready Player One, the novel.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:55.000
And there's a modified version of the game in Fallout 4's DLC, Automatron.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:06.000
So they're also the world of Robotron 2084 appears in Lego dimensions in a portion of the level called All Your Bricks Are Belong to Us.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000
And there you go. Robotron 2084.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
All right. There it is.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Before we say goodbye to Jamie, anything else that you want to let the listeners know for the week since I know you don't get to sit in on the whole show?

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Anything? Pineapple is delicious.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Pineapple is delicious.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:27.000
I'm planning on trying to make every fourth Sunday to make it, but I have to have time off because I have to pay my bills.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000
But until then...

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Linda eats a lot, OK?

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Until then, Radio Magic.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Radio Magic.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.000
All right. Until next week, there it is, your classic game of the week, Robotron 2084.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Isn't Radio Magic awesome?

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Anyway, here we are on episode number 741 of our show for this, August the 12th of 2018.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Continuing on with our program here with just Loki and myself in studio.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Dark Sakura gonna be absent from the show here in studio for some time.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
But we do have Radio Magic, as we just did there.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000
So we'll be able to get her tuned in through Radio Magic.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:13.000
And hopefully, as she mentioned at the end there, fourth weekends of the month and so forth as her work can allow it.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:22.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase HIP.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news. Loki.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Yes, so Nintendo has confirmed that the launch of Nintendo Switch Online will launch in the second half of September.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
So they announced on Twitter.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:52.000
And of course, as they mentioned, the service will provide access to online play and save game data, cloud backups, incompatible games, and a growing library of NES titles that will be added with online play.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.000
All right, I'll believe it when I see it.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Give me some, I want to see the receipts.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
I want to see the receipts.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000
I will believe it when I see it because, you know, promises.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.000
I'm waiting, waiting to see it.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
All right.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:20.000
And then in movie news, we've got some more confirmations of who's going to be doing some voice work and in the Sonic the Hedgehog movie.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000
So Sonic is going to be voiced by Ben Schwartz.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:31.000
That's right, Ben Schwartz, who you may remember from various projects like Parks and Rec.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Or actually, he does the voice of Dewey on DuckTales, the reboot now.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000
He's going to be doing Sonic the Hedgehog.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
So that'll be interesting.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Want to check that out.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:59.000
And as we mentioned before, Jim Carrey has confirmed that he will be playing Dr. Robotnik in the upcoming movie and basically said, you know, that his portrayal will be live action.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Oh, boy.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000
I love Jim Carrey, so of course I'll have to see this movie.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
I still, there's a part of me that still feels like this movie is going to be so god awful.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.000
But like, then again, I just saw Mamma Mia 2 and I loved it.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000
But here's the thing.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000
When I saw Mamma Mia 2, I knew exactly what I was saying.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Like, people ask me, was Mamma Mia 2 good?

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:24.000
And my answer to that is, look, you need to know exactly what you're going to see.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:34.000
You're not just going to see a silly musical filled with ABBA songs to make you feel good and cry at the same time, but you're seeing a sequel to a movie filled with ABBA songs.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
So if you know exactly what you're going to go see, then it's fine.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000
It will meet your expectations.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:50.000
So I feel like Sonic the Hedgehog is one of those movies where I'm also going to need to go into it going, all right, y'all, I'm seeing a movie based on Sonic the Hedgehog.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Oscar nominee, it will not be.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Except, I guess...

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000
It could win most popular.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Yeah, I guess now.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Maybe it could because the Oscars will let anything in now.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Anything for ratings.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Yup.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Yup.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Yeah, I'll have to check it out.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:19.000
They also posted, I saw there was a post of a set pic that shows a sign saying, welcome to Green Hill.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Green Hill is a little town with a big heart.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Well, it looks better than the sign for a Schitt's Creek if you've ever seen that show.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I love that show.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
I was going to say, Loki, if you've never seen Schitt's Creek, I think you did.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
That show is hilarious.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I know, that show is so fucking funny.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Anyway, I need to watch more.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000
I've always seen like half the first season, but they're on like season four or five, right?

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Yeah, I kind of stopped watching that.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Oh god. But it's funny.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000
It is funny, yeah.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:49.000
It's like, there's great shows, like Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is funny.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I just didn't have time to really watch past season two, but one of these days I'll finish.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Anyway, let's talk about a device you can watch all these shows on.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000
The PlayStation 4 Pro. You can even play games.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
The PlayStation 4 Pro has hit a big milestone.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000
They have sold more than 500 million units worldwide.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:13.000
And to celebrate, Sony is going to release a limited edition PlayStation 4 Pro.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000
It's the 500 million limited edition Pro.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000
They're only going to make 50,000 of these.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:23.000
So you do the math on what percentage of the pros out there will be this.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:29.000
But anyway, they're going to be numbered as well, so I guess that kind of makes it even more, I guess, desirable.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
I don't know.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
What's also kind of neat about this, I mean, have you seen like the color?

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.000
It's really cool. It's like a translucent blue casing to it.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
It's a really pretty looking thing.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Gold lettering on it, and then a translucent blue DualShock and PlayStation Camera.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
So that's pretty cool.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000
So I might be into that if I had the money to dump on something like that.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.000
If I hadn't just bought a PlayStation 4 Pro.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:00.000
That's like when I bought my original Xbox with something like this.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000
I got the Halo Edition Xbox that was like a translucent green.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
And so it actually looked really cool.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.000
It was translucent green, and then the controller was green as well.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.000
So yeah, I guess they've been doing these types of things for a while, but anyway.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Yeah, and they have that special, there's like two that are going to be extra special on top of that.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Because of the dates that coincide with the launch of...

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.000
What did they say the extra special numbers will do?

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.000
They didn't say what, but it's going to have something else in there.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Alright, well anyhow.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:38.000
If you want to get one of these, $4.99 to pick one of these up on August 24th.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:42.000
If you want to just get the controller, you can get that for $64.99.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:47.000
And there's also going to be a limited edition gold wireless headset with the same translucent blue.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000
It's not part of the box set, but it's just something else available for $100.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:55.000
If you have that kind of money to spend, enjoy.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Anyhow, let's talk about Mega Man 11.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.000
This is a game you might be playing on your PlayStation 4, or your Switch, or your Xbox.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Or a variety of different platforms.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Apparently, Mega Man 11 demo is supposed to come out on Xbox One on September 4th.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000
A demo?

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:16.000
A demo, which I imagine would be a similar thing, like they'll have something as well on PlayStation 4.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000
They're doing console exclusives for demos now.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Yeah, I don't know.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:26.000
In the demo, according to the description, take on all kinds of enemies and traps in the block band stage.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:32.000
And use the new double gear system to slow down time or power up your shots and take down that boss.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
So it sounds like you'll be able to play a stage from the game.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
This is a throwback to Xbox 360.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Remember back in the Xbox 360 days when all those games had to have demos?

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
All the Xbox Live Arcade games had to have demos?

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:48.000
So I think because of that, if memory serves me right, Mega Man 9 had to have a demo.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Because it was on Xbox Arcade.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Because I feel like there was a demo where you could play one stage in Mega Man 9.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Yeah, they all have trial versions.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Yeah, so that's probably a similar deal here.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000
And Bobby Blackwell confirming he remembers there was one for Mega Man 9.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000
And Dark Tetsuya said, yep, I remember when it had one stage.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
So this will probably be similar.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.000
And I would imagine Block Man is not the stage you're supposed to play first.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
So it's going to be challenging.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Because, you know, every Mega Man game has its boss order, right?

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000
I imagine Block Man is not the first boss you're supposed to beat in Mega Man 11.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
So it's going to be even.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Wouldn't that be a twist?

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Anyway, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some full versions you can buy very soon.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Starting with the US, Loki.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Yep, this week we're getting Death's Gambit on PC and Playstation 4.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Tanglewood on PC, Mac, and Linux.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:51.000
We've got The Walking Dead, the final season, episode 1 on PC, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:56.000
World of Warcraft, Battle for Azeroth on PC and Mac.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.000
And Penguin Wars on Nintendo Switch.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:08.000
And State of Mind on PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:14.000
And we're only one week away from All Star Fruit Racing for Nintendo Switch.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Oh boy.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
But that's for next, that's the week after, so.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Alright.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Let's travel to Japan and then of course while Jamie's gone maybe you could fill in on the UK dates hopefully.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Alright, cool.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:33.000
So let's travel to Japan real quick where I actually, I don't really see a lot on Playstation 4 this week in Japan.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Because the next set of releases I see are all the way out in the 20s.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
So I guess that's it.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.000
I don't know if there's something going on in Japan this week, but Playstation 4 doesn't have anything.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Let me check and see if there's something on the Switch that is the reason why it's causing everything to be held up.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
No, is there a holiday out there or something?

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
I don't know.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Yeah, it's an empty week in Japan.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000
There's nothing on Playstation 4, there's nothing on Nintendo Switch, and nothing on Nintendo 3DS.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Although there will be, there are more Yokai Watch Blasters games due on the 3DS eventually.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:11.000
So, you know, there's still stuff coming to 3DS.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Well there's that WarioWare game that came out recently too.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Yeah, I hear that's pretty crazy.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Yeah, so anyway, pretty bleak week in Japan.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
How about the UK?

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.000
UK, we've got a World of Warcraft, Battle for Azeroth, Collector's Edition, and Dead Cells,

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:31.000
which is going to be coming out on Playstation 4, and Switch, and of course World of Warcraft on PC and Mac.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
And that is it.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Alright, let's get to the mailbag.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Every week you guys email us, participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Unless you don't, in which case last week we learned you all got a punishment.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Last week.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000
But we actually got, I think the punishment worked, because we got a lot of emails this week.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:06.000
But it's kind of funny what some of these say though, we'll get into it.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
So we actually have several emails to get into tonight.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.000
With Dark Sakura not here, of course I'll be taking over emails for a little bit.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
So Robert M. starts us off tonight saying,

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:20.000
I'm still enjoying the Switch port of Fortnite Battle Royale, but haven't yet invested in a battle pass.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.000
My brother's 13 year old son has generally fallen off shooters,

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:29.000
but interestingly, his 5 year old son plays it on my console when I bring it over, or he's at my house.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000
5 years old playing Fortnite? I can't even imagine.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.000
But I guess then again, I was playing games on the Commodore 64 at like 6 or 7, so.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:43.000
My kid's not playing Fortnite. I haven't thought about downloading it, but he's playing Octodad.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.000
He's been like, just tons of Octodad.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:51.000
My brother himself gave the game a try and confessed it was his type of game,

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:55.000
although his busy lifestyle doesn't give him much time for gaming, what with his job and two sons.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.000
If either tried to join me via mobile, would it necessarily work?

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.000
I do know the console says, play with same console on screen.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Would that change if I had a friends list populated by players with an Epic account on mobile, PC, or Xbox One?

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Also, is there any chance of the success of Battle Royale bringing the save the world PvE to the Switch?

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.000
I would say as far as your second question goes, I mean, anything's possible,

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:24.000
especially when money does a lot of talking, so I would think with as well as that game's doing on Switch,

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:29.000
I would think, sure, why wouldn't they bring the save the world PvE to that as well?

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:34.000
I don't play enough Fortnite to really be able to answer your first question. I'd have to defer to chat.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.000
I think that it would be cross-play, as long as you're not on PlayStation, of course,

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
because they don't play nice with anyone.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Yeah, he says he doesn't have anyone on his friends list that's mobile, PC, or Xbox One,

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.000
so maybe you have to add some people there through the Epic Games website or through the app?

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Yeah, I don't know about that.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.000
I would try doing that, add some people through the app, and then see...

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.000
But it's supposed to be everything.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Yeah, it is supposed to work.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Unless you're a PlayStation, because fuck everybody if you're on PlayStation.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000
PlayStation's on an island all by themselves.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
All right, thanks for the email.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Next email from Redertainment, who says,

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Dear Jamie, if it's not too much trouble, and I don't mean to pry or demand,

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.000
but I'd like to hear more stories from the Leatherbar. Thank you.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Stay care, Redertainment.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Well, joke's on you. She's not here to tell the stories, but maybe with some radio magic,

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000
I can pre-record some stories. She loves that.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Some stories in advance for when we need punishment in future weeks due to lack of emails.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000
It kind of seems weird that we're talking about punishment and Leatherbar at the same time.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000
This is going in a whole weird BDSM.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:46.000
I'll tell you what, though, if we go like four weeks in a row with no emails,

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I'm going to tell you about when I went to Chicago and went to a bar called Jackhammer.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
That's all I'm going to say.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000
It was shocking. It was shocking.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
What's that? You remember that?

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:04.000
I was going to say, you remember that movie, Bruno? Well, you know.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.000
No, I never saw it. I didn't want to see that movie because I was just afraid it was going to piss me off.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Anyway, let's move on and talk about the next email. The next email is from Brandon.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Hi, Brandon.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Hi, OLR. I love the show and have listened for about 10 years.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.000
That is an awesome accomplishment. Thanks, Brandon.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:31.000
I cannot express the happiness and comfort you all have brought me during this time.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000
You all have been with me through health scares, family issues, and huge social movements.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.000
College, moving, first job, etc. during this time.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
I wish I could express my gratitude beyond an email.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:47.000
I'm so happy you are still podcasting after so many podcasts have dropped off.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Thanks for all you do. And that's from Brandon.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000
And there's no questions or anything in there. It's just a nice note.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Well, that's nice.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Yeah, I know. I can't tell you how much that shit means.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Exactly. I'm glad that somebody cares about this shit.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.000
I shouldn't call it shit. But I can't tell you how much it means. Like, really.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Like, especially, you know, here's the thing, guys.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Even though you say in your email, you've all been with me through health scares, family issues, and huge social movements.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Something to think about, you've been there for me through all those same things.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
And with Loki and with Dark Sakura.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Like, y'all know I had a fucking terrible year last year.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.000
And if you were listening to OLR last year, you know what a crap year I had last year.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:40.000
But this show was, honestly, the first couple weekends, like, this show was the reason I, like, got out of my room or got out of my bed.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:50.000
It's like that constant thing that I have that I feel like my social obligation I have to do on Sunday. You know what I mean?

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.000
And technically I don't have to do it.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:40:01.000
But I didn't want to let you guys down. I wanted to be here. I wanted to do something to take my mind off of everything else that was going on.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.000
And, you know, I say me, but I know Loki's been in similar situations as has Dark Sakura.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
And, you know, you guys have been there for me.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000
So, Brandon, it works both ways. It really does.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.000
And so when I hear somebody who's been there for, like, ten years, I'm so fucking impressed.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
And I'm so, like, honored and thanked.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Honestly, somebody survived through ten minutes of this episode, I'm thankful and I'm honored.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Yeah.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Especially after Loki shattered all your speakers in part A.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Ah, they're used to it by now.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Alright. And thank you. You guys are talking some nice things in chat.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:35.000
She-Hulk says, thank you for doing the podcast. You do an excellent job.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Well, you know what? You guys do an excellent job of providing commentary in our chat.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000
And, honestly, live fact-checking. You guys are really good at it.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:46.000
In fact, sometimes it pisses me off how good you guys are. No, I'm kidding.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Dungeon Buster says, thanks for spending your Sundays with us.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Well, thanks for spending your Sundays with us.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Aw, group hug. Bring it in.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Alright. Let's go into this last email tonight, which comes from...

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.000
It's not signed, so I'll just say Jamie.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Not to be confused with our Jamie. It's a different Jamie.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Jamie says, just wanted to say that I really appreciate that you have a decently long show.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
You make the work shift fly by.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:18.000
But it got me wondering, is there some way to track back to some of your older episodes?

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Like an archive I can dig around in.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.000
I'd actually be curious to listen to the first episode of OLR.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
That does exist.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Technically, it's not something we officially endorse.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.000
But it's one of those things where I think it's cool that it exists.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:39.000
But I'm gonna tell you why we don't officially try to direct you to find the first episode of OLR.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Because it was a very different show back then.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.000
It took us a long time to get the polish.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000
And even now, do we really have that much of a polish?

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000
But you go to those first few episodes of OLR, they can be a little rough.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:59.000
And it's also tricky to distribute those episodes because we played music a lot during the show.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Because it wasn't podcast back then. That's kind of like what you did.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:06.000
We tried to make a morning show but on Sunday nights type of thing.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Where we'd have a little segment, do some music, come back to a segment, do some music.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:15.000
And because our show was so influenced by music-based games, we always had music to play.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.000
We were playing the latest DDR music and all that stuff.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:24.000
So I warn you, if you go chasing those old episodes down and they're out there,

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.000
just expect that it's gonna be a very different show.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
And here's the other thing.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Because this is what people do in the year 2018.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000
I'm not gonna take responsibility for some of the things that have been said on those earlier episodes.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Oh god, yes.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Because here's the thing.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.000
This show has existed for 15 years.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:50.000
And there are probably things I've said on this show, and Loki said on this show, and Jamie said on this show even,

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000
15 years ago, that probably wouldn't be okay to say now.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Of course, I tried to say things that were the most offensive things I could think of at the time.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:05.000
So, if you are trying to dig up old episodes to use that shit against us now, like, fucking don't.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.000
First off, no one's gonna give a shit because they're like, who?

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Yeah, exactly, who?

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:18.000
But at the same time, I would not be surprised at all if I heard a phrase on television, on Project Runway,

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.000
like, hot tea dash dash dash mess.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:26.000
I probably would've used that phrase here on the show because I loved Project Runway at the time.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:32.000
I wouldn't use that phrase now because I realize that that is, like, I've come a long way and I've learned

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.000
that that word is very offensive and holds a lot of weight to some people.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.000
And I don't wanna offend those people.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.000
So, that's all I'm gonna say, again, as well as to digging up old shit.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Because that seems to be the thing to do now to people is dig up the fucking archives from such and such day

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.000
and find the dirt.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:54.000
And I imagine, look, I'm not saying this as an excuse to yell at you, Jamie,

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:59.000
because I'm sure your intentions are very pure and very good and I really appreciate that,

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
but I just kinda wanna get that out there.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:08.000
If y'all are gonna seek out back episodes, we probably said some shit on those episodes that we regret saying.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:15.000
So, please do not come at me with, why did you say such XYZ thing on episode five and six?

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Because we were stupid then and we're stupid now and still learning every day,

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:25.000
but we're trying to do better with every day as I think most decent people are.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
So, anyhow, there you go.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:34.000
SSJ100Matt says, the first hundred episodes of OLR were very different, but the same humor and fun is still there.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Yeah, I think it was 138 was the magic number.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Was 138 when the podcast and the live show got married?

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:44.000
I don't remember.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Because for those who don't know the history of OLR-

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.000
It's probably on the wiki.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.000
It is on the wiki.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Well, I'm hoping Dark Dead Studio probably just knows.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Yeah, Dark Dead Studio, 170.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Okay, thank you.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:57.000
I think 130 was when we started doing the podcast concurrently with the live show.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
It was around that number, like 131 or 132.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Because for those who don't know the history of OLR, we were a live show dedicated to music games.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:11.000
And then when we found out about podcasting, we were like, well, let's do like this OLR to go edition that's going to be about all video games.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Yeah, because podcasts were like-

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Was brand new.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Ten minutes, like-

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Yeah, it was like 10, 20 minutes, you know, and that was, it was like, and so it started like this 20 minute side podcast and then it grew and grew and then fucking iTunes got podcasting.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:33.000
We were on it and that's when our show kind of exploded and we've never been that big ever since.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:37.000
But then it was like our to go edition started to become like an hour long.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Then there was a point where we kind of sat there and went, okay, so we have our three hour live show we're doing that has maybe 2% of the listeners right now that we have an iTunes on our to go edition.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:57.000
And right now there ain't a whole lot happening in music gaming because Konami wasn't making new music games at the time.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Guitar Hero had not quite yet broken through yet, so it was in that weird low.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:09.000
So we just made a decision. We were like, you know what, we're going to take our old format and our new content and make that one show.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
And that was the show you hear now.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:22.000
So that OLR started, I guess it started to, has it marked episode 170 was kind of the first of the modern OLR, I suppose.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:33.000
But I still think the years before it count, which is why I say we've been doing what we've been doing for 16 years and why there are really not a lot of shows that are able to get very close to that.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Because we did kind of have the jump by having a live show for as long as we did before podcasting was even a thing.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.000
So, anyway, um, yeah.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Dark Tetsuya says, of course, the very first week we did the podcast, they went and announced DDR Supernova.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Yeah, I'd like to think that was just really just so that Jason Enos could get at us.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
No, I'm just kidding. I'm making that up.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Obviously that came from, uh, actually it was really cool because we got to go to that Konami event where they unveiled Supernova.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.000
You were like the second person in the US to play DDR Supernova.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Oh yeah, I did. I had Naoki watching me.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Yeah, that was awesome. Anyway.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Cause everyone was like, cause I think they were doing, everyone was like playing Metal Gear Solid 3.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Yeah, cause all these other games were announced.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:16.000
I'm like, fuck that shit. I'm all over Supernova. I don't give a shit about your fuck.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Well, they had also BeatMania. That was the home version of BeatMania that came over. BeatMania US.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:27.000
But I was like, fuck that shit. I don't give a shit about that. I'm playing Supernova cause I want to play that.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Uh, Raginator in chat says, OLR so old that the host can't remember how goddamn old the show is.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.000
You're right. Cause YYR keeps saying it's 16 years by the way, not 15.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:45.000
You're right. I should know better. 15 is a rounder number for some reason. I keep saying 15. 15 plus. 15 plus. Fourth mix plus.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Um, and then uh, here's the link. If you really want to get to the old shows.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Dark Tetsuya has an archive up. It's over at bit.ly, like the little URL shortener, slash OLR chive.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:06.000
It's supposed to be OLR archive, but it reads like OLR chive. So there it is.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:13.000
But again, please remember all those disclaimers I gave you about the old content. It is old content.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:18.000
All right. That wasn't all of Jamie's email though. Sorry. We derailed halfway through that happens sometimes.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Um, so the second part of the email goes, Oh, and by the way, I'm not sure about the other listeners, but you can go ahead and pretend that you didn't get any emails again.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:35.000
I almost didn't send this one because Jamie's so-called punishment stories are a kick. Ha ha.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:43.000
He all better be careful because maybe next year we'll just get rid of classic game of the week and we'll just have Jamie's story time of the week.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:48.000
All right. Thank you so much for the email, Jamie. And thank you everybody for the emails. I really appreciate that.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:53.000
And you guys know that there's always going to be random stories of some sort here on the show.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:49:01.000
I just, I just really like to get emails. You guys, I'm also curious because this question kind of came up offline.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Is there like another way you guys would want to interact with us? Like, because here's the thing.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:12.000
And I know it's a weird question, but like, I also kind of also realize that email is getting a little more and more dated.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Like, I feel like people aren't using email as much as they are like Facebook messenger.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Right? Like I don't, I don't email Alan when I need to get his attention. I send him a message on Google Hangouts.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Or I text a friend or I use Facebook Messenger for some people. It's kind of weird because like I jump on this platform.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:36.000
It's called Google Plus. We're there. Did you know ORLR has a Google Plus page?

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Don't you remember the foogle question of the week, you old man? Man, we're on the same platform as Infowars.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Ah, fuck off. Alright, anyway. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, we use all dated stuff here.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:57.000
IRC, dated. Email, dated. Shoutcast, dated. Forums, dated. But now dated. Skype, dated.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Everybody wants to get us, get a hold of us through Ello.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Sia Tabiri in chat says, I'm holding out for the Scruff profile.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.000
That's right. ORLR, now available on Grindr.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Be sure to swipe right and set a date with ORLR.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Alright, anyhow. Look, we're asking a lot of these same questions and Bobby says all that stuff.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:34.000
But, you know, there might be a winky face there. Anyway, let's move on and talk about some more gaming news.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.000
We have more stories to get to. And then our ancient fucking Skype line at Orange Laundry.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Which, I don't, why is everybody saying Skype is dated?

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Like, I talked to you guys, like, a couple months ago about how I was playing one of those online Facebook survivor-y type of games, right?

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Because, like, it was my mystery project I was working on for a little while.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:51:00.000
And it all fucking uses Skype. And the people that played that game and the communities, they all still use Skype.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
I'm in, like, all these group Skype chats.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:10.000
So, what is the new, if it's dated, then what is the current way? Is it supposed to be through, you know...

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Many shows, especially in the gaming community, are using Discord in this day and age.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:23.000
So, what'll happen is that you'll set up a channel and if somebody wants to call in, quote unquote, they go to a special channel on Discord.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:28.000
And you can, like, pull that person into, like, your live call room and you talk to them through Discord.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:35.000
And I don't, but here's, so, like, I would assume some of the advantages of that is you don't have to add anybody to a contact list.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:41.000
It's open, it's public, it's easy to get to. You can do it on your mobile phone or you can do it on your desktop.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
But you can do Skype on your mobile phone or your desktop.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:48.000
So, that's why I always kind of like Skype, was that, and why I've kind of shifted to what you'll notice.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
I don't even give out a phone number anymore, because who uses that anymore?

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Plus, Skype is on some game consoles, whereas Discord is not on game consoles.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:00.000
It is, it is. But I don't know, but for some reason, that's what the kids today are using, is Discord.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:07.000
So, it's interesting, anyway. Also, to an extent, Google Hangouts, I think, still.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:14.000
To an extent. I think it's a little harder to arrange your live calls through there, but I remember a time when Skype was down for an extended period,

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:17.000
that we were looking at doing Google Hangouts as, like, a stopgap.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:24.000
So, I don't know. But anyway, our ancient fucking Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio coming up after some more news.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Lowkey, let's get back to gaming.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Let's talk about Bethesda again. Yay!

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:38.000
This time, I don't know. It's not a huge deal, but Bethesda is basically threatening that they're not going to release the Elder Scrolls Legends on systems that don't allow cross-play.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:42.000
That would be probably like, you know, the PlayStation 4.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:47.000
The Elder Scrolls Legends is a strategy card game that encompasses both single and multiplayer.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:52.000
It's both cross-platform play and cross-platform progress.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:59.000
But it would only be cross-play on certain systems. It is our intention for the game to come out.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:09.000
It has to be one of those things on any system. We cannot have a game that works one way across everywhere else, except for one thing.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:16.000
And the way the game works right now on Apple, Google, Steam, and BethesdaNet, it doesn't matter where you buy the stuff.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:19.000
If you play it on another platform, the stuff is there.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:24.000
It doesn't matter on what platform you play on. You play it against anybody else who was playing it at that moment.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:29.000
There's no, oh, it's easier to control, or, oh, it has a better frame rate on the system.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000
It's a strategy card game. It doesn't matter.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:40.000
So basically saying that, you know, they're talking to their platform partners, but those terms are non-negotiable.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:48.000
We can't be talking about one version of Legends where you take your progress with you and another version where it stays within that ecosystem walled off from everyone else.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000
There's your shade thrown at Sony.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Sony is going to break on this stance. They are under so much, Sony is going to break on this stance, and they're going to do it in a very public fashion.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Probably it's going to be one of their announcements at PSX, is that they're going to announce that Fortnite will soon be like cross playable with Nintendo Switch or something.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:15.000
They're gonna, they're gonna bulge on it because there's so much public pressure going on, but they're gonna do it in a fashion where everybody can cheer and go,

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:19.000
good guy Sony, and we'll all forget that they were ever the bad guy in the first place.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:23.000
I never forget. I never forget.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Do you? Alright.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Fuck you EA and your stupid online pass.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:33.000
YYR says Sony is under no pressure. Sony will do what Sony wants to do.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:37.000
YYR, have you ever read the replies to a PlayStation tweet recently?

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:43.000
And look, I get Twitter is not always the most accurate representation of society. I completely understand that.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:51.000
However, I do, I do think there's a lot of loud clamoring about Sony and the thing is some of this starts to get reported on in the press.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:58.000
And then you have things like this that Bethesda is coming out and saying, if Sony doesn't change, then we're going to release everywhere.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:04.000
I think Sony's stance on this will be, and I quote them, actually, I'm going to quote Bethesda here.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:09.000
It's a strategy guard game. It doesn't matter. So they're not going to fucking care.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Sony is going to fuck themselves the exact same way Microsoft fucked themselves when Street Fighter 5 got announced as an exclusive for what?

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Sony and PC. Just wait, there's going to be something like this that's going to come out and they're going to say,

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Oh, it's Microsoft switch and PC and it's not coming for Sony.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.000
And it's going to be much bigger than a strategy guard game.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:40.000
You joke. I know it's joke. They'll come through joke.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Anyway, someday. All right.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, hell, the Sony Fortnite story made it to CNBC or Fox business during E3.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:57.000
They interviewed Reggie and asked him about Sony and Fortnite. Reggie's like, that's up to them.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:01.000
You'll have to ask them. That's very true. Fuck those guys.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Anyhow. Um, YYR says a very vocal, tiny minority does not speak as loud as the millions of dollars pouring in from loyal PlayStation gamers.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Yes and no. Again, we just reported on Bethesda or you'll discuss Bethesda is about to not release a game on a Sony platform because of this.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:30.000
And maybe it's, Oh well, it's a card game this time, but what developer is it going to be next time?

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:37.000
I remember they have other games other than card games. They have like the other scroll six or whatever the other game there.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:42.000
But this it's there's Skyrim again. I'm just, this is what I'm saying.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:51.000
History will repeat itself except this time it's going to be Sony and not Microsoft.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Just like when the PlayStation three was first announced and it was Sony and not migrant like the history will repeat itself.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:09.000
I guarantee it. All right. Anyhow, let's move on.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Let's talk about torchlight. Why not? We talked about Diablo earlier in the show.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Should we talk about torchlight? Well, sadly, I'm not here to talk about torchlight three, but this sounds like it might be just as awesome.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:28.000
If not more awesome torchlight frontiers has been announced. It is a shared world action RPG.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:31.000
And of course it's the same universe as torchlight one and two.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:38.000
So this time the reason why they're calling it a different thing is because it is a shared persistent dynamically generated world.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:42.000
So players and their pets will hack and slack their way through the game.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:48.000
There'll be ancient ruins of lost civilizations and of course, loot, loot, loot more to come at a later date.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Of course, this game is in development at extra games. Sorry if I mispronounced that.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Runic Games and Blizzard North co-founder Max Schaeffer is behind extra games leading this.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:04.000
And a lot of the team is folks that have worked on Diablo previously and torchlight.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
That's why a lot of people love torchlight.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Gamescom 2018 and PAX West will be the first time to get your hands on it.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
So I'm guessing that's when more information will be out.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000
One more quote here from Max Schaeffer who says,

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Evolving the torchlight universe into a shared world has always been a goal for the franchise.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
I'm excited that we're finally able to make it a reality.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Torchlight frontiers will be a living, breathing universe that will still feel uniquely torchlight with our own creative spin.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:34.000
The team is building something truly special and we can't wait for fans to play it for the first time at Gamescom and PAX West.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:38.000
It will be available on PC, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Well, I guess we know that persistent world won't be shared between all those platforms.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:48.000
But actually, I kind of dig the idea of like a one world, one persistent world type of thing.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
That's going to be very interesting in a Diablo-esque type of game.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:53.000
So I'm kind of curious how that's going to pan out.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
And the torchlight games are really good.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Like, you know, torchlight 2 was a good, especially because torchlight 2 and Diablo 3 kind of came out around the same time.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:05.000
And it was like Diablo 3 when it first came out was a bit, bit turdy.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:10.000
So torchlight 2 is a really good kind of like thing to play while they were making Diablo 3 better.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:13.000
And then by the time you kind of wore out torchlight 2, it was like, oh, Diablo 3 is better again.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:16.000
So, yeah, I'd be very interested to see where this goes.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
So I kind of like that they're doing something a little different with it.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
So I'll be checking out torchlight frontiers.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:26.000
I hope those of you that are going to one of these conventions that we name check there will get to check that out as well.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Loki.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.000
All right.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:34.000
And then let's talk a little bit about Germany and what Germany can now do.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:43.000
So it used to be that any sort of Nazi imagery in games in Germany would have to be censored.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Well, now after pressure, I guess, from the German Games Industry Association, the government has relaxed their laws regarding that in certain circumstances.

01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:04.000
So now, long story short, they can go ahead and show Nazi imagery in video games again.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:08.000
So it doesn't have to be censored in the new Wolfenstein game, for example.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Well, I'm not particularly one to celebrate this news.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:19.000
However, I understand if we don't learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:27.000
So from a, I suppose, educational and historical accuracy type of, you know, place.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
So I get it.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Yeah.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:35.000
So that's where that symbol needs to stay.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
I want to make that very clear, too.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Right.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Yeah.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:40.000
All right.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Let's talk about Facebook and AR gaming on Facebook.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Now, I know when I say AR games, you might think about stuff like Pokemon Go, because it kind of like it sort of has like the AR mode in there, although I never use it.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:58.000
The only time I've ever used the AR thing on Pokemon Go is when you have to use it to get Mew.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Oh, you have to?

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Yeah.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
But it's not as bad as it sounds.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
It's just part of like the little magic.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
But it's very like Mew.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Spoiler alert.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Mew is a guaranteed catch on the third ball.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
You throw the first ball, it shakes once.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Throw the second ball, it shakes twice.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Third ball, you're always going to catch it.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:18.000
So it's just, it's just a cute little thing to do.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Yeah, I don't play with the augmented reality part on because that's just like...

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:23.000
No, it'll turn it on.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:24.000
It'll turn it on.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:25.000
I know, I know.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:28.000
You have to have a phone that doesn't support it at all to have Mew be a regular catch.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Because it's just like, it's like, hey, it's battery drain mode, you know?

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:33.000
No, thanks.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:34.000
Yeah.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Well, anyway, Facebook, because, you know, Facebook really wants to get into gaming.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Somehow, or it seems like, I swear to God, I feel like every six months on this show

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:45.000
we're like, here's how Facebook plans to get into gaming and then nothing.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Whatever happened to the competitive Pac-Man and messaging and stuff?

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
They have it, but no one gives a shit about it.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Yeah, I know, right?

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Anyway.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Because every time everybody thinks about Facebook, they think about, oh, hey, they're

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
stealing our data.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:58.000
That's true.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Anyway, or, oh, hey, that's where grandma posts all her racist shit.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:03.000
It's on Facebook, right?

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Anyway.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Pretty soon it's going to have to be Google Plus.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Anyway, going over to AR gaming in Messenger.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:16.000
That's where Messenger's going to be doing AR gaming in video chats on the mobile apps.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:21.000
So six people can play these simple competitive games and you can use your face.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:26.000
You use the little star button to pick a game and that will let you play.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:32.000
So some games you can play feature such soon to be classics as Asteroids Attack,

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:37.000
where you steer a spaceship around obstacles with your nose.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:45.000
There's another game called Don't Smile, which it's a fucking staring contest.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:48.000
It is a fucking staring contest as an AR game.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:53.000
So I actually think these games sound so ridiculous.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Don't Smile is what I'm going to be doing when I get a request for somebody to play.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Don't Smile.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Like, fuck off, you know. No.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Don't Smile is what I think about when somebody wants to play an AR Facebook game with me.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:11.000
No, but these sound so ridiculous.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:14.000
I almost want to do a live stream of playing these ridiculous ass games.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Let's see, there are also, there's more future editions coming soon.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Beach Bump, where you bounce a ball between players.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:27.000
And lastly, but not leastly, Kitten Craze, where you match cats.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.000
I don't know how you do that with your face, but I'm told you match cats.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
It's a kitty matching game.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Anyhow, this is all part of Facebook's strategy to keep you involved using the Messenger app,

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:41.000
because, as we just mentioned earlier, people are using Messenger where, you know,

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:44.000
email was what was used before, but now people are looking at other things,

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:48.000
like Discord, like Skype, like Slack, whatever.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:53.000
So anyway, yeah, I guess there might be some people that are into this.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:56.000
You know, if you're like 14, I guess this stuff would be hilarious,

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:59.000
but I don't think I'll be using it anytime soon.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Yeah, that's going to be a no for me.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
A no for me, dog.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Is anyone out there in our chat going to play Don't Smile?

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Or, you know what Don't Smile is?

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.000
It's a way for the government to watch you using your video camera.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
That's what Don't Smile is.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Don't smile. The president is watching you.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:29.000
All right. YYR in chat says, nah, I'd lose right away.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Yeah, with certain people, the minute their face comes on screen, it's going to happen.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Just come up on the screen smiling, oh, damn, I lost, bye.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Hang on.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
All right, a few more stories for you, Loki.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:45.000
So Discord is going to be launching their own curated game store.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
I wondered how they were going to make money.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Haven't you wondered that?

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Haven't you sat there wondering, how is Discord going to make money?

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:54.000
Like, everybody is using, like, there's tons of things on Discord right now,

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:59.000
which, by the way, guys, don't forget, you can go to vognetwork.com slash Discord

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
and join the official VOG Network Discord.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:08.000
So anyways, there's a new tab, I guess it's called Games,

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
or Store or something like that,

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
and basically they're going to offer games on there,

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:15.000
and they even have a program which is a first on Discord program,

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:21.000
which funds any game developers in exchange for temporary exclusives.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Exclusivity window usually lasts 90 days,

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:30.000
and there'll be some new universal library that will scan for games on your machine

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:34.000
and, I guess, boot the launchers for those games.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:43.000
You know, I have to say, the first on Discord thing reminds me a lot of the Ouya.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Because they had a similar program as well.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:48.000
They did.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.000
They did.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
It was the first on Ouya, and...

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:53.000
Ouya, that wasn't very good.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Ouya!

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Ouya? Oh yeah!

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:03.000
What do you think about the whole, like, Discord game store as a whole, though?

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Do you think it's something that could really give Steam a run for its money?

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:08.000
I mean, I guess it's early to be thinking things like that, but...

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:12.000
I don't know, I did notice that they switched it so that when you boot up the app,

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
which many people have when they boot up their computer,

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:18.000
now it starts showing you, like, gaming news by default.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:21.000
And it's kind of targeted at, like, the games that you play.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:27.000
So, like, I'll see gaming news, I'll see the common games that I play,

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:28.000
like a quick launch bar.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:32.000
I'm gonna tell you right now, this is a good thing for indie gamers,

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:37.000
or indie games, because I can put my game on Steam,

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:41.000
where it's gonna get hidden in that pile of garbage,

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:44.000
or I can put my game on this service that hardly has anything on it,

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
and it's gonna get more views on it.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Interesting.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
So I think that's where they have an advantage there.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Well, I just, I think Discord kind of backdoor their store into so many computers

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:57.000
by launching this as a free chat.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:01.000
I mean, so many people, because Discord is basically doing what Slack was doing,

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:05.000
but not charging anybody for it, and it has, like, all that voice chat built in.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:09.000
So, so many people are going to Discord, and as we've seen in the media,

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
and I don't want to get too far down this rabbit hole,

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:15.000
but even certain non-gaming things have started using Discord,

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
and some of them have been extremely controversial,

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:21.000
and Discord has rightly, you know, put the smackdown on many of those,

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:25.000
like, crappy things that were there, because I guess it would be kind of hard

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:28.000
for Discord to police what is gaming and what is not gaming.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:29.000
You know what I mean?

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Yeah.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:34.000
So, but anyway, but now, I guess Discord, to its credit,

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:39.000
by backdooring this whole store into, so Discord was kind of like a Trojan horse

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.000
this whole time, in a way.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:43.000
It wheeled its way into your computer as a free chat service,

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:46.000
and now, ta-da, it's a store, and gaming news and all this,

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:52.000
but with it being now a branded gaming store, and gaming news, and all this stuff,

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:56.000
now it's very much a gaming service, and hopefully is less attractive

02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:00.000
for things that have nothing to do with gaming that shouldn't be on Discord,

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
or anywhere, for that matter.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
So, anyway.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Rama in chat says,

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Slack is more for businesses than it is for games.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Yeah, it is, but I think about, like, you know, like, Ingressors,

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:16.000
I know, use Slack a lot, and I'm sure there's other,

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:20.000
I've seen certain other gaming communities use Slack.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:24.000
I know, like, certain development communities,

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
which I guess is kind of business, have used Slack.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:29.000
A lot of these things were kind of built before Discord.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:33.000
So, I mean, there are gaming communities that have used Slack.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:36.000
There was a hot minute where we were looking at Slack for VOG Network,

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:40.000
but it was, like, literally five seconds later, Discord came out,

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
and you know what the key difference was?

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Well, besides cost. That's a big one.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:50.000
The key difference was that with Slack, you have to invite people to it,

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:55.000
and that's, like, making people ask for an invite is going to turn away

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:58.000
so many people that are not going to bother to ask for an invite.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.000
But with Discord, you can leave the front door open and say,

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
come on in, party's over here.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:06.000
So when I say go to vognetwork.com slash Discord,

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:07.000
that's exactly what you're doing.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
You're just going to the front door and walking on in

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
because you're able to do, like, an open invite.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:15.000
And the fact that it's free is also kind of another big, big, big, you know,

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
selling point on that.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:22.000
But, you know, I get that Slack is also used in a lot of business type of situations.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:25.000
So, hmm. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:29.000
yeah, I live on Slack on the weekdays and Discord on the weekends.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Anyway. All right.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
One more story for you guys,

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:37.000
and I think many of you guys have seen this floating around the internet.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Have you seen this kind of like this meme that's out there,

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:46.000
this story about the man on the bike, the 70-year-old man, Chen San Wan,

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:49.000
old man who lives in Taiwan. He's 70 years old.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:53.000
He has a rig hooked up to his bicycle

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:57.000
where he plays nine phones at a time.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:00.000
I guess apparently, though, there is a setup that would allow for 11,

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
but he basically has them all strapped to his bike,

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.000
and you can see this in the little, I guess there's like a news thing

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:09.000
that's floating around that you can see this in him playing the game.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:13.000
There's a battery that powers all these phones on the bike, of course,

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:17.000
that will provide power to all these phones up to 20 hours.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:20.000
And I'm thinking, like, everybody's seen this guy in their town.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
I don't know about you at Pokémon Go raids,

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:26.000
but I've seen this person that brings, it's not on a bike,

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:29.000
but a fucking clipboard or a board with,

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:33.000
and I think the most number of phones I've seen on a board is seven.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:37.000
I've seen somebody bring seven phones on a board to a raid where it's like,

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:41.000
they could do this raid by themselves with all of their phones,

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:45.000
but it's easier to do it with other people or whatever,

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
or sometimes, you know, especially because,

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:50.000
but I was like, how do you tap all those phones at once?

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.000
And they actually showed me.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:55.000
If you face the phones, like, one upside down and one next to you,

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
so the ball button is at the bottom,

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
or it's just at the top in one place and at the bottom in another,

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:03.000
then you spread your fingers out like this,

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
and you go up and down the screen.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
You tap, tap, tap, tap.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.000
You go up and down your clipboard.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
You tap each one once really fast,

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.000
and that's how you battle with like six or seven at once.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Isn't that crazy?

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:19.000
This is totally violating the, you know, terms of service.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
I know, and like, as an Ingress player.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:22.000
Like, I get it.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Like, oh, it's so quaint that this old man, like, fuck you.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
I don't give a shit how old you are.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
You're fucking breaking the rules.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
But at the same time, like, I understand.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Like, here's the thing.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Yeah, the Ingresser in me is like, this is so wrong,

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.000
but at the same time, I'm like, you know what?

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Pokemon Go, it's a different game,

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:42.000
and I just, I just, if that's how somebody wants to spend their money,

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:43.000
spend their time, spend their life.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Better than them doing that and also, you know.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:47.000
I support.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:48.000
GPS hacking.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Yeah, I was going to say, I support that way more than I support GPS hacking.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
That's, you know what?

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
If you want to ride around on a bike with 20 phones,

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:00.000
at least you're out there on a bike doing it yourself,

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:03.000
and you're not, like, fucking cheating from your basement.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.000
So, you know what?

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
If you want a multi-account, go right ahead.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
In Pokemon Go, go right ahead.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:12.000
But if you want a multi-account in PvP games like Ingress, fuck right off.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
That's my opinion.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:15.000
Anyway.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.000
S2100mattinchat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:22.000
the one guy I talked to with four phones was an older man

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:25.000
who is playing on his kids' and his wife's account.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:29.000
They can't raid during the day, so on my lunch break, I play for them.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:34.000
And to be fair, there have been times where I've been,

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:38.000
especially when it was easier to catch unknowns because of the scanners,

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:43.000
I would be like, one time an unknown spawned at the old apartment complex

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.000
where we used to tape this show before we were here.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
Like, they actually spawned?

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Yeah, an unknown spawned over there.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Well, this is when scanners were working, so people knew that it was there.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
So it's not that far from here, right?

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Because we only moved, like, five minutes away, right?

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
So we got in the car and went over there,

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:02.000
and I texted one of my friends to say, this is what we're going to do.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.000
And my friend was like, log into my account and get it for me.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
And I was like, all right, I'll do it.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:08.000
So I logged out.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Once I caught it, I logged out of my Google.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:13.000
I logged into his Google and then caught it on his account, too.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:16.000
But do they actually spawn unknowns anymore, or is that just...

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.000
They do, but because the scanners aren't available,

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
they're a lot harder to pinpoint.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:24.000
People don't know where to look for them or find them.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:27.000
So they're out there, especially during special events.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
They're always out there during special events.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Yeah, I need to catch ghost-type Pokémon now.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Yeah.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:35.000
ActDeftInChat says, unknowns spawn everywhere.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:36.000
The thing is really hard to find.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
It's a bummer you didn't go to Capitol Park last week

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
because it was a Duskull nest.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.000
So they were everywhere.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Look for a Duskull or a Mistrivo nest because those two will nest.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
I don't know if Shuppets nest.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
They might, question mark.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
But Duskull...

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Gasliesel nest.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
I remember that was one of the last gen ones.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
Didn't they have, because I haven't gotten to the point yet

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
where you have to evolve either a Magikarp.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
What's the other one they want?

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Magikarp or...

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.000
You have to catch a Ditto and evolve a Magikarp.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:06.000
I've already caught a Ditto.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Okay.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:08.000
I've already done that.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
There's no other, like, massive candy.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Okay, I wasn't sure if it was Magikarp or...

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:14.000
No, it's only Magikarp.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:17.000
People are theorizing that in later quests

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:21.000
you will have to evolve one of the other 400 candy things

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:24.000
like Wailmer or the little bird, Swablu.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Yes, because I'm very close to evolving a Swablu.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Like, if I need this for, like...

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.000
I know, right?

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
Maybe I should just hold off because it's garbage anyways, but...

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Yeah.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Okay, ActDeft says, Shuppets do nest.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Oh, that's good.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:40.000
sj100mat points out they spawned, like, the Unowns at PAX East and E3.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
So I'm sure some of the people going to PAX pretty soon

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
will be seeing some of those.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
By the way, I am going to open the Skype line now.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
while we finish our Pokemon Go chat.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
If you want to give us a call and talk about anything

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
we haven't talked about yet or something you want to comment on.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:59.000
sj100mat says Lunatones are also a little random.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
That's one of the few things I don't have yet.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:02.000
This is fucking Lunatones.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:03.000
Those are hard to find.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Those are really hard to find.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
They spawn downtown, so, like, once in a while

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
you'll see a report in Discord.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Which, usually, I'm not looking...

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
I should probably join the Discord.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
I know, but, God, I'm usually...

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:16.000
I'm not looking at it because there's so much there.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Like, it's just, like, it's always full.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
They're always having to prune inactive people.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
So it's, like, you know, it's, like, full bust at the seams

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
of 2,000 people over on Discord.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.000
And it's, like, there's so much noise because of that.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:30.000
I mean, they have it split into 11 billion channels.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Like, every neighborhood in Sacramento has their own little,

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:34.000
like, subgroup.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:38.000
But then what I find happens is that a lot of the subgroups

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
then split off into their own thing.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:43.000
So the raiders here, instead of using Discord

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
and the channel that was made for this neighborhood,

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:46.000
they used GroupMe.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:49.000
So it's, like, I have to have Slack for Ingress.

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
I have to have Discord for other games.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
I have it for, like, Pokemon Go and stuff.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
I have to have GroupMe for this.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
I have to have Telegram, because now a lot of the people

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
that used to use Hangouts and Ingress,

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:00.000
now they want to use Telegram.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
I have to use, like, oh, my God, my folder of, like,

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:05.000
chat apps on my phone is fucking disgusting.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Anyway.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
All right, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:09.000
If you want to give us a call,

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.000
we have a call coming in right now.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Let's get to it.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:12.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:13.000
Who's this?

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Hey, Robert.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:15.000
It's Regenator.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Hey, Regenator.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:17.000
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
Uh, no, no, a whole lot.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Um, you know, you know, you know, a quick, you know,

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:26.000
gaming-related question, assuming that there's, uh,

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:30.000
time after the question, uh, quick PSA.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Okay.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Uh, subject was brought up towards the beginning of the show.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:35.000
Sure was the question.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:36.000
All right.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Now, obviously, uh, everyone doesn't have infinite amount of time

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
and energy to play video games,

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:45.000
but we still have an interest in gaming nonetheless.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:46.000
Uh-huh.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:50.000
That being said, when we don't have the time and or energy

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:55.000
to play games, do you guys have, uh, an interest in, you know,

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:59.000
making use of gaming-related media to kill, uh,

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
kill the time, pass the time?

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Uh, and if so, what is your favorite media?

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Gaming-related media to pass the time.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Yeah.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Interesting.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Like YouTubes.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Yeah, like, you're listening to, you know, game soundtracks,

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:20.000
watching Twitch channels, uh, uh, reading, uh, gaming-themed books.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:25.000
I listen to gaming podcasts, and my very favorite is Orange Lounge Radio

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
at vognetwork.com.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
It should be the answer everyone's giving.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:30.000
No, I'm just kidding.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Uh, but sure, gaming podcasts.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:33.000
Why not?

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:34.000
I listen to some in my car.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
I listen to, like, you know, Game Buoy,

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
and if I miss a week of Bobby Black Wolf, you know,

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
some of the other, you know, gaming-related shows here at VOG Network,

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:41.000
I listen to them in my car.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:42.000
So that's a legit answer.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Uh, Twitch, absolutely.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:45.000
And it's so funny.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:48.000
You know, I know I was talking about that whole disclaimer about,

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:51.000
you know, things change from 15 years ago, uh, to now.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Like, I remember there was a time on this show where I was sitting here

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
going, I don't get Twitch.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Why is Twitch so fucking popular?

02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:59.000
Da-da-da-da-da.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:02.000
And now it's like, okay, not only do I stream on Twitch,

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
and I'm an affiliate, but it's one of those things where it's like,

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:08.000
yeah, I really do, like, I like to watch people play games on Twitch,

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:09.000
like, a lot.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
It's like a fun little, like, just kind of,

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
especially when they just kind of want to, like, chill out on the couch.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Like, it's a good, it's a good, like, background thing.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Like, maybe what I'm really doing is I'm on my phone,

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:21.000
like, chatting or texting, but then, like, I have Twitch on the TV,

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
and I'm watching somebody play No Man's Sky,

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
or I'm watching him play Final Fantasy XIV,

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
or some other game maybe I haven't played yet,

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
but I want to see if it's any good,

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:34.000
or maybe my buddy Delvin, shout out to VG Realness,

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
maybe he's streaming Octopath Traveler,

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:39.000
and he's streaming it so much that then I realize,

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
yes, I do need to get this game,

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:44.000
and the little a-hole got me to buy this game,

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:47.000
Octopath Traveler, because of his streams.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:51.000
So that's, uh, that's, you know, definitely something I do as well.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:54.000
And maybe a little bit of YouTubes here and there,

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
but I think I'm more Twitch than YouTube.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
I don't watch a lot of the on-demand stuff.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Loki, what about you?

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
I don't watch, I mean, gaming stuff,

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
I don't watch a whole ton of people play games.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
I do a lot of YouTube, though.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:10.000
I watch, um, more, like, tech stuff than anything.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
I mean, occasionally I'll watch Dunkey.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:13.000
Dunkey's hilarious.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:18.000
Um, other YouTubers, um, what else?

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Oh, God, I'm trying to think.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:25.000
Ollie43 does a lot of, like, Grand Theft Auto stuff occasionally,

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:28.000
and will do Fortnite things and, like, MegaRamps and whatnot.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Um, so he's kind of fun to watch.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Um, CallMeKevin is another one I watch.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:34.000
He's pretty funny.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
He does, like, weird stuff in games

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
and has a pretty funny sense of humor.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:42.000
James Ski, but most of his stuff is just, like, garbage in VRChat,

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
and he's just kind of ridiculous.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.000
Isn't this interesting that this just goes to show

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.000
that G4TechTV was always gonna die?

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
I mean, the thing about, because people,

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:57.000
it's very similar to, like, the radio, like,

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
and I know I've talked about this on show before,

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:02.000
terrestrial radio is dying because of podcasts and stuff.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
I used to, I mean, I used to,

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
I don't watch, listen to it too much anymore,

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:11.000
but I used to listen to a lot of the, uh, Twit stuff,

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
um, you know, and the screensavers,

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:16.000
or the new screensavers and all their shows on there,

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:19.000
um, like the Android One stuff, I used to listen to that,

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
or This Week in Tech or something like that,

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
or, no, not This Week in Tech, out of their daily show,

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:24.000
I don't remember what it's called.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Um, but I do that, and then Linus Tech Tips,

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:31.000
I watch them, I watch him almost every single day,

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
whatever he releases stuff.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
By the way, Delvin heard me talking shit,

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
he just joined chat, and he's like,

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:38.000
you're welcome.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:41.000
He heard me talking shit, oh no.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Uh, quickly, what about you, RageNator?

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Do you do the Twitch stuff, or what's,

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
answer your own question.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Uh, well, I love listening to gaming soundtracks,

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:55.000
I, by God knows how many, I mean,

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
you know, if I were to listen to everything,

02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:00.000
you know, in one big playlist,

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:03.000
it would last roughly about a month,

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
you know, with no repeats.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
Um, you know, in terms of Twitch,

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:10.000
I personally don't broadcast all that often,

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:14.000
but I do like watching your Twits,

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:17.000
I mean, you know, when you or Bobby broadcasts,

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
I'll watch your channels,

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:24.000
I'll watch the God Comms main channel,

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:27.000
along with their, what's it been called,

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:32.000
their guest host individual and personal channels,

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:36.000
I'll watch those, and then there's a few cosplayer

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:39.000
related channels that I'll watch just for the sake

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:43.000
of watching those, so, but that's pretty much it.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:46.000
I mean, everything else.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:49.000
RageNator, I just want to jump in real quick

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
to answer some stuff that's come up in chat.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:54.000
YYR says, terrestrial radio isn't in trouble

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:55.000
from podcasts, is it?

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
The top 40 in news radio stations

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
probably aren't impacted too much, are they?

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
I didn't really get to finish my full thought on that,

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:02.000
and I've said this before,

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:05.000
is that where terrestrial radio is shining best,

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
where the other stuff can't really touch them right now,

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:11.000
is local news and local stuff,

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:14.000
and there's always going to be that available.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
As far as top 40 in that goes,

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:17.000
I suppose there's always the music

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
that's going to be at the dentist's office,

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
because the radio is always something free

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:24.000
that can be turned on at a dentist's office

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:27.000
or at stores and stuff, even though many stores

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
have switched to either satellite radio

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
or their own satellite thing,

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:34.000
or that's oftentimes delivered through the internet,

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:35.000
so that way they can play a song

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
and then have a commercial for what's on sale in your store

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
right there while you're in there.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
And I think there's another thing there

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
where it's like, if you can't beat them, join them,

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
because Bobby Blackwolf says terrestrial radio

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:48.000
is more in trouble from Pandora, Spotify, and so forth.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
That's why Clear Channel made iHeartRadio.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:53.000
They have an app as well as broadcasting on FM.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:56.000
And yeah, I have to admit, iHeartRadio is pretty cool,

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
because when it comes to the local stuff,

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:01.000
one of the things I really like to do on iHeartRadio

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:06.000
is that I like to go listen to radio stations in other cities.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Like, I think it's kind of fun to listen to, like,

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
the radio stations, like, in New York City

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
or listen to radio stations in Chicago

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:13.000
just to kind of get, like, you know,

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
like you're visiting somewhere else or something.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
I don't know. Am I a nerd? I kind of think that's cool.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Yeah, that's neat.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Yeah. Anyway. Anyway, quickly, Ray Jare,

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
no other people are trying to get in,

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
but quickly, you said you had some other type of, like, PSA.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Yeah. Now, as you mentioned before,

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:35.000
you know, someone had recently had, you know,

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:40.000
you know, serious complications related to depression.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:44.000
And, you know, personally speaking,

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:47.000
I deal with depression myself.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:52.000
The only thing I can say is if you have issues with depression

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:57.000
and if you see no hope whatsoever,

02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:00.000
you're in a lot of pain, so on and so forth,

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
please reach out.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:05.000
Be a therapist, your friends, family,

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:08.000
a significant other, whatever.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:11.000
I know. It's tough.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:14.000
I've been there. In fact,

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:17.000
I've had an incident last October

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:20.000
where I nearly died myself.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
I know how it feels.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
But, you know, sometimes it does look bleak,

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:27.000
but unless you seek out help,

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:31.000
you're not going to find a solution.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:36.000
And trust me, suicide doesn't work.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Very well said.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
A tricky topic.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
I wasn't really sure how I wanted to approach,

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:47.000
and I think Bobby did a very, very good job on his show earlier

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
if you didn't hear the beginning of the show.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
And I know this has been a topic

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
that's been weighing on a lot of people's minds this week

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:56.000
with the fourth anniversary of Robin Williams passing,

02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:01.000
as well as other things you may or may not be, you know, reading about.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:06.000
But, yeah, I mean, it's hard

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:09.000
because I want to give you guys a phone number and say,

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
if you're in trouble, call this number.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:14.000
But I also realize that sometimes when you're struggling

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:17.000
and doing that, like, the brain doesn't always,

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
you know, because when you're sick,

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
you know, your body parts don't always do the things

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
that they ought to be doing,

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
and so your brain doesn't think, I need help.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
I need to pick up the phone. I need to call somebody.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:30.000
So I hope, if nothing else, there's that awareness out there

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:33.000
that, you know, no matter who you are or where you're at,

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
there is somebody that fucking cares,

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:38.000
and there is somebody, and probably a lot more somebodies

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
than you think in the moment,

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:45.000
that want to see you beat the demons of depression

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:48.000
and want to see you go and do great things

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:53.000
and get over these demons that are holding you back

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:59.000
and be able to, you know, live a healthy life and all that.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:02.000
So I hope people feel like, when they're in these moments,

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
just reach out to someone, anyone.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
And if you feel like there's no one,

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
then there's always going to be these phone numbers and things.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:11.000
But trust me, reach out to a friend.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
Reach out to a friend you haven't talked to in ten years.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Trust me, they'll listen.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
And if you are that person,

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:19.000
it's on the receiving end of one of those things.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:22.000
Not that everybody knows what to do in these situations,

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:23.000
but you know what?

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Sometimes, all somebody needs is somebody to just listen

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:29.000
and just say, like, I love you.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:32.000
I care about you. Like, I care.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Don't do something to yourself because I care.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
So, I don't know.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:37.000
Exactly.

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:40.000
That's really all the thoughts I can process

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
and put together right now.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:45.000
I just, you know, all you listeners out there right now,

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
somebody cares about you.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:51.000
So don't, even when you're in the shittiest position,

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:55.000
please, please, please, don't do anything you'll regret.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
I don't have all the information,

02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:02.000
but I'm pretty sure that there is a nationwide hotline

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:05.000
that people can call you if you need it.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
And there's, depending on your locality,

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:11.000
there should be a local phone number for you guys,

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:15.000
people that call if you want a local phone number.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:19.000
Obviously, I don't have access to everyone's local phone numbers

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
to call for that kind of help,

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:28.000
but if you have access to a phone book, look it up.

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:31.000
Even if you don't need it for yourself,

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:34.000
have it handy just in case you have a friend or relative

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:37.000
or neighbor that does need that information.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:41.000
You can say, hey, I see that you're struggling.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:45.000
Here's a phone number that you can call.

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:50.000
You can talk to them or you can talk to me, that kind of thing.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:53.000
I'll tell you right now, it's 1-800-273-8255.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:57.000
That's 1-800-273-TALK is the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:02.000
That's probably the most well-known of those types of services.

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:06.000
But I know, for example, if the issues that you're dealing with

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:12.000
are a little more LGBT focused, I know the Trevor Project is huge

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:15.000
and a great, wonderful resource to help,

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:22.000
and I'm trying to look up their information right now.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:26.000
Pardon me, but this is important as I Google it live as we're here.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
I believe this is the number here.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
I hope I'm right because I'm pulling this off of somebody's tweet,

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
but it's 866.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:33.000
Yeah, I don't think that's right.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:39.000
I don't think this is the right number. Sorry, guys.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:42.000
Sorry, guys. This is horrible that I don't know it in the moment here,

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
but I was not prepared.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Luckily, okay, I found their official website.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Here it is, 1-866-488-7386.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Again, that's a little more geared for youths.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:56.000
So if you're a youth facing serious LGBTQ-related issues and you need help,

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:59.000
1-866-488-7386 is the Trevor Project.

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:04.000
Again, I also understand that giving a number is only so much.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:10.000
If nothing else, call anyone. Call anyone.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Don't battle it alone.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
I guess that's all I can really say.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:19.000
Yeah, as long as you get help in one form or another,

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:23.000
be it a call, go see a therapist in person,

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
speak to a relative in person,

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:30.000
or have lunch with a friend that you haven't seen in a while.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:35.000
Something, as long as you don't keep them all shut

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:41.000
and just try to put on a brave face for everyone.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:44.000
I've had the mentality before of,

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:47.000
oh, yeah, I'll put on a brave face and pretend nothing's wrong,

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:51.000
not to be a burden on everyone else.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:54.000
That only makes things worse.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:57.000
Just seek help in whatever way you can.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Well said.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
And I think on that note, I'm going to let you go

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
so we can try to get some more calls,

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:05.000
but I think that was a PSA worth our time, so thank you very much.

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:06.000
Take care.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:07.000
Have a nice night.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:08.000
You too. Bye-bye.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:11.000
Orange Launch Radio, all one word if you want to give us a call.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Orange Launch Radio, all one word if you want to give us a call

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:18.000
and chat about whatever's going on in gaming or what have you this week.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
Wow, phones are on fire tonight.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:21.000
Let's get to it.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Hey, this is Ronmo.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
Hey, Ronmo. What's up, buddy?

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:27.000
Not much.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
I feel like I'm stuck in a bit of a predicament

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:32.000
because I'm kind of following up with that call,

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
so now I got to bring the funny now.

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:37.000
No, we're resetting the palette.

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Do you want to tell a dick joke or a fart joke?

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:46.000
No, not really, but I just want to know.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:50.000
We need to stop calling this OLR at this rate, Ron.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:53.000
We need to start calling it Nostalgic Lounge Radio.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
Why is that?

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:58.000
I don't know. It just seems like almost once in a month

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
we talk about the good times, and I love it,

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:05.000
and we have to remind people that OLR is not just a podcast.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:08.000
We're a family, and as you were saying,

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:11.000
and I was coming home from my trip this weekend,

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:18.000
how the podcast keeps you going and how everything goes and so forth,

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:21.000
and it got me to thinking how you guys are there for me,

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:24.000
especially you and my times of need.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:27.000
Well, thank you. Happy to do so.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
That's what friends are for, as they say.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Absolutely.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:33.000
You know, it's interesting, though, because you kind of joke about

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:36.000
how every other episode ends up being a reminiscing episode,

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:40.000
but I think it's come out of our mouths several times tonight,

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:41.000
phrases such as,

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:44.000
if we don't learn from the past, we're doomed to repeat it.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:47.000
We also have talked about how emulation

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:51.000
and remembering the past of gaming, like, there is something relevant there.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
We do talk about the good old days. Why?

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:56.000
Because there were some damn fucking good games in those good old days

02:31:56.000 --> 02:32:00.000
and things we'd like to see again and things that we hope don't go away,

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
hence me reminiscing about The Guardian legend

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:05.000
and how that is a very hard game to play legally

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:08.000
in this day and age in the year 2018.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:11.000
So does this mean I have to track down another game pack for you?

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
Your mic is cutting out a little bit.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
I don't know if your mic moved away from your mouth.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:17.000
Try again?

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:20.000
I said, do I have to track down another copy of the game for you?

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:23.000
No, no, no, we're good there. I'm fine, but I'm talking about other people

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
because I sit here on the show and go,

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
y'all need to play Guardian legend and see what I keep talking about.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:30.000
It's not easy for everybody to just do that, you know what I mean?

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:34.000
I can't be like, go on virtual console and get, yeah, I can't even do that.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:35.000
I mean, I get it.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:39.000
I'm one of those who went to those sites to pull those games

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:43.000
because there was a lot of awesome Japanese games that came out

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:49.000
for the Super NES and Genesis slash Mega Drive that never came this way.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:52.000
And this was our way of playing them.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:55.000
But at the same time, I get the legality of it.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:58.000
And I had a brief tweet about this.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
Somebody was like, look at Discotek.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:04.000
They're going out of their way to track down this anime series.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:05.000
I forget which one it is.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:09.000
They're going through Sony to get the master tapes

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
and all that to do the series.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:16.000
Meanwhile, ROM preservation sites are being shut down.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
And I said, there's a difference.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:25.000
Discotek is contacting the manufacturers of the anime to get the tapes.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:30.000
These companies, I mean, these sites that are preserving ROM games

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:33.000
are just grabbing them and throwing them up there.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:36.000
They're not contacting the company for permission to host these

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:39.000
because they know they're going to be told, no, you can't do that.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:40.000
Pull them down.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:46.000
But it's not going to matter because it's going to go on the ground.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
There are torrent sites.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:52.000
There are torrents right now where you can just get every single Nintendo game.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:57.000
I understand that they file a lawsuit and stuff,

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:01.000
but don't they also have just the DMCA requests and stuff that they can just do?

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:04.000
I don't even know why we have to go through a whole lawsuit thing

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:07.000
other than, oh, we're going to make an example of them

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
telling them that emulation is wrong.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:13.000
They can put a DMCA request in, and if they don't comply with that,

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
then they can file a lawsuit.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:21.000
But I see a lot of these sites put that as, hey, yeah, you can report your stuff,

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:24.000
and then we'll take it down if that's the issue.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
I mean, I don't know.

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:33.000
The thing is these sites are saying that we host these as preservation and archive.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
That's their way around it.

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
We all know it's not an archive.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:41.000
And besides, with the DMCA, the site, their repository may be shut down.

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:45.000
They'll just go to another hoster or another bunch of drop boxes and Google drives

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:48.000
and re-upload all the files.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
Yep.

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:54.000
Hey, Rama, you know what one of my very favorite Super Nintendo games is ever?

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:55.000
What?

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:56.000
It's a game called Equinox.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:59.000
It was the sequel to a game called Solstice on the NES

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:02.000
that was a very unique kind of 3D perspective.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:05.000
It had some great music, and it was a really challenging, fun little game.

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Here's the thing.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:09.000
You will never, well, never say never, I guess,

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:13.000
but it is highly unlikely you will ever be able to play that game through legal channels.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:16.000
And I'm going to have to tell you, if you want to go play that game,

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:17.000
you're going to have to go download it.

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
You either have to find the cartridge, which is going to be hard to find

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
because I don't think they made a lot of copies of that game,

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:22.000
or you're going to have to go download the ROM.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:23.000
And you know why?

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:24.000
You know why I have to tell you?

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
Because it's never going to be out for you to play legally.

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:27.000
Do you know why that is?

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:28.000
Why?

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:29.000
Because of the publisher.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:30.000
It was Sony.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Well, there you go.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:35.000
Remember when Sony and Super Nintendo were making Nice Nice for a hot minute there?

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Because there was almost a Nintendo PlayStation?

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
Yeah, the Sony CSG Soft.

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Yeah.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:47.000
So Equinox was one of those games when Sony Image Soft,

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:48.000
I think it was called at the time,

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:52.000
or at least their video game publishing thing was,

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:53.000
and Nintendo were making Nice Nice.

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:54.000
Anyway.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:57.000
Rama, I got to wrap up because we got some more calls coming in.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:58.000
I want to try to get to everybody tonight.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:01.000
So any other quick thoughts before I let you go?

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:02.000
No, that's it.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:05.000
And if you don't mind if I show my podcast real quick?

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:06.000
Of course.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:07.000
Please.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:08.000
Awesome.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:12.000
We're going to be talking about Otacon 2018 tomorrow on Tuesday on Anime Jam Session.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:15.000
You don't have anything to say about that.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Maybe.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:22.000
I'll talk about my big purchase of the console.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:23.000
Okay.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:24.000
Cool.

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:25.000
All right.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
Check out Anime Jam Session Tuesday nights here at VOG.

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:28.000
Do it.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:29.000
Yas, queen.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:30.000
All right.

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
Good night, my friend.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:33.000
Bye.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:34.000
Bye.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
I see some more folks trying to get through.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:39.000
Please keep trying.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
I'm going to really try to get to everybody tonight.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:42.000
Hi.

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:43.000
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Who's this?

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:45.000
Hey.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:46.000
This is SSJ1 and you're Matt.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:47.000
So good to hear from you, Matt.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
What's on your mind?

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Not much.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
I wanted to talk about it.

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
You guys might have brought it up earlier.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
I might have stepped away.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:01.000
But I wanted to get your thoughts on how Pokemon Go Community Weekend was for you.

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:02.000
You know what?

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:03.000
Thank you for asking.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:07.000
Because when I talked about my gaming week, I completely neglected to talk about it.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:08.000
I did as well.

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:09.000
I forgot.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Okay.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:11.000
So no, you didn't miss it.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:12.000
Here's the thing.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:13.000
We just played it so much.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:14.000
I know.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:15.000
Honestly.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:19.000
Can I forget every week to mention, oh yeah, I played Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme too.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:22.000
So I played so much Pokemon Go today that I'm actually kind of sick of it.

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:23.000
So here's the thing.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:27.000
Because of the other stuff I had going on yesterday, I didn't really get to participate

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:28.000
in the Saturday day.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:31.000
So I actually kind of love that it was two days this weekend.

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:35.000
And I know they also did that because of the number of Eeveelutions that there are.

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:38.000
I wish they would just do it for like more than three hours.

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:39.000
But I did.

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:40.000
Well, they did this weekend.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
They did three hours Saturday, three hours Sunday.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Six hours.

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:44.000
I know.

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:45.000
I know.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:46.000
I know.

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:47.000
But anyway.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:48.000
All day.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:49.000
Anyway.

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:52.000
So I caught one shiny Eevee yesterday because I have this little Bluetooth.

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
It's not a Pokemon Go Plus, but it's a Gotcha.

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:57.000
So I think a lot of you players know what that is.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:58.000
So I have a Gotcha.

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:03.000
And between like the freeway and Melody's house, because I wanted to spin some of the

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:04.000
stops.

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:08.000
I got a shiny Eevee somehow because it was right about 1130 when I was getting over to

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:09.000
Melody's house.

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
So I caught a shiny Eevee on Saturday.

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:14.000
Today, I went down to Capitol Park, as I usually do.

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:15.000
It's one of the big hotspots here.

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
And I went and I.

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:21.000
So if you all are getting gifts, they're like Sacramento State Capitol or it's because that's

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:24.000
where I like to play.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:33.000
So I went down there today and in the first two hours, I caught one and I was like, oh

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
God, this is how this day is going to go.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:41.000
And meanwhile, Shane being Shane is like, yeah, I caught 10 yesterday and I'm up to

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:42.000
six today.

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
I'm just like, I hate him.

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:45.000
I fucking hate him.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:46.000
How does he have all this shiny luck?

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Does he have a shiny charm?

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:49.000
Anyway.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:50.000
But so here's the thing.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
So I started joking with my friends that I was walking with.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:55.000
I was like, man, I'm not going to get any shiny.

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
Pokemon Go is lame anyway.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:58.000
I don't care.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:38:59.000
Nobody plays this game anymore.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:00.000
I don't need shinies.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
So I was kind of like doing that whole thing.

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:05.000
Like I wasn't serious, but I was, you know, kind of doing that whole thing.

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:06.000
And then I shit you not.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:11.000
After my complaining fest, we start walking from where we're at to Starbucks to get a

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:12.000
drink because it's kind of hot here right now.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:16.000
I caught in the scope of 20 minutes and I'm not exaggerating this.

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:20.000
Six shiny EVs in 20 minutes.

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:24.000
Like it got to the point where like I pull up the first one.

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:25.000
I'm like, oh, haha.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Complaining works.

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:27.000
I got another one.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:28.000
I pull up the second one.

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:29.000
Wow.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Complaining really works.

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:31.000
I pull up the third one.

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:34.000
Hey guys, maybe you want to start complaining loudly about the game too because there's

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:35.000
something to this.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:39.000
And like as we're standing in line at Starbucks, I'm tapping on the EVs at Starbucks.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
I catch two while we're at Starbucks.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:45.000
I show my friends my phone and they're like, what the fuck, dude?

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:47.000
What are you doing?

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
And I'm like, I don't know.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:52.000
Like even I admit this is ridiculous.

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:53.000
Yeah.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:56.000
So I ended the whole event with eight shiny EVs and so I was very happy.

02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Now, of course, I started evolving all but two because obviously I'm going to walk the

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
two so I get Espeon and Umbreon.

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:10.000
And of course, as I evolve them, I get three Flareons and two, three Flareons and two Vaporeons.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:11.000
No Jolteons.

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:12.000
Yeah.

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:16.000
But that's why they do trading because my friend really wanted a Vaporeon and he got

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:17.000
four Jolteons.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:20.000
So that's what trading is for.

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:23.000
So, yeah, no, like my weekend was kind of similar.

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:30.000
Like the first day, like I caught, I only got like one or two in the first hour, first

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:31.000
two and a half hours.

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:35.000
The last half hour of it, I caught six after that.

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:36.000
Okay.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:37.000
So you had similar luck.

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:38.000
Yeah.

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Yes.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Yes.

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:41.000
Similar luck.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
Somewhat similar too.

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:46.000
Like I caught ten today and previously I caught eight.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:47.000
Wow.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:50.000
So you have enough EVs to start thinking about gen four stuff.

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:54.000
See, that's my problem is I can't really think about gen four because I barely have

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:57.000
enough to get me through gens one, two and three, you know?

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:58.000
Yeah.

02:40:58.000 --> 02:40:59.000
Yeah.

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:04.000
And I know this is like they've, so people have kind of been saying like there's a

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:10.000
maybe a little bit of method to the shinies popping up saying like, oh, if you click on

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:15.000
the first, the one that pops up, you get you, you're more likely to get a shiny.

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:20.000
There's other talk of people saying like if you go into a less densely populated area,

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
you're more apt to get more shinies.

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:28.000
I can confirm that that's bullshit all around because I got zero shinies and I was playing

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:33.000
in very undense populated areas and I played for a long time and I got jack shit.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:34.000
Yeah.

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:39.000
So I don't know if there's anything to that, but no.

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:45.000
So I kind of like them doing this whole weekend thing because I think it just works for everybody's

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:46.000
schedule.

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:51.000
It's like, so I'm curious what they're going to do for the next one because you know, we

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:54.000
were getting like Bulbasaur, Charmander or Squirtle.

02:41:54.000 --> 02:42:01.000
So, you know, the obvious choice for the next community day would be Chikorita, right?

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
Gen two is grass starter, right?

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:04.000
Yeah.

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:05.000
They were, yeah.

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
The things that I was reading, it's like, it could be like Ralts.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
It could be like Chikorita could be Totodile.

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:10.000
Yeah.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:11.000
It could be anything really.

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:17.000
And I wonder could they, could they unveil gen four starting during the community day?

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:20.000
Well, they were supposed, the thought was that they were going to do that this time,

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:21.000
but they didn't.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:22.000
Yeah.

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:29.000
Well, I saw like a weird tweet go out about how they're kind of starting to promote Celebi

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:33.000
as you know, the next mythical research.

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:34.000
Mm hmm.

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Well, because actually, um, Shane already has a Celebi because he went to go fest.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:41.000
So all the people who went to go fest got to do the quest there.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:42.000
Yeah.

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:43.000
Yeah.

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
So I think they're kind of maybe getting towards that.

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:46.000
Yeah.

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:49.000
I think, like, I think the Celebi quests are going to, like, they're going to pull the

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
curtain back on that in the next couple of weeks.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:52.000
I really think so.

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
Uh, obviously we know we're getting Reggie rock next week.

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:57.000
Um, so I think Celebi will come soon after that.

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
Probably, you know, close enough to Labor Day.

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:03.000
I'm curious if there's going to be an event going on over Labor Day weekend, but I think

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:08.000
that is when Japan has their, cause you know, Europe had an event, the U S had an event.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:12.000
I think Japan's event is over Labor Day weekend and that's going to be interesting cause I'll

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:16.000
be at dragon con, but that is when shiny wingle is expected to debut.

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:17.000
Yeah.

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:24.000
So I, so I wondered like, so they, so Niantic did a little cross promotion thing with Paxi,

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:25.000
with Paxis.

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:29.000
They had pretty much unknowns drop all around the Harbor area.

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:30.000
Mm hmm.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:35.000
And then E3, they had, uh, unknowns drop around there.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:40.000
So I wonder, like, it could be possible they could do it at a dragon con.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
I would love it if they did it at dragon con.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:46.000
I don't know if they will cause dragon con is, if I remember right, Bobby, correct me

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:50.000
if I'm wrong, but I think dragon con is still a hundred percent fan run and it seems like

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:54.000
it's more the commercial stuff that gets the big, uh, unknowns like comic con and packs

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:59.000
and stuff are all, you know, cause remember the guys at Pax sold Pax expo a while ago.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:03.000
Uh, so because dragon con is still fan run, they probably don't exactly know who to call

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:04.000
it Niantic.

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:10.000
Uh, but I know, uh, our buddy Charles from the Pokemon go podcast, who is a big part

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
of the podcasting track at dragon con.

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
A big part of the reason why I'm able to do as much as I am.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:15.000
So a big thanks to him.

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:18.000
Uh, I, I know he's pushing for that and he would love that.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:19.000
So I, I don't know.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:20.000
We'll see.

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:24.000
I would love it if dragon con would get the unknowns, but I'm not, not going to hold my

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:25.000
breath.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:29.000
And, uh, Bobby black golf also theorizing Niantic is probably doing it with packs prime

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:30.000
or packs west.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:34.000
I guess they stopped calling it packs prime packs west because it's at the same time.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:35.000
That's right.

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:36.000
Yep.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:37.000
That I could, I, you know what?

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:38.000
I believe that.

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:39.000
All right.

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
Well to my number six best friend, I'm going to have to let you go.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
I just, I just checked my list.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:44.000
So here's the current ranking.

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:50.000
My, my buddy Kyle in Toronto is the only person that I have exchanged or done a gift with

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
every single day since this rolled out.

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:53.000
So he's my number one.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
Act deft is number two.

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Ooh.

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
My old roommate, John is number three.

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:01.000
Uh, one of my ingress buddies is number four, a Panda, we call him.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
And then Loki's number five.

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:04.000
And then you're number six.

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
And I, and I just friended Loki.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:10.000
So now, so now I can kind of stagger that, uh, friend bonus.

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:11.000
Nice.

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:16.000
But I'm sure some, I'm sure someday we'll, we'll be able to do trades as best friends.

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:17.000
Yes.

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:18.000
That'll, that'll be great.

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:19.000
That's the whole reason to do it.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:20.000
Yeah, for sure.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:23.000
Um, the thing about shinies, they cost an arm and a leg to trade.

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:26.000
If you don't have them, they, they, they go with the legendary costs.

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:29.000
So if you're not three or four star friends, forget it.

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:30.000
Yeah.

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:31.000
All right.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:32.000
All right.

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:33.000
My friend, I'm gonna let you go.

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:34.000
All right.

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:35.000
Take care.

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:36.000
Take care.

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:37.000
Thank you.

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:38.000
Yep.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:39.000
Well, weren't they supposed to be doing, um, like some sort of treating one more chance

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:40.000
to get in.

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:41.000
I saw somebody else calling.

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:42.000
I'd really love to get on it.

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:43.000
One more chance to get an orange.

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:46.000
I was going to cost less to do trades for awhile.

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:49.000
They are doing an event right now where you get more candy from it.

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:54.000
Oh, so like I traded somebody today, like I had a slack off that I caught in Chicago

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:58.000
and I traded it for just another slack off so we could get thousands of kilometers of

02:45:58.000 --> 02:45:59.000
distance.

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:05.000
And I got six slack off candies, which was all I needed to evolve my, uh, slacking my,

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:08.000
what, which is actually my second slacking, but this one is appraised as a wonder.

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
So it's going to be a better slacking.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:11.000
Mm hmm.

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:14.000
So cause those, those guys are kind of Jim beasts.

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:15.000
So that's kind of fun.

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:19.000
S2100 Matt says they did have that event where it was 25% less starters to trade.

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
I didn't even really, I must've missed it.

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:22.000
I haven't been doing a lot of trading.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:25.000
Today was actually the first day I got a lucky Pokemon.

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
I have not gotten one of those either.

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:30.000
The only, and it was a, what did I trade for it?

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
I gave him something.

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
Oh, we did a distance trade.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:41.000
So, so there's a buddy in, um, Australia that I have and uh, let me, um, high collar.

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:42.000
I'll get to you in just a minute.

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:47.000
So, um, there's a, there's a friend that I have in Australia that I think is a listener to the show.

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
So shout out to a Clover Nikon if you're there.

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:53.000
So, uh, he sends presents from Australia.

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:58.000
So I opened an egg cause the eggs are attached to where your friends are when they send them to you.

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
So this egg was Australia.

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
So my friend today was like, Oh, I want to trade for distance.

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:05.000
And I'm like, Oh, well I have this, you know, it's just a Sandshrew or something.

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:06.000
It wasn't something I need to hang onto.

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
So I'm like, I have this Sandshrew, but it's from Australia.

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:11.000
So if you don't have your bronze medal yet, you'll get it off this.

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
It's going to be like thousands of kilometers.

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:17.000
So, uh, he gave me the Arcanine or whatever that thing is called.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:21.000
He gave me that Arcanine. No, that would be a spider Arcanine.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:24.000
So, um, uh, he traded that.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:27.000
He's just like, I just have this throwaway thing from like Costa Mesa when I was on a trip.

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
So we traded that.

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:35.000
And when that came over, not only did the stats go up so that it was a wonder for me, it was high appraisal,

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
but then it was a lucky Pokemon.

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:40.000
So I know those fire, they're fire dark doggies.

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:43.000
They're not like the greatest Pokemon, but they're not, they don't suck.

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:46.000
Like they're, they're, they'll hold their own in raids if you need them.

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
Anyway, I got a call or I'm making wait.

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
So let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Mountain Radio. Who's this?

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:54.000
Hi, it's YYR trying to be very quiet.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:57.000
No, I know you have a new baby.

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
So, uh, congrats and everything.

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:05.000
Your, your baby is not that far apart in age from the baby I went to visit yesterday who just hit three months.

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:08.000
So, so what's up buddy?

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:17.000
Oh, well, I mean, first of all, I just want to let any prospective parents know it is a lot.

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
It's a lot of work.

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
It's a lot to have to handle.

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:24.000
Loki is not all the, you know, shiny rainbows and all that.

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:27.000
So Loki doesn't get better when the kids get turned seven years old.

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:32.000
No, it gets different, right?

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:33.000
They just whine more.

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:38.000
They whine more. They're able to verbalize their problems a lot more.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:43.000
Yeah. Everyone just says it gets better. It gets better. I'm convinced it probably just gets different.

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:44.000
It gets better.

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:45.000
At least until, you know, they turn 18.

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:49.000
Yeah. I was like, it gets better when they turn 18 and they move out.

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:52.000
My wife is nodding.

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:55.000
No, but I think it's great. You guys made a child. That's amazing.

02:48:55.000 --> 02:49:01.000
You know, kids aren't for everyone. Alan and I decided a long time ago it's not for us, but we love cats and we have cats.

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:04.000
Hey, if you can come to an agreement, that's the best thing.

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
Absolutely. Absolutely.

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:12.000
So I know you didn't just want to talk about babies solely tonight. What else did you want to talk about?

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:18.000
Well, first of all, the Bethesda Sony thing that you touched on earlier.

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:19.000
Yeah.

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:33.000
So I really think that Sony is in one of those sorts of positions where, you know, doubling down, they think, is going to look better to them than changing course.

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:37.000
I don't know why I get that impression, but that's just the impression that I get.

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:46.000
I have a feeling that they would rather double down than say, oh, you know, we're going to reverse position and play nice with everybody now.

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:49.000
I don't know why I feel that way, but I just, that's the feeling that I get.

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:54.000
Yeah, but the problem is it bit Microsoft in the butt eventually. It's going to bite Sony in the butt eventually, too.

02:49:54.000 --> 02:50:00.000
I know, I know, you know, because we were talking a little bit in the chat and so forth, and I know, you know, guys on Twitter are whatever.

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:11.000
It's not a big deal, but it's like, you know, when you start hearing more stories like this, when the press starts doing more reporting, when the business journal is asking Resi Fizame about, you know, this stuff.

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:21.000
I think it is starting to hit the mainstream press, like that noise is going to come to a point and it is going to start to affect Sony when they start talking about things like PlayStation 5.

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:29.000
You know, that's, that's when Microsoft really had to pay the piper was that people really shredded them when it came to the Xbox One. You know what I mean?

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:30.000
So if Sony doesn't kind of...

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:36.000
Yeah, I mean, it may, but you're also comparing Xbox with PlayStation and here's the thing.

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:44.000
So Microsoft had to really claw and tear their way to where they got with the 360.

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:57.000
As it is worldwide, even at the height of the 360's popularity, PlayStation was still much more popular in Europe, much more popular in Asia.

02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:05.000
And, you know, they basically have the dominant world position when it comes to gaming as a brand.

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:15.000
I don't think there, any bad will that comes from this, I don't think it would hurt them as much as it would hurt Microsoft in the long run.

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:24.000
I think that they have enough loyal players, loyal fans that this is barely going to register on their radar.

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:33.000
I would, you know what, I will concede this point because you do bring up a really good point about the global market and Microsoft doesn't matter in Japan.

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:37.000
There are not, I get that the Xbox One is sold there, it's a non-issue in Japan.

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:41.000
So Sony can get away with this in Japan a hundred percent.

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
Sony can get away with this a hundred percent.

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:53.000
But I mean, but also now we're talking about the Nintendo Switch and PC and I think as the Switch starts to grow, if the Switch can kind of cross play with some things, I mean, I don't know.

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:57.000
It's going to be interesting. I still think it's going to kind of come to a point eventually.

02:51:57.000 --> 02:52:03.000
Especially if Sony just kind of continues this sort of attitude that led to this decision.

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:13.000
You know, I think that's also part of what really defeated Microsoft is that they kind of went in there unveiling the Xbox One thinking we're going to do all these things that the gamers want.

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:17.000
And it was just, it was just too early and it was really miss sold.

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:21.000
I think they had, we all know they had a horrible person at home.

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:27.000
Yeah, at the end of the day though, it's like, okay, so the PS4 has no backwards compatibility.

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:30.000
So you still can't change your name on PSN.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:35.000
So, I mean, there's a lot of ways, services where Microsoft exceeds Sony.

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:44.000
It doesn't matter. PlayStation 4 has the exclusives and, you know, the global fan base.

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:48.000
And once again, it's there in the position of dominance right now.

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:52.000
And I don't think they need to worry about these things as much if they don't want to.

02:52:52.000 --> 02:53:03.000
I mean, yeah, it would be the nice friendly, player friendly thing to do to open up their this and that and the other thing and to add all those features I mentioned.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:14.000
But, I mean, unless someone lights a fire under them and I don't think it's going to be Nintendo because I'm still convinced that the Switch is not direct competition to the PS4.

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:18.000
So, no, I don't, I don't think that either.

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:24.000
But I think, I think ultimately it's going to be companies like Bethesda over here that are going to end up lighting that fire.

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:28.000
And, you know, sure, you know, the card game is whatever.

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:30.000
It's not going to be something that affects a ton of people.

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:40.000
But when it's Street Fighter 5, you know, or Street Fighter 6, should I say, or, or whatever, like Fortnite 2, or even as Loki says, very tongue in cheek Minecraft 2.

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:44.000
Although that's a whole nother issue since we all know Microsoft runs the Minecraft ship now.

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:50.000
I think they would do very well to, to conveniently not release on Sony's platform for a few months.

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:51.000
I think they would.

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
I'm sorry, it's just, you know, that's business.

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:57.000
Wanted to do, you know, cross play and you just want to play.

02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:04.000
But anyway, all right, I do, I do still appreciate your viewpoint, your thoughts, especially, you know, you do bring us some very good points with the global market.

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
I think sometimes we forget.

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000
So, yeah, I mean, we'll see how this plays out.

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:14.000
I think, yeah, I'm excited as a spectator to see how, how this plays out, how all of it goes and what happens.

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:15.000
For sure.

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up though.

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:20.000
But take care and it's always, it's good as always to hear from you.

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:22.000
Hey, no problem.

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:24.000
I'll just mention one quick thing on the way out.

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:25.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:32.000
I'm not making any official announcements yet, but I've started working on bungee ferret tossing again.

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:35.000
You may or may not see it on Steam before the end of the year.

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:36.000
Yay!

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:37.000
That makes me excited.

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:41.000
Yeah, you can always put it on a Discord Steam store there.

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:42.000
Also.

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:43.000
Don't pay money.

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:50.000
I have noticed that super multitasking has been getting some updates and, you know, I read your changelog and I can see what you're kind of doing.

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
You've kind of going back and addressing a few things.

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:57.000
You obviously have been distracted for a few months by the baby, which everybody completely understands and respects.

02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:07.000
But, you know, as a super multitasking fan, I was very excited to see, ooh, they're still making, Aaron's in there making updates again.

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:08.000
That's awesome.

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:15.000
Yeah, I mean, honestly, most of it is just to fix something that was, ugh, the whole thing was frustrating.

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:24.000
Long story very short, a third-party library that I used for the Steam support, leaderboards, stats, and so on, it broke.

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:31.000
And they basically didn't provide any support, so I had to redo the Steam support from scratch using a totally different library.

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:34.000
Yikes. Well, you got it, though. Congrats.

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:40.000
My one request, though, before you put out bungee ferret tossing on Steam, which you may or may not be confirming right now.

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:43.000
Please let me submit a picture of Mr. Smoosh for inclusion.

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:46.000
Oh, yes, the call will go out for more pet pictures.

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:50.000
Okay, amazing. All right. All right, my friend, I'm gonna let you go. Best of luck.

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:51.000
Have a great week, guys.

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:52.000
You, too. Bye.

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:53.000
Thank you.

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:56.000
All right, that is gonna do it for the Skypline tonight. Thanks so much to all the callers.

02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:00.000
But if you didn't get through for whatever reason, it's, we're after nine o'clock, I gotta wrap up.

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:04.000
But if you didn't get through for whatever reason, please feel free to send us a tweet at OLR.

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:08.000
You can always email us, of course. Participate at orangelaunchradio.com.

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:14.000
Sj100matt pointing out tonight's calls were off in the state of New York. All four callers were from New York tonight. That's very true.

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:22.000
Do you know, that goes back to the live 365 days when you could see, like, what markets, like, number one was always Sacramento, obviously,

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:25.000
because that's where the show is based and where all our friends are that we were telling about the show.

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:30.000
But the number two market for this show is, like, almost always been New York, which I find.

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:36.000
I always just kind of was like, well, it's, you know, New York City is a big city, of course, but no, you guys are awesome.

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:42.000
All of you are awesome, though, no matter where you live, where you're from. International listenership is amazing as well.

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:46.000
Met so many, so many people around the world. All right, anyway, we gotta wrap up for the night.

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:50.000
Thank you guys so much. I did not even check if there's any last minute stories, but at this point.

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:54.000
I was just gonna mention one thing I saw here. Quake Champions went free to play.

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000
Oh, yeah, I did hear about that. That was other news.

02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:01.000
So they have an option where they're gonna rotate out a certain champion that'll be free,

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:08.000
and then you can unlock more by earning the favor in matches, or I think you can also pay to unlock stuff too.

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:14.000
Nice. All right. Well, we're gonna wrap it up here at Orange Launch Radio, but if you enjoyed what you heard here at the show tonight,

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:19.000
please tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:23.000
but if the voices aren't here to air, then what are we gonna say? Nothing.

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:27.000
So anyway, please help us spread the word. A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes,

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:31.000
or wherever it is that you heard about this program. Those reviews go a very long way,

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:35.000
and I really do appreciate them, so thank you, thank you to those that are leaving them.

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:40.000
That does it. Let's go around and get folks' final thought for the night. Loki!

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:47.000
My final thought is, sometimes the sound of goodbye is louder than any drum beat.

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:51.000
Okay, throwing it back, seventh style. I see you. I see you.

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:57.000
Then let's see, my final thought would be, um...

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:07.000
I guess then my final thought would be, die, Suke.

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:11.000
And until then, until next week, we'll see you in seven days, when once again we can...

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:15.000
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:18.000
