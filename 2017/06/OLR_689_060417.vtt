Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:22.000
This week, both Nintendo and Steam announce service changes to accommodate the changing environment that games and we gamers find ourselves in, both companies doing something that few others of their size have.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
They're not the only ones in the news this week, this and more starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:49.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 689 of our show for this June the 4th of 2017, moving into our official month of the 15 year anniversary of this program.

00:50.000 --> 00:59.000
My name is Rob Roberts, here with you every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black will show at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOGnetwork.com

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
and by my side, as she has been for the last 15 years, I've watched her grown up from a grown up to a growner up.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
It's DarkSakura and Jamie Summers.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
You're such a dork. Oh my god.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
I didn't know how else to phrase that, but if you think about it, like 15 years, that's a very long time.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Some of y'all have grown up in that time.

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
I know, we always, well not always, but once in a while we'll get those emails from somebody that's like, I listened to you when I was 12.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
I listened to you in the 8th grade and first I'm thinking, first off, you shouldn't be listening to this show in the 8th grade.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
And then, oh now I'm married and have children and I'm like, oh yeah, that makes me feel like a young butt.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
I'm married and still don't have children. And guess what? I'm not going to.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
Hey, and guess what? I'm finally married because I'm able to. So there you go, yay.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
How about that?

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
By the way, all of our listeners, happy Pride Month.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Yes, happy Pride Month. Also say hello over there to Techmaster Loki.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
It's not always what it's cracked up to be too, the whole marriage thing.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Or the kids too.

02:04.000 --> 02:11.000
Well, see, Alan and I don't really plan to introduce kids into the equation, besides pets. We'll be parents to cats.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Our babies are the best babies.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
Exactly. But I don't know, from my perspective, married life really hasn't been that different from what it was before.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
But Alan and I were together for seven years. But actually that's one thing everybody in here has in common.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Everybody was with their partner for a very long time before getting married in here.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
Dan and I were together for seven years. We went to the courthouse.

02:33.000 --> 02:40.000
Which is what Alan and I did. But you and Nellie were dating when OLR first started, right, Loki?

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Yeah, so like five years.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
Yeah, but that's still a long time. Most people I know kind of jump into it a year or two years.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
I know, like my sister, who then got divorced a year later.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I believe in a long QA period.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Everybody's got to do what works for them. I'm not one to judge what other people want to do.

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
But some people get married after six months and then they're still together. So it works, whatever works for you.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
I am. And also, thanks for the reminder of the whole Pride Month thing. I was well aware of it yesterday. I went to Sacramento.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Oh, did you go downtown?

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
We didn't go downtown. We were far away from the whole Pride thing. We went to go for my wife's birthday.

03:19.000 --> 03:27.000
But for some reason, Pride's leaking out everywhere. So there was a guy who I assumed was dressed up like Captain Underpants.

03:27.000 --> 03:35.000
He had a cape and underwear and was yelling at a train. So it was either a homeless man or it was the real life Captain Underpants.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
There was also, there was Sacramento Pride was yesterday. I didn't go. I went like two years ago.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
That was at work.

03:43.000 --> 03:51.000
Yeah. I mean, it's just, well, A, I didn't want to go by myself. Alan had to work. And B, I'm going to be real.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
It's kind of just like food trucks and vendors you see at every other fair and stuff.

03:56.000 --> 04:06.000
I like food trucks. If this is what homosexuality is bringing to the table, by God, let's spread it everywhere.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Thank you. Thank you, Loki, for your true allyship. We support you.

04:13.000 --> 04:24.000
Anyway, go to our chat over at live.vagadetwork.com. Let's see. Bobby is pointing out that he's getting married next March and no kids.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
It's right. Him and Jennifer. He's and Jennifer and I have only been together three years. That's still, that's still quite a while.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
So there's still a reasonable QA period.

04:31.000 --> 04:38.000
Yes. It is a good incubation character. And it's also important. I approve of Jennifer, which is also a very important part of this whole equation.

04:38.000 --> 04:45.000
Right. That, that I should be able to approve whoever Bobby's going to marry. Right. But I definitely approve of Jennifer. I think she's great.

04:45.000 --> 04:53.000
So anyway, let's, let's get off the marriage topic and let's talk a little bit about it because it is a video game show. I want to talk about video games.

04:53.000 --> 05:02.000
Our pal YYR is going to join us tonight. He was going to be here in studio. Wasn't able to make it here live. Plans changed.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
So we're going to have him still to just check in and see what's going on with his stuff.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
We're going to check in with him a little later in the show, probably towards the beginning of part B. If you don't know why YYR.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
I mean, he, he, he emails the show pretty frequently and, and, and calls in here and there too.

05:16.000 --> 05:24.000
But very important to note, he has also fully realized a couple of orange lounge radio dream games.

05:24.000 --> 05:32.000
So, and I'm not sure. Can you still buy this on 360 or did they finally shut that down? The XNA games?

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
Did they finally close that close that down? Well, I don't, I don't know if it's still there and I'll have to ask him,

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
but bungee ferret tossing on the Xbox 360 was, was an idea that started here on the show.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
Not one of the backwards compatible games that, you know, they keep putting forth.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
It'd be nice to see some backwards. Billy support for bungee ferret toss.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
It would be, it would be nice to ask Microsoft about that or something, but yeah.

05:55.000 --> 06:02.000
So there's, there's that. And then on the PlayStation Vita for a very short time before they shut that down,

06:02.000 --> 06:09.000
you were able to get a game called Pixel Poops, which he had to rename from Pixel Shits was what,

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
and yes, these things actually happened on our show where we were throwing around ideas out there and, and this happened.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
And YYR is correcting us. You can still buy those on the Xbox indie games.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Until September.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Yep.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
Not, not, I know the Vita one's long because that was only like he said when he put it out.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
That's PlayStation Mobile, yeah.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Yeah, he was like, you only have like six weeks to buy it and then it's, it's gone.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
So, uh, okay. So it's, so the, the window is closing.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
So YYRs in chat if you want to say hi to him early, but we'll be, uh, we'll be talking to him a little later in the program.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
Uh, meanwhile, we're on the Eve, essentially our next show.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
The Eve three.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
The Eve three. That's right.

06:46.000 --> 06:54.000
We're spot in the middle of, uh, the, the E3 celebration next week because, uh, Bethesda's press conference is happening literally during the show next week.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
We're going to have to do that whole thing where we kind of stop, do the press conference, then start again.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Um, and we'll do that next week.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
But, uh, you know, this week or this E3, things are happening very early.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
You know, we have EA is going on Saturday this year.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
We're going all the way back to Saturday, right?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Yeah, I guess.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
EA is Saturday and then Microsoft is Sunday morning.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
That's a lot earlier than we're used to E3 week.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
So that's going on as well.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
So we'll, we'll kind of know, you know, some of the big E3 stuff by the next episode.

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
Granted, we'll still have to wait for Nintendo's presentation and Sony's presentation.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
And I'm sure the PC gaming expo will have plenty to get excited about.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
So I'm not as old in the watching that for me three times.

07:39.000 --> 07:50.000
But anyway, I thought this would be a good time to talk about either our E3 predictions or our E3, what you'd like to see.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
And I'm opening this up to our chatters as well.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
Of course, again, live.vognetwork.com because we always tape live on Sunday nights.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
What is it that you'd like to see at E3 or what is your prediction?

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Let us know which you're kind of talking about here.

08:05.000 --> 08:12.000
So this is, this is a thing I'm sure a lot of your podcast pals are going to be talking about this week is what are the big old predictions?

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
So Loki, I'm sure you've got things to say.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
I mean, I'm going to be as vague as possible.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Is this a prediction or is this what you want to see?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
I would like to see.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Okay.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
I would just like to be excited by something or surprised by something.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
Because that's really the big thing is like getting in the big shock, like, Oh my God, I wasn't expecting that.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
That's amazing.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
I would like that kind of moment in something, please.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
That would be...

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Are we talking about like, are we talking about like Sony two years ago?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I'm talking about like, yeah, anything.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
I mean, just like Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Shenmue 3, Last Guardian, like...

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Just like some really exciting stuff.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
I mean, I don't know what it really would be at this point.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
Like, like I was even going back today at some of this stuff.

08:53.000 --> 09:00.000
Like for example, Kotaku does this thing where they kind of before E3 each year say, okay, what did they show last year?

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
What of those promises that they made, what did they actually follow through with?

09:04.000 --> 09:10.000
And it's like most of the stuff that they showed at Sony's thing, it's like, this shit was sewn like last year, the year before last.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
And it's not out yet.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
Sony, yeah, Sony has a history of very long trajectories with the things they announced.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
They're announcing things that are way out.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
I mean, they finally delivered on Last Guardian and...

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
Well, Last Guardian and also, what was the last one that came out?

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Fuck, I can't remember the name now.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Horizon Zero Dawn.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
I mean, that was pretty good.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
And it makes me excited about the other stuff that they have.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
It's just, I don't really know what to expect.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
Even like Microsoft right now, like fuck, I don't know what the hell they have in the pipeline.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Crackdown.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Crackdown, yeah, I'm expecting that.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
But like, aside from that, and maybe probably another Forza game.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
I mean, I don't know if they're Halo something.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I mean, I really don't know what they have coming.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
Which I guess is a good thing because I'm not really expecting anything, so...

09:57.000 --> 10:04.000
Yeah, I think Microsoft has the potential to do what you want and give you the unexpected this year.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Because we really, I mean, they are such a wild card.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Like, we don't know what fucking direction they're going to Scorpio.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Scorpio could, I mean, I say Scorpio could be anything.

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
Yes, we have some ideas what Scorpio is, but I mean, it's really wide open for Microsoft right now.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
Honestly, like Nintendo, I have no expectations for Nintendo, and I'm sure they're going to meet those just fine.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
So, I don't know.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
I mean, and then the other few publishers out there.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
Honestly, I would like a new Ridge Racer.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Let's just announce a new Ridge Racer.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
That's what, that's my hopeful thing I'd like to see.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
Because honestly, yeah, I know they did some really shit releases of Ridge Racer and that kind of franchise.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
But come on, you can bring it back and just like do a really kick-ass racing year.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
And I don't understand why they can't do that.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
They're not incapable of doing that.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
So, that's what I'd like to see.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
Because we've had several console launches with no Ridge Racer, and that's a crime.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Okay.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
StarSocker, I'm going to go to you.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Predictions or what you'd like to see?

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
My prediction is that all of the companies except for Nintendo are not going to release anything original.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
Except for Nintendo, who always tries to release something original every couple of, you know,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I'd say at least a couple of things a year.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
But it's all going to be more of the same shit.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Okay, hold up, hold up.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
Because as much as I want to be a Nintendo as well, I have to call this out.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
Because Nintendo's got a very good chance they're going to do Wii U rehashes.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
That's not totally original.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
We've got ARMS coming, but we already knew about that.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
That's those Wii Sports boxings, I mean, you know.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
I'll talk about ARMS later, but anyway.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
But at any rate, it seems the only one really releasing much in the way of original games has been Nintendo.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
It seems the only one really releasing much in the way of original games has been Nintendo.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
You know, we have a couple of new IPs, but they're really more of the same genre.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
What I'd like to see is something completely different.

11:52.000 --> 11:59.000
I'd like to see a lot more indie developers get their items released on the big consoles.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
And actually have the support that was promised instead of just lip service.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
That's really it.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Okay.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
For me, let's do predictions.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
So, I'm going to start, I'll start with Nintendo there a little bit.

12:11.000 --> 12:17.000
So, Nintendo, I do expect that more Wii U ports are inevitable.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
I was seeing some of the stuff on other sites, and one of them had like a list of eight games.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Didn't they have like another Pikmin game coming?

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
They've all but confirmed a Pikmin 4 is in the works.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
It's like, I get it that you like Pikmin, but dude.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
I mean, honestly, on the scale of all the franchises Nintendo has, Pikmin is like...

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Wait on there.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
For you.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
For me, yes.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
What about Metroid?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Come on.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
You can't say Metroid is a less popular franchise than Pikmin.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
So, okay.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
So, here's the thing with the Wii U ports.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Yes, they're going to happen, but there's going to be a limited number.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
And there's a lot of what if factors.

12:52.000 --> 12:58.000
I think the one that's guaranteed, for me the biggest, like if I were betting money

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
on this whole thing, the one I would say this will happen is Smash Brothers.

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
That's the one that I think is going to happen before any, assuredly compared to any of the others.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
I might end up being wrong, but I think that's the one.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Mario Maker.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
Mario Maker is probably number two on that list of what would most likely come over from

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
the Wii U.

13:17.000 --> 13:24.000
I would say Bayonetta 2, and that's part wishful thinking, but also if there is a Bayonetta

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
3 in the pipeline, as there's been a lot of smoke and fire towards that that could actually

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
be a thing, and I think we got even a story later on in the show that kind of addresses

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
that, so I'll save that for then.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
But if Bayonetta 3, if there is any truth to that, and that is a big reveal for somebody,

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
then I think Bayonetta 2 makes a lot of sense to try again on the Switch.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
So those are kind of like my top three for what games, but I saw a site somewhere that

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
was like Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze could be, no, that's not going to be one.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Please no.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
That's, no, not that one.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
I mean, it's not a bad game, but it's just kind of, you know, we're moving on past that.

13:58.000 --> 14:07.000
But although speaking of retro, I think, my heart says it's going to be a new Metroid

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
game, but I just, I feel like I'm leading myself into disaster with that whole thing.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
It could be an original IP.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
As long as it's not an Other M. Which Other M honestly looked good.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Yeah, but Team Ninja got involved with that.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
That was a little different.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
So I don't think it's going to be Other M. I think it would be Metroid Prime.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Again, if anything else, going to be in that type of vein.

14:27.000 --> 14:33.000
If it's either that or it's a completely original IP because Nintendo has had success

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
with the original IP thing right now between Splatoon.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I'm sure ARMS is going to do very well for them.

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
You know, Nintendo is kind of, yes, you can say, LOL, they do Mario and Zelda all the

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
time, but they are starting to put their feelers out more towards doing new shit.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
So maybe they're, maybe retro is going to be able to do something like that.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
Then the other thing that I'm kind of like on the fence on is Virtual Console.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
And some of the things that have happened this past week that we'll get into later

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
have made me think maybe Virtual Console is not so guaranteed right now.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
But I just, I feel like this is it.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
This is the year.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
One of two things is going to happen.

15:09.000 --> 15:15.000
Mother 3 is either going to finally happen or that second Densetsu collection is getting

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
translated, including part three.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
It better.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
And so, and maybe that's part my heart right there too.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
But I really think I feel good that this might be the year that one of those like super

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
in demand, you know, games of the Super Nintendo.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
I know Mother 3 was a Super Nintendo, but you know, kind of same graphic style comes

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
comes out finally.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
So those are those are kind of where I'm at with Nintendo.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
But otherwise, I expect the large part of the focus to be on Super Mario Odyssey, because

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
that's what they want to sell systems through the holiday.

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
But there there will be one other big AA AAA title this holiday.

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
But it could be it could be the Smash remaster could be the other thing.

15:54.000 --> 16:00.000
But I just don't see there's not going to be more than two because Nintendo wants to

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
drag that out for they're not going to do eight fucking Wii U remasters in a year.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
That's not happening.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
They're going to drag it out to fill up 2018 and on and on and on and so forth.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
So that would be that would be my thought.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Oh, and we do know Rabbids cross Mario that's happening.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
So that's something we know is happening.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
But that's that's also a third party game.

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
So this also can show that yes, which does have third party support and Mario.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
They'll have a little more with that.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Let's talk about Sony for a little bit.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
So the interesting thing about Sony is that, yeah, with Sony having announced all this

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
other stuff that they haven't really released yet.

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
I do kind of expect a lot of updates from Sony on projects that we've heard about,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
but haven't really seen what's coming.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I expect we'll see more Death Stranding.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
We'll see another trailer for that.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
We'll see another update from The Last of Us 2.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
God of War.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
God of War.

16:56.000 --> 17:02.000
The other was at the other that other zombie game.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
I don't remember what it was now.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
That other game that they showed.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
They showed it twice during the conference.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
Remember that they showed it once early on and then they showed it at the end.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
And we were all kind of thinking this is where Red Dead Redemption 2 was supposed to be.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
So I think that is going to show up instead.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Yeah, I guess Red Dead Redemption will be in one of them, I'm sure.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
They'll show a trailer for it.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
It's still not coming out for a long time.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
It's not, but they want to get the hype with the graphics and everything.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
So that's definitely showing up at Sony or Microsoft for sure.

17:29.000 --> 17:35.000
Whoever gets that DLC exclusive or whatever bullshit that they'll try to fucking pull back.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
I think there's a very good chance the Mystery Marvel project is going to have some more

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
information come out at E3.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
The one that Square Enix is working on.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
I think there's definitely the potential for that.

17:48.000 --> 17:55.000
I think if it's true that the Final Fantasy 7 remaster has been delayed, I think you won't see it.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
I think Final Fantasy 7 remaster is going to take the year off if that is still...

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
I'm kind of fine with that.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Yeah, me too.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
I think you could get a major Kingdom Hearts 3 trailer.

18:06.000 --> 18:12.000
They may have the balls to go Kingdom Hearts 3 and then Winter 2019.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
They might. I don't know. That's a stretch.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
We will talk about this again soon or we will have an announcement later.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
That's a big stretch.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
SSG100Matt says, I hope we find out what the game is in Death Stranding.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
I think there's a very good chance it will be a gameplay thing.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
We'll see though. We'll see.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
No.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Yeah, let's see.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
TigerClawnChat says, what if this Marvel game from Square Enix is some sort of JRPG style game?

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Except it's not being developed in Japan. It's being developed here.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
It's Crystal Dynamics is doing it, right?

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
Who did Tomb Raider. They're doing it, right?

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
Black Widow is a very, very bad day.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
Yes, exactly. Black Widow is a very, very bad day.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
You know she has a bad day. Everyone else is going to have a bad day.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
Yeah, we'll see what happens with that.

18:57.000 --> 19:02.000
Then there's Microsoft and I really don't know what direction to go with Microsoft.

19:02.000 --> 19:09.000
There's such a wild card and obviously Scorpio and why I need one is very important.

19:09.000 --> 19:15.000
Of course, there's going to be some game announcements and I do expect that Crackdown is finally going to be out this holiday.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
If it's not, I don't know what else they've got right now.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
I can't wait for that. I hope it comes out. I hope it's good.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
I'm glad that they're taking the time to polish that up.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
I'm still curious. Remember when that system first came out?

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
It was all about cloud, cloud, cloud, cloud, cloud processing, cloud, cloud this.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
This is going to make this possible and so I'm curious to see if that's still the case with all this crap.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Well, I wouldn't put it past Microsoft though.

19:38.000 --> 19:46.000
See, Microsoft on this stage has the ability to talk about more than just the Project Scorpio and the Xbox One.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
They can talk a little bit about Windows 10.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
We know they're really trying to shift things around with this Mixer thing.

19:53.000 --> 20:00.000
Beam has now changed into Mixer and they're going to broadcast their event on Mixer to try to get more eyes over there.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Although, I thought I heard it's going to be on Twitch as well anyway.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
I think it's on YouTube also.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
Yeah, so I kind of think Microsoft also kind of knows they need to be everywhere.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
I think the 4K, if you want that, is over on...

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Come on, let's be honest.

20:12.000 --> 20:18.000
Forcing someone to use your platform to watch your event is not going to really sell you on that platform.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I don't know.

20:20.000 --> 20:32.000
I don't know. Anyway, but I'm just not sure what games they're going to come out with, which could be a really good thing.

20:32.000 --> 20:41.000
Like I said before, if any company has the potential to kind of surprise us with we're going to pull this one out of the vault or we got the game back together,

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
maybe this is the Battletoads year after all this fucking time.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Maybe this is the year Battletoads is coming.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
That would be surprising. I'd be down with that.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
That would be a pleasant surprise, I think, for a lot of people.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
That would be pretty cool.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
So, sure, why not? I'm going to say Battletoads, finally, this year.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
Because we just don't know what fuck all else Microsoft is going to pull out, but that could be a great surprise.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Are they going to do another Gears of War thing or something?

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
Ooh! I know what they could do. I know what stunt they could pull.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
You ready?

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Minecraft 2.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Well...

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
Look, I know everybody's sighing, but you sigh, but it's an inevitability.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
There will be a Minecraft 2.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Yes, there will be at some point.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
So, why not?

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
I'm just saying, wait and see.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
The silence is deafening with that whole thing.

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
I just like, it's going to be so hard for them to do that. I mean, I don't know.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
I know, I know, but they got to keep that going somehow.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
I mean, Minecraft doesn't really need a lot of help and they still have the Switch and all that stuff,

21:44.000 --> 21:50.000
but I think if they kind of drop hints or maybe a first little peek at what Minecraft 2 might be,

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
I think there's a serious chance.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
Someday, there will be a Minecraft 2.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
Microsoft did not buy that franchise to do nothing with it.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Oh, they're making tons of money off of it.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
Of course they're still making money, but how much do they spend, Loki?

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Two billion? Was that how much they spent on it?

22:06.000 --> 22:12.000
Okay, they're going to do more than just this Minecraft game that they're already porting everywhere.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
There's going to be another Minecraft game.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
That's why they're all $30. I mean, they're making two million back.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
There is that too.

22:18.000 --> 22:25.000
YYR points out, it would be tough for a Minecraft 2 to succeed. After all, it has Minecraft 1 as competition.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
Tigerclass says if Minecraft 2 happens, it'll be an Xbox One and Windows 10 exclusive.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
No, it won't.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
At first, it'll be a timed exclusive.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
That might kill it right there though, because people, I mean...

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Not the Windows 10 owner.

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
You're going to have to show why this is so amazing.

22:44.000 --> 22:50.000
Yeah, you are competing against your first game, so what's going to really set this apart?

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
That's going to be a hard thing to sell.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
Sure, they're going to try it, but I don't know.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I think it's too soon.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
Alright, well, believe it or not, in seven days, we're going to have some of these answers.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
So we'll see. We'll see what happens.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
So yeah, E3 kicks off on Saturday with EA's press event.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
What do we think Bethesda's going to do?

23:14.000 --> 23:23.000
Again, a lot of updates. I think Fallout Side Story, like a Fallout Vegas 2 or something is what it's going to be.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
It's not going to be Elder Scrolls.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
Or you think Fallout 4 VR?

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
No.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Or is that too early?

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
No, it's not that it's too early. I just kind of feel like Fallout 4 has lived its life.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
Better yet, here's what I want to actually go back to Sony real quick. Here's what I'd like to see more of.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
PlayStation VR stuff.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Sure, sure. Me too.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
Now I'm seeing... I was randomly at Target the other day and there was a ton of PlayStation VRs available.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
So I was like, okay, well now they're available to buy again, so I just need to be convinced why I need one.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
And then maybe I'll pick one up.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I'm not convinced and I don't think I will be.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Well yeah, but you have the whole...

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
It's probably a good idea if you're not really into it. I mean, I even mind that I don't use it a whole ton.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
And you have the whole motion thing to consider too that, you know, is an issue.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
On top of that, I've never liked VR anyway, so...

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
Well maybe it's just you're missing that thing that makes you want it.

24:11.000 --> 24:18.000
It's like any peripheral. The Wii would have never sold what it sold if it wasn't for Wii Sports.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
It takes that game.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
Do roller coasters and stuff make you sick or is it just like first person games?

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
I'm okay on a roller coaster in the front seat.

24:26.000 --> 24:32.000
So I think these would be fine because especially with the VR being such a high refresh rate, you're not going to have...

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Also glasses.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
The glasses can fit in it just fine.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Oh yeah, they have to consider that.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
It works with the glasses.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Yeah, it works with glasses.

24:39.000 --> 24:46.000
So I mean, I think with it being such a high refresh rate and being that it's synced to your movement and everything, it might be not as bad as you think.

24:46.000 --> 24:53.000
Or it depends on the game really because some people, they can develop games that won't make you feel very sick at all.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
Some, they just suck at it and you'll probably get queasy.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
Well how did you do with the Virtual Boy?

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
Because the technology has become 20 years since the Virtual Boy.

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
The Virtual Boy made me nauseous and gave me migraines.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
I mean seriously, full on ice pick headaches.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
Can you imagine that though? Like the Virtual Boy 20 years ago.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
I mean look at what that looks like now.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
That 20 year leap.

25:16.000 --> 25:22.000
Imagine what's going to make, what kind of technology out there is going to make what we have now look as shitty as that.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
I mean can you imagine that?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Holodeck. Holodeck. It's coming.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
That is just ridiculous to think about.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
That's the year this show ends is when the Holodeck finally comes out.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
It's like, welp, we made it. There's nothing else to say.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
We always say gaming's getting one step closer to the Holodeck.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
Holodeck's out. I guess that's it. We're done.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Well that's been a good run.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
It's been a good run.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
We're playing really whatever we want to play.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
Could you imagine the video cast you could do on a Holodeck though?

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Oh sure.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
It doesn't matter no one would be watching it because they'd be in their Holodecks.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
I mean, everybody would be in their sex-a-deck.

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
Anyway, YYR is asking, a few people in here have PSVR right? Did you guys try Polybius?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
I haven't.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
I don't have PSVR sadly.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
I don't need to be mind controlled for the government.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
I think this has come a long way from the legend.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
It looked kind of shitty, so no thanks.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
Alright, so there you go. Some predictions.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
We'll find out what's really happening in a week's time. At least half of it.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
We'll finally have the Microsoft questions answered.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
We'll get the Bethesda questions answered in the show.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
But we'll still have to wait a little longer for Sony and Nintendo.

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
Bobby, you are confused. The Virtual Boy was VR. It was very red.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
That's true. Virtual Boy didn't move with you or any of that stuff.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
It actually sat on a platform.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
I think that's part of what contributed to all the headaches too.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
Didn't the commercials have it walking on those legs?

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Probably.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Sorry, my mouth was full of almonds.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
It's been years. I don't remember the commercials very well.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
I'm going to look for the commercial right now.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Alright, you do that.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
Anyhow, let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Obviously not the Virtual Boy.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
So we'll start with Dark Sakura. How was your gaming week?

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
Actually, I did touch our Virtual Boy.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
I moved the case that it's in.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
I'm sorry, I still have almonds in my mouth.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
I played well.

27:25.000 --> 27:30.000
I played my usual stuff on my phone.

27:30.000 --> 27:37.000
I'm not really playing a lot of stuff right now, but my schedule, thankfully, yes, is changing again.

27:38.000 --> 27:43.000
I'm hoping that now that I have her story, I want to sit and play it.

27:43.000 --> 27:49.000
Thank you to Raginator for the gift, even though I went and bought the bundle right after.

27:49.000 --> 27:57.000
My goal is that by the end of the month, I will have finished Danganronpa 2.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
I just need to sit down and do it.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
Maybe if I stream it, y'all will watch.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
Who knows? You'll watch me fail.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
Sometimes you just have to kind of put it out there and see who shows up.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
I have to put it out.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
You know what I mean.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Whatever.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
All right.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
That's really it.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Moving on to Loki.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
I played a little bit of Overwatch.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Very little.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
It's still against AI because I'm still learning characters.

28:22.000 --> 28:27.000
So I started playing a little bit of Roadhog, which I'm having a good time with.

28:27.000 --> 28:34.000
I'm still trying to figure out which character is going to be the best fit for me and not quite there yet.

28:34.000 --> 28:41.000
That's why I know a lot of people are like, don't worry about not playing against AI or whatever.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Just playing against real people.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
It's like if you're not playing competitive, no one gives a shit anyways.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
They all suck.

28:47.000 --> 28:53.000
I still don't want to be a detriment to my team because I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing in there.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
I can shoot people in the face and that's about it.

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
So I've been trying to find characters that are good at that.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
But yeah.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
It doesn't matter.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
Medium difficulty was still pretty good against the AI.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
So I don't know.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
I'm just kind of messing around with it right now.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
And then I played a little bit more of the Totally Epic Battle Simulator.

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
And that's just kind of a fun time waste when you just don't really want to do anything.

29:18.000 --> 29:25.000
I did notice though they just updated to 1.0, which means it's finally released and not in early access anymore.

29:25.000 --> 29:31.000
Although I think it should really still be in early access because their pathfinding AI is just shit.

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
I had an army of thousands of people and there was a bridge.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
And they just jumped into the water and killed themselves.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
All like lemmings.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Same with the other team too.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
None of them figured out that there was a bridge there.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
It's just, we're just going to dive into the water and die.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
I'm like, this is not exciting at all.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Not epic.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
One bit.

29:54.000 --> 29:59.000
And then aside from that, I've been playing still more of the stupid Office Space Idol Clicker game.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Because they do keep mixing it up.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
I mean, literally updates almost every week.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
And they're giving different type of gameplay in there.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
And they're making it now.

30:08.000 --> 30:14.000
They have the, well, supposed to be this daily stuff that you do to unlock more of the in-game currency.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
It's really easy shit.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
The problem is their timer right now is broken.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
So it resets every 24 hours.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
The timer that is.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Not any of the events.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
So it just keeps going and going and going.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
But once that's fixed though, it is pretty nice.

30:29.000 --> 30:35.000
Because there's really, they're making it super easy to get all the in-game currency without having to spend real money for it.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Which, I'm not going to do that anyways.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
But with that and all the freebies and the different events that they have going on.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
It's a very nice time sink in it.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
There's a little bit of strategy to playing it as well.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
So it's a little bit better than some of the other Clicker games.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
I don't know.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
I'm just having fun with it.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
So, whatever.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
And then Pokemon Go.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Just because, you know, dailies.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
I hit level 31 this week.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Cool.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Yay.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Alright, that it?

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
That's it.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
Alright, my game of the week.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
We won't go.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
A lot of the same stuff I've been playing.

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
I'm still back and I was leveling my White Mage to level 60.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
That way I can have all my healers at maximum level.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
Because I have White Mage Scholar and Astrologian.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
All at level 60 because the expansion is less than two weeks away for the early access.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
So that's exciting.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
So just kind of getting prepared for that.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Because I do love Misa 5 SE 14.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
So if you all think I stream that a lot now.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Wait until Stormblood launches.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
Because it's going to be taken over for a little while there.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
At least until I get through the main story in Stormblood.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
Because I probably won't end up doing any of the end game raiding or any of that stuff.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
I don't usually get into that.

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
So once I kind of burn through the story I'll be able to go back to all the other games I enjoy as well.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Including Overwatch.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
I was playing a little bit of that as well.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Let's talk about...

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Oh, Mario Kart 8.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
I'm still playing.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
And I plan to play that tonight after OLR as well.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Because I've been promising a multiplayer stream of that for a while.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
So I'm going to play that tonight.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
But I do want to talk about on the Switch.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
I also finally got around to playing ARMS.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Because I wasn't able to do the demo last week.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Because I just wasn't around or whatever.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
But I was able to sit down during one of the times this week.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
And I did finally play ARMS.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
And I've got to admit, I didn't care for it.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
I did not care for it.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
And for me what it boiled down to was just kind of like how it controlled.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Like it just felt like I was playing a fighting game underwater.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
Like it was just like the sluggishness of the...

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
And I feared this was kind of going to be what it was based off the trailers.

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
But like the sluggishness of the way the hands kind of move through the air and all this stuff.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
And I just...

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
I don't know.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
There were things I liked about it.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
I liked how the lobby rooms were set up.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
How you would kind of see like you're in a room with seven other people.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
And all these people were going to play against each other.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
And then the people that lost are going to play against each other.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
And then there's going to be a team event that happens here.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
Like I kind of liked how that was being executed.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
But it just didn't really care for the game itself.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Like it just wasn't that interesting to me.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Like it just...

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
You know.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
If I was a little kid I probably would have loved it.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
And honestly this game stands to do very well with younger people.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
Because I think it's kind of a fighting game that's not violent.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
You know at all.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
That kids can really get into.

33:09.000 --> 33:14.000
And I think the pace of the game will lend itself very well for younger folks.

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
So I'm not... I mean the game probably will do alright.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
It's just not for me.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
And that's okay.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Not every game is for me.

33:22.000 --> 33:27.000
The most interesting part about the Switch and how Nintendo is handling it.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
You look at the demographics that are buying the Switch.

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
The vast majority are adults.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
Not kids buying the Switch.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
Well Loki, kids don't exactly have $400 to drive.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
I understand.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
But they're not the ones that own the Switch.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Yes I get it.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
They're not dropping $400 for the Switch.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
But they're not the ones that the Switch is being bought for.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
I mean the primary user of the Switch is an adult.

33:52.000 --> 33:56.000
Yet all the content on it seems like it's catering towards kids.

33:56.000 --> 34:01.000
I think you seriously need to cater towards the people that are buying the console.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Like don't get me wrong.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
It's not a bad thing to have content for kids on there.

34:05.000 --> 34:11.000
But if your content is focused at this demographic that's just not really picking up the system.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
That's kind of a problem.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
Okay so Chad is yelling that my mic went out while I was talking about ARMS.

34:17.000 --> 34:22.000
So for the sake of the podcasters who would have heard a very awkward skip there.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Because I'm going to cut the silence out.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
Let me try to restate what I was saying a little bit about ARMS.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
So I liked the lobby system and all that.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
But I did not care for just how sluggish the game felt for me.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
And I think it's going to be very good for kids.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
Like if they're 7 years old or whatever.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
And I think it's going to be a great fighting game for kids.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
But I just don't think it was a great fighting game for me.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Like for me it was just.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
I don't know.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
I didn't really care for the way it controlled.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
And I just didn't.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
I didn't like the concept.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
I don't know how else to put it.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Like some things just don't work.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
And that's.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
It didn't work for me.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Like you know the whole like.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
Oh I'm going to punch and then kind of wave my arm in the air to go where it needs to go.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
And it was just weird.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
So I just didn't like.

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
I don't know why Nintendo wants it to be an e-sport thing so bad.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
I just.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
You know unless it's for like a junior division or something.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
I just don't see a lot of professional players really picking this game up.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
So.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
I don't know.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Yeah.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
ActDeft in chat says I thought the controls were fine but they are kind of awkward.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
YYR in chat says don't forget we're all kids.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
In a way but I just.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
It's different.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
I would just rather play Street Fighter 4.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
Like here.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
I've got the actual.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
This is statistics straight from Nintendo.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
Usage by household.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
U.S. OK so this is usage.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Two percent.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Twelve and under.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
Five percent.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Thirteen to fifteen.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Seven percent.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Sixteen to eighteen.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Everything else.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Is an adult.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Beyond that.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
And that's.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
I mean.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
I get it.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
That they're.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
But.

35:57.000 --> 36:04.000
There's Nintendo proxy that I know that people like that but I think that the problem is they're not targeting that demographic and I think that is why.

36:05.000 --> 36:15.000
The Wii U kind of faltered a bit because a lot of that market wasn't being met like it wasn't like for me I mean originally was like there's not really anything driving me to that system there's not a game that.

36:16.000 --> 36:24.000
I really really really really really want to play on it because they're focusing on a totally a demographic that's not even really touching the system.

36:24.000 --> 36:29.000
I mean that's a good way to try to bring in more of that demographic but it doesn't seem to be working.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Interesting.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
So anyway that was my time with arms.

36:33.000 --> 36:40.000
So I'm happy Nintendo put it out there so I didn't have to drop the money on the game to figure out that I didn't like it.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
But I'll just wait on Splatoon 2.

36:42.000 --> 36:47.000
I know I'm going to dig that so I'll pick up Splatoon 2 when it's out but I'm going to pass on arms.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
Maybe if Nintendo puts it on sale later on.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
Haha.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
But maybe in the holidays if it drops down to 20 bucks.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Maybe.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
I don't know.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
It depends.

36:56.000 --> 37:03.000
I'm not into what my friends are and what kind of lasting power it has in that regard but yeah just not just not feeling it personally.

37:03.000 --> 37:09.000
It's not it's not going to have the lasting power of like say a one two switch but I'm sure it'll do okay.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
I feel like I got an email this week that was practically like pretty please buy one two switch type of thing I'm like.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
No.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
I'm not going to do that.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
I'm sorry.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
I was not that bored.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
It was a misfire.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
Tiger in chat says do you think arms can be an e-sports sensation.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
No.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
It's too fucking slow.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
Maybe with a junior division with kids.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
I think it would be a great thing for kids.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
But that's that's about as far as I see it going.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Why.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
I would rather them play Smash Brothers.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
I mean why.

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
Kids are already playing Smash Brothers and playing it competitively.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Why do we need to fucking put out like.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
Fucking hand holding bullshit the game you know fighting it like.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Fighting game for babies the game.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
I don't think arms hands holds you it's just.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
It's it's a slower game.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
At least that was my feeling playing it.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Slower paced game.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
That's all.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
I just really it felt like they're trying to shoehorn.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
They're trying to shoehorn a lot of their games in the bean e-sports.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
You can't just fucking.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
That doesn't happen.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
You can't just force the game to be e-sports.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
It has to be popular.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
People have to want to play competitively.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
You can't just make.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
And then it will blow up into like you know a whole e-sport thing.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
You can't just say this is e-sports.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
You will accept it as e-sports.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
No it's not.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Unless you're Blizzard then you can't do that.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
But you can't make fetch happen.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
Exactly.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Exactly.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
All right.

38:36.000 --> 38:40.000
Some housekeeping before we get into other gaming news tonight.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
Next week of course E3 in two weeks.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
Orange Lounge Radio turns 15 years old.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
That's right.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
We'll be here on what night even is that?

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
June 18th if I'm not mistaken.

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
June 18th we'll be here to celebrate 15 years of Orange Lounge Radio.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
And you might ask what big thing do we have planned?

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
Same old thing we usually do.

39:03.000 --> 39:08.000
I've given up on celebrating every anniversary and every multiple of 100 episodes and all this stuff.

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
Maybe I'm still looking into what we can do a little special for episode 700.

39:13.000 --> 39:21.000
But for our 15th year celebration I think it's best we just do what we've been doing and keep doing that.

39:21.000 --> 39:29.000
Maybe have a little more time to take calls and so forth so y'all can call in and say whatever you want to say about 15 years of the show.

39:29.000 --> 39:34.000
But for that I just don't see why we wouldn't change the formula we've had for so long.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
And I don't want to make it three hours about just us.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Well now it's our Patreon.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
No. No.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Yeah I just don't want to make it three hours about us.

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
So we'll get into news and all that stuff as well. It'll be fun.

39:47.000 --> 39:53.000
And then in three weeks our reward for turning 15 years old is a vacation.

39:53.000 --> 40:00.000
We won't be here on June 25th.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
So enjoy that week off.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
I'm out of town.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
Darsaka's out of town.

40:05.000 --> 40:11.000
Loki is not a town but it's gonna have a night off so maybe he can actually play some games or write a game or I don't know.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
I'm gonna go see Guardians of the Galaxy 2.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
There you go.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
My kid doesn't want to watch the first one.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Is it still gonna be in theaters in three weeks?

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
Cheap theater maybe.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Yeah maybe cheap theater.

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
I will find a theater that has it or I'll go see like I'm sure there's gonna be other movies out there.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
Yeah there will.

40:25.000 --> 40:32.000
But if any listener is gonna be in the San Francisco area for Pride let me know.

40:32.000 --> 40:39.000
Yeah I guess I could say the same thing about Chicago. I wasn't really planning any sort of meet up or whatever but we'll see what's out there.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
Go to support.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Yeah just have fun.

40:42.000 --> 40:49.000
Alright let's get into some gaming news and what's been going on around the game industry this week as we ramp up to E3. Loki.

40:49.000 --> 40:56.000
In like I really thought that this already had happened news. The PlayStation 3 has ended production in Japan.

40:56.000 --> 41:06.000
That's right. I guess the 500 gigabyte standard model was the only remaining model available in Japan and it's stopped shipping.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
So that's quite a long time. Eleven years.

41:09.000 --> 41:14.000
I feel like the PlayStation 2 just ended a couple years ago.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
Yeah I think so too. That's totally produced.

41:17.000 --> 41:22.000
The total shelf life I feel like was a little longer for 2 than it was for 3.

41:22.000 --> 41:31.000
But you know again obviously a lot of stuff has just moved on to PlayStation 4. I don't think PlayStation 3 really had any new titles planned for this year.

41:31.000 --> 41:36.000
Aside from well Persona. They got Persona 5 because that was promised on PlayStation 3.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
They have actually surprisingly enough they still have stuff coming out for the PlayStation 3.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
Do they really?

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Yeah like in fact I want to see next week.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
Sports ball games?

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Kids games.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Oh okay.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Like I know the Cars 3 games coming out on PlayStation 3.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Okay but those come out on every platform.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
Yeah pretty much.

41:50.000 --> 41:55.000
So and then the Final Fantasy 14 expansion is not PlayStation 3.

41:55.000 --> 42:02.000
They are going because that was like wasn't that the last game to come out on PlayStation 2 was a Final Fantasy 11 expansion? I feel like it was.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Yes.

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
So the Final Fantasy 14 expansion they they and there was this big to do about it.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
They are ending PlayStation 3 support in two weeks.

42:10.000 --> 42:16.000
If you're playing Final Fantasy 14 on PlayStation 3 you can no longer play not even like you can't even play the vanilla regular game.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
It's you're you're losing access to the game completely.

42:19.000 --> 42:28.000
However Square Enix is doing a free if you buy a PlayStation 4 they'll they'll upgrade your license so that you can play Final Fantasy 14 on PlayStation 4.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
They're not going to make you re-buy that game.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
So that was a nice thing for them to do.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
But very interesting that they are pulling because this is something they never did with Final Fantasy 11.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
That they probably could have done a long time before.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
But yeah so going to be very interesting.

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
But that could have been one of the last PlayStation 3 titles but they are not doing it.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
So that's it.

42:46.000 --> 42:54.000
Dungeon Buster 3 in chat over at live.vognetware.com says I love my PlayStation 3 even when it sounds like a leaf blower.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
Yeah I mean there's still a lot to love about PlayStation 3.

42:57.000 --> 43:02.000
I mean it's not that it's a bad console or whatever it's just you know it's life cycle is done.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Sony is more interested in moving on to PlayStation 4.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
The original model you could kill a man with it.

43:07.000 --> 43:11.000
Yes you could.

43:11.000 --> 43:16.000
Let's see JD in chat pointing out PS2 ended in 2012.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
So I guess it was a little.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Yeah it wasn't that long ago then.

43:20.000 --> 43:25.000
Yeah considering it was what 6 or 7 years between consoles.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
It's only been 4 years since they pulled.

43:27.000 --> 43:34.000
That's what I'm saying is that that period seems shorter than the actual weight between the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation 3 if that makes sense.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Anyway.

43:36.000 --> 43:42.000
Let's move on and talk about some E3 things coming up including what's going to be happening with Ubisoft.

43:42.000 --> 43:47.000
Ubisoft apparently has a new IP to reveal at E3.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
They did a teaser trailer this week.

43:50.000 --> 43:57.000
But it's of course a bunch of jokes because they redacted half the things in the trailer meaning there are surprises coming.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
So yeah.

43:59.000 --> 44:05.000
Let me guess is it going to be Just Dance 2017 or 18 whatever year that they're doing now?

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Is that what it's going to be?

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
I think that's probably a given that there's some type of Just Dance game coming out.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
But I think that's kind of not the highlight.

44:13.000 --> 44:18.000
But what is interesting to point out I did not see an announcement that Aisha Tyler would be hosting.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
So sadly it doesn't appear she's going to be doing that.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
She's probably very busy though with all the stuff.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
She had a movie coming out or something she was around promoting.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
So yeah.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Anyway so the Ubisoft thing is coming.

44:31.000 --> 44:35.000
We know one thing we're going to hear more about is the Mario plus Rabbid games.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
Although I would have thought this was one they were going to let Nintendo reveal.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
Although thanks to the leaks who knows.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
But some more details about the game came out.

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
Some more leaks from their leaky sources within Ubisoft.

44:47.000 --> 44:52.000
Ubisoft was apparently the one that came up with the idea and they went through the pitch process with Nintendo.

44:52.000 --> 44:56.000
The game apparently was in the works for the Wii U at first.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
But obviously the Wii U kind of ended abruptly and everything shifted over to the Switch.

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
So this game kind of went with that as well.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
It's being made by Ubisoft Paris and Milan.

45:07.000 --> 45:11.000
Most of it being handled in Milan such as the core creative direction.

45:11.000 --> 45:16.000
Nintendo is overseeing it and approving ideas but they've been pretty quick to approve things.

45:16.000 --> 45:21.000
Ubisoft is still kind of the brains behind it.

45:21.000 --> 45:25.000
Apparently there was a Donkey Kong themed Rabbid that was one of the boss encounters at one point.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
No word if that is still there or not.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
So there you go.

45:30.000 --> 45:36.000
Let's see. It says though that when this boss faints, the Princess Peach Rabbid will take a selfie with him.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
After he faints.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
That sounds cute I guess.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Oh my god that's so current and hilarious.

45:42.000 --> 45:48.000
Well to be fair, D.Va has a very similar little thing in Overwatch that she does for one of her play of the game poses.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
So eh, what can you do?

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
Anyway, there was an additional mode named Arena that was apparently in the UI.

45:54.000 --> 45:58.000
Maybe something that would help the game kind of have an online life I suppose.

45:58.000 --> 46:03.000
So yeah, also apparently amiibo figures being prototyped.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
I know. Try to contain your shock and awe.

46:06.000 --> 46:10.000
But these Rabbid figures will probably be out in amiibo form at some point.

46:10.000 --> 46:15.000
The game was originally supposed to be unveiled during the January switch event.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
But it got pushed back to get a little more polish.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
It will be revealed at E3 and released in August or September.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
That's all the latest rumors with this game.

46:23.000 --> 46:31.000
But you know, when you've got a leak that shows you the fucking art, it's pretty hard to deny that it's happening.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Not impossible, but hard.

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
I mean, anyone can make a leak, we know that.

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
We're not gonna confirm nor deny it.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
Anyone can take a leak?

46:42.000 --> 46:47.000
This one's got a little more substance behind it than most of the pre-E3 stuff.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
So it's poop?

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
Yes.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Moving on, DarkSagra.

46:52.000 --> 47:01.000
Well, people have been talking a bit about the online service for the Switch from Nintendo that should launch in 2008.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
The announcement...

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
You mean 2018?

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
He said 2008.

47:07.000 --> 47:11.000
Well, it's hard to be confused when the tech is from 2008.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
That's when it should have launched. I'm just kidding.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Anyway, 2018.

47:15.000 --> 47:23.000
At any rate, they are saying that since it's gonna come out then and it will be a $20 a month charge, 1999,

47:23.000 --> 47:28.000
they're going to leave the online competitive and cooperative multiplayer features free until then.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Just another small correction, it's 20 a year.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
That's what I said annually.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
You said, but your words out of your mouth said month.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
It's okay, $20 a year.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Oh my god.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
That's why we're here.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
I should have taken you up on the coffee.

47:44.000 --> 47:51.000
Anyway, well, they are going to have an option where you pay $3.99 a month or $7.99 for three months.

47:51.000 --> 48:02.000
But the online service is going to have retro games to download, including Super Mario 3, Balloon Fight, Dr. Mario, some of the other items.

48:02.000 --> 48:07.000
To play free during that time period, you will have to have a Nintendo account.

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
For real. An actual Nintendo account. Not a month.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
In 2008.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
Teen.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
I was saying not a month in 2008.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
I get it. I get it.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
I was correct.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Yes, you were being self preferential. I get it.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
Next story.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
Well, no, we got to talk a little bit about this because this is a huge change, right, Loki?

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
There's a huge change going on here.

48:30.000 --> 48:38.000
This whole classic game thing, certainly notable, that they're talking about that the classic game thing is an online library that you'll have access to.

48:38.000 --> 48:50.000
So basically, it sounds, and I kind of still feel like we're reading into what they're saying, but it sounds like this is a Netflix model for the classic game library that they're going to put out there.

48:50.000 --> 48:55.000
So it's no longer, they're no longer talking this whole one game a month or whatever.

48:55.000 --> 49:00.000
It is, to be fair, what a lot of us have been asking for. A Netflix library for classic games.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Yeah, I've lowered those expectations quite a bit.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
Okay.

49:03.000 --> 49:07.000
I mean, I don't think it's going to be anything like that. I think it's going to be a couple games you have access to to play.

49:08.000 --> 49:15.000
So instead of being oh so generous and giving you one game to play per month, because that's really stupid, they're giving you a few games per month to play.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
And that's it. I'm hoping...

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
But you don't think they're going to like turn one off? Why would they turn a game off?

49:21.000 --> 49:26.000
I don't know that. I mean, all I'm saying is I don't anticipate there being a huge library of games.

49:26.000 --> 49:32.000
I hope there is. I mean, it'd be nice. But does this mean that there's not going to be a virtual console?

49:32.000 --> 49:37.000
That's what I'm curious about, because now that I've heard this, I'm kind of wary on...

49:37.000 --> 49:46.000
Well, it's not just this, but then the fact that Neo Geo games have been coming out like crazy on the Switch through the whole arcade archive thing.

49:46.000 --> 49:54.000
So, I mean, Neo Geo was a virtual console thing before, but now there's at least 10 of those Neo Geo games available on the Switch.

49:54.000 --> 50:04.000
So that's not falling under the virtual console banner. So I am kind of at a pause going, well, maybe virtual console is not a thing then.

50:04.000 --> 50:11.000
This is what we're getting instead. But with this, they said there was a little something in that comment that said,

50:11.000 --> 50:16.000
we're working on trying to get Super Nintendo games to work, but it's not going to be available right away.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
So I'm paraphrasing.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
Are you fucking kidding me? I'm sorry.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
It's the online part. The online part is the important part.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Are you sure it's the online part?

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
Yes, the online part.

50:26.000 --> 50:32.000
Because online part, I mean, they have emulators that play Super Nintendo games online that have been out since the 90s.

50:32.000 --> 50:41.000
I mean, I just, I can't anymore. Like, you're talking about the company that made the fucking...

50:41.000 --> 50:49.000
They designed the fucking hardware for this shit, and they can't fucking figure out how to turn a game that came out literally in the 90s

50:49.000 --> 50:58.000
and make it play over the internet. Like, are you fucking me? Are you seriously fucking, seriously saying this,

50:58.000 --> 51:03.000
that you can't do this shit? How fucking inept are you that you can't do this?

51:03.000 --> 51:10.000
To be fair, it's, it's kind of still vague. I don't think we have a hard line on what exactly the games are,

51:10.000 --> 51:17.000
how many there's going to be. I actually do kind of feel to a point, people do need to approach this with caution,

51:17.000 --> 51:23.000
because I've seen a lot of the hot takes out there on blogs and things are like, Nintendo's going to open the vault of NES games,

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
and you're going to be able to play them all for 20 bucks a month.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
I would love that.

51:26.000 --> 51:35.000
No, you're not. No, you are not. You are going to be able to play a handful that Nintendo takes through a painstaking QA process,

51:35.000 --> 51:42.000
the way that they do a virtual console games, and there will be a few a month, but I don't think they're going to, like, end date them or anything.

51:42.000 --> 51:46.000
I think, I think when this thing opens and launches, there'll be, like, five games.

51:46.000 --> 51:53.000
And yeah, you'll be able to play those all with your monthly, or, now I'm doing it too, your yearly subscription fee or whatever,

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
and then the next month there might be two more, and then the month after that, two more, kind of like Netflix,

51:57.000 --> 52:05.000
you're going to add to it a little bit at a time, but don't expect the floodgates to be open with fucking 100 games when this thing launches.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
That ain't happening.

52:06.000 --> 52:14.000
I would say best case scenario, and this is absolute best case scenario, it's the same 30 games on the NES Classic.

52:14.000 --> 52:22.000
Here's a weird idea. I know it's kind of crazy. Why not just, I don't know, put out that fucking library of 100 games, but hey, guess what?

52:22.000 --> 52:28.000
Only some of them have multiplayer support right now, and as we go along, we're going to add support to more games.

52:28.000 --> 52:34.000
Doesn't that seem fucking reasonable? Like, oh my God, like, I must be a fucking genius that can run a company like Nintendo,

52:34.000 --> 52:40.000
because I literally came up, I literally shit out that idea right now with like no fucking forethought,

52:40.000 --> 52:45.000
but oh, it's too fucking hard for me to put fucking networking into an old-ass game.

52:45.000 --> 52:51.000
Fucking emulators have had this shit for years now. Their emulators are so fucking sophisticated,

52:51.000 --> 52:57.000
you can trick your own fucking online store into thinking it's a real system so you can buy games from it.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
That's ridiculous.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
I think I've gone deaf in one ear.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
What else is new on this show?

53:04.000 --> 53:11.000
To be fair, there are, like, all NES games don't emulate the same. You know that.

53:11.000 --> 53:15.000
There's different mappers that go with different NES games. Some of them are more challenging to emulate than others.

53:15.000 --> 53:20.000
So, I get in that regard, they can't just open the floodgates, and it's, oh, every single NES game,

53:20.000 --> 53:26.000
and plus, then you throw the whole third-party angle into it, and not every Nintendo game was made by Nintendo.

53:26.000 --> 53:32.000
Some of the big classics are Konami, Square, Capcom, you know, they have to get them to sign on board, too.

53:32.000 --> 53:36.000
So I would say almost the legal part probably holds shit up more than the technical part half the time.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
I know, my Raspberry Pi really struggles with Contra.

53:38.000 --> 53:46.000
But your Raspberry Pi is illegal. It's not legal. I mean, it's that whole, like, gray area sort of thing and that whole thing.

53:46.000 --> 53:50.000
But this is the difference between what's illegal and what's legal.

53:50.000 --> 53:55.000
So the Raspberry Pi is illegal. You can sugarcoat it however you want, but that's what it is.

53:55.000 --> 53:59.000
The virtual console service or whatever it ends up being on the Switch is legal.

53:59.000 --> 54:09.000
And I think half the time it's probably a legal battle that gets these games tied up, because legal shit takes a very, very, very long time.

54:09.000 --> 54:17.000
Now, that being said, Loki, Nintendo sure did produce a lot of games on their own, especially when the NES first launched.

54:17.000 --> 54:21.000
The entire launch library was games they made, like 15 or 20 of them.

54:21.000 --> 54:29.000
So in that regard, I don't see a reason why Nintendo can't put a lot of their games available on the service,

54:29.000 --> 54:37.000
but perhaps they feel there is strength in drip-feeding it a little bit instead of opening the floodgates at once.

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
That's surely how they've been treating their consoles' supply.

54:40.000 --> 54:44.000
Yeah, but Loki, when they didn't do that, they got beat up over it.

54:44.000 --> 54:49.000
That's what happened with the Wii U. The Wii U was a failure because you put all these games out at once,

54:49.000 --> 54:53.000
and then there was nothing for an entire year, practically.

54:53.000 --> 54:58.000
So, Loki, which way is it going to be? Is it going to be all at once, or is it going to be a drip-feed?

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Because Nintendo sure can't seem to win that battle either way.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
It wasn't a failure because they put out a bunch of games.

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
It was a failure because they didn't have third-party support for the system,

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
because they chose to market a system that was underpowered at the time,

55:08.000 --> 55:13.000
and they couldn't pick up the third-party games that were running on more powerful engines that wouldn't run on that system,

55:13.000 --> 55:17.000
despite the fact that they were saying, hey, look at this, it's more powerful than the Xbox 360.

55:17.000 --> 55:21.000
Well, yeah, that may be true, but it's not as powerful as the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

55:21.000 --> 55:25.000
and it can't run fucking Battlefield or Call of Duty or all that other shit.

55:25.000 --> 55:30.000
I mean, sure, it ran Call of Duty, but eventually they stopped making it for it or all the other stuff.

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
So that's what killed the system, not because they put out too many fucking virtual console games.

55:34.000 --> 55:39.000
So, but I just don't know where this leaves virtual console.

55:39.000 --> 55:44.000
Are we now towards this? Because here's the thing, if they do put out Mother 3,

55:44.000 --> 55:49.000
I fully expect that that's going to be a standalone thing that's not tied to any type of virtual console banner or anything.

55:49.000 --> 55:53.000
It's just going to be, hey, Mother 3 is out now on the Switch. It's a port.

55:53.000 --> 55:58.000
And that's it. I kind of think this whole virtual console thing may move to this Nintendo premium thing.

55:58.000 --> 56:03.000
So I'm now less hopeful that we're getting a virtual console at E3.

56:03.000 --> 56:09.000
I just, I mean, really, all they have to do is just put out the content and price it right, and people would buy it.

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
Like, look at my fucking Steam library and PlayStation library.

56:12.000 --> 56:16.000
It's stuff I buy on an impulse because the pricing is right.

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
It may not be something like, oh, that looks like fun. I might play that, you know, and then I buy it.

56:20.000 --> 56:25.000
And same with virtual console. If they price it, like, I'd say maybe like $5 at the most.

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
Maybe, you know, throw some stuff out there for a dollar or two, whatever.

56:28.000 --> 56:38.000
I'd be picking up shit that I might play. I may not necessarily play, but I certainly have a large, you know, catalog of that stuff available to me.

56:38.000 --> 56:47.000
And that's more money to them than if I'm paying them $3 a month for this quote-unquote online service that has this stuff available.

56:47.000 --> 56:52.000
I just think there's more money for them to be made, and they just need to do it right.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
And that's the problem, is they're not.

56:54.000 --> 57:02.000
So Act F is linking me to this article over on Forbes, which, first off, almost anybody can write for that website.

57:03.000 --> 57:10.000
So my guard is already up going on to here, but let me see if they had actually got a quote here from this.

57:10.000 --> 57:18.000
So, okay, speaking with Famitsu, a Nintendo rep said that the classic game selection tentative name is different from the virtual console.

57:18.000 --> 57:22.000
Meanwhile, the timeline for virtual console sale is still undecided.

57:22.000 --> 57:26.000
So, here's the thing, though.

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
Okay, so Nintendo might be saying that and all.

57:30.000 --> 57:37.000
One, plans change, because this was not supposed to be what was going to happen for the online service, so plans change.

57:37.000 --> 57:42.000
Online service was supposed to be out this year, and it was going to be one game a month, so plans change.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
In some ways, for the better, yes.

57:44.000 --> 57:51.000
But then the other thing with the whole virtual console is, doesn't that muddy the waters a little bit?

57:51.000 --> 57:55.000
Okay, here's what I think it's going to be. I know what it is.

57:55.000 --> 58:01.000
Classic game selection is going to be the really old stuff. NES, Super Nintendo, if they can get it working and all that stuff.

58:01.000 --> 58:08.000
Virtual console, when they sell you Wii games on the Wii U, they call that virtual console.

58:08.000 --> 58:13.000
So you know what virtual console is going to be? GameCube games. On the Switch.

58:13.000 --> 58:17.000
That's going to be virtual console. It's going to be the newer games. It's not going to be the really old stuff.

58:17.000 --> 58:21.000
But again, that's a prediction. That's not necessarily what will happen.

58:21.000 --> 58:27.000
But I think I can sort of see where that division is going to come into play.

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
Is that it's going to be like GameCube games will be virtual console.

58:30.000 --> 58:40.000
Which could be great, because it would give people a way to experience Metroid Prime before perhaps Retro announces a new Metroid Prime game or something in that universe.

58:40.000 --> 58:44.000
That would be exciting. But I think that could be where the division is at.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
So, we'll see.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
And hey, you'd have F-Zero in your console.

58:48.000 --> 58:54.000
If they actually do it and they put F-Zero GX on the Switch, or AX, yeah GX.

58:54.000 --> 58:58.000
If they put F-Zero GX on the Switch, fuck yeah I'm buying it, of course I am.

58:58.000 --> 59:02.000
And you are too, if you get a Switch at some point.

59:02.000 --> 59:08.000
Alright. Moving on. That was plenty enough on Nintendo's online service.

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
So let's talk about Nintendo's online service.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
Fuck.

59:12.000 --> 59:18.000
Let's do that. Because you know, it's not that ridiculous that they're putting in an online service.

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
Now what is ridiculous is how they're having you do chat.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
And that's just a whole bunch of fun stuff.

59:23.000 --> 59:29.000
So this came out from a picture of a new headset that's being put out there.

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
That's a whole Splatoon themed.

59:32.000 --> 59:37.000
And so it kind of gives a diagram of how this would connect up with your system.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
So basically, you have your headset.

59:39.000 --> 59:42.000
It has a splitter that's shaped like a squid.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
You know, cute and everything.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
One half of that goes to your Nintendo Switch.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
The other half goes to your phone.

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
So basically you're using your phone to chat.

59:51.000 --> 59:55.000
And you're using your Nintendo Switch for game audio.

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
And it's all mixing together in your headset.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
And so where people have trouble with this, it's just great.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I've got all these dongles now.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Imagine if you're going playing this out somewhere.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
You have to carry all this shit with you in order to do that with your headset.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:17.000
To which I think, I don't know why they couldn't just integrate that shit into the system.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
I don't know why it has to be a separate app.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
They haven't really explained why that needs to be.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I'm holding off judgement on this whole thing until Splatoon 2 is out.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And we have more information on how this works.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
But honestly, Loki, with the technology, the minute we heard it was a smartphone app.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
And this is the way they're going to do it.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
How would this not be?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I mean, I kind of think people are blowing this way out of proportion.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Because, A, there are certainly headsets for Xbox and Playstation.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
That when they're wired are very similar types of setups.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I own a fucking headset that does this exact same thing.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Because it purposely does integrate your smartphone into the whole thing.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000
So that you can be playing Playstation and take calls and all this stuff.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Which, I don't know why I bought that headset, but I have it.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
The way they're doing this is not completely unheard of.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000
How else would you get two different inputs into one headset?

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Yes, there's going to be a split.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Couldn't they have a wireless solution to that though?

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
They could have done Bluetooth integration.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000
That would be the way to get around this and have the smartphone do Bluetooth over to the system.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
And then the system pumps all the audio through.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.000
But maybe they are worried about that 1% CPU loss overhead or something.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I don't know what it is.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.000
But again, this is also the schematics of one third party app solution.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I'm not sure I'm hearing.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Chat, correct me if I'm wrong.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:47.000
This is not necessarily the end all be all the way it will be done 100% of the time.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
But this is all we have to go on right now.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
This is all we have to go on right now.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
But again, I take you back to the original question.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000
When you were told it was a smartphone app, how the fuck else was it going to happen through one headset?

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I don't know. Plans change.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
How about some common sense and realize, hey, maybe we should just integrate this shit into our console.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Like all the other game consoles out there.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
It's how they should have done it because it's ridiculous.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Why is it through an app?

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Why is it through an app?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Show me why that has to be done through an app.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Please explain that to me.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
So, couple interesting things here.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Dark Tetsuya says, wouldn't Bluetooth have interfered with the Joy-Cons?

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I thought there was some limitation on the Joy-Cons because of the Bluetooth thing.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
So, that could be, to be fair.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000
And Act Deft also points out, one thing to know about this, Nintendo isn't making it.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
It's HORI that's doing this.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
So, this is not...

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Yeah, but HORI has to get the specifications from someone.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
They're not just coming up with this shit on their own.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
So, that's fine.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I will wait until Nintendo shows me what the official solution is going to be.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
But I'm having a feeling it's going to be this.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
And I still don't understand why it has to be that way.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000
To be fair, and I think this is something else we need to hear out.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I think we're all going to the direction of Nintendo's smartphone app is going to be...

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
That's all it's going to do is the voice chat.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:10.000
But I believe the app Nintendo plans to put out is going to be more than voice chat.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
It's not just the voice chat solution.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
But they've had this whole talk about scheduling play sessions.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:25.000
That it might be more of a, dare I say it, social network type of app for Nintendo gamers.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Which could be very interesting.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
But if Nintendo didn't do this, and Nintendo said,

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
you know what, we're not going to do voice chat just like we didn't do on the Wii U.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
How is everybody getting voice chat on the Wii U?

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Through apps.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
So, is this really going to be that different in that regard?

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I still want to hear Nintendo's big vision on this whole thing out.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
That's all I'm saying is that the app is going to be more than voice chat.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Because they've indicated as much.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
So let's hear what the big story is on this.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
You have a game console that runs software.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Why can't you run an app on there for that?

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Why can't you integrate this into the OS?

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Why does this have to be a separate device that you do this with?

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
It's just mind boggling stupid.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
That's not Nintendo's fault, that's your fault.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.000
It's my fault that I told them to design a console that can't fucking handle voice chat in games?

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
No, it's because everybody is glued to their fucking smartphones.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000
And the investors said, Nintendo, you need to be doing more with smartphones.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Because everybody's on Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, Nintendo, you need a piece of that.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000
So if you want to blame somebody, blame all the people that said Nintendo needed to go mobile.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Because guess what, they're doing it and now you're getting mad at them.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I'm sorry.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000
That's like telling somebody you need to go mobile and then they're fucking retarded and make a stupid decision like this.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
You know, don't get me wrong, they're making mobile games.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
That's them going mobile.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Their investors didn't say, well you need the fucking shoehorn or goddamn phone in there to make it work like we want it to.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Okay, your investors are fucking retarded then.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I'm sorry, nobody that's putting money into a company is going to say, this is a great fucking idea.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Nobody.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Look at all the other hardware developers out there, all the other consoles.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Is anybody doing it that way?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
No.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Why?

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Because it doesn't make any fucking sense.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Because their systems are like, well maybe we should just put the fucking voice chat and shit in the console.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Because that would be easier for people instead of having to, you know, especially let's say we're going to sell this to the kids.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Okay, because Splatoon's for kids and all that stuff.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Okay, so now I've got to loan my phone to my kids so that they can voice chat over the internet and stuff like that.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Because this is the way it's got to fucking be.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
And yes, I get it.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Oh, well your kids shouldn't be talking to strangers over the internet.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
But that's okay because it has friend codes, you know, so you're only going to be talking to your buddy buddies and all that stuff.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
It's stupid.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
It is honestly stupid.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Well, let me just fire up my PlayStation app that Sony put together on the mobile device.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:01.000
And let me see all these things that Sony has done on the mobile phone, yet nobody seems to be critical.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
No, go ahead.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Let's hear your wonderful comeback here and I will lovely shoot it down for you.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Go right ahead. Please.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
I can look at my friends list and my what's new.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Oh, I can map to another app if I want to take a look at my messages because it won't show me that in my main app.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I can apparently go on to PlayStation now, but I don't think I can actually play the games here on this app and so forth.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
But where was all the hatred for this?

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
You know why? Because you can do that shit on the fucking console as well.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Guess what? If I didn't have that app or a phone, I'm not fucking losing features because guess what?

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.000
I can just go into the system, go up to my fucking friends list and I can send messages.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I can chat online. I can fucking play against people across the Internet.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I don't need a fucking phone and app to do that because it's integrating the goddamn system.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I got another great. I got another great word for you. Are you ready? Smart glass.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
That's Microsoft's stupid shit.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
And did it ever go anywhere? No.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:06.000
You know why? Because all that shit's fucking integrated into the goddamn system. They just realized they needed a second screen.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.000
It wasn't. Not the stuff that they were doing with the whole Dance Central and all this stuff that they were doing.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
But anyway.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.000
It was. That was unnecessary bullshit that they were doing with it. It was. It was just.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Let me. Let's try to bring it back to the Switch here on how unnecessary it was.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Like all the one, two Switch games that really could have been played without, you know, waggling the controllers around.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Did it really? Do we really need to have that? I mean.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
They put out a lot of gimmicky shit to try to demonstrate the device.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I mean, same with Kinect. Kinect had a lot of stupid shit too.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
But they realized it was a failure and they quit it.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000
And they didn't also use that for matchmaking, for setting up party chat.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
It wasn't the exclusive way to do that.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Alright. ActDeft in chat says, I get Loki's point but at the same time I don't think Loki gets Nintendo's point either.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Well, I mean, we don't really know Nintendo's point.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
We'll find out more in a little over a week.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
So on that note, let's move on because we still have a long show ahead.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
So I want to talk a little bit about Metroid.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Oh yes, you know, it seems like we're all anticipating that maybe Metroid could make a comeback.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:18.000
But, you know, it seems like it's a long shot unfortunately. We don't know anything for sure.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
But apparently.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I didn't realize this, but apparently Archie Comics, who, you know, does Archie.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
But they also do other comics as well, right?

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Sabrina the Teenage Witch.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Sure, Josie the Pussycats was a little Archie thing, right?

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
And all these other people we're seeing on Riverdale, right?

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000
That's all the Archie universe.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000
That looks like a very edgy show based on the Netflix banner that they have up there.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Well, Archie also did a Mega Man comic at one point, but they pitched a Metroid comic in 2009.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:53.000
So there were concepts from comic book artist Steven Butler who created some concepts in 2011.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
And Butler was even paid by Archie for this.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
2011, however, was right around the same time that Other M came out.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000
So apparently Nintendo did not jump in on this idea.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000
So this comic book was unfortunately never fully realized.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000
But you can see some of the sketches around out there floating around the internet.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I guess Steven Butler actually posted some of this on his Facebook this week.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.000
So, bummer, because if Metroid had become part of the Archie universe, then maybe Samus could have shown up on Riverdale.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
That would have been kind of awesome.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
That would have been weird.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
That would have been awesome.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Maybe not so much, but it's fun to imagine.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Dark Sakura.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Well, we do have something about Valve.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:40.000
And I know Bobby touched on it in detail on his show, but I'm going to talk about it anyway.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Valve is getting away from Steam Greenlight.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000
It's kind of brought up before. What they're doing in its place is called Steam Direct.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:10:02.000
So basically, instead of gathering support from the community to get onto Steam, all the developers have to do is pay a $100 publishing fee for the game that they can recoup after the game hits $1,000 in sales.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Basically, Greenlight has a $100 fee, but you pay it once. This is going to be per game.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
And I mean, it could have been much more.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000
It could have been I think they had talked like up to five grand.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:27.000
But now they said they were also even considering that they had it hovering around the $500 mark, but they think that it's best to keep it as low as possible.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:36.000
So now for $100, people can get their game into the store.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:44.000
And I think it also will just avoid... what's a good word to think about it?

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:51.000
It could avoid being able to put in things that may not be quite as...

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Fart Simulator 2017.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Okay, that.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:07.000
At the same time, $100, even if somebody that doesn't have it themselves, you know, if you're working with other people, I mean, or shoot, I mean, a Kickstarter for 100 bucks?

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
We need $100 to get this game on Steam.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Yeah.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Easy peasy.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Right. And I think you get the $100 back if you get like $1,000 in sales.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000
That's what I said.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Here's the thing. It's a tricky line because yes, I'm all for more indie developers being able to have access to this.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:31.000
And you know, somebody with the next great big idea, great idea in gaming may not have the budget to be able to drop $500 or whatever to get their game on Steam.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
So that's fine. I'm all for more people being able to have access to the store.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:44.000
However, there's going to have to be a serious step up on Valve's part with curating what all is in the store and being able to recognize when Fart Simulator 2017 comes.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Because it's inevitable. You put this bar at $100. Anybody can sign up. Fart Simulator 2017 is coming.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
It already has.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Valve, okay, then Valve needs to sandbag that shit to the bottom of the store where people aren't finding it.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Here's this.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000
What?

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:11.000
They pay their $100 per shitty game. Or per great game. The ones that are going to make the money and then get their $100 back are the good games.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:19.000
In theory, I mean, unless Fart Simulator people have like a bajillion friends, I don't know. Or people go, hello Fart Simulator.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:26.000
It's almost if I could just open 100 million robot accounts to upvote things or write fake tweets.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.000
But now it's based on money. People have to purchase this content.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Oh, so in other words, okay, so they sort of do that with the ratings now. I get where you're going with that.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:43.000
And they sort of do that with the ratings now. Like, they show on the ratings, like, how long have you played this? But I get where you're going with that.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Yeah, people have to actually put out the money for it instead of just saying, oh, I like this.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:55.000
So now, you mean, a person can get their game out without having just the people like the concept or like the, you know, what they've seen of the game.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:03.000
But the real test is going to come if the game makes money. And so if it makes money, then great. The people will get their $100 back.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
If it doesn't, Steam has your $100.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:13.000
I feel like the Apple, iTunes and Google Play stores are doing okay with that when it comes to the mobile world.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:23.000
And of course, Fart Simulator exists on those worlds as well. Doesn't Apple have like a nominal, like you have to pay like a yearly thing to get into there?

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Yeah. So they have like a nominal thing that they also have.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
You have to buy a Mac to be able to upload it onto their store.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
What's Google's thing?

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
You can get a Mac Mini for dirt cheap.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
What's Google's thing?

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I still have to buy one. Google's thing, you still have to pay membership as well.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Okay. So, I mean, these stores are going through similar things, but I also-

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
And they go through a certification process too.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000
I'm not as familiar with Google Play, admittedly, because I have an iPhone myself.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.000
But I do feel like the iTunes store is really heavily curated, at least the featured stuff.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Believe me, when it comes to podcasting, it sure is, because I mean, we were a featured gaming podcast back in 2006 when they first launched it.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:16.000
But I'd love to get featured there again, but I just don't see it happening because there's too many commercial people involved with podcasting to have better connections and so forth that tend to get their stuff featured.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:25.000
So, anyway, I'm on a tangent of sorts, but my point is iTunes has made it work because they have heavily curated for better or for worse.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:34.000
But I still feel like things like Flappy Bird, all joking aside, that game was a runaway hit and probably wasn't expected to be.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000
And that had nothing to do with iTunes curating it until it was already on the wave.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:46.000
So, I mean, you can still have a model for success there, and I think Steam could go to something similar.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:54.000
The only thing I think about the whole non-greenlight process now, granted, you know, paying $100 per game, I don't think that's going to be a barrier to entry for a lot of people.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.000
They're not going to put up crap anyways, because they're making their money, and they're supposed to be tweaking this, but so far I'm in detail on how they're going to do that.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:06.000
They make their money off of the trading cards, and the way they do that is they get a portion of every sale of those trading cards.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:12.000
So they make it super easy for you to get the trading cards, and then people, you know, they put out the game for like, say, 99 cents or something like that.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:22.000
People play the game, get the trading cards, sell the trading cards, make money off of it, and then in turn the publisher makes money off of it as well, and make money off the sale of the game.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
And they do that ad nauseam, so that's how they make their money.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
But, I don't think now that they don't...

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Well, there's something Steam can do. $100 to get your game on Steam, $1,000 to get it with cards.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Well, they're still going to tweak that at some point. I'm not sure how it is going to be tweaked with the whole trading card stuff to try to curtail that, but I think right now, one of the things that I'm kind of...

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:59.000
I mean, I guess it's a good and a bad thing, so it's good that you don't have to get through the green light process, although it wasn't all that difficult to do that, but the stuff that's truly crap out there, though...

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:07.000
I mean, that's not going to have to go through the green light process, it's just going to get pooped onto the store, basically, for $100.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:13.000
So, I mean, there's still going to be shit on there. It seems like almost there's less oversight regarding the whole thing.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:22.000
I know that they went into details on how they were going to do that, like there's going to be ways to report if the game's broken, because there are a lot of games that are released on there that just don't work, period.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:30.000
I mean, it's just not functional. So that's a big thing. At least there's a stream refund, so there's that kind of process. I don't know.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:46.000
It's just going to take a whole lot of growing and more of actual people looking at it through Valve. Valve and YouTube, they want to take this whole hands-off approach with content curation.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:51.000
That's just not... You can't do that. Algorithms haven't worked.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Only go so far. Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week. Loki.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:07.000
So, Twitch has played something else now. This time, they're playing the stock market. That's right. So apparently, there is an Amazon engineer, Mike Roberts.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:20.000
He has put $50,000 of his savings into this app that's basically a stock market ticker. So think of how they had with the whole Twitch plays Pokemon, where people would vote on different things.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:32.000
So they would be, you know, buy this stock, sell this stock in this case. So after there's been a certain five-minute time, it'll go ahead and do the action of whatever's been voted highest.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:46.000
And so, you know, so far he's actually made a little bit of money to it. The game will continue until his money is down below $25,000, which I guess apparently is a FINRA regulation.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:56.000
So if he's below that amount, then it's basically over. But that's kind of crazy to put that amount of money on the line for people to just play Twitch.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Look at all this press coverage. It's got him.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Yeah, he's got a lot of press coverage. There's a lot of people really enthusiastic about it. And he's kind of making money right now. So, cool.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Cool. Have you checked? I have to admit, I have not checked this out whatsoever.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I haven't checked it out yet, but if you are interested to take a look at it, it's at twitch.tv slash stock stream. So go take a look and see where he's at.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.000
In fact, I'm just kind of taking a peek right now to see how much money...

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
How they made money.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000
How much money has he made? Let's see. Well, the market's closed right now.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Right. Of course.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Most recent video. Let's see where he's at. He's up $700,000. He's $700. So $764.91. Not bad.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Not bad.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Yeah, I mean, that was up a percent, looks like.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:52.000
But the stock market's also been doing well in general. Didn't they hit another record on Thursday or something like that?

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:58.000
And that was at the beginning. So let me try to see what did I see at the end here. $765.47. Not bad.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Alright. Good job Twitch.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Apparently this is doing pretty well.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Maybe I need to put some money up. No, just kidding. I'm not going to.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Alright. Something that you can invest in, as I'm sure is a series a lot of people invested themselves in, is Life is Strange.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Of course, this game, they practically were giving it away at some point. At least the episode one. You know, they wanted more people to play it.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I have to admit, I never got around to playing the series. It's still kind of on my list to do. But I haven't really heard a bad thing about it.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Pretty much everybody I know that's taken the time to play Life is Strange really, really enjoyed it and the story.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:37.000
In fact, most of the tweets I've seen about it were things along the line of, that game fucked me up. Those sorts of things.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:45.000
So I'm sure some people will be very pleased to hear that a prequel to the game Life is Strange is apparently in the works.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Alright, so we have some screenshots have popped up. A French website called GameCult found an image there at Deck9 Games' website.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:58.000
And it has since disappeared. So, hmm. This could be something that we're maybe hearing more about at E3.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:07.000
So, of course the leak made its way to NeoGaf. And yeah, apparently somebody over on NeoGaf said that Deck9 has actually been developing the game for some time.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.000
It's going to be exploring the relationship between two of the characters in the game.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:17.000
That might be spoilery for me to say. So, that's going to explore that a little bit in the prequel there.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:24.000
So, yeah. If you didn't know, if you've never heard of Deck9, they were called Idle Minds.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:29.000
And they have rebranded themselves and they're doing narrative driven titles.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000
So, we'll see what happens at E3 because that would be a great time to announce it.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:38.000
And could also explain why you had an image floating out there on a website that you didn't really have linked to yet.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000
I guess this whole thing was found in an imager thing somewhere. So, that's how they did it.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Anyway, let's go back to Stranger Times in the segment that we call the Classic Game of the Week.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:56.000
And every week Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Hey, you should check this out. Stop playing your narrative driven story games.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Back in my day, games didn't talk to you. You talked to them and screamed obscenities at them just like Loki does on this program.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
A game that's taken me about 20 years to get over.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000
What is your Classic Game of the Week, Dark Sakura?

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Fucking Time Crisis.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000
It is kind of narrative driven.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Is that the legal name of the game?

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Yes, it's Fucking Time Crisis.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:30.000
The reason I say that is I worked at an Amco arcade that had Time Crisis right across from the ticket counter.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000
And I had this damn intro memorized.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Your father will pay the price for destroying the imperial rule.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Whatever.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
It almost pissed me off as much as Daytona.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Anyway, Time Crisis is a first person on the rails light gun shooter game.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000
It was put out by Namco and it was released in arcades in 1995.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Because this was a Namco arcade game, it came out in the Namco arcades first.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Along with Tekken 3 at the same time. Just saying.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Anyway, it later got ported to Playstation consoles.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Which we also had this and the gun had this pedal that you'd step on for doing the dodging.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Or if you were too cheap and didn't have a pedal like I did, you can use a controller.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Okay, wait, wait, wait. I have a very important question. Sorry, Dark Sakura. I know you're in the middle of this whole thing.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000
How is this important?

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
No, no, no, no. How did this happen?

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:26.000
I'm looking at our Twitter right now. How did the classic game of the week get posted 11 minutes ago?

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
And I'm like, how does everybody in chat know what the game is already?

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Because Rama did it too soon.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Did you tell Rama to post this?

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
I did because he wouldn't be here listening tonight.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
I didn't tell him to post it early.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Spoiler alert.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
I didn't tell him to post it early.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Because I'm like, how, how can, and then like somebody even replied.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
I get a notice on my phone that somebody put don't come.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
And I'm like, how did they fucking know what the game is already?

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Don't come.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000
How did they know what the game is already?

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
This is the biggest controversy to happen at OLR all year.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Rama and I are going to have a talk.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
The classic game was ruined.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Spoiled.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:02.000
It's already a bad game. Well, not really bad, but Rama and I, we're going to have a talk.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:09.000
In fact, I'm about to email him in a moment after this and be like, bitch, actually, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I have my phone right now.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000
And hold on.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000
We're going to send out these guys to Rama's house.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Starting a new message.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Going in chat.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Let's see.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Dungeon Buster in chat says time crisis announcement announced before it's time.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Black Wolf says change it to Halo.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
YYR says nothing can ruin time crisis.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
JD says time travel crisis.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.000
And Orange Right says 11 minutes early crisis.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
I think he just guessed.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Like, oh, surely, surely they didn't get on any topics tonight that had Loki on 20 minute tangents.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Surely that didn't happen tonight.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Now is about the right time to make a post to Tumblr.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.000
I said, WTF, did you post classic game before I even did the segment?

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
I'm not, I'm acting all mad there.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
I'm not mad.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
I'm just kidding.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000
I'm not, I'm not mad at anything Nintendo and everybody's not going to notice.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I, I'm not mad either.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
There's one of those things that's funny.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000
And I was just confused.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000
I was like, how does everybody fucking know this already before I even knew it?

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Well, okay.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I did know early, but it's like, how did everybody know this already?

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Anyhow.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Come, come on.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Your disco needs you.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.000
And Chad says, Rama, your premature posting did not leave us impressed.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Now sashay away.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
LOL.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I'm not mad, but don't do it again.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.000
You have to put an emoji.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000
All right.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Look.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Okay.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Enough texting.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Tell us more about time crisis.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Texting you live.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Hi Rama.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000
All right.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
I love you.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Anyway, time crisis, all the time crisis games revolve around threats to a particular nation.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000
We are going with the first one.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:11.000
So basically you are part of a group called VSSC, Vital Situation Swift Elimination, a

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
covert organization.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:19.000
And they send their highly skilled agents with bad voice acting to solve the problem.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Anyway, you have three stages with four areas in the first game.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.000
And, um, you basically just have to go around shooting shit and, you know, not shooting

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:36.000
the innocent people and fighting bosses and big, you know, helicopters and a guy called

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
mad dog.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:44.000
But this was a game that also, one of the games that gave us gun cons.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Yay.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Gun cons.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:52.000
I love specialty controllers like probably more than I should.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:59.000
So anyway, um, with the game, you know, you also have a time limit to be able to continue

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
because of course they want to make money.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000
You don't just get infinite time.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Um, and it also has a cover system, which is one of the first games to do that.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Um, you would tap on a pedal and you go behind cover and, um, it would protect you, but you

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000
couldn't shoot.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:20.000
You'd also, as I recall, I think you also went, um, into cover to reload your gun.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:28.000
And, uh, basically, um, you'd have to clear the levels and keep going.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
I mean, basically there's a freaking gun game.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Um, you, uh, you also, um, would have, um, you could get shot at, but your, the hits

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
wouldn't be announced.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
They were called unannounced.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:52.000
So that, so that people wouldn't know that they had been hit and so they would lose lives.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Um, kind of, I'd say a cheap move.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:03.000
The whole point of it was to, uh, um, you know, make you spend more money to get through

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000
the damn game.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:11.000
But, um, the first game had Richard Miller as your main character.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:17.000
And he also showed up again in Time Crisis Project Titan, also called the One Man Army.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Um, he was also in Namco High.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000
So I think that was funny.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000
I never played his thing in Namco High.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:32.000
It just, um, anyway, you had other characters, you know, you had the president's daughter,

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Rachel McPherson and Wild Dog again.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000
I can't help but laugh because last night I was picking the story and we're watching

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000
the thing.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.000
And then, um, Dan, uh, was like, Wild Dog.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000
And I was like, okay.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
And then it came up on the screen.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
I was like, yeah, Wild Dog.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000
So anyway, um, the, the game itself is, it's fun.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000
You know, it's Time Crisis.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Um, and it spawned many, many sequels.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:07.000
I think up to Time Crisis 5 is what we're on now.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:16.000
And there was, uh, a spinoff, um, from the first Time Crisis that was Time Crisis, uh,

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Project Titan.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:24.000
And it's been, it's just Time Crisis.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Fucking annoying ass game.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Now YYR is, uh, is, um, heaping lots of praise on this game.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
And a lot of it has to do with the graphics.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
You know, that this in the arcade anyway was a 60 frames a second.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Like it was a very, very, uh, technologically superior game for 1995.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:48.000
And I think, you know, probably part of why this franchise is still going today.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000
And many of your local movie theaters probably have Time Crisis 4 or something.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I'm just annoyed by it.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
I'm so annoyed by Time Crisis.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
And I thought I was over it.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000
I really did.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Okay.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.000
It's like, you know how, like, for example, people who worked in fast food,

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
maybe traumatized by a fryer.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Maybe.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Or maybe looking at like the potato cutting machine at, you know, in and out.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Oh my God, I can't eat fries that way ever again.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000
I took my, my pal who used to work at Starbucks.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
I took her to Starbucks because I wanted to drink.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And she was like, I'm going to have a panic attack right here because everything's so disorganized.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
I know who you're talking about.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Right?

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000
I've seen it happen.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Um, but that's how I am about two games in particular.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000
This fucking bitch here.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
And Daytona.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Wild Dog.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Well YYR says this is one of my favorite games of all time.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000
I love this game.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000
And SG100Matt says YYR can beat it on one credit.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
That's pretty impressive.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Because considering how designed this game was to not let you beat it on one credit.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.000
You know what games should traumatize me?

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Huh?

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Prop Cycle.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
No, I'm kidding.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Okay.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Okay.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
My, the arcade that I worked at.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000
There it is.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Your classic.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Give me the week.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Time Crisis.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Do not do this to me because I need, I need.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000
No, no, no.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
I'm letting you vent about Prop Cycle, but we've moved on to another game.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Clearly.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:20.000
When you came into my arcade, it was like one of those long narrow stores in the mall.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
The right side was the ticket counter.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
The left side in this order.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Prop Cycle.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Time Crisis.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Daytona.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Some pinball.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
The party area.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Right in the middle of it.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Tekken 3.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Right across from it.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Street Fighter Alpha 2.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
I still have that layout memorized.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Oh yeah.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
And the other, the crane games.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
What was the other game that they rigged to run with Prop Cycle?

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.000
It was hilarious.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Addams Family.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Addams Family.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Addams Family pinball.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000
That's it.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000
How would, how would that even work?

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Why not?

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
It basically powers the table.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000
That doesn't sound like very much fun.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000
It's a good workout though.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
I don't know why someone would ruin an Addams Family with that.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
That's just what baffles me.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Prop Cycle was awesome.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000
All right.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Uh, that's going to do it for the first half of our show.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Don't go anywhere.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000
There's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:17.000
We have more news for you and our buddy YYR is going to be joining us right after a quick break.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
So don't go anywhere.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
We'll be right back.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, June the 4th of 2017, episode

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
number 689 already in progress.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Myself, Rob Roberts with you in studio and of course joined by my side as always, Dark

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Sakura or Jamie Summers and Tech Master Loki.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:49.000
And we've been having quite the spirited discussion tonight on E3 shenanigans and what could be

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:52.000
coming up next week and some of the rumors coming out of Nintendo.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:57.000
But for now, I want to go to our Skype line and say hello to an old friend of the show

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
who's sitting there on the line waiting for us.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Welcome back everybody to the program.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
YYR is here.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Hello.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
There's been a kidnapping.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000
It's Rachel, the daughter of the...

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Wait, we're still talking about time crisis, right?

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000
No, no.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Sadly, sadly, that was in the last part of the show there.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
So you just missed it, buddy.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000
You just missed it.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000
But I want to talk about some of the games you make.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
What's been new with you, my friend, in the game development world?

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Oh, man.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Well, it's been a busy weekend.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:33.000
I've been basically feverishly working on a variety of things ahead of the show because

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:38.000
what I want to talk about tonight is basically what I'm going to be focusing on for this

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:43.000
summer and this year and what I'm going to be showing at the Too Many Games convention

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:47.000
in Oaks, Pennsylvania coming up later this month.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Too many games, too many games.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Too many games.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Too many games.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Please tell me they've adapted that as their theme song.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
No, I don't think they actually have a theme song.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Ugh, they need one.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
But it's funny.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:07.000
The name of the convention is actually something of a misnomer because although their arcade

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:12.000
section has grown considerably thanks to the efforts of many, there aren't a whole lot

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
of console games there anymore.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
It's mostly just the arcade and the indies.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Huh.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Interesting.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:24.000
And of course, you can never have Too Many Games, but that's beside the point entirely.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Correct.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:32.000
But I just want to throw in before we go any further, happy pre-15, you know.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Thank you.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.000
I appreciate that.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:40.000
You know, you've helped a lot of our dreams come true over these 15 years, so this is

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.000
definitely a celebration that we share with many folks out there and you're a part of

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.000
that all here at OLR, so a happy 15 to you as well.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Oh, I'm a little past that, but actually, 2018 will mark the 10 year anniversary of

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
YYR Games, so there's that.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Oh wow, okay, cool.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Was Snake 360, was that your first game in 2008?

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Yes.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Oh wow, okay, gosh.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
That was my first modern published game, yes.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Wow, alright, alright, cool.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:14.000
So you mentioned you're working on something right this moment that you're getting ready

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000
to show at Too Many Games.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Is that something I can prod you on or is that all still a secret?

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Oh no, no, I'm actually announcing it here.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:25.000
I mean, basically I put the page up on the website on Friday and I just uploaded the

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
screenshots now.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:32.000
I'm going to go ahead and stick a video link in chat.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:42.000
I know that makes for great radio, but basically if you want to go ahead and take a quick look

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.000
at that.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Alright, let's do it.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Basically what, the thing that I'm releasing first, in fact this is going to be coming

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:53.000
out probably in the next one to two weeks, is something I call Falling Plus.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Falling was my love letter to 80s, like early to mid 80s single screen action puzzle games.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Think things like, you know, Mr. Do and Qbert, you know, that kind of thing.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Yeah, I kind of thought that, I remember when you released Falling on XNA, the 360 thing,

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.000
I kind of thought it was a little bit underappreciated, actually.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Well, to be honest, I think there are probably more people that listen to OLR than bought

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
the game.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Which means not many.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:31.000
But I felt that the game deserved another chance, so I went and I sharpened the graphics

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.000
and I fixed a couple of bugs, one of which was pretty embarrassing.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000
I'll be posting a video about that in the coming days.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:44.000
I fixed a couple of glitches, I added a couple of bonus modes.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Basically, you know, for those that missed it the first time, it's a game where basically

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:55.000
you play the part of Peppy the penguin and you're in your igloo, you're just hanging

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:01.000
out, and all of a sudden blocks of ice start falling from the ceiling and Wally the walrus

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
is breaking in too.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:09.000
You have to throw or kick blocks into each other of the same color.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:14.000
And you have to do this while avoiding or crushing Wally before he causes even more

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
trouble.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:24.000
And yeah, it's a relatively simple concept and I hope more people will enjoy it the second

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000
time around.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:31.000
I'm going to be posting it on itch.io and I'm planning to release it for both PC and

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Mac, which is pretty cool because I've never released anything on Mac before.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Fun.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000
So if you can hear some of the noises in the background, it's a very kind of ambient noise

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000
because the YouTube we've got here is like the attract mode going on on the page.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.000
But it's kind of like, to me it looks like, what's that old, old, old, old game?

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Pingo?

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Is that the name of it?

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Where you had the little penguin that pushed the ice blocks together?

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Okay, so it's like...

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000
They play popcorn.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Yes, they play popcorn.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:01.000
It's like that meets, I don't know, maybe like Puyo Puyo?

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Kind of?

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000
A little bit?

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Like I know...

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Maybe kind of a little bit, yeah.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Yeah, this might kind of pain you to hear all these comparisons and so forth.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
But one of my favorite games of all time is Pingo.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000
So you know what?

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000
I think it's...

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Ah.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Yeah.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Well, yeah, it's...

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Oh, and by the way, all those sound effects were created on a Commodore 64 if you were

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.000
wondering.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Yes.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Perfect.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.000
So awesome.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Congrats on that.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000
That'll be...

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000
I'm glad you're giving that game a second chance.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Let us know when it hits the store so we can link people.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Yeah, I'll be tweeting about it, most likely.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:41.680
Oh, and MonoGame, which is the open source replacement for XNA, it made this really super

01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:42.680
simple.

01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:47.000
I ported it to MonoGame on Friday, and I ported it to Mac on Saturday.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Like, it was literally just a one-day thing, and most of that was installing stuff.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
That's awesome.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
That's a lot of stuff.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:02.000
So, I'm looking forward to releasing my first game on Mac, and I believe my planned price

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
is $1.49.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:09.000
So, even if your diet consists of ramen noodles, you might be able to afford it.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:17.000
That's a great price for a clearly 80s classic infused arcade game that you can totally imagine

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
at an arcade back in the day.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Just not an arcade game that drove Jamie Bonkers.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000
This would be one of the games she might have actually played.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Well, we can only hope.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Mayhap.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Mayhap.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.000
And it'll run on her Mac.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.000
And it'll run on her Mac.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.000
But no Linux version?

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.000
I mean, because I was thinking Penguin, you know.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000
You know, it's funny.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:41.000
I figured Jamie would give me shit if I didn't have a Mac version, but I did not expect you

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
to give me shit for not having a Linux version.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000
I mean, I don't care.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
I associate Penguins with Linux.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:51.000
We here at OLR are obliged to give you shit, no matter how many of our dreams you make

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000
come true.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.000
No, I don't want to give him shit, because then that just opens in for shit, well, what

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000
games have you released?

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.000
I wanted to run on an Atari 800.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Look, don't listen to them.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.000
I think it's great that you're getting this out there, and hopefully people will check

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000
it out.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Brandon, I will say this much, and if there was anyone listening who was hoping for a

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Linux version, really the reason that I'm not producing one is because I have nothing

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000
to test it on.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000
You know what?

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
I won't release something I haven't tested.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Pull the fucking Capcom card and say, you know, if this one sells well, I'll think about

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000
doing it on Linux.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Although, let me make a suggestion.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:33.000
If you do want to try an easy-to-use build of Linux, install Linux Mint on a flash drive.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Oh.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:40.000
And then, because you can make, there's an application called Unet Booten that, if you

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:45.000
download Linux Mint, you can use that to put a bootable version of Linux on a flash drive.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:51.000
I've met a couple of people who have survived hard drive failures using that before they

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
could afford new computers.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Interesting.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000
All right, good to know.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
A little Linux tip from Jamie.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
I took it down, thank you.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:04.000
So, I have to bug you a little bit about some of your other games, because you know I'm

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000
curious about multitasking and how that's coming along.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Well, falling plus is the appetizer, really.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Super multitasking is the main course.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Ah.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:17.000
So, it will now actually be called super multitasking, because, well, you know, first you have to

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
do the original, then super, then ultra.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Right.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000
So, I mean, obviously.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Obviously.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.000
And I'm going to go ahead and link another video in chat now.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Basically, I mean, this is not a trailer yet, but, and I hope to have a trailer soon, but

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:40.000
this is going to show you some of the improved graphics.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:44.000
If you're going to run that live, don't do so for more than a minute, because I'm talking

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
at the end.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:54.000
So, basically what you're getting with super multitasking over the original is vastly improved

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000
graphics.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:01.000
I sat down with Amy, and we went through every game, and she, being an artist, she looked

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:04.000
at it, and she said, well, okay, this sucks, and that sucks, and that sucks.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:12.000
And at first I gave her a big frowny face, but then I listened to her suggestions, and

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.000
as a result, it looks a lot better.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Oh my god, I see some of the new things you put in here, too.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
You have a flappy bird thing in here.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.000
I don't remember that from before.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Oh, that's one of the new minigames.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000
I went from 13 to 17 minigames.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Five of those are new.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:35.000
I actually cut one of the original ones, and they're in total, because some of the games

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:40.000
are different when they're running in different slots, there are 27 possible different games

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.000
total that you can be playing, keeping that in mind.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Again, for those of you that missed it the first time, multitasking is a game where you

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:58.000
have to play up to four continuously shuffling minigames at the same time using every part

01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.000
of your controller.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.000
This looks awesome.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.000
It's so simple, but it's so complicated.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Oh my god, some of these new games you've put in there are something else.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.000
The spike ball is evil, because you have to actually dodge in all four directions rather

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000
than just left or right or up and down, so it's very difficult.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Wow, you have a throwback to one of your old games in here, too.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
The shooting gallery game shows up in here.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
You reused your assets, that's great.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Hey, I can't sue myself, so why not?

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:35.000
So basically, again, I know game designers hate to hear their stuff compared to other things,

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000
but the best way I can describe it is that it's like, imagine you have four Game Boy

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.000
advances all playing WarioWare at the same time.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.000
I have been told it's WarioWare on crack.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.000
That is an actual line that I had from someone who played it at a convention.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.000
But that's appropriate, and it's not, I mean, WarioWare is a freaking great game.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000
And to be fair, one we haven't seen from Nintendo in a while, either.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000
That's another game.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.000
I should have put that on my predictions, actually.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
That would be a great one to see show up again at E3.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000
But anyway, hopefully you beat them to it with multitasking.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Well, you know what, if they continue WarioWare, and they should,

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.000
I would hope that they would continue it in the way that they've been doing

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
and focus on what they do well.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:21.000
But I'll run with this ball and take it a little bit further.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000
And speaking of taking it further, so the challenge mode,

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000
I don't know if you guys remember the challenge mode.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.000
So there's the standard mode where you just last as long as possible

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:34.000
and it progressively gets more and more difficult.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:38.000
But also there's a challenge mode where you have scripted challenges

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.000
where it's the same every time, and it's specific setups that were

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
basically designed to infuriate you.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Yay!

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.000
That's been expanded from 30 to 42 challenges, 12 all new,

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.000
and a few subtle changes made to the existing ones.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:01.000
And the last five of them I'm probably creating over the next few days,

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
but they're already planned.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.000
And then, and hopefully the streamers are going to love this one,

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
I've added a mode called Challenge Speedrun, which is basically

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:15.000
it tasks you with completing the entire challenge mode in one sitting,

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.000
complete with a little count-up timer in the lower right corner,

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:23.000
and it does the speedrun work for you.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Interesting. I'm glad you kind of developed it with that in mind.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Yeah, and this is basically, I want to see people post times

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.000
that are just unfathomable on this.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Be careful what you wish for.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Somebody's going to figure out how to break your game,

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
because that's how speedrunners do it.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
They're going to break the damn game to get it done.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Hey, that's good. That's good.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Please break my game so I can fix it.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Alright, so you know what question I've got to prod you with.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Do we have a release date yet, or what?

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.000
I'm planning this summer, alright?

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Probably late summer.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
I'm feverishly working.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.000
My to-do list is down to one page.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Basically what I'm going to be adding in the next week or two,

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
because I need this ahead of the convention,

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:15.000
is when you lose, it's not just going to put a big old game over in your face,

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
but it's actually going to give you tips,

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000
either depending on how far you got,

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
how to play the minigame that you failed,

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.000
or if you got further, how to better multitask the game that you failed.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.000
I want people to understand that, yes, it's hard,

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:34.000
but I want to encourage them to keep trying and to do better.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Well, I look forward to playing this myself

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.000
and being able to stream this game at some point this summer.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.000
You know what's funny? I don't remember if I brought this up before.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:50.000
There was a game on Xbox indie games I played that had you do multitasking.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
I don't remember what it was called.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.000
It was where you had to play a space shooter game,

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.000
and you had to listen to your girlfriend talk to you,

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.000
and you had to repeat back what she was saying.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
That was the funniest part about it.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Then you get a quiz.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Yeah, you do get a quiz.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:11.000
She's talking to you, and you're trying to play the shmup,

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
and then you're like, okay, what did I just say?

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.000
It's like, uh...

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:19.000
That's pretty awesome. That's a good idea for a game. I like that.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
If anyone can remember what that's called,

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
I feel like I need to check that out.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
I don't remember. It's like some weird distraction.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Super nag.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
It may have been something like that.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Ridiculous, yeah.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:36.000
One more thing I'll throw in about super multitasking.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:40.000
I plan to take full advantage of the Steam support.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:44.000
I haven't actually done any of this yet, but I've planned it.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.000
I want to go full bore.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Steam cloud saves, leaderboards for every possible difficulty combination

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.000
in bonus mode and the challenge speed run,

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:59.000
a full set of achievements that reward experimentation as well as achievement,

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.000
and a set of Steam trading cards depicting all of the different ways

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:06.000
that Mr. Multitasking can die.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.000
It sounds like a lofty project, and I wish you luck, my friend.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:13.000
I've been begging you to finish this game for a while,

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:16.000
and of course I know you have your own life to live,

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.000
and you don't make all your money off these games,

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
but I'm really excited for it.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
It's a labor of love.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000
It's priced that way, too.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000
I'm looking at probably somewhere in the $3 to $5 range.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
That's honestly a steal.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:35.000
And also, because these games live and die by word of mouth,

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
I don't know if this is possible.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.000
I'm going to ask Valve if I can't find anything about it,

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000
but what I'm hoping for is that I can do this.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.000
For the first few weeks of release, I'm planning when you buy the game,

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.000
you will get a second giftable copy of it for free,

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.000
and then you're encouraged to give that to your friends, to your enemies,

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
your favorite streamer, anybody.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.000
I've seen them do those two packs before for other games,

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
so it's got to be possible.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:06.000
You may have to price a two-pack at $5 or something

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.000
or make it super-attractable type of price.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:12.000
I'd price it the same as the single and then just offer it for a limited time.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Exactly.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.000
I think that's what they did with stuff that, again,

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
really encourages the multiplayer stuff, like Gauntlet or something.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.000
There was something I bought four copies of,

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
and I gave it to a bunch of people I knew.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Gauntlet, maybe? They had Gauntlet.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
It might have been Gauntlet or something.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
I thought it was Terraria.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
It was Terraria. Thank you. You're right.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.000
It was Terraria because they were selling the four-pack super-cheap,

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
and I think I gave you one, I gave Shane one,

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000
so they gave a bunch of people Terraria at one point, yeah.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
And, yeah.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Well, congratulations in advance.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
I'm really looking forward to seeing you super multitasking,

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.000
and I know you're going to have a bunch of fun at the conventions and so forth.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.000
So, falling plus on itch.io is going to be first in the next few weeks, right?

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Yes. Basically, I want to be able to sell that at the convention

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.000
because due to the nature of Xbox Live Indie games,

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
the fact that you can't generate extra keys,

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:10.000
basically you can't sell it outside of Xbox.com or the console itself.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Basically, for the first time, I want there to be something

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.000
that I can actually sell at the convention.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Nice.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.000
So, that's why I would be trying to release it over the next couple of weeks,

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:24.000
and then super multitasking right behind.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Well, if I maybe bat my eyelashes and wink enough,

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:31.000
maybe you'll hook me up and I can do a stream of that after OLR,

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
like the Sunday before it's out or something, a little sneak peek.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.000
You know what? If I have that capability, you definitely will have it.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Thank you. I really appreciate that. That'll be awesome.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.000
All right. Well, YYR, I do have to get back to the rest of what we're doing on our show,

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:45.000
but I got asked if there's anything else you want to mention

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:48.000
about what's going on in your world or anything with the gaming

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.000
or what types of games you've been playing or anything?

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Nah. Well, I haven't been playing much, but we found BoxBoy on 3DS recently,

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.000
and it's great if you're still on your 3DS. I definitely recommend it.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Didn't they just do the third in that series that just came out?

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Yeah, and they released a demo, which is a really good sampling of the series,

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
so I would definitely recommend that.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:15.000
On mobile, I'm also playing a game called CATS, C-A-T-S.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.000
I think it stands for Crash Arena Turbo Stars. It's by Zeptolab.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.000
I was like, did you really just have to tell us how to spell CATS?

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Okay, I get it. It's like an acronym.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Yeah, it's an acronym, not the name.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.000
And basically, it's BattleBots.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.000
It's basically BattleBots, and you create your own bot,

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
and you put it up against other players' bots.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.000
And the fights all happen within three seconds.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Yeah, it's a fun time waster.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Oh yes, I have seen that. I saw a little trailer of that.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:51.000
It was one of the ads I had the watch or whatever in my little clicker game thing,

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
but it looked pretty fun.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:57.000
It is pretty fun, and it's not a game that you're going to have to spend any money on.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.000
That's good.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:02.000
It's really just to speed up things that are inconsequential.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Otherwise, it's just something you'll go back to a few times a day and have a little fun with.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
I definitely recommend that.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Alright, I definitely need something to replace that fucking Magikarp game,

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.000
so I'm going to check that out right now,

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000
because anything that gets me away from fucking Magikarp,

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:23.000
even though I just finally, finally on my 18th generation,

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
caught a gold one.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Yay!

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
I haven't played it yet.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Stay away. You'll thank me later.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Anyway.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Yeah, I'll just mention one other thing.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000
I know I'm very busy, obviously,

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
but I would like to...

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:44.000
because everyone at work, everyone I talk to,

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:47.000
and every time I do some sort of crazy voice,

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000
they say,

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Oh, are you doing any voiceovers?

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Do you do any voiceovers?

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Do you do any voice acting?

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
People keep asking me this, and well,

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.000
I figured maybe I'll dip my toes in that pool a little bit.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000
So, coming soon,

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
cheapvoiceacting.com.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
This is a venture that you're going into here

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
to do voice acting on the side?

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Yeah, just on the side.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:14.000
I'm not going to intend to replace any professional voice actor,

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
or, you know, whatever,

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:19.000
but I figure if there's an indie developer

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:22.000
who doesn't have, you know, a $20,000 budget,

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
and wants a little voice acting in their game,

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
they can send 50 bucks my way,

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
and I can send them back some speech, that kind of thing.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
I feel like that's a business venture I should get in on too,

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
because that's something I could do on the side too,

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.000
so maybe if...

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Just be careful dealing with the voice actors guild.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.000
This would be...

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.000
It sounds like the way YYR is putting it,

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.000
it'd be for indie developers,

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
it's not going to be for something like EA.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
I would be very forthcoming in saying,

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:49.000
this is not a replacement for a professional voice actor.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
This is if you can't afford those things,

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
and just want to, you know,

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
get by with what I've got.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Indie focused, very different.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Exactly.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.000
You know, I'm not going to pretend to be a professional.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Also, it's not going to be a very fast turnaround either, so...

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Alright.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:11.000
And if anybody happens to be in the Philadelphia area,

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Too Many Games is June 23rd through 25th.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
It's $50 for the whole weekend,

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.000
and if you manage to beat my challenge speedrun in an hour,

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000
I'll give you 100 bucks.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Wow.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.000
How else am I going to get people to test the challenge mode?

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.000
You better make sure it's a one-time only thing,

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.000
just because you might get some crazy people to figure out how to crack the code,

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
and then you're paying out a lot of money, so...

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
One try per day, that'll be the only restriction.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000
There you go, awesome.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Alright, YYR, best of luck to you,

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:43.000
and we'll let everybody know when Falling Plus comes out,

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
and then Super Multitasking after that.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Thanks very much for having me on,

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.000
and hey, keep doing what you're doing.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Sounds good, will do.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
You do the same.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
I plan to.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Take care, guys.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Take care, my friend.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Yep, buh-bye.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Alright, always good to catch up with YYR,

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.000
and the man who's made many OLR dreams come alive,

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.000
and crushed a few, too.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:06.000
No, I'm just kidding.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Mostly the good stuff.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Mostly the good stuff.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Anyway, we're going to take your calls a little later on in the show,

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000
over at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype,

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
but first, we've got some more news we've got to get through.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
We've got to get to emails and all that good stuff,

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.000
so we're going to start with some rapid-fire news going to Loki.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Alright, so Overwatch is getting some updates soon.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:30.000
They're going to be doing some balancing with McCree Reaper and Roadhog.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:37.000
So with McCree, they're going to be tweaking basically his Deadeye Ultimate,

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:42.000
dropping the lock-on time to 0.2 seconds instead of 0.8.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Also, they're going to be increasing the damage from 20 to 80 over the first second.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:54.000
For Roadhog, they're going to be reducing the size of the hitbox of his head,

01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:01.000
and they're also going to be dropping the damage of his gun by 33%,

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.000
but his rate of fire is going to increase by 30%.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Mainly they're saying that's to stop his hook-scrap-gun combo,

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:12.000
which I did find that's pretty strong.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
I killed a lot of things that way.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:21.000
And then, of course, they're saying also that they're going to be adding the Oni Genji

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
and Officer D.Va legendary skins.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:28.000
They were originally exclusive to the Heroes of the Storm boxes that they had,

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.000
but now those are going to be introduced to the standard loot boxes,

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.000
so you can get those if you missed out on them during that event.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Yeah.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:42.000
And then, of course, they were also showing off the Horizon Lunar Collie assault map,

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:46.000
which is going to be a new map that's hitting test servers as well.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:50.000
And then, of course, LEGO Dimensions is still going incredibly strong.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:54.000
They have some new properties that are going to be coming in September.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:59.000
So on September 12th, you can see new sets based off the Powerpuff Girls,

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Teen Titans Go! and Beetlejuice.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Ooh, Beetlejuice.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
A LEGO Beetlejuice looks pretty cool.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Don't say it again.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.000
LEGO Beetlejuice.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Ah, no, he's summoned.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
So it's pretty awesome.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:16.000
So the Teen Titans Go! stuff, I'm not sure who these characters are.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
I mean, it looks kind of neat.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:22.000
And then, of course, the Powerpuff Girls and the Beetlejuice one is pretty cool.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:28.000
They've got Beetlejuice and a sand worm, so those are pretty cool.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
I kind of want that.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
But, yeah, September 12th.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:37.000
I kind of want to get LEGO Dimensions, but, dude, it's that fucking LEGO price point, man.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000
That is so expensive for those things.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Otherwise, I'd probably buy them all.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:47.000
But it's LEGO pricing, and so I can't afford to buy them all.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:51.000
All right, well, let's move on to talk about the E3 event.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:55.000
And Sony is doing something that they've done for the past couple years,

01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:01.000
where they are doing a big Sony broadcast around not just, of course, on Twitch

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:05.000
and the stuff that you can watch at home, but in theaters across the U.S. and Canada.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Apparently, over 85 theaters are being in this event.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.000
And they've done this before, so it's not like it's new.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:16.000
But when they've done it before, they sometimes have some little Sony trinkets

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
that they give away in giveaway bags and all that,

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
and you get to see these trailers on the big screen,

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
which is really worth it for a lot of people as well.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.000
So the PlayStation E3 experience is returning for 2017.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:30.000
I do know the tickets already went up, I think on May 30th.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:35.000
They went through a new vendor called GoFobo, which I'd never heard of before.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
And apparently, it didn't go well.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:42.000
I heard a lot of talk on Twitter about it's not so great.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:46.000
I didn't try for it, because I think the timing doesn't work out,

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
because I still have to work on Monday.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:52.000
And in years past, the closest place to San Francisco anyway, I can't get to it.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Yeah, it was like Pleasanton or something like that.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.000
That's fine. I'll watch it on my TV at Omis. I always have.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
But for those that want the theater experience,

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.000
sometimes feeding off that crowd energy kind of gets people even more amped up.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
So cool.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:10.000
I know where it'd be really cool to feed off that crowd energy and watch it.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Is PlayStation home?

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Maybe that'll come back in VR. You never know.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
That would be cool. I'd be down.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Well, one of the things I think that got spoiled ahead of E3

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:26.000
is the full Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite roster.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Again, of course, they've done a reveal trailer so far,

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:35.000
but some of the fighters in this game have already been leaked out there.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Apparently there are 27 of them. I'm not going to read the entire list here,

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:42.000
because, again, we don't know anything until really Capcom confirms it.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:47.000
But it does sound like the X-Men are out, as we probably anticipated,

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:52.000
and some of the more deep cuts with Capcom are apparently out as well.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:57.000
For example, the beautiful Joe is not there.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Phoenix Wright is not there, but Monster Hunter is.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:05.000
With a lot of those things, what they're trying to do with this is

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
they're going to go the multi-season route with it,

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:12.000
so they're going to put out certain characters for DLC now,

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:17.000
and then they're going to do a second season where they may add some more of these other characters.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.000
I kind of wish they were all available from the get-go,

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:24.000
but I understand that they want to do balancing stuff.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:28.000
It all seems like a lot of it's just the Marvel Cinematic stuff

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
based on the characters that they have available.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Yeah. So, there it is.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:36.000
The whole Marvel vs. Capcom list is floating around out there.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
I'm sure some of you guys have already seen it again.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:43.000
I'm not going to read the whole thing, but it's a very fair sampling of

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:47.000
what's been going on in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as of late as well.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
In fact, for better or for worse.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:52.000
But some people really not happy about the lack of X-Men characters,

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:56.000
but I kind of thought that was already going to be a given about this game.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
We kind of knew that going into this.

01:59:58.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Yeah, I kind of figured it would be.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
So, I'm not sure why suddenly people are surprised.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Maybe they were hoping for a last-minute thing.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Hoping for Deadpool again.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Yeah, maybe.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
All right, moving on. Dark Sakura.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Well, in other news, we have Dickinson Setsu some news.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Basically, there's something been teased that's new for the series.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:25.000
It was said by Masaru Oyamada, who had a few things to say about it

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:28.000
in his interview with Famitsu.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Especially that they'd like to make sure that the old Snake and Densetsu games

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:37.000
can be appreciated by younger players.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:43.000
And looking at graphic uprising from what I can see on here.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:49.000
And he wants to take the opportunity to announce a new development

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:53.000
around the 25th anniversary of the series.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:56.000
So, who knows? We maybe see something else.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Also, Legendary Pokemon and PvP are coming to Pokemon GO this summer.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:08.000
So, basically, you can finally have your on-the-spot dueling

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:14.000
and Legendary so that you don't have to crash actual Pokemon Center events.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:19.000
You can just follow the news from Niantic and that's it.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
You just crash their servers instead.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Right.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:23.000
All the people playing.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Who needs servers anyway? Just crash them all.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:28.000
I'm curious to see how they're going to do that.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Because one of the things I know they quoted on there is

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:35.000
they've learned a lot about the social interaction stuff with Ingress.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:38.000
And I'm curious to see how they're going to integrate that with Pokemon.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Because, to be honest, right now there is no game.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:42.000
It's collecting for me.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
No competitive game.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Yeah, I really want to see what happens with the whole gym.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:50.000
You see, with these gyms, you're going to make these links from one gym to the next.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.000
No, no, no, no.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
But even when it comes to Ingress, I'm like,

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:58.000
yeah, the community stuff is still cool.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
And it's nice that they're bringing back some of the live events.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
And I can probably get into some of those.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:06.000
But the day-to-day stuff is kind of just over it.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:14.000
It'll be nice when there's a 2.0 to shake things up and make things feel fresh again.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:17.000
And I think I can say the same thing about Pokemon is that

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:22.000
when you re-up the gym game and have more of a point to the collecting and all that stuff,

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
there will be that.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
So, anyway.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Alright, let's move on.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Let's move on.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:34.000
We're going to travel around the world and check out what is in stores this week as far as releases go.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Loki, how about the US?

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Yes, we do have a few things coming out this week.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
So, starting off with Cloudone Returns.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
This is Sengoku.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:45.000
That's going to be on PC, PlayStation 4, and the Vita.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:48.000
We have Dark Rose Valkyrie on PlayStation 4.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Dirt 4 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Farming Simulator 18 on 3DS and the Vita.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Farting Simulator. No.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
No, not Farting Simulator.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Farting Simulator 18, I'm sure, is already on Steam.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
I'm pretty sure that's already a thing.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Guardians of the Galaxy, the Telltale series.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Episode 2, Under Pressure, is going to be coming out this week on PC, Mac, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, iOS, and Android.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.000
This is pretty interesting.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Wipeout Omega Collection on PlayStation 4.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:27.000
And finally, Super Beat Zonic on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.000
If you add a Z, it makes it edgier.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:33.000
It's not a Z. It's an X, actually.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Oh, that makes it any edgier.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:44.000
All right, we're going to travel over to Japan and check out what's coming out for those release dates on the...

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
What is the big day for releases there?

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:49.000
I think the 9th is the next big release day.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Although I'm not really seeing anything in Japan on the 9th.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Do we not have anything big coming out on the PlayStation 4 in Japan?

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Maybe not. At least not on the PS4 this week.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Yeah, the next big thing I see is Stormblood for Final Fantasy XIV on the 20th.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:07.000
But I'm not really seeing anything in Japan at least earlier in the month.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Let me see if there's something on Nintendo that might be the reason why.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:17.000
No, the Alliance Alive is out on June the 22nd in Japan on the 3DS.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:21.000
And on the Switch, Arms is out on June 16th.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:25.000
But it doesn't look like we have anything out a little earlier here.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
I'm not sure if there's any...

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Oh, I tell you what. We have a Vita game.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
We have a lone Vita game on June the 8th.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Shiro to Kuro no Alice is out in regular and limited edition.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.000
A lone game.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
The game system that Sony has forgotten about.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:40.000
Not there.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Only one that's getting games.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Not there.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
It's much different in Japan than it is here.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:49.000
You take your Xbox One racks here and replace them with the Vita.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:52.000
That's basically what Japan is a little more like.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:55.000
I don't know if there's a cultural reason.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:58.000
When's the school year there?

02:04:58.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Year round?

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:00.000
It's year round.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
So it's not even like a finals thing or anything.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:06.000
There's like a summer break but school pretty much is year round.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Interesting.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Maybe because of E3. I don't know.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Anyway, how about the UK?

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:15.000
On the 7th we have Wipeout Omega Collection for PS4.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:21.000
And then on the 8th, Dirt 4 for PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
That's it.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Alright. Let's head on over to the mailbag.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Wait. There's a game coming out in the next week but I think the name is funny.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:32.000
What?

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
It's Pixel Heroes Bite and Magic.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
As in Might and Magic.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:37.000
That's cute.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Alright. Let's go to the mailbag.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Every week you guys email us.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com and you can participate with the show.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:57.000
Alright. This email comes from Tiger Tooth.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:03.000
Hello. Actually we have two emails from him but I will read them both because one of them is super short.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Hello OLR. I'm a long time listener. First time emailer.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Yay! Level up.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:13.000
I believe I first started listening to your show when I was in 8th grade.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:16.000
And I'm now about to graduate from high school.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
And now I'm retiring.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:19.000
I feel old.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:27.000
During my first week of high school my history teacher had us make time capsule letters so that we wouldn't get back until the end of our senior year.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:34.000
The time capsule letters were a series of questions that we could write honest responses to because no one but ourselves were supposed to see them.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Well with final exams and graduation around the corner he gave them back to us.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:43.000
And reading through it astonished how bad my spelling was laughing at the jokes I threw in it.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
When suddenly I see an OLR reference.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:49.000
The question was I dislike blank because blank.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:54.000
And my obscure ass put I dislike Britney Spears because I think she is a skank.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
And ORL is what it said.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:04.000
I chuckled to myself after reading this and suddenly found myself at a loss for where this came from.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Obviously it's an OLR reference but who and why said it?

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:12.000
I feel like it was Dark Sakura but I could totally see Rob saying this too.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
Okay okay okay okay.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:19.000
This show is so old I don't remember things that happened on this show three weeks ago.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:30.000
If I didn't have Dark Tetsuya and some of the other long time OLR listeners like Misty and folks and the Wiki and all that I wouldn't know what happened on this show a year ago and so forth.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:34.000
So I think that's hilarious that you wrote a note that kind of came back.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:42.000
One thing I do recall though is let's not forget Britney Spears went through her whole little meltdown phase around that time before Blackout came out.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:45.000
And I think there were probably a lot of people saying that sort of thing about her.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:52.000
But you know what? My opinion on her will say has evolved a lot because she's an awesome ally. Did you see that letter that she wrote?

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:57.000
She hand wrote for her LGBT fans on June 1st to get off Pride Month and I thought that was awesome.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:01.000
And so like you know all Britney wants to do is raise her kids.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:05.000
And she can afford wigs and weave.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:08.000
I do seem to recall we had a conversation like this before.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:11.000
I don't even know if it was on this show or another show but I want to say you said something like

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:17.000
All Britney Spears wants to do is live in a trailer in the back part of Alabama or wherever she's from.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Louisiana.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
Louisiana and raise her kids.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Like she didn't want all this celebrity stuff it just kind of happened to her.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:33.000
And I kind of I tend to agree with that that she does all this stuff and does the lip syncs on stage to music that's really really produced and all this stuff because she wants to make a good life for her kids.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:37.000
So you know what? I got no reason to hate on Britney Spears anymore.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:40.000
And I'm sorry if I ever said anything to hurt her feelings.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Besides that Derek Barry can do it for her.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:47.000
I don't think Loki would have an opinion on the matter but who knows.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Also how did the subject come up lol.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Anyways thought you would like to know that you made it into a capsule letter from some random kid on the other side of the country.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:03.000
That I do get a kick out of even if I have no idea what the heck this is all about.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:07.000
I do love that story so thank you for sharing that.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
That's right we have our time capsule too.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:15.000
We do we do have our time capsule it's waiting for December to come around the holiday episode.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Alright awesome.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Well also did I say I live in Western New York by the way.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
Sincerely Tigertooth.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:29.000
PS sorry if there is any grammar errors.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:33.000
PPS I took a selfie on a teacup when I went to Disney World a month ago.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Bring back Horde House.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Hashtag movement Horde House.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:40.000
I listened to that show from episode 80 until the bitter end.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:43.000
I still think of Pepper Time and Mint and Rob's laugh.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
Whenever I listen to the Spice Girls.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
That was a great in-joke from Horde House.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Sadly it's just one of those things where I think we've all moved on just creatively and we're not really playing MMOs anymore.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:56.000
I know you want it you want the show you can take over Dark Saga.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Okay.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:00.000
When I say we all of course I mean myself, Extover, Shane, and Grandpa.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:05.000
But the cool thing is just about everybody from those days is still podcasting.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:08.000
You can hear Grandpa as Captain Matt on Starboard Power Coupling.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Which is here on VOG.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Shane does Ranger Pride which is here on VOG with Captain Spike.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:19.000
And Extover and I we were doing Guys on a Show.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:23.000
I do not consider that like Pokestop podcast is done.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Like that that show is not coming back.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Guys on a Show is still for me on a hiatus and will be back.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:35.000
Just that Extover hasn't really been able to commit to a regular recording schedule.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
That gels with mine. I won't put all the blame on him.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
That gels with my schedule as well.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:42.000
So we just haven't really been able to bring that back.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:47.000
But we do have ideas and like creatively we kind of know what we want to do with that.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:51.000
So I do still strongly feel Guys on a Show will come back at some point.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
And that's pretty much everybody from the Horde House days.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:58.000
But as far as that I mean we all stopped playing Warcraft except for Grandpa.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
I think still dabbles in it.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.000
I've seen him on sometimes.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Yeah but.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:05.000
But I'm pretty much there by myself in good old Danger Squad.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Oh even Captain Spike and Slidekick stopped playing over there?

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.000
I don't really see them that much.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000
That's too bad.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:13.000
But you know.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:17.000
It just kind of it is what it is.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:18.000
You know it didn't.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:24.000
The show never really recovered from the shift away from Warcraft because it just got too broad.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:27.000
So we just weren't able to make it work anymore.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:28.000
So.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:31.000
But I have some good memories and they're all still my friends.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:32.000
So you never know what might happen.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:35.000
There might be a reunion around another topic someday.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:39.000
There's another addendum in the form of another email.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Keep up the awesome work.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:44.000
You guys never fail to entertain me when I'm doing mundane chores.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Are you doing laundry right now?

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:53.000
You guys help get my mind off things during stressful times and you guys are way better than wild background music.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:54.000
LOL.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Sincerely Tiger Tooth.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:58.000
And don't forget to separate your whites and your colors.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Unless you just wash all that shit on cold like I do.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:04.000
But the whites will be whiter if you wash them separately.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:05.000
You know what?

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Whites already too damn white.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
I had to go there.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
All right.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:13.000
Ah.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:14.000
Thank you.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:15.000
Thank you for the emails.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:20.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you wish to send us an email for the future.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:25.000
In the meantime, we have more news to get into starting with Loki.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Yes.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:31.000
So this is kind of unexpected but apparently the Kerbal Space Program.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:37.000
They announced that I guess the game has been acquired by Take Two Interactive.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:38.000
So they're not.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
They're saying that it's not really going to change much.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:48.000
That the squad and the current development team is still here and hard to work on KSP and its future updates.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:53.000
But we are now fortunate enough to do so with the help of an experienced publisher like Take Two.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:13:02.000
And we couldn't be more excited and happy to see our conjoint collaboration or see where our conjoint collaboration will take KSP forward.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.000
So that's pretty awesome.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:08.000
And yeah it is kind of interesting to see how that works out.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Yeah. I don't know. Maybe that means a sequel.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Who knows.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
I have this installed on my computer.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:20.000
I have honestly played it for about five minutes and that's been kind of it.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
But maybe I need to go back.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:23.000
It didn't hold your interest at all.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
I just. I don't know.

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:31.000
I didn't really get too experimental with making ships and stuff.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:34.000
But there's a lot of people that have made pretty crazy things with it.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
It might be something worth checking out.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:40.000
I know I think while I was prepping the show my son saw this and he's like what's that.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
And I'm like I had to explain to him what it was.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:48.000
And he seemed interested. So maybe it might be something that I can think about playing later on.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:52.000
One of my buddies was really into this game and the physics of it were very interesting.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:56.000
I didn't realize that they released it on console but apparently it says it's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
Yeah they put it on PS4 at some point.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
I apologize because I had to step out for just a minute.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:05.000
But with this whole Kerbal Space Program and the Take Two stuff is it like are we gearing up for a sequel.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Are we gearing up for a sequel at E3. Like is this putting all the.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
I don't know.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:13.000
You would think an acquisition like that is setting things up for a sequel.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:14.000
I don't know.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
You would think. I don't know what they're going to do with it.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:17.000
But it's neat.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Well now I hope this is something that's leading into E3.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
And it's Bayonetta 3.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Yes that's right I really want Bayonetta 3 to happen.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:32.000
And you know there was an interview that Source Gaming did with Atsushi Inaba from Platinum Games.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:37.000
And of course they asked you know they're trying to kind of like you know not say confirm Bayonetta 3.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:44.000
But they said if Bayonetta 3 were to ever happen would Bayonetta still be the protagonist or would you try to surprise fans.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:48.000
And the answer was maybe there would be a male Bayonetta.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Male-netta.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Why not.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
It should be called Bayonet.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Why not. I think that would be hilarious.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:01.000
And says I would like to make Bayonetta 3. We're talking within the company even now about what to do.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:05.000
But because we're constantly talking about it that actually makes it really hard to say.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:11.000
If we weren't talking about it we could just say something random or offhand you know but because we're actually talking about it.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:14.000
Of course that's just something that you talk about when you're making a series.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Do you want to keep the same protagonist.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:20.000
There's plenty of precedent for changing protagonists and so that is something we discuss.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Do we want to keep the same one have a different one add new ones.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
But that's certainly not anything I can say for sure at this point.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:29.000
Well that was kind of the run around there at the end there.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
But I love this. I love folks in our chat room here.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Dungeon Buster says boy-netta and Tiger Claw says bro-netta.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
So there's some answers there. Why not. Why not.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:44.000
Whatever they want to do creatively as long as it's as fun as the first two games.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
I would be so about that.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:49.000
So I do hope a Bayonetta 3 is in the works.

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:57.000
I hope the quiet reception to Bayonetta 2 on the Wii U just because the Wii U was the Wii U doesn't ruin our chances.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.000
We'll see though in about a little over a week.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:09.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com use the pass phrase liquid.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
In the meantime, DarkSakura.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Well just leave it to the ratings board to spoil shit for us again.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:23.000
There is a leak from the ratings board that talks about Minecraft story mode season 2.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Well okay technically this was in Australia but hey.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:30.000
It's called Hero in Residence.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:39.000
It was labeled as multi-platform which would match the 11 different device releases that we got with the previous one.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Including the upcoming Switch release.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:45.000
So yeah.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:49.000
Well it's not quite Minecraft 2 like you were saying at the beginning but hey.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:53.000
It is a Minecraft part 2 but it's a little different.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
It's it's own thing I guess.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Story mode is a Telltale game.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
It's just in the Minecraft universe.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
It was alright. I played the first episode and it was okay.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:04.000
I mean it was my first Telltale game which is awesome.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Was it really?

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Well I have, I own a lot of them.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
I just haven't played a lot of them.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Make time to play Walking Dead.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
It's good.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:18.000
I still want to go through Sam and Max and the Back to the Future series.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.000
I even like the Jurassic Park ones.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:24.000
I know a lot of people hated on those but I thought that was fun.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
So whatever.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Of course I don't know.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.000
The Telltale stuff is kind of a throwback to me of the older PC games.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:34.000
For Game of Thrones I know they did a Game of Thrones one didn't they?

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Very interesting.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
But yeah.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:43.000
So one game I forgot to mention that I played during my game week this week was Grand Theft Auto 5.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:47.000
And of course part of that I didn't play was Grand Theft Auto Online.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:50.000
I still have been kind of wary to go back into it because so much has changed.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:55.000
I don't think I'll be able to figure out what to do because there's just so much out there.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:59.000
But one of the things that, one of the comments around that.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:06.000
I guess they had a, I want to say their financial meeting or something like that.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:09.000
But Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:17.000
He had spoken to I guess GameStop regarding his stance on microtransactions and how they relate to Grand Theft Auto Online.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:25.000
And basically saying you know, you can't give stuff away for free in perpetual, or perpetuality.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:30.000
There's no business model in that which you know basically that makes sense.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:38.000
We're convinced that we are probably from an industry view under monetizing on a per user basis.

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:43.000
But we're not trying to optimize the monetization of everything.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:50.000
We do to the nth degree. My concern is if you do that, the consumer knows.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:54.000
They might not even know that, or they may not even know that they know.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
But they feel it.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:59.000
There is wood to chop because I think we can do more.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:03.000
I think we can do more without interfering with our business strategy.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:08.000
And being the most creative about our ethical approach which is delighting consumers.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:11.000
We're not going to grab the last nickel.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:15.000
It's respectable. They do give out a lot of content for free.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:18.000
However, there's a lot of stuff that is revolving.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:23.000
I mean this is back from when I played Grand Theft Auto Online quite a bit several years ago.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:28.000
There is a lot that goes around money in the game.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:31.000
Like they used to have it where you have to buy insurance for your vehicles.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:35.000
And they get destroyed by another player. You have to pay money to fix your car.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:42.000
You know, unnecessary realities I guess in the game.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:45.000
I mean that's not necessarily a fun thing.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:51.000
But it's just something that's another thing to spend money on in the game.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:54.000
It's been a while since I played it.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:57.000
You just started playing Overwatch, right? This is something they love to do in that.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Well, Overwatch is mostly just skin crap.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:01.000
That's true.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:07.000
And there's a lot of customization stuff you can buy in Grand Theft Auto with the in-game money.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:10.000
But that's all stuff you can earn by doing missions.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
It's as if you don't want to wait to do all that stuff.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:15.000
You can get their shark cards and bypass all that.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:18.000
But they certainly give you a lot of stuff.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:24.000
I feel that for what they put out there for free, the content, there's a lot of it.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:30.000
So I'm not saying that they're pulling the whole free-to-play stunt on it.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:33.000
But I think you get a lot of value for Grand Theft Auto Online.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Plus you have Grand Theft Auto 5, which is a fantastic game altogether.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
And you got that for free basically.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:43.000
I mean I understand where he's saying that there's probably more stuff they can monetize for.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:46.000
But as long as they don't do it in a way that feels cheap.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
And like I said, it's been a while since they played it.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:52.000
So hopefully it seems that a lot of the stuff that's coming out now is more of that,

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
ooh, I really want to have that because that's cool.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:21:01.000
And not, ugh, I got to pay money for a mechanic to stay around every single day and rent for my apartment and all that stuff.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:02.000
And that's kind of lame.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:05.000
But I don't know, we'll see what that's like.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:08.000
But it sounds like, I mean so far it's been alright.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Alright, well one more story for you guys.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
And we're going to open up the Skypline at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:19.000
And this is about a, this is a series that's near and dear to our hearts here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
It's the River City Ransom series.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:26.000
And yep, River City's getting a new game actually coming out in the 3DS eShop.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
River City Knights of Justice.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:33.000
Now here's the thing, this game actually came out in Japan way back April 2014.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
This game originally came out.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:39.000
It is finally coming to North America and Europe this summer.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Well over three years after the fact.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Wow.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:48.000
In Japan this game was called Nekketsu Maho Monogatari on the 3DS eShop.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:49.000
And now we're going to get it.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Yay, it's a 3DS eShop exclusive, meaning there's no retail copy available.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:56.000
This is where Kunio and his friends go medieval.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
So you get heroes and villains.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Yeah, it looks just like Dragon Quest.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:05.000
Yeah, it's kind of like that whole world meets a fantasy game.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:09.000
I'm kind of down with like a River City Ransom game set in like a Dragon Quest universe.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:10.000
That'd be pretty cool.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Magic to bring peace back to Riverandia.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:17.000
Definitely a plot rather than those games, right?

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:20.000
I hope there's something that cures barf.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:25.000
Remember in the NES game you punch the enemies, they go barf.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
That was always the funniest thing when I was younger.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
I don't know, it probably still is funny.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:32.000
Have you ever made your kids play River City Ransom?

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
No, they have never played that.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:37.000
You should have them check it out and see if they laugh when barf comes up on the screen.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
I don't think they know what the word barf means.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:40.000
You should teach them.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:41.000
They actually know.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:42.000
I spent some time with Uncle Rob.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:43.000
Uncle Rob will teach them.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:44.000
They know what throw up means.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
I'm sure it's pretty easy for them.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:47.000
Alright.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Again, River City Knights of Justice.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
It's going to be at E3 actually.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
The Natsume booth will have this.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:54.000
So you can check that out.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:59.000
Or you can watch the various YouTubes of the Japanese version that's already out there if you want to check that out.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Alright, I hope this series finds its way.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:05.000
What do they call all these characters?

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Kunio, is that what it's called?

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:07.000
The whole series?

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:08.000
The Kunio-kun.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:09.000
Kunio-kun, that's it.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:13.000
I hope this series makes its way to Switch one way or another.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Like, you know, I know they did like an All-Stars game on 3DS that like kind of brought the dodgeball and the River City Ransom worlds together.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:27.000
But man, that dodgeball game, that was one of my favorite arcade games they ever did back in the day was that Kunio.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
It was on the Neo Geo, right?

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.000
The dodgeball game?

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:31.000
Wasn't that a Neo Geo?

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Originally, I know they did a version on the NES, but I feel like there was a version in the arcade I played.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
So, Dark Tetsuya agrees with me there.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Yeah, totally need a Switch version of Kunio.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Agree.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Skype line is open!

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:51.000
If you want to give us a call to talk about anything we might have touched on tonight or perhaps we missed it and you want to let us know.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:52.000
You can do that.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:59.000
While we wait to see if anybody takes advantage of that tonight, Loki, let me check in with you.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:00.000
Do you have any last minute stories for us?

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:09.000
Yes, there's been leaks already of stuff that Sony's going to be announcing, including a brand new PlayStation 4 system that's going to be gold colored.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Coming out June 9th, they already have pictures of it.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:13.000
Big deal.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:14.000
Yeah.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:15.000
A gold PS4.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:16.000
What's special about it?

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Is it just...

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:18.000
It's gold.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:19.000
Here's my question.

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Is it a pro?

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
No, it's not.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:23.000
See?

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:24.000
Hmm.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:25.000
I feel like...

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:26.000
God damn it, Sony!

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:29.000
$249 for one terabyte model.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Okay, again, it's rumor, so...

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
It's not rumor, I see a picture of it right here.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:35.000
Oh, so like...

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.000
It's Target or Walmart or something got it and they took a picture of it.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Looks like Walmart based off the price.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:42.000
So...

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
It's not on the internet, so it must be true.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Well, no, I mean, it's a box in a Walmart.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
It's in their case, locked up.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:52.000
So they're planning on doing one of those, it's available today type of things.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Yeah.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Okay.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:55.000
Which, you know, whatever.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:25:00.000
Technically it would be coming out on, before E3, it would be coming out on the 9th, so...

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:01.000
You know.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:02.000
Interesting.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:03.000
But I just...

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:06.000
Isn't it weird that it's not a pro?

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:10.000
So, Sony's kind of already taken a step back from that?

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:11.000
Yeah.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:15.000
That should have been on my list of things I want to see from Sony at E3 is like, give

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:16.000
me more of this pro thing.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:20.000
Because this is, this is really starting to become a pet peeve when it comes to Sony.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:24.000
I am really having trust issues with Sony peripherals.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:27.000
And this is a big reason why I haven't plunked the money down on VR, because I feel really

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:30.000
burned by PlayStation 4 Pro.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:33.000
And, you know, this has happened with the Vita.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
This has happened with the Move.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
This has happened with...

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:40.000
I want to say the PSP, but I suppose that's...

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:43.000
They tried with the PSP a lot longer than other devices to be fair.

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
So I can't really pick on them for that.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
But it seems like as of recent, like Sony really...

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Oh, the TV, the PlayStation TV thing.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
They ran the hell away from that too.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.000
3D.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:58.000
So I'm getting really concerned with how fast Sony is backtracking on these peripherals.

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:01.000
And they do need to be, you know, if we're going to be critical of Nintendo and all this

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:05.000
stuff too, we need to be critical of Sony when they are making missteps too.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
And this is one of them for me.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
This whole backtracking of peripherals.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
I mean, this is just one picture.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:14.000
I mean, they could have a pro model that's available as well.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:15.000
We don't know.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:16.000
That's fair enough.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Right now, I'm assuming they probably don't, or it could be a different color or who knows?

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:21.000
That's fair.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:22.000
They could have it available.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:25.000
But at the very least, we're going to get a different color PlayStation 4 system, which

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:26.000
honestly, it doesn't look that great.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:27.000
It's gold.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:28.000
I mean, it kind of looks cheap.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Yeah, it's one of those things where like that would be cool if I didn't already own

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:32.000
one.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:35.000
But well, maybe with the announcement that they're ending PlayStation 3 production, this

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
is the time to entice people to jump into that.

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:38.000
I don't know.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:44.000
SH2100Matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, feels like Sony has worst kept secret

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:48.000
leak before each E3, but they do somehow keep something to surprise.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:49.000
It's a very minor thing.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Yeah.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:55.000
Well, if that's already on shelves June 9th, then it isn't really an E3 or anything.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:01.000
It's more one of those, they want to get it on shelves because of the hype E3 might build.

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Like there might be something they're going to show that make people go, oh, we need to

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
go out and get a PlayStation 4 because this is going to be on it.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
And so they want it to be on the shelves.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:09.000
That part I kind of get.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
Anyway, we are getting a call on the phone, so I want to get to it.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:13.000
Who's this?

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:14.000
Hey, this is Akdeft.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:15.000
Hey, Akdeft.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:16.000
How you doing?

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Pretty great.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:18.000
Good.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:19.000
What's on your mind, my friend?

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Well, I want to talk about Nintendo and it's voice chat options for the Switch.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:27.000
Please.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:28.000
What's your take?

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:29.000
We talked ad nauseam about it.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
What's your take on it?

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Well, like I said in chat, I do see Loki's point.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:44.000
It seems overly complicated to Nintendo to do this, but at the same time I see some practicality

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:53.000
from it because since the Switch is a portable console and you're not necessarily going to

02:27:53.000 --> 02:28:02.000
be playing on the TV, having your smartphone pretty much everywhere you go is like something

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:08.000
that, okay, you can use this instead of hooking everything up to the console.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:16.000
I see it more like a practical thing, but yeah, Nintendo does seem to overcomplicate things.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:21.000
No, thank you so much, Akdeft, because you reminded me of something big and I really

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:25.000
wish I'd thought of this when Loki and I were debating this earlier, but thank you, thank you, thank you.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
You reminded me of why.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:28.000
You're right.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:33.000
It's the Switch's portability issue and they didn't want to charge more money by putting

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:40.000
a 3G thing in the Switch like the Vita used, lololol, not very well, that whole thing.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:45.000
That's what they're doing to get around data so you can do voice chat when you're on the go

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:50.000
is that by doing it on your phone then the Switch doesn't have to have that component built into it

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
making the system cost more money.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Thank you, Deft, I wish I'd thought of that earlier.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:29:00.000
And to counter that, okay, if it has to be tethered to the phone anyways because it needs to have

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:07.000
data in order to play multiplayer, why still can't the voice chat go through the system and not a separate app?

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:12.000
But technically we still don't know exactly how it's going to work.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:16.000
It may be an option, so maybe.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Well, we'll see. Again, I still feel like debating this is a little early.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
I mean, it doesn't stop the internet from doing it anyway.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:29.000
I know some of y'all Nintendo fans get needled by what Loki says, but he ain't saying nothing that

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:30.000
other people ain't already saying.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Well, here's the thing, I find it was a separate app to do if you want to schedule stuff.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Say you don't have your Switch with you, you're at work doing something and some friend's like,

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:42.000
hey, I want to play a game later and you go, okay, I'm going to schedule something and then you go home

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
and then you can do that and the app works with it.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:45.000
And it's all set up magically, yeah.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:51.000
And that would be fine, but to require you to use your phone for it seems stupid.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:55.000
That's the thing. I don't know, whatever.

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:56.000
They're going to do whatever they're going to do.

02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:01.000
Maybe it's to force people into the app so that becomes commonplace.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:06.000
Because what good is it to go in and schedule something if the other people are like,

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
oh, I don't use that app because I'm not required to.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:09.000
Well, don't build an app then.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
I don't know. We'll see.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:20.000
The thing too, sorry, the thing, it's also that many people use other voice chat apps for voice chat.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:24.000
We see Discord, we see Skype, even Google Hangouts.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:30.000
So I, again, do not see the big issue here or the big problem.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Again, Nintendo's overly complicating things, but at the same time, I see the practicality in it.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:39.000
So that's my take on it.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Well, this is something we're certainly going to revisit in about, in two weeks' time basically,

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:51.000
on the 15-year anniversary episode, when we know what Nintendo's going to say about this whole thing.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:58.000
I mean, there is the very realistic possibility they may not address the whole voice chat thing in their presentation.

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:01.000
However, with the hours and hours of Treehouse that they're doing,

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:07.000
I do expect this topic to come up at some point, especially with Splatoon 2 coming out in July.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
And they do want to sell that game.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:13.000
I feel like Nintendo is going to have to start to peel back.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:17.000
What is this going to look like? Because it's very important for Splatoon 2.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Yes, we know you're going to be able to play online, and it's obviously going to be free now until 2018,

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
because of the delay of Nintendo Online.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:29.000
But what does Splatoon 2 look like six months from now when you're scheduling events and all this stuff?

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:32.000
I do think Nintendo kind of has to answer that question.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:37.000
If it's not in the main presentation, at least maybe a demo during the Treehouse.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:41.000
Because they're going to have so many hours to fill during Treehouse,

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:45.000
and you know they're going to push arms and they're going to push Splatoon 2 during Treehouse.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:50.000
They have to. Those are the big games over the summer that they want people to go out and buy.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Yeah, especially Splatoon 2. That's going to be a really, really big game.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:32:00.000
And it's so funny, because we were talking about this whole arms and esports and all this stuff.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:05.000
And honestly, if anything Nintendo should be esports, it ought to be Splatoon.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Well, they've already asserted that it's going to be with their stupid trailer that showed this big esports arena.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:17.000
They're already playing on their Switch and hunky-dory. I mean, they've already solidified it's going to be esports.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:20.000
I think it could be with Splatoon.

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:27.000
Well, they're going to have their tournament thing, invitational for Splatoon 2.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:30.000
And they're going to have actual Splatoon teams.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:36.000
But to be fair, as critical as Loki's being, and I am being, to a point of this whole thing,

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:39.000
this isn't that different from what Blizzard does.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Blizzard also puts together their own events for their own games.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:46.000
And they're taking it even bigger with this whole Overwatch League thing.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:50.000
So, you can't say this is something unique to Nintendo.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:55.000
Although I do agree there has to be some sort of adoption by the community.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:59.000
But at the same time, also, look what's happening to Street Fighter V.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:04.000
You know, Street Fighter V seemed to be this very logical, like, this is going to be the next big thing.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
And I think it is being adopted to a point.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:12.000
But Street Fighter V is kind of, in some ways, Street Fighter V is kind of, I don't want to say flopped,

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:16.000
but it's not hit that level that you would expect of a Street Fighter franchise game.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:19.000
Yeah, definitely not the same as Street Fighter IV.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Exactly. Now, games can, we live in this very strange day and age now where games can be resurrected.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Like Diablo III, Final Fantasy XIV.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:32.000
Well, look at Street Fighter V. I mean, look at why it didn't take off.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
It's because it was released unfinished.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
Yeah. No, I don't disagree.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:41.000
Let all the publishers realize, hey, if you release your game unfinished, probably not going to be taken too well.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:42.000
I don't disagree with that.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Especially when you're asking for a finished price.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
Yeah, I don't disagree with that.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:50.000
I kind of disagree on that, but eh, yeah, it was unfinished.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:54.000
But the game, when it came out, it worked flawlessly.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:58.000
At least the gameplay itself, it was perfect.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
But yeah, I don't understand the point.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:03.000
Alright. Well, Akdeaf, do you have anything else you want to share?

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:08.000
No, I will call you in two weeks, I think.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Alright, sounds good. Can't wait for it.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:11.000
Alright, take care, my friend.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
Okay, thanks for having me.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
Yeah, anytime. Bye-bye.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:19.000
Alright, we'll see if anybody else wants to sneak in there real quick, otherwise we'll wrap things up.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:26.000
Post-show tonight, I'm going to stream Mario Kart 8, because I've been promising that for like two weeks.

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
And finally, I'm going to do it tonight.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
So hopefully some of y'all will be online to race with me.

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:34.000
I'm not going to set up a formal tournament, because last time I did that, we ran into issues.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:37.000
So this time, I'm just going to see what happens if I do multiplayer.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:42.000
And hopefully there aren't more people that want to play, but we'll see what happens.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:45.000
It's going to be a learning experience, one way or the other.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:50.000
I have a bad feeling we might run into the opposite problem than we do with tournaments, but we'll see.

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:53.000
We're going to have fun, no matter what. We're going to play Mario Kart, we're going to have fun.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:59.000
Yeah, and they also show the, it's in a Target ad too, so it's definitely coming.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:05.000
They're saying it's $50 off for $249.99. They're also selling the controllers separately.

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
Of course they are.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Because the controllers must be separate from the machine you have to use them on.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Well, no. I mean, if you want additional gold controllers, you can buy them separately.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:22.000
So, what's funny is that now that I do have two PlayStation 4 controllers, because a friend gave us one for Christmas, so we have a red controller too,

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:28.000
I find it's really funny, like, I keep one plugged into the PlayStation charging, and then I use the other one,

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:32.000
and then the minute the battery thing starts flashing, I just switch them.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:36.000
I plug the black one in, I take the red one back. It's kind of a nice system.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:44.000
I still can't, and I mentioned this last week, I still can't believe that the Xbox One controllers still take AA batteries.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:50.000
And you have to buy a separate battery pack for that. That is stupid. Especially for the price that they're charging for those controllers.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:55.000
Yeah, maybe that's something that will change a little bit with Scorpio. We'll see. I mean, you would hope with the price you're going to pay for that.

02:35:55.000 --> 02:36:02.000
Yeah, and actually Bobby Blackwell says, I love that they take AA batteries. I love that. I wish more controllers gave that option.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:07.000
I do think a keyword there is option. It would be great if a controller could take both.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Well it can, you just have to buy that battery pack separate though.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:18.000
Of course, of course. Anyhow, since no other calls are coming in, I think we're going to take the hint and go ahead and wrap up.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:26.000
I do want to remind everybody, E3 officially starts in six days with EA, and it's going to be a fun week of leaks and so forth.

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:32.000
There's also, you know, to be fair, Apple's got a big tech thing going, what WWDC is this week.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:38.000
And that could affect mobile gaming as we hear about inevitably iOS 11 and so forth.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:44.000
So it's going to be a crazy week. At least this year it doesn't overlap with E3.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Because that's what usually happens is the Apple thing. That happened one year where Apple's conference was at the exact same time as Nintendo or something.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:56.000
I don't remember what it was, but it was a mess. So thankfully this year there's a little breathing room between them.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
But it's going to be a crazy week into the summer.

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:06.000
But thank you guys for spending your Sundays here with Orange Launch Radio, participating in the spirited debate, but never mean debate.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Because at the end of the day, we all still respect each other's opinions and all that good stuff.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:13.000
And we really appreciate you guys that show up here at Orange Launch Radio live every week.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:21.000
And if you do enjoy what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two to check out the show over at the VOG Network, vognetwork.com.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:26.000
And joining us here live on Sunday nights. Word of mouth goes a real long way.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:34.000
Again, if you can't think of a lot of friends to tell, nice reviews on iTunes or Google Play or wherever it is that you found this show.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:35.000
Five star reviews go a long way.

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
Remember, if you can't use your mouth, use your fingers.

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:41.000
I like that. I do like that. If you can't use your mouth, use your fingers.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
Loki, your final thought?

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:54.000
My final thought is... I don't know. Maybe get some programming.

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
You can do it.

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:59.000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:06.000
Jan, I miss ice cream. I miss carbs. I really want more cheese.

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:15.000
Same issue too. And my final thought tonight is, I can't believe my birthday is this month and I'm turning older.

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:16.000
Rob?

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:21.000
No, I'm not doom and gloom about it, but it's just one of those like, oh gosh.

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:24.000
I like how I didn't need to say anything. I just needed to say Rob.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:30.000
Well, it's not what you said, it's how you said it. Because you said it like, girl.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:31.000
Let me learn you a thing.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:37.000
Exactly. Oh, and I think this is also a very, very, very important thing to put out there and I want to make sure I do say this.

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:46.000
My mom was discharged from the hospital earlier this week after she was in the ICU for six days with her condition.

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:52.000
And she is, thanks to the miracle of drugs, she's doing a lot better.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:55.000
And there are going to be some changes with her lifestyle.

02:38:55.000 --> 02:39:06.000
She is 76 years old after all, but I just really want to take a minute to thank everybody for all the kind things that were said on Twitter and social media and in chat and so on and so on.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:18.000
And she has seen some of that too. I showed her Facebook and all that and she was really, really overwhelmed with all that and really appreciates all that as she is continuing on her path to recovery.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:25.000
So I just want to give a real heartfelt thank you on her behalf and all of you that have been thinking of us. It's really, really, really appreciated.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:34.000
So with that, I think that's a good positive note to end on. So I think we'll end it there and we're going to end the show for this week.

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:39.000
So we'll see you guys next time on Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys so much for being here. We'll see you in seven days.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:45.000
And for those of you that are going to E3, travel safe and have fun.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:49.000
