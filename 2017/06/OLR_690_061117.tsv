7000	14000	These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	This week, the completely expected annual OLR intro has arrived. Ladies and gentlemen, E3 is here!
20000	25000	But you knew that, so stay tuned!
25000	27000	You know how this works.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	46000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, June the 11th of 2017, with episode number 690 of our show.
46000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E.
50000	56000	joined here in Studio N7, based out of Sacramento, California, with my co-host.
56000	61000	Not here just yet, but on her way, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers. She's running a smidge behind tonight.
61000	63000	But joining me here is Techmaster Loki.
63000	64000	Hello.
64000	65000	Hi, Loki. How are you?
65000	66000	I'm fine.
66000	68000	It's been a busy week. Here we are. It's E3 season.
68000	69000	Yeah.
69000	70000	Does it feel weird not being there?
70000	71000	No.
71000	72000	Because we used to go.
72000	77000	I think I went a few more times than you did, but you still went one of those years towards the end, right?
77000	80000	Yeah, it was 2009.
80000	87000	Yeah. So, okay, so that was probably the last time you went. But now you're just, you're enjoying the whole watching-from-home thing and playing the home game, right?
87000	93000	Yeah, I mean, I don't know. There's not really, I don't see the need to go anymore.
93000	102000	Yeah. Yeah, I hear you. There's so much that's delivered through the, you know, Twitch and the now Mixer and the whole, you know, internet route that, you know,
102000	108000	it just seems like you can almost cover more from home because those guys get the appointments so you don't have to, right?
108000	114000	I'm going to be very interested to hear what it's like from the, you know, the fans. I'm using my Quiddie fingers that are actually there this year.
114000	117000	I'll be very interested to see how it goes this year.
117000	126000	All right. I do want to say, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,
126000	131000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
131000	139000	And we will get to your comments and stuff in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
139000	140000	And…
140000	142000	Who uses chat rooms anymore?
142000	144000	Hi, Jamie. How are you?
144000	145000	I'm okay.
145000	146000	You showed up just in the nick of time.
146000	147000	I'm hungry.
147000	150000	I know. I know. So, you've had a busy day. Where are we at? We're doing a…
150000	151000	My hair's dead.
151000	153000	Oh, yeah. Your hair is all purple into blue. It's like…
153000	155000	It's actually two different shades of purple.
155000	157000	Your hair could be a video game logo, but it's not.
157000	158000	I look like a unicorn.
158000	160000	A unicorn frappe. Yes. No, I'm kidding.
160000	163000	Without the stabby forehead accessory.
163000	165000	How do you feel not being at E3 this year? You used to go…
165000	166000	I don't care.
166000	167000	I don't care.
167000	168000	The luster's worn out for you?
168000	170000	Too many fucking people. I just don't care.
170000	171000	Yeah.
171000	175000	You know, I'd rather, if I'm going to go to a big event, I'm going to go to a fun con instead.
175000	177000	Go to a fan run thing?
177000	178000	Yeah. I don't care.
178000	179000	All right.
179000	182000	Other people can do all that shit for me.
182000	187000	I'll get what I want out of it without, you know, pieces of plastic I'm going to throw away five days later.
187000	194000	Over at our chat, over at live.vognetwork.com, we've got Maya who says, hungry for E3 takes.
194000	197000	Yes, I know you guys are. So, let's get to it.
197000	199000	We've got a lot of ground to cover tonight.
199000	204000	And we do have to end right at nine o'clock or a little bit before because we have a press conference at nine.
204000	206000	I thought it was going to be in the middle of the show.
206000	209000	Every other year they've done seven o'clock our time, but this year…
209000	210000	I think they moved it.
210000	211000	We have a reprieve.
211000	213000	Yeah, they bumped it back two hours for whatever.
213000	215000	That's weird because that's midnight on the East Coast.
215000	216000	That's late for those guys.
216000	220000	It's the one time of year where the West Coast gets the advantage for a change.
220000	227000	So, you know what? I'm sorry, East Coast, but you all get all those award shows that are broadcast live and not tape play.
227000	230000	You get all that other stuff that's live and you get Saturday Night Live that's actually live.
230000	232000	You know what? This is the one time where we get something.
232000	234000	So, we're going to take it.
234000	236000	All right. Let's get into it.
236000	240000	E3. So, we had two big press conferences that have already happened.
240000	241000	Let's start with EA.
241000	245000	Admittedly, I did not watch this press conference because it was a terrible time, Saturday afternoon.
245000	250000	I was busy with, ironically, another convention that has nothing to do with video gaming here locally.
250000	253000	But, Loki, I know you watch.
253000	254000	So, tell us a little bit about the EA event.
254000	259000	So, they started off with, and I'm trying to remember because it was, you know…
259000	263000	They had a lot of sports mixed in there, so I kind of tuned out during that stuff.
263000	266000	But they started off, I want to say it was Battlefield 1.
266000	273000	They were showing off the new DLC that they have coming out for that, which looks pretty cool.
273000	278000	So, I mean, that'll be something that will be, I think it's later this summer or the fall.
278000	281000	So, they're showing that.
281000	287000	And then they talked a little bit about how they're going to be doing some esports related stuff with Battlefield.
287000	293000	I'm not sure if it's tied into Battlefield 1 or if they're doing their own esports type game.
294000	295000	Excuse me.
295000	297000	They were talking about making some new maps that were going to be a little bit smaller,
297000	303000	so that maybe catered more towards those types of, that type of gameplay.
303000	306000	And then they showed off, what was it?
306000	310000	They were talking about the, well, at the time it was the Xbox Scorpio.
310000	315000	So, they were showing off some Madden stuff and like, hey, look, you can see the knee pads.
315000	318000	And I was like, don't fucking care.
318000	323000	But apparently, you know, if you really wanted to see up close, you know, the detail of the people.
323000	325000	I mean, the details there.
325000	327000	Sorry, the Google chat noise was the studio computer.
327000	329000	Sorry, guys, I thought I'd turn that off.
329000	330000	But it's not you.
330000	331000	So, they have that.
331000	336000	They showed off a little bit of the Need for Speed pay, I think it was Payback is what it's called.
336000	338000	I don't remember the subtitle there.
338000	343000	The new Need for Speed game that's basically, you know, Fast and the Furious type nonsense.
343000	346000	So, they showed off a little bit of gameplay from that, which, I mean, it looks like,
346000	351000	honestly, to me, it looks like Burnout, just like how they're doing the takedowns of cars and stuff.
351000	354000	Like, that's Burnout, but whatever.
354000	357000	I mean, I'm all down for that, I guess.
357000	362000	They showed NBA Live, which I just kind of tuned out for.
362000	364000	I don't believe they had NHL.
364000	366000	Oh, I do remember they had FIFA.
366000	369000	And for some reason, I don't know why they do this.
369000	371000	Maybe it's because I'm just not a fan of sports games.
371000	375000	But I think each year that they try to present FIFA,
375000	378000	it's awkward and cringey.
378000	379000	Like, it's just weird.
379000	381000	Like, there's one year that they did an interview,
381000	387000	and this year they had presenters, which I think are part of either a football
387000	390000	or, you know, in the FIFA realm here.
390000	392000	And it was just really cheesy.
392000	394000	FIFA is the biggest game in the world.
394000	398000	Well, I understand that, but the way they presented it was really cheesy.
398000	401000	I lost interest very fast with it.
401000	402000	I don't know.
402000	405000	Was last year the year they did that whole, you are the FIFA?
405000	407000	Oh, no, they didn't have that yet.
407000	410000	They had, like, was it some fictional player's name where they say,
410000	413000	oh, yeah, even during the games, people are just wondering what's going on
413000	414000	with this fictional player.
414000	417000	I'm like, I don't fucking care.
417000	419000	Does really anybody do that?
419000	421000	I just don't believe that they would do that.
421000	425000	So that aside, sports, you know, glancing over that stuff aside,
425000	430000	they did show, of course, the big one, which was Star Wars Battlefront II.
430000	432000	And that looks fantastic.
432000	435000	So they showed off, you know, kind of a trailer for it,
435000	439000	kind of it's covering, you know, all three, you know, storylines.
439000	443000	And then, of course, they have their own individual storyline
443000	446000	that's with that as far as like an offline single player and stuff.
446000	450000	And then they actually did demonstration of like an online multiplayer match.
450000	453000	So they had like their first multiplayer teaser and stuff.
453000	456000	And then they showed an actual match being played, which it looks pretty awesome.
456000	458000	I'm a little more interested because they're single player.
458000	461000	I don't know if that's a game I'll get right out the gate during the busy holiday season.
461000	464000	Well, one of the other things that was pretty cool about it is they mentioned,
464000	467000	much like they did with Titanfall, all the DLC for it,
467000	471000	which is they're going to have a whole season of DLC, is going to be free.
471000	473000	So that's pretty nice.
473000	476000	Some comments from our chat over at live.vog.network.com.
476000	480000	DCB Needle Crash in chat says, EA should just give up on NBA Live.
480000	483000	Live hasn't been relevant since the 90s.
483000	486000	And Act F says, Loki, the thing is that what they showed
486000	489000	is something that people that are into those types of games actually like,
489000	492000	which I think is kind of the FIFA stuff being referred to.
492000	495000	Okay, so I get it. I get it.
495000	498000	But like, do they really need to have like an interview with, was it Pele last year?
498000	501000	Do they really need to have an interview that takes up like ten minutes
501000	503000	of a presentation in the middle?
503000	505000	Pele is kind of a legend.
505000	507000	I understand it, but you know what?
507000	510000	When you're talking about a conference where you can show off,
510000	512000	and they did have like games that they're talking about,
512000	514000	like these indie games that they're funding and stuff.
514000	517000	When you have a conference that only has a finite amount of time,
517000	519000	and you waste ten minutes of that interview,
519000	523000	save that for a separate video that you can put out right after the conference.
523000	527000	I sort of follow you because, like not to jump ahead,
527000	531000	but the whole Porsche reveal at the Xbox thing was also kind of one of those
531000	534000	neat but wrong show.
534000	537000	You know, this is E3. We're here to see games, not cars.
537000	541000	You know, and some people would read me up and down for that
541000	543000	because, you know, there's a lot of crossover, but I'm sorry.
543000	548000	To me, that was, you know, a few minutes that was wasted from games
548000	551000	that were in a sizzle reel that I felt deserved a little more time.
551000	554000	But I guess I'm getting ahead of myself. I apologize.
554000	556000	But this just sounds like something similar is that the time management
556000	558000	sometimes feels weird.
558000	563000	And you're like, I'm here to see video games, but Dark Soccer wants to.
563000	565000	Well, while she finishes chewing.
565000	569000	But it was a pretty big deal when the Beatles came out on State.
569000	571000	Well, obviously not all of them, but you know what I mean?
571000	573000	Those that are, you know, left. Exactly.
573000	577000	Well, and I believe the estates of the others came out to do the rock band
577000	579000	Beatles that one year. That was a big deal.
579000	583000	So Pele to come out and it would be a big frickin deal.
583000	586000	But it's pretty old now. A ten minute interview, I agree, is excessive.
586000	592000	But anyway, however, a lot of those are tactics, not just for promotion,
592000	600000	but for incomplete content or things they don't want to release too much about.
600000	602000	So like a curtain. Exactly.
602000	606000	A lot of times stuff like that is is a filler for a reason.
606000	608000	I don't think I don't look in mirrors.
608000	612000	I don't agree with that only because before they had this last year,
612000	614000	of course, before they had that whole interview,
614000	617000	they they win the detail with all the things that they added to the FIFA.
617000	619000	So they spend a good portion of time talking about the game.
619000	622000	And then they did this interview on top of it as like a special treat.
622000	625000	I see. It's like I get it. I get it.
625000	629000	You know, people are excited about this player, but that's not really.
629000	631000	This show is not a place for that.
631000	634000	And much like, you know, the awkward banter that they were doing,
634000	637000	I get it. That's the characters that those guys play.
637000	639000	As an outsider, I don't get it.
639000	643000	And if you're trying to grow the audience for this, that's not a way to do it.
643000	645000	It's just like this is really weird.
645000	648000	Yes, but does the largest game in the world need to grow its audience?
648000	652000	Yes. If you if you just give up on growing your audience, then what's the point?
652000	654000	Why release a new version each year then?
654000	658000	Fair enough. OK, so it sounds like the good for you is Battlefront.
658000	663000	The not so good for you. It sounds like some of the time management issues was a little bit like.
663000	666000	It was just OK. It wasn't. They showed off a trailer for.
666000	671000	But the publisher specific shows are not usually the big, big.
671000	674000	You know what I mean? The publisher specific ones are usually.
674000	677000	That's not necessarily true because prior to last year.
677000	683000	And even maybe last year Ubisoft just had like the best show I thought, you know, or pretty good show.
683000	687000	So, I mean, the publisher ones are still pretty important sometimes.
687000	690000	They did show off a trailer for Anthem, a very brief trailer.
690000	696000	And then they didn't really show anything because they're saying, OK, well, stay tuned for the Microsoft show because that's when we're going to show it off.
696000	698000	You know, a little bit of, you know, spoiler there.
698000	703000	But so there was that they mentioned as well as a new BioWare IP.
703000	706000	And then they had I could not remember what the EO.
706000	712000	They had the new like funded by EA or what I forget the program's called.
712000	716000	But they have a game that was by the.
716000	718000	The developer did a tale of two brothers.
718000	722000	It's so they have like it's like a prison escape game.
722000	725000	Yeah, I look kind of neat. So that was pretty cool.
725000	730000	And then I think they had another game as well, but I can't remember what it was.
730000	732000	Unfortunately, I didn't watch.
732000	735000	But I'm looking at the was it need for speed because I don't think I know.
735000	742000	We I've talked about need for speed. Was it a way out the way out was the one that was the developer by the two brothers one.
742000	746000	But got it. That is it's all on my notes.
746000	750000	I think that's it. Well, the EA access and origin access going free for a little bit.
750000	754000	Yeah. For a week. That's pretty cool. Yeah. To look into that. That's something there.
754000	758000	So, yeah. And the folks in chatter echoing it was a way out was the name of that game.
758000	761000	But I think we got that. So we're good. All right.
761000	764000	Let's move on, though, because I definitely you know, EA is one thing.
764000	767000	But obviously, Microsoft, something we've been really anticipating.
767000	770000	And, you know, what is Scorpio and what is all this?
770000	772000	So let's just jump into Microsoft.
772000	777000	And I don't necessarily want to go in order with every single thing they showed at the conference because there was a lot.
777000	780000	But I want to just quickly just jump into the big question.
780000	783000	Xbox one X is the new score is no longer Scorpio.
783000	786000	It is Xbox one X, which some people have pointed out.
786000	793000	There's a little bit of a cleverness to it because X box one X is an acronym for Xbox.
793000	798000	You could look at it that way. Well, quickly, what about the name?
798000	803000	Oh, actually, actually, one other thing I want to say before we really comment on anything, and this is important.
803000	807000	I realize this whole E3 week sometimes can be like a great thing.
807000	818000	It's like Christmas for gamers. And it can also be like a really like it can be a really hard time of year because it feels like there's so many people that just want to take it as an excuse to be the most cynical fucking gamer in the world.
818000	825000	And I just want to point out, sometimes we are critical about game companies here on OLR. Lord knows, Loki's had a share of Nintendo things.
825000	829000	But even when it comes to Nintendo, like there's good and there's bad.
829000	834000	And I think you can be a fan of video games, but always challenge what can be done better.
834000	839000	And I think if there's any critic out there that's 100 percent positive, that's probably dipping into fanboy a little bit.
839000	843000	If there's anybody that's 100 percent negative, well, that's just somebody cynical.
843000	848000	And I would ask, what is that bringing to gaming? Is that person even a gaming fan if they're just 100 percent negative all the time?
848000	855000	So I just want to kind of get that out is that I think it's important here where every gamer has a voice that we look at both the positive and the negative.
855000	860000	Because I think with Microsoft today, I'm definitely feeling both. There are some things I'm like really, really happy about.
860000	865000	There's some things where I'm not feeling so good about. And I think Microsoft, I don't know. I don't know.
865000	870000	But let's start with this. What about that name? Xbox One X. Loki?
870000	881000	I think it's just confusing. I mean, especially to me, being that it's just one letter off from the Xbox One S, both the S and X sound kind of similar.
881000	890000	And you're talking about, let's just say, the everyday mom and pop going in and buying their son or daughter a system.
890000	897000	And the systems look identical. It's going to be confusing aside from the price point and someone explaining to them what the difference is.
897000	907000	I thought Bobby had a hilarious comparison at the opening of his show tonight. Bobby Black Wolf, our pal here at VOG, had mentioned it was like the Tesla models.
907000	915000	You have a Tesla Model S and a Tesla Model X. And it's really funny because you kind of have the same thing going on with the Xboxes at this point.
915000	922000	I just thought that was funny. You're right. S and X sound. Now we just need an Xbox One E.
923000	926000	But you know what? We have the elite controllers. There you go. Sex.
929000	931000	Dark Sakura? I don't know. You probably didn't...
931000	934000	I don't see how someone would make that error when asking for one.
934000	941000	These are the same people, though, that confuse the Wii U for an accessory for the Wii. So I'm giving them no benefit.
942000	952000	As I was saying, I think, though, that the average person is going to go in with at least staff working there that will say, what do you mean, this or this?
952000	956000	And show them the difference. That's what they're trained to do.
956000	964000	Although I do think the S and X is a little confusing, I actually don't hate the name. I think it's fine.
964000	978000	Because what I like about it is that unlike Wii, see, there's a big difference here between Wii U and Wii and Xbox X and Xbox S, is that the Xbox One is meant to be one ecosystem.
978000	985000	Wii and Wii U were separate things. I mean, yes, the Wii U played Wii games, but we all know that was kind of a struggle for Nintendo throughout the life of the Wii U.
985000	988000	But let me get away from Nintendo because this isn't about them.
988000	994000	But the Xbox One S and Xbox One X, the thing that I like about that is that it kind of emphasizes that it's one ecosystem.
994000	1000000	So it's like you can go with the S model that does, it plays the games, but it's, you know, it's only 1080 and da-da-da-da-da.
1000000	1004000	Or you can go with the X that's going to be more expensive, but it does 4K and da-da-da-da.
1004000	1009000	So the thing I like about it is that it does emphasize it's still one ecosystem.
1010000	1015000	Because I still think there's some people out there that for some reason didn't get the memo when Microsoft said,
1015000	1021000	all of these games that come out on, using my quoted fingers, Scorpio, are going to work on Xbox One.
1021000	1029000	This is not a new system. It is a new way to play the games that are already out there. Loki?
1029000	1035000	I don't buy that. You know why I don't buy that? Because history has shown otherwise.
1035000	1042000	You have like a company like Nintendo, for example, that they'll have games like that be like on the 3DS or the new 3DS or something like that.
1042000	1048000	And all of a sudden it's like, oh yeah, I'll play both these games. And then, oh wait, no, now it's only exclusive to this platform.
1048000	1054000	I see in a couple years, to be fair, that was like two games for Nintendo.
1054000	1057000	But I see in a couple years easily that they'll go back on that word.
1057000	1061000	And I'm not saying that, I'm not blaming Microsoft at all. Sony will do the same shit.
1062000	1068000	So both of them are going to go back on that and they're going to only, because they got to keep pushing that graphic fidelity and they're going to keep doing it.
1068000	1071000	But isn't that kind of what we expect though?
1071000	1077000	But then don't fucking come out and lie about it then. I mean, I understand right now they will do that.
1077000	1084000	I mean, whatever. I mean, they have to push both platforms. So obviously they're going to say that it's going to always do that.
1084000	1086000	But I don't believe in always.
1086000	1092000	Speaking of Sony, did you catch the little dig at them with the whole, and this does 4K Blu-ray?
1092000	1098000	Yeah, and I'm, they should. Because there's no reason their system should not do that.
1098000	1105000	Okay, alright, fair enough. So, let me ask you this. Were you sold on an Xbox One X, why or why not?
1105000	1110000	And I opened this up to chat too, because I want to see some of your comments. Were you sold on an Xbox One X today, why or why not?
1110000	1116000	No, I'm not. Because I have a PC that can run PC games. And guess what?
1116000	1122000	Every year it's like, what exclusive games are you going to have for this system that's going to sell this system for me?
1122000	1130000	And guess what? All of those games are on PC. So why am I going to drop, with a $4.99, which was the price point for it,
1130000	1134000	why am I going to drop $4.99 for this when I have a PC that can run these games?
1135000	1142000	There's no reason for me to do that. I don't own a 4K TV. No reason for me to invest $500 in that and not have a TV to play it on.
1142000	1151000	Yeah, oh yeah, it enhances 1080p games. But you know what? Who cares? I have a 1080p screen on my computer and I'm fine with just playing with that.
1151000	1161000	I don't need to play it 4K, but also like Crackdown, which is a game I'm looking forward to, it's not going to sell me the system because I can play that on my PC.
1161000	1168000	Some comments in chat. YYR says, if the price was $3.99, I would have grabbed it day one. At $4.99, I might wait.
1168000	1176000	DCB Needle Crash says, I'm not really sold on it. 4K 60 frames a second can be achieved on PC. I have a PC that can do it, minus the 4K monitors.
1176000	1185000	Zeba says, I was sold on it, but then they said the price, it's too much in my opinion. JD says, simply no because I don't buy Xboxes.
1185000	1193000	Dark Soccer, I know you didn't get to see, or at least I don't think you saw the Microsoft thing today because you were doing other errands, but your household doesn't have an Xbox One at all, right?
1193000	1194000	Nope, but it's not going to.
1194000	1195000	So this didn't sell you on it?
1195000	1196000	No.
1196000	1204000	Because I would think that maybe for people who waited and don't have an Xbox yet, maybe the Xbox One X could be that thing.
1204000	1207000	It might be. I think it needs to come down to price. I think the price point's too high.
1208000	1223000	Well, I mean, in answering your question, I have a PC. I have a Mac. I have a Linux computer. I have so many choices on what to play my games on that none of that matters to me.
1223000	1231000	I have a PS4. I have a Wii U. I don't care about the Switch yet, except I kind of want to play ARMS, but that's about it.
1231000	1236000	It's slowly winning you. Nintendo's thing Tuesday night.
1236000	1254000	Well, it wasn't that there was anything to win. I was just indifferent, you know, and I'm still a little indifferent. I have Therians I could play theirs, but I don't see anything that's making it worth me putting a fiscal consideration into it. Does that make sense? It's not worth the money yet.
1255000	1263000	To piggyback on that, because I definitely have a thought that's similar to you guys, is that I think probably the biggest minus I can put in Microsoft.
1263000	1269000	Well, here, I'm going to give you a big plus, and I'm going to give you a big minus right after the fact from Microsoft's thing today.
1269000	1276000	The big plus was I was not expecting to be sold on 4K gaming because I don't have a 4K television yet.
1277000	1287000	But when they were showing Forza, when they were showing Anthem, and some of those games they were showing today, I was like, fuck, these games are gorgeous, even though I'm watching it on a 1080p downgrade.
1287000	1297000	I'm like, I can only imagine what this would probably look like on an actual 4K TV. So, I would say, in a way, Microsoft really made me fucking pay attention to 4K gaming today.
1297000	1303000	I was going into it thinking, it's too soon. It's way too soon for 4K gaming. Microsoft's going to shoot themselves in the foot with this.
1303000	1317000	That's what they should do if they're smart. If they're smart, come holiday, when this is out, and they have all those retail set ups running these really nice 4K TVs, partner with a company that manufactures those to knock off some of the price of the system.
1317000	1319000	Or one of those specialty stores in Best Buy or something.
1319000	1327000	Yeah, like a Best Buy. So, I'm saying that knocks off the price of the system like 100 bucks or something like that if you purchase a 4K TV, because that's going to not only sell the 4K TV, but that'll sell the system.
1327000	1331000	Did you want to jump in here before I get to my negative? Oh, I thought you were trying to say something.
1331000	1352000	No, I'm just sitting here thinking, I have a 4K TV. I've played games on a 4K, actually on a 5K Retina Mac. I think that it would be pretty, but I was just thinking about first person shooters and how nauseous I would get.
1352000	1354000	Too much overload.
1354000	1356000	I got really nauseous playing.
1356000	1362000	At some point, I know you're a BioWare fangirl, I really want to get your take on the Anthem footage at some point.
1362000	1364000	I'd have to take time to watch it.
1364000	1366000	I know, I know. It doesn't take that long.
1366000	1373000	I'll be honest, I didn't care to look at it, because I'm still kind of peeved over what they did with Mass Effect Andromeda.
1373000	1377000	They sold Mass Effect up the river to make Anthem.
1377000	1381000	We know why Mass Effect Andromeda is the way it is now, because of what they did with this game.
1382000	1388000	I would have rather that the tension went to Mass Effect Andromeda. So I'm a little bitter and I don't care.
1388000	1398000	Well, I think in some way you should watch it so you can have a little more basis on what you're going back and forth on, but that's just my opinion.
1398000	1404000	Because Anthem was third person, so I feel like it might not be as bad for a lot of those things.
1404000	1411000	With Anthem, and I guess I'm getting a little ahead of myself, we didn't see story from Anthem.
1411000	1414000	When it comes to BioWare, a lot of us think of story.
1414000	1417000	When Alan was watching it with me, he kind of made that point.
1417000	1420000	With BioWare, I expect story. This is giving me none of that.
1420000	1423000	But for me, when I was watching that gameplay, I was like, this is hot.
1423000	1427000	This is Mass Effect multiplayer, which I love, but in a huge world.
1427000	1431000	So I'm like, I could get down with this, but I want to see more.
1431000	1434000	But anyway, I'm digressing a little bit. So I gave my positive, or my plus.
1434000	1439000	My plus is, Microsoft convinced me 4K gaming could be the future today.
1439000	1444000	Here's the negative. I was not convinced I need an Xbox One X to do it.
1444000	1451000	Because walking away from my TV or whatever, leaving that press conference, I was like, I need to upgrade my computer.
1451000	1460000	I need to upgrade my computer from what it is now to be able to support 4K gaming, which is something I was already on the fence with.
1460000	1466000	But every single one of those things they showed today, they were saying it was Windows 10 as well as the Xbox.
1466000	1479000	So there's nothing that is specific to consoles. It is only the Xbox ecosystem, if you will.
1479000	1484000	Yeah, it's really just third parties. I don't know.
1485000	1488000	I mean, that's even what it was like last year.
1488000	1491000	And let's just step back for a second here.
1491000	1498000	Microsoft really overuses the word exclusive for stuff that's not quite exclusive.
1498000	1501000	I mean, eh.
1501000	1505000	It's more like they had an exclusive trailer for a game that's coming to multiple systems.
1505000	1508000	It's like World Premiere. It's like, dude, what the fuck is this shit?
1508000	1513000	I mean, like, I get it. You're trying to say you have all these exclusive titles, but they're not really exclusive.
1513000	1522000	They're like, it's out first on Xbox, or we have the console exclusive for this game that's been out on PC already, or I don't know.
1522000	1525000	They're overusing it.
1525000	1529000	I want to go from some comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1529000	1533000	Some people commenting on Anthem. Ziba says, Anthem looks beautiful.
1533000	1537000	Bobby Blackwell says, I'm glad the attention went to a new IP.
1537000	1541000	We keep crying for new IPs, but then we bitch when they make new IPs.
1541000	1545000	And then, let's see, other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1545000	1550000	Tigerclaw says, BioWare's A-Team was spending more time on Anthem than they were with Mass Effect Andromeda.
1550000	1558000	Yeah, and that's, I mean, I can understand why as a Mass Effect fan that can be a little bit of a, wow, I got screwed in this equation.
1558000	1560000	I'm watching this gameplay and it's just pissing me off.
1560000	1562000	But even like...
1562000	1565000	I'm sorry, I'm not understanding. Why? Why is it pissing you off?
1565000	1570000	Because I would have rather the attention go into Mass Effect. Mass Effect could have been this.
1570000	1575000	But here's the thing though, like Mass Effect never drew me into it. This looks awesome. Like this I'd want to play.
1575000	1581000	So interesting. Interesting. I don't know. I mean, it's just, this is one of those cases where everybody has different opinions. I don't know.
1581000	1589000	All right. SSG100Matt in chat says, each segment on OLR should have the exclusive tag before it starts.
1589000	1591000	Windows 10 and Xbox One exclusive.
1591000	1595000	I've heard some, I've heard some podcasts that do it and it gets old, trust me.
1595000	1610000	And Square, I mean Square Enix, come on. What is up with episodic everything, dude? Like the Life is Strange prequels episode, episodic thing. I mean, that's kind of annoying.
1610000	1612000	It's probably a full game.
1612000	1622000	Well, but yeah, but some people, I mean, that was the highlight of the whole day in convention or the whole dang show for some people was the fact that they're doing that prequel to Life is Strange.
1622000	1624000	I don't know.
1624000	1628000	Here's the other thing too, is that people are comparing it to Destiny and I don't like Destiny.
1628000	1637000	I don't think, I wasn't getting the Destiny vibe from it. I'm just not, somebody like two weeks ago said it was going to be BioWare's Destiny and one of those things.
1637000	1645000	And now everybody is saying it's BioWare's Destiny. And I'm like, I didn't get that read from, because Destiny reminds me of Halo.
1645000	1648000	It doesn't remind me of, of what I saw, but that's me.
1648000	1651000	I also hate Halo.
1651000	1654000	But I'm saying Anthem looks nothing like it to me.
1655000	1662000	Now that we've, we've had time to digest some of the footage from Anthem, how the fuck am I going to fuck people in that suit is what I want to know.
1662000	1667000	I mean, like, is it built for that? I mean, is that even a thing? I can't figure out how that's going to work.
1667000	1670000	No, no, no. In Anthem, in Anthem's suit, fuck you.
1670000	1674000	Am I going to like get a flying start in somebody? I mean, like, how's that going to work?
1674000	1678000	They've got a flashlight built in or, you know, the reverse for ladies.
1678000	1684000	All right. Tiger Claw says Anthem was giving me an Iron Man vibe because of the armor with the jetpack.
1684000	1690000	It looked pretty cool. Now, in some of the other stuff that they're showing off, Sea of Thieves spent way too much time on that shit.
1690000	1698000	Spent way too much time on Sea of Thieves. But I mean, it looked, you know, Rare is one of their people that's pumping them new IPs.
1698000	1703000	And so that's cool. And there were things about the game that I liked, but you know, okay, here's the thing with Sea of Thieves.
1703000	1708000	What they showed at the press conference, I was like, okay, whatever. And then I'm like, wow, this is going on a long time.
1708000	1713000	Still going, still going. It's trying to be self-referential and cute and have that Rare wit. Okay, whatever.
1713000	1718000	But here's the thing. After the conference was over, if you went back onto Mixer on their Xbox channel,
1718000	1722000	they were doing some type of Sea of Thieves reveal or, you know, first look.
1722000	1730000	And they were using that Mixer thing that actually had four people playing it at once for the developers.
1730000	1738000	And they were just playing the game for real and talking to each other. And I was like, this sells me more on the game than what they showed in that thing that they showed on stage.
1738000	1742000	And it also is selling the benefits of Mixer. Missed opportunity, in my opinion.
1742000	1749000	And also, I'd rather see, I mean, don't get me wrong, the cheesy pirate dialogue was kind of funny for the little trailer.
1749000	1754000	The year before was really cringey with the fake, you know, chit chat stuff.
1754000	1763000	I'd rather see, like, developers just kind of talking about their game and just idly chit chatting and stuff over it instead of all this fake bullshit that they added in there.
1763000	1771000	And to be fair, Anthem had that shit too. I mean, they had the fake chit chat over, you know, for multiplayer that kind of annoyed me.
1771000	1778000	Terry Crews and Crackdown. I'm on board. I was on board Crackdown already. Terry Crews added to it. Yes, I'll buy it twice.
1779000	1784000	Yeah, that whole reveal was pretty good. And it's got such a Tron look to it, which, you know, I live for.
1784000	1794000	I'm a little worried because I don't see all that destruction that was promised before. Remember, the cloud was going to make all this destruction happen or something like that.
1794000	1806000	I'd not seen that in the trailer anymore. So, I don't know if that's been omitted from it or not, because it was quite brief, aside from Terry Crews being there, which I'm fine with.
1807000	1812000	I don't know. Or if that's still going to be like online only, because they were saying that online was going to have that originally.
1812000	1820000	Bummer that that means he was probably too busy to do Doomfist for all the people that were hoping for that on the Blizzard front, is that now he's in Crackdown 3.
1820000	1821000	But at least he got in a video game somewhere.
1821000	1823000	I don't think he was. It's just voice.
1823000	1834000	That's true. That's true. Voice actors can do lots and lots of games. And it missed our show tonight, but somebody posted a thing on my Facebook that says that with that whole strike thing, they are going back to the table for more talks.
1834000	1840000	So that's a good thing that maybe there's going to be resolution on that whole front while E3 is going on. But anyway, I digress.
1840000	1849000	Yes, I was excited about Crackdown 3 as well. I was almost surprised that that didn't get as much time as some of the other things they spent a lot of time on.
1849000	1856000	For me, they spent way too much time on that Shadows of War. Was that what it's called? The Shadows of Mordor game, basically.
1856000	1859000	It looks cool. I like the way they spent a long time.
1859000	1861000	But they spent way too much time on something that's not an exclusive.
1861000	1866000	Well, they did the same thing with Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Origins.
1866000	1868000	Yeah, that's true.
1868000	1871000	With my UAV Hawk.
1871000	1884000	See, I'm not usually into Assassin's Creed games. I'm not. But I was excited to see that. That in particular was a good little feature that they did because it finally allowed me to see this is what actual gameplay looks like in 4K.
1884000	1890000	Or at least in the alpha footage because we all know that sometimes games don't look like what they look like on the E3 stage.
1890000	1896000	But at least it still gives you a sense like this is what the game is intended to actually look like when you're playing it. And we were getting that from Assassin's Creed.
1896000	1909000	And remember my hope out of E3 was those wow moments like, wow, you know, I was not expecting this. Metro Exodus, I think, was that wow moment for me because I wasn't really familiar with Metro until I had the review last light.
1910000	1917000	And so I got to play through it and I really liked it. I know you hate kind of like a lot of the first person shooters, but this is more of like a story driven first person shooter.
1917000	1922000	I'd say it's more like a Bioshock or like actually Bioshock is pretty good.
1922000	1928000	I don't I don't hate all the first person shooters, but I'm not a big fan of jump scares. And doesn't this game kind of use a lot of those?
1928000	1936000	It's not so bad. It's just like, I mean, Bioshock does the same thing. It's kind of similar to that. It's got it's not entirely jump scares. There are some of those.
1936000	1945000	It looked nice for what it was. I mean, I'm not I'm not going to lie. You know, I you know, and it's like I said, I I don't like to always take the cynical gamer perspective.
1945000	1952000	Yes, there are some things I get irritated about, but I feel like I can sit there and go like with Assassin's Creed, I can sit there and go, you know, I'm probably not going to buy this game.
1952000	1958000	This is usually a series I get into, but this looks nice. And I bet some people are really into this. And this is a good thing for Microsoft right now.
1958000	1967000	So, you know, I and that's I had a similar take with the Metro as I was like, OK, for people that are into this, this looks really hot in 4K.
1967000	1974000	But I don't know if this will be something I buy day one, but you never know. Sometimes I find new things I don't expect I'm going to buy.
1974000	1983000	Now, one of the things that they didn't spend a whole lot of time on was talking about some of those in Xbox indie stuff like the idea of Xbox games.
1983000	1991000	That went way too fast for me. I was really upset with that because there was stuff in there I wanted to know more about. There was a freaking Fable card game in there.
1991000	1993000	And I was like, what? Yeah. Is that like Hearthstone?
1993000	2003000	Yeah, that's supposed to be coming out soon. The last night was that one that was all kind of Sprite is the whole, you know, was it Cyberpunk Sprite looking game?
2003000	2005000	Mm hmm. That looks pretty similar.
2005000	2011000	Something Devolver Digital would have usually be putting out. But yeah, I got it. Yeah, that was interesting.
2011000	2018000	Let's see. Oh, oh, I got to mention one that got me excited. The sequel to Ori. Because Ori and the Blind Forest, beautiful game.
2018000	2026000	It's Metroid-esque, but I hate calling it that because it makes you think it's Metroid. It's not, but it's, you know, that whole type of like type of game.
2026000	2032000	But Ori is beautiful. If you haven't played it, you know, give it a shot. I must confess, I haven't beaten it, but I've spent a good chunk of time with it and I really enjoy it.
2032000	2039000	So when they announced the sequel, which I think had been leaked a couple days prior, I was really excited to hear that they are continuing on with it.
2039000	2046000	And that they kind of featured it as much as they did. Usually games like that for Microsoft are kind of a, oh, and this too, that's it.
2046000	2052000	You know, kind of like what they did with Cuphead. But people were pointing out to me that Cuphead, they've been teasing for years.
2052000	2059000	And now finally, so I kind of get it in that regard. But like when I was seeing the Cuphead footage, I was like, fuck, this game looks hot.
2059000	2061000	I am so looking forward to Cuphead.
2061000	2068000	And don't let them confuse you into believing that you can only get that shit on the Windows 10 store. It's on fucking Steam. Do not buy it on the Windows 10 store.
2068000	2071000	Don't buy anything on the Windows 10 store if you can avoid it.
2071000	2078000	Well, to be fair, didn't they say it was Xbox Anywhere? So if you bought it on the Windows 10 store, you would also have the Xbox One version.
2078000	2087000	So that might sell some people on it. Some people may not care about that. But see, for me, I'm sorry, I find that Steam isn't going to put it on a console for me.
2087000	2095000	Except my Steam Box. But that thing, those Steam Boxes don't wear well. They don't. They don't handle well. Anyway.
2095000	2102000	Okay, so let's see. Going to, just a couple other things I want to point out.
2102000	2109000	Okay, this is one that got a lot of people going, ooh, Minecraft. Because one of the things they announced is that Minecraft is going to 4K.
2109000	2119000	And of course, Twitter, when I think 4K, I think of Minecraft. I have to admit, I liked what they show. I mean, it didn't make me go like, oh my god.
2119000	2126000	But I was like, neat, it's a free update. And these graphics, yeah, they look cool. For keeping the Minecraft aesthetic. I was so happy with it.
2126000	2132000	I've been saying that they should be doing some of the custom shaders that they have out there and stuff.
2133000	2139000	Because I was like, well, they've got all this power that's in these consoles. You can't tell me that they can't upgrade the way Minecraft looks.
2139000	2146000	I get it, you keep everything looking blocky as it is. But there's still some pretty nice shaders out there, like Sonic Ether's unbelievable shaders.
2146000	2152000	And they have a lot of other ones that are kind of similar type stuff, where they change the quality of the water.
2152000	2157000	And they change some of the foliage and the lighting and everything. And it kind of looks like that's what this is.
2158000	2162000	Except the ones that have been out for several years still look better than this.
2162000	2164000	So you're basically saying modders did it better.
2164000	2172000	Modders did it better already, and I'm like, come on. It's only a little bit more that they gotta push it to make it look nice.
2172000	2180000	And it's alright, I guess, but it could be just so much better with just a tiny bit more effort put in.
2180000	2187000	But to be fair, the other thing they announced, I know you're a little more hyped about, and that's the fact that now there's going to be cross-play on everything, basically.
2187000	2197000	Yeah, they were talking about that before, how they were going to do that. And before it was just Android, iOS, and VR, and the Windows 10 version, which I think works right now.
2197000	2204000	But now it's also going to include the Xbox One, I'm assuming the Switch.
2204000	2213000	And I don't know if the Xbox 360 is going to do it as well, but I know the Xbox One. I think it's all the newer gen ones, because I don't think the Wii U...
2213000	2215000	But not PlayStation 4.
2215000	2218000	No, not PlayStation 4, because...
2218000	2223000	They couldn't work it out. But obviously there's a Sony-Microsoft conflict there.
2223000	2231000	But I'm sorry, but that was somewhat powerful to me, to see a Nintendo Switch of sorts at Microsoft's conference.
2231000	2233000	I give them props for that.
2233000	2235000	That was very interesting to me, to see that.
2235000	2239000	It is. And that's more power to it.
2239000	2248000	And for those who don't know what I'm referring to, it wasn't the device itself, but it was a mock-up one made out of blocks. There was no mistake, it was a Nintendo Switch with the blue and red controllers in the Minecraft world.
2248000	2254000	And for a company to show even a picture of another company's product like that, I thought was kind of a big deal.
2254000	2262000	And they basically said they have the marketplace coming, which is supposed to be mod-supporting, so it's user-created skins and tile packs that they're going to have.
2262000	2274000	The thing I don't necessarily like about it, I guess it's alright, but they can sell skins, so they don't have to necessarily be free, so you can buy that.
2274000	2283000	So you can say, oh, they're going to add microtransactions to it, but then again they have skins that are being sold now that they sell from Microsoft, so I guess it's not a huge deal.
2283000	2298000	But the fact that they're doing the cross-platform play is pretty awesome. They're doing the Realm stuff, which they're going to basically allow you to have your own server that can work across all these different platforms, which is pretty cool.
2298000	2307000	I wish they had free options for that, but whatever, I guess that's the limitations you have with this process. So that's all good stuff.
2307000	2314000	Stoppy in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I wonder if that's a sign that they are cutting PlayStation 4 support completely. That's it.
2314000	2320000	No, I don't think that they're cutting support for the PlayStation 4. I think it's just Sony is just not playing nice.
2320000	2324000	So there could be a thing with PlayStation Network and that whole thing.
2324000	2335000	It's not surprising. I think it's more like the Nintendo Switch is surprising, whereas the PlayStation is not. Does that make sense?
2335000	2345000	I would have fully expected that it's only Windows 10 to Xbox to tablets and that's it. The fact that Nintendo is involved is a surprise in a way. Anyway.
2345000	2351000	And then of course the console. But I think it's pretty awesome. Oh, and VR, but that's such a small portion of it.
2351000	2357000	Well, let's just hit on a couple other quick things, and then I do want to move on for the sake of time. We still have a lot of news that didn't even come out from these conferences.
2357000	2365000	But there are a couple of big things at the conference I want to touch on. One of them, you just mentioned a little bit, VR, or in this case, lack thereof.
2365000	2371000	Surprised at all that Microsoft did not touch VR, AR, any of it.
2371000	2382000	I don't think it's ready yet, which is weird. I don't know. Maybe that's a tough thing right there, because if they're talking all this one ecosystem thing, are they going to be able to push that?
2382000	2388000	If they were going to put out VR for Xbox One, I don't think they have really enough yet to show for that.
2388000	2399000	That's why I think they're taking the safe route with 4K gaming, because at least they know 4K is kind of a technology that's being adopted a little bit quicker than say VR right now or VR AR.
2399000	2409000	So it's probably more of a safe bet. Not that they'll say they can't do that later on with the power that they have in the Xbox One X, but it's probably a little bit too early to show off anything, or too much of a gamble.
2409000	2419000	Yeah. Well, maybe, especially since the hardware they're pushing this year is Xbox One X, they really wanted to say, you need 4K games, and they just wanted to focus on that message today.
2419000	2427000	And I don't fault them for that. If the HoloLens concept or whatever isn't ready for consumers, then it's not the time to show it. Let that bake another year, that's fine.
2427000	2444000	Really, when you think about it, with VR and what they probably would implement, they don't have a camera really. It's going to be weird if they said, oh yeah, we're going to have you buy a camera, connect, and then it would work with this VR headset.
2444000	2454000	And that just seems weird. I know that they have tech now that actually uses the actual headset as the camera to read the room and everything, but I think it's just too early for them to announce anything.
2455000	2457000	And like I said, this is probably the safer route to go.
2459000	2465000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundry Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, taxi.
2465000	2478000	And one more thing I'll mention about this conference, then we're going to move on to our gaming weeks, but I think this was the thing that nobody thought would be announced, and was kind of the big surprise, original Xbox compatibility.
2478000	2487000	And it's funny because we're coming off of this whole, oh, Alan's here and he brought me a frappuccino, what a nice boy, thank you so much.
2487000	2496000	Wow, so this is vanilla with a thank you. That was worth interrupting the show for. Thank you, Alan, I really appreciate that.
2496000	2500000	Okay, did you bring enough for the whole class? I'm just kidding. Alright, sorry guys.
2500000	2514000	Alright, anyway, so Xbox original system compatibility. I don't think anybody was expecting that, but very interesting the fact that it's the same week that there's been a lot in the news, you know, ours, or one of those, was it ours?
2514000	2515000	Yeah, ours said it.
2515000	2525000	Did their own type of investigation and Microsoft's really kind of pushed back and said, you're wrong, basically without being so harsh about it, they're just basically saying the way you analyze this was not right.
2525000	2530000	I would probably trust a platform holder that can actually see those statistics versus like an independent.
2530000	2539000	Well, here it is, all that talk at the end of the day, Microsoft believed in it enough to double down on it by saying, and now here is original Xbox support.
2539000	2543000	That to me is much more powerful than the he said, she said of the numbers game.
2543000	2555000	Exactly. I mean, like, think about it. That's like, that's definitely uncalled for. No one really expected that or even necessarily was demanding that it was just something that, Hey, we can do this.
2555000	2571000	So, but that being said, will you, you, well, you don't own an Xbox one, so I guess maybe you're the wrong person. Would this mean that Xbox games could work on PC? I guess not. Cause I know I'm still don't, I would be awesome, but no, I, I, I'm curious to see what games they support.
2571000	2590000	I still have most of my games from original Xbox, like halo one and halo two, uh, DDR universe. Although what I expect is going to happen is that, and this sounds silly, but I expect it's going to be the Xbox emulator on 360 emulated through Xbox 360 emulation emulator of an emulator.
2590000	2595000	I mean, why not? That makes sense, right? Couldn't Microsoft just do that?
2596000	2611000	I don't know if that would be the way they do that. Maybe they have a better way of doing it now. Um, the other thing I was going to mention too, one of the caveats of that is, um, they were saying that with that system link is going to be working across all three generations.
2611000	2622000	So like, say you wanted to bring out your Xbox one with halo two running on it, you can play that against an original Xbox. Oh, snap. That's pretty cool. Yeah. So that's pretty neat. Wow. That's great.
2622000	2632000	That's great. So, so go, well, that's because I guess the architecture of Xbox live hasn't changed drastically since the original Xbox. Well, yeah, it's all system link is without Xbox live as well.
2632000	2644000	So, I mean, it's probably, it kind of makes sense that it would work. Crackdown was one of those games that support system link. Well, that's great. I hope, I hope even the, the streaming stuff works with the original Xbox games and all the stuff they built into 360 games.
2644000	2658000	That would be rad, especially for a retro game fan like me. I'm really excited about that. All right, so there you go. So, so overall, uh, the Microsoft stuff, how are you guys feeling? Anything you guys want to say further to kind of wrap up this Microsoft thing?
2658000	2672000	I think, I mean, I'm just getting a little tired of all the zombie games. Honestly, it was stated the cage. It felt like, you know, especially in the beginning it was like, Oh, Hey, it's arena game. Oh, Hey, it's a zombie game up now. Another arena game.
2672000	2683000	It's like, dude, let's show some different types of games. That was a little bit tiresome. I think there's a lot of titles that they showed that I'm just not interested in, but there were a few that were interesting.
2683000	2696000	Sadly enough though, and as I've been saying for the last few years, they haven't shown me anything that wants, that's convinced me to buy their console. And yeah, I guess I have a copy of windows 10, so there's a win for them.
2696000	2707000	But dude, it's kind of like my only option, you know, if I want to experience most of the stuff that's out there. So I wouldn't exactly call that a win means cause it's kind of a requirement.
2707000	2722000	But on top of that, it's just, I don't know. I mean, that's the thing is like, what's selling me on this. If I have a PC that can run it, nothing. So who's the, if you're like trying to sell an enthusiast on this, who is really the target audience for this?
2722000	2737000	I don't know for, yeah, uh, for me, the big winner today was PC gaming was the big winner today. Uh, and I was, I guess I am more ready for 4k gaming than I thought I was. Um, and I look forward to playing a lot of those games that were shown on my PC.
2737000	2740000	I guess, you know, that's the weird, that's the weird place.
2740000	2757000	If you don't have a high end PC and you really don't want to drop, like it's probably gonna be over a thousand dollars for one, then it's not a bad option if you already have a 4k TV to drop $499 for it. So I could see that as a plus if you don't have a PC that can run that stuff. But if you do, there's probably not really anything for you there.
2757000	2774000	And YYR in chat kind of reemphasizing that saying, please remind yourselves of this fact, most gamers do not have gaming PCs. So that's, that's who the Xbox one X is ultimately for at the end of the day. But for us, I guess here as gamers, we're not feeling that because we, most of us do run computer rigs.
2774000	2796000	Well, and then on top of that though, if you do not have a 4k TV and you're not really looking to spend the money on one, I mean, they did just drop the price of the Xbox one at least this week is going to be $50 cheaper. So that might be something to consider or wait until holiday, uh, when those games come out and wait for the deals. I bet you anything they're going to have a bundle with a crackdown at some point. So just wait.
2796000	2811000	All right. Well, let's get into the video games that we have been playing this week with how was your gaming week? Uh, believe it or not, we still have a lot of other news to get into and we will get to those. We're going to try to fit in your calls tonight as well at orange lounge radio on Skype a little later in the show.
2811000	2818000	But again, we do have to end at nine o'clock due to other E3 events going on, but we do, of course we have to talk about our gaming weeks. There's still stuff we're playing dark soccer.
2818000	2833000	Um, Shane owned me the nonary games, so I didn't get a chance to start them yet, but it's ready to go. I've been busy weekend. Um, I started, I actually played a little world before craft, uh, play the usual stuff on the phone.
2833000	2856000	I also, out of just morbid curiosity, downloaded dragon ball online and, um, it, it makes me think a lot of, um, the second iteration of, um, Ragnarok online, kind of that same feel. Um, the game, the English version anyway is very unfinished.
2856000	2885000	Um, I mean the game is there, but like several whole quests are still in Korean. So it wasn't even developed by a Japanese company. It's, it's all in Korean. Um, and then some that's in English and like it's poorly translated English at that. So I don't know. It's, it's kind of neat. It's novel, but I'm probably not going to play any more of it. Um, but that's really the only thing new and notable on my list.
2886000	2889000	All right. Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
2889000	2904000	I didn't play a whole ton. I played a little bit of grand theft out of five. Just kind of mess around with that. I did play this game though that I saw, I think it was out of a game jam that someone created and he had linked it on Twitter. It's a game called Baba is you. And what it was, it's a very simple.
2904000	2907000	Oh, the Babadook is very in right now. I don't know if you know about this.
2907000	2908000	The what?
2908000	2910000	The Babadook is
2910000	2912000	It's officially, um, an icon.
2912000	2915000	The LGBT icon of 2017, the Babadook.
2915000	2916000	Babaslay.
2916000	2918000	Yes. I am Babashook, honey.
2918000	2919000	Yes.
2919000	2922000	Okay. Well, I don't understand what the hell you're talking about right now.
2923000	2924000	That's fair. Okay.
2924000	2925000	Work Baba.
2925000	2940000	Okay. For those, for those that don't understand, there is a horror film called Babadook and Netflix in its glory of categorizing things on Netflix accidentally put this movie in LGBT films this week.
2940000	2951000	So now this is this huge meme is that the Babadook, which is, you know, a killer monster thing that kind of looks like, I don't know, is this huge LGBT icon.
2951000	2957000	And already there's been, there were some parades, I think in Washington, DC, there's Babadooks in the parade.
2957000	2960000	Somebody went to the drag race finale that was taped.
2960000	2965000	One of the, like one of the, not one of the drag queens on the show, but somebody went dressed as the Babadook.
2965000	2972000	So this is the hot new LGBT sensation for 2017 is the Babadook.
2972000	2976000	So it's getting to say the word Babadook.
2976000	2977000	Okay.
2977000	2979000	This has nothing to do with that.
2979000	2980000	Sadly.
2980000	2983000	So Baba is You is basically, it's a puzzle game.
2983000	2988000	So the point of the game is to get to the win condition in there.
2988000	2992000	So a lot of it is, and what's fun is it's kind of like programming.
2992000	2997000	So in, within the game screen itself, they'll have, you know, little phrases.
2997000	3005000	So Baba is You, and then they'll have like flag is win, brick is stop, that type of stuff.
3005000	3017000	And so you have to get through these mazes by not only manipulating, you know, where you're going, but by also manipulating these conditions in there by pushing stuff around.
3017000	3024000	So like, for example, you could push, you know, brick into is you, and then you become all the bricks on the map.
3024000	3030000	Or, you know, you could put like that touching the fire, which would normally kill you, is win.
3030000	3034000	And so all of a sudden touching the fire is the win condition in the game.
3034000	3038000	And so it's kind of clever in that sense that you have to keep moving stuff around.
3038000	3044000	And so I enjoyed it. It was like 12 levels that the guy made for this game jam and finished in about like 30 minutes.
3044000	3045000	But it's fun.
3045000	3046000	That's a fun concept.
3046000	3053000	That's a pretty cool concept. So go check it out. Baba is You. I think it's on itch.io. So go search for it and it's free.
3053000	3058000	So why not? And then what else they play?
3058000	3065000	Honestly, that's it. I've been thinking about things like to do for like streaming because since everybody's getting on that stream, streaming train.
3065000	3071000	So one of the concepts I came up with was, you know, I like the Elder Scrolls Skyrim.
3071000	3076000	So I wanted to do, you know, just kind of like, you know, mod rim.
3076000	3083000	So basically it would be a Skyrim game with some really terrible mods, like I'd randomly pick like 100 terrible mods.
3083000	3092000	And then from that, I'd start off with like, you know, say 25 of them enabled and it would be at random and then keep adding to it each time until the game just breaks.
3092000	3099000	OK, I like that. There are modern shows on Twitch, but I like your concept. I do just say it would be stranger and stranger each time.
3099000	3100000	That's the whole point.
3100000	3105000	That's good. I feel like now I need a concept because everybody else, you know, Bobby wants to do this whole more VR streaming thing.
3105000	3109000	You want to do your mod thing. And I feel like I need an angle.
3109000	3111000	I just think, I don't know. I couldn't think of anything interesting.
3111000	3112000	That's good.
3112000	3116000	Other than if I could go back and play Grand Theft Auto 4 because I kicked ass at Grand Theft Auto 4.
3116000	3119000	Nobody's playing Grand Theft Auto 4, so who knows?
3119000	3127000	Come on. Come on a night like this in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says call it Loki's bad rim stream.
3128000	3129000	Bad rim stream?
3130000	3132000	There's a joke there. But anyway, all right.
3132000	3134000	Or I should see below that Loki's rim job.
3134000	3135000	Yes.
3136000	3137000	That's the joke.
3137000	3138000	Yep.
3138000	3142000	I like that Loki's rim job. I think you'd get a lot of, a lot of viewers.
3142000	3144000	But it doesn't really shout out mods.
3145000	3146000	OK, mod rim job.
3146000	3147000	I don't know.
3147000	3148000	Mod rim.
3148000	3149000	All right. Anyway.
3149000	3150000	OK, so my gaming week.
3151000	3155000	I actually, speaking of streaming, I had a great Overwatch stream last night at a lot of fun.
3155000	3160000	I was thinking on a Saturday night nobody would be watching, but I had a great stream last night on Overwatch, so that was a lot of fun.
3160000	3168000	Speaking of streaming, I will be focusing on, and I know not everybody's a fan of this, but this is a game I've been looking forward to for a very long time.
3168000	3176000	Stormblood, Final Fantasy XIV's newest expansion, launches on Friday, so I will be dedicating some serious hours to streaming Stormblood.
3176000	3183000	So those of you that kind of want to, you know, look at the game with me as I go through the story, I'll be doing a few hours on Friday and Saturday.
3183000	3193000	Obviously, with the OLR 15th next Sunday, it's going to be kind of busy, but I'm going to try to fit in, and then I go to Chicago on the Thursday next.
3193000	3198000	So, you know, I'm going to fit in as much as I can in that time, but I will be spending some serious hours on Stormblood.
3198000	3202000	But anyway, outside of that and streaming and everything, I did check out some new games this week.
3202000	3205000	Well, I guess this does tie back to streaming.
3205000	3207000	Sorry, but this is somebody else's stream.
3208000	3216000	Our pallet vog network, Flaco Jones, has been streaming a lot of Friday the 13th, and I watch enough of it because, you know, Flaco's a friend of mine.
3216000	3222000	I wanted to support him, and I was very happy he got affiliateship and all that, and he, you know, he does some funny stuff, an extrovert will join him sometimes.
3222000	3233000	He kind of got into playing a lot of the Friday the 13th game on PlayStation 4, and I was like, well, I think I might be sold on this, but I want to get it on PC because it seems like that's where everybody was at.
3233000	3238000	But it was seriously getting to the point where, like, he would be playing the game, and he'd be like, I wonder who's Jason, I wonder who's Jason.
3238000	3242000	I'd be like, push up, push up to see who Jason is, and that will show you.
3242000	3248000	He's like, I feel like, oh God, I'm backseat driving on a stream right now, which, you know, better me than a stranger, but still.
3248000	3251000	It got to the point where I was like, you know what, I just need to fucking buy this game.
3251000	3261000	And Flaco's birthday was over the weekend, and he was doing a birthday stream, and I was like, you know what, for Flaco's birthday, I'm going to buy a video game for myself.
3261000	3262000	How nice of you.
3262000	3263000	How nice of me.
3263000	3270000	So I bought Friday the 13th on PlayStation 4, but so I could play with Flaco and all of that, and why not?
3270000	3274000	It seems like pretty much, you know, the people I would play this with are on PlayStation 4.
3274000	3276000	So I finally bought the game on PlayStation 4.
3276000	3284000	I got in one round with him that night, and we, except I got killed first, because, and again, this was me being the backseat driver.
3284000	3293000	We all went for the car, and I'm like, never go for the car, because Jason is always at the car, because he knows everybody goes for the car.
3293000	3300000	And, but it was like, Xtavor had the keys, I had the gas, and Flaco had whatever else you need, the fuse or whatever else you need to get the car going.
3300000	3310000	So like, all three of us are running to the car, and since Xtavor and Flaco had played before, they got it ready to go, and I'm sitting there spilling gas all over the floor, because I can't do it, because I hadn't played the game before.
3310000	3315000	And then Jason shows up and murders me, and I'm like, and sure enough, we can't get the fucking car to start.
3315000	3319000	So, I mean, it was, I'm sure it was hilarious to watch, but that was frustrating.
3319000	3324000	But anyway, we will learn, and we will do better in the future with future games and so forth.
3324000	3333000	So there was that, but another game on PlayStation 4, I haven't really had a chance to do any streaming or talk about yet, but I did buy this game, and I've been playing it a little bit over the weekend.
3333000	3337000	Wipeout Omega Collection came out, and I was like, I like the Wipeout games.
3337000	3346000	I still don't have an F-Zero for this generation, so Wipeout is kind of my, well, Fast Racing Neo does this too, but Wipeout is my other little F-Zero substitute.
3346000	3360000	So if you didn't know, Wipeout Omega Collection is out on PlayStation 4, and it is a combination of the most recent two Wipeout games, although Wipeout on PlayStation 3 had like a full service expansion, so it's kind of three games.
3360000	3362000	I thought it was also like the Vita one as well.
3362000	3374000	It is. It's the Vita game, and then it's the two on PlayStation 3. And so it's that, but on PlayStation 4, and it's all kind of in one package, and just packaged as like one big game, sort of, even though there's like three different campaigns within it.
3374000	3383000	But I don't know what else to say. It's Wipeout, and it's pretty, and it's fast, and apparently it does like 4K and stuff on the Pro.
3383000	3398000	Since I have a PlayStation Pro, but I have an older TV, all I can say is that it's smooth. It's like butter. It's a very smooth, fast game, and it's fun. It's still Wipeout, so I'm enjoying playing that.
3398000	3405000	So I want to make more progress through some of the campaigns. I haven't even touched online or any of that stuff, but I was just happy to play some Wipeout.
3405000	3408000	So that was the other game I played this week, Wipeout Omega Collection.
3408000	3418000	Cool. All right. Housekeeping. So guess what? If you hadn't heard, even though we've been saying it a lot the past few weeks, but I know some folks are here tonight because of Z3 who haven't been listening in a while.
3418000	3428000	Next week, seven days from tonight, Orange Lounge Radio turns 15 years old. That's right, 15 years old. So our 15th anniversary show is next week.
3429000	3438000	And just stay tuned to social media throughout the week because we may be doing some special things throughout the week to kind of mark that 15 years old.
3438000	3450000	I would go so far as to say, again, the internet is a big place, but in 15 years, I have yet to find another. We will be the first gaming podcast to hit 15 years, consecutive years.
3450000	3458000	I'm not sure if any other show, any other podcast has hit 15 years. I'm not aware.
3458000	3459000	Well, podcasting has, but...
3459000	3469000	Yeah, and to be fair, to be fair, it started as a live internet show and then shifted into a podcast. So I realized there's some nuances there where I can't really say it's a 15 year old podcast because it's not.
3469000	3476000	But, you know, I still, I mean, are there a lot of internet shows out there that have been going for 15 years consecutively? No breaks.
3476000	3486000	So, you know, obviously a week here and a week there for holidays, but you guys know what I mean? Like, you know, we've been going for 15 years. So, yeah, so we're going to celebrate next week.
3486000	3495000	I'm not going to promise a big party or a celebration, but I will have Skype open a little longer next week. We're probably actually not going to be able to have it open too much tonight because of the Bethesda thing.
3495000	3497000	But next week, E3 wrap ups.
3497000	3507000	Well, yeah, but it'll be different cause we can kind of like solely focus on that and then we can move into, if you guys want to call, talk about OLR, talk about, you know, what the show has done for you or what you want to see from us in the next 15 years.
3507000	3521000	He, he, we can talk about that and that'll be fun. And Bobby and I have been talking behind the scenes about some things we want to do for VOG to that I think will be really good for the show's future and kind of like, you know, what'll, what'll happen in the next few years.
3521000	3530000	As more and more people are doing this video streaming thing, that's for sure. You know, where do we fit into that? So that'll be really exciting. So, yes, that is in seven days.
3530000	3538000	Also a long time OLR fan and, and she, she kind of comes out for the bigger shows. Misty is going to be here. Misty OLR will be here in studio.
3538000	3546000	I'm not sure of anybody else who says they will be here in person yet, but if you're interested in coming, if you're in the area, drop me a line and we can probably make that happen.
3546000	3556000	I should probably invite Gabe. I bet he would want to come for that episode cause he's put, he's, he's pushing again. I don't know if I'm supposed to talk about it, but I'm going to talk about it cause I didn't sign anything.
3556000	3566000	I'm getting a little, little preview of the release build of his game this week. So I know he's pushing that cause that's finally happening. So maybe he'll want to come talk about that now that that's about out.
3566000	3579000	So, all right. Anyhow, let's move on into some gaming news. Uh, you can always follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, facebook.com slash orange launch radio, but for now more news. Loki.
3579000	3593000	Yes. Uh, so they had this whole Pokemon Nintendo direct and they talked about, you know, some new stuff that's coming out and everyone's like, Oh shit, here comes the Pokemon game on the switch.
3594000	3606000	Well, yeah, it's a Pokemon game. I guess. Pokken tournament is heading to the switch. Pokken tournament deluxe. Woo. Five new fighters.
3606000	3614000	You know what? Okay. Here's the thing. You're not excited about that, but like act-deaf does a huge fan of Pokken. I know. And he's really excited about that. So this is kind of one of those things where it's like you're into it or you're not. You know what I mean?
3614000	3622000	No, Pokken tournament's fine. I'm just like, you know, we're adding five fighters for $60 basically.
3622000	3640000	But if you miss the Wii U as a lot of people did, and this is going to be your first Pokken game, then great. But I will say this for me, I did buy Pokken on the Wii U and I'm where you're at. I'm like, this isn't going to be enough for me to justify on the switch because I'm not that into Pokken, but cool for the people who are.
3640000	3655000	Yeah. So they've added five new players, as I mentioned. So they've got Dark Cry, Scizor, Empulim, Croagunk, and Decidueye. I probably butchered those.
3655000	3663000	They're also adding three versus three team battles ranked in group matches, and it's coming out on the switch on September 22nd.
3664000	3679000	Along with that, they're also launching some new 3DS Pokemon games. Pokemon Sun and Moon, they're getting the Ultra version. So Pokemon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon.
3679000	3687000	This sounds a little Black 2, White 2 to me. They haven't confirmed that that's the case, but that's the vibe I'm getting from these is that this is like Black 2, White 2.
3687000	3694000	Yeah. So they're saying that it's like an alternate storyline from the original and it's got some additional Pokemon as well. And those will be coming out on the 3DS.
3694000	3698000	November 17th, they're not coming out on the switch, which is kind of weird.
3698000	3702000	I'm thinking, though, that maybe they're going to announce something at E3.
3702000	3710000	No, no. I'm going to tell you right now, don't get your hopes up for that. Pokemon Company kind of does their own thing. Don't. If you're going into E3, go and they're going to wait and announce E3. Don't.
3710000	3718000	I mean, be pleasantly surprised if they do, but I'm telling you, not going to happen. Nintendo's only going for 30 minutes on Tuesday and this ain't there.
3718000	3725000	And you know what? That's okay. I mean, yeah, I think a lot of us had our hopes high because of this Pokemon Stars leak and all this stuff.
3725000	3731000	But the reality is, Pokemon tends to lag behind on the systems a little bit, at least for the mainline games.
3731000	3739000	This was true when the 3DS was well out on the market, doing fine, and yet they still released Black 2, White 2 on the DS.
3739000	3745000	But then again, the 3DS could play DS games, so it's also a little different. But I digress.
3745000	3751000	I don't think it's that big a deal that the Pokemon games did not skip to the switch. I think we all want to see it go there.
3751000	3759000	But they're going to have to go there eventually. Right now, Nintendo is pushing that new 2DS, or whatever they call it.
3759000	3764000	I can't remember the name of it anymore. But that thing, they are still pushing, so they need a game to kind of go with that.
3764000	3769000	So here you go. Among some other things, I mean, to be fair, there's other things in the DS universe that are happening as well.
3769000	3772000	So there you go. There's Pokemon still keeping that going.
3772000	3778000	And spoiler, you might want to just wait until holiday when they have a bundle with the new 2DS and that.
3778000	3784000	Oh, that's not a spoiler. That's inevitable. Come on. Alright. But okay, fine. I mean, that's fine.
3784000	3787000	I don't think there was any necessarily bad news in there.
3787000	3793000	No, it's just kind of disappointing. I mean, I'm not surprised.
3793000	3801000	Yeah. Alright, moving on. Let's talk about another game announcement from this week was the Mega Man Legacy Collection 2.
3801000	3810000	That's right. Mega Man Legacy Collection 2 is on its way out and it is going to be out on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
3810000	3816000	It's being released in August. It will be $20 and it contains Mega Man 7, 8, 9, and 10.
3816000	3822000	Mega Man 9 and 10, of course, a little bit newer. Those games were on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3
3822000	3827000	because that was kind of when Mega Man came back in its old 8-bit style. Remember those games, 9 and 10?
3827000	3833000	So that's a part of this. But of course, 7 and 8 were very different because they were not on the original NES.
3833000	3840000	They were on later systems. Well, 7 was on Super Nintendo and 8 was on PlayStation.
3840000	3845000	So these are all being packaged together into one thing. So that's kind of cool.
3845000	3851000	But it is starting to get very glaring that Capcom is omitting the Switch yet again.
3851000	3861000	And they did this with the Disney Afternoon Collection and now they're doing it again with the universe that people are most familiar with, with Mega Man.
3861000	3867000	Could it be because they're going to include all these games in their Netflix-style service and so it would be kind of stupid to sell it?
3867000	3877000	That's where my brain's going, is that maybe they are skipping the Switch because there's more money to be made on Virtual Console or perhaps the Netflix thing, whatever.
3877000	3883000	I mean, we still don't know what the hell the difference is, if there is one. I'm hoping we get some answers to that on Tuesday.
3883000	3891000	But again, I'm setting my bar at a very low level so that I don't get pissed off. And I suggest y'all do the same.
3891000	3904000	You know you're going to hear about Mario Odyssey. You know you're going to hear about Splatoon 2. Keep your bar low around there and you have a lot less room to get pissed off at something not being there.
3904000	3911000	Don't fucking expect Metroid. Don't expect F-Zero. Don't fucking do it because you're going to be mad. So why do that?
3911000	3917000	Just say, you know what, it's going to be 30 minutes of Super Mario Odyssey and then you're going to be happy with anything outside of that. Anything.
3917000	3931000	So, just a suggestion. But anyway, yeah, they are skipping Nintendo Switch and Nintendo 3DS. They're just saying, all Capcom's saying is, we're focusing on developing the game for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC.
3931000	3937000	There's no further information available on this subject at this time. So in other words, enough people are not complaining about it.
3937000	3951000	But, I mean, not that usually I'm one for Twitter campaigns, but I simply took the official Capcom announcement, did the quote tweet, and said, I'll buy it when it's on the Switch. And that's how I feel. I'll buy it when it's on the Switch.
3951000	3965000	Here's another thought to that. Could it be the cartridge prices? Because if you think about it, there's been a lot of games that'll come out for $19.99 on one platform and they're $39.99 on the Switch.
3965000	3969000	Eh, this isn't a cartridge release anyway. This is a digital release on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
3969000	3971000	Is it only digital?
3971000	3977000	Umm, it's got to be. For 20 bucks, it's got to be. I would feel confident in saying yes, it's only digital.
3977000	3978000	Hmm.
3978000	3979000	So.
3979000	3981000	Alright. Well, I thought that might be enough.
3981000	3982000	No, it's fine.
3982000	3984000	Because there's been a lot of games that have come out.
3984000	3989000	You win some, you lose some. I think your virtual console thing is something that this one is not.
3989000	4004000	It's confusing. So it's either got to be, it's got to be one of two things. Either this is this Netflix-type service, or it's because it's getting a physical release and the cartridges are fucking expensive, which is sad, but.
4004000	4014000	Let me say this quickly. I don't want to dive too far down this Nintendo rabbit hole, because let's be real, by the time a lot of you are hearing this, we could have some answers on this. Or we may not, I don't know.
4014000	4026000	But here's my thing. I get the sense that Nintendo's online classics thing is focusing on two-player games and head-to-head games. Why?
4026000	4035000	Because that's the big new draw here for these games is that you're going to be able to play Dr. Mario live against somebody via the Nintendo network.
4035000	4038000	And that's going to be the big draw as two-player. Mega Man's not a two-player game.
4038000	4052000	I think that if there is a virtual console, virtual console is going to focus on things like GameCube and Wii games and things that are so new that they're not really appropriate for this other service.
4052000	4061000	My gut tells me that's where the line is going to be drawn. We are going to have a virtual console, but it's going to be for really newer stuff. Ten years old type stuff.
4061000	4070000	To that though, and this is a general question because I don't know the answer to this. I don't think Wii games are going to work on it.
4070000	4081000	Because the thing about it, it doesn't have motion control really. I mean, one controller sort of does, but it doesn't have the sensor bar and stuff like that that the Wii U has.
4081000	4086000	It has support for that. But the Switch doesn't have that.
4087000	4090000	Those controllers have to be able to accomplish something similar.
4090000	4095000	It's very limited I think, so I don't know. I don't know if it can.
4095000	4103000	So by the way, YYR is correcting me in chat and sent me a link to a PlayStation 4 boxed version of Mega Man Legacy Collection 2.
4103000	4109000	So there is a physical version of it, but it's digital only on Xbox One. Isn't that interesting?
4109000	4111000	So it's physical, but only on PlayStation 4.
4111000	4112000	Weird.
4112000	4119000	But I'm sure it's both. Come on. Sony's not going to be like, oh you have to buy a physical. No way. No way. They get more money when you buy a digital.
4119000	4123000	So it'll be okay. I stand corrected. Good job YYR.
4123000	4127000	Alright, moving on to other game stuff from this week. Dark Sakura.
4127000	4132000	Well, we had a little bit of a peek into the new Kingdom Hearts.
4133000	4140000	I think it's going to be interesting though that they're going to be doing more of the release information of it at D23.
4140000	4147000	Which for those who don't know, that's like the big Disney con that is going to be going on in July.
4147000	4150000	We'll have to have Victoria look into that for us.
4150000	4155000	I know. I'm like, now I'm going to have to see if our pal Victoria can do any reporting for VOG there on the scene.
4155000	4159000	Because she's all over that D23 stuff. She's a big cosplayer for all that.
4160000	4168000	But at any rate, we don't really have a whole lot on it except really huge bosses and a little bit of the gameplay.
4168000	4174000	But I think it's going, well that and of course Sora does finally look a little bit older.
4174000	4180000	But I think it's going to be interesting to find out what that more is, you know?
4180000	4185000	I like the trailer. What little bit they were showing. That was cool.
4185000	4189000	I mean, in one way it's unfortunate that it's not at E3 this year.
4189000	4192000	Which means winter 2018 at the earliest at this point.
4192000	4195000	I'm sorry, I mean like November, December 2018 at the earliest at this point.
4195000	4197000	Yeah, I think it's at 2018.
4197000	4199000	I ain't going to hold my breath on that.
4199000	4202000	But anyway, here's where I start to get nervous.
4202000	4206000	Not just for this game, but Final Fantasy 7 Remake and all this stuff.
4206000	4210000	So Microsoft is now starting to push this 4K gaming thing.
4210000	4216000	There's a very distinct possibility depending on what happens this holiday with that thing.
4216000	4219000	There's a distinct possibility PlayStation 5.
4219000	4229000	Don't roll your eyes too heavy because depending on what happens with this 4K thing, PlayStation 5 could be announced next year.
4229000	4232000	I would say 2019 at the latest at this point.
4233000	4238000	So if these games get delayed much longer, they're going to miss the fucking boat.
4238000	4245000	Or they're going to have to go back and be developed more for what now the current console is at this time.
4245000	4249000	And then we get stuck in a fucking loop like we've had with Final Fantasy 15.
4249000	4254000	The development was so fucking slow on that game, they ended up having to make it for the next generation.
4254000	4256000	Because they couldn't finish it for the PlayStation 3.
4256000	4260000	I did notice one thing in here that I super like, just re-reviewing this.
4260000	4261000	Yeah.
4261000	4262000	The combo attacks.
4262000	4263000	Mhm.
4263000	4264000	The combo attacks look really neat.
4264000	4267000	It did look like Goofy and Donald might be useful.
4267000	4270000	Well, other than using up all my damn potions or whatever.
4270000	4271000	Yes.
4271000	4272000	Yeah.
4272000	4274000	But no, it looks really nice.
4274000	4276000	Yeah. No, the trailer's great if you haven't seen it yet.
4276000	4282000	But that was kind of their apology for, this is what you get, this is our E3, this is all we're saying now.
4282000	4283000	Oops.
4283000	4290000	But, maybe it goes without saying that they didn't do that for Final Fantasy 7 Remake.
4290000	4292000	Dot, dot, dot.
4292000	4295000	But again, I'm gonna temper my expectations on that.
4295000	4297000	I don't expect to see that at Sony's thing tomorrow.
4297000	4298000	Yeah.
4298000	4299000	I don't.
4299000	4300000	Who knows though?
4300000	4301000	Yeah. Who knows?
4301000	4302000	Alright.
4302000	4304000	Moving on, Loki.
4304000	4308000	In the category of things that nobody asks for.
4309000	4317000	And like, I remember that they had put out some remake of this shit and, or like remaster or something.
4317000	4318000	On Steam, I believe it was.
4318000	4320000	Yeah, a steaming pile of something.
4320000	4330000	So, Bubsy, The Woolies Strike Back, the trailer out of nowhere, the sequel that nobody asks for is making its way out.
4330000	4331000	Hold up.
4331000	4333000	Why is everybody hating on Bubsy?
4333000	4335000	I remember that game on Play, I own that game.
4335000	4337000	It's Bubsy 3D, it's Bubsy 3D's fault really.
4337000	4339000	Fuck Bubsy 3D for a minute.
4339000	4342000	You know what? Sometimes there's stinker games in series, okay?
4342000	4346000	Here's the thing, I own the original Bubsy on PlayStation 1.
4346000	4349000	I don't remember it being as particularly garbage as you all are saying it is.
4349000	4352000	In fact, for its time, it was a fine platformer.
4352000	4354000	It was one of like the platformers on PlayStation.
4354000	4361000	Yes, they fucked it hard with Bubsy 3D, but that's not what they're doing here.
4361000	4369000	So, all I'm saying is that, like, where's this fake outrage at Bubsy coming from?
4369000	4372000	Because I remember there was a time when Bubsy was actually pretty good.
4372000	4375000	And if we're going back to that, then alright, cool, give it a chance.
4375000	4383000	I mean, yeah, Bubsy's been gone for a long, long time and, you know, but, I don't know.
4383000	4386000	It seems like it's not the end of, you know, it's not the most horrible time.
4386000	4388000	It's alright. I mean, I don't know.
4388000	4391000	Not a game I'm interested in, but hey.
4391000	4395000	Yeah, so it's coming out on PlayStation 4 and PC this fall,
4395000	4400000	and it's actually kind of weird that it's coming out by developer Alkalaid,
4400000	4404000	which, shit, that was a developer that was around a long time ago.
4404000	4405000	They were around in the 80s.
4405000	4408000	Well, they were apparently the original developer of Bubsy.
4408000	4410000	They made the fucking Test Drive series back in the day.
4410000	4411000	Yes, they did.
4411000	4413000	That was their big thing, was Test Drive.
4414000	4418000	They made a game that I loved that next time Dark Sakura's absent
4418000	4420000	and I have to do the Classic Game of the Week, I'm picking this one.
4420000	4423000	Alkalaid Comics was a game that I fucking loved on 64.
4423000	4425000	Alright, as long as it's not Halo.
4425000	4427000	We know better at this point, Jamie.
4427000	4430000	But Alkalaid Comics was actually, I think you would actually really approve of this.
4430000	4432000	It was a really cool title on the Commodore 64.
4432000	4437000	So, yeah, those are Alkalaid games I can get into.
4437000	4441000	But yeah, Bubsy is interesting that that's coming back.
4441000	4444000	Now some folks in chat, okay, Eric RPG in chat says,
4444000	4446000	Rob is lying to himself or forgot how bad it was.
4446000	4447000	I'm not lying to myself.
4447000	4449000	It is possible I forgot how bad it was.
4449000	4454000	But I don't remember it being, I mean, yes, Bubsy 3D was fucking terrible.
4454000	4455000	But I'm not talking about that one.
4455000	4457000	I'm talking about the original ones.
4457000	4461000	Anyway, it's not worth arguing.
4461000	4463000	You know what, I'm going to pick and choose my battles
4463000	4465000	and the Bubsy battle is not one I feel like fighting.
4465000	4467000	I just don't.
4467000	4471000	So I'm going to move on and talk about another game that maybe we're going to see.
4471000	4475000	Oh, sorry, real quick, I wanted to mention one other thing regarding Bubsy.
4475000	4478000	That's not the only game that's going to be coming back from Alkalaid.
4478000	4481000	They're actually playing and releasing several games.
4481000	4482000	Test Drive?
4482000	4483000	Sadly not.
4483000	4488000	Hardball, Slave Zero, Deadlock, Eradicator, and Redline.
4488000	4491000	I know Hardball and that's like the only one on that list I know.
4491000	4493000	No, Redline, I remember that too.
4493000	4496000	I don't think Test Drive is something they can bring back because Atari has that.
4496000	4498000	Yeah, they do, they do.
4498000	4500000	And they really shit on that franchise.
4500000	4504000	Anyway, moving on to CD Projekt Red.
4504000	4506000	They've been working on a game.
4506000	4510000	They did The Witcher 3, obviously, which people went crazy over.
4510000	4513000	It was a very well artistically done game.
4513000	4517000	They've been working on a new game since then called Cyberpunk 2077.
4517000	4523000	Well, interesting, they tweeted out an announcement this week that kind of surprised some people.
4523000	4531000	And they said is that they had some documents stolen which contain designs for the upcoming game Cyberpunk 2077.
4531000	4536000	And these individuals have sent them ransom notices saying a demand for ransom has been made.
4536000	4539000	Saying that if they don't comply the files are going to be released to the general public.
4539000	4544000	CD Projekt Red has come out and said we don't give in to demands so we're not doing it.
4544000	4546000	And we've contacted the appropriate legal authorities.
4546000	4551000	And they're basically saying the documents are old and unrepresentative of the current vision for the game.
4551000	4556000	So only look for information to come from us that talks about the current vision of the game.
4556000	4560000	And there's a couple ways you can kind of take this.
4560000	4565000	There has been some serious problems out there recently with hacking and ransom demands.
4565000	4570000	And probably the most famous or well known case right now is Netflix was hacked.
4570000	4576000	And ten episodes from the most recent season of Orange is the New Black, which started on Friday,
4576000	4581000	were leaked like three months ago on the internet because Netflix did not comply with the ransom demands.
4581000	4586000	There are thirteen episodes in the season but I guess ten were done at the time they stole them or whatever.
4586000	4590000	So they all got leaked. So a lot of people saw those ten episodes a long time ago.
4590000	4592000	They're only standard definition too I think.
4592000	4595000	If they hang out and CD your places on the web.
4595000	4603000	But there's other people that are looking at this going oh ha ha it's a cyberpunk thriller game hacker game.
4603000	4608000	This is all a big, what do you fucking call those meta games?
4608000	4611000	No it's not ARG.
4611000	4616000	No ARG that's it. This is all big ARG and this is all to build hype for the game.
4616000	4620000	Here's the thing. In most cases I would think that would be pretty clever.
4620000	4624000	However CD Projekt specifically says in this announcement.
4624000	4629000	The documents are old and largely unrepresentative of the current vision of the game.
4629000	4633000	If this was all a gag to get you to look at what is released.
4633000	4637000	They would not be distancing themselves from the material like that.
4637000	4644000	To me that's what proves that this is something where unfortunately CD Projekt Red has found themselves in a Netflix like scenario.
4644000	4649000	But in my opinion good on them for not paying the people holding this ransom.
4649000	4655000	That's pretty fucking terrible in the day and age that we live in and just shows how important cyber security is.
4655000	4657000	Because people don't rob banks anymore.
4657000	4661000	They break into computers and then demand for ransom. That's what it is right?
4661000	4663000	So it sucks.
4663000	4668000	Dungeon Buster says ransomware is just getting worse. Unfortunately everyone wants bitcoins.
4668000	4670000	Boom. There you go.
4670000	4673000	Alright let's move on. Hopefully something a little more positive. DarkSakura?
4673000	4677000	Well one thing I am super excited about.
4677000	4685000	I'm sure that some of our people listening watched the Apple keynote from the developers conference.
4685000	4689000	Yeah it almost seems like a lifetime ago at this point. But yeah that was just this past week.
4689000	4697000	Yeah and honestly enough I was seriously more interested in a lot of that than what was going on in E3.
4697000	4703000	Because the big thing that stuck out to me and I actually had never considered that it would happen.
4703000	4708000	Is that they're working on VR for Mac OS.
4709000	4718000	They've already got developer kits going out for VR along with the kits going for $599.
4718000	4723000	And on the new operating system there's going to be support for external GPUs.
4723000	4726000	So this is going to be really good for developers.
4726000	4731000	And then on top of that we had the AR demo during the keynote.
4731000	4736000	Which was pretty fun. I mean watching people fall off the end of a table was kind of silly.
4736000	4740000	But then you know there's Metal 2 coming out.
4740000	4747000	All these systems are coming with much better graphics processors. Much better graphic cards.
4747000	4754000	And it just makes me think that I think gaming. People say I don't know who plays games on the Mac.
4754000	4759000	But I think it's really going to end up being a major contender down the line.
4759000	4763000	Well everybody. Well I shouldn't say everybody because some people own Android.
4763000	4768000	But a lot of people play games on Apple because of iPhone and iOS and that whole thing.
4768000	4769000	Games look really good.
4769000	4775000	I think everybody's kind of been sitting here going we're just waiting for Apple to kind of break the seal.
4775000	4781000	Like you know they started to kind of go there with Apple TV but they didn't really go all in for me.
4781000	4785000	But now you're right. When we're seeing some of this VR stuff it's starting to go okay.
4785000	4788000	So Apple is starting to dip their toe in here.
4788000	4794000	I think the dipping already happened because I mean like I said I'm playing.
4794000	4798000	I say dip the toe because where is the VR software for me to play and buy today.
4798000	4799000	It's in development now.
4799000	4801000	Right. So we're not there yet.
4801000	4805000	I'm referring more to gaming in general because I mean I'll put it this way.
4805000	4815000	I didn't mention it in my my gaming week but I've also got a Borderlands the pre sequel I've been playing on this little guy right here.
4815000	4819000	I've been playing and then I will play on an iMac.
4819000	4826000	I think I like is that I've been you know using the steam to save my game saves.
4826000	4829000	I pick up and play on any computer I want to.
4829000	4832000	I can just play it on my PC I can play it on my Mac.
4832000	4834000	Does Borderlands do the third person stuff.
4834000	4836000	How are you playing that without getting motion sick.
4836000	4838000	I play it in burst.
4838000	4839000	It's fun though.
4839000	4840000	Yeah.
4840000	4844000	But I mean I was how I was with Katamari Damacy.
4844000	4856000	You know but I'm just thinking that you know I think that that that stereotype is quite an outdated thought.
4856000	4865000	I think that it's people just holding on to an outdated concept that is quickly becoming quite the opposite.
4865000	4870000	Well here I my my biggest concerns is you know a system is always good as the games that are on it.
4870000	4874000	So we'll see what is delivered on this device after the development phase.
4874000	4879000	My other big concern is that Apple is not always known for doing things on the cheap.
4879000	4885000	So I mean you're going to need a beefy computer to play this that costs a lot of money through Apple.
4885000	4893000	So but if Apple can deliver the experience that's worth it if they can deliver the Rolls Royce of gaming experience then they can justify the Rolls Royce price.
4893000	4896000	So I'm not saying but I'm just saying that that is a concern to me.
4896000	4910000	And as also was mentioned in that same keynote that they have dropped the price for one of the new IMAX that are out right now as well as for the MacBook Pros.
4910000	4914000	Do those have any integrated cards in them because I mean this is their radiance.
4914000	4917000	Well this solution is an external card.
4917000	4925000	It's using the Thunderbolt port like you can add external cards using a Thunderbolt port but the enclosure itself is like six hundred dollars.
4925000	4930000	Well a lot of this right now is for development but that should be live like next year for the consumer.
4930000	4937000	And I would think by then you know the prices are only dropping on this technology by then it should be a little bit more affordable anyway.
4937000	4942000	And on top of that too you know how much do people spend on gaming PCs.
4942000	4953000	You know if a person wants it badly enough and I'll already put it this way you know I think that and this is just in my use.
4953000	4969000	I mean I think that I would rather pay more money and get something that I know number one is is a good machine and number two I'm not going to have to worry about replacing parts in all the time.
4969000	4976000	So you know I think this comment is said a little tongue in cheek but I actually think there's a lot more legit.
4976000	4979000	I think there's a big point in this in our chat from Bobby Black Wolf.
4979000	4993000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says now that Apple has invented VR and AR I see it getting more much more adoption with the masses just like how Apple invented the tablet touch screen computer eight years after Bill Gates held up a similar device and nobody cared.
4993000	5000000	So it's really only going to help you know you joke and you say that but are you wrong.
5000000	5008000	I mean to be fair Apple does have a way of making this shit look really really cool and like something you want Apple.
5008000	5015000	Yes they did and I they did a phone that was already done but they did it the Apple way and you had to have one.
5015000	5020000	So maybe maybe in a way this is the breakthrough VR needs.
5020000	5033000	I would think so because I mean now that I know I could just you know plug in on you know on my MacBook and take it with me and that it's going to have the processing power it needs for it.
5033000	5041000	I don't see a problem and I will probably get so motion sick I throw up all over everybody at Starbucks but hey it'll be a heck of a barf.
5041000	5042000	Yes it will.
5042000	5044000	Bobby in chat clarifies I'm not joking.
5044000	5045000	So all right there you go.
5045000	5049000	All right let's move on though for time again I get make sure we get through a lot of this stuff here.
5049000	5050000	So moving on Loki.
5050000	5056000	So remember we talked a little bit about how the creator of Super Meat Boy was teasing a new project.
5056000	5059000	Now we know a little bit more about what that project is.
5059000	5074000	It's actually an action adventure platformer game called The End is Nigh and yes it still also has kind of a similar art style to the other games like Super Meat Boy and The Binding of Isaac.
5074000	5076000	It's going to be available on Steam.
5076000	5082000	It looks like July 12th so they actually have a trailer out for it and you can check it out now.
5082000	5086000	But yeah it's very Super Meat Boyish.
5086000	5091000	I mean the it really really reminds me of that.
5091000	5093000	So check it out.
5093000	5094000	Good day.
5094000	5099000	Good to see what's finally come from them because I know we've been kind of waiting a little while to see what they were going to unveil.
5099000	5108000	So they're saying 600 plus levels 12 explorable chapters 20 collectibles 80 achievements and hundreds of collectible little squishy tumors.
5108000	5114000	I guess the game is this is the end is nice it's probably an adventure platformer game where the player takes control of Ash.
5114000	5123000	One of the few things that have survived the end of the world follow Ash as he flops through the future a pain and suffering feel his stress levels rise.
5123000	5134000	You throw him into endless swarms of decaying mutant animal like creatures and help aid his final epic quest to simply make a friend out of the people he pieces of people he finds along his journey.
5134000	5135000	All right.
5135000	5138000	Well one more thing before we get to the classic game of the week.
5138000	5144000	Remember how I said earlier that there's there's easier ways to steal people's money than robbing a bank these days.
5144000	5145000	Well guess what.
5145000	5148000	Another company has been breached by credit cards.
5148000	5151000	It may appear in its GameStop.
5151000	5158000	So GameStop actually sent letters to online customers informing them that credit card information may have been stolen.
5158000	5173000	So obviously this letter is out there so many blogs are getting a hold of it saying that credit card information to for anyone who quote placed or attempted to place older orders on our Web site from August 10th 2016 to February 9th 2017.
5173000	5175000	So you know last Christmas.
5175000	5177000	You know when you're placing switch orders.
5177000	5178000	Yes.
5178000	5180000	So this is not good.
5180000	5183000	So it looks like that may have been breached.
5183000	5193000	So they have to notify because you get an email attempted to place an order during that time period and used a payment card ending in you know whatever it is confirming that your card is potentially in the list there.
5193000	5201000	GameStop identified and addressed a potential security incident that was related to transactions made it made on GameStop's Web site during a specific period of time.
5201000	5208000	GameStop mailed notification letters to customers who made purchases during that time frame advised him of the incident and providing information on steps they can take.
5208000	5211000	That was a statement they said about those letters.
5211000	5214000	And you know this is not good news for GameStop.
5214000	5217000	It's our industry is starting to go a little more and more digital.
5217000	5225000	And as retailers are getting you know less and less business because of online a lot more people are shopping online these days.
5225000	5228000	And you just ask Sears Montgomery Ward Montgomery Ward.
5228000	5234000	Well well them Macy's the one I was trying to think of the Sears Macy's and all these places they're closing.
5234000	5238000	You know the last Kmart in Sacramento is going to close.
5238000	5239000	That's right.
5239000	5240000	All right.
5240000	5241000	All right.
5241000	5243000	Where are we going to get our 80s fashions.
5243000	5244000	Auburn.
5244000	5245000	You have to go to Kmart in Auburn.
5245000	5247000	Be open.
5247000	5251000	If you still need your raucous do caucus shirts.
5251000	5253000	Well they'll be available up in Auburn.
5253000	5254000	All right.
5254000	5256000	So yeah.
5256000	5268000	Not good news for GameStop especially hot off the heels of the whole you know circle of life thing that came around a few months ago where you know they were really pushing you know the trades and the preorders and all that.
5268000	5269000	All right.
5269000	5274000	Anyhow I'm going to chat over at live dot vog network dot com.
5274000	5277000	Act Deaf is pointing out speaking of reservations.
5277000	5279000	Forza Motorsport 7 is up on Amazon.
5279000	5280000	Of course.
5280000	5282000	Of course they want you to drop those preorders on games you just saw.
5282000	5283000	Did you see.
5283000	5284000	Did you see they so.
5284000	5285000	Hey guess what.
5285000	5287000	Available now to preorder.
5287000	5290000	No available now in the Xbox store.
5290000	5292000	You can go preorder them digitally.
5292000	5297000	Why would you ever want to preorder a digital game.
5297000	5299000	Maybe there's a bonus.
5299000	5301000	That's that's what it's all about these days.
5301000	5302000	But yeah I know.
5302000	5306000	I mean like oh my God there might not be enough copies.
5306000	5308000	I might not get one.
5308000	5310000	All right.
5310000	5313000	Let's let's travel to a simpler time.
5313000	5316000	Let's go back to a time when it's like you know what.
5316000	5317000	You don't get digital.
5317000	5322000	There's no that maybe you have a 300 baud modem and that's it.
5322000	5326000	Maybe you can't afford a modem because the technology is still right.
5326000	5327000	That's right.
5327000	5330000	You still have to turn a crank if you want to call it BBS.
5330000	5341000	Your your modem was a pink box that had two rubber divots on it that you put your phone receiver on to.
5341000	5343000	And it called shit.
5343000	5344000	The Sega Channel.
5344000	5346000	Yes.
5346000	5347000	All right.
5347000	5348000	It's the classic game of the week.
5348000	5358000	But in a 2017 twist Dark Sakura once a month likes to spotlight an entire system that she thinks hey stop neglecting this system.
5358000	5359000	That had no internet.
5359000	5367000	And especially this week when we're all focused on you know the switches and the Xbox One X and the PlayStation fours.
5367000	5368000	We need.
5368000	5371000	Let's not forget this system of classic.
5371000	5373000	This one is rather precious to my childhood.
5373000	5374000	All right.
5374000	5375000	So what is the classic system of the week.
5375000	5381000	The magnet the Magnavox Odyssey 2 or I would say Odyssey squared the way it's written but Odyssey 2.
5381000	5385000	In Europe it was called the Philips video pack G7000.
5385000	5388000	In Brazil it was the Philips Odyssey.
5388000	5391000	But you know I grew up with it as Odyssey 2.
5391000	5399000	There had been a first Odyssey system in 1970s.
5399000	5405000	These noises don't don't trigger at all with this game.
5405000	5415000	Anyway the system was released in 1978.
5415000	5420000	So it was like it was old school.
5420000	5421000	It was old school.
5421000	5427000	Now in the U.S. we got it in 1979 but it was first released in Europe.
5427000	5431000	And I played one of these when I was a teensy kid.
5431000	5433000	I'll put it that way.
5433000	5441000	But anyway one of the neat things about it is that it did play on the original Odyssey.
5441000	5449000	Probably the original Odyssey design that had removable circuit cards that would let you switch between built in games.
5449000	5458000	Now this one the Odyssey 2 it all had its own individual video game cartridges.
5458000	5467000	And the neat thing about it with this is that it also allowed for background graphics, foreground graphics.
5467000	5471000	It had all kinds of different things going on that were kind of new at the time for how they were.
5471000	5476000	It also used the joystick design that was very popular in the 70s and 80s.
5476000	5481000	And not like the bizarreness that was the ColecoVision controller later on.
5482000	5484000	Okay stop for a moment.
5484000	5492000	Why did mid to late 80s machines have the worst controllers ever?
5492000	5494000	When the joystick is so perfect.
5494000	5496000	Why?
5496000	5500000	What is it about the 80s that made people lose their shit when it came to controller design?
5500000	5502000	I just figured it was new. People didn't know what to do.
5502000	5506000	We're gonna put a phone pad on it. Thanks Coleco.
5506000	5513000	Anyway, but the joystick for this was very simple. You had your button, you had your joystick. That's all you needed.
5513000	5515000	And we liked it.
5515000	5525000	One of the other neat things though about this system is that it had a speech synthesis unit too.
5525000	5528000	Which was pretty neat for its time, you know.
5528000	5533000	And one of the things like what we're listening to right now is a game.
5534000	5536000	And I've done the game before for Classic Game.
5536000	5538000	It's Quest for the Rings.
5538000	5541000	Where you had a board game that you played along with a video game.
5541000	5545000	Although we would always just say fuck the board game and just play the video game.
5545000	5547000	Because playing the changeling was always the fun part.
5547000	5550000	That's like playing the Clue VCR game. Fuck the game, let's just watch the dumb movie.
5550000	5553000	Just watch the Clue movie that doesn't have Tim Curry.
5555000	5561000	And there were a few other games that were like Conquest of the World and The Great Wall Street Fortune Hunt.
5561000	5563000	And each of them were like that too.
5563000	5573000	And I will say the Atari 2600, the Intellivision, its other competitor at the time was the Bally Astrocade.
5573000	5576000	Which I might go in for a system one.
5576000	5581000	But this one, it had a pretty decent market share.
5581000	5583000	It was the third runner, but it wasn't bad, you know.
5583000	5587000	In the US, it sold pretty well.
5588000	5596000	And it was actually one of the main ones that was selling pretty well right before 1982.
5596000	5603000	Over a million, by 1983, over a million Odyssey 2 units were sold in just the US.
5603000	5605000	And like I said, it was all over the world.
5605000	5613000	There were no third party games until 1983, which was Imagic's Demon Attack.
5613000	5618000	So that really did limit what it could do with the lack of third party support.
5618000	5621000	Pay attention to Nintendo sometimes.
5621000	5634000	But then again, you know, there were other releases like Popeye, Frogger, Qbert, Super Cobra, and then Atlantis where there were some other big ones.
5634000	5642000	As far as international releases, it did get released in Japan as the Odyssey 2.
5642000	5646000	It was kind of successful. Not very.
5646000	5650000	And finding a Japanese Odyssey 2 is actually really difficult.
5650000	5653000	It had a decent release in Brazil.
5653000	5656000	They had tournaments for Casey's Crazy Chase.
5656000	5658000	It was called ComCom there.
5658000	5667000	And then in Europe, of course, it sold very well with a much larger number of games that were released in Europe.
5667000	5674000	The only thing that was interesting about the European models is that they didn't have any power buttons.
5674000	5677000	And that their action buttons on the joysticks were black.
5677000	5679000	Which is kind of odd, but hey.
5679000	5686000	Anyway, it had an 8-bit Intel 8048 microcontroller.
5686000	5691000	It ran at a blazing 1.79 megahertz.
5691000	5694000	64 bytes of RAM.
5694000	5697000	Audio RAM was 128 bytes.
5697000	5702000	BIOS ROM was 1024 bytes.
5702000	5705000	I mean, keep in mind, this is bytes.
5705000	5709000	This is the 70s and the 80s.
5709000	5713000	But it was so much fun, you know.
5713000	5718000	There actually is an emulator out there for people who are interested in it.
5718000	5723000	The open source emulator right now is called O2EM.
5723000	5727000	It also has the video pack emulation for the other games.
5727000	5731000	I mean, it's out for all of the big systems out there.
5731000	5739000	But, you know, if you want to get into basically what I spent my formative years playing, you know, this is it.
5739000	5745000	Now, we used to have mirror matches playing some of the racing games.
5745000	5749000	Like, where we would quite literally look in a mirror and try to play.
5749000	5752000	Oh, that's such a dumb five-year-old thing to do, but I love it.
5752000	5758000	It was great. And the game that I was actually really good at, what was it called?
5758000	5759000	Cryptequip?
5759000	5760000	Yeah, yeah.
5760000	5761000	Where it was the word scrabble game.
5761000	5762000	Yeah.
5762000	5764000	And then, you know, there was Hangman.
5764000	5766000	But, man, I loved that.
5766000	5768000	God, why can't I remember the name of the racing game?
5768000	5770000	Because I fucking loved the racing game.
5770000	5774000	And it was almost like, you know, a little just, you know, lap trap thing.
5774000	5776000	But we played a lot of Quest for the Rings.
5776000	5778000	A lot of Quest for the Rings.
5778000	5784000	And we would just play for hours with these little blocky looking weird people.
5784000	5787000	And this, it was kind of a dragon. It was Trogdor.
5787000	5789000	It was an 8-bit Trogdor.
5789000	5791000	You just like to burn an 8.
5791000	5797000	Oh, it was great. But, man, you know, I will say this here.
5797000	5801000	We didn't have a 2600. None of my friends had one.
5801000	5802000	Wow.
5802000	5807000	My ex-asshole stepdad, well, he was an asshole still.
5807000	5813000	But my ex-stepdad, his friend had an Atari 2600.
5813000	5815000	And I would go play that sometimes.
5815000	5822000	But this, the Odyssey 2, I played so much more than an Atari 2600.
5822000	5827000	I probably played more Atari 2600 as an adult than I did as a child.
5827000	5828000	Hmm.
5829000	5834000	But, yeah, this was the one that was big for me, was the Odyssey 2.
5834000	5835000	All right.
5835000	5836000	Hey.
5836000	5840000	There it is, your classic system of the month, the Odyssey 2.
5840000	5843000	And I must confess, a system I have not really spent a lot of time with.
5843000	5844000	I have one.
5844000	5846000	You should bring one over. It'll be fun.
5846000	5848000	You don't have a TV that it'll connect to.
5848000	5852000	Oh, is there a box that can convert the signal to HDMI?
5852000	5853000	There's got to be.
5853000	5858000	I have a VHF to UF converter, a VHS, no.
5858000	5859000	VHS.
5859000	5860000	What am I saying?
5860000	5861000	No, I know what you mean.
5861000	5863000	The little, the coaxial thingy, because of the old.
5863000	5864000	Yeah.
5864000	5865000	Yeah, it's a coax to HDMI, basically.
5865000	5872000	But this one ran off of, if I remember right, it was the little hook that you screwed them into.
5872000	5873000	The RF.
5873000	5874000	Yeah.
5874000	5875000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5875000	5881000	We've got a converter that we've been using to run the 5200s on that.
5881000	5882000	So I'll have to find one.
5882000	5885000	Actually, isn't there something about, like, these games won't even really play on an HDMI?
5885000	5887000	Because there's something, I don't know what it is.
5887000	5894000	They come out looking like, well, especially on top of that, you really did have, you know, still crazy flicker.
5894000	5897000	You know, they didn't run very quickly.
5897000	5905000	And these screens will try to, like, do, like, some sort of upscaling to it that just makes it kind of a blurry effect.
5905000	5913000	And when, like, even for our NES, when we hook it up to our TV, there's probably a two second delay in what you do and what you see.
5913000	5920000	That's why when we were live streaming and I was trying to play Guardian Legend, I couldn't play.
5920000	5923000	The delay was just way too terrible.
5923000	5928000	So I'm actually, I'm actually, like, Googling, like, play Atari 2600 on HDTV.
5928000	5933000	Because, I mean, I just figure more people are going to be looking at Atari 2600 because that was the system there.
5933000	5939000	But some people are saying here, like, I guess I got, I got looped over to a forum or something like that.
5939000	5941000	And people are saying everything will work fine.
5941000	5945000	The RCA is interchangeable. The AV inputs on your TV are not good ideas.
5945000	5948000	They're not going to pick up the signal, but there's no harm on your TV.
5948000	5950000	But there might be a little lag, it sounds like.
5950000	5953000	Yeah, the lag is the worst part of it for me.
5953000	5957000	But I did notice, like, some blurring, you know, a little bit of blurring.
5957000	5961000	So, and it just could just be that it's so much smoother, you know.
5961000	5962000	All right.
5962000	5964000	Okay, well, we're going to take a break.
5964000	5969000	But when we come back, there is more of Orange Lounge Radio to come, including rapid fire news, what's in stores this week.
5969000	5974000	And we'll get to a few more news stories, hopefully all before 9 o'clock and the Bethesda press conference.
5974000	5977000	I think some of you guys are going to be watching as E3 continues.
5977000	5978000	Don't go anywhere, guys.
5978000	5981000	We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5987000	5990000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5990000	5995000	Live tonight, episode 690 of our show for this June the 11th of 2017.
5995000	6002000	We're having a fun show so far. E3 is underway and there's some good, some not so good.
6002000	6005000	But, you know, at least there's something to be excited about somewhere.
6005000	6007000	It's a great time to be a gamer.
6007000	6009000	It's always funny because everybody likes to ask that question.
6009000	6012000	Who won E3 this year? Who is the big winner?
6012000	6016000	Well, ultimately, if gamers aren't the winner, then we had a bad show.
6016000	6020000	They haven't been really blown, like, knocked out of park.
6020000	6026000	Okay, but everybody's hoping for another thing where Sony just fucking drags Microsoft by the hair
6026000	6028000	and pulls them through the parking lot.
6028000	6034000	Honestly, I would like to see something from Sony to that effect
6034000	6038000	because right now it seems like the dragging is being done by Microsoft right now.
6038000	6040000	Well, come on, Logie.
6040000	6044000	Microsoft's had a turn and Sony hasn't. It's way too early to say that.
6044000	6047000	But I want to see something I like from everybody.
6047000	6052000	I would like to see games with trailers that are actually coming out this year
6052000	6057000	instead of games that they showed us for the last four years that are, oh yeah, you know?
6057000	6059000	Fair enough, fair enough.
6059000	6062000	Alright, we're going to get into some rapid fire news here
6062000	6066000	and before too long we'll be getting your calls at Orange Launch Radio on Skype.
6066000	6068000	But as a reminder, it may be a little bit of a shorter show tonight
6068000	6072000	because, well, we were thinking that Bethesda was going to interrupt the show
6072000	6074000	and I just found out today they weren't.
6074000	6078000	So, whoops, I guess bad planning on my part, but that's alright.
6078000	6080000	I know it's a busy week for you guys.
6080000	6082000	So let's get into rapid fire news. Logie.
6082000	6086000	So, I'm a little frustrated by this news
6086000	6089000	and the reason why, you may remember Volition.
6089000	6092000	They're the makers of Saints Row, that series.
6092000	6095000	But now they have a new game called Agents of Mayhem that's coming out.
6095000	6098000	It's a different game. It's not Saints Row.
6098000	6101000	It's not supposed to be Saints Row.
6101000	6104000	But now it's Saints Row. But now it's like Saints Row.
6104000	6109000	Because, like, seriously, they're like, okay, yeah, it doesn't necessarily...
6109000	6112000	It's like, maybe in the same universe.
6112000	6115000	Like, you know, the Saints stuff is kind of there.
6115000	6118000	And then now they pull this shit.
6118000	6124000	Basically, as a pre-order bonus, you get a playable character of Johnny Gat.
6124000	6126000	And apparently it's supposed to be within canon
6126000	6130000	because Gat is back from, you know, after the events from Gat Out of Hell.
6130000	6134000	He fell into a coma and woke up in this world.
6134000	6140000	Okay. But that just pisses me off more that there's not a fucking new Saints Row game.
6140000	6143000	And there's this. But it's not Saints Row.
6143000	6147000	But if this has the humor of Saints Row, wouldn't you still be okay with it?
6147000	6152000	No, because they wanted me to be okay when Saints Row was like a superhero game.
6152000	6156000	It's not a superhero game. It was a knockoff of Grand Theft Auto.
6156000	6160000	Like, okay, you are fucking kidding yourself if you don't think you're giving this game a chance.
6160000	6162000	And buy it when it comes out. Come on.
6162000	6164000	No, I don't know. I wasn't really interested in it.
6164000	6166000	Oh, my God. All right.
6166000	6168000	It's got Johnny Gat in it, though.
6168000	6170000	Surprised we didn't see it today, actually.
6170000	6175000	I would have thought the Microsoft thing would have been a place to show this, but I guess not.
6175000	6179000	I mean, I don't know. It's all right. It's just, it's kind of silly.
6179000	6184000	I mean, I guess that's what Saints Row is, but it just seems cheap.
6185000	6187000	I don't know. I don't know what to think of it.
6187000	6189000	All right. Let's move on.
6189000	6191000	And then this is kind of cool.
6191000	6198000	So there's this game that came out called Jazzpunk that's a pretty silly first person puzzle game.
6198000	6203000	And they're finally getting DLC for it, which is weird because it came out like three years ago.
6203000	6209000	And now they're finally putting out some DLC in the form of a director's cut that's coming.
6210000	6215000	They're saying that's Flavor Nexus is the expansion pack that's coming out.
6215000	6222000	And yeah, I mean, I guess, I don't know. I'm down for that because I actually like Jazzpunk.
6222000	6228000	I need to go back and finish it, but it's a really strange, like, I don't really know how to describe it.
6228000	6232000	It's kind of like a James Bond-ish type game, but it's not.
6232000	6237000	It's like really like weird humor, but it's definitely worth checking it out.
6237000	6242000	Dungeon Muster knows this game in chat over at live.vognetwork.com and says, LOL, it was such a funky game.
6242000	6246000	It is. It's a really weird game. It's really worth checking out.
6246000	6248000	But hey, DLC this long after the fact.
6248000	6249000	Yeah, I'll pick it up.
6249000	6253000	What a way to remind people about your game and kind of give it a second life, right?
6253000	6254000	Right.
6254000	6255000	That's pretty cool.
6255000	6259000	All right. Anyhow, Housemarque is giving away a game on Steam
6259000	6262000	because they're trying to promote their next release, Next Machina.
6262000	6265000	So they are giving away one of their older games.
6265000	6270000	You might know them from Resogun and Super Stardust, but this is something they're giving away on Steam.
6270000	6274000	It's Outland, so you can find that available on Steam.
6274000	6281000	That is going to be, I think that you can only do that through, when was it? Oh, is that already done?
6281000	6286000	Never mind. Time's up. Well, this was a timely announcement, wasn't it?
6286000	6287000	Sorry.
6287000	6289000	So guess what? You missed a free game.
6289000	6290000	Shame.
6290000	6292000	Maybe, sorry about that.
6292000	6297000	Maybe you should follow CheapAssGamer because you'll get notified a lot.
6297000	6302000	Or one of those people that do the updates regularly on those game sales.
6302000	6307000	But well, you know what? Hey, it's still a reminder that they do have this new game coming out
6307000	6309000	and it's something they're highlighting at E3.
6309000	6314000	And hey, who gives away games to support their upcoming release?
6314000	6315000	I mean, you don't hear about that every day.
6315000	6318000	It's not the first time that's been done, but you don't hear about that every day.
6318000	6320000	Usually you have to pre-order that to get it.
6320000	6325000	Anyhow, moving on to this one I'm very excited about.
6325000	6333000	There was a trailer that was released this past week for Dissidia Final Fantasy NT coming to PlayStation 4.
6333000	6338000	This, of course, Dissidia being the Final Fantasy fighting title, but I believe...
6338000	6339000	Is this the arcade one?
6339000	6343000	Yeah, pretty much. It's going to be the arcade one, but now on PlayStation 4.
6343000	6344000	I'm down.
6344000	6349000	They released these games on PSP a long time ago, so it's kind of like one of those...
6349000	6355000	It's about fucking time we get this on PlayStation 4, especially with how well this has been doing in the arcades.
6355000	6360000	So it will be coming out in early 2018, although we don't have a direct day yet.
6360000	6366000	But there is supposed to be some type of press event at the E3 Coliseum on June 13th of 3.15
6366000	6370000	and I'm going to assume they are showing more about this game at that time.
6370000	6379000	Of course, if you see the trailer, it's very Square Enix, very Final Fantasy, over-the-top, opera singers, all that pomp and circumstance.
6379000	6383000	And it's great. I can't wait to get this game because I've been wanting to play it.
6383000	6387000	You can't really find this in arcades around here. I don't even think round one has it.
6387000	6392000	DungeonBuster says, can you fight as Final Fantasy XV's flying car?
6392000	6399000	No, but I think they put in Noctis as a down-low or some type of character after the fact.
6399000	6405000	Because you know that a lot of Japanese arcade games now are just like mobile games on fucking steroids.
6405000	6410000	So it's like, you know, they patch it in.
6410000	6413000	Yeah, a lot of it. You have cards that remember who you are.
6413000	6419000	I thought some of them used your cell phone, but I guess somebody figured out that the cards make more money or something, I don't know.
6419000	6421000	But yeah, pretty cool.
6421000	6424000	Moving on, DarkSakura.
6424000	6428000	Well, Shenmue 3, of course, we know it made its Kickstarter.
6428000	6432000	But we haven't really found out too much since then.
6432000	6436000	So we had it on the news delivered by Yu Suzuki himself.
6436000	6443000	He said that they must delay the release because the game has become bigger and more beautiful than initially expected.
6443000	6447000	So it set back for the end of 2018.
6447000	6451000	Highly anticipated game gets delayed. What a shock, right?
6451000	6453000	At least it wasn't butchered like Mighty No. 9.
6453000	6457000	That makes a perfect candidate for a trailer at the Sony press conference, right?
6457000	6459000	I guess, but why...
6459000	6461000	I would rather wait for something good.
6461000	6463000	Yeah, I would rather wait till next year's conference.
6463000	6466000	Well, that's what I'm saying is because they tend to put trailers out for games that aren't coming out for a while.
6466000	6467000	Oh, I see.
6467000	6472000	It was a cerebral joke that went over my head, I'm sorry.
6472000	6475000	And in other news, PlayStation...
6475000	6480000	Well, Sony is a sponsor for London Pride this year.
6480000	6488000	So the PlayStation UK posted the hashtag for all capital A-L-L, the players.
6488000	6491000	So I think that that's pretty good. We need...
6491000	6494000	Wish they'd do it for more things here.
6494000	6500000	But hey, that's going to be for London Pride, which is July 8th.
6500000	6502000	Yay.
6502000	6506000	Yeah, that's awesome that Sony is getting involved with that.
6506000	6507000	Good guy, Sony.
6507000	6514000	So to be fair, though, Microsoft gets involved with these types of causes quite frequently as well.
6514000	6518000	Don't think I've seen Nintendo.
6518000	6524000	I'm using a big question mark with that because I'm trying to think.
6524000	6527000	Didn't Nintendo sponsor GamerX4?
6527000	6529000	They might have.
6529000	6531000	So anyway, but you know what I mean.
6531000	6533000	They just see them as often, but it's still cool.
6533000	6535000	All right.
6535000	6540000	JD in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Nintendo likes to avoid gay entirely.
6540000	6543000	Case in point, Tomodachi life.
6543000	6548000	Yeah, but didn't Nintendo kind of fess up that they made a mistake there?
6548000	6552000	I'm a lot better with it when a company says,
6552000	6559000	sorry, we'll do better next time than, well, fuck off type of thing.
6559000	6561000	There's kind of one or two ways that can go, right?
6561000	6564000	So if a company says sorry and we'll do better next time,
6564000	6568000	I'm willing to stop attacking them over it, if that makes sense.
6568000	6570000	But anyway, let's move on.
6570000	6574000	On to happier news. What can we find in stores this week? Loki?
6574000	6576000	Not a whole lot, to be honest.
6576000	6582000	So we've got Cars 3 Driven to Win, the franchise game for the movie coming out on this Friday.
6582000	6590000	So we've got it on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360, the Nintendo Switch, and the Wii U.
6590000	6594000	And then finally, one other game coming out on the Switch this week.
6594000	6599000	Arms is making its way out on Friday. That's it.
6599000	6602000	Oh my God, that's right. Arms is this week, huh?
6602000	6603000	Yeah.
6603000	6606000	There's some people I know that are very, very, very excited about that, that's for sure.
6606000	6610000	All right, well, my website where I do the Japanese releases is having some issues.
6610000	6614000	So let's go over, can we go to the UK ones real quick?
6614000	6618000	Sure. There are some UK releases.
6618000	6623000	On the 14th, we have Pixel Heroes, Byte and Magic, because I thought it was a cool name.
6623000	6627000	And on the 15th, MotoGP 17. That's it.
6627000	6631000	All right. Unfortunately, I am not able to tell you what's coming out in Japan this week.
6631000	6634000	So I'm going to have to table that to a later time.
6634000	6635000	Stuff.
6635000	6638000	Yeah, more stuff. Yeah, I'm not getting my list that usually comes up.
6638000	6640000	So that's okay. Websites go up and they go down.
6640000	6644000	So yeah, please look forward to it.
6644000	6646000	Yeah, look forward to it.
6646000	6651000	Surprise things they announced during E3 this week. That's what's going to be coming out of Japan.
6651000	6654000	Sorry, guys. All right, moving on.
6654000	6656000	We're going to go ahead and skip over the mailbag this week.
6656000	6659000	But we do want to encourage you guys to email us in the future.
6659000	6662000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6662000	6664000	Just we're skipping it for time tonight.
6664000	6667000	Remember, our 15th anniversary show is next week.
6667000	6668000	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
6668000	6672000	So if you're one of those longtime listener, first time caller type of people, we'd really love to hear from you.
6672000	6675000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6675000	6678000	Not to give you a guilt trip or anything.
6678000	6680000	Stare.
6680000	6682000	Puppy dog eyes.
6682000	6683000	All right.
6683000	6685000	I'm not going to have a floofy dress, though.
6685000	6687000	No, no Kisenyara dress, unfortunately.
6687000	6691000	Maybe I'll pick up little plastic tiaras.
6691000	6693000	That would be fun. That would be fun.
6693000	6694000	All right, moving on.
6694000	6703000	I did talk about possibly doing a video stream of the 15th anniversary, but I'm not going to have the expense invested in the studio to be able to do that.
6703000	6709000	But please know that is something I'm looking at for the near future, maybe episode 700 or something.
6709000	6711000	So that we can have something.
6711000	6714000	I know Jamie doesn't want to be on cam, but we can figure something out.
6714000	6716000	It could happen.
6716000	6718000	She just has to have proper warning.
6718000	6721000	I'll do the Sia thing with the wig that covers my eyes.
6721000	6723000	I love it. You should.
6723000	6728000	You should. You know what? You should get a hat that says something.
6728000	6730000	It doesn't say something.
6730000	6732000	That's right. Get a hat that says something.
6733000	6738000	It'll say something. Literally. S-O-M-E-T-H-I-N-G.
6738000	6741000	How many fucking guys that dress up in drag do you know?
6741000	6744000	Like, you've got to know somebody that has a hat that says something.
6744000	6745000	Girl.
6745000	6746000	Exactly.
6746000	6748000	It's like I turn around and there's a queen.
6748000	6749000	Oh, hi.
6749000	6751000	You just need to get a Carmen Sandiego fedora.
6751000	6754000	I think she should change it up every week.
6754000	6756000	She should have a big hat every week that's like changing.
6756000	6758000	One week she has a Carmen Sandiego fedora.
6758000	6760000	One week she has a Sia wig.
6760000	6762000	I mean, this could get expensive, but it's funny.
6762000	6763000	Fuck.
6763000	6765000	Who was it that...
6765000	6767000	Oh, shit. Now I'm thinking of a show.
6767000	6770000	Where you used to have like different glasses or something every week.
6773000	6774000	Dame Edna.
6774000	6775000	Is that who you're thinking of?
6775000	6776000	No. Wasn't Dame Edna.
6776000	6777000	Hello, my puppets!
6777000	6780000	Dame Edna's always had the Reinstein cat eyeglasses.
6780000	6782000	Is anyone in chat old enough to know who Dame Edna is?
6782000	6783000	Probably not.
6783000	6784000	Dame Edna ever...
6784000	6787000	I'm betting JD. JD would know who Dame Edna is, if anybody.
6787000	6791000	Although I do have some problems with Dame Edna lately for having some very translated things.
6791000	6796000	That's true. Sorry. I forgot that she has definitely put her foot up her fucking mouth recently.
6796000	6798000	So, sorry about that. I forgot.
6798000	6803000	I like to remember a Dame Edna from the 70s that was a lot different.
6803000	6804000	Yeah.
6804000	6805000	Yes.
6805000	6806000	All right.
6806000	6809000	Anyhow, movie... JD says, I've read about Dame Edna.
6809000	6811000	Yeah, probably those same stories you're referring to.
6811000	6813000	Anyway, moving on.
6813000	6817000	Let's get to some other news stories to end things out.
6817000	6818000	Loki.
6818000	6820000	So, things are definitely changing with Pokemon Go.
6820000	6825000	So, we kind of hinted at a few things that might be happening through speculation and stuff.
6825000	6828000	But now, we kind of have a little bit of something more concrete.
6828000	6834000	So, we know that the gym system is going to be redone because the gyms are going offline shortly.
6834000	6837000	So, they're going to be doing an event soon on June 13th.
6837000	6841000	It's the Solstice event. So, they're going to be doing extra XP for players.
6841000	6846000	Not only that, but they're going to be adding more fire and ice type Pokemon.
6846000	6849000	Finally, I can involve my stupid Charmeleon, who'll be nice.
6849000	6852000	Also, they're going to reduce the price of Lucky Eggs.
6852000	6856000	So, if you want to quadruple your XP, you can do that.
6856000	6858000	Would you like to play Lucky Egg?
6858000	6860000	No.
6860000	6867000	And then, of course, with that, they're going to be adding, they said, collaborative group gameplay features.
6868000	6871000	This is that will get you playing Pokemon Go in new, fun ways.
6871000	6879000	And they're going to be disabling gyms temporarily before the update, which they don't have a release date yet for that.
6879000	6890000	And then, on top of that, people who live around Chicago, July 22nd, they're going to be doing the first live Pokemon event there in Grand Park.
6890000	6894000	They say it's going to feature a ton of exciting festivities.
6895000	6897000	Lucky for those people in Chicago.
6897000	6901000	Tickets for that event go on sale on June 19th at 10pm Pacific.
6901000	6905000	Thank you for doing it three weeks after I plan to be there, assholes.
6905000	6908000	No, it's fine. They can't do them everywhere at once.
6908000	6914000	I'm going to be so mad if they do a legendary at the event, and then it's like, ugh.
6914000	6923000	I like to follow on Reddit, Silfrode, when I want to get theory in Pokemon Go, because they're very good at analyzing all this shit.
6923000	6930000	And they seem to think there is some type of partnership thing going on with Pokemon Go, that there's going to be more of these events throughout the U.S.
6930000	6932000	That's just kind of ran by a different organization.
6932000	6938000	And, to be fair, Ingress is doing something right now with that, with the GORUCK organization.
6938000	6940000	They have this thing called Operation Clear Field.
6940000	6947000	And that's going all over the country and doing, it's like a scavenger hunt type thing with some minor physical fitness built into it.
6948000	6954000	Not community service, but park awareness. Your parks are here, support them and all that stuff.
6954000	6958000	You mean keeping your parks clean and not driving through them in the middle of the rain?
6958000	6963000	Yes, like some Smurfs we know. But anyway, no team is perfect.
6963000	6968000	But anyway, all that aside, what was I going to say about Clear Field?
6968000	6971000	Clear Field is going to be here for two days. They're doing two days in Sacramento.
6971000	6974000	I was like, there's not enough people here that want to do that.
6975000	6980000	I played the other day, briefly. I was at the park. My kids were sitting there.
6980000	6984000	They were riding their bikes in the tennis court. And there happens to be a portal nearby.
6984000	6991000	It was a gym as well. It's like a level 12 gym. I'm like, nah, I'm not going to try to take this thing down.
6991000	6993000	So I captured the portal and linked.
6993000	6996000	So that way it made you feel better because at least you got something.
6997000	7006000	I emptied out my MUFG things so they can fill themselves up again with useless crap that I'm not going to use.
7006000	7009000	I don't play as much as I used to.
7009000	7011000	I played briefly. And it was weird though.
7011000	7016000	The day-to-day in that game has gotten stale. I really like the group events.
7016000	7019000	I'll farm with other people and give the burst to steal the needle.
7019000	7024000	I don't know who else is still playing, but the people that normally take down my stuff immediately.
7024000	7028000	I went back there because I turned off my notifications because I just don't care anymore.
7028000	7034000	And then I checked the day after and I was like, damn, it's still there. Why is it still there?
7034000	7037000	I'm surprised that normally it still gets taken down immediately.
7037000	7040000	I think the player base is just shifting a little bit.
7040000	7044000	Some people are still gung-ho on it. Some people are getting really burned out on it.
7044000	7046000	And I'm kind of in the hole like, you know...
7046000	7048000	Maybe when 2.0 comes out.
7048000	7056000	That's where I'm at. I still like the incentive to get out and walk and gamify my walk.
7056000	7058000	So I still will play for that.
7058000	7065000	But once in a while I can be talked into getting into the car to drop something that's really ugly.
7065000	7072000	But I'm really more about, let's group up with other people and do something together like a big field.
7072000	7074000	Or let's do a farm.
7074000	7078000	I like to do the social stuff still, but that's kind of where I'm at right now.
7078000	7083000	But if Pokemon Go is going to get more social like that, to tie this back to Pokemon Go.
7083000	7087000	If Pokemon Go is going to get more social like that with whatever this gym replacement thing is,
7087000	7089000	then that's a great thing for the game, I think.
7089000	7096000	Some of the most fun times I've had in Ingress is getting in a car with three other nerds
7096000	7100000	and building portals downtown, up and down all the streets downtown,
7100000	7102000	that you know the other team is going to have to spend all night taking down.
7102000	7107000	That is some of the most fun I've had, because it's more of a social thing.
7107000	7111000	So if they can give that to Pokemon, I think that'll be pretty cool.
7111000	7116000	Yes, you can do it for gyms, but it's not that exciting, I'm sorry to say.
7116000	7120000	At the end of the day, only two people can really do anything with a gym at the time.
7120000	7123000	You can do groups of two people, but it's not the same.
7123000	7125000	It's not the same.
7125000	7130000	Alright, anyway, come on, a night like this and chat says,
7130000	7135000	it's okay girl, on the bright side, you can load up on Chicago dogs and pizza pie.
7135000	7138000	Believe me, there's going to be a lot of eating in Chicago,
7138000	7142000	because I like me some deep dish pizza, and you're right, there's a lot of good food in Chicago.
7142000	7146000	Sadly, that's the type of pizza I dislike.
7146000	7147000	Oh really?
7147000	7148000	I hate deep dish pizza.
7148000	7149000	Oh man, I love it.
7149000	7151000	I hate it, that's my least favorite.
7151000	7153000	But, and some of the natives are going to get pissed.
7153000	7161000	But, to be fair, really my only experience with deep dish pizza nearby is a chain that we have, Chicago Fire.
7161000	7162000	Their pizza sucks.
7162000	7166000	But a lot of people like their pizza, but I hate their pizza.
7166000	7169000	So that's maybe, it's just the bad pizza that I'm getting.
7169000	7173000	Here's the thing with the Chicago pizza, and a lot of the natives are going to be really upset that I say this,
7173000	7175000	but you're just going to have to deal with it.
7175000	7181000	I do feel like Chicago pizza is one of those things that they have replicated pretty well in other areas.
7181000	7187000	Like, you can kind of go to chains around here, a place around here and get a pizza that's pretty decent that's like a Chicago pizza.
7187000	7189000	A New York pizza on the other hand?
7189000	7191000	I have a very hard time finding that around here.
7191000	7192000	Just saying.
7192000	7194000	There's like one place I know of that does a pretty darn good job.
7194000	7196000	But that's like it.
7196000	7198000	So, anyway.
7198000	7201000	I could get on a tangent about food.
7201000	7203000	That would just be another week here at OLR.
7203000	7205000	We do still have some gaming news to get to.
7205000	7207000	So why not another Minecraft story?
7207000	7209000	Let's talk about Minecraft season 2.
7209000	7211000	We kind of talked about this last week.
7211000	7215000	It did come up on the show, but last week was a rumor, now it's official.
7215000	7219000	The next season of Minecraft, so now it's season 2.
7219000	7220000	Story mode.
7220000	7222000	Story mode, yes, will be next month.
7222000	7224000	A lot of the first season people are returning.
7224000	7227000	Patton Oswalt, Catherine Tabor, Ashley Johnson, Scott Porter.
7227000	7230000	There's also going to be cameos from Minecraft YouTubers.
7230000	7232000	Stampycat and StacyPlays.
7232000	7235000	They've sort of already done that, but yeah, it's neat.
7235000	7237000	I have no idea who they are, but cool, cool, I guess.
7237000	7242000	The first episode is called Hero in Residence, and there's five planned episodes.
7242000	7245000	And it will be available on July 11th.
7245000	7247000	Of course, it will follow the events of the first season.
7247000	7250000	The gang are now known as Renowned Adventures.
7250000	7254000	And this game looks like it's even better than Minecraft in 4K with the graphics.
7254000	7258000	But obviously they take liberties with a lot of the Minecraft universe in this.
7258000	7260000	But that's cool.
7260000	7262000	You know, the Telltale games are fun.
7262000	7265000	I never played Minecraft season 1, but it's one of those things that's like
7265000	7268000	on a rainy day, someday, I'll have time to get around to this.
7268000	7270000	But it just hasn't happened yet.
7270000	7273000	So, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
7273000	7275000	I have stuff.
7275000	7281000	So, Indie Mega Booth has transformed.
7281000	7285000	There's now Roving Mega Shoaf...
7285000	7289000	I can't make words happen. What is up with this?
7289000	7292000	Mega Shoaf Festival, oh my god.
7292000	7298000	So, anyway, it's going to happen on July 15th in Atlanta.
7298000	7307000	And it will be Indie and local community content to basically all work together for happiness.
7307000	7313000	There will be PlayStation and Adult Swim games there to help with game creation.
7313000	7321000	And they are taking submissions for local artists, musicians, and developers who want to participate.
7321000	7328000	And the announcer of the full lineup will be on June 13th, the day the tickets go on sale.
7328000	7332000	So, people go and tell us what you think.
7332000	7338000	Because I can't teleport to Atlanta. Sorry.
7338000	7341000	If only we knew somebody who was in Atlanta.
7341000	7345000	Yeah, I wonder who.
7345000	7347000	Hopefully he'll have time in his schedule to do that.
7347000	7350000	Alright, but if not, maybe somewhere else.
7350000	7352000	Alright, just a few more stories for you guys.
7352000	7355000	Then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio. Loki.
7355000	7359000	So, one of the games that they showed a long time ago,
7359000	7363000	I want to say when they were unveiling Unreal Engine 4, was Fortnite.
7363000	7365000	It was supposed to be this new epic game.
7365000	7369000	And now that's supposed to be coming out pretty soon, actually.
7369000	7375000	They're going to be doing an early access release of it on July 25th for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
7375000	7381000	Now, for those who don't remember, Fortnite was this kind of zombie survival game.
7381000	7384000	But you actually build up your own forts and everything.
7384000	7390000	So, you build up your bases, craft weapons, and then survive waves of zombies and stuff.
7390000	7393000	And then you go out and scavenge and stuff like that. It looks kind of cool.
7393000	7396000	So, that's going to be coming out relatively soon.
7396000	7399000	And it's going to be $39.99 when it releases.
7399000	7401000	So, check it out, I guess.
7401000	7403000	I probably will check it out.
7403000	7405000	Or don't.
7405000	7408000	I don't care if you don't want to.
7408000	7411000	What am I here for? Just to tell you this stuff? I mean, seriously.
7411000	7416000	Dungeon Buster says, wow, Fortnite. That's a title I haven't heard anything from in a long while.
7416000	7422000	So, Bobby Blackwolf in chat is there and says, LOL, I probably already know all the people exhibiting there.
7422000	7425000	I hadn't heard of it though, so they haven't announced it locally.
7425000	7426000	So, hmm.
7426000	7428000	Alright, anyhow. One more story for you guys tonight.
7428000	7431000	And it's about an old favorite here at OLR.
7431000	7434000	An old favorite. Former favorite here at OLR.
7434000	7440000	Which, you know, to be fair, we wouldn't be here for these past 15 years if it weren't without Konami.
7440000	7442000	So, I have a Konami story to end things tonight.
7442000	7450000	And there was an interview at MikeTendo64 doing an interview with a European brand manager named Richard Jones over at Konami.
7450000	7454000	And there's some highlights of this interview talking about, of course, Switch support.
7454000	7455000	Jones says in this interview,
7455000	7463000	All I can say is that there's lots of internal discussions going on within Konami regarding what games we can bring to the Nintendo Switch other than Bomberman.
7463000	7467000	A game which we are well aware of its heritage and how loved it and Castlevania is.
7467000	7470000	So much that Castlevania is getting its own show on Netflix.
7470000	7475000	And because of that, we're hearing a lot of desires from our fans for a new Castlevania series.
7475000	7482000	So, we do know there is a demand for a new game, but right now, nothing is set in stone as the discussions are still ongoing.
7482000	7488000	Hey, that reminds me. Did you see the new Bloodstained trailer out of E3? Because that game looked pretty hot. Did you see that?
7488000	7489000	No, I did not.
7489000	7493000	Oh, yeah. It looks like fucking Symphony of the Night, which we were all expecting.
7493000	7497000	But with some enhanced graphics stuff, which we were kind of expecting.
7497000	7501000	So, I feel like this game may actually just be delivering what people want. So, we'll see.
7501000	7502000	I hope so.
7502000	7505000	Hopefully, we don't get Mighty No. 9, but it's looking pretty good so far.
7505000	7507000	Oh, excuse me. Back to Konami.
7507000	7509000	There was also a question about Bomberman R.
7509000	7519000	While I can't say how long for we will continue to support Super Bomberman R, I can say we do have plenty of other ideas in the works and have a few big updates on the way.
7519000	7522000	For example, I can't announce anything for version 1.5.
7522000	7525000	Disfficed to say there will be more stages and other things.
7525000	7531000	But although I can't confirm there will be more costumes and characters, there may or may not be some more later on down the line.
7531000	7532000	We'll just have to see how it goes.
7532000	7535000	That's the biggest fucking non-answer answer I've ever heard in my life.
7535000	7543000	Like, there's a version update I can't confirm or deny, but I'm gonna tell you that we're gonna see what happens.
7543000	7547000	So, look forward to this, because I think you may or may not like it.
7550000	7551000	Right?
7552000	7553000	Whatever. It's fine.
7553000	7556000	All I hear is they're gonna release another fucking Frogger game, probably.
7556000	7559000	It's just gonna be like, no one fucking cares.
7559000	7560000	Loki, it's what the fans want.
7560000	7564000	I get it. Old Frogger is cool. New Frogger, not so cool. Come on.
7566000	7568000	Alright. Well, I don't know. You know what?
7570000	7575000	Maybe Frogger on the Switch, depending on what they do with it, is something I could get behind.
7575000	7576000	Maybe.
7576000	7583000	All they would do if they did Frogger on the Switch is it would just be fucking ripping off Crossy Road at that point.
7583000	7587000	Which, technically, Crossy Road sort of rips off of Frogger, but that's basically what it would be.
7588000	7591000	Dark Tetsuya suggests, how about Frogger Fractions?
7592000	7594000	I'm down with that. That's fine.
7594000	7598000	Oh my god. Can you imagine if Konami had the balls to release Frogger Fractions?
7598000	7602000	Can you imagine just to put out that type of title or that sort of name?
7602000	7605000	Can you imagine if Konami had the fucking balls to do something like that?
7606000	7607000	They won't. They don't.
7607000	7611000	Alright. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7611000	7618000	If you want to give us a call, we're gonna take a few quick calls before, of course, gonna shut it down,
7618000	7620000	because Bethesda's starting in about 30 minutes.
7620000	7625000	Have they said yet if it's the good old folks from X-Play hosting that whole thing again?
7625000	7627000	I don't know, but I want to definitely watch it tonight, so...
7627000	7629000	Yeah. So, we'll see.
7629000	7631000	So, let's see. We are getting a call.
7631000	7633000	So, we'll get to it quickly here.
7633000	7635000	Hi. You're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7636000	7638000	Hey, this is Reginator.
7638000	7640000	Hey, Reginator. What's on your mind tonight? Quickly.
7641000	7643000	Two things real quick.
7643000	7646000	Question and a bit of information.
7646000	7653000	Question is, in your wildest dreams, if you could wish for anything,
7653000	7660000	what would you like to wish to have announced sometime during the rest of E3?
7660000	7664000	Nintendo puts out the Guardian Legend on Virtual Console for Switch.
7664000	7665000	I wish.
7665000	7668000	Do you have a wish?
7668000	7671000	I want that to be out.
7671000	7672000	Like...
7672000	7674000	No stealing my wish.
7676000	7678000	I'm not stealing. I'm adding to it.
7678000	7679000	Firsties.
7679000	7681000	I'm adding the force of my own wishes to that one.
7681000	7683000	Say HD Remake.
7683000	7684000	Ooh.
7684000	7685000	There you go.
7685000	7686000	Stealing that.
7686000	7691000	I would love to see, you know, especially after seeing the last night trailer today,
7691000	7693000	let's let these developers make a new Metroid game,
7693000	7696000	because that game looks fucking sweet.
7696000	7699000	With that art style, can you imagine a new Metroid game with that, like,
7699000	7701000	pixelated kick-ass art style?
7701000	7702000	I'm down with that.
7702000	7704000	Because I'm a nice fucking person,
7704000	7706000	I'll let Dark Soccer have the Guardian Legend thing,
7706000	7708000	and I'll fall back on F-Zero.
7709000	7711000	Wow, we all picked something from Nintendo.
7711000	7713000	Notice how I said, notice I said,
7713000	7715000	keep the bar low with Nintendo,
7715000	7718000	yet here we are just readying ourselves for disappointment.
7719000	7721000	We've been doing that for years.
7721000	7722000	I know, that's true.
7722000	7725000	I want to see not what realistically is going to happen.
7725000	7726000	I'm sorry.
7726000	7728000	I'm loving some of these answers in chat over at live.voggenetwork.com.
7728000	7730000	Bobby Black Wolf says,
7730000	7733000	Accolade cancels Bubsy and works on Metroid.
7736000	7738000	Come on a night like this in chat says,
7738000	7741000	A Zac Efron 7 Minutes in Heaven Simulator.
7744000	7747000	Would that be on the Oculus Rift or the HTV Vive?
7747000	7749000	I don't know, anyway.
7749000	7750000	What about you?
7750000	7752000	The tables have turned, Rage Nator.
7752000	7753000	What about you?
7754000	7756000	Well, if I could have anything,
7756000	7760000	I would say that Sony would sell some of the IPs
7760000	7762000	that they're not doing anything with
7762000	7764000	and have no intention of doing anything with,
7764000	7767000	sell it to a company like Valve,
7767000	7770000	let them publish new entries on Steam,
7770000	7773000	like for example, the SOCOM series.
7775000	7776000	Wait, you know what?
7776000	7779000	You said a word that completely changed my mind
7779000	7781000	about in my wildest dreams, in my wildest dreams.
7781000	7783000	Okay, here we go, here we go.
7783000	7784000	New scenario.
7784000	7787000	Because you said the word Valve,
7787000	7790000	tomorrow Sony starts their press conference
7790000	7791000	and you know, what's his name?
7791000	7792000	That's the president of Sony right now,
7792000	7794000	walks out on stage and says,
7794000	7795000	we'd like to thank you
7795000	7797000	and here we are to celebrate, you know,
7797000	7798000	all these years of Sony
7798000	7801000	and the great launch of the PlayStation 4 Pro
7801000	7804000	and then suddenly all the lights go out
7804000	7806000	and then Gabe Newell, lit by a spotlight,
7806000	7808000	walks out on the stage,
7808000	7810000	pushes the Sony CEO executive,
7810000	7812000	Asagis says, get the fuck out of here
7812000	7815000	and then says, half-life three motherfuckers
7815000	7816000	and then the ceiling opens up
7816000	7819000	and mics just fall from the ceiling
7819000	7821000	onto the crowd below
7821000	7823000	and it's out on Steam right now.
7823000	7827000	That is my wildest dream for E3.
7827000	7828000	How about that?
7828000	7830000	You officially dropped me on that.
7830000	7832000	Don't use that word.
7832000	7833000	Oh, sorry.
7833000	7834000	That's all right.
7834000	7836000	What is your second thing you wanted to ask tonight?
7836000	7839000	Well, you mentioned Outland being free
7839000	7843000	on Steam temporarily,
7843000	7845000	but the one thing that you failed to mention
7845000	7850000	was that PD2 is also free on Steam,
7850000	7854000	but there's a little asterisk and footnote on that
7854000	7858000	is for the first five million people that grab it.
7861000	7862000	You know what, RageNator,
7862000	7864000	you fucking missed your calling.
7864000	7865000	You need to be one of these,
7865000	7867000	look, I respect that you call in
7867000	7868000	and you are making sure
7868000	7869000	that we're getting these things on the cheap,
7869000	7873000	but I think you could be making money off of saving money.
7873000	7874000	Just think about this.
7874000	7877000	You could have some type of blog or website,
7877000	7879000	a cheaper-ass gamer, I don't know,
7879000	7881000	but you better think of a more original name
7881000	7884000	and you could be running some of these deals, RageNator,
7884000	7886000	and you could make a killing.
7886000	7887000	I'm just saying.
7887000	7889000	I don't see how I could do it,
7889000	7890000	but I'll take your word for it.
7890000	7895000	Don't be like us and never get better over 15 years.
7896000	7898000	All right, I'm gonna let you go, RageNators.
7898000	7899000	We can try to squeeze in another call.
7899000	7900000	Take care.
7900000	7901000	All right, you have a good one.
7901000	7902000	You too, bye.
7902000	7905000	All right, 1-877-GAME-OLR,
7905000	7908000	or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio,
7908000	7910000	if you want to give us a call.
7910000	7911000	Let's see.
7911000	7913000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,
7913000	7916000	become at Wario64, but not a bot.
7916000	7917000	Is Wario64 a bot?
7917000	7918000	I never knew that.
7918000	7922000	I see a lot of people quoting him all the time.
7923000	7925000	I did a really...
7925000	7928000	I don't know if I should talk about this on OLR.
7928000	7929000	Never mind.
7929000	7932000	All right, I blocked somebody on Twitter
7932000	7935000	that gets retweeted into my timeline a lot.
7935000	7936000	Not him.
7936000	7937000	Not that Wario64.
7937000	7938000	I blocked somebody on Twitter
7938000	7940000	that gets retweeted into my timeline a lot,
7940000	7943000	and I just don't like this person
7943000	7946000	because they threw shade at my husband on Twitter,
7946000	7947000	and I'm sorry.
7947000	7948000	I don't stand for that.
7949000	7952000	Every time I see this guy get tweeted into my timeline,
7952000	7953000	I'm like, that's the asshole
7953000	7955000	who had something to say to my husband,
7955000	7957000	and so I blocked him so I don't have to see him anymore
7957000	7959000	get retweeted into my timeline.
7959000	7960000	Is it Petty?
7960000	7962000	Yes, but if you look into my kitchen,
7962000	7964000	you'll see I'm well-stocked with Petty Crocker,
7964000	7965000	so it happens.
7965000	7967000	So there you go.
7967000	7970000	Anyway, OrangeLoungeRadio,
7970000	7973000	all one word on Skype if you want to get through.
7973000	7975000	This is your last chance.
7976000	7979000	Otherwise, we're going to wrap it up for tonight.
7979000	7981000	I guess I can just quickly kind of end on this here,
7981000	7983000	or actually, last-minute stories.
7983000	7984000	Anything you want to get on here?
7984000	7986000	There's one last thing I wanted to mention.
7986000	7987000	I forgot to mention it the other week,
7987000	7989000	but there's this guy Seth Bling on YouTube
7989000	7991000	who actually came up with this.
7991000	7994000	They call it the Super Mario World Jailbreak.
7994000	7997000	It's basically a modified save that he can create.
7997000	8000000	It creates like a hex editor within Mario World
8000000	8002000	that you can do all sorts of crazy shit,
8002000	8008000	including they had code to execute the Super NES mouse
8008000	8010000	to actually move stuff around in the game
8010000	8012000	and do all sorts of crazy stuff.
8012000	8013000	So pretty cool.
8013000	8015000	So go check him out, Seth Bling, on YouTube
8015000	8016000	to see all this stuff.
8016000	8018000	In fact, he has some arbitrary code
8018000	8020000	running on the Wii U virtual console version
8020000	8022000	of Super Mario World as well.
8022000	8026000	Quickly, what do you hope to see from Bethesda tonight, Loki?
8026000	8029000	I'd be curious to see some more,
8029000	8031000	like anything, Elder Scrolls, really,
8031000	8033000	aside from online, I'm not too interested in that.
8033000	8035000	Do you think we'll see Elder...
8035000	8037000	You know something that's been strangely absent
8037000	8040000	is Skyrim on the Switch.
8040000	8042000	Do you think now's the time to talk about that,
8042000	8044000	or do you think that's been quietly shelved?
8044000	8046000	I think it's coming, but maybe,
8046000	8048000	yeah, maybe we'll see something.
8048000	8050000	I'm not expecting too much from that, though.
8050000	8052000	I'm expecting just, I don't know,
8052000	8054000	it's like the PlayStation 3.
8054000	8055000	It's Skyrim on the Switch.
8055000	8056000	It's Skyrim on the Switch.
8056000	8059000	I mean, it's all right, but like, I don't know.
8059000	8061000	I swear to God, Bethesda, where are you?
8061000	8063000	All you have to do,
8063000	8066000	you just add a Hyrule temple somewhere,
8066000	8069000	and I swear to God, you're gonna sell
8069000	8072000	four times as many copies as you would have otherwise.
8072000	8075000	Nintendo fans, don't fuck around.
8075000	8079000	Or if I could have craftable Master Sword or something ridiculous.
8079000	8082000	I'm serious. If Bethesda is not thinking about this,
8082000	8084000	they fucking should be.
8084000	8086000	But anyway, that's just my hot take.
8086000	8087000	Take it or leave it.
8087000	8090000	I don't think, see, a lot of people are saying Elder Scrolls VI.
8090000	8093000	No, in fact, they have fucking come out and said it is not,
8093000	8095000	there is no Elder Scrolls VI this year.
8095000	8098000	I think the two, no, the two games that they're supposed to be talking about,
8098000	8101000	there's The Evil Within 2 is one,
8101000	8104000	and the other one, remember, it was hinted at,
8104000	8107000	but they didn't really see it because it was like code or something.
8107000	8110000	The new Wolfenstein game. Remember, there's Wolfenstein.
8110000	8112000	I forget what the hell the subtitle was on it,
8112000	8114000	but there was, I think, a new Wolfenstein game.
8114000	8116000	Yeah, that seems like a given.
8116000	8120000	I would say the stretch would be the Fallout New Vegas thing.
8120000	8124000	I would say a Fallout, a Fallout spinoff,
8124000	8126000	I say New Vegas with a big balloon,
8126000	8129000	Fallout spinoff in Forest Engine would be way more likely
8129000	8132000	than an Elder Scrolls thing at this point.
8132000	8136000	The Elder Scrolls focus is on Morrowind expansion for Elder Scrolls Online.
8136000	8138000	That just came out this past week.
8138000	8141000	So that's their focus on Elder Scrolls right now.
8141000	8144000	No Elder Scrolls VI tonight. Ain't happening.
8144000	8146000	If it does, I'll be pleasantly surprised.
8146000	8150000	Again, don't fucking set your bar there because you're going to be mad.
8150000	8152000	Alright.
8152000	8154000	Well, I guess that's going to do it for the show tonight
8154000	8156000	because nobody else is calling in,
8156000	8158000	but I know y'all are getting ready for that conference.
8158000	8160000	I want to thank you guys so much for listening to our show tonight,
8160000	8164000	and hey, next week is going to be a very, very special show
8164000	8167000	that wouldn't be possible without all of you guys.
8167000	8170000	So, in advance, I just want to say thanks for being here.
8170000	8172000	And as we say every week,
8172000	8174000	if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio,
8174000	8176000	tell a friend or two about the show.
8176000	8178000	Help spread the word about the show where every gamer has a voice
8178000	8180000	because if the voices aren't here for us to use,
8180000	8182000	we can't air them.
8182000	8184000	I've got voices in my head. Does that count?
8184000	8186000	No.
8186000	8188000	Stay tuned to social media throughout the week.
8188000	8190000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R, Facebook.com slash Orange Lawns Radio,
8190000	8192000	and of course, VOG Network as well.
8192000	8194000	We're hoping to have some special things throughout the week
8194000	8196000	to sort of announce and some other things we want to do
8196000	8200000	in preparation for our 15th anniversary episode, so stay tuned.
8200000	8204000	Meanwhile, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
8204000	8206000	DarkSakura, your final thought.
8208000	8210000	Loki, your final thought tonight.
8210000	8212000	I hope Sony sets it up tomorrow
8212000	8214000	because I don't want to watch trailers for games
8214000	8216000	that they showed last year
8216000	8218000	and have no sort of, you know,
8218000	8220000	answer to the backwards compatibility stuff.
8220000	8222000	And my final thought is
8222000	8224000	just set the fucking bar low
8224000	8228000	and like the game that you like.
8228000	8230000	E3, there's going to be something you like.
8230000	8232000	Focus on that.
8232000	8234000	Focus on the thing you like and run with it.
8234000	8236000	We'll see you next week to break down the rest of E3
8236000	8238000	and celebrate 15 years of Orange Lawns Radio.
8238000	8240000	Until then, be safe. Bye.
8258000	8260000	The views and opinions expressed in this program
8260000	8262000	do not necessarily reflect
8262000	8264000	those of the staff of Orange Lawns Radio
8264000	8266000	or VOG Network,
8266000	8269000	but you know they were all still true.
8271000	8273000	See you next week.
8288000	8290000	Thanks for watching!
