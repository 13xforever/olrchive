Orange Lounge Radio Here's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie and Loki 15 years ago, a San Diego teen took exception to graphic imagery in DDR Solo 2000 and 15 years later, Orange Lounge Radio Episode 691 airs. Thank you for joining us on this journey and stay tuned as it continues right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.080 --> 00:56.960
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It's Orange Lounge Radio live tonight. Episode number 691 for this June 18 of 2017. My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as she has for the past 15 years, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.480
I'm so congenial, Rob.

00:59.200 --> 00:59.800
Are you?

01:00.040 --> 01:00.600
Yes.

01:00.640 --> 01:06.120
No, you're just fan favorite. You probably are the fan favorite of the show, actually.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.880
No, you know what? It's Tech Master Loki. He's the fan favorite. Hi, Loki.

01:09.960 --> 01:10.520
Hello.

01:10.560 --> 01:11.160
How are you?

01:11.200 --> 01:13.480
Speaking of fan, it's pretty hot in here.

01:13.480 --> 01:23.760
It is. I know. We have the fan going. It's, it's, uh, it's why I had all the lights off before OLR, but it's getting hot with all these, all of us in studio and so forth. So the good news is it should cool down.

01:23.760 --> 01:25.240
At least it's not in the garage.

01:25.480 --> 01:33.600
It isn't. No, this show was in the garage at one point. It was an insulated garage, so it was supposed to be a little better. It was in the colder months. It was probably a lot better.

01:33.640 --> 01:34.000
Yeah.

01:34.000 --> 01:52.720
And in the warmer months, it was pretty, uh, it was, it was something. So anyway, we're here. We're joined with you guys over at our chat room over at vognetwork.com, The Voice of Geeks Network, where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show live.vognetwork.com.

01:52.720 --> 02:08.400
If you want to join us in our chat room where folks are being very nice and saying a lot of nice things about the show and the fact that we're turning 15 years old tonight. That's right. Our very first episode, I guess we're a little bit early. Our first episode was June 23rd of 2002.

02:08.400 --> 02:17.920
But you know what? Close enough. Close enough, dammit. Especially with the fact that, you know, I'm going out of town this upcoming weekend. So it had to be tonight or it would be really late. So close enough.

02:18.480 --> 02:42.160
15 year celebration here. And, um, you know, right off the bat, just, you know, thanks you guys for being here, whether you've been here for 15 minutes. This is your first OLR episode. Interesting, interesting night you picked to join OLR. But whether you're here for 15 minutes or 15 years, thank you for being a part of it. You know, I don't, I don't know if we would have made it this long without a lot of the encouragement that you guys have brought us over the years.

02:42.720 --> 02:54.560
Speaking of encouragement and fans and so forth, we're joined here in studio tonight by one of our longtime listeners. And it's a pleasure to have her here all the way from St. Louis. Say hello, everybody to Misty here in studio.

02:55.120 --> 02:59.680
I now have four different games registered to my emus card. It is it's Rob's fault.

03:00.320 --> 03:20.000
That's right. Traveling around playing music games, which is how this show all started, right? And that's how you found this show was because of your love of music games, right? Yep. That's right. Any because you know, I barely remember what happened last week on this show, Misty. Is there any particular memory over the 15 years of the show that you remember like a moment that was like one of your favorites?

03:20.000 --> 03:26.240
Not offhand that I haven't mentioned in the past, like episode 69.

03:26.240 --> 03:49.920
Yes, there was episode 69 was a little bit infamous. For those that weren't here, we played karaoke revolution live on because we, if you think this show is a mess now, you should see some of the early episodes. And they're out there, by the way, on the internet. If you know where to look. And if you don't know where to look, ask a guy named dark Tetsuya, who's who's wearing a trench coat around the corner, he'll sell you some old for free some old OLR episodes that are posted around up there.

03:49.920 --> 04:19.680
And I don't know if episode 69 is in the archive, but I imagine it has to be. And we were playing karaoke revolution live and Loki turned in one of the greatest renditions of all time to play the game. But you did. And that's what made it funny. That's what made it funny. So, all right. And some other folks in chat very nice Dungeon Buster saying yay, here's to another 15. Bobby Blackwell says Rob thinks DT gives away old episodes for free. That's cute. You're adorable. You have almost misty don't you have almost like every episode?

04:19.680 --> 04:29.920
I remember that one of the times you were here, you like rated all my drives. And I think you like stole every mp3 I had of Oh my gosh, she can do you wear that around your neck?

04:31.040 --> 04:43.680
Not usually. I just took advantage of the fact that I got a new computer recently to also make sure I had a good portable backup copy that also kind of creeps me out that like the 15 year history of this show fits on a fucking thumb drive.

04:43.680 --> 04:46.680
Well, they have ginormous amounts of

04:46.680 --> 05:13.600
I know I know they do. It's just it's just crazy, crazy for me. So anyway, um, I again, I you know, I'm not to get too sappy here. And I know we didn't we didn't plan like fireworks and stuff because we have E3 to get to I mean, with this all falls during E3 week, we've got to talk about what's going on a gaming because that's what we're here to do. And we didn't plan a lot of fireworks for tonight. Because you know, it's, I don't after celebrating five years, then 10 years, then 600.

05:13.600 --> 05:43.160
Then 500. It's kind of like you kind of go, well, what's there left to do, but do what people tune in every week to hear. So I know we don't have a lot of fanfare tonight. But you know, just again, I just I just want to say a big thank you from for me, not just to my co host. I mean, I think I said this in a Facebook post earlier on social media, but not everybody could do one thing over and over and over again every week for 15 years. That takes an extraordinary amount of discipline. And that's not something I

05:43.160 --> 06:13.080
certainly by any means could take sole credit for. I mean, Dark Soccer and Loki have been committed to this from the very beginning Loki when he wasn't even invited in the very beginning. But obviously, we've retconned him back to a full host since Episode One. But yeah, I mean, thank you guys for for being here every week, because truly, this show would not have lasted without that sort of discipline that it takes from everybody, not just one of us. So but also, you know, again, thanks to listeners for making this possible. I don't want to give

06:13.080 --> 06:43.040
too many specific thank yous because I'm always afraid that I'm going to leave somebody out. So I'm just going to give a very, very, very broad thanks. But I do want to just call out just a couple few things that I think have to be called out for like this would not have happened if if not for these folks. And then if Dark Soccer or Loki want to add anything, by all means, but I would say we have to of course, say thank you to Travis Donovan from Understation Live, mostly because I would get an Instagram if I didn't call him out. No, just kidding. But the fact that Travis

06:43.040 --> 07:03.080
really opened my eyes and Jamie's eyes from being the longtime guest host she was on that show, to the fact that this was even possible. Like I didn't even know that this was an outlet until Travis kind of opened that door for me. So for that, I'm incredibly thankful, even though I know he's very bitter, the show is still going. I say that would love and I'm hoping he does come back.

07:03.080 --> 07:09.560
I function on the tears of the bitter tears of those who would stand against me. So I don't think Travis stands against them.

07:09.560 --> 07:13.880
No, Travis doesn't. But there have been some some mouthy dudes out there.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.000
Yeah, there have.

07:15.000 --> 07:15.560
Guess what?

07:15.560 --> 07:17.960
Has anything ever been mansplained to you, Dark Soccer?

07:17.960 --> 07:25.480
Oh, all the fucking time. But you know what? I have to say to all of them in a glorious, operatic voice. Fuck you.

07:26.440 --> 07:48.840
So one of my good friends, I consider him a good friend. He was on a TV show here called Big Brother like seven years ago. And I, he was not portrayed very well on the show. He was a bit of a villain on the show. And I stole this saying from him and I love it. And Dark Soccer, I know, I know this applies to you too. Haters are my motivators.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.600
I can dig with that.

07:50.680 --> 08:02.520
I think that's something I've took from his that's Ronnie from season 11. If anybody watches that show, he gave me that phrase once and I've held on to that for a long time, especially especially in the past few years.

08:02.520 --> 08:08.920
But trust me, I drink cup pools of salty tears on a daily basis. And baby, they ain't mine.

08:10.760 --> 08:15.800
I also have to say thank you. This is so important. You guys know him as the voiceover guy here on the show.

08:15.800 --> 08:26.280
But Jason, VX JasonXV, like literally this show would not have a place to be if it wasn't for Jason. Jason has been the master of the technical side of things.

08:26.280 --> 08:44.920
And ensuring that I technically, I don't think he was here in the very, very, very beginning, but he came on like pretty quick and to help us out and to have a website to even have this and our vast weighty MP3 library that bared the weight of when iTunes launched podcasting for the very first time.

08:44.920 --> 08:57.080
And we were one of the video game shows on it back when there were only like 20 video game shows on iTunes, if you can even remember such a day at this point. Jason has made sure that this site ran through all of it, all of it.

08:57.080 --> 09:07.800
And anytime I've ever had a concern, even if I haven't taken a minute to ask Jason, like, you know, like, how are things, you know, in the past few months, but I'm like, Jason, the website's broken.

09:08.760 --> 09:24.840
Like, he's on it, and he fixes it. So like, I really can't stress that enough that you guys don't hear him all the time, although there was a period of time, he was coming to this show a lot because his workout I'm out here, but I really can't stress enough that like this show, you wouldn't even fucking hear it if it wasn't for Jason. So that is so important.

09:24.840 --> 09:52.440
And from a technical perspective, also deep man, I have to also certainly give him a nod because that even though the website, our main websites a little bit old, it is all because, you know, deep man had a huge hand of the design of that. And we still use that to this day. So for that, we're thankful. And then probably the only other like big, big thank you I have to give here at the top is, of course, to Bobby Blackwolf, who is, you know, the voice you hear at vogue network has been a business partner in vogue network has

09:53.320 --> 10:19.760
saved this show from going off the air when we had to leave live 365 because the fees were getting too out of control, and really brokered the deal between us and all games radio, which was a very important period in the history of this show. And I know, you know, I know, we ended up making a decision to leave that network to do what we're doing at vogue network, but I have nothing but great things to say about all games and our years there and their hopeful continued success over there.

10:20.320 --> 10:46.960
And you know, we are on E3 week. And seriously, and I say this all the time, the best E3 ever was that year when like all the all games broadcasters were there. And there was that frickin arena. And you remember that in Santa Monica, we were walking and it was just like it was off the hook. And that was stuff that our relationship with all games provided us over those years. So that's very important. So a big thank you. Again, I don't want to leave anybody out. So I'm sure I'm leaving millions of people out with this.

10:46.960 --> 10:51.480
I'd like to those are just some of the most important ones. My drag mother, the Virgin de Guadalupe.

10:56.080 --> 10:59.480
Loki, Dark Soccer, anything that I forgot that are worth saying?

10:59.960 --> 11:05.200
I'd like to thank the members of the the gay frat house that I slept in during episode three.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.840
That was the she's not even kidding. She's not even kidding whatsoever.

11:07.840 --> 11:13.160
I slept in the Harry Potter room of the gay frat house, San Diego. And that was like what episode three?

11:13.800 --> 11:18.360
It was it was it was early on. It was early on. Speaking of all games I just noticed in chat over

11:18.360 --> 11:24.040
Derek H just joined us our old pal from all games says congrats to OLR for making it to a place few

11:24.040 --> 11:28.600
shows could even dream of. Thank you, Derek. That means an awful lot. Although I must feel in a way

11:28.600 --> 11:34.200
that I said Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice. But no all in God. It's it's fantastic to see you

11:34.200 --> 11:39.080
here, Derek. Thank you so much. Look at some other comments and chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

11:39.080 --> 11:43.320
Ragenator says I remember the OLR's first live episode on all games was the first one that I was

11:43.320 --> 11:49.800
able to listen to live. That is awesome. Come on Noel Gustin chat says Q's wind beneath my wings.

11:49.800 --> 11:55.080
No, no, we're not gonna go we're not gonna go that cheesy. But if we were to sing it, Loki would sing

11:55.080 --> 12:00.840
it just just so we're clear. I'm just kidding. But don't we want to sound half decent? True.

12:01.240 --> 12:07.320
I would probably be stuck with it. Did you ever know I fucking hate you?

12:09.560 --> 12:18.040
I think that was like episode 69 verse, you know, level of effort. Now that bar is way down there.

12:18.760 --> 12:22.680
It's like it's like Nintendo and online down there. Wait, we had a bar?

12:24.120 --> 12:26.760
There was a bar on the show? All right, there was a bar on the show.

12:26.760 --> 12:34.440
All right, anyway, let's let's move on. I will have the phone lines open in part B,

12:34.440 --> 12:38.280
we actually cut a few stories out later in the show, I want to be able to take plenty of phone

12:38.280 --> 12:43.560
calls and talk more about memories over 15 years. Well, let me actually before we before we go into

12:43.560 --> 12:47.480
E3 chat, I think this is important thing to talk about when we're talking about 15 years of OLR

12:47.480 --> 12:51.560
and realize that I'm putting my co host and Misty on the spot if she wants to join in.

12:51.560 --> 12:55.160
And you guys in our chat as well over at live.vognetwork.com. We've been doing this

12:55.160 --> 13:00.680
since 2002. That's a very long time. I know I asked a similar question to this when we celebrated

13:00.680 --> 13:05.160
10 years of OLR. But I'm curious if anybody's answers may have shifted or changed based on

13:05.160 --> 13:11.640
our perspective now versus what it would have been in 2012. In 15 years of observing video games and

13:11.640 --> 13:16.840
gaming culture, what do you think has had the biggest change on video games as we know it?

13:17.640 --> 13:21.800
What do you think has been the most important thing in our industry in 15 years?

13:21.800 --> 13:25.160
Dr. Sakura? The internet.

13:25.160 --> 13:28.440
The internet. The internet was here 15 years ago, though, right?

13:28.440 --> 13:35.080
But social media has more taken off over the course of the last 15 years. And as we've seen,

13:35.080 --> 13:44.280
you know, having a direct line to game developers to people who, you know, even upper management

13:44.280 --> 13:49.080
at some of these games and having interaction with them. It's actually I think changed a lot

13:49.080 --> 13:53.720
of the dynamic with how people, with how they get feedback from fans, especially now adding

13:53.720 --> 13:59.720
Kickstarter to everything. So I'd more put it for social media and the social aspect of it.

13:59.720 --> 14:02.840
You're piggybacking on that a little bit, if you don't mind. The social

14:02.840 --> 14:07.000
kind of aspect to me kind of extends into when we look at things like Twitch TV

14:07.560 --> 14:12.360
and what YouTube and Mixer and all that's been bringing to the table too is a very social element.

14:12.360 --> 14:16.360
It might not be social media and the same Facebook and Twitter type sense,

14:16.360 --> 14:20.280
but definitely that has been transformative as well. Absolutely.

14:20.280 --> 14:24.600
So good answer. Loki, anything you would say over 15 years?

14:24.600 --> 14:28.840
Yeah, the constant greed from publishers and developers, mostly publishers.

14:29.800 --> 14:30.600
What do you mean by that?

14:31.160 --> 14:36.120
Because they've fucked up things with online passes. They've fucked up things with

14:36.120 --> 14:41.400
microtransactions. They've fucked up things with, hey, we think we're going to drive this

14:41.400 --> 14:45.000
franchise into the ground because it needs a million releases so that we can, you know,

14:45.000 --> 14:49.160
make our investors happy. So yes, publishers.

14:49.160 --> 14:51.080
I see. So publishers ruining everything.

14:51.080 --> 14:51.640
Yes.

14:51.640 --> 14:57.800
Okay. Actually, that's not a bad answer. My answer would be probably simply Xbox Live

14:58.520 --> 15:03.880
and not solely necessarily Xbox Live, but I guess it's kind of just a more

15:03.880 --> 15:08.520
narrow version of what Jamie really said, because honestly, I kind of go along with

15:08.520 --> 15:14.840
Jamie's answer as well, but I feel like Xbox Live is really the thing that ironically

15:15.080 --> 15:19.480
killed the environment where this show started. You know, if you recall,

15:19.480 --> 15:22.200
I've told this story a million times, but I'll tell it one more time.

15:22.200 --> 15:27.320
OLR started because we all played an arcade game together that we had a lot of fun playing

15:27.320 --> 15:31.560
and that really had a community. So we all got together every week and we played DDR

15:31.560 --> 15:35.880
and then we would go out to eat. DDR followed by mozzarella sticks,

15:35.880 --> 15:38.840
because not that things made sense 15 years ago, but they did.

15:39.560 --> 15:41.960
You know, we would go play DDR, then we would go eat and we would sit around.

15:42.360 --> 15:46.680
Back then we were doing enough cardio to burn that stuff up. That was no big deal.

15:46.680 --> 15:51.640
Now it's just mozzarella sticks. But all that joking aside, I mean,

15:51.640 --> 15:57.080
I feel like Xbox Live and that whole gaming through all of that kind of murdered the arcades

15:57.080 --> 16:04.120
for a good long time. And only just now are we starting to see some of that come back through,

16:04.120 --> 16:09.320
you know, round one and some of these things that we have a little more locally where the arcade

16:09.320 --> 16:14.360
scene is kind of building again. And a lot of that is because of the ideas that they're taking

16:14.360 --> 16:19.240
from mobile gaming, which would definitely be in my top five. One of the big things that have

16:19.240 --> 16:24.920
happened in the past 15 years are the fact that everybody is a fucking gamer now because cell

16:24.920 --> 16:30.760
phones and things like Farmville and Bejeweled that even, you know, your parents play and all

16:30.760 --> 16:37.800
that stuff. So, yeah, but I think Xbox Live in particular really did a lot of damage to the

16:37.800 --> 16:43.160
arcade scene. I mean, but not that that's necessarily a bad thing. It's just an evolution,

16:43.160 --> 16:51.560
but it was certainly transformative to where we are now. Going in chat over at live.vognetwork.com

16:51.560 --> 16:56.280
Dartetsuya in chat says, I agree with Loki. That all but killed everything that wasn't Guitar Hero.

16:56.280 --> 16:59.960
I never got to play DJ Hero, but it looked like a fun game. So, it would have been cool to see

16:59.960 --> 17:05.240
a reboot of that or something. Yyr says, definitely the internet changed gaming

17:05.240 --> 17:10.280
directly, online play and indirectly, social media, community streaming, hate speech,

17:10.280 --> 17:16.520
you name it. Rage Nator says, I miss arcades, sniff. Free Kill Zero in chat pointing out,

17:16.520 --> 17:21.560
Dreamcast had online gaming, yes, but Xbox Live integrated voice chat as part of the service.

17:21.560 --> 17:26.280
Absolutely. It kind of pushed it to the next level. And I think even a lot of us look back

17:26.280 --> 17:29.560
at the Dreamcast and go, it was a system that was ahead of its time in many ways.

17:29.560 --> 17:33.800
I know, it's so crazy that Xbox Live had integrated voice chat.

17:35.720 --> 17:40.680
You know, not like a modern company nowadays that has a modern system can't integrate voice chat

17:40.680 --> 17:47.880
into theirs, but you know. Calm that hate boner down, Loki. Jesus. Let's see. Other comments over

17:47.880 --> 17:54.280
at live.vognetwork.com. Act Def says, independent development for games. That's a very good point

17:54.360 --> 18:02.280
now too, is that things like Steam, iTunes and Google Play, you know, they've allowed more indie

18:02.280 --> 18:07.080
developers to really get out there. I mean, sure. There's always been a place for indie developers

18:07.080 --> 18:12.520
and you could design something that back in the day we used to go on to a BBS and download, but

18:12.520 --> 18:19.880
it's different now. Like things like PlayStation, Xbox, even Nintendo are opened up so that more

18:19.880 --> 18:24.200
indie developers can get on the store and you can, you know, download things right next to things

18:24.200 --> 18:30.520
like Mario and, you know, Ridge Racer and all these other, you know, big, big thick titles

18:30.520 --> 18:34.920
that are on the other platforms. So it's a bit of Ridge Racer. Why won't they come back?

18:35.720 --> 18:40.280
Maybe, maybe someday, someday. Uh, and I'll do one more here and then I want to move into what's

18:40.280 --> 18:44.840
going on this week. That's the 200 mountain chat over at live.vognetwork.com says World of Warcraft

18:44.840 --> 18:49.960
is up there too. Granted, it wasn't the first MMO, but it definitely catapulted online and

18:49.960 --> 18:55.400
MMOs to mainstream. Oh, absolutely. I totally agree with that. World of Warcraft. It wasn't

18:55.400 --> 19:01.240
the first MMO, but it was a fucking massive MMO and has changed many things. Fuck, Dark

19:01.240 --> 19:06.200
Sakura still plays it pretty regularly, if I'm not mistaken. Not so much these days. I mean like

19:06.200 --> 19:11.080
EverQuest wasn't, you wouldn't consider like EverQuest 2 or something like that? Like I said,

19:11.080 --> 19:16.760
WoW wasn't the first MMO, but it was massive. And EverQuest, you know, it's kind of right up

19:16.760 --> 19:21.480
there. EverQuest did a lot as well, but you know, something about the way Blizzard does it. And,

19:21.480 --> 19:24.840
you know, we've said this before on the show, Blizzard has a great way to take a game like

19:24.840 --> 19:29.640
EverQuest and make it more accessible. But EverQuest was a lot like Final Fantasy 11,

19:29.640 --> 19:33.880
because Final Fantasy 11 was really inspired by EverQuest, where you had to kneel down to

19:33.880 --> 19:39.480
regenerate mana for quite some time. And a lot of transport took a very long time. So it's like

19:39.480 --> 19:44.680
World of Warcraft brought a lot of like quality of life, quote unquote, improvements to the genre

19:44.680 --> 19:49.240
that I think allowed it to really catapult forward. But not to say that EverQuest wasn't

19:49.240 --> 19:54.280
important because hell yeah, it was. So was Ultima Online. So was the MUDs of the, you know,

19:54.280 --> 19:58.600
older days on Telnet and all that, you know, all that stuff was the reason why World of Warcraft

19:58.600 --> 20:03.240
exists now. And now there's MMOs after it. The World of Warcraft is evolving because of,

20:03.240 --> 20:09.640
you know, things like Guild Wars, Guild Wars 2, Final Fantasy 14, Elder Scrolls and all these

20:09.640 --> 20:13.560
games, you know, even WoW takes some of its cues from at this point. So, you know, that whole

20:13.560 --> 20:19.960
genre has really been pushed forward. So, Act Deft brings up Pokemon Go. I mean, even though that's

20:19.960 --> 20:29.160
really recent, certainly that almost feels like kind of a litmus test for the future in some ways,

20:29.160 --> 20:32.120
especially with the fact that, you know, like I said, more and more people are gaming with

20:32.120 --> 20:35.160
phones in their pocket. You know, what Pokemon Go did was a very,

20:36.120 --> 20:41.080
it's a thing that we don't see very often in gaming. So anyhow, lots of good answers,

20:41.080 --> 20:48.360
you guys. But let's talk about what's going on this week in games. Lots of news. E3. So last

20:48.360 --> 20:53.560
week on the show, we talked about Microsoft. We talked about EA a little bit as well. And so

20:53.560 --> 20:58.360
after the show happened, Bethesda's conference happened where they showed pretty much a lot of

20:58.360 --> 21:01.800
things we expected to see. And then they showed that Wolfenstein 2 kind of cut.

21:01.800 --> 21:05.000
Yeah. I mean, I expected that.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.120
Yeah. And Evil Within 2, which I think a lot of people were expecting as well, which,

21:08.120 --> 21:12.040
you know, and it was a lot of people were like, it's short. It was short.

21:12.040 --> 21:14.760
It was, it was only 30 minutes, but they showed off like,

21:14.760 --> 21:16.680
It was longer than that, but it was, it was still short.

21:16.680 --> 21:17.000
Really?

21:17.000 --> 21:19.720
Like 45 or an hour, but still, it's still.

21:19.720 --> 21:23.720
But yeah, then they showed off. What else? So they kind of started off with, I want to say,

21:23.720 --> 21:27.480
was it the VR stuff I think that they started off with? I don't remember, but

21:28.040 --> 21:35.400
they did show off like Doom VFR. They had Fallout 4 VR, which they kind of showed. I mean, it's just.

21:35.400 --> 21:38.360
Did they do Skyrim VR there or did, was that, they saved that for Sony?

21:40.200 --> 21:45.160
That was Sony. So they did those two and then they were showing off,

21:46.440 --> 21:49.640
I guess this is all going to be completed out of order. So they had the DLC for

21:50.200 --> 21:57.080
Dishonored 2 that they showed off. They had, of course, you know,

21:57.080 --> 22:01.880
the trailers for the other games. I know they ended with Wolfenstein. They showed off.

22:02.840 --> 22:07.480
Let me ask, not to backtrack too much, but I have to ask this because I'm curious about this and

22:07.480 --> 22:10.520
the chatters as well. Do you want to play Fallout in VR?

22:10.520 --> 22:13.080
Yeah, I think it'd be fun. I don't know.

22:13.080 --> 22:13.960
What about Skyrim?

22:14.520 --> 22:18.840
Skyrim looks fun in VR. I see. I didn't see the trailer like originally. I mean,

22:18.840 --> 22:23.720
it looks all right. I'd just be curious to see how it, how it actually moves around and plays

22:23.720 --> 22:28.760
because like the trailer looks like, and this is the thing, like the trailers look like you kind

22:28.760 --> 22:34.200
of have free control of your character, which is fine. But then like the Doom one had like

22:34.200 --> 22:37.960
teleporting around. I really don't like VR that teleports around. I know

22:37.960 --> 22:42.840
the reason that they do that is because people get motion sick, but honestly,

22:42.840 --> 22:46.200
I know I'm not one of those people that gets motion sick from that.

22:47.160 --> 22:51.320
See, and there's folks in chat, like Dr. Seuss says, I play Doom VR and I kind of look at that

22:51.320 --> 22:55.880
and go, um, I would need a barf bag too because Doom is a fat, I mean, maybe they make some

22:55.880 --> 22:59.560
adjustments, but Doom is a fast moving game. It's teleporting though. So you're, you're,

22:59.560 --> 23:03.640
you can dash, I guess, in different directions, but it's all basically blinking from one spot

23:03.640 --> 23:07.720
to another. And that's what a lot of these VR games do. And it's all right, but it's,

23:08.440 --> 23:13.880
Doom was such a fast paced game that like, it doesn't seem like you'd be able to do that.

23:13.880 --> 23:18.440
Yeah. Yeah. I would like the option to be able to just run around and stuff. And then, you know,

23:18.440 --> 23:23.080
if I don't want to do that, I can teleport. Maybe it's because of the control scheme because you're

23:23.080 --> 23:28.360
using the Vive controllers. And so, you know, maybe there's not really analog sticks that can

23:28.360 --> 23:31.800
move you around like that. Um, I know with Skyrim, they are saying one of the options,

23:31.800 --> 23:35.320
you can play with the controller. So that'd be fine too. If I'm playing with just the controller

23:35.320 --> 23:41.960
and I can look around, man, I think that'd be pretty cool. Um, so after Bethesda, uh,

23:41.960 --> 23:46.200
Monday morning, hold on. Yeah, hold on. Sure. There's still more stuff to talk about,

23:46.200 --> 23:49.720
but that's okay. Um, because of course we talked, they showed off, um,

23:51.640 --> 23:58.680
I know they didn't show off. They show Skyrim for the switch during Bethesda. Was that three?

23:58.680 --> 24:03.240
Yes, because that's when they announced, Oh, which ties into last week's show by the way,

24:03.240 --> 24:06.440
cause I remember, no, cause I tweeted you right away. Cause we had just talked about

24:06.440 --> 24:11.480
an hour before that's when they showed in Skyrim, they had the Zelda stuff was in amiibo support.

24:11.560 --> 24:17.560
It was the amiibo would unlock, um, link costume and the master sword, which you

24:17.560 --> 24:23.240
fucking said on OLR. I had said the temple of time or something. They put a new dungeon in there.

24:23.240 --> 24:28.920
So I'd like to think I was close, but yeah, that was a, that was a good call. And, and,

24:30.040 --> 24:35.000
and to, to piggyback on what we were saying last week, I said, people are not going to buy Skyrim

24:35.000 --> 24:38.920
yet again, if there's not something for them. And I said, if they want to appeal to the Nintendo

24:38.920 --> 24:44.200
fan base, put fucking Zelda stuff in there and that Nintendo fans will eat that up. And guess

24:44.200 --> 24:49.240
what was happening on Twitter. Then my Nintendo fan boys on Twitter were eating it up and were

24:49.240 --> 24:52.680
like, yeah, I'm going to get Skyrim. And I was like, see that that's how they're going to sell

24:52.680 --> 24:58.120
it on the switch. Anyways. Um, but the, the thing though that I noticed that they were talking about

24:58.120 --> 25:04.280
is they're brand new. Um, I forget what they're calling it now, but it's like, um, a companion

25:04.280 --> 25:11.080
service that they have for Skyrim and for fallout for where they're basically going to selling mods.

25:11.080 --> 25:16.280
Yeah, no, because they've tried this bullshit before on steam and there's a huge fucking

25:16.280 --> 25:23.320
backlash for it. And so now they're doubling down and trying it again on, I always assume on console

25:23.320 --> 25:29.800
and on, um, the steam version as well. So basically this would allow creators to, to create

25:29.800 --> 25:35.480
mods that they're going to supposedly it's going to go through some sort of QA, but that's a QA

25:35.480 --> 25:40.200
that's that's peachy. Um, so they're going to go through some QA process and it's supposed

25:40.200 --> 25:45.880
to work with the DLC and stuff, but at the same time, it's basically like, you know, they're

25:45.880 --> 25:52.840
saying that, you know, Bethesda can sell stuff through this marketplace and it was allowed the

25:52.840 --> 25:57.400
trophies and everything that still work, but it's not going to get rid of the other mods that are

25:57.400 --> 26:05.640
free. But I just, I just don't like it. I don't like it at all. It just, it's sours new. Modding

26:05.640 --> 26:09.640
has been going on for a long time. People don't sell mods. People just make mods because they

26:09.640 --> 26:14.600
want to make mods. And now I just think this is not a good thing because they're going, they're

26:14.600 --> 26:18.840
going to fuck it up here. Here's my take on it. And some folks are going to strongly disagree with

26:18.840 --> 26:26.040
me and that's okay. But I have moved the fuck on from Skyrim. Like I'm, that's cool that they can

26:26.040 --> 26:32.200
mod it and all this stuff, but I, I'm done with Skyrim. We're done. Right. You're done. Skyrim

26:32.200 --> 26:37.160
quality four is relatively new, but if this shit's going to work right now that you better believe

26:37.160 --> 26:41.320
that whenever the next other schools game comes out, they're going to do that shit again. That's

26:41.320 --> 26:45.000
fair. All right, let's move on for time's sake though. The only reason I was trying to get us

26:45.000 --> 26:50.120
past this for time, that's okay. So quickly, the PC gaming thing, I don't think there was a lot of

26:50.120 --> 26:54.200
bigs, the age empires. They were trying to push like, there's like some VR game that they're

26:54.200 --> 26:59.000
trying to push as an e-sport that looks just like enters game. I mean, it is all right. I mean,

26:59.560 --> 27:06.040
I don't know VR and e-sports, I don't, that's a hard mix, but Nino Cooney on PC that caught my

27:06.040 --> 27:10.920
ear too. Cause I was not expecting that to go to PC. That always struck me as a very like

27:10.920 --> 27:15.800
console based thing. So that was surprising to me. Uh, and then there was the Ubisoft,

27:15.800 --> 27:20.600
which pretty much had some pretty good stuff. Yeah. And everybody's mainly talking about the

27:20.600 --> 27:25.000
beyond good and evil two, which, you know, that big reveal there that yes, it's still coming.

27:25.000 --> 27:30.760
Yes. So the rabbit's cross Mario game looks all right. Um, that's an upgrade for you.

27:32.680 --> 27:36.680
It sold you a little bit on, no, it didn't sell me. It looks okay. Like it's not the type of

27:36.680 --> 27:41.240
game play. Doesn't that sound like an upgrade for where he was at last week though? I think it does.

27:41.240 --> 27:47.240
I never said it would sound terrible. Some of their other like VR games that they have coming

27:47.240 --> 27:53.880
out look okay. They're um, I'm trying to remember what it's called now, but like their new toys to

27:53.880 --> 27:59.160
life game looks like shit. It's like some space combat thing. Like that is really weird. It's

27:59.160 --> 28:04.040
like it attaches to the controller. You have this stupid toy spaceship on your controller.

28:04.040 --> 28:10.520
It just seems really awkward and strange, but they've got that. Um, you know, obviously the,

28:10.520 --> 28:16.520
um, new far cry game looks awesome. Um, I'm trying to think. Um, I didn't really care about

28:16.520 --> 28:22.920
the pirates game. I don't care about assassin's creed, um, with my UAV Eagle or whatever it was.

28:23.640 --> 28:29.240
Um, what else? I don't remember everything else that they had. I know that they had a new,

28:29.240 --> 28:34.600
the crew game, which I don't know. That's all right. I guess. But I think out of everything,

28:34.600 --> 28:40.280
like there, they had a pretty impressive lineup of games, I guess. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. It

28:40.280 --> 28:44.680
seems like a lot of people were very pleased with Ubisoft. And again, I, I have not been calling on

28:44.680 --> 28:48.840
dark soccer or Misty because I don't think they watch these things, but please, please, by all

28:48.840 --> 28:54.360
means, jump in. If you have something to say on, on this stuff. Okay. I still want to dominate the

28:54.360 --> 29:00.440
conversation with, with you two here. So, um, but, uh, let's see also, uh, let's see after Ubisoft,

29:00.440 --> 29:03.480
let's talk about Sony. So let's spend a little time on Sony because obviously it's one of the

29:03.480 --> 29:09.160
bigger ones. I tried to watch live, but I was at the park of my kids. And so I ate through my data

29:09.240 --> 29:16.360
plan pretty fast. So I, I missed a few things, but I did see some of it. So it was pretty much like I

29:16.360 --> 29:21.400
anticipated that it was going to be just, we're showing new trailers for games we've already

29:21.400 --> 29:26.680
announced. And to be honest, the whole like shadow classes thing that had already been leaked out,

29:26.680 --> 29:30.360
that it was coming as an announcement. So I wasn't all that surprised by it. I mean,

29:30.360 --> 29:34.840
it looks cool, but it's like the second time they've remade that game already. Yeah. I was,

29:35.160 --> 29:40.600
I was like, Oh, okay, cool. Um, I wasn't expecting that. I didn't pick up on the leak thing,

29:40.600 --> 29:45.720
but I was kinda like, Oh, all right, cool. Yeah. So, I mean, it is a good, it is a good game,

29:45.720 --> 29:49.720
but yeah, it just, it did, they did remaster it just the last time. Yeah. But then they have like,

29:49.720 --> 29:53.160
I guess new trailers and my whole thing was like, I wanted to see what they were going to do with,

29:53.160 --> 29:57.800
you know, PlayStation VR. And I kind of missed some of that in the Skyrim thing. Sounds kind

29:57.800 --> 30:02.200
of cool. I'd be definitely willing to check it out. Um, what are the, there was a game called

30:02.200 --> 30:11.240
Moss that kind of caught me. I don't know. It's it's okay. I, I heard super hots coming to, um,

30:11.240 --> 30:15.480
the PlayStation VR. I think that was that I'm interested in because that looks awesome on PC,

30:16.120 --> 30:20.680
the VR version. So I'd want to check that out. Um, you know, they showed off, you know,

30:20.680 --> 30:27.320
the new trip, like it's a new trailers for, um, that zombie game that they have days gone days

30:27.320 --> 30:30.920
gone. Yeah. It looked okay. I mean, I don't know. It's just kind of a generic,

30:32.360 --> 30:35.800
there's a lot of games that they have coming that I just don't care about.

30:35.800 --> 30:41.800
You know, honestly, like here's the thing. I had a very tepid reaction to Sony's conference. I like,

30:41.800 --> 30:45.320
I was like, okay. But there was also, there was still a part of me that was kind of like, that's

30:45.320 --> 30:52.440
it. Like I here's, and here's the thing for me is that Sony started, like, I don't know if you saw

30:52.440 --> 30:58.600
anything in that hour before the press conference, but I feel like some of the best shit was before

30:58.600 --> 31:03.800
the press conference even started. So when they announced undertale is coming to PlayStation four

31:03.800 --> 31:08.440
and Vita, I was like, okay, if they're announcing this before the conference even begins, what kind

31:08.440 --> 31:12.920
of fucking Whopper are they about to drop on us? And then when that Whopper didn't come, I was like,

31:12.920 --> 31:18.520
Oh, okay. Like they said that they're holding off on announcements for games com. Like they've got

31:18.520 --> 31:22.840
stuff that they are going to announce a games weird to me, it is kind of weird. But at the

31:22.840 --> 31:27.320
same time, like I was disappointed that nothing was addressed about backwards compatibility.

31:27.320 --> 31:32.040
It's just like, whatever. There was no, they don't care. It would have been nice to see some

31:32.040 --> 31:36.200
sort of price drops for like at least the PlayStation pro or something would have been

31:36.200 --> 31:39.960
cool. I guess they had stuff on sale in the gold PlayStation four and stuff like that.

31:41.160 --> 31:45.240
But yeah, there wasn't really a whole ton of new announcements. I mean, there's a lot of stuff that

31:45.240 --> 31:49.560
they just didn't show. And I'm assuming that's all going to be a games com in a little bit, but

31:50.520 --> 31:54.680
yeah, it's just kind of, and then on top of that, there wasn't really any big titles,

31:54.680 --> 31:59.720
which one of these big titles is coming out this holiday? Cause I couldn't figure out which one it

31:59.720 --> 32:07.560
was. It was, it is the uncharted spinoff is the holiday one. Ooh. Yeah. I mean, and that's,

32:07.560 --> 32:11.560
that's kind of why I think I ended up having a very tepid reaction to Sony. Like I didn't,

32:11.560 --> 32:15.000
I didn't hate it, but I knew some other people, some other friends of mine were kind of getting

32:15.000 --> 32:18.520
into it a little bit. Cause they were like, Oh, it was awesome. And all this stuff. And I was like,

32:18.520 --> 32:22.840
I guess maybe it's just because I'm not as into God of war as other people I know. And I really

32:22.840 --> 32:27.720
don't care about this days gone stuff, but I did feel like it was like a lot of updates. And to be

32:27.720 --> 32:34.680
fair, to be fair to Sony, they've had some really killer E3 years and not every year can be the

32:34.680 --> 32:42.120
final fantasy seven remake flack Shenmue three flack. Like they can't all be that year where

32:42.120 --> 32:46.440
they, you know, whip it out and put it on the table. Like you're, you know, here, that would

32:46.440 --> 32:51.800
be unreasonable. Here's, here's, here's some of my expectations being horribly, uh, or I'm being

32:51.800 --> 33:00.280
horribly disappointed by it. Final fantasy 15 VR support, uh, fucking fish. Are you fucking kidding

33:00.280 --> 33:04.680
me? Like one of the reasons I bought 15 is because, Oh, the VR is going to be fucking sweet.

33:04.680 --> 33:09.080
And you know, the game looks pretty sweet. I haven't gone back to play the game, but

33:09.080 --> 33:13.880
are you serious? Why even waste your time with a fucking fishing game? It's just so

33:13.880 --> 33:18.200
goddamn stupid. Nobody is getting excited about it. I mean, it was, it's the fucking

33:18.200 --> 33:23.480
nineties and Sega bass fishing's coming out. Nobody fucking cares about a fishing game in

33:23.480 --> 33:27.720
final fantasy. Uh, dark Tetsuya and chat says they've come a long way since that disaster in

33:27.720 --> 33:33.880
2006. Nobody's going to fuck up that bad ever again. That's that's a given nobody in the

33:33.880 --> 33:37.960
industry and Nintendo didn't have a great year. It was that year or the year after Nintendo.

33:37.960 --> 33:41.560
There was Microsoft that one year. So, I mean, yeah, that's true. That's true. So, but

33:42.360 --> 33:47.160
you know, I we've come a long way from there and I didn't, I didn't hate Sony by any means,

33:47.160 --> 33:51.800
but it was one of those when it was done, I was left with polite clapping. That was,

33:51.800 --> 33:55.960
that was, it was a polite clap. I was like, I was like, Oh man, you know, I, I missed the last

33:55.960 --> 33:59.880
end, the end of the conference. And then I went back and read them like, Oh, okay. You know,

33:59.880 --> 34:03.400
what else needs to be addressed? Because I bet many people forget this because this is the sort

34:03.400 --> 34:08.920
of things that people forget, but the audio on Twitch, and apparently it was also the audio

34:08.920 --> 34:14.680
stream that was going to all the movie theaters was like borked the first 15 minutes. And when

34:14.680 --> 34:19.000
you have the spotlight on you, you can't afford those kinds of fuckups. I'm sorry. That was,

34:19.000 --> 34:23.720
that was, that was pretty embarrassing. So I just, I have to call that out that that was,

34:23.720 --> 34:27.080
it was a little bit of a disappointment that something that you would think would be that

34:27.080 --> 34:30.440
simple. It must be something about that venue because they moved to that venue last year.

34:30.440 --> 34:34.600
And I remember last year had an audio problem too. So Sony might need to think about changing

34:34.600 --> 34:37.720
the venue. If that's, what's causing their audio problems. I don't know. But I just,

34:37.720 --> 34:42.920
it kind of, I think Loki, that's why you might've missed the uncharted is the holiday game because

34:42.920 --> 34:46.280
that was when the audio was fucking up. So I watched on YouTube. I didn't have,

34:46.280 --> 34:51.480
Oh, that's why. But then YouTube was like lagged. YouTube was like almost a minute behind. It was

34:51.480 --> 34:57.800
weird. But anyway, I, I had to call that out. Just kind of a stern, stern finger waving.

34:58.280 --> 35:02.520
Um, but I mean, not to say like, again, it's not like I'm like, Oh, I'm going to sell my

35:02.520 --> 35:07.560
PS4. It was so bad. No, it wasn't. Um, and you know, the Spider-Man game looks sweet,

35:07.560 --> 35:13.560
I guess. I mean, but I just, I feel like, okay, that was the big reveal last year and Days Gone

35:13.560 --> 35:19.080
was shown twice last year. And God of War was last year. And all this shit was last year.

35:19.080 --> 35:22.680
Detroit looked all right. Detroit did look all right. That game, I'm, I'm,

35:22.680 --> 35:25.720
probably more than anything else they showed. I'm looking forward to it. It's in the lead

35:25.720 --> 35:29.960
there. Was that the, that's, is that the guy from like fucking, um, Grey's Anatomy?

35:29.960 --> 35:31.880
Cause it sure as hell looks like the guy from Grey's Anatomy.

35:31.880 --> 35:36.280
I don't know actors and what they're on very well. It is a real person. It is a real person.

35:36.280 --> 35:38.760
But yeah, it looks like the, I forget his name, but.

35:38.760 --> 35:45.160
Um, but I will say this. Sony was also strangely short. It was very short. It was an hour,

35:45.160 --> 35:50.680
not 90 minutes. Not, they went two hours, one year. It was an hour. Uh, now you could say that

35:50.680 --> 35:56.200
the pre-show hour, I mean, again, cause they, there was that Jack box looking thing where they

35:56.200 --> 36:00.520
had, everybody was on their phone controlling the game. And there was a game from the Until Dawn

36:00.520 --> 36:06.200
people that was like, you had somebody that was like a rebel spy, basically in your midst that

36:06.200 --> 36:08.200
was trying to screw the game over. And that looked like a lot of fun.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.280
Yeah. It is the guy from Grey's Anatomy. That's why I thought I knew him.

36:10.280 --> 36:14.200
Okay. But I was like, it was just weird to me because I felt like the things I got most

36:14.200 --> 36:17.960
excited about with Sony were all like the pre-show content, which I don't know what

36:17.960 --> 36:22.360
that says about me as a gamer. But anyway, with the short stuff, here's something else I noticed

36:22.360 --> 36:29.240
was really missing, really, really missing. The sizzle reel of third party and independent stuff.

36:29.240 --> 36:35.480
I mean, sure you had Destiny 2. I know that, you know, the Call of Duty or whatever. I know third

36:35.480 --> 36:40.440
parties weren't absent, but where, where was that sizzle reel of indie games? Indie games were gone.

36:41.240 --> 36:47.400
And this, and I remember the year when they had all these indie developers up on stage,

36:47.400 --> 36:51.720
bam, bam, bam, bam. Like there was like, all these games are coming to PS4. And that was like

36:51.720 --> 36:57.960
a big year. And it was, it felt absent. It felt really absent this year to not be showcasing some

36:57.960 --> 37:04.040
of the indie and the lower support on the main stage. That was a little regretful, I think for,

37:04.040 --> 37:10.760
for Sony. But, um, otherwise it was okay. That's, that's really like, it wasn't good. It wasn't bad.

37:10.760 --> 37:17.160
It was, it was polite clap. I had a nice polite clap at the end. Um, how about, uh, I don't know

37:17.160 --> 37:22.040
if there's anything you guys want to add with Sony or anything you guys saw or read about after

37:22.040 --> 37:28.600
the fact. No, I don't know if it's particularly Sony, but I'm still pretty excited about Marvel

37:28.600 --> 37:35.640
versus Capcom, infinite. You're like the only one I know. I'm sorry. If you play the demo, you might

37:35.640 --> 37:42.280
not, you might. And more than that, I'm actually super interested in, uh, the Dragon Ball FighterZ.

37:42.280 --> 37:46.360
Okay. Yeah. Cause it's Arc Systems. Microsoft showed that, didn't they? That was on their thing.

37:47.320 --> 37:51.320
But it is, but that is going to be on both. Um, but I will say with the Marvel versus Capcom,

37:51.320 --> 37:55.000
the biggest complaints I'm hearing about it are the art style. Like Chun Li looks like she's

37:55.000 --> 37:59.720
regressed a little bit. That's what I'm hearing. I was perfectly fine with the art style because,

37:59.720 --> 38:02.760
I mean, basically I was just really paying attention to try to hear you the whole time.

38:03.480 --> 38:09.240
Although I'm not excited about his voice just because I've gotten more familiar with his

38:09.240 --> 38:16.120
Japanese voice. So I'm hoping that I can play it in Japanese and have the voices. I'm more

38:16.120 --> 38:19.560
familiar with Troy Baker doing all the voices this year. He should do all of them.

38:20.440 --> 38:24.440
But I am, I'm, I'm pretty excited. I mean, it might just be the Dragon Ball kick I've been

38:24.440 --> 38:30.360
on lately too, but I mean, a Dragon Ball game done by the fucking guilty gear people sign me up.

38:31.640 --> 38:37.000
How about a fighting game? That's Troy Baker versus who's the other guy that doesn't know

38:37.000 --> 38:43.800
this is Nolan North versus, um, Tara strong. I was like, who's the lady that does he have

38:43.800 --> 38:49.160
Tara strong. So it will do that. Like it'll be a, it'll be a trio game. I don't know. Anyway,

38:49.160 --> 38:54.760
uh, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Uh, let's see free kill zero and chat asks,

38:54.760 --> 39:01.480
Oh yeah. With Destiny 2, what platform are you all including chat considering PC 100%?

39:01.480 --> 39:07.000
I don't even care that there's a gap PC, PC, PC. I don't really, I'm not that interested in

39:07.000 --> 39:11.640
Destiny 2 just because I never played the first one. Although I have it. I just haven't played it.

39:12.200 --> 39:14.520
If I was going to pick a platform, it'd probably be PC.

39:15.080 --> 39:23.240
No, I, I, I, on my new 4k rig, I'm going to have by the holiday trust. That's like coming out of

39:23.240 --> 39:28.280
E3. That was like my number one takeaway is that I fucking want a 4k monitor and a 4k a graphics

39:28.280 --> 39:33.560
card. That'll do it. Yes. I'm well aware. You can't get one for $500, which is why, but I,

39:33.560 --> 39:39.400
I will invest a little more in my PC because I do so much gaming on my PC.

39:39.960 --> 39:45.640
So, um, yeah, for sure. Destiny 2 on PC. Um, so, okay. So I think that's all there is to

39:45.640 --> 39:50.680
say about Sony for now. So how about Loki? How about Nintendo? How about Nintendo?

39:50.680 --> 39:54.680
I mean, Nintendo is okay. I'm trying to, I'm trying to think of the exact stuff that they

39:54.680 --> 39:59.400
showed. So like I remember, um, well they ended with Odyssey. So it was,

40:00.200 --> 40:04.360
but Mario Odyssey looks fucking sweet. Mario Odyssey looks really good. And I watched, um,

40:04.360 --> 40:08.920
like the hat on everything that was rad. I mean, that's all right. Yeah. I watched like, um,

40:09.000 --> 40:13.400
actual like gameplay they were doing like up through treehouse live. So I watched a lot of

40:13.400 --> 40:17.880
that. Cool. I mean, it looks pretty good. It looks like a good Mario game, which is

40:17.880 --> 40:23.880
good. It's what the system needs. I'm not super excited. I mean, I was never really in the 3d

40:24.440 --> 40:28.840
Metroid games, Metroid prime for just announcing that they're working on that.

40:30.280 --> 40:37.000
I mean, cool. When the fuck is it coming out? No idea. I mean, so that's cool. At least that

40:37.000 --> 40:41.320
they're working on it. I feel, I feel a little differently here because I'm just,

40:41.320 --> 40:46.920
I was so fucking happy that Nintendo acknowledged Metroid, you know, especially after forgetting

40:46.920 --> 40:51.240
its birthday, that Nintendo was like, yes, we're doing Metroid prime for even though

40:51.240 --> 40:56.360
retro is not doing it, which is interesting. I like the, I'm not as big on the 3d Metroids

40:56.360 --> 41:01.160
myself, but I did like prime three and I liked the original prime when it was out.

41:01.960 --> 41:06.040
I'm going to fucking play it. I'm sure that the new, the new prime game is going to be,

41:06.760 --> 41:10.600
look really nice. Cause I mean, it's what was prime three on? Was that the, that wasn't the

41:10.600 --> 41:14.440
Wii was it? It was on Wii. Yeah. Cause they did the trilogy. They did the trilogy, the trilogy,

41:14.440 --> 41:18.760
but when did it originally come out? That was on game. It wasn't Louis. Yeah. Because I had,

41:18.760 --> 41:22.920
yeah, I had the motion controls. What Metro prime three was on the Wii one and one and two,

41:22.920 --> 41:25.880
I think were game cube three was on the Wii. And then they did the trilogy on the Wii.

41:25.880 --> 41:30.120
I think maybe I'm wrong. I thought I played Metro prime three on the Wii,

41:30.120 --> 41:34.040
but maybe I just didn't get on board until, okay. Act F confirms it was on the Wii because

41:34.040 --> 41:37.880
yeah, I thought motion controls were a big part of the Wii. I mean, that was a SC system. So,

41:37.880 --> 41:42.120
I mean, this will look much better anyway. So I'm interested to see what the multiplayer,

41:42.760 --> 41:49.480
um, potential there. I mean that they would take from, uh, what was the one on DS when at first

41:49.480 --> 41:53.720
that was, it was a multiplayer heavy thing on the DS. It was the one that was like the pack-in game.

41:53.720 --> 41:57.080
Yeah. I remember that. I don't remember. It's called, I remember the name of it either,

41:57.080 --> 42:01.160
but I I'm excited to see what they're probably, cause it seems very likely that we'll,

42:01.160 --> 42:04.280
we're going to get multiplayer in this, whatever it's going to be. And that could be,

42:04.280 --> 42:11.240
that could be an e-sport Loki. They hunters prime hunters. Thank you. I knew it wasn't

42:11.240 --> 42:15.240
Federation force. I started to go there, but what was that you said before the show?

42:15.800 --> 42:24.360
Metroid prime for duration force. Yeah. I was going to say, uh, what else did they show?

42:24.360 --> 42:29.880
They showed off was that they, they talked about DLC for Zelda, which is all right. And we knew

42:29.880 --> 42:33.880
that was kind of coming already. So the first piece is I think going to be at the end of this

42:33.880 --> 42:39.000
month. Yeah. It looked pretty hot. The rest is later. Um, they showed off that rocket league

42:39.000 --> 42:44.600
is going to be coming to the switch. There's a part of me that's kind of like, okay, fucking

42:44.600 --> 42:49.800
rocket. Like it's not quite as bad as Skyrim, but I'm like, okay, rocket league is like literally

42:49.800 --> 42:56.760
everywhere else. But then I do think about, okay, but the switch is a really good system for it

42:56.760 --> 43:00.920
with its portability and everything. Like it's kind of one of those. Okay. Yeah. This kind of

43:00.920 --> 43:05.960
has to happen. Like it makes a lot of sense to have rocket league on switch. There was that we

43:05.960 --> 43:10.920
have to backtrack a little bit. It wasn't in there a 30 minute thing, which really blew again. What

43:10.920 --> 43:15.960
the same thing as Sony, a big bombshell that they didn't put in their main presentation.

43:15.960 --> 43:23.560
Not only is there Metroid prime four, there is a Metroid on 3DS, which I thought Nintendo was

43:23.560 --> 43:28.840
going to walk away from 3DS a long time ago to focus on the switch, but clearly no, there is now

43:28.840 --> 43:34.840
a Metroid game that is a remake of Metroid two. That's going to be on the 3DS. And a lot of people

43:34.840 --> 43:41.160
are saying, Oh, that's why they pulled AM2R. No, they pulled AM2R because it was Nintendo period.

43:42.120 --> 43:45.480
In this, it's just a coincidence that they had their own thing in development.

43:45.480 --> 43:52.360
Why that game is not on the switch as well. Like why not? Why can't you develop it for two systems?

43:52.360 --> 43:58.680
I'm kind, in a way I'm with you, but at the same time, I'm like, I am just fucking happy

43:58.680 --> 44:03.720
it's happening. I am fucking happy it's happening and great. I already own a 3DS. Cool. I just hope

44:03.720 --> 44:09.160
it's not a new 3DS exclusive, but nothing they said indicated that. But if it's unique to new

44:09.160 --> 44:15.640
3DS, I'm going to be a little salty. I'm a little salty, but I'll probably finally fucking upgrade

44:15.640 --> 44:22.520
if it is. Cause I want to play it. Yes, it's Metroid. I will do stupid things. The new Yoshi

44:22.520 --> 44:27.480
game that looks kind of like paper Yoshi or something. I mean, yeah, that looked kind of

44:27.480 --> 44:31.160
cool. You know, that Yoshi game did pretty good on Wii U. So they're kind of doing like a spiritual

44:31.160 --> 44:35.720
successor. Act Deft would have your head if you forgot to mention Kirby. No, I was just going to

44:35.720 --> 44:41.640
say that. Yes, that's right. It was new Kirby and that look cute. Uh, and I Kirby, you know,

44:41.640 --> 44:46.440
had some pretty solid entries on the Wii and the Wii U. So, you know, it's, it's logical that the

44:46.440 --> 44:50.520
Switch was getting one. I kind of didn't expect it, but at the same time I was like, Oh yeah,

44:50.520 --> 44:56.360
well this makes sense. Right. So it looked cute. Uh, although 2018, not this holiday.

44:56.360 --> 45:03.480
Yeah. Also absent were additional Wii U remasters. And a lot of people convinced, including myself,

45:04.120 --> 45:08.840
that Smash Brothers was going to be a remaster for this year, but it appears time. I mean,

45:08.840 --> 45:12.840
I don't think they're going to do smash. I think, well, they have the Pokken one that's coming out.

45:12.840 --> 45:18.360
There is Pokken. I kind of think what could have happened is that similar to Splatoon 2,

45:18.360 --> 45:23.000
it might've started as a remaster and somewhere along the line, they've said, you know what,

45:23.560 --> 45:27.800
let's just make it a new game. And so Smash has been tabled for a year or two while they

45:27.800 --> 45:31.480
do that. And that's, you know, as long as it's good, that's all I fucking want.

45:32.440 --> 45:38.920
So, and Bayonetta as a character still would be great as well. So there's that, uh,

45:38.920 --> 45:43.240
Xenoblade Chronicles 2 had some more stuff shown that is a holiday title. We shouldn't forget.

45:43.240 --> 45:49.160
It's an RPG. It was pretty damn good on Wii U, uh, and, and the other one that they had on Wii. So,

45:49.160 --> 45:53.400
um, I don't see why it will be bad on Switch. I'm looking forward to that for sure.

45:53.960 --> 45:59.720
So, uh, there was also Fire Emblem Warriors had a little peek at that and I'm not super into that

45:59.720 --> 46:04.760
series either, but cool. And then some more Amiibo, of course, Breath of the Wild, but the

46:04.760 --> 46:10.600
Metro, the Metroid squishy ones. I like those. The Metroid one looked kind of cool. Um, and then

46:10.600 --> 46:18.120
of course they have Amiibo that ties in with the new Mario Odyssey as well. Um, uh, come on,

46:18.120 --> 46:22.360
Noel Gus in our chat room says, I'm wondering if they're delaying Smash for a year to try to make

46:22.360 --> 46:27.240
arms and esports thing. And we did, I don't know if it's so much the esports thing, although I'm

46:27.240 --> 46:31.240
confident. Yes. Nintendo wants arms to be esports, but all that debate aside,

46:31.880 --> 46:36.040
maybe Nintendo really did kind of take a step back and say, you know what? We've got arms,

46:36.040 --> 46:38.360
we've got poke, and maybe there is too much fighting this year.

46:38.360 --> 46:41.240
Popular arms is going to be first because if there's no one playing it,

46:41.240 --> 46:43.160
you can't have it to be a fucking e-sport.

46:43.160 --> 46:47.080
I it's the people that I know that bought it are enjoying it.

46:47.080 --> 46:51.800
I get it. It's, it's out now with one of the, it's one of the few games that's on the system,

46:51.800 --> 46:56.040
but come like the end of the year when there's Mario and Splatoon shit,

46:56.040 --> 46:58.200
how many people are really going to be playing arms by then?

46:58.200 --> 47:02.920
So I, as you're saying, so let's evaluate how popular arms still is after Mario.

47:03.800 --> 47:10.120
Okay. The legs ha ha. You want to see arms as legs. Yes, I get it. I get it. That's a,

47:10.120 --> 47:13.720
no, that's a good way to put it. So, I mean, cause yeah, I mean, it's popular now,

47:13.720 --> 47:19.160
but like there's not a whole lot of shit out right now for it. So let's just see how that is.

47:19.160 --> 47:25.000
And also let's see what online looks like next year. I mean, cause, but I I'm worried that,

47:25.000 --> 47:29.400
you know, Splatoon that's going to come out and I was like, I forgot all about arms.

47:29.400 --> 47:34.200
I'm playing Splatoon. To be fair to arms, even though I was not thrilled with the demo and I'm

47:34.200 --> 47:37.640
not going to plunk down the asking price for it, but to be fair to it, it does sound like they

47:37.640 --> 47:42.120
plan to support it in a similar method to how they're supporting Overwatch with free DLC

47:42.120 --> 47:46.920
characters, because I know they talked about one this last week. So there is that Loki,

47:46.920 --> 47:52.200
they're trying to give arms legs through DLC. So there is that. All right. And it, it's,

47:52.200 --> 47:56.440
it's worked incredibly well for Overwatch, although that's a whole nother beast.

47:57.400 --> 48:05.320
Blizzard's Overwatch, which probably is esports. Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com

48:05.320 --> 48:13.560
actdeft in chat says Twintelle has legs for days. YYR says, hold on a second. Nintendo is at least

48:13.560 --> 48:17.320
five to 10 years behind the rest of the world, right? Shouldn't they not be due to look into

48:17.320 --> 48:24.440
esports until about 2025? Vidpower in chat says, poor soccer eye. He's so worked to the bone for

48:24.440 --> 48:29.400
so many years making Smash games. I kind of hope they give him a break. And Kaijuto says arms and

48:29.400 --> 48:34.760
Splatoon are not the same kind of game. There is room for both. So we'll, we'll, we will see.

48:35.400 --> 48:41.960
We will see. All right. But I, I was, I was pleased with Nintendo overall, especially the

48:41.960 --> 48:48.440
Metroid things, obviously that made me giddy. Um, and otherwise I think it was, you know, yeah,

48:48.440 --> 48:53.880
I try not to set the bar too high for Nintendo. Right. So I was like, okay, my expectations were

48:53.880 --> 48:58.120
not, I think it's going to do well. They have a solid Mario game coming out. So, I mean,

48:59.720 --> 49:03.480
there's no reason the system is not going to do well through holiday with bad. I mean that,

49:03.480 --> 49:07.800
that alone will sell systems. Yeah. We don't, we don't even know, you know, a lot of what the

49:07.800 --> 49:12.280
online library is going to look like. Again, they didn't spot like too much. I mean, a little bit,

49:12.280 --> 49:15.560
because obviously with rocket league, I do remember, and I don't think it's on our list

49:15.560 --> 49:19.720
here, but like, I know that there's people interviewing Reggie and he dodged all questions

49:19.720 --> 49:22.920
regarding like virtual console and online or anything, but people have to remember,

49:22.920 --> 49:28.040
that's what they do at E3. And that's part of the reason why E3 is kind of a show that I'm,

49:28.040 --> 49:33.080
I personally am kind of over attending because they stay to the script and they will not deviate

49:33.080 --> 49:39.240
from the script at E3. You have to talk to indie publishers, smaller studios, and people that are

49:39.240 --> 49:44.280
very passionate about their game to get them to go off script about the games. Nintendo, Microsoft,

49:44.280 --> 49:49.640
Sony are not going to go off script ever. So people that were trying to get Reggie to go off

49:49.640 --> 49:54.120
script, what the fuck were you expecting to happen? Like, sorry, that's just the real, I know it's

49:54.120 --> 49:59.880
disappointing, but have you not been paying attention to E3 since it landed on the internet

50:00.360 --> 50:01.240
so many years ago?

50:04.520 --> 50:09.080
Just saying. I like how he's like, I'm tired of people asking me about Mother 3. Well then,

50:09.080 --> 50:12.120
you know what? Maybe she'll fucking release it. Well, there's something you could do about that,

50:12.120 --> 50:18.280
you know? Yeah, exactly. I wish I could go a day without people asking me that. I thought I could.

50:18.280 --> 50:22.200
No you didn't. You didn't think that you could. You knew what was fucking going to happen.

50:22.200 --> 50:25.720
Please don't even try to pretend that you didn't know that was going to happen.

50:26.680 --> 50:30.760
All right. Jamie, Misty, anything you guys want to say about Nintendo?

50:32.040 --> 50:35.960
Nothing surprising. But you're still not on board with Switch, right? Not yet?

50:37.320 --> 50:42.760
Not really. Wii U was absent completely, which we, I mean, you have to expect that.

50:42.760 --> 50:48.680
That's not surprising either. Except for its logo did show up with the Breath of the Wild DLC.

50:48.680 --> 50:52.760
Well, of course. That was the one. It's out on that. Yeah, it is. It is. But otherwise,

50:52.760 --> 50:57.400
Nintendo certainly has moved on from Wii U, although not 3DS, which is interesting.

50:57.400 --> 51:03.480
All right. Oh, Act F does point out Wii U does have Just Dance 2018 coming.

51:03.480 --> 51:08.920
They're probably releasing that on the PlayStation 2. Well, no, not anymore,

51:08.920 --> 51:12.760
but probably the PlayStation 3. They usually go back a generation. I mean, they were releasing

51:12.760 --> 51:17.080
that for the Wii, I think, up until like last year. Actually, Act F says it's also coming out

51:17.080 --> 51:24.040
on the Wii. Just Dance 2018 is coming out on the Wii. It's, you know what? The Wii U is backwards.

51:24.040 --> 51:30.840
It's probably the same fucking game that's on the Wii, just in a box that has the Wii U logo on it,

51:30.840 --> 51:35.880
because it's all backwards compatible. Just saying. And it still works for those that have

51:35.880 --> 51:40.600
not upgraded like me. And that is true. You know what? There's still, we have to remember,

51:40.600 --> 51:45.560
we have one perspective because we do this show because we are gamer fans. So we tend to be more

51:45.560 --> 51:49.160
on the quote-unquote cutting edge of games. But there are a lot of households that still

51:49.160 --> 51:53.480
are rocking this. And why not? You know what? Praise Ubisoft for actually fucking publishing

51:53.480 --> 52:00.520
a music game. Because you know what? Who the fuck else is? Let's put it that way. Because Konami,

52:00.520 --> 52:05.000
fucking, unless there's music in fucking pachinko slot machine, they own, but they're not really

52:05.000 --> 52:09.320
producing anything that's like a new... Outside the arcade. Outside the arcade, yeah.

52:10.440 --> 52:14.280
All right. And Kaiju says, don't sleep on those Just Dance games. They're huge.

52:14.360 --> 52:18.600
To go back though, one other thing to kind of go back to, you know, my bitch about like how

52:18.600 --> 52:24.360
publishers are ruining stuff. And also talking about Ubisoft, which we've just briefly touched

52:24.360 --> 52:33.320
on. Are you fucking serious? Ubisoft with an $800 version of fucking Assassin's Creed with a statue

52:33.320 --> 52:39.960
in it? Really? Somebody's buying it. Somebody out there is buying it.

52:39.960 --> 52:41.160
That's fucking retarded.

52:41.640 --> 52:44.200
I... Somebody's buying it. Whatever.

52:44.200 --> 52:49.080
That was almost as retarded as the... I want to say it was Wolfenstein. There was a version

52:49.080 --> 52:54.360
of Wolfenstein, The New Blood that came out. It was a special edition that did not include the

52:54.360 --> 52:58.840
game. I think like Mass Effect Andromeda had a version like that too. It came with the fucking

52:58.840 --> 53:02.120
Mako, but it doesn't come with the game. We saw that at Best Buy the other day and Alan was like,

53:02.120 --> 53:06.280
oh, here's the collector's edition. I said, notice how the box doesn't say any game platform on it.

53:06.280 --> 53:11.880
It doesn't say PS4 or Xbox One because there's no game in it. It's just that fucking Mako thing in

53:11.880 --> 53:15.560
it. And I was like, these things are going to end up on the clearance rack and when it does,

53:15.560 --> 53:25.080
we should go get it. All right. Anyway, let's see. Orange Wright says Namco is still making

53:25.080 --> 53:28.680
music games for home consoles. They have a Taiko on the Switch.

53:28.680 --> 53:33.320
They do. And I think there's actually a PlayStation 4 version that's coming out soon.

53:34.280 --> 53:41.560
PlayStation 4 also got Beat Zonic, Sonic X Beat, Super Beat Zonic. That's it.

53:41.560 --> 53:46.360
Which is that Vita game just came over. So, I mean, there's music games happening out there,

53:46.360 --> 53:51.240
but then we look at Project Rap Rabbit and well, that had its own. I mean,

53:52.680 --> 53:56.760
what a great exhibition and how not to run your Kickstarter. That's all I'm going to say on that.

53:56.760 --> 54:01.720
Like it sucks, but so was how they ran that whole Kickstarter from start to finish.

54:01.720 --> 54:02.600
Oh, I missed that.

54:02.600 --> 54:07.480
Yeah. Well, it just, it was very, it was very arrogant. Like, I'm sorry that

54:07.480 --> 54:10.680
just that Rap Rabbit thing, Red is very arrogant to me.

54:10.680 --> 54:12.040
Did they not make their Kickstarter?

54:12.040 --> 54:16.840
Oh, they're not going to. I don't know if it's over yet, but it was nowhere close when I last

54:16.840 --> 54:20.600
checked. Why haven't these public or these like developers learn like, you know, I'm famous

54:20.600 --> 54:25.000
because I made this game. I'm going to put out a game and everybody's going to love it. You know,

54:25.000 --> 54:31.560
that only worked for Inafune, or was it, I'm sorry, I'm getting names confused.

54:31.560 --> 54:34.920
Who was it that did Bloodstained? Is that Inafune? That's not Inafune.

54:34.920 --> 54:35.480
Igarashi.

54:35.480 --> 54:38.920
Igarashi. I'm sorry. And it was with an I. Igarashi's.

54:38.920 --> 54:40.600
Yeah, but Bloodstained looks really fucking good.

54:40.600 --> 54:43.880
It does look fucking good, but like Inafune thought that they could do that with, you know,

54:43.880 --> 54:49.000
Mighty No. 9 and then it ended up sucking. And then now, you know, they're thinking they're

54:49.000 --> 54:50.360
going to be all cocky with this stuff.

54:50.360 --> 54:57.640
This project, okay, Rap Rabbit has 20 hours to go out of the 1 million and 92,

54:57.640 --> 55:01.480
1 million plus goal. It's 1 million 92,000 because of the currency conversion.

55:01.480 --> 55:04.840
They have made about $200,000. They've made 20%.

55:05.560 --> 55:09.800
They haven't, they have backers. It's, this is more proving that people want the game and well,

55:10.440 --> 55:12.520
sorry, I guess it's not going to happen.

55:12.520 --> 55:14.520
Yeah, it's, it's, it's an ouch.

55:14.520 --> 55:18.440
Perhaps if you sold more $800 collector's editions, you'd hit that goal.

55:18.440 --> 55:21.880
Well, perhaps if you hadn't come out saying making music games great again,

55:21.880 --> 55:27.480
and then not showing any gameplay concept until two thirds of the way through your Kickstarter

55:27.480 --> 55:33.000
project, maybe you would have had a different result. And, you know, this whole thing has

55:33.000 --> 55:36.920
been trying to be sold. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I'm going off right now, but it's just,

55:36.920 --> 55:43.080
as a music game fan, it's very, very disappointing to me. And I feel like a lot of this was that, oh,

55:43.080 --> 55:47.720
we're the folks that made Elite Beat Agents and, you know, we made Parappa the Rappa.

55:47.720 --> 55:52.280
And so this is the game we're going to make next dah, dah, dah, dah. These guys need to realize

55:52.280 --> 56:00.760
that Inafune, Mega Man and Mighty No. 9 ruined it for them. They need to be able to show a lot

56:00.760 --> 56:06.760
more coming out the gate than, well, we made this, so we're going to make this great. Sorry,

56:06.760 --> 56:11.240
that ain't going to work anymore. It's just not. It's not.

56:11.240 --> 56:15.800
Yeah, because Inafune, just because you have a good pedigree doesn't mean that

56:15.800 --> 56:17.240
you're going to always make great games.

56:17.320 --> 56:20.040
And you can thank Mighty No. 9 for the reason why this flopped.

56:20.760 --> 56:21.560
Yeah.

56:21.560 --> 56:30.600
So, sorry, it's harsh. But I hope they find a way to make it happen otherwise. But I just don't

56:30.600 --> 56:35.720
think it's going to at this point. I think the 20% is so bad that I don't know how they're going to

56:35.720 --> 56:36.200
do it. But I feel like-

56:36.200 --> 56:41.560
Was it Amplitude like that too? Like, remember, like, harmonics? Did that make it school pretty

56:41.560 --> 56:42.440
fast or-

56:42.440 --> 56:47.400
No, it had, like, a big out the gate and then it really struggled and it looked like it was

56:47.400 --> 56:52.520
going to be questionable. And then they kind of made it at the last second. So it was a little

56:52.520 --> 56:52.840
different.

56:52.840 --> 56:56.120
I know it's- I don't think it's on our show, but I know that Comcept actually just joined

56:56.120 --> 56:59.000
their subsidiary now of Level 5. So-

56:59.000 --> 57:02.680
Actually, I think you did have that story later on. So you might want to talk about that later.

57:02.680 --> 57:04.840
We'll talk about it later on.

57:04.840 --> 57:05.880
All right, we'll clear-

57:05.880 --> 57:06.600
Spoiler!

57:06.600 --> 57:10.360
Spoiler alert! Well, if you guys all read the gaming blogs, you already know anyway.

57:10.360 --> 57:13.880
All right, let's move on. We have some more gaming news we want to cover. But of course,

57:13.880 --> 57:17.240
we got to talk about our gaming weeks and what were the types of video games that we

57:17.240 --> 57:18.680
have been playing this week.

57:19.480 --> 57:20.840
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

57:21.800 --> 57:28.200
It was kind of non-existent this week. Actually, I've been playing- Crap, what's the game called

57:28.200 --> 57:34.760
again? Since I've been on my big Dragon Ball kick lately, I downloaded that game on iOS,

57:35.720 --> 57:41.240
Dokkan Battle. And it's kind of neat. It's very flashy as I expect it to be. I haven't

57:41.240 --> 57:48.040
gotten too far in it. And I've also been playing that Sailor Moon Sailor Drops. It's actually

57:48.040 --> 57:50.360
kind of fun. It's like Bejeweled on crack.

57:50.360 --> 57:54.440
Yeah, I think Alan was into that, the Japanese version on his phone. I think that's the same

57:54.440 --> 57:54.840
one.

57:54.840 --> 57:57.480
Pretty much. It's just the text that's been translated into English.

57:57.480 --> 57:57.880
Right.

57:57.880 --> 58:02.760
But I think it's like international server. So it's got all the original voices and everything.

58:02.760 --> 58:03.320
It's okay.

58:03.320 --> 58:03.820
Sure.

58:04.760 --> 58:11.880
And I actually haven't even touched WoW, except for doing my dailies on my phone. And then

58:11.880 --> 58:17.320
I ran out of resources. So I might have to log in and do a few things to get some more

58:17.320 --> 58:27.400
resources. But I'm waiting until they release the new raid for LFR. And then I might do

58:27.400 --> 58:33.720
that. The whole Sargeras raid. So we'll see how that goes. Other than that, I'm on the

58:33.720 --> 58:37.480
fence for a game I want to buy. Again, because of my big Dragon Ball kick.

58:38.120 --> 58:46.680
I really am thinking about getting Xenoverse 2. It looks fun. I like the MMO without being

58:46.680 --> 58:51.320
an MMO thing. Because most of the time, you know how I am on most games. I'll play by

58:51.320 --> 58:56.040
myself. I'm not really super social with that. I just like talking to people. So I think

58:56.040 --> 58:59.160
it would be fun and it would be right up my alley. I just don't know anyone who's played

58:59.160 --> 59:03.000
it. So I'm looking. Let me know if y'all have a favorable impression.

59:03.800 --> 59:08.760
Or not. Before I drop 80 bucks on it. Well, because I'd be getting all the DLC at the

59:08.760 --> 59:16.920
same time. Other than that, I've watched 60 episodes of Dragon Ball Super. That's what

59:16.920 --> 59:22.200
I've been doing with my life. And the Drag Race reunion, which just annoyed me to no end.

59:23.080 --> 59:26.680
You're the fan favorite. Yay, fan favorite. Yay, fan favorite.

59:28.280 --> 59:32.200
Everyone applaud for the fan favorite. Thank you, Farrah Moan.

59:34.200 --> 59:36.840
I laughed my ass off during that. Just gonna plug this week's episode

59:36.840 --> 59:41.000
of Reading is Fundamental. It'll be fun. Although the thing, to sidestep a bit,

59:41.000 --> 59:45.240
the thing that made me laugh was the reading back and forth with Trinity and Eureka. And

59:45.240 --> 59:47.960
I'm so excited Eureka's on next season. All right.

59:47.960 --> 59:49.800
Okay, done. All right, wrong show. All right,

59:49.800 --> 59:54.600
Loki, how was your gaming week? So this week I was trying to play some different things,

59:54.600 --> 59:59.480
but I ended up playing some of the same things. So I played actually Skyrim a little bit last

59:59.480 --> 01:00:05.000
night. I was playing through Skyrim. I was doing some quests and stuff. I just finished up

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:11.560
doing one of the quests for, oh God, I don't remember now. It was,

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:18.920
oh, it doesn't matter. But I was playing through Skyrim and then of course it crashed. Well,

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:23.960
it didn't crash. It broke in a very unique way. So my whole screen is black unless I paused the

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:28.840
game and then I could see what was on the screen, but I couldn't do anything with that. So, you

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:35.160
is that point that I kind of have the realization, I always say I like Bethesda games because they're

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.960
buggy and glitchy and stuff. I don't think that's the case really. I think I'm kind of tired of

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:44.840
their games being so fucking broken. I like that they're quirky sometimes. And that's any game

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:50.600
really is quirky, but when your game is fundamentally broken and you're just not fixing

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:57.000
it and instead you're coming up with concepts to monetize user-made content, I have a little bit

01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:01.720
of a problem with that. And that's kind of where I'm at with that, but that's my realization.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:07.080
So I went back to playing the other game I was playing this week, which is Minecraft on

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:12.440
PlayStation 4. Just, eh, I just decided I'm going to just play survival for a little bit and so I

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:20.120
did that and it was relaxing. Then of course the other stuff I played, I tried the Marvel vs Capcom

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:27.560
Infinite demo that they have, the story demo, and I was kind of on the fence with that game

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:32.840
as it was. And that demo did not fucking help. I am not purchasing that game.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:38.520
Was not very good at all. The characters are all right. I forgot to get it. The characters are

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:43.640
all right, but that demo, it was just, and I get it. It's a story mode, so there's supposed to be

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:48.600
cut scenes, but it's just like cut scene, cut scene, cut scene, cut scene, boring ass fight,

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.600
cut scene. I'm a little worried. I'm a little worried for Capcom. I'm a little worried for

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:58.440
Capcom. Granted, Resident Evil 7, people are loving. No, that looks fantastic. But other

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:03.640
one than that, I'm a little worried for Capcom right now. It's just, you know, honestly looking

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:08.680
at the roster of characters that were going to be in there, it wasn't all that exciting to me

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:14.920
that much. I mean, it was, I wanted to check it out and I did, and I'm just not feeling it.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:21.640
I thought Marvel versus Capcom 3 was way better roster wise. It was more interesting characters.

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:28.200
And I guess maybe later on down the line, you know, with all the DLC that they'll be pumping

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:32.040
out that I'm sure interesting characters will come out, but that's going to be a couple of years from

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:36.280
now by the time that, you know, more interesting characters. And by then, I'm just not going to

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:40.680
want to play it and I don't want to play it now. So I'm just not going to pick it up. All right.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:46.680
And then of course, you know, mobile wise, I've been playing, you know, my usual Pokemon go and

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:52.840
clicker game. I almost, I didn't do it because I saw it came out this week. I almost downloaded

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:59.640
Garfield go because that's a thing now. Wait, Garfield go? Garfield go. Yes. It's like a

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:08.200
Pokemon go rip off with Garfield and it is absolutely terrible. So you go around, you

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:13.480
collect, you gotta find lasagna and avoid normal. No, no, no, no, no, no. You're right.

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:19.960
Guess what? So, you know, Pokemon. I mean, yes, I do know how you have to flick the balls at the

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:25.240
Pokemon to try to catch them. Yes. And put in Garfield go, you have to flick lasagna into

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:30.760
Garfield's dish and they have the whole AR shit and everything. And you collect and you go around

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:35.560
and you find comic books, like old comic book panels that they have and stuff. And on top of

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:40.920
that though, apparently you can win actual like real money prizes, like gift cards and crap.

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.800
But I mean, come on, honestly, you're never going to be able to do that because they're going to

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:48.840
have somehow limited, but yes, that's Garfield go. It looks like such a, I'm going, I'm going,

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:55.560
I'm going balls deep on Garfield go. Let's do this. Let's do a tournament. It is fucking on

01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:02.520
Garfield go motherfuckers. This is the next big thing in gaming. It's an e-sport.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:07.000
It is. So that's it. That was my week.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.760
Misty care to follow that up. How was your gaming week? Maybe you can play some Garfield go on the

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:19.880
trains as you're heading, heading back East. He's she's got it up on her phone. I love it.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:25.560
I need to investigate how bad it is. I'm telling you, I'm telling you. It is on. It is on. All

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:28.760
right. Uh, Misty, how was, uh, how was your gaming week? What have you been up to?

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:34.760
Mm, considering being in transit half the time, mostly Pokemon go. I mean,

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:40.120
where the hell did my nickname come from after all? Right. You are the leader of the water gym.

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:47.320
But, but yes, I did. I did end up at round one, so pretty much any games you can find there.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:54.760
Notable exceptions of the project diva game that I seem to remember seeing and two DX.

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:59.720
I mainly concentrated on pop and music and, and of course DDR.

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:06.680
Uh, what about, uh, our trip to, uh, stars yesterday? I thought you, you would, uh,

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:11.080
because you got to play you beat and what else we played DDR. We played around a DDR together.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:16.280
Yes, we did. And you watched me pass Orion seven, eight, which was a nine footer back in the day,

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:20.680
but at some point they gave it more feet. It's a 12 footer now. And my old man asked past that.

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:24.840
Thank you very much. I'm going to be that 40 year old DDR player up on the machine.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.840
Not giving a fuck that the other people playing are old enough to be my kids.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:34.200
Hey, at least your old man ass doesn't have an doesn't have any knee problems that I know of.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:38.040
That's why my ass has been sticking to beginner jumps off.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.880
All right. Anything else for gaming week you want to share?

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:49.560
I did do a few songs of obligatory step mania on a train, but that's all I'm thinking of off hand.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:56.680
Alright. Um, my gaming week, I will talk about, uh, so I went to the arcade with Misty and played

01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:01.960
some more neon FM, which I'm, I'm enjoying. Uh, and as you play in the arcade, you rake up a bunch

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:06.440
of credits that you can use on the phone to play songs for free. So that part's if you log into

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:10.200
the game. So don't forget, like if you are interested in neon FM, like make an account

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:15.000
and log in cause you get free, uh, currency stuff when you play in the arcade. So don't forget that.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.240
Uh, and I've been enjoying that, but otherwise, uh, big stuff that I've been playing this week.

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:25.880
I have, um, been checking out the newest final fantasy 14 expansion that had its soft launch

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:32.680
on Friday or the early access. I guess the official launch is not until Monday or Tuesday,

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:37.400
but the early access launch was on Friday and I'm not going to lie. It's it, it, it was a

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:44.600
fucking mess and a little bit of an embarrassment for Square Enix, how bad they kind of screwed up,

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:50.200
the launch of storm blood. Because, um, what happened basically is that in the main story

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:54.280
quest, when you want to progress characters, you know, past level 60 to level 70 and experience

01:06:54.280 --> 01:07:00.520
the new story, everything got, um, held up where there is this, um, scene that you had to play what

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:05.240
they call a solo instance where you do a fight by yourself, basically, uh, that's similar to a

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:08.440
dungeon, but it's like a solo experience. And what was happening is that so many people were hitting

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:14.520
it that the servers couldn't handle it. And so maybe like one person out of the thousands that

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:19.560
were trying to get in would get in at a time. And so so many people could not progress the story.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:23.560
And I was actually streaming this on my Twitch. You can see it actually happened to me towards the end

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:27.880
of the stream that I was doing for two and a half hours. But, um, it was, it was pretty rotten that

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:35.000
that went on for over two days after the launch and then they finally fixed it overnight. So now

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:41.000
that I'm past that, the game's fantastic. Like the story is great. And some of the cut scenes

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.560
so far have made me go like they've been like really like twisting and turning and that stuff.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:50.440
So, you know, now that I'm past all that, it's, it's fantastic. But, um, that was very, very

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:56.680
disappointing, uh, that they did not like pull the servers down sooner to try to fix it or do any

01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:03.400
sort of testing whatsoever. It was a little bit of a black mark. Um, but otherwise now that I think

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:07.720
we're past it, it's probably one of those things everybody will forget in a few weeks because I'm

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:11.800
sure the story and the expansion is good enough and strong enough to really carry the game.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:18.680
But I just feel like the creators of said story and said game did not deserve how screwed they

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:23.720
got by those network issues. But that also is partially in the design of what were they thinking

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:28.120
funneling all these people through a solo instance so early on, you know, they should have done it

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:32.120
later in the story when people are getting there at different times. It was a little,

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:37.160
it was a bad, bad decision on Square's part. But anyway, it's fine now. And that's the important

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:42.600
part, I suppose. Um, during some of the downtime, I finally, I was on my PlayStation four and I was

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:45.880
just kind of catching up on some of the backlog. So I checked out this free to play game. I

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:50.680
downloaded a while ago called paladins. Have you heard of this? Yes, I have. And I've actually,

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:55.720
they're overwatchy. I kind of wanted to try it because it looked all right. I mean, it granted,

01:08:55.720 --> 01:09:00.040
it looks like kind of a rip off of Overwatch, but a lot of people are playing it. Yeah, it's,

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:06.840
it's, uh, it's definitely in, I mean, it's hard to say because, you know, it's inspired. I mean,

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:11.960
granted, this game had to have been in development long before Overwatch was out. Like it takes too

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:16.760
much to make a video game, but I'm sorry when I look at that and some of the abilities that some

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:21.560
of the people have and like, like seriously, the tank in paladins like had a fucking Reinhardt

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:24.840
shield from like, I just like it, there was a little curve shield and everything. And I'm like,

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:29.560
some of these abilities I think are kind of like right out of Overwatch, but keep in mind,

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:33.560
shield designs tend to be fairly universal for the type of shield. That's true. And who knows,

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:38.040
you know, and this could all be borrowed from team forgers two, which I didn't really play enough of

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:42.520
to be fair. I mean, mercy is a lot like the medic in team forgers two. So it's not like these games

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:46.600
haven't borrowed from each other before. And you know, um, I enjoyed what I played at paladins.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:51.560
There's a lot to explore in the free to play currency, uh, because you can't play every

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:55.880
character right out the gate and they just hate them out. Yeah. And there's also like, there's

01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:00.040
these, there's these cards that look like magic cards that could actually change abilities. And

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:03.720
that's something that to be fair, Overwatch doesn't really have, you can't really like

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:09.320
alter your abilities on the characters through some of the loot that you get.

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:16.200
So there are some very different things that paladin's doing, but you know, it's a calling it

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:22.200
an Overwatch inspired game is not a bad way to think about it. If like, is this a game I want

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:27.720
to get into or not? So, um, stopping and chat says, I want to try it, but I hear it has a lot

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:32.760
of grinding and too much pay to win. And well, it's free to try. And I just, I went in and did

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:36.600
some AI matches and I was like, Oh, this is all right. This is, this is fun. This is a good time

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:41.560
waster. So I don't think I'm going to sit there and drop 50 bucks on it, but I can see why people

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:46.680
get into it. It actually, actually, I would say to be fair, especially in the art style,

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:51.400
it does remind me more of team fortress two in a lot of ways, even than it does Overwatch.

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:57.000
So, you know, which is what both games really probably just can't come up with a team fortress

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:04.200
three. They're allergic to three. Anyway. Um, one other thing I want to give a quick shout out to

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:08.680
is, uh, he was in chat earlier, but I guess he left at some point, but my buddy Gabe from

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:14.440
nascent games, uh, did a little show and tell for, uh, crumple, which is like super duper close to

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:19.400
getting released, I guess now at this point. And, uh, so I got to, I played it on Amazon fire.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:22.360
Cause I wanted to see what it was like on the tablet. Cause you know, I'd seen it,

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:26.040
I'd played it before when he had it on a PC at one of those gaming shows.

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:31.160
I tried it on a tablet and, um, yeah, I mean, I'm excited for him for the game to finally launch.

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:35.320
So congrats to him. Uh, I guess it is finally coming out next month, but there are a couple

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:39.400
other things he's, you know, I gave him some feedback on how I felt about his finished product.

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:42.520
And I think there are a couple of things he's thinking about implementing over the next month.

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:46.440
So that'll be out very soon. And it gave me an opportunity to check out that space.

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:49.560
Remember when him and Bree were here last time they were talking about like the square one,

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:55.160
which is like, it's like not to give away where I live, but it's like just down the street is not

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:59.480
that far from here at all. So I was, I was pleasantly surprised by that and they've got

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:04.680
a nice little thing going there. So, um, I'm very happy for them. It's like, it's like going into

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:10.840
like a shared office space, but it's, it's very hip. I don't know how else to describe it. Cause

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:16.200
I only got to see the, the, I haven't, I haven't worked there. I've only experienced the, uh,

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:22.280
little media event he had there. So, but it's, it's, it's like, it's like they took a converted

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:27.400
office basically, and they're converting it to this, you know, this office is for NASA and games,

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:31.960
this office is for somebody else who wants to rent it. And there's these other spaces where people

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:36.040
can, you know, collaborate and do stuff too. And there's a little classroom in the back where they

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:40.360
can do like, you know, their, um, development panels and things that they do. Yeah. They're

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:45.000
aggressive. I feel like when we have, I'll let them explain it better. Next time we either have

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.360
him or Brie back on the show, we'll let them explain it better probably than I can do,

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:52.760
but it was just, it was nice to go there and see the growing game development scene in Sacramento

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:57.720
is always a pleasant thing. So it was very happy to do that. So, and I see Brie is actually in

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:01.080
chat tonight and gave me a heart. So thank you very much. Heart's right back at you.

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:06.680
All right. Uh, let's, um, move on. I think that's, uh, that's really all I have to say

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:13.000
about my gaming week. Um, yeah, so we got news to cover other stuff besides just E3 and 15

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:19.800
years and gave me weeks. So Loki start us off, please. Yes. Um, so IO interactive has finally

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:26.360
left, um, square Enix. They, you know, basically said that, you know, Hey, we're, we're independent

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:34.680
now. Um, and the best part about it is they also are keeping the rights to hit man. So that is

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:38.840
still their franchise, which is kind of cause you see sometimes, you know, when these companies get

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:43.240
bought by other companies that, you know, they don't retain the rights to some of those games

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:48.600
and then the new owner hangs onto it for all time, never to do anything with it. Yeah. Yeah.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:53.320
So it is nice to see that, you know, they're going to be able to do their own thing,

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:59.000
maybe with another, um, you know, publishing partner. So yeah, I mean, that's pretty cool.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:04.680
And he said, you know, it's 19 year history IO interactive has, um, you know, brought out lots

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:08.840
of different games. And they said that, you know, from many ninjas, the freedom fighters,

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:17.640
and of course, Kane and Lynch and agent 47 and hit man. So, um, you know, they've, I don't know,

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:20.920
they're going to be independent now. So it'd be cool to see what they're going to be working on

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:24.840
next. Well, since you're very anti publisher tonight, Loki, this should be good news for them,

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:28.040
right? Cause now they'll be able to do whatever the fuck they want. Nice to have flexibility

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:31.160
about what, you know, where you're going to publish with and they don't have to do their

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:35.640
game episodic if they don't like, although, although people didn't seem to dislike that

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:41.480
for hit man. So maybe they'll keep it. Who knows? Yeah, that'd be interesting. So I'm curious to

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:46.680
see what happens in the future with them. So at E3, a lot of people were talking about the

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:50.840
Minecraft 4k, right? But then the other announcement that Minecraft was going to be

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:54.680
cross platform and they actually had the, the switch was in there and it was going to be

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:59.320
cross platform across the tablets, PC switch, all that stuff. But you know what was missing y'all

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:07.240
was Sony PlayStation and uh, yeah. Um, apparently Microsoft was trying to talk to Sony about it.

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:11.480
And uh, let's see, there was a tweet from Minecraft spokesperson Aubrey Norris, uh,

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:17.800
over on Twitter. Wasn't she with, uh, yeah. THQ. She was with Devolver 1.1. She, um, I don't

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:21.880
remember if she was a Devolver, but I know she's a THQ. She, we, we used to get emails from her

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:26.440
all the time. I met her at 1E3. Um, and um, cause I just remember her doing a lot of like

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:32.040
the volition stuff. Yes, it was volition. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It was THQ. That's it. That's

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:37.480
it. Okay. And uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat follows that up. She was never a Devolver. She was a THQ

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.960
and volition. Sorry. My bad. My bad. My bad. I can't, I can't, I, these companies probably

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:45.480
can't keep their own personnel straight. Let alone me. So anyway, but I, I just remember

01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:49.080
the name sounded very familiar to you cause she wrote the most hilarious emails to promote all

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:54.040
this stuff. She's very good at getting attention, but anyway, best in PR now she's Minecraft,

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:57.560
which you know, is obviously that, uh, that franchise. And she went on Twitter and said,

01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:02.040
we'd love to have PlayStation players along with the unified Minecraft hope that we can.

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:07.240
So apparently this went on to the fact that this is something that PlayStation is pushing back on

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:12.840
a little bit. And this is a little bit true with rocket league as well. And a Eurogamer actually

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:16.920
did an interview with Jim Ryan, whose PlayStation global sales and marketing had to say,

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:22.120
Minecraft's got this rocket league's got this. What's going on as Sony not playing ball.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:26.680
Jim Ryan said, it's certainly not a profound philosophy stance we have against this philosophical

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:30.920
stance. Excuse me. We've done it in the past. We're always open to conversations with any

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:34.600
developer or publisher who wants to talk about it. Unfortunately, it's a commercial discussion

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:37.960
between ourselves and other stakeholders. And I'm not going to get into the detail

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.920
of that on this particular instance. And I can see your eyes rolling.

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:47.240
And then a Eurogamer went on to clarify that, you know, obviously they're upset. They want to

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:51.160
play with switch owners and so forth. And Jim Ryan continued, we've got to be mindful of our

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:55.400
responsibility to our install base Minecraft, the demographic playing that, you know, as well as I

01:16:55.400 --> 01:17:00.440
do, it's all ages, but also very young. We have a contract with the people who go online with us

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:04.840
that we look after them and they are within the PlayStation curated universe exposing what in

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:08.920
many cases are children to external influences. We have no ability to manage or look after.

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:12.760
It's something we have to think about very carefully. So, what I'm taking away from this

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:19.560
is that he's saying basically, if a child were to go into a match or whatever with a Microsoft

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:27.080
player and that Microsoft player draws penises out of Minecraft blocks, then heaven forbid that child

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:36.200
saw a digital penis and it was Microsoft that enabled said penising and not Sony because Sony

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:41.320
would have been unable to police that because Sony police is so much on their network as it is.

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:46.360
That's kind of what I took away from it. But then you go, okay, there's a part of me that said,

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:51.080
all right, well, what is cross-play on Sony? Final Fantasy 14 is obviously the first one that comes

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:58.520
to mind for me. If you want to go further back, Final Fantasy 11 was huge because that was

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:05.480
Microsoft, Sony and PC, 360, PlayStation 2 and PC. We're all in on that. But then I kind of go,

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:12.440
well, okay, but Square Run uses its own game masters. And so there's GMs that, you know,

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:16.040
can moderate this type of stuff. So I guess, okay, it is a little different. But what about Street

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:20.200
Fighter V? What about Street Fighter V? That's the other big cross-play thing I think of. There's no

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:24.840
GMs in that. Is that just because kids don't play Street Fighter or because Street Fighter is an

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:29.240
M-rated game? I don't think it's their excuses why, you know, I don't think it has anything to

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:36.120
do with kids. So, like, I don't remember, like, back last year when they made the announcement,

01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:40.200
who made the announcement about cross-platform. And it was actually Microsoft saying that they're

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:46.120
going to allow Xbox gamers to play against PlayStation 4 and PC players. But I don't think,

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:49.880
and then Sony, of course, responded back to that saying, well, PlayStation has been supporting

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:56.280
cross-platform play between PC and on several software titles, including Final Fantasy 11 on

01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:01.160
PlayStation 2 and PC back in 2002. It's like, ha-ha, we did it first. Of course, they were

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:06.760
saying, you know, we would be happy to have the conversation with any publisher or developers who

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:13.640
are interested in cross-platform play. That was last year. This year, probably because they're,

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:18.440
as Bobby put, so ahead of the game, there's nothing really for them to gain on this.

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:24.680
Aside from disappointing, you know, people that do, like, you and me, like, and most, like,

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:30.200
gamers out there, dude, we're not your fucking company, okay? For us, you know, to lose the

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:34.680
ability to play with our friends on different platforms is kind of a disappointment. I get it,

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:38.600
you're company, and this is, like, an advantage for you because you're ahead of the game. But

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:44.200
that shit shifts all the time. It's still disappointing that you're being petty about this.

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:50.440
If you want to talk 2006 E3 for a minute, those were very different times when Sony would have

01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:56.680
begged for this sort of thing. So, don't get cocky, y'all, haven't we? Ask Rap Rabbit about

01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:03.480
that one. I just, I'm surprised, like, I get it. It's about business and about the bottom line,

01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:07.480
but, like, can't these companies come together and say, hey, you know what? This is a cool idea.

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:11.640
Let's see if we can implement cross-platform play amongst all these different platforms

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:16.680
so that we can benefit the players. But, oh, fuck that. No, money, money. I need my money.

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:22.840
Pay for that PlayStation Plus and the Xbox Live. If I were to take Jim Brian at face value on what

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:29.000
he's saying here, then I would think this could be solved as follows. Don't let the PlayStation

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:34.600
people play with Xbox or Switch or any of the other stuff until they acknowledge a disclaimer

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:41.000
that says you are leaving the PlayStation Network and Sony does not moderate and cannot be held

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.640
liable for what you're about to see or whatever that. Or restrict it to 18 and up if you want.

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:50.680
Don't let accounts with birthdays prior to whatever's 18 up. Don't let him use it. Lock

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:55.080
the under 18 crowd out. Sorry, but, you know, if that's what it's going to take to get the

01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:59.640
rest of us on board, then do it. All of like any game that has online says, you know, online,

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:05.560
the online portion is unrated. It's not rated by the ESRB. So you may see dicks. I mean,

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:12.120
that's warning dicks. Ahoy. How boring.

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:19.240
That's that's all we need is everybody's getting into the, you know, the pirate game,

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:23.160
you know, thing that's the new popular thing. That's the devolver digital tie right there.

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:32.680
Dicks Ahoy! I can see it now. Isn't that like a porn star's name? Dixie Hoy. If not,

01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:35.400
that should be a drag queen's name. Dixie Hoy.

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:46.040
Patent pending. Trademark. I'm sure that there's got to be a Dixie Wrecked. I'm sure that's

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:52.360
well, I know there's also Dixie Normous. So I did see like kind of on tangent here,

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:57.480
since we're talking about weird names for things, I did see that someone has used the power of

01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:03.720
machine learning to name guinea pigs. And so this machine can look at a guinea pig

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:07.640
and come up with a name. Why is it anyway? Can't do that for babies?

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:12.440
Well, yeah, I guess you could. I mean, if you want to name them gerbil names or whatever,

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:16.920
or like hamster names or guinea pig names, whatever. But like, why can't we be using

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:22.040
machine learning for like naming drag queens? I mean, or porn stars or really anything.

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:27.160
I'm pretty sure for some season of Drag Race, Logo TV had, well, we already have a machine.

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:34.200
It's the name of your first pet plus the street you grew up on is your drag queen name.

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:38.040
That's also a way to get people's security questions.

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:40.200
That's right. So you got to be careful what you post on Facebook. That's why I'm not going

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:44.360
to answer that question here on OLR. But yeah, sometimes those things are little tricks. But

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:50.760
anyway, moving on. Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:59.880
Well, this, you know, I'm gonna say right now, this might sound really weird to at least those

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:06.520
of us, at least in America, where it's illegal to do something like this. But Konami has been,

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:13.320
well, the report is that they are allegedly blacklisting their ex employees in the Japanese

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:19.240
video game industry. So basically, the ones in particular that they're targeting are people that

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:30.280
worked for Kojima Productions. What it was actually printed in Nikkei Asian Review, that

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:40.440
there was a Kojima Productions executive who applied for Kojima to join ITS Kenpo, which is

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:45.560
an insurance company that focuses on the gaming industry and the application was denied

01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:53.240
because the the chair of that company's board is also a board member at Konami.

01:23:53.800 --> 01:24:06.280
It's Kimihiko Higashio. So there's a lot of evidence, but it's not confirmed. But

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:13.000
and of course, it was asked of Konami US and there was no reply.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:20.440
Well, the US is also different rules anyway. So it's likely that if this is true, and we should

01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:25.640
say allegedly, well, there's all Japan. There's another quote in here from the article from Nikkei

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:33.000
Asian Review is that they have, they're apparently not allowed to put their Konami experience on

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:38.120
their public resume. And it was quoted saying, if you leave the company, you cannot reply,

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:44.600
on Konami's name to land a job. Well, to be there with my LinkedIn profile.

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:51.880
And if an ex-Konami employee is interviewed by the media, the company will send them a letter

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:57.880
through a legal representative about whatever they say about it. So take it as you will.

01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:00.600
So this is to stop people from bad mouthing it, basically.

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:04.520
Exactly. Which, of course, we know here in the US, highly illegal.

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:10.360
Right. So you're really not trying that hard not to be dicks, right?

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:18.920
All right. It's my how the mighty have fallen. Bobby Black Wolf chat asks,

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:22.840
is Konami run by the Yakuza now? Like seriously, serious question. Is it?

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:33.560
Probably not. But I wouldn't be surprised. I know. Right. It's sad. It's sad.

01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:37.720
Moving on. Happy Loki, right? Or more sad. More sad?

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:48.440
More sad. So there was a Rockstar had sent a cease and desist to modding software called Open 4.

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:53.320
And Open 4 has been around forever since, you know, for being grand theft out of four

01:25:53.320 --> 01:26:00.200
is one of the pieces of software that I used at one time to unarchive some other files and stuff

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:05.400
and, you know, help mod the game and everything. And, you know, this has been around for like 10

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:12.680
years now and people use it for a lot of things. Now, currently Open 4 is closed software, so you

01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:19.080
can't like really see the code for it. And they were putting things in place where if you were

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:26.680
using Open 4, you wouldn't be able to mod online. It was mainly for offline purposes. You could

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:32.920
use it to, you know, change out models and stuff like that. And so really kind of benign stuff.

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:41.480
But nonetheless, they went ahead and put it out there. And I guess Take 2 has followed up with

01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:47.720
this because people are not happy one bit about it because you're essentially killing, you know,

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:52.120
single-player modding. And so they said, you know, Take 2's actions were not specifically

01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:57.240
targeting single-player mods. Unfortunately, Open 4 enables recent malicious mods that allow

01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:03.400
harassment of players and airfield grand theft auto online experiences for everybody. We're

01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:08.280
working to figure out a way we can continue to support the creative community without negatively

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:13.640
impacting our players, which is a big fucking line of bullshit because it does not work online.

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:21.240
There's no way to use it for online modding, period. So that is a bunch of bullshit. And to

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:27.400
go along with that, you know, once again, GoodNTS, the guy that actually made the software,

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:35.640
he's responded to it as well, saying, you know, Open 4, Liberty City, and GTA 5, and all other

01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:42.680
mods slash projects from my team and me are only specific for single-player. Rockstar must be aware

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:49.160
about the fact that you cannot access GTA Online while you have installed any Open 4 mod. And he

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:54.200
even posted a screenshot, basically says, alert, you are attempting to access GTA Online servers

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:59.320
with an altered version of the game returning to Grand Theft Auto 5. It literally blocks you from

01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:05.080
playing online. This is a statement, unfortunately, Open 4 enables recent malicious mods that allow

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:09.720
harassment of players and airfield grand theft auto online experiences for everybody. It's just

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:16.920
wrong and they know it. Open 4 does not allow or support any kind of GTA Online mods. We always

01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:22.920
supported Rockstar in their right to protect GTA Online from hacks and cheats, but Take-Two C and D

01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:28.760
was specific for our single-player mods and have no mentions about Grand Theft Auto Online.

01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:35.880
Then on top of that, not only were they forced to take stuff down, but actually there was some

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:42.760
other C synthesis for actual Grand Theft Auto Online mods. So one of those was Forks Hacks,

01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:48.360
which is a mod menu that you can use in Grand Theft Auto Online that actually required a $15

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:56.360
a month fee to access it. And what's kind of funny with that is basically they were, it says,

01:28:56.360 --> 01:29:00.360
after discussions with Take-Two Interactive, effective immediately, we are ceasing all

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:05.080
maintenance, development, and distribution of the Forks Hacks cheap menu service. We will be donating

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:10.200
our proceeds to charity and we apologize for all problems, Forks Hacks services of cost to the

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:15.400
Grand Theft Auto community. So they are kind of cleaning the house along with that lexicon and

01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:21.800
menu tools have also been posted statements basically receiving a C synthesis as well.

01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:26.200
So yes, it sucks. I mean, it's good that they're getting rid of those online mod menus because

01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:30.920
that's really where the problems are coming from. It sucks that they're targeting Open 4 because

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:37.160
that really is not part of this. Their thought is because draw in, and honestly it was one of

01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:42.040
the reasons I purchased Grand Theft Auto for the third time. Grand Theft Auto 5 for the third time

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:47.640
on my third console. No more giving me shit about Mass Effect 3. For the third time on PCB because

01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:52.520
it was for modding because I wanted to mod the game and that was one of the reasons. Now they

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:59.640
have basically stolen that from me, which is ridiculous. And I mean, I don't know, we'll find

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:04.600
a way around it, I'm sure, but it's still annoying that they would punish players like that because

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:11.080
I think what it comes down to, as this is the head of Take-Two said before, they see the player

01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:16.280
base as more wood to be chopped. Whereas basically those people that bought the game and are spending

01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:20.680
a lot of their time offline playing with mods, if you want all that creative stuff that you were

01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:28.040
able to do with modding, now you better go out to play online and buy those shark cards so that you

01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:32.280
can buy all this content. That's kind of what's keeping me offline a lot because of this whole

01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:39.800
pay-the-win stuff. I want to go to chat because there's a lot of comments from this here in chat.

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:43.720
Dungeonbuster in chat says, Steam rankings for Grand Theft Auto 5 are torn down by a lot of

01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:48.840
angry reviewers. From what I understand, the mod tool took a lot of pains to avoid the problems

01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:53.720
the Cease and Desist accused it of. Tigerclaw in chat says, I wonder how this will affect a Grand

01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:58.040
Theft Auto 5 community that does Grand Theft Auto 5 RPs. There's a community that role plays in

01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:01.240
Grand Theft Auto 5 using a mod so they can play as cops. Yeah, you're probably not gonna be able to

01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:05.000
do it anymore. That sucks. Yeah, it does suck because that was really benign stuff that they

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.400
had and it was just changing. They want to charge for it like Bethesda is. Well, here's what it was

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:13.240
is they were just playing with like different modifications that weren't necessarily affecting

01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:17.640
online. A lot of it was just like model swaps like you're taking their generic police car and

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:23.080
replacing with a real police car model. Who gives a shit? No, it's not affecting anybody else except

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:30.040
the player that's actually using the mod and so it's just sad that they, I think that they,

01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:34.920
they're gonna play dumb and pretend like, oh well, you know, I guess the excuse might be,

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:39.640
well someone hacked it and they modded it so that it works online. Okay, well that's not,

01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:47.720
you of all people, take two, should fucking know about how someone hacked something and

01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:53.240
it's not representative of the actual product. Hello cop, you know, hot coffee mod anyone?

01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:58.920
I mean shit, I mean you have that stuff disabled but someone hacked it and then they accessed it

01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:05.000
and so that's not representative of what the final product was. I mean come on, you understand what

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:10.600
it is and like they went out more than I think fair out of their way to try to prevent any sort

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:14.440
of this nonsense and then they're still getting punished for it and I think it's because of

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:20.120
fucking greed. It's because once again they want you to pay for those because Grand Theft Auto

01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:27.080
Online is making a ton of money and they feel and they even fucking boldly just, just, just

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:32.040
bragged about it. Just like we think that we can get more money that people aren't paying enough

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:36.040
on Grand Theft Auto Online. We want you, we're just gonna go get that wood shop.

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:36.760
Wow.

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:38.760
It's, it's fucking sick.

01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:44.200
All right, well I'm gonna move on for time's sake but wow, that's a pretty bold move. Let's talk

01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:47.640
about, let's, now finally I have some good news because I know everybody wants to go

01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:52.600
to Super Nintendo Land when it opens up at Universal Studios. Yay theme park news,

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:57.560
yay theme parks make it all better. Well apparently some information already hitting

01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:03.560
out on the internet. Some leaked information about the Orlando Park and what Super Nintendo

01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:10.040
Land is supposed to look like. Now keep in mind it could be fake but I don't know it looks.

01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:11.560
They have the trailer for the Japanese.

01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:14.360
Yeah, they have the trailer for the Japanese one so we, you know, there are some things out there

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:19.960
that are legit but anyway apparently a Mario Kart ride is happening. That is part of it which

01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:26.040
seems so obvious doesn't it? I just hope I can blue shell my friends. That's just what I hope

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:31.560
is a part of it. But anyway, also there might be Kirby areas and Zelda areas. There's a Kirby Kids

01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:38.280
Playland, a Donkey Kong Island, a Zelda Kingdom, and a Super Mario World ride which I assume is,

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:44.760
is part of the, where the Mario Kart thing is. For those familiar with Universal Studios Orlando,

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:48.920
I've never been there. I only know the one in Hollywood but it's right by the Simpsons ride

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:51.080
where they're building it. It's right on the other side of that.

01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:54.200
I mean it's all right but it sounds like the Kirby Land really sucks.

01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:59.480
I think that's a pun. Act Def, Act Def put it down. I think, I think, I think that was just a pun.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:06.520
So anyway, yeah, I, hey, I'm all for, I can't wait for this to come out. I want to, I want to go,

01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:11.880
I want to go there. I really do. Act Def in chat says, Kirby area, when are we going?

01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:17.080
Let's see, Dungeon Buster in chat says, if the Zelda Kingdom has a ride as awesome as

01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:23.800
Gringotts bank ride, I'm there. It looks like the Mario ride is the biggest one.

01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:27.400
I don't even think Zelda has a ride. It looks like more of the photo opportunities, but you never

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:31.880
know. We'll, we'll see. We'll see what they build there. Because if you think about it, they did do

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:36.200
that expansion in Orlando and they just opened in Hollywood. So I finally went there. The Harry

01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:43.160
Potter area expanded. And I got to say that ride is fucking magical. Like that, that, the Forbidden

01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:47.480
Journey or whatever that ride is called the one that's like, uh, it's like half roller coaster,

01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:51.960
half in front of screens and stuff. That ride is fucking magical. Like I, I really enjoyed that

01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:56.200
ride, but they have, so that's like the highlight. That's like the thing you have to fucking do if

01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:00.360
you go to Harry Potter world. Um, but then they also have like a little roller coaster that's,

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:04.840
Oh, okay. It's cute. And that's like it. So they opened this whole Harry Potter world to open up

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:11.000
shops, things that look like Harry Potter world to sell butter beer. So you can expect that there's

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.840
going to be a lot of that when Nintendo as well, a lot of it is going to be to sell you Nintendo

01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:19.560
merchandise. I'm sure plenty of you are going to be okay with that. The shroom market. There's

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:24.840
a fan. That's right. That's right. Who knows what, what food and drink, but they're not telling you

01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:29.800
though, unfortunately is that super Mario world or a super Nintendo land or whatever. It's actually

01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:35.400
based off of the super Mario brothers movie. And so it's all post-apocalyptic with like crappy

01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:40.600
fungus everywhere. And, and like tiny did universal put out that movie? I don't think

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:43.880
they did. I don't think universal was a studio behind that movie. I feel like it was new line

01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:50.280
or somebody else. It was probably new line. All right. Anyway, let's move on. Uh, dark soccer.

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:52.600
What do you have for us before we get to the classic game of the week soon?

01:35:53.160 --> 01:36:00.200
Well, um, they have confirmed a prequel for life is strange. They've, uh, confirmed a three part

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:08.680
prequel. Um, and it will be called, uh, before the storm. And it was actually confirmed by

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:15.640
Ashley Burch, who played Chloe, that she will not be, uh, uh, reprising her role

01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:28.920
because the sag afters after a strike. So, um, she, um, but she apparently was consulted about

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:37.000
the, the role anyway. So, um, it should be interesting. I hope that, you know, there is a

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:43.640
good voice actor, but still, I think it's really shady for them going around the guild. You know,

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:48.920
when this strike is there for improving the conditions of voice actors.

01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:53.560
I have heard there's some more progress, like just in this last week that there's progress being

01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:56.680
made at the strike that I guess they're going to sit down at the table again and hopefully

01:36:56.680 --> 01:37:01.640
fucking resolve this already. But yeah, I mean, now, I mean, we all said when the strike first

01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:05.960
started, you're not going to feel it now, but you're going to fit these games in production.

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:10.120
You're going to start to feel it later on. And so now, now we're starting to see it a little bit.

01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:18.600
So I just hope that perception of, Oh, nothing's changed. Hasn't like been the cause of this going

01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:23.400
on so long, but I think some independent, like some studios have kind of independently kind of

01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:26.760
like it's this whole strike is very strange because like, I think some studios have like

01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:31.400
independently met the needs. And so they're like, okay, but others aren't. And it's very,

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:37.320
it's very fragmented right now. But it's just so irritating that there are still studios out there

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:43.480
who are looking for voice actors who aren't yet in the guild. Cause it takes a lot to get

01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:50.600
into the screen actors guild. And the fact that they're looking for people who may be,

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:56.280
who may be willing to work in those conditions for a lesser amount of money, you know,

01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:02.200
it damages all the attempts being made by the screen, by the voice actors. It's really,

01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:06.520
and these companies that are doing it know full well that they're harming these people.

01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:14.760
So I hope this isn't the case. I hope it's just a contract issue, but I still, I still have little

01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:23.160
respect for anyone who's going to. I have, I'll say I don't have respect for the action

01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:27.960
of anything that would harm the goal of SAG-AFTRA.

01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:34.120
Sure. And we have, we have friends of the show. Y'all know miss Marissa is in that industry and,

01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:37.160
you know, has hopefully given a voice to that side of it here on the show.

01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:38.200
Yeah. We're going to have her back.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.440
We do. And Marissa is very talented.

01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:46.840
Yes, she is. Yes. Yes. Uh, anyway, I got to go to this follow-up comment and chat over

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:50.920
at live.vognetware.com to the Mario brothers and who made the movie. Tiger class says the

01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:55.400
super Mario brothers movie was made by Hollywood pictures and distributed by Buena Vista pictures,

01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:59.880
distribution, ink, Hollywood pictures. If I remember is owned by Disney. And I,

01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:04.520
I recall that as well. So no wonder they went to the other place in Orlando.

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:11.240
No wonder they were like Disney. Nah, I'm good. We'll go to, we'll go. We'll go to the other place.

01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:12.440
Thanks. See ya.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.560
All right. Loki, what do you have for us before we get to a classic end of the week coming up?

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:25.480
As I spoiled earlier in this show, uh, level five has acquired Comcept and they've created

01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:31.800
a subsidiary now called level five concept. Yes. It's a very unique, um, name. And of course,

01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:36.520
Comcept, you may remember is releasing a game called mighty number nine, and they have that

01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:41.000
red Ash something or other game that's coming out. That's, you know, the not mega man legends,

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.480
but mega man legends, but Hey, we're already starting an anime and the game, and we haven't

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:51.720
even put out the one game. And yeah. So, um, level five concept is also working on a game. Actually,

01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:55.720
their first title is going to be called dragging colonies, which is going to be an iOS and Android

01:39:55.720 --> 01:40:02.040
title. And that's soon coming out in Japan and 2018, it looks like, and they said it's going

01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:09.560
to feature dice shaped miniature garden colonies called a colonies and players can build them up.

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:13.640
And there's one-on-one honestly, it sounds like every single mobile game that's out there.

01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:18.760
I've seen a lot of mobile game advertisements having to play this free to play game.

01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:23.400
Sure. And they all fucking look the same. Like I'm, I know it's a terrible thing. Nothing

01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:28.920
looks quite like Garth. Nothing. Nothing looks quite like Garfield go Garfield go.

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:36.200
And I played like a brief minute of it. That is one janky piece of shit. Like I'm telling you,

01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:40.840
it's just like that. That was like, Hey, let's cash that shit in.

01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:46.120
All right. Well, uh, you know, one of the things that's come up a lot lately and even

01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:49.720
Loki references earlier in the show are the voice chat solutions over on the switch,

01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:54.040
by the way, somebody did poke Reggie on that. And I don't, I don't have the interview in front of me

01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:57.720
because it doesn't relate to what I'm about to talk about. But I do recall Reggie saying

01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:02.760
something similar to what I thought I had mentioned here on OLR, that what we saw that

01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:09.400
hoary thing, that, uh, thing with the Splatoon, that's just one possible solution. That is not,

01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:14.440
that's what one third party is doing. That's not the end all only way that's going to work.

01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:19.080
But Reggie does confirm it will be through an app, but there have been other people that have just

01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:23.960
kind of said, well, that's kind of what we're doing anyway. We're using Skype or we're using

01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:28.600
discord, uh, is one thing that's growing a lot with gamers. And, uh, what's interesting about

01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:32.680
this is that a fan actually asked discord on Twitter, cause that's what we do now these days

01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:39.160
is tweet people about an app on the Nintendo switch and discord said, we hope so. And they

01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:44.840
gave a link to a upvote the idea over at a particular link. So discord would love to be

01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:49.560
involved in the solution over on the Nintendo switch. I don't think it would work because you

01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:56.040
can't have two apps at the same time. Can you, um, but that's yet to be determined. I think with

01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:03.400
the switch, you can, well, you can have the shell of the system, the OS and changing the games and

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:08.840
all that still runs while you have a game running in the background. So the system is able to

01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:14.920
multitask. I think more than probably the Wii U was able to, but we don't, we don't know it's

01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:20.840
full potential yet. I think it's too early to say cause we haven't. Uh, it's a nice idea, but I just,

01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:26.680
I I'm skeptical now. Tiger class. Is there a discord app on Xbox one and PlayStation four?

01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:31.240
I don't believe so. So, uh, at least not that I'm aware of is there, if there is,

01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:36.200
I've never used it. Um, but it's more, I think of it more as a PC slash mobile phone thing is,

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:40.920
is where discord is a solution for a lot of things. They don't go with like Skype or something

01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:47.880
because you would think Skype is well, who owns Skype, Loki, Microsoft. Yeah. So, but no, there's

01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:52.280
a reason for that because they're talking like cross play for like other, um, games and stuff.

01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:57.400
I mean, you would think if you, if you use the Skype app, then you're, I have, let's honestly,

01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:01.000
people are going to find another solution. That's gonna be better than what Nintendo has anyway. So

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.480
why am I even thinking about this? By the way, speaking of discord, I can, uh, teach you with

01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:09.480
this a little bit, by the way, uh, Bobby and I were talking earlier this evening and there is

01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:13.560
going to be a VOG network discord in the very near future. Uh, something that we want to use

01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:18.360
as more and more of our, um, uh, personalities and shows are growing into the live broadcasting

01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:22.440
over on Twitch. Um, that not just includes myself, but Bobby and even more people that

01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:26.680
are getting involved with that, um, as well as having a place, uh, for example,

01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:31.560
a chat room that's kind of always on, except, uh, like not only on Sunday nights, by the way,

01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:35.880
IRC is not going anywhere, at least not right. And it's not, not anything we're talking about

01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:39.160
right now. The IRC is still gonna work the same way it always does for the Sunday night shows.

01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:43.880
I'm not saying that, but a nice way, for example, maybe if we had a channel on OLR

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:47.000
and throughout the week, you might find a story that's like, Hey, I wish you guys would talk

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.520
about this on the show. We're going to have a place where to kind of collect that information.

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:55.160
So that's going to be really exciting. So, uh, I see, I see discord myself as more of like the

01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:59.880
modern version of the forums because our VOG network forums kind of have tumbleweed rolling

01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:06.120
through them. Um, so I think discord is going to be a great, uh, uh, I don't want to say replacement,

01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:10.120
I think a great evolution, let's say of that. So please look forward to it.

01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:14.040
I was hoping we might be able to unveil that tonight, but I've, and it's my fault. I've been

01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:18.440
so busy that Bobby and I have been able to coordinate notes on that. So look forward to it

01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:24.360
soon. Uh, period. Uh, Bobby Blackwolf says technically the IRC is always on all week.

01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:28.440
Rob just never shows up outside of Sundays. Yeah, I guess it's, it's part of my, partially my fault,

01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:32.520
but at the same time, um, you know, I think discord is kind of built a little more because

01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:36.520
it's on your mobile phone to be somewhere that goes with you. Whereas IRC isn't as,

01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:40.440
I mean, yes, I know there's IRC clients on the phone, but we all know it's not as easy,

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:47.160
so it'll be nice. So stay tuned for that. Meanwhile, we're going to take a trip

01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:50.360
down memory lane with the classic game of the week.

01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:56.840
Every week, dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:03.320
Hey, you ungrateful kids, get off my lawn and go play this video game. Now dark soccer,

01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:09.160
it is an anniversary show tonight. It is the 15th birthday of OLR tonight. So I expect nothing

01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:13.320
less than an epic choice for tonight's classic game of the week. Are you, are you going to

01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:18.040
deliver? It's relatively epic. I think so. I think she picked a good one this week. I think this is

01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:21.320
a very appropriate choice. After much deliberation. And also you have to consider there's a lot of

01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:25.080
things she's picked in the past that she didn't want to repeat. Yeah. But this is good. This is

01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:28.760
a good choice. So dark soccer here on the 15th anniversary of OLR, what'd you pick for the

01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:35.800
classic game of the week? Pump it up. Yay. Which is not what I originally picked, but after some

01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:40.360
discussion, it turned out to be the right choice. That's right. For the record, it's never going

01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:52.760
to be Halo. No Xbox Halo game is going to be classic game. Stop asking. No Xbox Halo game.

01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:56.520
Honestly, 15 years ago, I would have never thought this would be a classic game of the

01:45:56.520 --> 01:46:02.920
week, to be honest. So we're making progress. Plus Darian's fucking great. Anyway, pump it up.

01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:11.480
It's a music game that was developed by Nextcade and published by Andamiro in Korea. And it is a

01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:17.560
dance game and it's sort of like, I like to think of it as the flip side of DDR and as far as

01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:25.640
dancing games goes, because it uses the squares that DDR doesn't. It's got five panels. And I

01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:29.880
mean, it's got doubles play, but you basically have up left, up right, bottom left, bottom right

01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:36.920
and the center panel. So it really is the flip side of DDR that way. And basically, like DDR,

01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:45.160
the arrows are synchronized to a rhythm or beat of a chosen song. And you have to step on the

01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:55.720
arrows the right way. It first came out in South Korea in August of 1999 and has been released in

01:46:55.720 --> 01:47:01.400
other countries, including all over North America, South America, Europe, you know, I should say

01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:08.920
continents then. But as far as other versions are concerned, the thing that I thought was kind of

01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:14.200
neat about it is that it does have the, you know, the I'm falling on my ass help me bar,

01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:21.160
which is kind of like in the shape of an R on one side and the reverse R the other way,

01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:24.360
you know, I guess to hold over DDR. But man, that thing hurts when you fall on it.

01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:35.640
So basically, each of the panels is made of acrylic glass and it's arranged like I described

01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:40.520
earlier. And so each of these pads is switch activated. When the screen, you know,

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:46.040
shows you which one to step on, you step on it while hopefully not looking like you're flailing

01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:52.200
for your life. Later on, we had the DX version that came out. Those use rear projection televisions

01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:59.160
for the monitors. And they're definitely a lot cleaner looking. And they also have USB ports

01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:09.240
after NX2. So you can save your statistics and, you know, and it does have a proprietary USB drive.

01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:18.200
So moving on, there did have home versions that were released. There was the PC version that came

01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:23.320
with the version of the dance mat. The arrows are exactly the same size as the arcade, you know,

01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:31.640
and it connected to the PS2 port and had an adapter so that you could share that with your

01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:38.680
keyboard. On the international versions, there is a USB plug. Also XSEDE and Xero were released for

01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:51.160
PSP. In 2004, Andamira released the Korean version of Pump It Up XSEDE for PS2. And it had most of

01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:57.080
the songs from the arcade XSEDE version. The US version came out in 2005 for Xbox and PlayStation

01:48:57.080 --> 01:49:03.960
2. Under the name Pump It Up XSEDE and it had most of the songs from the Korean PS2 version and six

01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:13.320
licensed songs. So there also are, of course, the emulated versions, or I should say simulated

01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:20.520
versions like Kick It Up, Direct Move, and StepMania. But overall Pump It Up has been

01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:29.080
really well received. The thing is is that you've got your DDR loyalists and then for a while I was

01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:33.960
kind of, now the term didn't exist as we know it today, but I think, you know, a few years ago I

01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:39.400
would have called some of our Pump It Up players as kind of dancing game hipsters. Everyone plays

01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:46.280
DDR. I'm playing Pump It Up, you know, but at the same time it was really fun. It had a lot of

01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:51.800
great music and I thought that having the full video playing in the background like it was for

01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:56.920
a lot of the songs was kind of novel at the time given that we just had the repeating videos like

01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:02.840
with DDR with the little dancing people over it. In some cases there were even a lot of songs that

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:07.080
I thought were a lot better than some of the versions of Pump It Up and it gave us some real

01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:13.080
classics that, you know, that even today we can't, you know, think of the game without thinking of

01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:21.560
those songs, you know. Like, I mean, yeah, we had Starion in DDR. It was a crossover, yeah. But we

01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:26.120
had it in Pump It Up. We had Rent You. We had Funky Tonight which was just playing in the background

01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:30.120
there. This is Shane's favorite song that we're transitioning into here, Lazenka. Yeah. You know,

01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:35.080
you can't help but think of that one too, yeah. Just lots of great music and I would even say

01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:43.080
in my opinion that the difficulty of Pump It Up might even be a little bit harder with DDR,

01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:48.920
especially I'd say more if you're a DDR player going to Pump It Up and having a lot of experience

01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:57.720
with it. You know, you kind of have to retrain your feet for it. And so overall, I mean, I think

01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:06.280
that the game has really stood up. It's emerged as its own, in its own right as opposed to,

01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:10.520
you know, DDR is the first thing that people think of. But I'd say it's like the Pepsi to

01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:16.040
DDR's Coke, you know. And a lot of people think that Pepsi is better. I mean, I think Pepsi is

01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:22.280
better but I'd like DDR better as a game but still, still, still, still. Don't you have 7 Up?

01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:30.280
Girl, 7 Up is made by PepsiCo. They're a Pepsi product. Josta was a Pepsi product. Dr. Pepper.

01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:35.320
Okay. Yeah, they're like that. What was that other game that I was trying to think of the name of?

01:51:35.320 --> 01:51:39.800
Yeah, JD, I thought so. 7 Up is part of Dr. Pepper's Snapple.

01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:45.880
Okay, whatever. So anyway, we've got all kinds of versions that were released but, you know,

01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:53.880
as far as the other, the other games, I mean, the music in the games, you know, how a lot of the

01:51:53.880 --> 01:52:01.880
DDR games went from the, great. Now, the fuck, what were the CDs?

01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:05.400
VCDs or? Dance Mania CDs.

01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:07.880
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Dance Maniacs.

01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:11.800
Yeah, well, it went though from a lot of, I'm trying to think of the company.

01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:13.480
Oh, Toshiba EMI.

01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:21.080
Yeah, Toshiba EMI. But, you know, Konami also had their own in-house as well. And for Pump It

01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:26.040
Up, they had Banya, which was their in-house artist group.

01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:29.320
What good timing. We're in a Banya song right now. Love is a Danger Zone.

01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:38.520
Another good time. But they got a lot of good K-pop licenses. And they even though would go

01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:45.960
kind of like how, again, DDR was doing too. There were covers of classical music done in

01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:51.960
symphonic rock style, like for example, Canon and D. Okay, I hate Canon. I hate playing it. Okay,

01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:57.000
that's my tangent on that one for me. But they'd have some jazz and folk and ska in there. It was

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:08.920
pretty cool. The only thing is that they were not so keen on some of the electronic music.

01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:16.680
But the first time it came up would be in NX2, usually with covers of American music. So

01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:21.160
there you go. It all started with the first dance floor.

01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:31.640
All right, there it is the classic game of the week. Pump It Up, aka that other dance game.

01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:35.960
Man, I'm still trying to remember what the one that had the six.

01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:41.400
So I was just say this day and age is kind of, I mean, fast forward to 15 years later,

01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:44.840
I mean, we say that tongue in cheek that other dance game. But now it's like, especially when

01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:49.720
you go to a place like round one, it's right. It's side by side with DDR. And you've got people

01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:52.840
that are playing both. That's the one I was trying to think of was Easy to Dancer.

01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:58.280
Easy to Dancer. Oh my God. That's right. They had one in that bowling alley in Oakland.

01:53:58.280 --> 01:54:05.160
There's your Snapple. That's not even the Snapple. That's like Shasta.

01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:11.560
That's the Dr. Thunder. It's the Walmart brand. Easy to Dancer was okay,

01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:17.800
but my God, it was kind of boring. All right. 3DDX was like the RC Cola.

01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:22.200
Oh God. All right. We got to take a break. When we come back, guys, plenty more of

01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:25.720
Orange Lounge Radio. We got some emails tonight. We're going to get into release dates as well.

01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:28.840
And your calls. We actually don't have as many stories in part B, which probably good

01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:32.440
because this first part is run long. We're almost at two hours, just the first half of the show.

01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:36.360
Yeah. We got allowed. We're old. Yeah, I know. We got plenty more show to come.

01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:39.720
Your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype after a quick break. Don't go anywhere. We

01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:46.120
will be right back on this very special OLR. To register participation for this week's

01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:50.360
episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, lock.

01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:21.240
All of our love and support go out to you tonight on this special day. Rob, Jamie and Loki.

01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:26.520
Oh my God. It's almost your sweet 16 hearts. There better be a party for that y'all. Anyway,

01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:30.120
have a great show. Congrats again and see you space cowboy.

01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:35.960
Thank you very much to our pals over at gameboy.org. We didn't even ask for those

01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:41.160
because some of you might've been like, OLR was taking the bumpers. Actually, we didn't solicit

01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:45.000
that. That just showed up in Dropbox. So I thought that was a nice little surprise from

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.200
our pals over at gameboy.org. So thank you very much for that. I appreciate that. And I love what

01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:54.200
they do over there so much that I do a show on the side with those two. It was a lot of fun.

01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:57.240
So anyway, um, also I want to make sure this doesn't get lost in the shuffle. I do want to

01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:01.480
get back into gaming news, but we've had so much going on tonight with, with E3 and the 15th

01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:05.880
birthday and all that other stuff. I want to make sure this doesn't get lost. Happy father's day

01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:11.560
to all the gamer dads and dad-like figures and et cetera and so forth out there, uh, including

01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:16.680
our very own, of course, Loki is, uh, celebrating father's day today. Did the kids leave you alone

01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:24.520
today so you could play video games? Well, that's a rip off. Sorry to hear that. That's right. They,

01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:29.800
we went to dinner last night and then they're so whiny yesterday, but ah, what are you gonna do?

01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:34.600
All right. Uh, well anyway, so, so yes. And of course, cat dads, dog dads, all that. I hope

01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:38.280
everybody, whoever, however you're celebrating today, you're enjoying your father's day today.

01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:43.400
And moms who are dads to their kids. Why not? Why not? Why not? Single moms or whatever the

01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:48.920
situation is. All the single mamas put your hands up. All right. Uh, we're going to get back into

01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:54.680
some video game news though. Let's go to some rapid fire news. Loki. So there's this, um,

01:56:54.680 --> 01:57:02.680
cool video I saw online for this. They have a VR center now that's in Namco Bandai's VR zone in

01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:08.840
Shinjuku. And they have a lot of cool games. They're one of which is actually a VR super

01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:14.440
Mario Kart experience. So you actually sit in these little, it looks like go-karts. You have

01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:19.320
a vibe on and they even have like sensors on their hands so that you could throw shells and

01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:26.040
everything. It looks pretty bad-ass. Um, aside from that, let's just say that Mario isn't your

01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:33.080
thing. Then, um, they would also have a neon Genesis game. They actually go and, um, fight,

01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:37.320
you know, some of the angels in that. And then they even have a Dragon Ball Z experience as

01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:41.400
well. So you can like throw fireballs and stuff. Hmm. It looks pretty, pretty awesome from the

01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:45.800
video. So I want to check that out, but that made me think, you know, when we're talking about the

01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:50.200
whole Super Nintendo land and like a Mario Kart experience, I was like, I could see something very

01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:54.680
similar to that being like the Mario Kart experience. So it's not like a new ride they

01:57:54.680 --> 01:58:00.040
have over at, um, Six Flags Marine World or whatever they're calling it now over in Vallejo.

01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:03.720
They have the whole, uh, like there's some roller coaster, but it runs on VR or something.

01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:07.880
Like it's like part roller coaster, but you have big headsets on. Oh,

01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:13.160
that they, I know they have like some of these roller coasters that they can kind of like remix

01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:18.280
the experience basically. So they have a, it's, um, at least the ones I've seen in the past have

01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:24.040
been a gear VR and you wear them on your, your face and it's synced, the movements are synced

01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:29.320
to the actual ride. So you're feeling all the G forces and stuff from the roller coaster,

01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:32.520
but you're like flying through space or like at the city or something like that.

01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:37.480
Does that mean that's cool? I still don't like roller coasters enough to try that,

01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:41.800
but it looks cool. Sounds cool. By the way, a quick follow up before you get to your other thing,

01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:46.600
quick follow up on the happy father's day thing. Uh, JD reminds me of this. There was a

01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:52.120
game announced on steam today called dream daddy, a dad dating simulator that's making

01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:55.880
its rounds on the internet. So it reminded me to, uh, wish a happy father's day to all

01:58:55.880 --> 01:59:01.080
those daddies out there as well. Wink nudge. Sorry, Loki back to you.

01:59:01.640 --> 01:59:09.720
So wasting no time whatsoever. There was a mod for super Mario 64 called super Mario

01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:18.680
Odyssey 64 that allows you to have the, um, hat power up to take control of different creatures,

01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:23.720
including like they have a bomb, um, all the different things. So you can even use that on,

01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:30.520
um, was it on the castle grounds? You can take control of birds and other stuff,

01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:37.480
collect and throw coins. Um, so very cool. So yeah, that was released by cause a, uh,

01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:45.160
um, a monitor and yeah, I mean, that's just crazy that it only took him like a week to do that.

01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:50.920
So if you're interested in checking it out, um, they had a link on Kotaku for it. So good.

01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:57.160
Or go Nintendo has a link too. So, all right. All right. Well, moving on, uh, this is, uh,

01:59:57.160 --> 02:00:02.040
another rerelease of this game. That's come out a few times in different platforms. It's 2064

02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:06.440
read only memories, uh, which came from mid boss, which we had Matt from mid boss on the show.

02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:11.320
They're also the folks that put on gamer X, which that did get funded gamer X East. So our pals on

02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:15.160
the East coast will get to go to that for a second time this year. Um, but mid boss also

02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:19.720
behind this game, 2064 read only memories. And it was announced this week that it will be coming out

02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:25.000
to the Nintendo switch and there will be some new extras, including some switch exclusive features,

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:30.840
new voice scenes, fast skip auto save and, uh, other core gaming improvements. And it's running

02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:38.040
on a new framework for unity. So they're calling it 2064 read only memories in integral. So good

02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:42.840
luck with that release. That's early 18, 2018. We don't know specifically when yet.

02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:50.040
And, uh, another piece I have here, this comes from, um, uh, actually the, uh, Southern fried

02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:55.240
game room expo, which a VOG network was sponsoring during this last weekend. I know Bobby was talking

02:00:55.240 --> 02:01:00.120
a lot about it on his show, but I hope some of y'all, some of y'all were able to go visit that,

02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:07.640
uh, there was a, um, cabinet there, a restored sky skipper cabinet. And this was something where,

02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:13.800
um, Nintendo was going to put this out, I guess, but then they didn't, uh, it was dropped in 1982.

02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:19.160
Uh, but, uh, even though some ROMs found their way online, uh, and I guess there was an Atari

02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:22.520
2,600 version of this, although I don't remember it at all, but I guess that was something there

02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:27.640
was no cabinets, uh, that were really known to exist. So they actually were able to get one of

02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:32.600
the cabinets from the vaults of Nintendo America. So that's something right there that Nintendo kind

02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:37.000
of agreed to let this happen. So that's pretty cool. Uh, and then, uh, yeah, there was a prototype

02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:41.800
cabinet that was actually built and on display there as Southern fried, uh, Southern fried game

02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:48.760
room expo. And there's a whole little walkthrough and all this stuff over at YouTube, John's arcade,

02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:53.960
which I know dark soccer has mentioned on the show before. And w speaking of ties from a long time

02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:58.280
ago, John being one of the hosts on video game outsiders, which was at all games radio at the

02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:03.160
same time we were so kind of funny how that all plays out. Now he has a massively successful

02:02:03.160 --> 02:02:10.200
YouTube channel and we're, well, we're turning 15. I'm just teasing. No, that's great. Uh, so

02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:13.960
yeah, I would like to play this game someday. Perhaps that machine will tour the country.

02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:18.760
We'll see. Uh, anyhow, uh, let's move on dark soccer. A few things from you.

02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:28.040
Oh, just some stuff basically. Um, first of all, going on about the Atari 2,600,

02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:34.280
there is a revival console that, uh, is, uh, going to be, I mean, first of all,

02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:40.920
there's a bajillion ways that you can play, um, Atari 2,600 games regardless, but now, um,

02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:52.840
there is, uh, the retron 77 that is, uh, basically a remade Atari 2,600. You can use original

02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:59.960
joysticks, but you can use USB controllers. And, um, they, the theory is going that it would be

02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:07.880
retail about 80 bucks. So we'll see, of course, uh, being released by, uh, Hyperkin. And then the

02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:19.240
second thing not so happy is that, um, Keith Robinson, uh, who is the guy behind the Intellivision,

02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:26.360
he died on Wednesday this past week, 61 years old, not bad, not great, but, um,

02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:32.040
you know, he, uh, designed games for, uh, the Intellivision that was put up by Mattel.

02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:37.560
And then he bought the rights to a television and, uh, kept up with Intellivision lives

02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:43.720
collections. So thank you to him and rest in peace. Yeah. You know, actually I'm speaking

02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:47.240
of E3 memories. I don't know if you guys remember this, but that whole year, you know, and I

02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:50.360
referenced this earlier in the show that whole year that all the all game stuff was there at

02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:54.760
the arena. He was there being interviewed by Scott over at all games and all of them, he was,

02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:59.080
he was there at that arena. What did they call the arena lounge or whatever it was during the

02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:02.520
during E3, that one year. So I remember meeting the guy and, you know, listening to some of his

02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:07.560
stories. So it's, um, you know, it's, it's definitely a loss and a harsh reminder that

02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:12.600
some of these great minds in gaming that brought us these games in the seventies and eighties,

02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:17.240
you know, they're getting up there in age is as horrible as it may sound to say, you know,

02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:22.520
we gotta, we gotta get as many interviews, as many recordings, as many stories, as much as we

02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:26.920
can about those times before it's too late. So, Oh, one thing I wanted to mention, I forgot to

02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:31.480
mention during my VR story. Yeah. One of the other games that they noticed that they had on there

02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:37.000
was a VR prop cycle game. Oh yeah. Everybody like, you know, doing the whole like, you know,

02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:39.880
stationary bike thing. So I thought that was kind of cool.

02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:45.000
Huh? All right. Well, let's travel around and look at what's coming out in stores

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.480
this week. What will be on shelves this week, Loki?

02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:55.240
So this week we've got God Wars Future Pass on PlayStation 4 and Vita. Um, we have Next Machina

02:04:55.240 --> 02:05:05.000
on PC and PlayStation 4, and then on 3DS Ever Oasis, um, Get Even on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:13.480
One. And finally Secret Worlds Legends on PC. All right. Traveling over to Japan, uh, on the

02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:18.760
PlayStation 4 this week in Japan, LocoRoco gets its release. Uh, I remember they were remastering

02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:23.480
some old favorites from like PSP and stuff, uh, or, you know, like Prapa was one of these. Now

02:05:23.480 --> 02:05:28.120
LocoRoco is coming as well. That'll be out on PlayStation 4 on June the 22nd, as well as Far

02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:35.160
Point gets its Japanese release this week. Uh, over on the Vita, Tokyo Yamanote Boys 4 V

02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:40.520
main disc in regular and limited edition, as well as a game called God Wars, uh, which I believe is

02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:47.160
Future Pass, but they call it, uh, in Japan, Toki wo Koete comes out this week. And lastly,

02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:51.400
I want to see if anything's on the Switch this week. They are getting some of the Zelda figures

02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:56.120
this week in Japan, the Skyward Sword, Twilight Princess, and Majora's Mask. But otherwise amiibos

02:05:56.120 --> 02:06:01.240
are really the only thing to look forward to on the Switch. Uh, the 3DS doesn't really have

02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:05.560
anything except a game called the Alliance Alive that I must admit I don't know much about, but

02:06:05.560 --> 02:06:11.720
that is what is out in Japan this week. How about the UK DarkSakura? Uh, some stuff, really not a

02:06:11.720 --> 02:06:20.120
terrible lot. On the 19th is, uh, Dungeon Defenders 2 for Xbox One, the 21st Argo for PC, and the 22nd

02:06:20.120 --> 02:06:29.480
RPG Maker Fests. That's it. All right. I think it's time that we dive into the mailbag. Every

02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:36.280
week you guys email us over at participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we, uh, reads our emails

02:06:36.280 --> 02:06:40.040
as DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and pulls out emails. And sorry, there's, I don't know where my

02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:45.240
music is tonight. How'd it get all sticky? Where'd my music go for this segment? It's gone. You know

02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:52.760
what? I guess I'll just have to find the mailbag music. That's it. After the 15th anniversary,

02:06:52.760 --> 02:06:56.600
we're doing the fuck you music now. No, I'm just kidding. We would never, not with our listeners,

02:06:56.600 --> 02:07:00.680
not with our listeners. All right. But no, seriously, I think you guys did send us quite

02:07:00.680 --> 02:07:05.960
a few emails tonight, right? Yeah, a few. Yeah. So I will start at the start.

02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:12.760
Hello, LR. Congratulations on surviving and thriving through 15 years of the show where

02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:17.640
every gamer has a voice on this momentous occasion where we look back and realize just

02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:22.440
how long 15 years actually is. I can share something with you that happened to me

02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:27.720
recently and remind me that yes, we were all getting older. I live about 10 minutes away

02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:35.640
from a place called Sport Time USA. This place has existed since the 1990s and, uh, at least,

02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:41.320
and somehow it still exists today, probably due to a combination of high prices, a lack of competition

02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:47.160
and regular visits from schools, camps, and groups of religious and disabled. Inside,

02:07:47.160 --> 02:07:51.960
it looks dingy, dirty, half the games are broken or close enough, and most of them aren't worth

02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:57.480
playing anyway, but they have in the group, too, and it 100% works, and that's the only reason I go

02:07:57.480 --> 02:08:02.760
there once or twice a week, every week. Last night, I ran into an 11-year-old kid who looked

02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:08.760
at my onscreen USB name and recognized me both from my several high scores on the machine and

02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:12.920
also my status as a somewhat well-known member of the East Coast Music Gaming community.

02:08:12.920 --> 02:08:17.240
He is a huge fan of StepMania and in the group already, and although he's got a lot of work to do

02:08:17.880 --> 02:08:28.280
to, uh, G-I-T-G-U-D, he, uh, get good, okay, I don't know what that is, so it's kind of a meme,

02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:34.440
get good, okay, whatever, um, he was already, um, very familiar with the game, the community,

02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:37.160
and the work they've done on and around the game. For the record,

02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:43.880
slang can go over my head if I don't use it every day, so whatever. Of course, he has about a million

02:08:43.880 --> 02:08:49.640
questions for me. I honestly can't remember most of them because they were asked over eight minutes

02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:55.000
ago, and I'm a goldfish, but I'll never forget this one. He asked me which game I played first,

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:58.840
DDR or in the groove, because eyes went wide as I told him I started playing DDR that there was no

02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:03.560
such thing as in the groove yet. Then my own eyes went wide as I realized what was about to happen,

02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:08.040
but it was already too late. I could only listen in horror, and I distinctly heard these words

02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:14.200
escape my list lips. I've been playing this game since before you were born. This is the very first

02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:21.160
time that during a moment in which I was standing on a dance game machine platform, I really, truly,

02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:26.120
and finally started to feel old. Oh, well, so, um, yeah, happy 15 years and we're old.

02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:32.840
Loving Kisses, Y Y R. Y Y R, I heart you. I respect you. I wish you much,

02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:36.680
much success in your game development. Now fuck right off with that email.

02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:45.960
Since before you were born. Oh my God. I feel so old.

02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:54.760
Back in my day, in the groove, we played DDR on a low res monitor and there was no free

02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:59.000
there was either. And all the arrows were the same color. Back in my day,

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:06.440
we used a jungle book dance pad to play imported DDR games. Probably most people that I know of

02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:13.400
started DDR. Well, no, cause we did get that first mix that didn't have the vivid arrows

02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:19.480
and you played stomped my beat and you liked it. Some of us played while hitting each other with

02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:28.040
bats, Rob. Now, now think about this. Think about this, Ms. Summers. That was before this

02:10:28.040 --> 02:10:34.920
kid was born. Yeah. Damn new fuck right off of that email. No, but that, but that had to have

02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:41.720
been a experience for the stomp to my beat freestyle involved a person I don't associate

02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:48.120
with anymore and her ex. I know, I know. Crazy. It's crazy how things are involved with. And then

02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:54.440
I besides better stomped my beat the fucking sandstorm. Sandstorm didn't exist at the time.

02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:59.480
I even look in just in general, I even look into some of these people I see coming into like the

02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:04.920
arcades I go to now and I'm looking at them going like you were five when I started OLR probably.

02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:14.120
It's just, I, yeah. Now get off my lawn next email. Hey you guys, thank you so very much for

02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:20.680
blessing our ear holes with your insight, wit, humor, and fucks, Lukey. Happy to anytime.

02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:25.960
I've listened to every single show since the Katamari debacle that you put on my gaydar.

02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:34.600
Ever since a slow, even during slow news weeks, the show always entertains and gives me something

02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:40.200
new to look forward to come Monday morning. It takes a lot more than dedication and persistence,

02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:45.960
I'm going to add and boredom to do this almost every week of every year.

02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:54.520
And alcohol. I'm motivated by spite and porn. It took a lot of porn to get through these 15 years.

02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:58.440
In fact, I just, there was, there was a fucking episode of OLR early on. I was in the first

02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:04.360
hundred episodes. I wasn't here. I was the missing one. And Jamie and Loki did a show.

02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:08.600
And all I heard about that show was, yeah, we just, we watched a porn live on air.

02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:13.400
And I was like, the fuck happens when I'm not there.

02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:18.840
Was that the one where Marin Marvel was here? No, that was, that was another,

02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:21.560
that was a different episode. You guys have done the show without me,

02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:24.920
even though I don't remember right now at my house. I think it was a Jamie. So I think it

02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:28.760
was that long period. We did the show at my house. It was that place with the upstairs,

02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:36.040
downstairs, you had the townhouse. Yes. Yes, it was. Anyway. Um, where I hosted my first

02:12:36.040 --> 02:12:40.360
Bemani party there. We used to do Bemani parties regularly. That would usually just fall apart

02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:46.680
when people would start drinking. Um, okay. So back to this, um, it takes a deep and unwavering

02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:51.960
friendship. You guys genuinely love each other and that comes through crystal clear over the airwaves.

02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:56.040
I love Dark Sakura's wealth of knowledge on classic games and consoles and political views.

02:12:56.040 --> 02:13:01.080
Well, finally someone appreciates my political views. Loki's unwavering, brutal honesty and

02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:07.000
hatred of shitty gaming news. Rob's unapologetic and steely support of Nintendo and professionalism,

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:12.360
sometimes LOL. Well, I get mad at Nintendo sometimes too, but we remember it comes,

02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:16.840
it comes from a Tyra Banks place. We were rooting for you! Yeah, Valentina.

02:13:20.200 --> 02:13:23.720
Valentina is going to become my scapegoat for everything now, you know. I'm just trying to

02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:29.720
be to the community what Selena was. Dark Sakura. Girl, you do not go there. I know you do not,

02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:36.920
you do not invoke the name of the Lord and savior. The Latina goddess. Yes. Anyway,

02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:41.240
I always stay in the loop when it comes to games and new developments, but I don't have many

02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:47.160
friends that are as caught up and able to form opinions regarding the news of the week. It is

02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:52.840
always fun to listen to your opinions and colorful dialogue. I have been a PlayStation loyalist. I'm

02:13:52.840 --> 02:14:00.120
Rissimo on PSN by the way. I recognize that name. Games like Tomb Raider and Horizon Zero Dawn

02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:04.840
may seem daunting initially, but there are adjustable difficulty settings.

02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:10.360
And when you have, uh, when you get in the groove, the game flows like fucking butter.

02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:16.280
Bad imagery. Tomb Raider is fucking great. I have a story about an X and butter, so I'm going to

02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:24.440
leave it at that. Uh, I was like, uh, you had my attention. You have my attention, but I'm not

02:14:24.440 --> 02:14:29.400
after, after this 15 year, which I would call like sibling ship. We probably have here. I'm not sure

02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:33.320
I want to know any more about this story. Actually, this might be the OLR after dark.

02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:39.800
I see. That's why I was just going to leave it there. So those two words together, just like

02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:47.640
bad memory. Um, I know you all have PS4s and haven't played this masterpiece. I've gotten

02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:54.120
my, I've gotten my eight platinum via this game. I will, what'd the chat room say? Act

02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:59.560
deaf to chat says, I can't believe it's not my X and butter. I totally butchered that quote too.

02:14:59.560 --> 02:15:06.520
You had my curiosity, but now you have my attention. Anyway, I will buy it and ship it

02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:12.920
to you as a birthday gift, but only if you pledge to finish it. Let's finish a game. That's great.

02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:16.360
Let's finish a game. You know what though? That horizon zero dawn was on like a super

02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:21.000
sale recently. It was down to like, I seriously, I think until now, because I looked today,

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:25.320
I wanted the full, I checked the steam sale countdown page. And since they're doing the

02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:33.880
steam sale in three days, Oh fuck. I'm getting zen inverse. So anyway, but I do, I do want to

02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:44.600
play it though. On this tangents on my OLR. I also bought PSVR a month ago and I'm totally

02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:49.960
enamored with it. I got a sweet traveling case and I'm always packing it up and taking it over

02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:57.480
to friends houses. Buy it in caps. I know you felt burned by buying the PS4 pro Rob, but you don't

02:15:57.480 --> 02:16:02.680
have a 4k TV yet. So there's negligible differences with the few games you play on the system.

02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:07.800
I really just want to thank you guys and congratulate you all on a job. Well done.

02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:13.000
Fucking well. Thank you. Um, love the show and love you all Rissimo. Oh,

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:17.640
that was a very sweet email. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I'm thinking about it with PlayStation VR,

02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:23.480
but 4k gaming is going to be my next big investment. Probably loan your mind if you

02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:27.640
want it. Here we go. Here we go. Share and share alike. Why not? And then I could buy a copy of

02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:32.920
horizon and we can, we can trade around. Doesn't that sound like fun? I still have injustice to

02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:39.720
play. There you go. And the game and get on that. The game that, um, the nonary games that Shane,

02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:43.800
Oh yeah. Which you're probably never going to hear from me again, but I'm,

02:16:43.800 --> 02:16:47.480
but when that sale goes on, if dragon balls universe two goes cheap, I'm buying it.

02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:55.960
All right. More emails. Yes. Yeah. Yes. I just have to get to it. All right. We have

02:16:55.960 --> 02:17:00.120
three more to go. Oh my God. All right. Well, big show tonight. That's why we cut stories tonight.

02:17:01.800 --> 02:17:08.120
Hello. My congratulations on your 15 years of podcast existence. Thank you. Excuse me. I think

02:17:08.120 --> 02:17:13.800
I started listening to your show in late 2015 before that I wasn't really aware podcasts at

02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:18.680
all. Unfortunately I didn't discover all of this earlier, but since I, but since then I have

02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:22.920
enjoyed listening to your show. It is not always easy to keep track of all the gaming news during

02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:28.280
the week. So I appreciate that you take the time to do the show every Sunday. The fact that you're

02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:33.720
an open and welcome welcoming podcast is an important bonus too. About me, my gaming life

02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:41.880
go boosted when I bought a Wii U and Bayonetta 2 back in 2014. I still play Bayonetta 2

02:17:41.880 --> 02:17:48.200
regularly tag, uh, tag climax anyone, despite all the other new games. The Wii U game pad also got

02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:53.400
me back into drawing and I posted lots of things on Miiverse. However, with the switch, I feel like

02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:59.480
Miiverse is slowly disintegrating. Since I do reside in Germany, I cannot listen to your show

02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:04.440
live. It is basically in the middle of the night. So rely on the podcast every Monday morning.

02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:08.280
You could stay up late on a three day weekend if you really loved us. No, I'm totally can. I'm

02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:14.680
totally occasionally, very occasionally we will do like, uh, on earlier. Yeah. Maybe it's time we do

02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:20.120
another noon for us show, which would be like eight o'clock out there. Maybe, well, we're gonna,

02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:26.040
we're gonna really think about that. It's about time we do another Euro time show. Okay. Sorry,

02:18:26.040 --> 02:18:30.680
go ahead. That's okay. Um, I, uh, of course I also listen to other podcasts and I admit that it

02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:35.800
sometimes can be difficult to keep up with all of them, but yours currently has the highest priority.

02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:41.640
Smile on your Jubilee. I would like to know the following in your opinion, what has changed in

02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:47.080
podcasting during the last 15 years? I'll do a question by question. What has changed in

02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:53.320
podcasting in the last 15 years? Audio quality. Well, there was no podcasting when this show

02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:59.160
started. And that's part of the reason why we see it. You get in a lot of technicalities.

02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:08.440
Are we the longest running podcast for gaming? I think so, but I don't know. But because, well,

02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:13.080
here's the thing is that the podcasting is the technology wasn't really around until 2005, 2006.

02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:18.040
So we got on that pre iTunes, which there were very few shows that were on iTunes at the same

02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:23.720
time. I think the only one that is still putting out new shows is video game news radio, but even

02:19:23.720 --> 02:19:27.640
they're like once a year, I don't think they're regular at this point anymore. I apologize.

02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:32.920
I've lost sight. I've lost sight of, well, so do we, I've lost sight of a lot of these shows

02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:36.440
and can't listen to everything regularly, but I think, you know, they're still around, but I think

02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:40.120
they kind of changed and, you know, I don't, I don't think there's regular, but anyway,

02:19:40.120 --> 02:19:43.000
I don't want to sound shady cause I'm totally not like it's, it's impressive that they're

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.400
even still putting out what they do. It's hard to keep track of the whole internet.

02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:48.920
It is hard to keep track of the whole internet. It is. But, but the thing is that when we first

02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:53.640
started the show, it was a live show on live through CC five. And then as soon as it actually,

02:19:53.640 --> 02:19:58.200
and people sometimes forget this for a little while, the podcast was always meant to be the

02:19:58.200 --> 02:20:04.040
spinoff. And in the very beginning, we had the OLR to go edition. So for about a year,

02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:08.840
we were doing what was designed to be a 20 minute show on all gaming news.

02:20:08.840 --> 02:20:13.880
That was dial-up back then. Well, even that it was a 20 minute show on all gaming news

02:20:13.880 --> 02:20:19.880
to go with our three hour Bamani and music show. And then after about a year, we started to realize,

02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:25.960
um, this to go thing got us on the news. Uh, there's more people listening to this, like,

02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:30.920
like 25, like, like double digit times, the number of people listening to this and listening to us

02:20:30.920 --> 02:20:34.760
live. So it was kind of like one of those, maybe podcasting is kind of where we need to shift this

02:20:34.760 --> 02:20:39.960
other thing too, but we didn't want to lose the magic of what we do live. You know, there aren't

02:20:39.960 --> 02:20:45.240
a lot of podcasts that do what we're doing. It's hard to say now because of Twitch and things like

02:20:45.240 --> 02:20:48.440
that. It's kind of like, well, actually, yeah, more people are doing the live chatting and all

02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:52.920
that stuff, but you know, there aren't a lot of straight up podcasts out there that take live

02:20:52.920 --> 02:20:57.400
calls and stuff. So the whole live environment and, and the fact that we're all in one room,

02:20:58.200 --> 02:21:02.120
I think too, and there has been times where it's like, do we really need to all be in one room?

02:21:02.120 --> 02:21:08.120
But I think it kind of brings a magic to this show that Skype shows don't always have. It's

02:21:08.120 --> 02:21:11.400
hard to do it through Skype. It is. It's very hard. I mean, cause there was, there was many

02:21:11.400 --> 02:21:14.200
months where you were on Skype. There's many months where Loki was on Skype, but that was

02:21:14.200 --> 02:21:19.400
never the permanent plan. You know, it's always came back to us in one room. And I'll tell you

02:21:19.400 --> 02:21:24.120
this, the three months I was off the show was fucking hard. Yeah. It was really hard.

02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:29.960
Yes. SSJ 100, Matt podcasting. It's so much fun. Yes. To that day that has ruined that phrase for

02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:36.040
me ever. I can every time, like I'm about to say it, I don't say it because, Oh, you want to eat

02:21:36.040 --> 02:21:42.520
at work in one of my training manuals, I found the word plausible and I changed it. Thanks to

02:21:42.520 --> 02:21:47.720
our chatters. So just, it doesn't, this show doesn't only ruin your life, just putting it

02:21:47.720 --> 02:21:51.880
out there. But anyway, what else was I going to say with that? Oh yeah. I didn't want to sound

02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:56.600
like I was shading Skype shows at all. I've done plenty of them, uh, of spinoff shows and I still

02:21:56.600 --> 02:22:03.160
do my reading is fundamentals over Skype. And I love it. I love it. But that is, that is a magic

02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:08.760
for those shows. What we have going here is unique to what we're doing here. And. You know, I just

02:22:08.760 --> 02:22:12.440
don't, if, if Skype were to ever be the permanent solution, I think we would be better off just

02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:16.200
saying, you know what, it's time to end OLR and move on to a different project. So the next

02:22:16.200 --> 02:22:21.320
question, what is your motivation to do this show every week or what goal do you wish to achieve

02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:28.680
with it? Um, I will go ahead and say right now, it's the big thing I look forward to every week.

02:22:28.680 --> 02:22:37.400
It's almost like my transition of the week, you know, for me, it's my indicator. It's the

02:22:37.400 --> 02:22:45.640
culmination of my week, if that makes sense. And then I go and I start my new work week. It really,

02:22:45.640 --> 02:22:52.440
I don't know, almost adds, and this is apart from just loving gaming and loving who we podcast with,

02:22:52.440 --> 02:23:00.760
but I'm looking at it more in terms of its position in my life. It's my weekly transition

02:23:00.760 --> 02:23:07.800
and without it, I was really off, off kilter. I mean, I would know my days, you know,

02:23:08.360 --> 02:23:14.920
but I wouldn't have that, that one pivoting part in my week that I was looking forward to every

02:23:14.920 --> 02:23:21.240
week. And so it's kind of hard to put that into words. I mean, apart from just doing the show

02:23:21.240 --> 02:23:26.840
anyway, because, you know, I love gaming. I love you guys. Um, I, I like everybody in this room,

02:23:26.840 --> 02:23:36.200
mostly kidding. Um, but it's, I feel kind of empty without it. I, I, no, I hear you loud and clear.

02:23:36.200 --> 02:23:41.400
Maybe this is something not everybody out there can understand, but like the weeks that we aren't

02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:46.520
doing OLR, I find myself going, Oh, it's six o'clock. I should be on OLR right now. Or,

02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:50.600
Oh, it's five 45. It's about time for Bobby to call us no matter where I am. And I think

02:23:50.600 --> 02:23:54.200
it's something about like, it's just become like such a hat. Like I think churches for some people,

02:23:54.200 --> 02:23:57.880
I don't want to sound sacrilegious or anything, but I think, I think church is kind of that reset

02:23:57.880 --> 02:24:02.440
for some people in that way, that equilibrium. And I definitely feel that as well. And I'm not

02:24:02.440 --> 02:24:07.080
going to lie. The discipline to do this show is hard. Sometimes I have wanted to walk away from

02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:11.640
the show in the past it's happened. We've all hit that point, but then you find that thing

02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:15.960
that kind of brings you back. You know, there's that, there's that email that I'll tell you what

02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:20.040
this, this, these, this fucking changed my life. And it reminds me why I do all our there'll be

02:24:20.040 --> 02:24:27.400
that email that comes in that says for me anyway, that says, Rob, I didn't know you could be gay and

02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:31.960
like video games. And then that was okay. And like, for me, that's been like a huge motivator

02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:36.920
in what has continued at least for me. And I'm sure, you know, Jamie and Loki have had

02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:42.680
stuff from their perspectives as well. But yeah, I mean, I'm going to be honest, even recently,

02:24:42.680 --> 02:24:48.840
like the thought had crossed my mind months ago. I was like, maybe episode 700 is a nice round

02:24:48.840 --> 02:24:53.320
number to end it on. Maybe, maybe, maybe kind of like lost. Remember when that show was on the

02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:57.160
air, they set the end date like two years in the future. Maybe we just need to say this is the day

02:24:57.160 --> 02:25:02.760
it ends and stick to it. And then that way it's not going to catch anybody off guard. But then,

02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:06.200
but then something always happens that kind of just makes you go,

02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:10.680
but like, what the fuck would I do my do with myself without it? And there is going to come

02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:14.040
a point in my life where I'm going to have to answer that question. This isn't going to last

02:25:14.040 --> 02:25:20.760
forever. It is going to end someday. But I just, I'm not ready to answer yet. And I don't think

02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:23.720
Jamie is, I don't know. I don't think Matt is either. I don't know. Anything you want to add

02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:30.040
to that, Matt? I don't know. Like if I'm not doing the show on like Sundays, then

02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:37.800
it's like a few more hours. I have to spend the kids. And plus it shows like, you know, it's,

02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:43.480
I don't work in the game industry anymore. So like I can't talk games to anybody. Cause like my,

02:25:43.480 --> 02:25:48.120
my coworkers, I literally work in the department full of old women. Well, not necessarily old

02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:53.000
women, just women. I have one, actually my coworker, he plays Overwatch. So I, you know,

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:57.640
I talked to him, but like, I've got nobody to talk to other than, other than that. So this is like my

02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:01.480
other than that. So this is like my outlet. Otherwise they'd be like my son who just like,

02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:09.160
you know, verbal vomit all the time. Just like, here's my chain of thought. I'm just going to

02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:16.280
keep it going. And it's like, okay, I can only listen to that so long, but no, I mean, yeah,

02:26:16.280 --> 02:26:21.560
I do this as long as I can. And I will go on record saying that I would take a bullet for

02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:29.160
anybody in this house on record, even maybe Sanrio. She doesn't run first.

02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:33.160
That's that's very, that's very, very sweet. But in general, let's hope it doesn't come to that.

02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:40.120
But I'm saying that coming here and being with you guys every week, it's for me, it's wonderful. So

02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:44.840
now, now before I say something else, maybe cry next email, please.

02:26:45.080 --> 02:26:46.840
The fuck? I know there's more to this email.

02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:51.720
I mean, yeah, sorry. Yay. But is it going to be more sap?

02:26:52.600 --> 02:26:56.520
Okay. All right. What are your plans for the future of the podcast? I've read that

02:26:56.520 --> 02:27:01.080
Apple plans to provide podcast analytics that show more information about podcast

02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:05.880
listeners. What do you think about that? I got no free time to look at that.

02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:09.800
We're not doing it for how many people listen. We're doing it because we,

02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:13.560
because the ones who do already, I can tell mine more people.

02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:17.560
I can tell you straight up. I don't know how many people listen to this show.

02:27:18.120 --> 02:27:22.600
I don't. Can I find it? I think so. I think I know the report I need to run

02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:25.800
to find how many people listen to the show. I know how many people were listening to this

02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:31.160
show at one point. I know how many were listening to it at its peak. And I know it came down by

02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:35.000
quite a bit since the peak. And that's, that's okay. As there's been more stuff and more options

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:41.240
out there to listen to people, though, I am a little bit curious. I know people are curious,

02:27:41.240 --> 02:27:44.360
but I don't come from, it's like, you know, you don't want to get in that mindset of thinking

02:27:44.360 --> 02:27:48.920
about how many listeners you have. It's just like it because it's always going to eat away.

02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:52.040
It's like, Oh, we only have this many or, Oh, you know, we have this many,

02:27:52.040 --> 02:27:57.080
we had 12 at one time. We had 12 on the first episode and the only look in chat. Now we have

02:27:57.080 --> 02:28:03.400
44 people in chat minus robots and so forth. So I, you know what? There's at least some people

02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:06.920
would kill to have 30 people give a shit about what they have to say. You know what I mean?

02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:14.520
And so it's just, whether it's 30 or it's 30,000, it's not 30,000. I'm grateful that y'all give a

02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:18.680
shit and that you're here to join in on this. Sorry, Jamie. I'm in a podcast community on

02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:23.160
Facebook, just like, you know, people helping each other, talking about equipment. And I see

02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:28.280
these people with these huge mungus rigs and all they're talking about is their analytics. All

02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:32.200
they're talking about is their numbers. All they're talking about is their funding. And I'm like,

02:28:32.200 --> 02:28:38.840
where is the love? You know, are you trying to make a career out of this or are you doing it

02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:44.360
because you love it? Oh yeah. I've, I've said something similar to that in a room full of

02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:49.800
podcasters and you would have thought I just like did what Sinead O'Connor did on Saturday Night

02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:56.280
Live and tore up a picture of the Pope. Like it's, it's a different mindset for different people,

02:28:56.280 --> 02:29:01.720
but there are two to be fair. There are a lot of podcasters that do do it out of the love,

02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:05.400
but then there's always that thinking about, I mean, the money with a lot of people too,

02:29:05.400 --> 02:29:09.800
that kind of like if they're doing it as their career and this is my income, yeah,

02:29:09.800 --> 02:29:13.720
you're going to be thinking about the way it's like, am I going to be able to afford rent next

02:29:13.720 --> 02:29:19.160
month? I mean, that's, you know, they're more lucrative things to get into other than podcasting.

02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:23.880
Don't get me wrong. The coin is great. And if somebody were to come to OLR and offer us the

02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:30.280
coin, as long as we still had the freedom to do exactly what we do now, I think we'd be open to

02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:36.600
that, but I'm not really motivated to go chase it down. I, I've come to peace with the fact a long

02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:42.040
time ago, we're not making money off of OLR. This is a labor of love, but it has brought so much

02:29:42.040 --> 02:29:48.280
in the means of like friendship and just the fact that, and I don't know if you guys feel this too,

02:29:48.280 --> 02:29:53.640
but like no matter what fucking city I go to in America, I know somebody there and it's because

02:29:53.640 --> 02:29:58.280
of this show and I've had even in other countries, even in other countries, I've had people say to me,

02:29:58.280 --> 02:30:01.640
I don't get to do a lot of like country traveling a lot. And I have people say to me, Rob, how do

02:30:01.640 --> 02:30:07.800
you fucking know people everywhere? And I'm like, it's because of the show. Yeah. Yeah. And that,

02:30:07.800 --> 02:30:14.120
that's something coin don't get you. Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't mind doing a few things to help,

02:30:14.120 --> 02:30:19.000
you know, put a little bit in our coffer, you know, for, you know, like repairing our equipment.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:23.640
You can give me biddies on Twitch. My door is open, but I don't want to beg for it.

02:30:23.640 --> 02:30:28.600
Yeah. I'm not going to, you know, I would rather put out, you know, if it was going to do something,

02:30:28.600 --> 02:30:34.440
I'd want to put out like a product that people would enjoy that enhances their experience with

02:30:34.440 --> 02:30:41.000
the show and not just because, you know, we want to go to Disneyland. I mean, I want to go to

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:45.480
Disneyland, but I see some folks in chat talking about Patreon and is that something that we're

02:30:45.480 --> 02:30:55.000
shading or whatever? No. I mean, you need to do what works for you. I personally do not want to

02:30:55.000 --> 02:31:03.320
go to Patreon because I want to answer to no one with this show other than myself and my co-host.

02:31:03.320 --> 02:31:06.840
Honestly, though, though, the Patreon thing, I think it used to be like a lot of that was

02:31:06.840 --> 02:31:11.320
gated by like, I watch a lot of different shows. Most of the shows I watch now, especially on

02:31:11.320 --> 02:31:16.840
YouTube, have Patreons. And the way they do it is like, you know, we're doing this show for free.

02:31:16.840 --> 02:31:21.720
If you want to support us, cool. If you don't, that's fine. And I, you know, and that's, that's,

02:31:21.720 --> 02:31:24.760
that's kind of why I'm taking the approach with Twitch and stuff that I have. And that's,

02:31:24.760 --> 02:31:29.000
that's totally awesome. Like, again, I'm not shading people to choose to use Patreon.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:34.680
Go for it. That's awesome. I just, again, this is a me thing and my mental block. I feel like

02:31:35.480 --> 02:31:41.000
when I open it up to someone else financially supporting this show that said people would have

02:31:42.200 --> 02:31:46.680
a say in, and even though, you know, we do want to open it up to the listeners on stuff,

02:31:46.680 --> 02:31:49.800
it's still on our terms. Does that make sense? It's still our house.

02:31:49.800 --> 02:31:55.640
I will say this though, that, and maybe it's a discussion for another day, but I was looking

02:31:55.640 --> 02:32:01.960
at, there are other YouTubers who use Patreon who take no input for what they do. You know,

02:32:01.960 --> 02:32:07.640
they don't do the levels they do just as a donation thing. And then may have like the

02:32:07.640 --> 02:32:15.480
occasional prize for a level or something. But you know, I, I had thought about it. I'm not

02:32:15.480 --> 02:32:20.520
really, I, I don't think it would affect what we do, but it wouldn't add to what we do right now.

02:32:21.240 --> 02:32:25.080
I will say this, and I am going to shade something here real quick. I am going to be shady. Get your

02:32:25.080 --> 02:32:28.360
shade button ready because I'm going to tell you, and this, this is just an answer to the question.

02:32:28.920 --> 02:32:34.600
The thing that has pissed me off, I mean, pissed me off as a video game podcaster more than

02:32:34.600 --> 02:32:40.760
anything else in my 15 years of doing this was when I saw that show going to Kickstarter saying

02:32:40.760 --> 02:32:45.480
they needed $30,000 to do their show. And y'all, y'all can do your own research if you want to

02:32:45.480 --> 02:32:51.320
know. And I don't know those people. I don't know that show, but I'm just saying on a principle level

02:32:51.320 --> 02:32:57.640
to say, we need to do a studio or we need to rent a studio space to do this show, or we need the

02:32:57.640 --> 02:33:03.240
money to travel to Conner. We need $30,000. I'm sorry. And you know, maybe I'm going to get shit

02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:07.560
for this if this gets back to them, but Oh, well, I'm just going to say from my perspective,

02:33:07.560 --> 02:33:11.240
as somebody who has never made a dime off this show, who's doing it in the spare room. And so

02:33:11.240 --> 02:33:17.800
this stuff, you don't need $30,000 to do a fucking podcast. And if you're doing, I mean,

02:33:18.840 --> 02:33:25.080
I don't know. I just, I think you send the wrong message with that. I want people to feel empowered

02:33:25.080 --> 02:33:33.080
that they can do a podcast with a fucking iPhone, Android recorder and enthusiasm,

02:33:33.080 --> 02:33:36.920
if that's all they've got. Yeah. Anyway, that's all I have to say on that. I agree.

02:33:37.560 --> 02:33:41.880
So that's the, I'll go ahead and wrap up with this email. Sorry if my email contains any mistakes.

02:33:41.880 --> 02:33:46.520
No, your email was great. Look at all the brands you got us on. I mean, props to you, right?

02:33:46.520 --> 02:33:51.960
Greetings and thank you for your podcast Lorcan from Germany. Thank you Lorcan, which is a name

02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:57.400
I don't hear a lot in the email bag. So very good email tonight. All right, moving on. We have two

02:33:58.200 --> 02:34:05.960
left. Hold on. I think I might be reading these out of order. Nope, I'm not. By the way,

02:34:05.960 --> 02:34:10.280
background music is great days. Sega Genesis chiptune cover by blast processed.

02:34:10.920 --> 02:34:19.400
You'll need to download this. So we got a happy 15th music thing. Oh, we did? We did.

02:34:19.640 --> 02:34:23.880
I didn't run ma. Oh, I didn't. Oh, I got it. That means I got a log in the mail bag over here. Yep.

02:34:23.880 --> 02:34:27.320
So while you do that, I will pull that up, go to the next one and I'll pull that up. Okay.

02:34:28.520 --> 02:34:32.120
Hey, OLR. I just wanted to share some of my thoughts about E3.

02:34:34.200 --> 02:34:37.800
Sony, I wasn't too impressed with Sony's conferences. It had a lot of updates from

02:34:37.800 --> 02:34:41.800
last year. They didn't have much that was really new this time around. Missing in action, deep

02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:47.800
down, bloodborne two, DMC five, death stranding, gameplay, et cetera. I did appreciate the fact

02:34:47.800 --> 02:34:54.280
that Sony showed the games and stuck to it. Microsoft 4K, 4K, 4K, 4K, 4K. I was impressed

02:34:54.280 --> 02:35:00.600
with the Xbox one X somewhat with a $500 price point. It seems that Microsoft is trying to edge

02:35:00.600 --> 02:35:06.360
out the competition by throwing out hardware specs to justify their gaming thug. What I thought was

02:35:06.360 --> 02:35:13.960
interesting was that the systems would have 12 gig of a GDR five Ram. Um, the 10 80 TI graphics

02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:20.440
card has 11 gigs and costs around at least $700. As you said in the last episode, Rob,

02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:25.320
I'm happy that I see 4k a lot more in action, but I don't think I need the Xbox one X to do it.

02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:31.320
Guess now is a good time to future proof my PC for 4k gaming.

02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:33.800
You and I are in the same mindset. Who's this emailer?

02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:36.440
I'll tell you when to finish. Okay. Tristan.

02:35:36.440 --> 02:35:40.520
Okay. Tristan, Tristan, you and I are in a very similar mindset. I don't see the need for the

02:35:40.520 --> 02:35:45.560
Xbox one as much as I do. I think that's a great way to put it future proof my PC from where gaming

02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:50.840
is going. That's a great way to put it to be fair for a 4k machine for 99. You can't build a 4k

02:35:50.840 --> 02:35:54.840
machine for four 99. And that's totally, yeah, exactly. You got to make a choice.

02:35:56.360 --> 02:36:00.200
Nintendo. I didn't get around to seeing their presentation, but I was very impressed.

02:36:00.200 --> 02:36:05.240
There are two Metro titles coming out, Metro prime four and Metro two return of Samus remake

02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:09.240
as a shame it's coming to the 3DS only and not the switch.

02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:12.680
It seems that they are listening to their fans and at least it's something

02:36:12.680 --> 02:36:16.200
Rob. I know it's not F zero, but Hey, we'll take what we can get. Haha.

02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:21.480
I thought that the developer digital press conference was amazing. It pretty much showed

02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:27.160
their new upcoming titles while taking potshots at the gaming industry. It's worth a watch.

02:36:27.160 --> 02:36:30.760
I missed the Devolver thing. Did you watch it? I just saw some of the live tweets about it.

02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:35.560
They had it. Okay. So I missed it, but it was, it was like a 30 minute show.

02:36:36.520 --> 02:36:40.520
It was like a fake show making fun of the industry. Then they have this like several

02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:46.040
hour long pre pre-show that was absolutely annoying, but I mean,

02:36:47.640 --> 02:36:52.920
neat, I guess that they're poking fun at shows, but like we all do that. So yeah,

02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:57.240
I like the sassy stuff though. I'll go, but I like shady stuff. It's why I watch drag race.

02:36:57.240 --> 02:37:00.120
Very much like Tim and Eric adult swim kind of stuff.

02:37:00.520 --> 02:37:07.160
All right. My game of the show is dragon ball fighter Z. Yes, yes, yes, yes. It pretty much

02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:12.200
took the Marvel versus Capcom formula, tweaked it and made it look so damn good. Everyone that's

02:37:12.200 --> 02:37:16.520
played it fell in love with it instantly. It's got a lot of nominations from the gaming press

02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:21.240
and was truly well-deserved. The fact that our system works is behind the development makes me

02:37:21.240 --> 02:37:25.720
feel confident that they will put, pull out all the stops to ensure the consumer has their hand

02:37:25.720 --> 02:37:30.520
on a complete and competent product. Unlike street fighter five shade button. There's no

02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:36.200
battle toads. In addition, the game is gunning for an Evo slot next year and I hope it gets it.

02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:43.160
Oh my God. I would kill. I I'm gagging already. This is great. I did you ever watch any of the

02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:46.920
gameplay for it? And I'm not really just saying this because I'm on a dragon ball kick. I think

02:37:46.920 --> 02:37:52.520
this game would have been enough to get me back on a dragon ball kick. So, and I played the shit show

02:37:52.520 --> 02:37:59.640
that was, you know, the GT game back in the day and sold it. SSG-100 Matt in chat says, I hope

02:38:00.360 --> 02:38:05.160
Dragon Ball Fighter Z outsells Marvel versus Capcom Infinite. It could, honestly. Yeah, it

02:38:05.160 --> 02:38:11.560
could. I wouldn't be mad about that at all. I mean, I'll be honest. I saw the, well, the next

02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:18.200
part actually is addressed to me, so I'll do my, my thoughts on that. Dark Sakura, as a fighting

02:38:18.280 --> 02:38:22.360
game player like myself, what's your take on Marvel versus Capcom Infinite so far?

02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:26.920
The story demo that was released left a bad taste in my mouth, but for those who played the E3 build

02:38:26.920 --> 02:38:31.240
had something different to say. Looks fun, but the visuals look like ass. They have three months

02:38:31.240 --> 02:38:36.440
to polish it and I feel that a delay would be best to clean up. It won't happen, but that's how it

02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:45.480
goes. It could have looked better. I wasn't really too mad at the art style. I didn't hate it. I did

02:38:45.480 --> 02:38:50.600
have some issues with, like, how are these people back in the same universe again? And I fucking am

02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:57.160
sick of Ultron, so. It's because Ultron merged both their universe. With Sigma? Yeah, he merged with

02:38:57.160 --> 02:39:02.360
Sigma, which merged their two universes. So, like, for example, one of the levels that's in the story

02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:12.520
demo is Asgard and X's world. It's like, they call it X-Guard. Okay. Well, I think the, the concept

02:39:12.520 --> 02:39:16.840
behind it is really cool and my love for fighting games isn't necessarily just because you can

02:39:16.840 --> 02:39:20.760
fight, but I love the stories that go along with them and I love the characters in it.

02:39:20.760 --> 02:39:26.840
I think you can make a fighting game that could be fun, but if the characters aren't as fleshed out,

02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:33.960
like, don't have a story or motivation, then they're, they kind of go below 2D for me. You

02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:41.800
know what I mean? And so I was, I saw the trailer for it. I thought some of the things were kind of

02:39:41.800 --> 02:39:46.120
dumb, but I love the cast of characters I saw so far. You know, especially, you know,

02:39:46.120 --> 02:39:51.080
Strider Hear You has been probably one of my mainstays in all the Marvel versus Capcom games.

02:39:51.080 --> 02:39:54.520
I blame my husband for that because my husband's favorite game for a long time was Strider.

02:39:56.120 --> 02:40:04.440
However, I next saw Dragon Ball FighterZ after that and I was like, oh, that kind of blows it

02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:12.680
away. So I will play it. I mean, certainly we're going to have it in my house. It's,

02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:18.840
it's kind of goes without saying, but I am not as excited about it as I might've been seeing what

02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:25.320
else is coming out and hearing. So I didn't play the demo. I didn't play it. I did watch though,

02:40:25.320 --> 02:40:31.080
a lot of the movies for it. So I can't really base a judgment on what I haven't played,

02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:37.960
but just looking side by side reading reviews. And again, I'm very picky with reviews. I would

02:40:37.960 --> 02:40:44.440
rather form my own opinion, but I'm, I'm still, I'm still happy about it. I'm still a little bit

02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:52.120
excited, but I'm more excited for Dragon Ball. So that's my thing on it to answer that question.

02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:56.200
So thanks. Oh, go ahead. Sorry. I was just going to finish up the email. What were you saying? No,

02:40:56.200 --> 02:41:00.520
go ahead. I have a random thought. Thanks so much for reading my email. I truly enjoy hearing you

02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:05.000
guys over the past decade and congrats on your 15th anniversary of orange challenge radio.

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:09.640
Keep up the awesome work and just know you have a loyal listener from Maryland,

02:41:09.640 --> 02:41:11.800
Tristan. Thank you. What up Maryland?

02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:17.560
So they know they're in chat. They're still trying to say, Oh, is he going to take a bet?

02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:22.200
You know, the Dragon Ball fighter Z will sell more than Marvel vs Capcom where the tingle

02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:28.760
cost. Listen, that's over. We are more bets. No more bets. If I can lose enough weight where I

02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:34.760
can pull that off sexy like, then sure. Why not? But like, it's going to be, he'll just do it for

02:41:34.760 --> 02:41:41.080
fun. If he loses that much weight, just like beef up the package. You're not going to want to see

02:41:41.080 --> 02:41:46.040
that. Did you download the file? I did. So I believe this is an audio message similar to what

02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:51.720
we got from game buoy, except this one came in via the mailbag other than Dropbox. So we will listen

02:41:51.720 --> 02:41:56.120
to it and I'm taking a big risk, not screening this first, but we'll listen to it now.

02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:05.160
Hey everybody. This is DJ Van Ness. I'm here with Ari Rockefeller and Mako Chan.

02:42:05.960 --> 02:42:12.520
We're getting together real quick to wish Orange Lounge Radio 15 years of excellence. So it's their

02:42:12.520 --> 02:42:18.360
15th anniversary. So figure we get together, jump on Skype and just say some kind words.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:25.480
Does that sound good? Yeah, it sounds great. Okay. Sure. Well, Mako, you sound pretty happy.

02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:36.520
Yeah, I'm grumpy catting it. Fine. Let's do this. So Rob, Jamie, Matt, happy anniversary.

02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:42.920
If it wasn't for you guys, it wouldn't be an anime jam session. So I'm thankful for that

02:42:42.920 --> 02:42:48.760
and all that good stuff. So have a great anniversary and have many, many more.

02:42:48.760 --> 02:42:53.320
Anime jam session owes its origins to

02:42:53.320 --> 02:42:57.320
Orange Lounge Radio. So what we do is partially your fault.

02:42:58.200 --> 02:43:05.320
And we're sorry, but not really. Love you guys.

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:11.320
You see what I put up with every week. All right.

02:43:11.320 --> 02:43:19.160
That was a very cute message. Thank you very much. Even if Mako Chan didn't sound

02:43:19.160 --> 02:43:23.800
like she wanted to be there, but I just, I like that. Sorry for waking you up.

02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:29.000
Yeah, it's not like I woke her up. Hearts you guys. No, I love, no, that was great. Thank you

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:33.800
so much. Hearts and hearts. I've said this before, those types of compliments about

02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:38.760
what you guys did kind of showed me that we could do our own show and, you know, the anime jam

02:43:38.760 --> 02:43:44.200
session and so forth. And the other shows that I've heard this from is just, there is no greater

02:43:44.200 --> 02:43:49.480
compliment, I don't think, to what we do here at OLR than hearing that. So thank you. Thank you

02:43:49.480 --> 02:43:58.280
very much for that. So, all right. Is that it for emails tonight? All right. Participate at

02:43:58.280 --> 02:44:02.680
OrangeLoungeRadio.com. You can always send us an email for our next show in two weeks. Because

02:44:02.680 --> 02:44:06.680
again, I didn't state this at the beginning of the show, but I've said it a million times before,

02:44:06.680 --> 02:44:12.520
we will not be here next week. Our reward for 15 years of OLR? A fucking night off.

02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:17.240
And actually, again, Dark Sakura is going to be at San Francisco Pride. I'm going to be at Chicago

02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:22.120
Pride. So we are traveling all over, over next weekend, but we'll be back in two weeks just in

02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:27.000
time for the 4th of July weekend. Won't that be fun? All right. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:30.200
if you want to send us an email for that show. We do have some more stories to get through.

02:44:30.200 --> 02:44:33.560
However, since we are at nine o'clock here, which means midnight on the East Coast, and we still

02:44:33.560 --> 02:44:36.840
haven't even got to calls, I do want to ask that we hit the fast forward button on these stories.

02:44:36.840 --> 02:44:39.640
So we just have three stories here. We're going to just do the bullet points from these stories,

02:44:39.640 --> 02:44:44.840
please. Loki. Yeah. So Microsoft is putting out, they're redoing their whole avatar system. And so

02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:51.880
they've got brand new avatars that are, you know, 4K ready, HDR, all that fun stuff. But what's

02:44:51.880 --> 02:44:57.880
kind of cool about these though, is they've really amped up the models in there. So for example,

02:44:57.880 --> 02:45:01.880
they're going to have different body types, even some that encompass individuals that might be

02:45:01.880 --> 02:45:06.280
disabled as well. So like some of the ones that are showing off, they had a girl with, you know,

02:45:06.280 --> 02:45:11.080
an artificial arm, they had someone in a wheelchair. And I gotta say, these avatars look

02:45:11.080 --> 02:45:15.320
fucking awesome, you know, compared to like some of the stuff that they had before. That's how I

02:45:15.320 --> 02:45:19.800
kind of really wish that Nintendo would step up, like the Miis and stuff to something like this,

02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:23.000
because honestly, these look fantastic. So props to Microsoft.

02:45:24.280 --> 02:45:28.040
Atari is working on something as well. And some of you guys have been shouting this out in chat.

02:45:28.040 --> 02:45:32.520
This is different from what Dark Soccer talked about earlier. The actual company Atari is making

02:45:32.520 --> 02:45:38.280
something called an AtariBox. There's a video over at AtariBox.com that's teasing a brand new Atari

02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:43.640
project. Some folks have reached out to Atari and they have said, yes, it is real. There is actually

02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:48.200
a partner involved, although they have not said who that partner is. So no idea what this is. I

02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:52.360
mean, some folks have speculated it could be like an Android-based console, although chances are,

02:45:52.360 --> 02:45:56.840
whatever the hell it is, it's probably going to have a bunch of Atari games preloaded on it.

02:45:56.840 --> 02:46:01.480
I guess maybe, maybe an evolution of those. Remember the Coleco Chameleon was supposed

02:46:01.480 --> 02:46:08.520
to use the old Jaguar shells? Maybe this is going to use Jaguar shells as well.

02:46:08.520 --> 02:46:12.040
Well, just let's hope this ends up a little bit better. Jamie, last but not least,

02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:18.440
you have something for us, I think. Yeah, it's about Microsoft and our robot overlords.

02:46:19.720 --> 02:46:26.440
Basically, Microsoft researchers are testing AI and machine learning. And so they've created an

02:46:26.440 --> 02:46:35.880
AI system that can hit the, in theory, the maximum score for the Atari 2600 adaption of Ms. Pac-Man.

02:46:35.880 --> 02:46:44.360
No human has done this, but the machine, our robot overlord, tested by reinforcement learning,

02:46:45.240 --> 02:46:48.920
has hit the high score. So try that Billy Mitchell.

02:46:49.560 --> 02:46:57.800
Nice. So not only can robots name hamsters, but they can get the high score on Ms. Pac-Man.

02:46:57.800 --> 02:47:03.800
But can they do both at the same time? Yes, they can actually.

02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:10.440
Right. The Skype line is open if you want to give us a call. 1-877-GAMELR, the old-fashioned way,

02:47:10.440 --> 02:47:16.040
but I think y'all are on Skype now. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. Just think,

02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:21.720
when we get the Discord, we'll be able to open it up so we can do group calls, if that's the thing.

02:47:21.720 --> 02:47:24.360
I don't know. I don't know if that's the thing we actually want to do. More like, oh shit.

02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:28.520
Yeah, right. All right, let's go to the phone. Oh my God, we've got a million things coming in.

02:47:28.520 --> 02:47:33.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Hey, this is Acteft. Hi, Acteft. What's on your

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:41.000
mind, buddy? Oh, hi. Hola todos. First of all, well, congratulations on your 15 year,

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:45.720
on your quinceanera. Thank you very much. My dress is lovely tonight. I'm sorry you couldn't see it.

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:56.520
Well, since it's a quinceanera, I definitely have to do this. So sorry for the bad singing,

02:47:56.520 --> 02:48:01.640
but yeah. Yay, we get the quinceanera song. I'm so excited. Yes, please. Not really the quinceanera,

02:48:01.640 --> 02:48:06.600
but the manganitas. So here it goes.

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:29.960
Rob was dancing.

02:48:29.960 --> 02:48:33.480
I was. I was doing a little dance and you all are blessed that you couldn't see it.

02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:41.000
Remember we were going to do periscopes of certain parts of the show. Let's all be thankful

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:45.320
that didn't happen. Thank you very much. That takes guts to sing here on the program. So thank

02:48:45.320 --> 02:48:50.920
you very much. Yeah, I'm well aware. You're getting some bravos from our chat room and

02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:54.600
come on Nogas says yes a las muchachas bonitas.

02:48:57.080 --> 02:49:04.120
Very well done. Well, again, I want to thank you all for being there every Sunday or most

02:49:05.240 --> 02:49:13.080
Sundays. And I already said on Twitter and Facebook, but you guys have inspired so many

02:49:13.080 --> 02:49:20.760
people, including me. A year ago, I started my podcast and you guys were pretty much the

02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:28.520
inspiration for it, along with other podcasts like Black Wolf, Game Buoy, Travis Donovan, and then

02:49:28.520 --> 02:49:37.080
BSL. But again, you guys have inspired so many people to do what you always say, to share our

02:49:37.080 --> 02:49:44.840
voice. And I really want to thank you for that. It's really, really great that you do it for love

02:49:44.840 --> 02:49:54.760
and you speak your voice without any sort of restriction. And again, you're an inspiration

02:49:54.760 --> 02:50:00.360
for all of us. I want to thank you very much for that. And thank you for what you do in that. And

02:50:00.360 --> 02:50:06.120
I know you were voicing in chat earlier that you're learning that it can take time to build

02:50:06.120 --> 02:50:11.240
up an audience for your show, but you are still working at it and not letting that go. And, you

02:50:11.240 --> 02:50:16.760
know, never lose sight of that, that even on the darkest days, the days you're going up against the

02:50:16.760 --> 02:50:24.040
Super Bowl and the Oscars, sometimes it's about just kind of like the fact that going through the

02:50:24.040 --> 02:50:28.280
motions of doing the show and being there and having a good time with your friends, if nothing

02:50:28.280 --> 02:50:35.160
else, you know? Yeah, especially that. I have lots of fun with my friends talking, doing stupid

02:50:35.160 --> 02:50:41.640
stuff. But yeah, it's really bad. And if people like that, I'm happy with it.

02:50:42.520 --> 02:50:46.680
That's the absolute right attitude to have, Act F, and I think you'll have much success if you

02:50:46.680 --> 02:50:51.560
keep that attitude on. Well, again, thanks. Thanks for everything.

02:50:51.560 --> 02:50:54.440
Thank you, Act F. I really, really appreciate that. I'm gonna let you go to try to squeeze

02:50:54.440 --> 02:50:57.560
in some calls because we're getting a lot tonight. But thank you. Have a good one. And thanks for the

02:50:57.560 --> 02:51:00.120
song. Thanks for having me. Gracias.

02:51:00.920 --> 02:51:02.920
No, no. Bye-bye.

02:51:04.040 --> 02:51:07.880
All right, lighting up tonight. Who would have thought? Let's go to another call.

02:51:07.880 --> 02:51:09.400
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?

02:51:10.200 --> 02:51:12.280
Hey, Ralph. This is Reggie Nader.

02:51:12.280 --> 02:51:13.560
Hey, buddy. What's on your mind tonight?

02:51:14.520 --> 02:51:20.040
Well, since this is your 15-year anniversary, I just want to call in and say thank you for

02:51:21.400 --> 02:51:23.000
doing your show all these years.

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:23.880
Thank you for being here.

02:51:24.840 --> 02:51:33.720
Yeah, it's honestly one of the better shows that I've been listening to. And in fact,

02:51:34.760 --> 02:51:41.160
between your show – well, I already said this in chat, but I might as well see on the call – it's

02:51:41.160 --> 02:51:50.520
your show and Bobby's show are what inspired me to get my original PC that way I can listen to

02:51:51.400 --> 02:51:53.160
your shows that way.

02:51:53.160 --> 02:51:58.840
I was going to say, I seem to recall in the early days of OLR, you were talking about how

02:51:58.840 --> 02:52:04.280
your most current system was a Nintendo 64. And now you've come a long way in being able to kind

02:52:04.280 --> 02:52:09.000
of tell us like, hey, hey, this game's free. Go get it while it's free. And hey, hey, have you

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:13.880
played Magic the Gathering 2014 yet? And it's like, you've come quite the long way yourself

02:52:13.880 --> 02:52:19.240
from the, I only have a Nintendo 64. Am I still a gamer? To which, may I remind you, we said,

02:52:19.240 --> 02:52:20.200
yes, of course you are.

02:52:20.840 --> 02:52:31.880
Yeah, speaking of which, your comment there brings up my next point. Just before my transition

02:52:31.880 --> 02:52:41.080
from console gaming to PC gaming, I remember you constantly talking about Steam and the summer sales

02:52:41.080 --> 02:52:49.400
and this sale, that sale, and yada, yada, yada. And that was largely the reason why

02:52:50.520 --> 02:52:57.320
I said, you know, to hell with replacing my PS3. I might as well, if anything, go get a PC

02:52:58.040 --> 02:53:05.480
and at least try out the Steam thing, see if it's any good. And well, you know what happened

02:53:05.480 --> 02:53:09.560
since then, you know, constantly calling your show and Bobby's show and talking about,

02:53:09.560 --> 02:53:11.160
I've created a monster.

02:53:12.680 --> 02:53:17.880
Yeah, well, I was going to say, no, I'm a Steam addict and you're my dealer.

02:53:18.200 --> 02:53:24.920
Great. That makes me feel real good. No, I, no, it does. I mean, the fact that, you know,

02:53:25.560 --> 02:53:30.120
that shit ain't cheap. And the fact that like, based on our recommendation, you drop that kind

02:53:30.120 --> 02:53:35.960
of money on that, that's, that just, it just blows my fucking mind. Like I, it really does.

02:53:36.840 --> 02:53:42.040
Yeah. Well, bear in mind, you know, well, not to go into the whole deal

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:49.480
in tangent, because that's not why I called, but in full fairness now, yes, I do have a lot of gains,

02:53:49.480 --> 02:53:56.680
but I very, very few, you know, that might pay a full price. And in fact, a lot of which I got

02:53:56.680 --> 02:54:02.280
for free. So, you know, it really doesn't, didn't cost me as nearly as much money as it did,

02:54:02.280 --> 02:54:09.640
how it did seem. So, but, you know, ultimately my point is, you know, thanks to your recommendation,

02:54:09.640 --> 02:54:16.680
I'm enjoying the crap out of PC gaming and there's very, very low incentive for me to go

02:54:16.680 --> 02:54:23.000
back to console gaming. So I have, you have to think for that. Well, on one side, I want to be

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:27.800
thankful that we helped, but at the other hand, I'm not ready to push off console gaming so

02:54:27.800 --> 02:54:32.760
quickly, but I get your, I get it, RageNator. I do. I get it from your perspective. So,

02:54:33.400 --> 02:54:36.440
you know, thank you. Everybody's got to do what's right for them at the end of the day.

02:54:36.520 --> 02:54:41.080
So yeah, yeah. Yeah. Don't get me wrong. There, there are some console exclusive,

02:54:41.080 --> 02:54:46.120
blast, sorry, getting tongue-tied. Yeah. There's a couple of console exclusive games that

02:54:46.120 --> 02:54:53.080
I loved on PS3 and Xbox 360 and so on and so forth that I kind of sort of missed. Like,

02:54:53.880 --> 02:54:59.000
I know I talked about a lot, you know, back in the day about Super Stardust HE. I used to play

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:06.760
the BGS inside of that, but you know, that being said, you know, I've given a choice between

02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:13.000
console gaming and PC gaming. I think for most of why I'll stick with PC gaming. So, I mean,

02:55:13.720 --> 02:55:18.200
it's not like I'm hurting for games. There is nothing wrong with that. Any other quick

02:55:18.200 --> 02:55:21.000
thoughts? I've got a, I got a lot of calls to get through tonight. So anything else you want to get

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:28.120
out? Uh, no. And hopefully, um, I'll just end with this. Hopefully you'll, you'll, you guys

02:55:28.120 --> 02:55:36.920
will still have plenty more years to come. And I swear to God, Rob, if you quit OR anytime soon,

02:55:36.920 --> 02:55:41.320
I'm going to reach through the internet and slap the Jesus out of you. You know what? We've given

02:55:41.320 --> 02:55:47.240
you almost 700 episodes so far. So not if I do it first. When we're ready to end this show,

02:55:47.560 --> 02:55:52.040
we deserve it. Like, I'm not, I'm not, again, I'm not trying to sound like too ego or anything like

02:55:52.040 --> 02:55:58.280
that, but there is going to come a time and it's not going to be easy for anybody, but believe me,

02:55:58.280 --> 02:56:01.240
it will be the hardest for us. But people are going to read into that and be like,

02:56:01.240 --> 02:56:07.080
oh, he already knows. No, we don't. I'm just saying maybe it'll be 20 years from now. I

02:56:07.080 --> 02:56:13.320
don't fucking know, but it's going to end someday. So, you know, but hopefully it won't be any time

02:56:13.400 --> 02:56:15.800
soon. No, no time sooner. We plan in it. That's for sure.

02:56:16.600 --> 02:56:21.240
I, well, I'll have to go. So I'm sure all the people want to call it in and say,

02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:25.720
congrats to you guys, but thanks for everything. Thanks for taking my call.

02:56:25.720 --> 02:56:28.760
No worries. Thank you, buddy. Take care. Yep. You too. All right. Bye.

02:56:29.720 --> 02:56:33.960
All right. Let's get to another call. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

02:56:33.960 --> 02:56:37.080
This is Brad from pod culture. Hi, my friend. It's good to hear from you. What's up?

02:56:37.880 --> 02:56:42.520
I'll just call and say, congratulations guys on 15 years.

02:56:42.520 --> 02:56:46.600
Thank you very much. You know, you, you're, you're not such a, a child yourself when it

02:56:46.600 --> 02:56:49.880
comes to podcasting. I know. So that means a lot coming from a peer.

02:56:50.680 --> 02:56:54.360
Well, it was, uh, I guess I came into it about a year after you guys started.

02:56:55.880 --> 02:56:58.840
So yeah, you've been doing this quite a long time yourself.

02:56:58.840 --> 02:57:03.080
Oh no, just listening to you guys a couple of years after that before we actually started.

02:57:03.080 --> 02:57:06.040
Gotcha. Gotcha. Um, well, um,

02:57:06.040 --> 02:57:09.240
anything you wanted to share with listeners tonight or how are things been going for you?

02:57:10.520 --> 02:57:14.440
One things are going good, but, uh, no, they just want to call and say thanks. Cause, uh,

02:57:14.440 --> 02:57:17.800
probably you guys have been the biggest influence on our show. You know, we're

02:57:17.800 --> 02:57:21.400
three or four folks sitting around shooting the shit about stuff that we like. So, uh,

02:57:22.920 --> 02:57:28.600
And it's, it's a fun, it's a fun show that you guys do. So that's quite the compliment to hear.

02:57:29.480 --> 02:57:33.320
Okay. Well, I'll let you get some more calls, but, uh, congrats guys.

02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:36.360
Well, thank you, Brad. I really appreciate that. And there's a new episode of pod

02:57:36.360 --> 02:57:40.520
culture tomorrow at vogue, right? Yeah. It's our, uh, uh, take on wonder woman.

02:57:40.520 --> 02:57:43.640
So it should be interesting. Three dudes sitting around talking about, uh, uh,

02:57:44.200 --> 02:57:48.440
superhero and chill. Well, Hey, that's, that's okay. As long as, as long as y'all had great

02:57:48.440 --> 02:57:53.480
things to say, right? Everybody's great. Yeah, I know. Yeah, no, I, uh, I'm, I really need to

02:57:53.480 --> 02:57:57.960
see it too, but you know, time. All right. Thank you, Brad. Take care later. Bye.

02:57:58.680 --> 02:58:01.960
I should. Oh, I should. Damn it. I shouldn't hit the hang up button. Cause I should have

02:58:01.960 --> 02:58:06.680
said something to him about introducing me to fireball. That's that's something I'm always

02:58:06.680 --> 02:58:11.640
going to associate Brad with in our relationship with OLRs, how he introduced me to fireball

02:58:11.640 --> 02:58:15.000
by getting us a big bottle of it here. But anyway, we got another call. So let's get to

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:18.520
it higher on orange songs radio. Who's this? Yeah. What's up? This guy, Judo. Hey guys, you know,

02:58:18.520 --> 02:58:23.080
what's up my friend. Not much. First off happy 15th. Um, I think I've been listening to you

02:58:23.080 --> 02:58:28.360
guys for maybe 10 years. Thank you. Holy shit. Wow. Yeah. I know it's been a while,

02:58:28.360 --> 02:58:33.240
but damn, it's another to hear it. Thank you. Yeah. I think I first found you guys in, uh,

02:58:33.240 --> 02:58:39.560
2007. I think I was like, um, I was feeling, uh, nostalgic for, uh, the G four network. Oh,

02:58:39.560 --> 02:58:45.800
sure. I looked up Scott. Sure. Finding Scott. I found out all games radio and that led me to,

02:58:45.800 --> 02:58:49.160
uh, Bobby Blackwell for you guys. And I've been listening to her ever since. So no,

02:58:49.160 --> 02:58:52.520
that all games partnership was a win-win for all of us, you know, and not like I,

02:58:52.520 --> 02:58:56.360
like I said earlier in the show, I know things have shifted around, you know,

02:58:56.360 --> 02:59:00.760
five years ago when we, we, we moved over to VOG network and did our own thing. But,

02:59:00.760 --> 02:59:05.080
um, I think our partnership with all games was, was so good for both of us. You know,

02:59:05.080 --> 02:59:08.040
we had an audience, we brought to them, they had an audience they brought to us and it was

02:59:08.920 --> 02:59:13.480
some fantastic years. Yeah. And what you, what you guys brought to all games was great as well,

02:59:13.480 --> 02:59:18.840
because like not to, uh, not to knock anyone who, who chooses not to do their show live,

02:59:19.560 --> 02:59:22.600
you know, like, you know, I know that there's like special situations where, you know,

02:59:22.600 --> 02:59:26.200
somebody just can't sit there for like two, three hours and do a live show. Sure. But what

02:59:26.200 --> 02:59:30.200
I really appreciated about your show was that you were, you guys were alive because I was only

02:59:30.200 --> 02:59:35.720
looking for live shows to listen to, you know? I gotcha. I gotcha. That's what you guys brought

02:59:35.720 --> 02:59:39.160
to network. But, uh, real quickly, I just wanted to point out to you guys, you guys,

02:59:39.160 --> 02:59:44.760
uh, spoke earlier about the, uh, PlayStation, not playing nice with the other systems and, uh,

02:59:44.760 --> 02:59:48.520
Bobby Blackwell, he made a great point on his show. I hope I'm not stealing this thunder. I don't

02:59:48.520 --> 02:59:52.520
know if he's going to call in. It's our birthday. You can steal a little thunder. It's our

02:59:52.520 --> 02:59:57.720
birthday. You can steal a little thunder. Well, he mentioned that maybe Sony doesn't want to play

02:59:57.720 --> 03:00:02.360
is because you would, you would need an Xbox live account to do that in Minecraft stuff. Not,

03:00:02.360 --> 03:00:07.160
not necessarily with Rocket League or any other games, but with Minecraft, you would need to be

03:00:07.160 --> 03:00:12.280
connected to Xbox live. Do you need that? Do you need that on, but like, I know when I play my

03:00:12.280 --> 03:00:16.120
PlayStation version of Minecraft now and I'm online, I don't need that, but that's, that's

03:00:16.120 --> 03:00:20.440
just because to connect to the other side of it, because it is Minecraft, you would,

03:00:20.440 --> 03:00:24.120
that would be the universal place. Whereas, okay, I guess I can kind of see where this is going

03:00:24.120 --> 03:00:28.920
because like on, um, when it was Final Fantasy 11, everything was through play online, but ironic

03:00:28.920 --> 03:00:33.640
because play online was a Sony venture. And that did, it was like half Sony and that did show up

03:00:33.640 --> 03:00:40.200
on 360. However, it was a different time in games. Microsoft was desperate to have to partner with

03:00:40.200 --> 03:00:43.960
Square Enix. So they let them get away with merch. So it was a different time. Uh, and I

03:00:43.960 --> 03:00:46.520
think that's important for people to remember when we talk about this whole, well, they've

03:00:46.520 --> 03:00:50.200
done it before. Why don't they, it was just a very, very different time for Microsoft.

03:00:50.200 --> 03:00:55.560
Um, so yeah, I mean, and even through Final Fantasy 14, you're logging in through the,

03:00:55.560 --> 03:00:59.640
the play, uh, it's not play online, but it's like a different Square Enix gateway that you're

03:00:59.640 --> 03:01:04.520
logging in through. So I kind of get it in that regard that if Xbox live is to be that gateway,

03:01:05.880 --> 03:01:09.880
Sony might have some reservations with that. Yeah. You know, you don't want to catch those,

03:01:09.880 --> 03:01:14.520
those, uh, Microsoft germs. Yeah. So yeah, it makes sense. It is a little weird is the word.

03:01:14.520 --> 03:01:18.360
No, I think Bobby has some good insight there, but hopefully, hopefully they find a way to,

03:01:18.360 --> 03:01:22.520
to work around it or something, or maybe just connect to Xbox live as a guest or like some

03:01:22.520 --> 03:01:27.160
of the mobile games or even like websites too, where you can log in, you know, you can log and

03:01:27.160 --> 03:01:33.000
say like through Minecraft or something.com, but log in with your Xbox live login or log in with

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:37.560
your Nintendo network login or something like that, you know, where they have multiple options.

03:01:37.560 --> 03:01:44.360
My worry though, is are they requiring Xbox live gold to play cross play with? Oh, that would suck

03:01:44.360 --> 03:01:51.160
because you have to log in the live. Maybe if you're on Microsoft. Yes. But if you're on a

03:01:51.160 --> 03:01:55.720
tablet, tablets don't fucking have anything like that. Or are you saying that because you'd be

03:01:55.720 --> 03:02:03.240
logging with my Xbox live, you would have to have it. I don't know. Well, I know, I know I have that.

03:02:03.720 --> 03:02:07.400
I have the tablet version of Minecraft and you have to, uh, they have that stupid, uh,

03:02:07.400 --> 03:02:11.800
what is it realms or some crap? Yeah. They gotta be a part of it. That's how,

03:02:11.800 --> 03:02:16.920
that's how you're playing cross platform anyways, realms. I think you're all gonna be logging into

03:02:16.920 --> 03:02:25.000
the servers. We'll see what happens. Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna let you guys go before I leave. I just

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:31.080
want to say, uh, hopefully that'll allow, uh, people from Microsoft to, uh, play rocket league

03:02:31.080 --> 03:02:35.720
because, uh, I came to play video games and, uh, kick some Microsoft fan boy ass. So

03:02:36.840 --> 03:02:41.240
bring it on, bring it on. All right. Take care of my friend. All right. Later. Bye.

03:02:42.120 --> 03:02:47.160
All right. Uh, I, Hey, look, I plan on taking every call, so let's get to it. Hi,

03:02:47.160 --> 03:02:52.040
you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? What's going on, everybody? Hey, Rama, how you doing?

03:02:52.040 --> 03:02:58.040
I'm doing good. How about y'all? Good. I fucking love that shirt. He's got a, it's Rama express,

03:02:58.040 --> 03:03:02.600
but it's like Panda express the little, I know you guys anyway. That's great. What's up, buddy?

03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:08.520
It says at the bottom curse Chinese Springs, but, um, I think y'all, y'all know what time it is.

03:03:08.520 --> 03:03:14.280
Oh, yes I do. Yes I do. That's right. Holding up a bottle of nickelau vodka.

03:03:14.920 --> 03:03:17.800
Yes, sir. That's right. Pouring one out. Let's do it.

03:03:18.360 --> 03:03:22.840
As I'm pouring these three, Rob, like I say, you spoke some real truth and some real words

03:03:22.840 --> 03:03:28.760
about podcasting. You don't know. I have gotten into arguments with people. We're podcasting,

03:03:28.760 --> 03:03:35.160
what you got to do and so forth. And as I said in the chat room, when I wake up one day and say,

03:03:36.200 --> 03:03:41.080
this ain't fun, no more. And my jam session is going to wrap it up. Simple as that.

03:03:41.640 --> 03:03:45.960
I think it's the same thing for, I think that would, that would also apply here at OLR.

03:03:45.960 --> 03:03:49.720
I mean, there may be, there may be life things, you know, we, we had it, everybody knows we had

03:03:49.720 --> 03:03:55.800
a scare seven or eight years ago where Jamie was very likely going to move far away. And that was

03:03:55.800 --> 03:03:59.800
scary because it was like, are we going to be able to keep doing OLR? I mean, I fought against it.

03:03:59.800 --> 03:04:03.720
Yeah. And you know, obviously here we are, we're still doing this, celebrating 15 years. So I

03:04:03.720 --> 03:04:09.160
didn't pan out, but it, it may happen someday. Life takes us to weird fucking places. So you

03:04:09.160 --> 03:04:14.120
never know. Well, Rob, I do remember the first time I came up to find him that you did say,

03:04:14.120 --> 03:04:18.040
uh, when Loki was going to have his first born, y'all was going to wrap the show up. And as you

03:04:18.040 --> 03:04:22.360
can see, it's still going. Did I, that seems so ridiculous that I said that now.

03:04:24.280 --> 03:04:28.360
Well, and I can say this cause we're old. I was young and stupid then.

03:04:29.480 --> 03:04:33.240
Aren't we all stupid and I'm old and stupid now.

03:04:36.840 --> 03:04:43.400
Oh, there's one shot down. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Chug Chug. There's two.

03:04:43.400 --> 03:04:49.080
I'm sorry. This is horrible radio, but I'm loving it. I'm watching the video.

03:04:49.880 --> 03:04:55.960
This goes along and say, get over stupid. I'm up here doing shots in my brand new gaming chair.

03:04:55.960 --> 03:04:59.880
Booze is going all over the place. Marco is going to scream at me,

03:04:59.880 --> 03:05:03.640
scream at me for spilling the booze. And I don't give a fuck. Drink that shot.

03:05:05.320 --> 03:05:06.520
There it is. Number three.

03:05:06.520 --> 03:05:19.160
Yes, sir. Let me finish the call with this. Here's to you. Here's to me. The best of friends

03:05:19.160 --> 03:05:25.800
will ever be if we should ever happen to disagree. Well, fuck you. And here's to me.

03:05:26.920 --> 03:05:30.680
I I'm giving you, I'm giving you a high five right up against the Misty can verify. I got

03:05:30.680 --> 03:05:35.080
you a high five right there up against the monitor right now. Thank you, my friend.

03:05:36.760 --> 03:05:43.720
I hope to see you soon. Rama see me in October. I know. I know. I got to figure out. I still

03:05:43.720 --> 03:05:46.360
don't have the official invite to said way, but we'll figure all that out.

03:05:47.560 --> 03:05:52.120
Oh, we will. Cause Maka will be coming up to record us old farts playing DDR.

03:05:52.120 --> 03:05:58.200
Can't wait. All right. All right. My friend. I'm gonna let you go. Yeah. Stay fabulous. Thank you.

03:05:58.200 --> 03:06:04.440
You too. Stay fabulous. All right. Bye. Playing DDR makes me tempted to somehow tag along.

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:10.520
You get to take a train on out there. All right. We got one more coming on. Let's see.

03:06:11.160 --> 03:06:15.240
Hello. Hello. Oh, it's connecting. It's loading. I don't know if you can hear me higher on orange

03:06:15.240 --> 03:06:22.840
launch radio. Who's this? Hey, Hey, what's up my friend. Oh, hi. You know, just wanted to call in

03:06:22.840 --> 03:06:30.920
for that 15th anniversary. I, I can think of no, no better way to do this because I don't know if

03:06:30.920 --> 03:06:35.480
you are the last caller tonight. I'll see if anything else pops in, but I know you were there

03:06:35.480 --> 03:06:41.320
episode one, dark Tetsuya. And there's only about 11 other people that can say that. So I, I

03:06:41.320 --> 03:06:47.160
appreciate your support tremendously over the years for sure. Well, what's on your mind?

03:06:48.360 --> 03:06:51.640
I don't know. I suppose I could talk Nintendo a little bit. Go for it.

03:06:53.480 --> 03:06:58.360
Yeah. I think I'm really excited for some of the games they got coming out like that Mario Odyssey.

03:06:58.680 --> 03:07:01.640
Yeah. Hell yeah. When he threw that hat at the T-Rex.

03:07:02.280 --> 03:07:05.880
Yeah. That's crazy. And I love that theme song. That is.

03:07:07.080 --> 03:07:13.080
Oh yeah. That's great. And I love that they tied it to Pauline. Who's kind of in some ways is kind

03:07:13.080 --> 03:07:18.200
of forgotten in the Mario verse. Did you see all the costumes, all the costumes tie back to like

03:07:18.200 --> 03:07:23.000
obscure costumes that were games. Yeah, no, it's great. It's great. Like there's just so many

03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:28.120
obscure references that like Nintendo fanboys just are fucking eaten up on a silver fucking platter,

03:07:28.120 --> 03:07:36.120
just like they did the Wii U. And it's great. You know, I, okay. You remember back when, uh,

03:07:36.120 --> 03:07:42.120
Jimmy Fallon had Reggie and Shigeru on? Yes. When we were like, Oh, are they trying to hide the

03:07:42.120 --> 03:07:48.120
loading? Yes. I remember that. I do. Cause we looked like assholes. Yeah. So Miyamoto

03:07:48.120 --> 03:07:55.720
was wearing this t-shirt of Mario in a samurai costume. Oh, get out. So do you think even all

03:07:55.720 --> 03:08:00.920
the way back then he was fucking teasing something in Mario Odyssey? Possibly. Yeah. That's what I

03:08:00.920 --> 03:08:07.080
think. Oh my God. I didn't even think about that, but there's gifts everywhere where you

03:08:07.080 --> 03:08:10.920
could see that. Cause everybody took that thumbs down into the thumbs up thing and then going

03:08:10.920 --> 03:08:16.920
and reversing it and all that stuff. I give is everywhere. Yeah. That's hilarious. Well, yeah,

03:08:16.920 --> 03:08:20.920
I'm definitely looking forward to Mario Odyssey act. Efton chat says, then again, people made a

03:08:20.920 --> 03:08:25.560
fuzz about Mexican Mario ugh. Good thing. My people actually didn't find that offensive at all.

03:08:25.560 --> 03:08:31.320
Well, it's the internet. Someone's going to be offended about something. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

03:08:31.320 --> 03:08:34.760
Dr. C, anything else you want to get out or share with our listeners tonight before we let you go?

03:08:35.800 --> 03:08:42.120
No, I figure I'll send you guys my regards on behalf of a gamer girl. I appreciate that. And

03:08:42.120 --> 03:08:48.680
I hope she's doing well. Let me ask this question to end on tonight. Dr. C, just let's pretend

03:08:48.680 --> 03:08:51.560
nobody else is listening right now. And it's just us having a conversation. Cause I have a

03:08:51.560 --> 03:08:56.440
serious question to ask you. Has it gotten better since episode one? No.

03:08:59.880 --> 03:09:02.200
Feel good. Then that means we're doing something right.

03:09:04.440 --> 03:09:07.960
All right. Take care of my friend. I'm gonna let you go to try and squeeze in more calls.

03:09:07.960 --> 03:09:13.640
You too. I'll talk to you later. All right. Bye. Yeah. All right. Uh, orange launch radio,

03:09:13.640 --> 03:09:17.400
all one word on Skype. I think that was all the calls I see popping up,

03:09:17.400 --> 03:09:21.800
but I'm in a good mood tonight. So I'll, I'll pretty much take all the calls till everybody's

03:09:21.800 --> 03:09:28.280
done, but thank you so much for the calls that we've received so far. Um, really appreciate it.

03:09:28.280 --> 03:09:33.160
Can feel the love tonight on our 15th anniversary. Let me check real quick with Loki as I usually do

03:09:33.160 --> 03:09:36.680
at this point in the show while we see if any other calls pop on. Do we have any last minute

03:09:36.680 --> 03:09:41.800
stories? No, no, no. All right. I guess, I guess we did cover most everything anyway.

03:09:41.800 --> 03:09:46.840
And it is about nine 30. So at this point, I think no as much as orange lounge, I'll have to

03:09:46.840 --> 03:09:52.520
roll that over to episode 700 because we are at nine 30. It is getting late and you know,

03:09:52.520 --> 03:09:57.880
we do have to work tomorrow and fortunately, and Misty's got a train to catch. So we do have to

03:09:57.880 --> 03:10:02.680
wrap up tonight, but, uh, I want to thank you guys so much again for your support. And, um,

03:10:02.680 --> 03:10:07.240
yeah, I'm not gonna keep elaborating cause I will make myself cry and I'm not here to

03:10:07.240 --> 03:10:12.520
do that tonight. So I'm just going to say just a big general. Thank you so much for

03:10:12.840 --> 03:10:17.400
all of it for all of this. We're not crying. You're crying. That's right. We're not crying.

03:10:17.400 --> 03:10:21.480
You're crying. Um, I'm crying because it's going to be while before I see Misty again,

03:10:21.480 --> 03:10:25.880
but I want to thank you for being here, Misty and celebrating our 15th anniversary with us.

03:10:25.880 --> 03:10:30.200
And plus your support over the years, you've been, you know, I know, I know you haven't been there

03:10:30.200 --> 03:10:35.960
since episode one, like dark Tetsuya, but dammit, you might as well have been, I think if you knew

03:10:35.960 --> 03:10:40.600
about it, then you probably would have been. So I really appreciate that probably. Well,

03:10:41.160 --> 03:10:45.160
I did get in before a hundred, so I'm still pretty damn good. Yeah. Still to say you were

03:10:45.160 --> 03:10:49.720
OLR in the double digits, it's still pretty good. Uh, in the pre podcast days, even, I mean,

03:10:49.720 --> 03:10:54.920
the, the highest we ever got in the pre podcast days was we did have an episode where a hundred

03:10:54.920 --> 03:10:58.920
people were listening and it was because we had that Akira Yomoka track from DDR. That was the

03:10:58.920 --> 03:11:05.320
night that that was actually in some ways. And I think we have listener, live listener caps. We

03:11:05.320 --> 03:11:09.240
had live listener caps and we hit the cap on life 365 that night with that. And that was a whole

03:11:09.240 --> 03:11:14.520
nother reason why we had to change our plan, but, um, just a walk down memory lane real quick

03:11:14.520 --> 03:11:19.640
that night in some ways was really transformative for the show because there was people that stuck

03:11:19.640 --> 03:11:26.520
around for that. And then there was more that came after that. Um, there was the, um, DDR ultra

03:11:26.520 --> 03:11:33.320
mix for previews that we got to do here. I don't think it was, yeah, it was, it was remixed or

03:11:33.320 --> 03:11:38.840
so, but I remember ultra mix for specifically, um, you know, that the fact that we had people

03:11:38.840 --> 03:11:43.480
at Konami, namely still wind, who's no longer with us as we've talked about a few years ago

03:11:43.480 --> 03:11:50.520
when he passed, um, had faith in our show to be able to do that. And just that got me a vivid foot

03:11:50.520 --> 03:11:56.440
on DDR freak. And as a long time DDR fan, I can't tell you what that means. I really vouched for

03:11:56.440 --> 03:12:00.440
you. I know that's, yeah, you were you, well, you, you were a moderator. You were, you were,

03:12:00.440 --> 03:12:05.720
I know it was funny. It was funny. I can still log into DDR freak forums.

03:12:05.720 --> 03:12:10.120
Do you know what's funny is Jason tonight was asking me a question for his intro

03:12:10.120 --> 03:12:13.880
and I didn't know the answer. And do you know where he found the answer? DDR freak. He went

03:12:13.880 --> 03:12:19.800
into the archives because he, this show started in June of 2002. So he was able to look up what,

03:12:19.800 --> 03:12:23.800
what was the DDR freak headline in June of 2002. So I just thought that was hilarious and awesome

03:12:23.800 --> 03:12:29.080
at the same time. So anyway, Misty, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to tangent off of your goodbye,

03:12:29.080 --> 03:12:35.400
but you should be fucking used to tangents by now. Well, yeah. All right. Well, uh, Misty,

03:12:35.400 --> 03:12:41.000
anything you want to say to our listeners before we sign off tonight? With the fuckery that's going

03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:46.120
on with my train out of town, I'm, I'm glad I decided to sign up for the prepaid adult drink

03:12:46.120 --> 03:12:52.920
option on the connect on the flight I'm connecting to. Amen. Amen. I hope I'm hoping to get a drink

03:12:52.920 --> 03:12:58.920
on my flight to Chicago as well. So it'll be, it'll be a lot of fun. All right. Well, here it

03:12:58.920 --> 03:13:02.360
is. You know, I feel like we're going to be celebrating a landmark again in nine weeks when

03:13:02.360 --> 03:13:05.800
we hit 700 episodes and maybe, I don't know, maybe we'll be able to throw something together for

03:13:05.800 --> 03:13:09.640
that. That's gonna be the week before labor day, but for now, you know, again, 15 years,

03:13:09.640 --> 03:13:13.880
it's a long fucking time. Um, Loki, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

03:13:14.520 --> 03:13:22.200
Um, I'm not playing the Garfield game cause I already uninstalled it because it was breaking

03:13:22.200 --> 03:13:26.920
our pact, man. It's crap. It's so much crap, but you got to play it just to try it. So you can say,

03:13:26.920 --> 03:13:31.640
wow, this is crap. I will. I will probably won't last long on my phone either because of the forced

03:13:31.640 --> 03:13:38.040
AR. World number one on Garfield. Hot and cold in your house. You have to walk around your AR

03:13:38.040 --> 03:13:43.720
and like find some treasure shit. No, I'm not doing that. Why is the treasure in the litter box?

03:13:43.720 --> 03:13:47.720
Because litter box is the meme. You're in my heart.

03:13:50.760 --> 03:13:56.360
I peed you a heart. I almost don't want you to have a final thought tonight, but I suppose

03:13:56.360 --> 03:14:03.560
with the 15th birthday I'm legally obligated to. So hearts, dark Sakura. Well, apart from the

03:14:03.560 --> 03:14:11.480
reject false icons, especially in government, um, if you can't be good, be good at it. Amen.

03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:16.200
Thanks as always for your support, everybody. I say it every week. If you enjoyed what you

03:14:16.200 --> 03:14:19.800
heard here at orange launch radio, blah, blah, blah, tell a friend, blah, blah, blah,

03:14:19.800 --> 03:14:25.160
review on iTunes, but they really do go an awful long way and just thanks for your support. It

03:14:25.160 --> 03:14:30.760
means the world. I don't know what my Sunday nights would look like without orange launch radio.

03:14:31.400 --> 03:14:38.920
Um, but I'm, I'm just, I'm, I'm happy it's here and I'm happy it exists and I'm happy you all

03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:49.480
give a fuck. I really am. Oh, I thought you were laughing at me. The final thought flamethrowers

03:14:49.480 --> 03:14:54.520
and video games are either really good or really bad, but usually good, usually good.

03:14:55.640 --> 03:15:00.040
Have fun playing video games. You guys we'll see you next time here at orange launch radio.

03:15:00.040 --> 03:15:03.880
We'll see you in two weeks. Remember no show next week. So you got to make this one last hearts,

03:15:03.880 --> 03:15:10.840
not farts. We'll see you for year 16. Bye everybody. You've been listening to orange
