0	27600	Orange Lounge Radio Here's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie and Loki 15 years ago, a San Diego teen took exception to graphic imagery in DDR Solo 2000 and 15 years later, Orange Lounge Radio Episode 691 airs. Thank you for joining us on this journey and stay tuned as it continues right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27720	30200	Orange Lounge Radio
32080	56960	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It's Orange Lounge Radio live tonight. Episode number 691 for this June 18 of 2017. My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as she has for the past 15 years, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.
57000	58480	I'm so congenial, Rob.
59200	59800	Are you?
60040	60600	Yes.
60640	66120	No, you're just fan favorite. You probably are the fan favorite of the show, actually.
66560	69880	No, you know what? It's Tech Master Loki. He's the fan favorite. Hi, Loki.
69960	70520	Hello.
70560	71160	How are you?
71200	73480	Speaking of fan, it's pretty hot in here.
73480	83760	It is. I know. We have the fan going. It's, it's, uh, it's why I had all the lights off before OLR, but it's getting hot with all these, all of us in studio and so forth. So the good news is it should cool down.
83760	85240	At least it's not in the garage.
85480	93600	It isn't. No, this show was in the garage at one point. It was an insulated garage, so it was supposed to be a little better. It was in the colder months. It was probably a lot better.
93640	94000	Yeah.
94000	112720	And in the warmer months, it was pretty, uh, it was, it was something. So anyway, we're here. We're joined with you guys over at our chat room over at vognetwork.com, The Voice of Geeks Network, where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show live.vognetwork.com.
112720	128400	If you want to join us in our chat room where folks are being very nice and saying a lot of nice things about the show and the fact that we're turning 15 years old tonight. That's right. Our very first episode, I guess we're a little bit early. Our first episode was June 23rd of 2002.
128400	137920	But you know what? Close enough. Close enough, dammit. Especially with the fact that, you know, I'm going out of town this upcoming weekend. So it had to be tonight or it would be really late. So close enough.
138480	162160	15 year celebration here. And, um, you know, right off the bat, just, you know, thanks you guys for being here, whether you've been here for 15 minutes. This is your first OLR episode. Interesting, interesting night you picked to join OLR. But whether you're here for 15 minutes or 15 years, thank you for being a part of it. You know, I don't, I don't know if we would have made it this long without a lot of the encouragement that you guys have brought us over the years.
162720	174560	Speaking of encouragement and fans and so forth, we're joined here in studio tonight by one of our longtime listeners. And it's a pleasure to have her here all the way from St. Louis. Say hello, everybody to Misty here in studio.
175120	179680	I now have four different games registered to my emus card. It is it's Rob's fault.
180320	200000	That's right. Traveling around playing music games, which is how this show all started, right? And that's how you found this show was because of your love of music games, right? Yep. That's right. Any because you know, I barely remember what happened last week on this show, Misty. Is there any particular memory over the 15 years of the show that you remember like a moment that was like one of your favorites?
200000	206240	Not offhand that I haven't mentioned in the past, like episode 69.
206240	229920	Yes, there was episode 69 was a little bit infamous. For those that weren't here, we played karaoke revolution live on because we, if you think this show is a mess now, you should see some of the early episodes. And they're out there, by the way, on the internet. If you know where to look. And if you don't know where to look, ask a guy named dark Tetsuya, who's who's wearing a trench coat around the corner, he'll sell you some old for free some old OLR episodes that are posted around up there.
229920	259680	And I don't know if episode 69 is in the archive, but I imagine it has to be. And we were playing karaoke revolution live and Loki turned in one of the greatest renditions of all time to play the game. But you did. And that's what made it funny. That's what made it funny. So, all right. And some other folks in chat very nice Dungeon Buster saying yay, here's to another 15. Bobby Blackwell says Rob thinks DT gives away old episodes for free. That's cute. You're adorable. You have almost misty don't you have almost like every episode?
259680	269920	I remember that one of the times you were here, you like rated all my drives. And I think you like stole every mp3 I had of Oh my gosh, she can do you wear that around your neck?
271040	283680	Not usually. I just took advantage of the fact that I got a new computer recently to also make sure I had a good portable backup copy that also kind of creeps me out that like the 15 year history of this show fits on a fucking thumb drive.
283680	286680	Well, they have ginormous amounts of
286680	313600	I know I know they do. It's just it's just crazy, crazy for me. So anyway, um, I again, I you know, I'm not to get too sappy here. And I know we didn't we didn't plan like fireworks and stuff because we have E3 to get to I mean, with this all falls during E3 week, we've got to talk about what's going on a gaming because that's what we're here to do. And we didn't plan a lot of fireworks for tonight. Because you know, it's, I don't after celebrating five years, then 10 years, then 600.
313600	343160	Then 500. It's kind of like you kind of go, well, what's there left to do, but do what people tune in every week to hear. So I know we don't have a lot of fanfare tonight. But you know, just again, I just I just want to say a big thank you from for me, not just to my co host. I mean, I think I said this in a Facebook post earlier on social media, but not everybody could do one thing over and over and over again every week for 15 years. That takes an extraordinary amount of discipline. And that's not something I
343160	373080	certainly by any means could take sole credit for. I mean, Dark Soccer and Loki have been committed to this from the very beginning Loki when he wasn't even invited in the very beginning. But obviously, we've retconned him back to a full host since Episode One. But yeah, I mean, thank you guys for for being here every week, because truly, this show would not have lasted without that sort of discipline that it takes from everybody, not just one of us. So but also, you know, again, thanks to listeners for making this possible. I don't want to give
373080	403040	too many specific thank yous because I'm always afraid that I'm going to leave somebody out. So I'm just going to give a very, very, very broad thanks. But I do want to just call out just a couple few things that I think have to be called out for like this would not have happened if if not for these folks. And then if Dark Soccer or Loki want to add anything, by all means, but I would say we have to of course, say thank you to Travis Donovan from Understation Live, mostly because I would get an Instagram if I didn't call him out. No, just kidding. But the fact that Travis
403040	423080	really opened my eyes and Jamie's eyes from being the longtime guest host she was on that show, to the fact that this was even possible. Like I didn't even know that this was an outlet until Travis kind of opened that door for me. So for that, I'm incredibly thankful, even though I know he's very bitter, the show is still going. I say that would love and I'm hoping he does come back.
423080	429560	I function on the tears of the bitter tears of those who would stand against me. So I don't think Travis stands against them.
429560	433880	No, Travis doesn't. But there have been some some mouthy dudes out there.
433880	435000	Yeah, there have.
435000	435560	Guess what?
435560	437960	Has anything ever been mansplained to you, Dark Soccer?
437960	445480	Oh, all the fucking time. But you know what? I have to say to all of them in a glorious, operatic voice. Fuck you.
446440	468840	So one of my good friends, I consider him a good friend. He was on a TV show here called Big Brother like seven years ago. And I, he was not portrayed very well on the show. He was a bit of a villain on the show. And I stole this saying from him and I love it. And Dark Soccer, I know, I know this applies to you too. Haters are my motivators.
468840	470600	I can dig with that.
470680	482520	I think that's something I've took from his that's Ronnie from season 11. If anybody watches that show, he gave me that phrase once and I've held on to that for a long time, especially especially in the past few years.
482520	488920	But trust me, I drink cup pools of salty tears on a daily basis. And baby, they ain't mine.
490760	495800	I also have to say thank you. This is so important. You guys know him as the voiceover guy here on the show.
495800	506280	But Jason, VX JasonXV, like literally this show would not have a place to be if it wasn't for Jason. Jason has been the master of the technical side of things.
506280	524920	And ensuring that I technically, I don't think he was here in the very, very, very beginning, but he came on like pretty quick and to help us out and to have a website to even have this and our vast weighty MP3 library that bared the weight of when iTunes launched podcasting for the very first time.
524920	537080	And we were one of the video game shows on it back when there were only like 20 video game shows on iTunes, if you can even remember such a day at this point. Jason has made sure that this site ran through all of it, all of it.
537080	547800	And anytime I've ever had a concern, even if I haven't taken a minute to ask Jason, like, you know, like, how are things, you know, in the past few months, but I'm like, Jason, the website's broken.
548760	564840	Like, he's on it, and he fixes it. So like, I really can't stress that enough that you guys don't hear him all the time, although there was a period of time, he was coming to this show a lot because his workout I'm out here, but I really can't stress enough that like this show, you wouldn't even fucking hear it if it wasn't for Jason. So that is so important.
564840	592440	And from a technical perspective, also deep man, I have to also certainly give him a nod because that even though the website, our main websites a little bit old, it is all because, you know, deep man had a huge hand of the design of that. And we still use that to this day. So for that, we're thankful. And then probably the only other like big, big thank you I have to give here at the top is, of course, to Bobby Blackwolf, who is, you know, the voice you hear at vogue network has been a business partner in vogue network has
593320	619760	saved this show from going off the air when we had to leave live 365 because the fees were getting too out of control, and really brokered the deal between us and all games radio, which was a very important period in the history of this show. And I know, you know, I know, we ended up making a decision to leave that network to do what we're doing at vogue network, but I have nothing but great things to say about all games and our years there and their hopeful continued success over there.
620320	646960	And you know, we are on E3 week. And seriously, and I say this all the time, the best E3 ever was that year when like all the all games broadcasters were there. And there was that frickin arena. And you remember that in Santa Monica, we were walking and it was just like it was off the hook. And that was stuff that our relationship with all games provided us over those years. So that's very important. So a big thank you. Again, I don't want to leave anybody out. So I'm sure I'm leaving millions of people out with this.
646960	651480	I'd like to those are just some of the most important ones. My drag mother, the Virgin de Guadalupe.
656080	659480	Loki, Dark Soccer, anything that I forgot that are worth saying?
659960	665200	I'd like to thank the members of the the gay frat house that I slept in during episode three.
665360	667840	That was the she's not even kidding. She's not even kidding whatsoever.
667840	673160	I slept in the Harry Potter room of the gay frat house, San Diego. And that was like what episode three?
673800	678360	It was it was it was early on. It was early on. Speaking of all games I just noticed in chat over
678360	684040	Derek H just joined us our old pal from all games says congrats to OLR for making it to a place few
684040	688600	shows could even dream of. Thank you, Derek. That means an awful lot. Although I must feel in a way
688600	694200	that I said Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice. But no all in God. It's it's fantastic to see you
694200	699080	here, Derek. Thank you so much. Look at some other comments and chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
699080	703320	Ragenator says I remember the OLR's first live episode on all games was the first one that I was
703320	709800	able to listen to live. That is awesome. Come on Noel Gustin chat says Q's wind beneath my wings.
709800	715080	No, no, we're not gonna go we're not gonna go that cheesy. But if we were to sing it, Loki would sing
715080	720840	it just just so we're clear. I'm just kidding. But don't we want to sound half decent? True.
721240	727320	I would probably be stuck with it. Did you ever know I fucking hate you?
729560	738040	I think that was like episode 69 verse, you know, level of effort. Now that bar is way down there.
738760	742680	It's like it's like Nintendo and online down there. Wait, we had a bar?
744120	746760	There was a bar on the show? All right, there was a bar on the show.
746760	754440	All right, anyway, let's let's move on. I will have the phone lines open in part B,
754440	758280	we actually cut a few stories out later in the show, I want to be able to take plenty of phone
758280	763560	calls and talk more about memories over 15 years. Well, let me actually before we before we go into
763560	767480	E3 chat, I think this is important thing to talk about when we're talking about 15 years of OLR
767480	771560	and realize that I'm putting my co host and Misty on the spot if she wants to join in.
771560	775160	And you guys in our chat as well over at live.vognetwork.com. We've been doing this
775160	780680	since 2002. That's a very long time. I know I asked a similar question to this when we celebrated
780680	785160	10 years of OLR. But I'm curious if anybody's answers may have shifted or changed based on
785160	791640	our perspective now versus what it would have been in 2012. In 15 years of observing video games and
791640	796840	gaming culture, what do you think has had the biggest change on video games as we know it?
797640	801800	What do you think has been the most important thing in our industry in 15 years?
801800	805160	Dr. Sakura? The internet.
805160	808440	The internet. The internet was here 15 years ago, though, right?
808440	815080	But social media has more taken off over the course of the last 15 years. And as we've seen,
815080	824280	you know, having a direct line to game developers to people who, you know, even upper management
824280	829080	at some of these games and having interaction with them. It's actually I think changed a lot
829080	833720	of the dynamic with how people, with how they get feedback from fans, especially now adding
833720	839720	Kickstarter to everything. So I'd more put it for social media and the social aspect of it.
839720	842840	You're piggybacking on that a little bit, if you don't mind. The social
842840	847000	kind of aspect to me kind of extends into when we look at things like Twitch TV
847560	852360	and what YouTube and Mixer and all that's been bringing to the table too is a very social element.
852360	856360	It might not be social media and the same Facebook and Twitter type sense,
856360	860280	but definitely that has been transformative as well. Absolutely.
860280	864600	So good answer. Loki, anything you would say over 15 years?
864600	868840	Yeah, the constant greed from publishers and developers, mostly publishers.
869800	870600	What do you mean by that?
871160	876120	Because they've fucked up things with online passes. They've fucked up things with
876120	881400	microtransactions. They've fucked up things with, hey, we think we're going to drive this
881400	885000	franchise into the ground because it needs a million releases so that we can, you know,
885000	889160	make our investors happy. So yes, publishers.
889160	891080	I see. So publishers ruining everything.
891080	891640	Yes.
891640	897800	Okay. Actually, that's not a bad answer. My answer would be probably simply Xbox Live
898520	903880	and not solely necessarily Xbox Live, but I guess it's kind of just a more
903880	908520	narrow version of what Jamie really said, because honestly, I kind of go along with
908520	914840	Jamie's answer as well, but I feel like Xbox Live is really the thing that ironically
915080	919480	killed the environment where this show started. You know, if you recall,
919480	922200	I've told this story a million times, but I'll tell it one more time.
922200	927320	OLR started because we all played an arcade game together that we had a lot of fun playing
927320	931560	and that really had a community. So we all got together every week and we played DDR
931560	935880	and then we would go out to eat. DDR followed by mozzarella sticks,
935880	938840	because not that things made sense 15 years ago, but they did.
939560	941960	You know, we would go play DDR, then we would go eat and we would sit around.
942360	946680	Back then we were doing enough cardio to burn that stuff up. That was no big deal.
946680	951640	Now it's just mozzarella sticks. But all that joking aside, I mean,
951640	957080	I feel like Xbox Live and that whole gaming through all of that kind of murdered the arcades
957080	964120	for a good long time. And only just now are we starting to see some of that come back through,
964120	969320	you know, round one and some of these things that we have a little more locally where the arcade
969320	974360	scene is kind of building again. And a lot of that is because of the ideas that they're taking
974360	979240	from mobile gaming, which would definitely be in my top five. One of the big things that have
979240	984920	happened in the past 15 years are the fact that everybody is a fucking gamer now because cell
984920	990760	phones and things like Farmville and Bejeweled that even, you know, your parents play and all
990760	997800	that stuff. So, yeah, but I think Xbox Live in particular really did a lot of damage to the
997800	1003160	arcade scene. I mean, but not that that's necessarily a bad thing. It's just an evolution,
1003160	1011560	but it was certainly transformative to where we are now. Going in chat over at live.vognetwork.com
1011560	1016280	Dartetsuya in chat says, I agree with Loki. That all but killed everything that wasn't Guitar Hero.
1016280	1019960	I never got to play DJ Hero, but it looked like a fun game. So, it would have been cool to see
1019960	1025240	a reboot of that or something. Yyr says, definitely the internet changed gaming
1025240	1030280	directly, online play and indirectly, social media, community streaming, hate speech,
1030280	1036520	you name it. Rage Nator says, I miss arcades, sniff. Free Kill Zero in chat pointing out,
1036520	1041560	Dreamcast had online gaming, yes, but Xbox Live integrated voice chat as part of the service.
1041560	1046280	Absolutely. It kind of pushed it to the next level. And I think even a lot of us look back
1046280	1049560	at the Dreamcast and go, it was a system that was ahead of its time in many ways.
1049560	1053800	I know, it's so crazy that Xbox Live had integrated voice chat.
1055720	1060680	You know, not like a modern company nowadays that has a modern system can't integrate voice chat
1060680	1067880	into theirs, but you know. Calm that hate boner down, Loki. Jesus. Let's see. Other comments over
1067880	1074280	at live.vognetwork.com. Act Def says, independent development for games. That's a very good point
1074360	1082280	now too, is that things like Steam, iTunes and Google Play, you know, they've allowed more indie
1082280	1087080	developers to really get out there. I mean, sure. There's always been a place for indie developers
1087080	1092520	and you could design something that back in the day we used to go on to a BBS and download, but
1092520	1099880	it's different now. Like things like PlayStation, Xbox, even Nintendo are opened up so that more
1099880	1104200	indie developers can get on the store and you can, you know, download things right next to things
1104200	1110520	like Mario and, you know, Ridge Racer and all these other, you know, big, big thick titles
1110520	1114920	that are on the other platforms. So it's a bit of Ridge Racer. Why won't they come back?
1115720	1120280	Maybe, maybe someday, someday. Uh, and I'll do one more here and then I want to move into what's
1120280	1124840	going on this week. That's the 200 mountain chat over at live.vognetwork.com says World of Warcraft
1124840	1129960	is up there too. Granted, it wasn't the first MMO, but it definitely catapulted online and
1129960	1135400	MMOs to mainstream. Oh, absolutely. I totally agree with that. World of Warcraft. It wasn't
1135400	1141240	the first MMO, but it was a fucking massive MMO and has changed many things. Fuck, Dark
1141240	1146200	Sakura still plays it pretty regularly, if I'm not mistaken. Not so much these days. I mean like
1146200	1151080	EverQuest wasn't, you wouldn't consider like EverQuest 2 or something like that? Like I said,
1151080	1156760	WoW wasn't the first MMO, but it was massive. And EverQuest, you know, it's kind of right up
1156760	1161480	there. EverQuest did a lot as well, but you know, something about the way Blizzard does it. And,
1161480	1164840	you know, we've said this before on the show, Blizzard has a great way to take a game like
1164840	1169640	EverQuest and make it more accessible. But EverQuest was a lot like Final Fantasy 11,
1169640	1173880	because Final Fantasy 11 was really inspired by EverQuest, where you had to kneel down to
1173880	1179480	regenerate mana for quite some time. And a lot of transport took a very long time. So it's like
1179480	1184680	World of Warcraft brought a lot of like quality of life, quote unquote, improvements to the genre
1184680	1189240	that I think allowed it to really catapult forward. But not to say that EverQuest wasn't
1189240	1194280	important because hell yeah, it was. So was Ultima Online. So was the MUDs of the, you know,
1194280	1198600	older days on Telnet and all that, you know, all that stuff was the reason why World of Warcraft
1198600	1203240	exists now. And now there's MMOs after it. The World of Warcraft is evolving because of,
1203240	1209640	you know, things like Guild Wars, Guild Wars 2, Final Fantasy 14, Elder Scrolls and all these
1209640	1213560	games, you know, even WoW takes some of its cues from at this point. So, you know, that whole
1213560	1219960	genre has really been pushed forward. So, Act Deft brings up Pokemon Go. I mean, even though that's
1219960	1229160	really recent, certainly that almost feels like kind of a litmus test for the future in some ways,
1229160	1232120	especially with the fact that, you know, like I said, more and more people are gaming with
1232120	1235160	phones in their pocket. You know, what Pokemon Go did was a very,
1236120	1241080	it's a thing that we don't see very often in gaming. So anyhow, lots of good answers,
1241080	1248360	you guys. But let's talk about what's going on this week in games. Lots of news. E3. So last
1248360	1253560	week on the show, we talked about Microsoft. We talked about EA a little bit as well. And so
1253560	1258360	after the show happened, Bethesda's conference happened where they showed pretty much a lot of
1258360	1261800	things we expected to see. And then they showed that Wolfenstein 2 kind of cut.
1261800	1265000	Yeah. I mean, I expected that.
1265000	1268120	Yeah. And Evil Within 2, which I think a lot of people were expecting as well, which,
1268120	1272040	you know, and it was a lot of people were like, it's short. It was short.
1272040	1274760	It was, it was only 30 minutes, but they showed off like,
1274760	1276680	It was longer than that, but it was, it was still short.
1276680	1277000	Really?
1277000	1279720	Like 45 or an hour, but still, it's still.
1279720	1283720	But yeah, then they showed off. What else? So they kind of started off with, I want to say,
1283720	1287480	was it the VR stuff I think that they started off with? I don't remember, but
1288040	1295400	they did show off like Doom VFR. They had Fallout 4 VR, which they kind of showed. I mean, it's just.
1295400	1298360	Did they do Skyrim VR there or did, was that, they saved that for Sony?
1300200	1305160	That was Sony. So they did those two and then they were showing off,
1306440	1309640	I guess this is all going to be completed out of order. So they had the DLC for
1310200	1317080	Dishonored 2 that they showed off. They had, of course, you know,
1317080	1321880	the trailers for the other games. I know they ended with Wolfenstein. They showed off.
1322840	1327480	Let me ask, not to backtrack too much, but I have to ask this because I'm curious about this and
1327480	1330520	the chatters as well. Do you want to play Fallout in VR?
1330520	1333080	Yeah, I think it'd be fun. I don't know.
1333080	1333960	What about Skyrim?
1334520	1338840	Skyrim looks fun in VR. I see. I didn't see the trailer like originally. I mean,
1338840	1343720	it looks all right. I'd just be curious to see how it, how it actually moves around and plays
1343720	1348760	because like the trailer looks like, and this is the thing, like the trailers look like you kind
1348760	1354200	of have free control of your character, which is fine. But then like the Doom one had like
1354200	1357960	teleporting around. I really don't like VR that teleports around. I know
1357960	1362840	the reason that they do that is because people get motion sick, but honestly,
1362840	1366200	I know I'm not one of those people that gets motion sick from that.
1367160	1371320	See, and there's folks in chat, like Dr. Seuss says, I play Doom VR and I kind of look at that
1371320	1375880	and go, um, I would need a barf bag too because Doom is a fat, I mean, maybe they make some
1375880	1379560	adjustments, but Doom is a fast moving game. It's teleporting though. So you're, you're,
1379560	1383640	you can dash, I guess, in different directions, but it's all basically blinking from one spot
1383640	1387720	to another. And that's what a lot of these VR games do. And it's all right, but it's,
1388440	1393880	Doom was such a fast paced game that like, it doesn't seem like you'd be able to do that.
1393880	1398440	Yeah. Yeah. I would like the option to be able to just run around and stuff. And then, you know,
1398440	1403080	if I don't want to do that, I can teleport. Maybe it's because of the control scheme because you're
1403080	1408360	using the Vive controllers. And so, you know, maybe there's not really analog sticks that can
1408360	1411800	move you around like that. Um, I know with Skyrim, they are saying one of the options,
1411800	1415320	you can play with the controller. So that'd be fine too. If I'm playing with just the controller
1415320	1421960	and I can look around, man, I think that'd be pretty cool. Um, so after Bethesda, uh,
1421960	1426200	Monday morning, hold on. Yeah, hold on. Sure. There's still more stuff to talk about,
1426200	1429720	but that's okay. Um, because of course we talked, they showed off, um,
1431640	1438680	I know they didn't show off. They show Skyrim for the switch during Bethesda. Was that three?
1438680	1443240	Yes, because that's when they announced, Oh, which ties into last week's show by the way,
1443240	1446440	cause I remember, no, cause I tweeted you right away. Cause we had just talked about
1446440	1451480	an hour before that's when they showed in Skyrim, they had the Zelda stuff was in amiibo support.
1451560	1457560	It was the amiibo would unlock, um, link costume and the master sword, which you
1457560	1463240	fucking said on OLR. I had said the temple of time or something. They put a new dungeon in there.
1463240	1468920	So I'd like to think I was close, but yeah, that was a, that was a good call. And, and,
1470040	1475000	and to, to piggyback on what we were saying last week, I said, people are not going to buy Skyrim
1475000	1478920	yet again, if there's not something for them. And I said, if they want to appeal to the Nintendo
1478920	1484200	fan base, put fucking Zelda stuff in there and that Nintendo fans will eat that up. And guess
1484200	1489240	what was happening on Twitter. Then my Nintendo fan boys on Twitter were eating it up and were
1489240	1492680	like, yeah, I'm going to get Skyrim. And I was like, see that that's how they're going to sell
1492680	1498120	it on the switch. Anyways. Um, but the, the thing though that I noticed that they were talking about
1498120	1504280	is they're brand new. Um, I forget what they're calling it now, but it's like, um, a companion
1504280	1511080	service that they have for Skyrim and for fallout for where they're basically going to selling mods.
1511080	1516280	Yeah, no, because they've tried this bullshit before on steam and there's a huge fucking
1516280	1523320	backlash for it. And so now they're doubling down and trying it again on, I always assume on console
1523320	1529800	and on, um, the steam version as well. So basically this would allow creators to, to create
1529800	1535480	mods that they're going to supposedly it's going to go through some sort of QA, but that's a QA
1535480	1540200	that's that's peachy. Um, so they're going to go through some QA process and it's supposed
1540200	1545880	to work with the DLC and stuff, but at the same time, it's basically like, you know, they're
1545880	1552840	saying that, you know, Bethesda can sell stuff through this marketplace and it was allowed the
1552840	1557400	trophies and everything that still work, but it's not going to get rid of the other mods that are
1557400	1565640	free. But I just, I just don't like it. I don't like it at all. It just, it's sours new. Modding
1565640	1569640	has been going on for a long time. People don't sell mods. People just make mods because they
1569640	1574600	want to make mods. And now I just think this is not a good thing because they're going, they're
1574600	1578840	going to fuck it up here. Here's my take on it. And some folks are going to strongly disagree with
1578840	1586040	me and that's okay. But I have moved the fuck on from Skyrim. Like I'm, that's cool that they can
1586040	1592200	mod it and all this stuff, but I, I'm done with Skyrim. We're done. Right. You're done. Skyrim
1592200	1597160	quality four is relatively new, but if this shit's going to work right now that you better believe
1597160	1601320	that whenever the next other schools game comes out, they're going to do that shit again. That's
1601320	1605000	fair. All right, let's move on for time's sake though. The only reason I was trying to get us
1605000	1610120	past this for time, that's okay. So quickly, the PC gaming thing, I don't think there was a lot of
1610120	1614200	bigs, the age empires. They were trying to push like, there's like some VR game that they're
1614200	1619000	trying to push as an e-sport that looks just like enters game. I mean, it is all right. I mean,
1619560	1626040	I don't know VR and e-sports, I don't, that's a hard mix, but Nino Cooney on PC that caught my
1626040	1630920	ear too. Cause I was not expecting that to go to PC. That always struck me as a very like
1630920	1635800	console based thing. So that was surprising to me. Uh, and then there was the Ubisoft,
1635800	1640600	which pretty much had some pretty good stuff. Yeah. And everybody's mainly talking about the
1640600	1645000	beyond good and evil two, which, you know, that big reveal there that yes, it's still coming.
1645000	1650760	Yes. So the rabbit's cross Mario game looks all right. Um, that's an upgrade for you.
1652680	1656680	It sold you a little bit on, no, it didn't sell me. It looks okay. Like it's not the type of
1656680	1661240	game play. Doesn't that sound like an upgrade for where he was at last week though? I think it does.
1661240	1667240	I never said it would sound terrible. Some of their other like VR games that they have coming
1667240	1673880	out look okay. They're um, I'm trying to remember what it's called now, but like their new toys to
1673880	1679160	life game looks like shit. It's like some space combat thing. Like that is really weird. It's
1679160	1684040	like it attaches to the controller. You have this stupid toy spaceship on your controller.
1684040	1690520	It just seems really awkward and strange, but they've got that. Um, you know, obviously the,
1690520	1696520	um, new far cry game looks awesome. Um, I'm trying to think. Um, I didn't really care about
1696520	1702920	the pirates game. I don't care about assassin's creed, um, with my UAV Eagle or whatever it was.
1703640	1709240	Um, what else? I don't remember everything else that they had. I know that they had a new,
1709240	1714600	the crew game, which I don't know. That's all right. I guess. But I think out of everything,
1714600	1720280	like there, they had a pretty impressive lineup of games, I guess. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. It
1720280	1724680	seems like a lot of people were very pleased with Ubisoft. And again, I, I have not been calling on
1724680	1728840	dark soccer or Misty because I don't think they watch these things, but please, please, by all
1728840	1734360	means, jump in. If you have something to say on, on this stuff. Okay. I still want to dominate the
1734360	1740440	conversation with, with you two here. So, um, but, uh, let's see also, uh, let's see after Ubisoft,
1740440	1743480	let's talk about Sony. So let's spend a little time on Sony because obviously it's one of the
1743480	1749160	bigger ones. I tried to watch live, but I was at the park of my kids. And so I ate through my data
1749240	1756360	plan pretty fast. So I, I missed a few things, but I did see some of it. So it was pretty much like I
1756360	1761400	anticipated that it was going to be just, we're showing new trailers for games we've already
1761400	1766680	announced. And to be honest, the whole like shadow classes thing that had already been leaked out,
1766680	1770360	that it was coming as an announcement. So I wasn't all that surprised by it. I mean,
1770360	1774840	it looks cool, but it's like the second time they've remade that game already. Yeah. I was,
1775160	1780600	I was like, Oh, okay, cool. Um, I wasn't expecting that. I didn't pick up on the leak thing,
1780600	1785720	but I was kinda like, Oh, all right, cool. Yeah. So, I mean, it is a good, it is a good game,
1785720	1789720	but yeah, it just, it did, they did remaster it just the last time. Yeah. But then they have like,
1789720	1793160	I guess new trailers and my whole thing was like, I wanted to see what they were going to do with,
1793160	1797800	you know, PlayStation VR. And I kind of missed some of that in the Skyrim thing. Sounds kind
1797800	1802200	of cool. I'd be definitely willing to check it out. Um, what are the, there was a game called
1802200	1811240	Moss that kind of caught me. I don't know. It's it's okay. I, I heard super hots coming to, um,
1811240	1815480	the PlayStation VR. I think that was that I'm interested in because that looks awesome on PC,
1816120	1820680	the VR version. So I'd want to check that out. Um, you know, they showed off, you know,
1820680	1827320	the new trip, like it's a new trailers for, um, that zombie game that they have days gone days
1827320	1830920	gone. Yeah. It looked okay. I mean, I don't know. It's just kind of a generic,
1832360	1835800	there's a lot of games that they have coming that I just don't care about.
1835800	1841800	You know, honestly, like here's the thing. I had a very tepid reaction to Sony's conference. I like,
1841800	1845320	I was like, okay. But there was also, there was still a part of me that was kind of like, that's
1845320	1852440	it. Like I here's, and here's the thing for me is that Sony started, like, I don't know if you saw
1852440	1858600	anything in that hour before the press conference, but I feel like some of the best shit was before
1858600	1863800	the press conference even started. So when they announced undertale is coming to PlayStation four
1863800	1868440	and Vita, I was like, okay, if they're announcing this before the conference even begins, what kind
1868440	1872920	of fucking Whopper are they about to drop on us? And then when that Whopper didn't come, I was like,
1872920	1878520	Oh, okay. Like they said that they're holding off on announcements for games com. Like they've got
1878520	1882840	stuff that they are going to announce a games weird to me, it is kind of weird. But at the
1882840	1887320	same time, like I was disappointed that nothing was addressed about backwards compatibility.
1887320	1892040	It's just like, whatever. There was no, they don't care. It would have been nice to see some
1892040	1896200	sort of price drops for like at least the PlayStation pro or something would have been
1896200	1899960	cool. I guess they had stuff on sale in the gold PlayStation four and stuff like that.
1901160	1905240	But yeah, there wasn't really a whole ton of new announcements. I mean, there's a lot of stuff that
1905240	1909560	they just didn't show. And I'm assuming that's all going to be a games com in a little bit, but
1910520	1914680	yeah, it's just kind of, and then on top of that, there wasn't really any big titles,
1914680	1919720	which one of these big titles is coming out this holiday? Cause I couldn't figure out which one it
1919720	1927560	was. It was, it is the uncharted spinoff is the holiday one. Ooh. Yeah. I mean, and that's,
1927560	1931560	that's kind of why I think I ended up having a very tepid reaction to Sony. Like I didn't,
1931560	1935000	I didn't hate it, but I knew some other people, some other friends of mine were kind of getting
1935000	1938520	into it a little bit. Cause they were like, Oh, it was awesome. And all this stuff. And I was like,
1938520	1942840	I guess maybe it's just because I'm not as into God of war as other people I know. And I really
1942840	1947720	don't care about this days gone stuff, but I did feel like it was like a lot of updates. And to be
1947720	1954680	fair, to be fair to Sony, they've had some really killer E3 years and not every year can be the
1954680	1962120	final fantasy seven remake flack Shenmue three flack. Like they can't all be that year where
1962120	1966440	they, you know, whip it out and put it on the table. Like you're, you know, here, that would
1966440	1971800	be unreasonable. Here's, here's, here's some of my expectations being horribly, uh, or I'm being
1971800	1980280	horribly disappointed by it. Final fantasy 15 VR support, uh, fucking fish. Are you fucking kidding
1980280	1984680	me? Like one of the reasons I bought 15 is because, Oh, the VR is going to be fucking sweet.
1984680	1989080	And you know, the game looks pretty sweet. I haven't gone back to play the game, but
1989080	1993880	are you serious? Why even waste your time with a fucking fishing game? It's just so
1993880	1998200	goddamn stupid. Nobody is getting excited about it. I mean, it was, it's the fucking
1998200	2003480	nineties and Sega bass fishing's coming out. Nobody fucking cares about a fishing game in
2003480	2007720	final fantasy. Uh, dark Tetsuya and chat says they've come a long way since that disaster in
2007720	2013880	2006. Nobody's going to fuck up that bad ever again. That's that's a given nobody in the
2013880	2017960	industry and Nintendo didn't have a great year. It was that year or the year after Nintendo.
2017960	2021560	There was Microsoft that one year. So, I mean, yeah, that's true. That's true. So, but
2022360	2027160	you know, I we've come a long way from there and I didn't, I didn't hate Sony by any means,
2027160	2031800	but it was one of those when it was done, I was left with polite clapping. That was,
2031800	2035960	that was, it was a polite clap. I was like, I was like, Oh man, you know, I, I missed the last
2035960	2039880	end, the end of the conference. And then I went back and read them like, Oh, okay. You know,
2039880	2043400	what else needs to be addressed? Because I bet many people forget this because this is the sort
2043400	2048920	of things that people forget, but the audio on Twitch, and apparently it was also the audio
2048920	2054680	stream that was going to all the movie theaters was like borked the first 15 minutes. And when
2054680	2059000	you have the spotlight on you, you can't afford those kinds of fuckups. I'm sorry. That was,
2059000	2063720	that was, that was pretty embarrassing. So I just, I have to call that out that that was,
2063720	2067080	it was a little bit of a disappointment that something that you would think would be that
2067080	2070440	simple. It must be something about that venue because they moved to that venue last year.
2070440	2074600	And I remember last year had an audio problem too. So Sony might need to think about changing
2074600	2077720	the venue. If that's, what's causing their audio problems. I don't know. But I just,
2077720	2082920	it kind of, I think Loki, that's why you might've missed the uncharted is the holiday game because
2082920	2086280	that was when the audio was fucking up. So I watched on YouTube. I didn't have,
2086280	2091480	Oh, that's why. But then YouTube was like lagged. YouTube was like almost a minute behind. It was
2091480	2097800	weird. But anyway, I, I had to call that out. Just kind of a stern, stern finger waving.
2098280	2102520	Um, but I mean, not to say like, again, it's not like I'm like, Oh, I'm going to sell my
2102520	2107560	PS4. It was so bad. No, it wasn't. Um, and you know, the Spider-Man game looks sweet,
2107560	2113560	I guess. I mean, but I just, I feel like, okay, that was the big reveal last year and Days Gone
2113560	2119080	was shown twice last year. And God of War was last year. And all this shit was last year.
2119080	2122680	Detroit looked all right. Detroit did look all right. That game, I'm, I'm,
2122680	2125720	probably more than anything else they showed. I'm looking forward to it. It's in the lead
2125720	2129960	there. Was that the, that's, is that the guy from like fucking, um, Grey's Anatomy?
2129960	2131880	Cause it sure as hell looks like the guy from Grey's Anatomy.
2131880	2136280	I don't know actors and what they're on very well. It is a real person. It is a real person.
2136280	2138760	But yeah, it looks like the, I forget his name, but.
2138760	2145160	Um, but I will say this. Sony was also strangely short. It was very short. It was an hour,
2145160	2150680	not 90 minutes. Not, they went two hours, one year. It was an hour. Uh, now you could say that
2150680	2156200	the pre-show hour, I mean, again, cause they, there was that Jack box looking thing where they
2156200	2160520	had, everybody was on their phone controlling the game. And there was a game from the Until Dawn
2160520	2166200	people that was like, you had somebody that was like a rebel spy, basically in your midst that
2166200	2168200	was trying to screw the game over. And that looked like a lot of fun.
2168200	2170280	Yeah. It is the guy from Grey's Anatomy. That's why I thought I knew him.
2170280	2174200	Okay. But I was like, it was just weird to me because I felt like the things I got most
2174200	2177960	excited about with Sony were all like the pre-show content, which I don't know what
2177960	2182360	that says about me as a gamer. But anyway, with the short stuff, here's something else I noticed
2182360	2189240	was really missing, really, really missing. The sizzle reel of third party and independent stuff.
2189240	2195480	I mean, sure you had Destiny 2. I know that, you know, the Call of Duty or whatever. I know third
2195480	2200440	parties weren't absent, but where, where was that sizzle reel of indie games? Indie games were gone.
2201240	2207400	And this, and I remember the year when they had all these indie developers up on stage,
2207400	2211720	bam, bam, bam, bam. Like there was like, all these games are coming to PS4. And that was like
2211720	2217960	a big year. And it was, it felt absent. It felt really absent this year to not be showcasing some
2217960	2224040	of the indie and the lower support on the main stage. That was a little regretful, I think for,
2224040	2230760	for Sony. But, um, otherwise it was okay. That's, that's really like, it wasn't good. It wasn't bad.
2230760	2237160	It was, it was polite clap. I had a nice polite clap at the end. Um, how about, uh, I don't know
2237160	2242040	if there's anything you guys want to add with Sony or anything you guys saw or read about after
2242040	2248600	the fact. No, I don't know if it's particularly Sony, but I'm still pretty excited about Marvel
2248600	2255640	versus Capcom, infinite. You're like the only one I know. I'm sorry. If you play the demo, you might
2255640	2262280	not, you might. And more than that, I'm actually super interested in, uh, the Dragon Ball FighterZ.
2262280	2266360	Okay. Yeah. Cause it's Arc Systems. Microsoft showed that, didn't they? That was on their thing.
2267320	2271320	But it is, but that is going to be on both. Um, but I will say with the Marvel versus Capcom,
2271320	2275000	the biggest complaints I'm hearing about it are the art style. Like Chun Li looks like she's
2275000	2279720	regressed a little bit. That's what I'm hearing. I was perfectly fine with the art style because,
2279720	2282760	I mean, basically I was just really paying attention to try to hear you the whole time.
2283480	2289240	Although I'm not excited about his voice just because I've gotten more familiar with his
2289240	2296120	Japanese voice. So I'm hoping that I can play it in Japanese and have the voices. I'm more
2296120	2299560	familiar with Troy Baker doing all the voices this year. He should do all of them.
2300440	2304440	But I am, I'm, I'm pretty excited. I mean, it might just be the Dragon Ball kick I've been
2304440	2310360	on lately too, but I mean, a Dragon Ball game done by the fucking guilty gear people sign me up.
2311640	2317000	How about a fighting game? That's Troy Baker versus who's the other guy that doesn't know
2317000	2323800	this is Nolan North versus, um, Tara strong. I was like, who's the lady that does he have
2323800	2329160	Tara strong. So it will do that. Like it'll be a, it'll be a trio game. I don't know. Anyway,
2329160	2334760	uh, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Uh, let's see free kill zero and chat asks,
2334760	2341480	Oh yeah. With Destiny 2, what platform are you all including chat considering PC 100%?
2341480	2347000	I don't even care that there's a gap PC, PC, PC. I don't really, I'm not that interested in
2347000	2351640	Destiny 2 just because I never played the first one. Although I have it. I just haven't played it.
2352200	2354520	If I was going to pick a platform, it'd probably be PC.
2355080	2363240	No, I, I, I, on my new 4k rig, I'm going to have by the holiday trust. That's like coming out of
2363240	2368280	E3. That was like my number one takeaway is that I fucking want a 4k monitor and a 4k a graphics
2368280	2373560	card. That'll do it. Yes. I'm well aware. You can't get one for $500, which is why, but I,
2373560	2379400	I will invest a little more in my PC because I do so much gaming on my PC.
2379960	2385640	So, um, yeah, for sure. Destiny 2 on PC. Um, so, okay. So I think that's all there is to
2385640	2390680	say about Sony for now. So how about Loki? How about Nintendo? How about Nintendo?
2390680	2394680	I mean, Nintendo is okay. I'm trying to, I'm trying to think of the exact stuff that they
2394680	2399400	showed. So like I remember, um, well they ended with Odyssey. So it was,
2400200	2404360	but Mario Odyssey looks fucking sweet. Mario Odyssey looks really good. And I watched, um,
2404360	2408920	like the hat on everything that was rad. I mean, that's all right. Yeah. I watched like, um,
2409000	2413400	actual like gameplay they were doing like up through treehouse live. So I watched a lot of
2413400	2417880	that. Cool. I mean, it looks pretty good. It looks like a good Mario game, which is
2417880	2423880	good. It's what the system needs. I'm not super excited. I mean, I was never really in the 3d
2424440	2428840	Metroid games, Metroid prime for just announcing that they're working on that.
2430280	2437000	I mean, cool. When the fuck is it coming out? No idea. I mean, so that's cool. At least that
2437000	2441320	they're working on it. I feel, I feel a little differently here because I'm just,
2441320	2446920	I was so fucking happy that Nintendo acknowledged Metroid, you know, especially after forgetting
2446920	2451240	its birthday, that Nintendo was like, yes, we're doing Metroid prime for even though
2451240	2456360	retro is not doing it, which is interesting. I like the, I'm not as big on the 3d Metroids
2456360	2461160	myself, but I did like prime three and I liked the original prime when it was out.
2461960	2466040	I'm going to fucking play it. I'm sure that the new, the new prime game is going to be,
2466760	2470600	look really nice. Cause I mean, it's what was prime three on? Was that the, that wasn't the
2470600	2474440	Wii was it? It was on Wii. Yeah. Cause they did the trilogy. They did the trilogy, the trilogy,
2474440	2478760	but when did it originally come out? That was on game. It wasn't Louis. Yeah. Because I had,
2478760	2482920	yeah, I had the motion controls. What Metro prime three was on the Wii one and one and two,
2482920	2485880	I think were game cube three was on the Wii. And then they did the trilogy on the Wii.
2485880	2490120	I think maybe I'm wrong. I thought I played Metro prime three on the Wii,
2490120	2494040	but maybe I just didn't get on board until, okay. Act F confirms it was on the Wii because
2494040	2497880	yeah, I thought motion controls were a big part of the Wii. I mean, that was a SC system. So,
2497880	2502120	I mean, this will look much better anyway. So I'm interested to see what the multiplayer,
2502760	2509480	um, potential there. I mean that they would take from, uh, what was the one on DS when at first
2509480	2513720	that was, it was a multiplayer heavy thing on the DS. It was the one that was like the pack-in game.
2513720	2517080	Yeah. I remember that. I don't remember. It's called, I remember the name of it either,
2517080	2521160	but I I'm excited to see what they're probably, cause it seems very likely that we'll,
2521160	2524280	we're going to get multiplayer in this, whatever it's going to be. And that could be,
2524280	2531240	that could be an e-sport Loki. They hunters prime hunters. Thank you. I knew it wasn't
2531240	2535240	Federation force. I started to go there, but what was that you said before the show?
2535800	2544360	Metroid prime for duration force. Yeah. I was going to say, uh, what else did they show?
2544360	2549880	They showed off was that they, they talked about DLC for Zelda, which is all right. And we knew
2549880	2553880	that was kind of coming already. So the first piece is I think going to be at the end of this
2553880	2559000	month. Yeah. It looked pretty hot. The rest is later. Um, they showed off that rocket league
2559000	2564600	is going to be coming to the switch. There's a part of me that's kind of like, okay, fucking
2564600	2569800	rocket. Like it's not quite as bad as Skyrim, but I'm like, okay, rocket league is like literally
2569800	2576760	everywhere else. But then I do think about, okay, but the switch is a really good system for it
2576760	2580920	with its portability and everything. Like it's kind of one of those. Okay. Yeah. This kind of
2580920	2585960	has to happen. Like it makes a lot of sense to have rocket league on switch. There was that we
2585960	2590920	have to backtrack a little bit. It wasn't in there a 30 minute thing, which really blew again. What
2590920	2595960	the same thing as Sony, a big bombshell that they didn't put in their main presentation.
2595960	2603560	Not only is there Metroid prime four, there is a Metroid on 3DS, which I thought Nintendo was
2603560	2608840	going to walk away from 3DS a long time ago to focus on the switch, but clearly no, there is now
2608840	2614840	a Metroid game that is a remake of Metroid two. That's going to be on the 3DS. And a lot of people
2614840	2621160	are saying, Oh, that's why they pulled AM2R. No, they pulled AM2R because it was Nintendo period.
2622120	2625480	In this, it's just a coincidence that they had their own thing in development.
2625480	2632360	Why that game is not on the switch as well. Like why not? Why can't you develop it for two systems?
2632360	2638680	I'm kind, in a way I'm with you, but at the same time, I'm like, I am just fucking happy
2638680	2643720	it's happening. I am fucking happy it's happening and great. I already own a 3DS. Cool. I just hope
2643720	2649160	it's not a new 3DS exclusive, but nothing they said indicated that. But if it's unique to new
2649160	2655640	3DS, I'm going to be a little salty. I'm a little salty, but I'll probably finally fucking upgrade
2655640	2662520	if it is. Cause I want to play it. Yes, it's Metroid. I will do stupid things. The new Yoshi
2662520	2667480	game that looks kind of like paper Yoshi or something. I mean, yeah, that looked kind of
2667480	2671160	cool. You know, that Yoshi game did pretty good on Wii U. So they're kind of doing like a spiritual
2671160	2675720	successor. Act Deft would have your head if you forgot to mention Kirby. No, I was just going to
2675720	2681640	say that. Yes, that's right. It was new Kirby and that look cute. Uh, and I Kirby, you know,
2681640	2686440	had some pretty solid entries on the Wii and the Wii U. So, you know, it's, it's logical that the
2686440	2690520	Switch was getting one. I kind of didn't expect it, but at the same time I was like, Oh yeah,
2690520	2696360	well this makes sense. Right. So it looked cute. Uh, although 2018, not this holiday.
2696360	2703480	Yeah. Also absent were additional Wii U remasters. And a lot of people convinced, including myself,
2704120	2708840	that Smash Brothers was going to be a remaster for this year, but it appears time. I mean,
2708840	2712840	I don't think they're going to do smash. I think, well, they have the Pokken one that's coming out.
2712840	2718360	There is Pokken. I kind of think what could have happened is that similar to Splatoon 2,
2718360	2723000	it might've started as a remaster and somewhere along the line, they've said, you know what,
2723560	2727800	let's just make it a new game. And so Smash has been tabled for a year or two while they
2727800	2731480	do that. And that's, you know, as long as it's good, that's all I fucking want.
2732440	2738920	So, and Bayonetta as a character still would be great as well. So there's that, uh,
2738920	2743240	Xenoblade Chronicles 2 had some more stuff shown that is a holiday title. We shouldn't forget.
2743240	2749160	It's an RPG. It was pretty damn good on Wii U, uh, and, and the other one that they had on Wii. So,
2749160	2753400	um, I don't see why it will be bad on Switch. I'm looking forward to that for sure.
2753960	2759720	So, uh, there was also Fire Emblem Warriors had a little peek at that and I'm not super into that
2759720	2764760	series either, but cool. And then some more Amiibo, of course, Breath of the Wild, but the
2764760	2770600	Metro, the Metroid squishy ones. I like those. The Metroid one looked kind of cool. Um, and then
2770600	2778120	of course they have Amiibo that ties in with the new Mario Odyssey as well. Um, uh, come on,
2778120	2782360	Noel Gus in our chat room says, I'm wondering if they're delaying Smash for a year to try to make
2782360	2787240	arms and esports thing. And we did, I don't know if it's so much the esports thing, although I'm
2787240	2791240	confident. Yes. Nintendo wants arms to be esports, but all that debate aside,
2791880	2796040	maybe Nintendo really did kind of take a step back and say, you know what? We've got arms,
2796040	2798360	we've got poke, and maybe there is too much fighting this year.
2798360	2801240	Popular arms is going to be first because if there's no one playing it,
2801240	2803160	you can't have it to be a fucking e-sport.
2803160	2807080	I it's the people that I know that bought it are enjoying it.
2807080	2811800	I get it. It's, it's out now with one of the, it's one of the few games that's on the system,
2811800	2816040	but come like the end of the year when there's Mario and Splatoon shit,
2816040	2818200	how many people are really going to be playing arms by then?
2818200	2822920	So I, as you're saying, so let's evaluate how popular arms still is after Mario.
2823800	2830120	Okay. The legs ha ha. You want to see arms as legs. Yes, I get it. I get it. That's a,
2830120	2833720	no, that's a good way to put it. So, I mean, cause yeah, I mean, it's popular now,
2833720	2839160	but like there's not a whole lot of shit out right now for it. So let's just see how that is.
2839160	2845000	And also let's see what online looks like next year. I mean, cause, but I I'm worried that,
2845000	2849400	you know, Splatoon that's going to come out and I was like, I forgot all about arms.
2849400	2854200	I'm playing Splatoon. To be fair to arms, even though I was not thrilled with the demo and I'm
2854200	2857640	not going to plunk down the asking price for it, but to be fair to it, it does sound like they
2857640	2862120	plan to support it in a similar method to how they're supporting Overwatch with free DLC
2862120	2866920	characters, because I know they talked about one this last week. So there is that Loki,
2866920	2872200	they're trying to give arms legs through DLC. So there is that. All right. And it, it's,
2872200	2876440	it's worked incredibly well for Overwatch, although that's a whole nother beast.
2877400	2885320	Blizzard's Overwatch, which probably is esports. Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com
2885320	2893560	actdeft in chat says Twintelle has legs for days. YYR says, hold on a second. Nintendo is at least
2893560	2897320	five to 10 years behind the rest of the world, right? Shouldn't they not be due to look into
2897320	2904440	esports until about 2025? Vidpower in chat says, poor soccer eye. He's so worked to the bone for
2904440	2909400	so many years making Smash games. I kind of hope they give him a break. And Kaijuto says arms and
2909400	2914760	Splatoon are not the same kind of game. There is room for both. So we'll, we'll, we will see.
2915400	2921960	We will see. All right. But I, I was, I was pleased with Nintendo overall, especially the
2921960	2928440	Metroid things, obviously that made me giddy. Um, and otherwise I think it was, you know, yeah,
2928440	2933880	I try not to set the bar too high for Nintendo. Right. So I was like, okay, my expectations were
2933880	2938120	not, I think it's going to do well. They have a solid Mario game coming out. So, I mean,
2939720	2943480	there's no reason the system is not going to do well through holiday with bad. I mean that,
2943480	2947800	that alone will sell systems. Yeah. We don't, we don't even know, you know, a lot of what the
2947800	2952280	online library is going to look like. Again, they didn't spot like too much. I mean, a little bit,
2952280	2955560	because obviously with rocket league, I do remember, and I don't think it's on our list
2955560	2959720	here, but like, I know that there's people interviewing Reggie and he dodged all questions
2959720	2962920	regarding like virtual console and online or anything, but people have to remember,
2962920	2968040	that's what they do at E3. And that's part of the reason why E3 is kind of a show that I'm,
2968040	2973080	I personally am kind of over attending because they stay to the script and they will not deviate
2973080	2979240	from the script at E3. You have to talk to indie publishers, smaller studios, and people that are
2979240	2984280	very passionate about their game to get them to go off script about the games. Nintendo, Microsoft,
2984280	2989640	Sony are not going to go off script ever. So people that were trying to get Reggie to go off
2989640	2994120	script, what the fuck were you expecting to happen? Like, sorry, that's just the real, I know it's
2994120	2999880	disappointing, but have you not been paying attention to E3 since it landed on the internet
3000360	3001240	so many years ago?
3004520	3009080	Just saying. I like how he's like, I'm tired of people asking me about Mother 3. Well then,
3009080	3012120	you know what? Maybe she'll fucking release it. Well, there's something you could do about that,
3012120	3018280	you know? Yeah, exactly. I wish I could go a day without people asking me that. I thought I could.
3018280	3022200	No you didn't. You didn't think that you could. You knew what was fucking going to happen.
3022200	3025720	Please don't even try to pretend that you didn't know that was going to happen.
3026680	3030760	All right. Jamie, Misty, anything you guys want to say about Nintendo?
3032040	3035960	Nothing surprising. But you're still not on board with Switch, right? Not yet?
3037320	3042760	Not really. Wii U was absent completely, which we, I mean, you have to expect that.
3042760	3048680	That's not surprising either. Except for its logo did show up with the Breath of the Wild DLC.
3048680	3052760	Well, of course. That was the one. It's out on that. Yeah, it is. It is. But otherwise,
3052760	3057400	Nintendo certainly has moved on from Wii U, although not 3DS, which is interesting.
3057400	3063480	All right. Oh, Act F does point out Wii U does have Just Dance 2018 coming.
3063480	3068920	They're probably releasing that on the PlayStation 2. Well, no, not anymore,
3068920	3072760	but probably the PlayStation 3. They usually go back a generation. I mean, they were releasing
3072760	3077080	that for the Wii, I think, up until like last year. Actually, Act F says it's also coming out
3077080	3084040	on the Wii. Just Dance 2018 is coming out on the Wii. It's, you know what? The Wii U is backwards.
3084040	3090840	It's probably the same fucking game that's on the Wii, just in a box that has the Wii U logo on it,
3090840	3095880	because it's all backwards compatible. Just saying. And it still works for those that have
3095880	3100600	not upgraded like me. And that is true. You know what? There's still, we have to remember,
3100600	3105560	we have one perspective because we do this show because we are gamer fans. So we tend to be more
3105560	3109160	on the quote-unquote cutting edge of games. But there are a lot of households that still
3109160	3113480	are rocking this. And why not? You know what? Praise Ubisoft for actually fucking publishing
3113480	3120520	a music game. Because you know what? Who the fuck else is? Let's put it that way. Because Konami,
3120520	3125000	fucking, unless there's music in fucking pachinko slot machine, they own, but they're not really
3125000	3129320	producing anything that's like a new... Outside the arcade. Outside the arcade, yeah.
3130440	3134280	All right. And Kaiju says, don't sleep on those Just Dance games. They're huge.
3134360	3138600	To go back though, one other thing to kind of go back to, you know, my bitch about like how
3138600	3144360	publishers are ruining stuff. And also talking about Ubisoft, which we've just briefly touched
3144360	3153320	on. Are you fucking serious? Ubisoft with an $800 version of fucking Assassin's Creed with a statue
3153320	3159960	in it? Really? Somebody's buying it. Somebody out there is buying it.
3159960	3161160	That's fucking retarded.
3161640	3164200	I... Somebody's buying it. Whatever.
3164200	3169080	That was almost as retarded as the... I want to say it was Wolfenstein. There was a version
3169080	3174360	of Wolfenstein, The New Blood that came out. It was a special edition that did not include the
3174360	3178840	game. I think like Mass Effect Andromeda had a version like that too. It came with the fucking
3178840	3182120	Mako, but it doesn't come with the game. We saw that at Best Buy the other day and Alan was like,
3182120	3186280	oh, here's the collector's edition. I said, notice how the box doesn't say any game platform on it.
3186280	3191880	It doesn't say PS4 or Xbox One because there's no game in it. It's just that fucking Mako thing in
3191880	3195560	it. And I was like, these things are going to end up on the clearance rack and when it does,
3195560	3205080	we should go get it. All right. Anyway, let's see. Orange Wright says Namco is still making
3205080	3208680	music games for home consoles. They have a Taiko on the Switch.
3208680	3213320	They do. And I think there's actually a PlayStation 4 version that's coming out soon.
3214280	3221560	PlayStation 4 also got Beat Zonic, Sonic X Beat, Super Beat Zonic. That's it.
3221560	3226360	Which is that Vita game just came over. So, I mean, there's music games happening out there,
3226360	3231240	but then we look at Project Rap Rabbit and well, that had its own. I mean,
3232680	3236760	what a great exhibition and how not to run your Kickstarter. That's all I'm going to say on that.
3236760	3241720	Like it sucks, but so was how they ran that whole Kickstarter from start to finish.
3241720	3242600	Oh, I missed that.
3242600	3247480	Yeah. Well, it just, it was very, it was very arrogant. Like, I'm sorry that
3247480	3250680	just that Rap Rabbit thing, Red is very arrogant to me.
3250680	3252040	Did they not make their Kickstarter?
3252040	3256840	Oh, they're not going to. I don't know if it's over yet, but it was nowhere close when I last
3256840	3260600	checked. Why haven't these public or these like developers learn like, you know, I'm famous
3260600	3265000	because I made this game. I'm going to put out a game and everybody's going to love it. You know,
3265000	3271560	that only worked for Inafune, or was it, I'm sorry, I'm getting names confused.
3271560	3274920	Who was it that did Bloodstained? Is that Inafune? That's not Inafune.
3274920	3275480	Igarashi.
3275480	3278920	Igarashi. I'm sorry. And it was with an I. Igarashi's.
3278920	3280600	Yeah, but Bloodstained looks really fucking good.
3280600	3283880	It does look fucking good, but like Inafune thought that they could do that with, you know,
3283880	3289000	Mighty No. 9 and then it ended up sucking. And then now, you know, they're thinking they're
3289000	3290360	going to be all cocky with this stuff.
3290360	3297640	This project, okay, Rap Rabbit has 20 hours to go out of the 1 million and 92,
3297640	3301480	1 million plus goal. It's 1 million 92,000 because of the currency conversion.
3301480	3304840	They have made about $200,000. They've made 20%.
3305560	3309800	They haven't, they have backers. It's, this is more proving that people want the game and well,
3310440	3312520	sorry, I guess it's not going to happen.
3312520	3314520	Yeah, it's, it's, it's an ouch.
3314520	3318440	Perhaps if you sold more $800 collector's editions, you'd hit that goal.
3318440	3321880	Well, perhaps if you hadn't come out saying making music games great again,
3321880	3327480	and then not showing any gameplay concept until two thirds of the way through your Kickstarter
3327480	3333000	project, maybe you would have had a different result. And, you know, this whole thing has
3333000	3336920	been trying to be sold. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I'm going off right now, but it's just,
3336920	3343080	as a music game fan, it's very, very disappointing to me. And I feel like a lot of this was that, oh,
3343080	3347720	we're the folks that made Elite Beat Agents and, you know, we made Parappa the Rappa.
3347720	3352280	And so this is the game we're going to make next dah, dah, dah, dah. These guys need to realize
3352280	3360760	that Inafune, Mega Man and Mighty No. 9 ruined it for them. They need to be able to show a lot
3360760	3366760	more coming out the gate than, well, we made this, so we're going to make this great. Sorry,
3366760	3371240	that ain't going to work anymore. It's just not. It's not.
3371240	3375800	Yeah, because Inafune, just because you have a good pedigree doesn't mean that
3375800	3377240	you're going to always make great games.
3377320	3380040	And you can thank Mighty No. 9 for the reason why this flopped.
3380760	3381560	Yeah.
3381560	3390600	So, sorry, it's harsh. But I hope they find a way to make it happen otherwise. But I just don't
3390600	3395720	think it's going to at this point. I think the 20% is so bad that I don't know how they're going to
3395720	3396200	do it. But I feel like-
3396200	3401560	Was it Amplitude like that too? Like, remember, like, harmonics? Did that make it school pretty
3401560	3402440	fast or-
3402440	3407400	No, it had, like, a big out the gate and then it really struggled and it looked like it was
3407400	3412520	going to be questionable. And then they kind of made it at the last second. So it was a little
3412520	3412840	different.
3412840	3416120	I know it's- I don't think it's on our show, but I know that Comcept actually just joined
3416120	3419000	their subsidiary now of Level 5. So-
3419000	3422680	Actually, I think you did have that story later on. So you might want to talk about that later.
3422680	3424840	We'll talk about it later on.
3424840	3425880	All right, we'll clear-
3425880	3426600	Spoiler!
3426600	3430360	Spoiler alert! Well, if you guys all read the gaming blogs, you already know anyway.
3430360	3433880	All right, let's move on. We have some more gaming news we want to cover. But of course,
3433880	3437240	we got to talk about our gaming weeks and what were the types of video games that we
3437240	3438680	have been playing this week.
3439480	3440840	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
3441800	3448200	It was kind of non-existent this week. Actually, I've been playing- Crap, what's the game called
3448200	3454760	again? Since I've been on my big Dragon Ball kick lately, I downloaded that game on iOS,
3455720	3461240	Dokkan Battle. And it's kind of neat. It's very flashy as I expect it to be. I haven't
3461240	3468040	gotten too far in it. And I've also been playing that Sailor Moon Sailor Drops. It's actually
3468040	3470360	kind of fun. It's like Bejeweled on crack.
3470360	3474440	Yeah, I think Alan was into that, the Japanese version on his phone. I think that's the same
3474440	3474840	one.
3474840	3477480	Pretty much. It's just the text that's been translated into English.
3477480	3477880	Right.
3477880	3482760	But I think it's like international server. So it's got all the original voices and everything.
3482760	3483320	It's okay.
3483320	3483820	Sure.
3484760	3491880	And I actually haven't even touched WoW, except for doing my dailies on my phone. And then
3491880	3497320	I ran out of resources. So I might have to log in and do a few things to get some more
3497320	3507400	resources. But I'm waiting until they release the new raid for LFR. And then I might do
3507400	3513720	that. The whole Sargeras raid. So we'll see how that goes. Other than that, I'm on the
3513720	3517480	fence for a game I want to buy. Again, because of my big Dragon Ball kick.
3518120	3526680	I really am thinking about getting Xenoverse 2. It looks fun. I like the MMO without being
3526680	3531320	an MMO thing. Because most of the time, you know how I am on most games. I'll play by
3531320	3536040	myself. I'm not really super social with that. I just like talking to people. So I think
3536040	3539160	it would be fun and it would be right up my alley. I just don't know anyone who's played
3539160	3543000	it. So I'm looking. Let me know if y'all have a favorable impression.
3543800	3548760	Or not. Before I drop 80 bucks on it. Well, because I'd be getting all the DLC at the
3548760	3556920	same time. Other than that, I've watched 60 episodes of Dragon Ball Super. That's what
3556920	3562200	I've been doing with my life. And the Drag Race reunion, which just annoyed me to no end.
3563080	3566680	You're the fan favorite. Yay, fan favorite. Yay, fan favorite.
3568280	3572200	Everyone applaud for the fan favorite. Thank you, Farrah Moan.
3574200	3576840	I laughed my ass off during that. Just gonna plug this week's episode
3576840	3581000	of Reading is Fundamental. It'll be fun. Although the thing, to sidestep a bit,
3581000	3585240	the thing that made me laugh was the reading back and forth with Trinity and Eureka. And
3585240	3587960	I'm so excited Eureka's on next season. All right.
3587960	3589800	Okay, done. All right, wrong show. All right,
3589800	3594600	Loki, how was your gaming week? So this week I was trying to play some different things,
3594600	3599480	but I ended up playing some of the same things. So I played actually Skyrim a little bit last
3599480	3605000	night. I was playing through Skyrim. I was doing some quests and stuff. I just finished up
3605560	3611560	doing one of the quests for, oh God, I don't remember now. It was,
3613720	3618920	oh, it doesn't matter. But I was playing through Skyrim and then of course it crashed. Well,
3618920	3623960	it didn't crash. It broke in a very unique way. So my whole screen is black unless I paused the
3623960	3628840	game and then I could see what was on the screen, but I couldn't do anything with that. So, you
3629720	3635160	is that point that I kind of have the realization, I always say I like Bethesda games because they're
3635160	3639960	buggy and glitchy and stuff. I don't think that's the case really. I think I'm kind of tired of
3639960	3644840	their games being so fucking broken. I like that they're quirky sometimes. And that's any game
3644840	3650600	really is quirky, but when your game is fundamentally broken and you're just not fixing
3650600	3657000	it and instead you're coming up with concepts to monetize user-made content, I have a little bit
3657080	3661720	of a problem with that. And that's kind of where I'm at with that, but that's my realization.
3661720	3667080	So I went back to playing the other game I was playing this week, which is Minecraft on
3667080	3672440	PlayStation 4. Just, eh, I just decided I'm going to just play survival for a little bit and so I
3672440	3680120	did that and it was relaxing. Then of course the other stuff I played, I tried the Marvel vs Capcom
3680120	3687560	Infinite demo that they have, the story demo, and I was kind of on the fence with that game
3687560	3692840	as it was. And that demo did not fucking help. I am not purchasing that game.
3693720	3698520	Was not very good at all. The characters are all right. I forgot to get it. The characters are
3698520	3703640	all right, but that demo, it was just, and I get it. It's a story mode, so there's supposed to be
3703640	3708600	cut scenes, but it's just like cut scene, cut scene, cut scene, cut scene, boring ass fight,
3708600	3712600	cut scene. I'm a little worried. I'm a little worried for Capcom. I'm a little worried for
3712600	3718440	Capcom. Granted, Resident Evil 7, people are loving. No, that looks fantastic. But other
3718440	3723640	one than that, I'm a little worried for Capcom right now. It's just, you know, honestly looking
3723640	3728680	at the roster of characters that were going to be in there, it wasn't all that exciting to me
3728680	3734920	that much. I mean, it was, I wanted to check it out and I did, and I'm just not feeling it.
3735880	3741640	I thought Marvel versus Capcom 3 was way better roster wise. It was more interesting characters.
3742760	3748200	And I guess maybe later on down the line, you know, with all the DLC that they'll be pumping
3748200	3752040	out that I'm sure interesting characters will come out, but that's going to be a couple of years from
3752040	3756280	now by the time that, you know, more interesting characters. And by then, I'm just not going to
3756280	3760680	want to play it and I don't want to play it now. So I'm just not going to pick it up. All right.
3761560	3766680	And then of course, you know, mobile wise, I've been playing, you know, my usual Pokemon go and
3766680	3772840	clicker game. I almost, I didn't do it because I saw it came out this week. I almost downloaded
3772840	3779640	Garfield go because that's a thing now. Wait, Garfield go? Garfield go. Yes. It's like a
3779640	3788200	Pokemon go rip off with Garfield and it is absolutely terrible. So you go around, you
3788200	3793480	collect, you gotta find lasagna and avoid normal. No, no, no, no, no, no. You're right.
3793480	3799960	Guess what? So, you know, Pokemon. I mean, yes, I do know how you have to flick the balls at the
3799960	3805240	Pokemon to try to catch them. Yes. And put in Garfield go, you have to flick lasagna into
3805240	3810760	Garfield's dish and they have the whole AR shit and everything. And you collect and you go around
3810760	3815560	and you find comic books, like old comic book panels that they have and stuff. And on top of
3815560	3820920	that though, apparently you can win actual like real money prizes, like gift cards and crap.
3820920	3823800	But I mean, come on, honestly, you're never going to be able to do that because they're going to
3823800	3828840	have somehow limited, but yes, that's Garfield go. It looks like such a, I'm going, I'm going,
3828840	3835560	I'm going balls deep on Garfield go. Let's do this. Let's do a tournament. It is fucking on
3835560	3842520	Garfield go motherfuckers. This is the next big thing in gaming. It's an e-sport.
3843480	3847000	It is. So that's it. That was my week.
3849000	3852760	Misty care to follow that up. How was your gaming week? Maybe you can play some Garfield go on the
3852760	3859880	trains as you're heading, heading back East. He's she's got it up on her phone. I love it.
3859880	3865560	I need to investigate how bad it is. I'm telling you, I'm telling you. It is on. It is on. All
3865560	3868760	right. Uh, Misty, how was, uh, how was your gaming week? What have you been up to?
3869640	3874760	Mm, considering being in transit half the time, mostly Pokemon go. I mean,
3874760	3880120	where the hell did my nickname come from after all? Right. You are the leader of the water gym.
3881640	3887320	But, but yes, I did. I did end up at round one, so pretty much any games you can find there.
3888120	3894760	Notable exceptions of the project diva game that I seem to remember seeing and two DX.
3895400	3899720	I mainly concentrated on pop and music and, and of course DDR.
3901480	3906680	Uh, what about, uh, our trip to, uh, stars yesterday? I thought you, you would, uh,
3906680	3911080	because you got to play you beat and what else we played DDR. We played around a DDR together.
3911800	3916280	Yes, we did. And you watched me pass Orion seven, eight, which was a nine footer back in the day,
3916280	3920680	but at some point they gave it more feet. It's a 12 footer now. And my old man asked past that.
3920760	3924840	Thank you very much. I'm going to be that 40 year old DDR player up on the machine.
3925720	3928840	Not giving a fuck that the other people playing are old enough to be my kids.
3929720	3934200	Hey, at least your old man ass doesn't have an doesn't have any knee problems that I know of.
3934200	3938040	That's why my ass has been sticking to beginner jumps off.
3940040	3941880	All right. Anything else for gaming week you want to share?
3943720	3949560	I did do a few songs of obligatory step mania on a train, but that's all I'm thinking of off hand.
3950680	3956680	Alright. Um, my gaming week, I will talk about, uh, so I went to the arcade with Misty and played
3956680	3961960	some more neon FM, which I'm, I'm enjoying. Uh, and as you play in the arcade, you rake up a bunch
3961960	3966440	of credits that you can use on the phone to play songs for free. So that part's if you log into
3966440	3970200	the game. So don't forget, like if you are interested in neon FM, like make an account
3970200	3975000	and log in cause you get free, uh, currency stuff when you play in the arcade. So don't forget that.
3975000	3979240	Uh, and I've been enjoying that, but otherwise, uh, big stuff that I've been playing this week.
3979720	3985880	I have, um, been checking out the newest final fantasy 14 expansion that had its soft launch
3985880	3992680	on Friday or the early access. I guess the official launch is not until Monday or Tuesday,
3992680	3997400	but the early access launch was on Friday and I'm not going to lie. It's it, it, it was a
3997400	4004600	fucking mess and a little bit of an embarrassment for Square Enix, how bad they kind of screwed up,
4005160	4010200	the launch of storm blood. Because, um, what happened basically is that in the main story
4010200	4014280	quest, when you want to progress characters, you know, past level 60 to level 70 and experience
4014280	4020520	the new story, everything got, um, held up where there is this, um, scene that you had to play what
4020520	4025240	they call a solo instance where you do a fight by yourself, basically, uh, that's similar to a
4025240	4028440	dungeon, but it's like a solo experience. And what was happening is that so many people were hitting
4028440	4034520	it that the servers couldn't handle it. And so maybe like one person out of the thousands that
4034520	4039560	were trying to get in would get in at a time. And so so many people could not progress the story.
4039560	4043560	And I was actually streaming this on my Twitch. You can see it actually happened to me towards the end
4043560	4047880	of the stream that I was doing for two and a half hours. But, um, it was, it was pretty rotten that
4047880	4055000	that went on for over two days after the launch and then they finally fixed it overnight. So now
4055000	4061000	that I'm past that, the game's fantastic. Like the story is great. And some of the cut scenes
4061000	4065560	so far have made me go like they've been like really like twisting and turning and that stuff.
4065560	4070440	So, you know, now that I'm past all that, it's, it's fantastic. But, um, that was very, very
4070440	4076680	disappointing, uh, that they did not like pull the servers down sooner to try to fix it or do any
4076680	4083400	sort of testing whatsoever. It was a little bit of a black mark. Um, but otherwise now that I think
4083400	4087720	we're past it, it's probably one of those things everybody will forget in a few weeks because I'm
4087720	4091800	sure the story and the expansion is good enough and strong enough to really carry the game.
4091800	4098680	But I just feel like the creators of said story and said game did not deserve how screwed they
4098680	4103720	got by those network issues. But that also is partially in the design of what were they thinking
4103720	4108120	funneling all these people through a solo instance so early on, you know, they should have done it
4108120	4112120	later in the story when people are getting there at different times. It was a little,
4112120	4117160	it was a bad, bad decision on Square's part. But anyway, it's fine now. And that's the important
4117160	4122600	part, I suppose. Um, during some of the downtime, I finally, I was on my PlayStation four and I was
4122600	4125880	just kind of catching up on some of the backlog. So I checked out this free to play game. I
4125880	4130680	downloaded a while ago called paladins. Have you heard of this? Yes, I have. And I've actually,
4130680	4135720	they're overwatchy. I kind of wanted to try it because it looked all right. I mean, it granted,
4135720	4140040	it looks like kind of a rip off of Overwatch, but a lot of people are playing it. Yeah, it's,
4140040	4146840	it's, uh, it's definitely in, I mean, it's hard to say because, you know, it's inspired. I mean,
4146840	4151960	granted, this game had to have been in development long before Overwatch was out. Like it takes too
4151960	4156760	much to make a video game, but I'm sorry when I look at that and some of the abilities that some
4156760	4161560	of the people have and like, like seriously, the tank in paladins like had a fucking Reinhardt
4161560	4164840	shield from like, I just like it, there was a little curve shield and everything. And I'm like,
4164840	4169560	some of these abilities I think are kind of like right out of Overwatch, but keep in mind,
4170120	4173560	shield designs tend to be fairly universal for the type of shield. That's true. And who knows,
4173560	4178040	you know, and this could all be borrowed from team forgers two, which I didn't really play enough of
4178040	4182520	to be fair. I mean, mercy is a lot like the medic in team forgers two. So it's not like these games
4182520	4186600	haven't borrowed from each other before. And you know, um, I enjoyed what I played at paladins.
4186600	4191560	There's a lot to explore in the free to play currency, uh, because you can't play every
4191560	4195880	character right out the gate and they just hate them out. Yeah. And there's also like, there's
4195880	4200040	these, there's these cards that look like magic cards that could actually change abilities. And
4200040	4203720	that's something that to be fair, Overwatch doesn't really have, you can't really like
4204920	4209320	alter your abilities on the characters through some of the loot that you get.
4209320	4216200	So there are some very different things that paladin's doing, but you know, it's a calling it
4216760	4222200	an Overwatch inspired game is not a bad way to think about it. If like, is this a game I want
4222200	4227720	to get into or not? So, um, stopping and chat says, I want to try it, but I hear it has a lot
4227720	4232760	of grinding and too much pay to win. And well, it's free to try. And I just, I went in and did
4232760	4236600	some AI matches and I was like, Oh, this is all right. This is, this is fun. This is a good time
4236600	4241560	waster. So I don't think I'm going to sit there and drop 50 bucks on it, but I can see why people
4241560	4246680	get into it. It actually, actually, I would say to be fair, especially in the art style,
4246680	4251400	it does remind me more of team fortress two in a lot of ways, even than it does Overwatch.
4251400	4257000	So, you know, which is what both games really probably just can't come up with a team fortress
4257000	4264200	three. They're allergic to three. Anyway. Um, one other thing I want to give a quick shout out to
4264200	4268680	is, uh, he was in chat earlier, but I guess he left at some point, but my buddy Gabe from
4268680	4274440	nascent games, uh, did a little show and tell for, uh, crumple, which is like super duper close to
4274440	4279400	getting released, I guess now at this point. And, uh, so I got to, I played it on Amazon fire.
4279400	4282360	Cause I wanted to see what it was like on the tablet. Cause you know, I'd seen it,
4282360	4286040	I'd played it before when he had it on a PC at one of those gaming shows.
4286040	4291160	I tried it on a tablet and, um, yeah, I mean, I'm excited for him for the game to finally launch.
4291160	4295320	So congrats to him. Uh, I guess it is finally coming out next month, but there are a couple
4295320	4299400	other things he's, you know, I gave him some feedback on how I felt about his finished product.
4299400	4302520	And I think there are a couple of things he's thinking about implementing over the next month.
4302520	4306440	So that'll be out very soon. And it gave me an opportunity to check out that space.
4306440	4309560	Remember when him and Bree were here last time they were talking about like the square one,
4309560	4315160	which is like, it's like not to give away where I live, but it's like just down the street is not
4315160	4319480	that far from here at all. So I was, I was pleasantly surprised by that and they've got
4319480	4324680	a nice little thing going there. So, um, I'm very happy for them. It's like, it's like going into
4324680	4330840	like a shared office space, but it's, it's very hip. I don't know how else to describe it. Cause
4330840	4336200	I only got to see the, the, I haven't, I haven't worked there. I've only experienced the, uh,
4336200	4342280	little media event he had there. So, but it's, it's, it's like, it's like they took a converted
4342280	4347400	office basically, and they're converting it to this, you know, this office is for NASA and games,
4347400	4351960	this office is for somebody else who wants to rent it. And there's these other spaces where people
4351960	4356040	can, you know, collaborate and do stuff too. And there's a little classroom in the back where they
4356040	4360360	can do like, you know, their, um, development panels and things that they do. Yeah. They're
4360440	4365000	aggressive. I feel like when we have, I'll let them explain it better. Next time we either have
4365000	4368360	him or Brie back on the show, we'll let them explain it better probably than I can do,
4368360	4372760	but it was just, it was nice to go there and see the growing game development scene in Sacramento
4372760	4377720	is always a pleasant thing. So it was very happy to do that. So, and I see Brie is actually in
4377720	4381080	chat tonight and gave me a heart. So thank you very much. Heart's right back at you.
4381800	4386680	All right. Uh, let's, um, move on. I think that's, uh, that's really all I have to say
4386680	4393000	about my gaming week. Um, yeah, so we got news to cover other stuff besides just E3 and 15
4393000	4399800	years and gave me weeks. So Loki start us off, please. Yes. Um, so IO interactive has finally
4399800	4406360	left, um, square Enix. They, you know, basically said that, you know, Hey, we're, we're independent
4406360	4414680	now. Um, and the best part about it is they also are keeping the rights to hit man. So that is
4414680	4418840	still their franchise, which is kind of cause you see sometimes, you know, when these companies get
4418840	4423240	bought by other companies that, you know, they don't retain the rights to some of those games
4423240	4428600	and then the new owner hangs onto it for all time, never to do anything with it. Yeah. Yeah.
4429480	4433320	So it is nice to see that, you know, they're going to be able to do their own thing,
4433320	4439000	maybe with another, um, you know, publishing partner. So yeah, I mean, that's pretty cool.
4439000	4444680	And he said, you know, it's 19 year history IO interactive has, um, you know, brought out lots
4444680	4448840	of different games. And they said that, you know, from many ninjas, the freedom fighters,
4448840	4457640	and of course, Kane and Lynch and agent 47 and hit man. So, um, you know, they've, I don't know,
4457640	4460920	they're going to be independent now. So it'd be cool to see what they're going to be working on
4460920	4464840	next. Well, since you're very anti publisher tonight, Loki, this should be good news for them,
4464840	4468040	right? Cause now they'll be able to do whatever the fuck they want. Nice to have flexibility
4468040	4471160	about what, you know, where you're going to publish with and they don't have to do their
4471160	4475640	game episodic if they don't like, although, although people didn't seem to dislike that
4475640	4481480	for hit man. So maybe they'll keep it. Who knows? Yeah, that'd be interesting. So I'm curious to
4481480	4486680	see what happens in the future with them. So at E3, a lot of people were talking about the
4486680	4490840	Minecraft 4k, right? But then the other announcement that Minecraft was going to be
4490840	4494680	cross platform and they actually had the, the switch was in there and it was going to be
4494760	4499320	cross platform across the tablets, PC switch, all that stuff. But you know what was missing y'all
4499320	4507240	was Sony PlayStation and uh, yeah. Um, apparently Microsoft was trying to talk to Sony about it.
4507240	4511480	And uh, let's see, there was a tweet from Minecraft spokesperson Aubrey Norris, uh,
4511480	4517800	over on Twitter. Wasn't she with, uh, yeah. THQ. She was with Devolver 1.1. She, um, I don't
4517800	4521880	remember if she was a Devolver, but I know she's a THQ. She, we, we used to get emails from her
4521880	4526440	all the time. I met her at 1E3. Um, and um, cause I just remember her doing a lot of like
4526440	4532040	the volition stuff. Yes, it was volition. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It was THQ. That's it. That's
4532040	4537480	it. Okay. And uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat follows that up. She was never a Devolver. She was a THQ
4537480	4541960	and volition. Sorry. My bad. My bad. My bad. I can't, I can't, I, these companies probably
4541960	4545480	can't keep their own personnel straight. Let alone me. So anyway, but I, I just remember
4545480	4549080	the name sounded very familiar to you cause she wrote the most hilarious emails to promote all
4549160	4554040	this stuff. She's very good at getting attention, but anyway, best in PR now she's Minecraft,
4554040	4557560	which you know, is obviously that, uh, that franchise. And she went on Twitter and said,
4557560	4562040	we'd love to have PlayStation players along with the unified Minecraft hope that we can.
4562040	4567240	So apparently this went on to the fact that this is something that PlayStation is pushing back on
4567240	4572840	a little bit. And this is a little bit true with rocket league as well. And a Eurogamer actually
4572840	4576920	did an interview with Jim Ryan, whose PlayStation global sales and marketing had to say,
4577480	4582120	Minecraft's got this rocket league's got this. What's going on as Sony not playing ball.
4582120	4586680	Jim Ryan said, it's certainly not a profound philosophy stance we have against this philosophical
4586680	4590920	stance. Excuse me. We've done it in the past. We're always open to conversations with any
4590920	4594600	developer or publisher who wants to talk about it. Unfortunately, it's a commercial discussion
4594600	4597960	between ourselves and other stakeholders. And I'm not going to get into the detail
4597960	4600920	of that on this particular instance. And I can see your eyes rolling.
4600920	4607240	And then a Eurogamer went on to clarify that, you know, obviously they're upset. They want to
4607240	4611160	play with switch owners and so forth. And Jim Ryan continued, we've got to be mindful of our
4611160	4615400	responsibility to our install base Minecraft, the demographic playing that, you know, as well as I
4615400	4620440	do, it's all ages, but also very young. We have a contract with the people who go online with us
4620440	4624840	that we look after them and they are within the PlayStation curated universe exposing what in
4624840	4628920	many cases are children to external influences. We have no ability to manage or look after.
4628920	4632760	It's something we have to think about very carefully. So, what I'm taking away from this
4632760	4639560	is that he's saying basically, if a child were to go into a match or whatever with a Microsoft
4639560	4647080	player and that Microsoft player draws penises out of Minecraft blocks, then heaven forbid that child
4647080	4656200	saw a digital penis and it was Microsoft that enabled said penising and not Sony because Sony
4656200	4661320	would have been unable to police that because Sony police is so much on their network as it is.
4662600	4666360	That's kind of what I took away from it. But then you go, okay, there's a part of me that said,
4666360	4671080	all right, well, what is cross-play on Sony? Final Fantasy 14 is obviously the first one that comes
4671080	4678520	to mind for me. If you want to go further back, Final Fantasy 11 was huge because that was
4678520	4685480	Microsoft, Sony and PC, 360, PlayStation 2 and PC. We're all in on that. But then I kind of go,
4685480	4692440	well, okay, but Square Run uses its own game masters. And so there's GMs that, you know,
4692440	4696040	can moderate this type of stuff. So I guess, okay, it is a little different. But what about Street
4696040	4700200	Fighter V? What about Street Fighter V? That's the other big cross-play thing I think of. There's no
4700200	4704840	GMs in that. Is that just because kids don't play Street Fighter or because Street Fighter is an
4704840	4709240	M-rated game? I don't think it's their excuses why, you know, I don't think it has anything to
4709240	4716120	do with kids. So, like, I don't remember, like, back last year when they made the announcement,
4716120	4720200	who made the announcement about cross-platform. And it was actually Microsoft saying that they're
4720200	4726120	going to allow Xbox gamers to play against PlayStation 4 and PC players. But I don't think,
4726120	4729880	and then Sony, of course, responded back to that saying, well, PlayStation has been supporting
4729880	4736280	cross-platform play between PC and on several software titles, including Final Fantasy 11 on
4736280	4741160	PlayStation 2 and PC back in 2002. It's like, ha-ha, we did it first. Of course, they were
4741160	4746760	saying, you know, we would be happy to have the conversation with any publisher or developers who
4746760	4753640	are interested in cross-platform play. That was last year. This year, probably because they're,
4754440	4758440	as Bobby put, so ahead of the game, there's nothing really for them to gain on this.
4758440	4764680	Aside from disappointing, you know, people that do, like, you and me, like, and most, like,
4764680	4770200	gamers out there, dude, we're not your fucking company, okay? For us, you know, to lose the
4770200	4774680	ability to play with our friends on different platforms is kind of a disappointment. I get it,
4774680	4778600	you're company, and this is, like, an advantage for you because you're ahead of the game. But
4778600	4784200	that shit shifts all the time. It's still disappointing that you're being petty about this.
4784200	4790440	If you want to talk 2006 E3 for a minute, those were very different times when Sony would have
4790440	4796680	begged for this sort of thing. So, don't get cocky, y'all, haven't we? Ask Rap Rabbit about
4796680	4803480	that one. I just, I'm surprised, like, I get it. It's about business and about the bottom line,
4803480	4807480	but, like, can't these companies come together and say, hey, you know what? This is a cool idea.
4807480	4811640	Let's see if we can implement cross-platform play amongst all these different platforms
4811640	4816680	so that we can benefit the players. But, oh, fuck that. No, money, money. I need my money.
4817400	4822840	Pay for that PlayStation Plus and the Xbox Live. If I were to take Jim Brian at face value on what
4822840	4829000	he's saying here, then I would think this could be solved as follows. Don't let the PlayStation
4829000	4834600	people play with Xbox or Switch or any of the other stuff until they acknowledge a disclaimer
4834600	4841000	that says you are leaving the PlayStation Network and Sony does not moderate and cannot be held
4841000	4845640	liable for what you're about to see or whatever that. Or restrict it to 18 and up if you want.
4845640	4850680	Don't let accounts with birthdays prior to whatever's 18 up. Don't let him use it. Lock
4850680	4855080	the under 18 crowd out. Sorry, but, you know, if that's what it's going to take to get the
4855080	4859640	rest of us on board, then do it. All of like any game that has online says, you know, online,
4859640	4865560	the online portion is unrated. It's not rated by the ESRB. So you may see dicks. I mean,
4865560	4872120	that's warning dicks. Ahoy. How boring.
4875320	4879240	That's that's all we need is everybody's getting into the, you know, the pirate game,
4879240	4883160	you know, thing that's the new popular thing. That's the devolver digital tie right there.
4883160	4892680	Dicks Ahoy! I can see it now. Isn't that like a porn star's name? Dixie Hoy. If not,
4892760	4895400	that should be a drag queen's name. Dixie Hoy.
4899080	4906040	Patent pending. Trademark. I'm sure that there's got to be a Dixie Wrecked. I'm sure that's
4906040	4912360	well, I know there's also Dixie Normous. So I did see like kind of on tangent here,
4912360	4917480	since we're talking about weird names for things, I did see that someone has used the power of
4918040	4923720	machine learning to name guinea pigs. And so this machine can look at a guinea pig
4923720	4927640	and come up with a name. Why is it anyway? Can't do that for babies?
4928760	4932440	Well, yeah, I guess you could. I mean, if you want to name them gerbil names or whatever,
4932440	4936920	or like hamster names or guinea pig names, whatever. But like, why can't we be using
4936920	4942040	machine learning for like naming drag queens? I mean, or porn stars or really anything.
4942040	4947160	I'm pretty sure for some season of Drag Race, Logo TV had, well, we already have a machine.
4948120	4954200	It's the name of your first pet plus the street you grew up on is your drag queen name.
4954920	4958040	That's also a way to get people's security questions.
4958040	4960200	That's right. So you got to be careful what you post on Facebook. That's why I'm not going
4960200	4964360	to answer that question here on OLR. But yeah, sometimes those things are little tricks. But
4964360	4970760	anyway, moving on. Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
4971640	4979880	Well, this, you know, I'm gonna say right now, this might sound really weird to at least those
4979880	4986520	of us, at least in America, where it's illegal to do something like this. But Konami has been,
4986520	4993320	well, the report is that they are allegedly blacklisting their ex employees in the Japanese
4993320	4999240	video game industry. So basically, the ones in particular that they're targeting are people that
4999320	5010280	worked for Kojima Productions. What it was actually printed in Nikkei Asian Review, that
5011880	5020440	there was a Kojima Productions executive who applied for Kojima to join ITS Kenpo, which is
5021400	5025560	an insurance company that focuses on the gaming industry and the application was denied
5026280	5033240	because the the chair of that company's board is also a board member at Konami.
5033800	5046280	It's Kimihiko Higashio. So there's a lot of evidence, but it's not confirmed. But
5048200	5053000	and of course, it was asked of Konami US and there was no reply.
5053000	5060440	Well, the US is also different rules anyway. So it's likely that if this is true, and we should
5060440	5065640	say allegedly, well, there's all Japan. There's another quote in here from the article from Nikkei
5065640	5073000	Asian Review is that they have, they're apparently not allowed to put their Konami experience on
5073000	5078120	their public resume. And it was quoted saying, if you leave the company, you cannot reply,
5079000	5084600	on Konami's name to land a job. Well, to be there with my LinkedIn profile.
5085400	5091880	And if an ex-Konami employee is interviewed by the media, the company will send them a letter
5091880	5097880	through a legal representative about whatever they say about it. So take it as you will.
5097880	5100600	So this is to stop people from bad mouthing it, basically.
5100600	5104520	Exactly. Which, of course, we know here in the US, highly illegal.
5104520	5110360	Right. So you're really not trying that hard not to be dicks, right?
5112360	5118920	All right. It's my how the mighty have fallen. Bobby Black Wolf chat asks,
5118920	5122840	is Konami run by the Yakuza now? Like seriously, serious question. Is it?
5126120	5133560	Probably not. But I wouldn't be surprised. I know. Right. It's sad. It's sad.
5133560	5137720	Moving on. Happy Loki, right? Or more sad. More sad?
5137720	5148440	More sad. So there was a Rockstar had sent a cease and desist to modding software called Open 4.
5148440	5153320	And Open 4 has been around forever since, you know, for being grand theft out of four
5153320	5160200	is one of the pieces of software that I used at one time to unarchive some other files and stuff
5160200	5165400	and, you know, help mod the game and everything. And, you know, this has been around for like 10
5165400	5172680	years now and people use it for a lot of things. Now, currently Open 4 is closed software, so you
5172680	5179080	can't like really see the code for it. And they were putting things in place where if you were
5179080	5186680	using Open 4, you wouldn't be able to mod online. It was mainly for offline purposes. You could
5187480	5192920	use it to, you know, change out models and stuff like that. And so really kind of benign stuff.
5192920	5201480	But nonetheless, they went ahead and put it out there. And I guess Take 2 has followed up with
5201480	5207720	this because people are not happy one bit about it because you're essentially killing, you know,
5207720	5212120	single-player modding. And so they said, you know, Take 2's actions were not specifically
5212120	5217240	targeting single-player mods. Unfortunately, Open 4 enables recent malicious mods that allow
5217240	5223400	harassment of players and airfield grand theft auto online experiences for everybody. We're
5223400	5228280	working to figure out a way we can continue to support the creative community without negatively
5228280	5233640	impacting our players, which is a big fucking line of bullshit because it does not work online.
5233640	5241240	There's no way to use it for online modding, period. So that is a bunch of bullshit. And to
5241240	5247400	go along with that, you know, once again, GoodNTS, the guy that actually made the software,
5247400	5255640	he's responded to it as well, saying, you know, Open 4, Liberty City, and GTA 5, and all other
5255640	5262680	mods slash projects from my team and me are only specific for single-player. Rockstar must be aware
5262680	5269160	about the fact that you cannot access GTA Online while you have installed any Open 4 mod. And he
5269160	5274200	even posted a screenshot, basically says, alert, you are attempting to access GTA Online servers
5274200	5279320	with an altered version of the game returning to Grand Theft Auto 5. It literally blocks you from
5279320	5285080	playing online. This is a statement, unfortunately, Open 4 enables recent malicious mods that allow
5285080	5289720	harassment of players and airfield grand theft auto online experiences for everybody. It's just
5289720	5296920	wrong and they know it. Open 4 does not allow or support any kind of GTA Online mods. We always
5296920	5302920	supported Rockstar in their right to protect GTA Online from hacks and cheats, but Take-Two C and D
5302920	5308760	was specific for our single-player mods and have no mentions about Grand Theft Auto Online.
5309320	5315880	Then on top of that, not only were they forced to take stuff down, but actually there was some
5315880	5322760	other C synthesis for actual Grand Theft Auto Online mods. So one of those was Forks Hacks,
5322760	5328360	which is a mod menu that you can use in Grand Theft Auto Online that actually required a $15
5328360	5336360	a month fee to access it. And what's kind of funny with that is basically they were, it says,
5336360	5340360	after discussions with Take-Two Interactive, effective immediately, we are ceasing all
5340360	5345080	maintenance, development, and distribution of the Forks Hacks cheap menu service. We will be donating
5345080	5350200	our proceeds to charity and we apologize for all problems, Forks Hacks services of cost to the
5350200	5355400	Grand Theft Auto community. So they are kind of cleaning the house along with that lexicon and
5355400	5361800	menu tools have also been posted statements basically receiving a C synthesis as well.
5361800	5366200	So yes, it sucks. I mean, it's good that they're getting rid of those online mod menus because
5366200	5370920	that's really where the problems are coming from. It sucks that they're targeting Open 4 because
5370920	5377160	that really is not part of this. Their thought is because draw in, and honestly it was one of
5377160	5382040	the reasons I purchased Grand Theft Auto for the third time. Grand Theft Auto 5 for the third time
5382040	5387640	on my third console. No more giving me shit about Mass Effect 3. For the third time on PCB because
5387640	5392520	it was for modding because I wanted to mod the game and that was one of the reasons. Now they
5392520	5399640	have basically stolen that from me, which is ridiculous. And I mean, I don't know, we'll find
5399640	5404600	a way around it, I'm sure, but it's still annoying that they would punish players like that because
5404600	5411080	I think what it comes down to, as this is the head of Take-Two said before, they see the player
5411080	5416280	base as more wood to be chopped. Whereas basically those people that bought the game and are spending
5416280	5420680	a lot of their time offline playing with mods, if you want all that creative stuff that you were
5420680	5428040	able to do with modding, now you better go out to play online and buy those shark cards so that you
5428040	5432280	can buy all this content. That's kind of what's keeping me offline a lot because of this whole
5432840	5439800	pay-the-win stuff. I want to go to chat because there's a lot of comments from this here in chat.
5439800	5443720	Dungeonbuster in chat says, Steam rankings for Grand Theft Auto 5 are torn down by a lot of
5443720	5448840	angry reviewers. From what I understand, the mod tool took a lot of pains to avoid the problems
5448840	5453720	the Cease and Desist accused it of. Tigerclaw in chat says, I wonder how this will affect a Grand
5453720	5458040	Theft Auto 5 community that does Grand Theft Auto 5 RPs. There's a community that role plays in
5458040	5461240	Grand Theft Auto 5 using a mod so they can play as cops. Yeah, you're probably not gonna be able to
5461240	5465000	do it anymore. That sucks. Yeah, it does suck because that was really benign stuff that they
5465000	5469400	had and it was just changing. They want to charge for it like Bethesda is. Well, here's what it was
5469400	5473240	is they were just playing with like different modifications that weren't necessarily affecting
5473240	5477640	online. A lot of it was just like model swaps like you're taking their generic police car and
5477640	5483080	replacing with a real police car model. Who gives a shit? No, it's not affecting anybody else except
5483080	5490040	the player that's actually using the mod and so it's just sad that they, I think that they,
5490040	5494920	they're gonna play dumb and pretend like, oh well, you know, I guess the excuse might be,
5494920	5499640	well someone hacked it and they modded it so that it works online. Okay, well that's not,
5500440	5507720	you of all people, take two, should fucking know about how someone hacked something and
5507720	5513240	it's not representative of the actual product. Hello cop, you know, hot coffee mod anyone?
5513880	5518920	I mean shit, I mean you have that stuff disabled but someone hacked it and then they accessed it
5519400	5525000	and so that's not representative of what the final product was. I mean come on, you understand what
5525000	5530600	it is and like they went out more than I think fair out of their way to try to prevent any sort
5530600	5534440	of this nonsense and then they're still getting punished for it and I think it's because of
5534440	5540120	fucking greed. It's because once again they want you to pay for those because Grand Theft Auto
5540120	5547080	Online is making a ton of money and they feel and they even fucking boldly just, just, just
5547080	5552040	bragged about it. Just like we think that we can get more money that people aren't paying enough
5552040	5556040	on Grand Theft Auto Online. We want you, we're just gonna go get that wood shop.
5556040	5556760	Wow.
5556760	5558760	It's, it's fucking sick.
5558760	5564200	All right, well I'm gonna move on for time's sake but wow, that's a pretty bold move. Let's talk
5564200	5567640	about, let's, now finally I have some good news because I know everybody wants to go
5568200	5572600	to Super Nintendo Land when it opens up at Universal Studios. Yay theme park news,
5572600	5577560	yay theme parks make it all better. Well apparently some information already hitting
5577560	5583560	out on the internet. Some leaked information about the Orlando Park and what Super Nintendo
5583560	5590040	Land is supposed to look like. Now keep in mind it could be fake but I don't know it looks.
5590040	5591560	They have the trailer for the Japanese.
5591560	5594360	Yeah, they have the trailer for the Japanese one so we, you know, there are some things out there
5594360	5599960	that are legit but anyway apparently a Mario Kart ride is happening. That is part of it which
5599960	5606040	seems so obvious doesn't it? I just hope I can blue shell my friends. That's just what I hope
5606040	5611560	is a part of it. But anyway, also there might be Kirby areas and Zelda areas. There's a Kirby Kids
5611560	5618280	Playland, a Donkey Kong Island, a Zelda Kingdom, and a Super Mario World ride which I assume is,
5618280	5624760	is part of the, where the Mario Kart thing is. For those familiar with Universal Studios Orlando,
5624760	5628920	I've never been there. I only know the one in Hollywood but it's right by the Simpsons ride
5628920	5631080	where they're building it. It's right on the other side of that.
5631080	5634200	I mean it's all right but it sounds like the Kirby Land really sucks.
5635720	5639480	I think that's a pun. Act Def, Act Def put it down. I think, I think, I think that was just a pun.
5641000	5646520	So anyway, yeah, I, hey, I'm all for, I can't wait for this to come out. I want to, I want to go,
5646520	5651880	I want to go there. I really do. Act Def in chat says, Kirby area, when are we going?
5653800	5657080	Let's see, Dungeon Buster in chat says, if the Zelda Kingdom has a ride as awesome as
5657080	5663800	Gringotts bank ride, I'm there. It looks like the Mario ride is the biggest one.
5663800	5667400	I don't even think Zelda has a ride. It looks like more of the photo opportunities, but you never
5667400	5671880	know. We'll, we'll see. We'll see what they build there. Because if you think about it, they did do
5671880	5676200	that expansion in Orlando and they just opened in Hollywood. So I finally went there. The Harry
5676200	5683160	Potter area expanded. And I got to say that ride is fucking magical. Like that, that, the Forbidden
5683160	5687480	Journey or whatever that ride is called the one that's like, uh, it's like half roller coaster,
5687480	5691960	half in front of screens and stuff. That ride is fucking magical. Like I, I really enjoyed that
5691960	5696200	ride, but they have, so that's like the highlight. That's like the thing you have to fucking do if
5696200	5700360	you go to Harry Potter world. Um, but then they also have like a little roller coaster that's,
5700360	5704840	Oh, okay. It's cute. And that's like it. So they opened this whole Harry Potter world to open up
5704840	5711000	shops, things that look like Harry Potter world to sell butter beer. So you can expect that there's
5711000	5714840	going to be a lot of that when Nintendo as well, a lot of it is going to be to sell you Nintendo
5714840	5719560	merchandise. I'm sure plenty of you are going to be okay with that. The shroom market. There's
5719560	5724840	a fan. That's right. That's right. Who knows what, what food and drink, but they're not telling you
5724840	5729800	though, unfortunately is that super Mario world or a super Nintendo land or whatever. It's actually
5729800	5735400	based off of the super Mario brothers movie. And so it's all post-apocalyptic with like crappy
5735400	5740600	fungus everywhere. And, and like tiny did universal put out that movie? I don't think
5740600	5743880	they did. I don't think universal was a studio behind that movie. I feel like it was new line
5743880	5750280	or somebody else. It was probably new line. All right. Anyway, let's move on. Uh, dark soccer.
5750280	5752600	What do you have for us before we get to the classic game of the week soon?
5753160	5760200	Well, um, they have confirmed a prequel for life is strange. They've, uh, confirmed a three part
5761000	5768680	prequel. Um, and it will be called, uh, before the storm. And it was actually confirmed by
5768680	5775640	Ashley Burch, who played Chloe, that she will not be, uh, uh, reprising her role
5775640	5788920	because the sag afters after a strike. So, um, she, um, but she apparently was consulted about
5788920	5797000	the, the role anyway. So, um, it should be interesting. I hope that, you know, there is a
5797000	5803640	good voice actor, but still, I think it's really shady for them going around the guild. You know,
5803640	5808920	when this strike is there for improving the conditions of voice actors.
5809480	5813560	I have heard there's some more progress, like just in this last week that there's progress being
5813560	5816680	made at the strike that I guess they're going to sit down at the table again and hopefully
5816680	5821640	fucking resolve this already. But yeah, I mean, now, I mean, we all said when the strike first
5821640	5825960	started, you're not going to feel it now, but you're going to fit these games in production.
5825960	5830120	You're going to start to feel it later on. And so now, now we're starting to see it a little bit.
5830120	5838600	So I just hope that perception of, Oh, nothing's changed. Hasn't like been the cause of this going
5838600	5843400	on so long, but I think some independent, like some studios have kind of independently kind of
5843400	5846760	like it's this whole strike is very strange because like, I think some studios have like
5846760	5851400	independently met the needs. And so they're like, okay, but others aren't. And it's very,
5851400	5857320	it's very fragmented right now. But it's just so irritating that there are still studios out there
5857320	5863480	who are looking for voice actors who aren't yet in the guild. Cause it takes a lot to get
5863480	5870600	into the screen actors guild. And the fact that they're looking for people who may be,
5870600	5876280	who may be willing to work in those conditions for a lesser amount of money, you know,
5876280	5882200	it damages all the attempts being made by the screen, by the voice actors. It's really,
5882920	5886520	and these companies that are doing it know full well that they're harming these people.
5887080	5894760	So I hope this isn't the case. I hope it's just a contract issue, but I still, I still have little
5894760	5903160	respect for anyone who's going to. I have, I'll say I don't have respect for the action
5903720	5907960	of anything that would harm the goal of SAG-AFTRA.
5907960	5914120	Sure. And we have, we have friends of the show. Y'all know miss Marissa is in that industry and,
5914120	5917160	you know, has hopefully given a voice to that side of it here on the show.
5917160	5918200	Yeah. We're going to have her back.
5919000	5922440	We do. And Marissa is very talented.
5922440	5926840	Yes, she is. Yes. Yes. Uh, anyway, I got to go to this follow-up comment and chat over
5926840	5930920	at live.vognetware.com to the Mario brothers and who made the movie. Tiger class says the
5930920	5935400	super Mario brothers movie was made by Hollywood pictures and distributed by Buena Vista pictures,
5935400	5939880	distribution, ink, Hollywood pictures. If I remember is owned by Disney. And I,
5939880	5944520	I recall that as well. So no wonder they went to the other place in Orlando.
5946840	5951240	No wonder they were like Disney. Nah, I'm good. We'll go to, we'll go. We'll go to the other place.
5951240	5952440	Thanks. See ya.
5955000	5959560	All right. Loki, what do you have for us before we get to a classic end of the week coming up?
5959560	5965480	As I spoiled earlier in this show, uh, level five has acquired Comcept and they've created
5965480	5971800	a subsidiary now called level five concept. Yes. It's a very unique, um, name. And of course,
5971800	5976520	Comcept, you may remember is releasing a game called mighty number nine, and they have that
5976520	5981000	red Ash something or other game that's coming out. That's, you know, the not mega man legends,
5981000	5985480	but mega man legends, but Hey, we're already starting an anime and the game, and we haven't
5985480	5991720	even put out the one game. And yeah. So, um, level five concept is also working on a game. Actually,
5991720	5995720	their first title is going to be called dragging colonies, which is going to be an iOS and Android
5995720	6002040	title. And that's soon coming out in Japan and 2018, it looks like, and they said it's going
6002040	6009560	to feature dice shaped miniature garden colonies called a colonies and players can build them up.
6009560	6013640	And there's one-on-one honestly, it sounds like every single mobile game that's out there.
6015400	6018760	I've seen a lot of mobile game advertisements having to play this free to play game.
6018760	6023400	Sure. And they all fucking look the same. Like I'm, I know it's a terrible thing. Nothing
6023400	6028920	looks quite like Garth. Nothing. Nothing looks quite like Garfield go Garfield go.
6028920	6036200	And I played like a brief minute of it. That is one janky piece of shit. Like I'm telling you,
6036200	6040840	it's just like that. That was like, Hey, let's cash that shit in.
6042600	6046120	All right. Well, uh, you know, one of the things that's come up a lot lately and even
6046120	6049720	Loki references earlier in the show are the voice chat solutions over on the switch,
6049720	6054040	by the way, somebody did poke Reggie on that. And I don't, I don't have the interview in front of me
6054040	6057720	because it doesn't relate to what I'm about to talk about. But I do recall Reggie saying
6057720	6062760	something similar to what I thought I had mentioned here on OLR, that what we saw that
6062760	6069400	hoary thing, that, uh, thing with the Splatoon, that's just one possible solution. That is not,
6069400	6074440	that's what one third party is doing. That's not the end all only way that's going to work.
6074440	6079080	But Reggie does confirm it will be through an app, but there have been other people that have just
6079080	6083960	kind of said, well, that's kind of what we're doing anyway. We're using Skype or we're using
6083960	6088600	discord, uh, is one thing that's growing a lot with gamers. And, uh, what's interesting about
6088600	6092680	this is that a fan actually asked discord on Twitter, cause that's what we do now these days
6092680	6099160	is tweet people about an app on the Nintendo switch and discord said, we hope so. And they
6099160	6104840	gave a link to a upvote the idea over at a particular link. So discord would love to be
6104840	6109560	involved in the solution over on the Nintendo switch. I don't think it would work because you
6109560	6116040	can't have two apps at the same time. Can you, um, but that's yet to be determined. I think with
6116040	6123400	the switch, you can, well, you can have the shell of the system, the OS and changing the games and
6123400	6128840	all that still runs while you have a game running in the background. So the system is able to
6128840	6134920	multitask. I think more than probably the Wii U was able to, but we don't, we don't know it's
6134920	6140840	full potential yet. I think it's too early to say cause we haven't. Uh, it's a nice idea, but I just,
6140840	6146680	I I'm skeptical now. Tiger class. Is there a discord app on Xbox one and PlayStation four?
6146680	6151240	I don't believe so. So, uh, at least not that I'm aware of is there, if there is,
6151240	6156200	I've never used it. Um, but it's more, I think of it more as a PC slash mobile phone thing is,
6156200	6160920	is where discord is a solution for a lot of things. They don't go with like Skype or something
6160920	6167880	because you would think Skype is well, who owns Skype, Loki, Microsoft. Yeah. So, but no, there's
6167880	6172280	a reason for that because they're talking like cross play for like other, um, games and stuff.
6172280	6177400	I mean, you would think if you, if you use the Skype app, then you're, I have, let's honestly,
6177400	6181000	people are going to find another solution. That's gonna be better than what Nintendo has anyway. So
6181000	6185480	why am I even thinking about this? By the way, speaking of discord, I can, uh, teach you with
6185480	6189480	this a little bit, by the way, uh, Bobby and I were talking earlier this evening and there is
6189480	6193560	going to be a VOG network discord in the very near future. Uh, something that we want to use
6193560	6198360	as more and more of our, um, uh, personalities and shows are growing into the live broadcasting
6198360	6202440	over on Twitch. Um, that not just includes myself, but Bobby and even more people that
6202440	6206680	are getting involved with that, um, as well as having a place, uh, for example,
6206680	6211560	a chat room that's kind of always on, except, uh, like not only on Sunday nights, by the way,
6211560	6215880	IRC is not going anywhere, at least not right. And it's not, not anything we're talking about
6215880	6219160	right now. The IRC is still gonna work the same way it always does for the Sunday night shows.
6219160	6223880	I'm not saying that, but a nice way, for example, maybe if we had a channel on OLR
6223880	6227000	and throughout the week, you might find a story that's like, Hey, I wish you guys would talk
6227000	6230520	about this on the show. We're going to have a place where to kind of collect that information.
6230520	6235160	So that's going to be really exciting. So, uh, I see, I see discord myself as more of like the
6235160	6239880	modern version of the forums because our VOG network forums kind of have tumbleweed rolling
6239880	6246120	through them. Um, so I think discord is going to be a great, uh, uh, I don't want to say replacement,
6246120	6250120	I think a great evolution, let's say of that. So please look forward to it.
6250120	6254040	I was hoping we might be able to unveil that tonight, but I've, and it's my fault. I've been
6254040	6258440	so busy that Bobby and I have been able to coordinate notes on that. So look forward to it
6258440	6264360	soon. Uh, period. Uh, Bobby Blackwolf says technically the IRC is always on all week.
6264360	6268440	Rob just never shows up outside of Sundays. Yeah, I guess it's, it's part of my, partially my fault,
6268440	6272520	but at the same time, um, you know, I think discord is kind of built a little more because
6272520	6276520	it's on your mobile phone to be somewhere that goes with you. Whereas IRC isn't as,
6276520	6280440	I mean, yes, I know there's IRC clients on the phone, but we all know it's not as easy,
6280440	6287160	so it'll be nice. So stay tuned for that. Meanwhile, we're going to take a trip
6287720	6290360	down memory lane with the classic game of the week.
6293160	6296840	Every week, dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,
6296840	6303320	Hey, you ungrateful kids, get off my lawn and go play this video game. Now dark soccer,
6303320	6309160	it is an anniversary show tonight. It is the 15th birthday of OLR tonight. So I expect nothing
6309160	6313320	less than an epic choice for tonight's classic game of the week. Are you, are you going to
6313320	6318040	deliver? It's relatively epic. I think so. I think she picked a good one this week. I think this is
6318040	6321320	a very appropriate choice. After much deliberation. And also you have to consider there's a lot of
6321320	6325080	things she's picked in the past that she didn't want to repeat. Yeah. But this is good. This is
6325080	6328760	a good choice. So dark soccer here on the 15th anniversary of OLR, what'd you pick for the
6328760	6335800	classic game of the week? Pump it up. Yay. Which is not what I originally picked, but after some
6335800	6340360	discussion, it turned out to be the right choice. That's right. For the record, it's never going
6340360	6352760	to be Halo. No Xbox Halo game is going to be classic game. Stop asking. No Xbox Halo game.
6352760	6356520	Honestly, 15 years ago, I would have never thought this would be a classic game of the
6356520	6362920	week, to be honest. So we're making progress. Plus Darian's fucking great. Anyway, pump it up.
6363560	6371480	It's a music game that was developed by Nextcade and published by Andamiro in Korea. And it is a
6371480	6377560	dance game and it's sort of like, I like to think of it as the flip side of DDR and as far as
6377560	6385640	dancing games goes, because it uses the squares that DDR doesn't. It's got five panels. And I
6385640	6389880	mean, it's got doubles play, but you basically have up left, up right, bottom left, bottom right
6389880	6396920	and the center panel. So it really is the flip side of DDR that way. And basically, like DDR,
6396920	6405160	the arrows are synchronized to a rhythm or beat of a chosen song. And you have to step on the
6405160	6415720	arrows the right way. It first came out in South Korea in August of 1999 and has been released in
6415720	6421400	other countries, including all over North America, South America, Europe, you know, I should say
6421400	6428920	continents then. But as far as other versions are concerned, the thing that I thought was kind of
6428920	6434200	neat about it is that it does have the, you know, the I'm falling on my ass help me bar,
6435880	6441160	which is kind of like in the shape of an R on one side and the reverse R the other way,
6441160	6444360	you know, I guess to hold over DDR. But man, that thing hurts when you fall on it.
6446600	6455640	So basically, each of the panels is made of acrylic glass and it's arranged like I described
6455640	6460520	earlier. And so each of these pads is switch activated. When the screen, you know,
6460520	6466040	shows you which one to step on, you step on it while hopefully not looking like you're flailing
6466040	6472200	for your life. Later on, we had the DX version that came out. Those use rear projection televisions
6472200	6479160	for the monitors. And they're definitely a lot cleaner looking. And they also have USB ports
6480120	6489240	after NX2. So you can save your statistics and, you know, and it does have a proprietary USB drive.
6489240	6498200	So moving on, there did have home versions that were released. There was the PC version that came
6498200	6503320	with the version of the dance mat. The arrows are exactly the same size as the arcade, you know,
6504120	6511640	and it connected to the PS2 port and had an adapter so that you could share that with your
6511640	6518680	keyboard. On the international versions, there is a USB plug. Also XSEDE and Xero were released for
6518680	6531160	PSP. In 2004, Andamira released the Korean version of Pump It Up XSEDE for PS2. And it had most of
6531160	6537080	the songs from the arcade XSEDE version. The US version came out in 2005 for Xbox and PlayStation
6537080	6543960	2. Under the name Pump It Up XSEDE and it had most of the songs from the Korean PS2 version and six
6543960	6553320	licensed songs. So there also are, of course, the emulated versions, or I should say simulated
6553320	6560520	versions like Kick It Up, Direct Move, and StepMania. But overall Pump It Up has been
6560520	6569080	really well received. The thing is is that you've got your DDR loyalists and then for a while I was
6569080	6573960	kind of, now the term didn't exist as we know it today, but I think, you know, a few years ago I
6573960	6579400	would have called some of our Pump It Up players as kind of dancing game hipsters. Everyone plays
6579400	6586280	DDR. I'm playing Pump It Up, you know, but at the same time it was really fun. It had a lot of
6586280	6591800	great music and I thought that having the full video playing in the background like it was for
6591800	6596920	a lot of the songs was kind of novel at the time given that we just had the repeating videos like
6596920	6602840	with DDR with the little dancing people over it. In some cases there were even a lot of songs that
6602840	6607080	I thought were a lot better than some of the versions of Pump It Up and it gave us some real
6607080	6613080	classics that, you know, that even today we can't, you know, think of the game without thinking of
6613080	6621560	those songs, you know. Like, I mean, yeah, we had Starion in DDR. It was a crossover, yeah. But we
6621560	6626120	had it in Pump It Up. We had Rent You. We had Funky Tonight which was just playing in the background
6626120	6630120	there. This is Shane's favorite song that we're transitioning into here, Lazenka. Yeah. You know,
6630120	6635080	you can't help but think of that one too, yeah. Just lots of great music and I would even say
6635560	6643080	in my opinion that the difficulty of Pump It Up might even be a little bit harder with DDR,
6643080	6648920	especially I'd say more if you're a DDR player going to Pump It Up and having a lot of experience
6648920	6657720	with it. You know, you kind of have to retrain your feet for it. And so overall, I mean, I think
6657720	6666280	that the game has really stood up. It's emerged as its own, in its own right as opposed to,
6666280	6670520	you know, DDR is the first thing that people think of. But I'd say it's like the Pepsi to
6670520	6676040	DDR's Coke, you know. And a lot of people think that Pepsi is better. I mean, I think Pepsi is
6676040	6682280	better but I'd like DDR better as a game but still, still, still, still. Don't you have 7 Up?
6683240	6690280	Girl, 7 Up is made by PepsiCo. They're a Pepsi product. Josta was a Pepsi product. Dr. Pepper.
6691320	6695320	Okay. Yeah, they're like that. What was that other game that I was trying to think of the name of?
6695320	6699800	Yeah, JD, I thought so. 7 Up is part of Dr. Pepper's Snapple.
6699800	6705880	Okay, whatever. So anyway, we've got all kinds of versions that were released but, you know,
6705880	6713880	as far as the other, the other games, I mean, the music in the games, you know, how a lot of the
6713880	6721880	DDR games went from the, great. Now, the fuck, what were the CDs?
6723640	6725400	VCDs or? Dance Mania CDs.
6725400	6727880	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Dance Maniacs.
6727880	6731800	Yeah, well, it went though from a lot of, I'm trying to think of the company.
6732440	6733480	Oh, Toshiba EMI.
6733480	6741080	Yeah, Toshiba EMI. But, you know, Konami also had their own in-house as well. And for Pump It
6741080	6746040	Up, they had Banya, which was their in-house artist group.
6746040	6749320	What good timing. We're in a Banya song right now. Love is a Danger Zone.
6749320	6758520	Another good time. But they got a lot of good K-pop licenses. And they even though would go
6758520	6765960	kind of like how, again, DDR was doing too. There were covers of classical music done in
6765960	6771960	symphonic rock style, like for example, Canon and D. Okay, I hate Canon. I hate playing it. Okay,
6771960	6777000	that's my tangent on that one for me. But they'd have some jazz and folk and ska in there. It was
6777000	6788920	pretty cool. The only thing is that they were not so keen on some of the electronic music.
6789480	6796680	But the first time it came up would be in NX2, usually with covers of American music. So
6797960	6801160	there you go. It all started with the first dance floor.
6801720	6811640	All right, there it is the classic game of the week. Pump It Up, aka that other dance game.
6813400	6815960	Man, I'm still trying to remember what the one that had the six.
6816600	6821400	So I was just say this day and age is kind of, I mean, fast forward to 15 years later,
6821400	6824840	I mean, we say that tongue in cheek that other dance game. But now it's like, especially when
6824840	6829720	you go to a place like round one, it's right. It's side by side with DDR. And you've got people
6829720	6832840	that are playing both. That's the one I was trying to think of was Easy to Dancer.
6833400	6838280	Easy to Dancer. Oh my God. That's right. They had one in that bowling alley in Oakland.
6838280	6845160	There's your Snapple. That's not even the Snapple. That's like Shasta.
6845160	6851560	That's the Dr. Thunder. It's the Walmart brand. Easy to Dancer was okay,
6851560	6857800	but my God, it was kind of boring. All right. 3DDX was like the RC Cola.
6858760	6862200	Oh God. All right. We got to take a break. When we come back, guys, plenty more of
6862200	6865720	Orange Lounge Radio. We got some emails tonight. We're going to get into release dates as well.
6865720	6868840	And your calls. We actually don't have as many stories in part B, which probably good
6868840	6872440	because this first part is run long. We're almost at two hours, just the first half of the show.
6872440	6876360	Yeah. We got allowed. We're old. Yeah, I know. We got plenty more show to come.
6876360	6879720	Your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype after a quick break. Don't go anywhere. We
6879720	6886120	will be right back on this very special OLR. To register participation for this week's
6886120	6890360	episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, lock.
6916120	6921240	All of our love and support go out to you tonight on this special day. Rob, Jamie and Loki.
6921240	6926520	Oh my God. It's almost your sweet 16 hearts. There better be a party for that y'all. Anyway,
6926520	6930120	have a great show. Congrats again and see you space cowboy.
6931400	6935960	Thank you very much to our pals over at gameboy.org. We didn't even ask for those
6935960	6941160	because some of you might've been like, OLR was taking the bumpers. Actually, we didn't solicit
6941160	6945000	that. That just showed up in Dropbox. So I thought that was a nice little surprise from
6945000	6948200	our pals over at gameboy.org. So thank you very much for that. I appreciate that. And I love what
6948200	6954200	they do over there so much that I do a show on the side with those two. It was a lot of fun.
6954200	6957240	So anyway, um, also I want to make sure this doesn't get lost in the shuffle. I do want to
6957240	6961480	get back into gaming news, but we've had so much going on tonight with, with E3 and the 15th
6961480	6965880	birthday and all that other stuff. I want to make sure this doesn't get lost. Happy father's day
6965880	6971560	to all the gamer dads and dad-like figures and et cetera and so forth out there, uh, including
6971560	6976680	our very own, of course, Loki is, uh, celebrating father's day today. Did the kids leave you alone
6976680	6984520	today so you could play video games? Well, that's a rip off. Sorry to hear that. That's right. They,
6984520	6989800	we went to dinner last night and then they're so whiny yesterday, but ah, what are you gonna do?
6989800	6994600	All right. Uh, well anyway, so, so yes. And of course, cat dads, dog dads, all that. I hope
6994600	6998280	everybody, whoever, however you're celebrating today, you're enjoying your father's day today.
6998280	7003400	And moms who are dads to their kids. Why not? Why not? Why not? Single moms or whatever the
7003400	7008920	situation is. All the single mamas put your hands up. All right. Uh, we're going to get back into
7008920	7014680	some video game news though. Let's go to some rapid fire news. Loki. So there's this, um,
7014680	7022680	cool video I saw online for this. They have a VR center now that's in Namco Bandai's VR zone in
7022680	7028840	Shinjuku. And they have a lot of cool games. They're one of which is actually a VR super
7028840	7034440	Mario Kart experience. So you actually sit in these little, it looks like go-karts. You have
7034440	7039320	a vibe on and they even have like sensors on their hands so that you could throw shells and
7039320	7046040	everything. It looks pretty bad-ass. Um, aside from that, let's just say that Mario isn't your
7046040	7053080	thing. Then, um, they would also have a neon Genesis game. They actually go and, um, fight,
7053080	7057320	you know, some of the angels in that. And then they even have a Dragon Ball Z experience as
7057320	7061400	well. So you can like throw fireballs and stuff. Hmm. It looks pretty, pretty awesome from the
7061400	7065800	video. So I want to check that out, but that made me think, you know, when we're talking about the
7065800	7070200	whole Super Nintendo land and like a Mario Kart experience, I was like, I could see something very
7070200	7074680	similar to that being like the Mario Kart experience. So it's not like a new ride they
7074680	7080040	have over at, um, Six Flags Marine World or whatever they're calling it now over in Vallejo.
7080040	7083720	They have the whole, uh, like there's some roller coaster, but it runs on VR or something.
7084760	7087880	Like it's like part roller coaster, but you have big headsets on. Oh,
7089080	7093160	that they, I know they have like some of these roller coasters that they can kind of like remix
7093160	7098280	the experience basically. So they have a, it's, um, at least the ones I've seen in the past have
7098280	7104040	been a gear VR and you wear them on your, your face and it's synced, the movements are synced
7104040	7109320	to the actual ride. So you're feeling all the G forces and stuff from the roller coaster,
7109320	7112520	but you're like flying through space or like at the city or something like that.
7113400	7117480	Does that mean that's cool? I still don't like roller coasters enough to try that,
7117480	7121800	but it looks cool. Sounds cool. By the way, a quick follow up before you get to your other thing,
7121800	7126600	quick follow up on the happy father's day thing. Uh, JD reminds me of this. There was a
7126600	7132120	game announced on steam today called dream daddy, a dad dating simulator that's making
7132120	7135880	its rounds on the internet. So it reminded me to, uh, wish a happy father's day to all
7135880	7141080	those daddies out there as well. Wink nudge. Sorry, Loki back to you.
7141640	7149720	So wasting no time whatsoever. There was a mod for super Mario 64 called super Mario
7149720	7158680	Odyssey 64 that allows you to have the, um, hat power up to take control of different creatures,
7158680	7163720	including like they have a bomb, um, all the different things. So you can even use that on,
7163720	7170520	um, was it on the castle grounds? You can take control of birds and other stuff,
7170520	7177480	collect and throw coins. Um, so very cool. So yeah, that was released by cause a, uh,
7177480	7185160	um, a monitor and yeah, I mean, that's just crazy that it only took him like a week to do that.
7185160	7190920	So if you're interested in checking it out, um, they had a link on Kotaku for it. So good.
7190920	7197160	Or go Nintendo has a link too. So, all right. All right. Well, moving on, uh, this is, uh,
7197160	7202040	another rerelease of this game. That's come out a few times in different platforms. It's 2064
7202040	7206440	read only memories, uh, which came from mid boss, which we had Matt from mid boss on the show.
7206440	7211320	They're also the folks that put on gamer X, which that did get funded gamer X East. So our pals on
7211320	7215160	the East coast will get to go to that for a second time this year. Um, but mid boss also
7215160	7219720	behind this game, 2064 read only memories. And it was announced this week that it will be coming out
7219720	7225000	to the Nintendo switch and there will be some new extras, including some switch exclusive features,
7225000	7230840	new voice scenes, fast skip auto save and, uh, other core gaming improvements. And it's running
7230840	7238040	on a new framework for unity. So they're calling it 2064 read only memories in integral. So good
7238040	7242840	luck with that release. That's early 18, 2018. We don't know specifically when yet.
7243400	7250040	And, uh, another piece I have here, this comes from, um, uh, actually the, uh, Southern fried
7250040	7255240	game room expo, which a VOG network was sponsoring during this last weekend. I know Bobby was talking
7255240	7260120	a lot about it on his show, but I hope some of y'all, some of y'all were able to go visit that,
7260120	7267640	uh, there was a, um, cabinet there, a restored sky skipper cabinet. And this was something where,
7267800	7273800	um, Nintendo was going to put this out, I guess, but then they didn't, uh, it was dropped in 1982.
7273800	7279160	Uh, but, uh, even though some ROMs found their way online, uh, and I guess there was an Atari
7279160	7282520	2,600 version of this, although I don't remember it at all, but I guess that was something there
7282520	7287640	was no cabinets, uh, that were really known to exist. So they actually were able to get one of
7287640	7292600	the cabinets from the vaults of Nintendo America. So that's something right there that Nintendo kind
7292600	7297000	of agreed to let this happen. So that's pretty cool. Uh, and then, uh, yeah, there was a prototype
7297080	7301800	cabinet that was actually built and on display there as Southern fried, uh, Southern fried game
7301800	7308760	room expo. And there's a whole little walkthrough and all this stuff over at YouTube, John's arcade,
7308760	7313960	which I know dark soccer has mentioned on the show before. And w speaking of ties from a long time
7313960	7318280	ago, John being one of the hosts on video game outsiders, which was at all games radio at the
7318280	7323160	same time we were so kind of funny how that all plays out. Now he has a massively successful
7323160	7330200	YouTube channel and we're, well, we're turning 15. I'm just teasing. No, that's great. Uh, so
7330200	7333960	yeah, I would like to play this game someday. Perhaps that machine will tour the country.
7333960	7338760	We'll see. Uh, anyhow, uh, let's move on dark soccer. A few things from you.
7339640	7348040	Oh, just some stuff basically. Um, first of all, going on about the Atari 2,600,
7348040	7354280	there is a revival console that, uh, is, uh, going to be, I mean, first of all,
7354280	7360920	there's a bajillion ways that you can play, um, Atari 2,600 games regardless, but now, um,
7361800	7372840	there is, uh, the retron 77 that is, uh, basically a remade Atari 2,600. You can use original
7372840	7379960	joysticks, but you can use USB controllers. And, um, they, the theory is going that it would be
7379960	7387880	retail about 80 bucks. So we'll see, of course, uh, being released by, uh, Hyperkin. And then the
7387880	7399240	second thing not so happy is that, um, Keith Robinson, uh, who is the guy behind the Intellivision,
7399240	7406360	he died on Wednesday this past week, 61 years old, not bad, not great, but, um,
7407240	7412040	you know, he, uh, designed games for, uh, the Intellivision that was put up by Mattel.
7412680	7417560	And then he bought the rights to a television and, uh, kept up with Intellivision lives
7417560	7423720	collections. So thank you to him and rest in peace. Yeah. You know, actually I'm speaking
7423720	7427240	of E3 memories. I don't know if you guys remember this, but that whole year, you know, and I
7427240	7430360	referenced this earlier in the show that whole year that all the all game stuff was there at
7430360	7434760	the arena. He was there being interviewed by Scott over at all games and all of them, he was,
7434760	7439080	he was there at that arena. What did they call the arena lounge or whatever it was during the
7439080	7442520	during E3, that one year. So I remember meeting the guy and, you know, listening to some of his
7442520	7447560	stories. So it's, um, you know, it's, it's definitely a loss and a harsh reminder that
7447560	7452600	some of these great minds in gaming that brought us these games in the seventies and eighties,
7452600	7457240	you know, they're getting up there in age is as horrible as it may sound to say, you know,
7457240	7462520	we gotta, we gotta get as many interviews, as many recordings, as many stories, as much as we
7462520	7466920	can about those times before it's too late. So, Oh, one thing I wanted to mention, I forgot to
7466920	7471480	mention during my VR story. Yeah. One of the other games that they noticed that they had on there
7471480	7477000	was a VR prop cycle game. Oh yeah. Everybody like, you know, doing the whole like, you know,
7477720	7479880	stationary bike thing. So I thought that was kind of cool.
7480040	7485000	Huh? All right. Well, let's travel around and look at what's coming out in stores
7485000	7487480	this week. What will be on shelves this week, Loki?
7487480	7495240	So this week we've got God Wars Future Pass on PlayStation 4 and Vita. Um, we have Next Machina
7495240	7505000	on PC and PlayStation 4, and then on 3DS Ever Oasis, um, Get Even on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox
7505000	7513480	One. And finally Secret Worlds Legends on PC. All right. Traveling over to Japan, uh, on the
7513480	7518760	PlayStation 4 this week in Japan, LocoRoco gets its release. Uh, I remember they were remastering
7518760	7523480	some old favorites from like PSP and stuff, uh, or, you know, like Prapa was one of these. Now
7523480	7528120	LocoRoco is coming as well. That'll be out on PlayStation 4 on June the 22nd, as well as Far
7528120	7535160	Point gets its Japanese release this week. Uh, over on the Vita, Tokyo Yamanote Boys 4 V
7535160	7540520	main disc in regular and limited edition, as well as a game called God Wars, uh, which I believe is
7540520	7547160	Future Pass, but they call it, uh, in Japan, Toki wo Koete comes out this week. And lastly,
7547160	7551400	I want to see if anything's on the Switch this week. They are getting some of the Zelda figures
7551400	7556120	this week in Japan, the Skyward Sword, Twilight Princess, and Majora's Mask. But otherwise amiibos
7556120	7561240	are really the only thing to look forward to on the Switch. Uh, the 3DS doesn't really have
7561240	7565560	anything except a game called the Alliance Alive that I must admit I don't know much about, but
7565560	7571720	that is what is out in Japan this week. How about the UK DarkSakura? Uh, some stuff, really not a
7571720	7580120	terrible lot. On the 19th is, uh, Dungeon Defenders 2 for Xbox One, the 21st Argo for PC, and the 22nd
7580120	7589480	RPG Maker Fests. That's it. All right. I think it's time that we dive into the mailbag. Every
7589480	7596280	week you guys email us over at participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we, uh, reads our emails
7596280	7600040	as DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and pulls out emails. And sorry, there's, I don't know where my
7600040	7605240	music is tonight. How'd it get all sticky? Where'd my music go for this segment? It's gone. You know
7605240	7612760	what? I guess I'll just have to find the mailbag music. That's it. After the 15th anniversary,
7612760	7616600	we're doing the fuck you music now. No, I'm just kidding. We would never, not with our listeners,
7616600	7620680	not with our listeners. All right. But no, seriously, I think you guys did send us quite
7620680	7625960	a few emails tonight, right? Yeah, a few. Yeah. So I will start at the start.
7627720	7632760	Hello, LR. Congratulations on surviving and thriving through 15 years of the show where
7632760	7637640	every gamer has a voice on this momentous occasion where we look back and realize just
7637640	7642440	how long 15 years actually is. I can share something with you that happened to me
7642440	7647720	recently and remind me that yes, we were all getting older. I live about 10 minutes away
7647720	7655640	from a place called Sport Time USA. This place has existed since the 1990s and, uh, at least,
7655640	7661320	and somehow it still exists today, probably due to a combination of high prices, a lack of competition
7661320	7667160	and regular visits from schools, camps, and groups of religious and disabled. Inside,
7667160	7671960	it looks dingy, dirty, half the games are broken or close enough, and most of them aren't worth
7671960	7677480	playing anyway, but they have in the group, too, and it 100% works, and that's the only reason I go
7677480	7682760	there once or twice a week, every week. Last night, I ran into an 11-year-old kid who looked
7682760	7688760	at my onscreen USB name and recognized me both from my several high scores on the machine and
7688760	7692920	also my status as a somewhat well-known member of the East Coast Music Gaming community.
7692920	7697240	He is a huge fan of StepMania and in the group already, and although he's got a lot of work to do
7697880	7708280	to, uh, G-I-T-G-U-D, he, uh, get good, okay, I don't know what that is, so it's kind of a meme,
7708280	7714440	get good, okay, whatever, um, he was already, um, very familiar with the game, the community,
7714440	7717160	and the work they've done on and around the game. For the record,
7717160	7723880	slang can go over my head if I don't use it every day, so whatever. Of course, he has about a million
7723880	7729640	questions for me. I honestly can't remember most of them because they were asked over eight minutes
7729640	7735000	ago, and I'm a goldfish, but I'll never forget this one. He asked me which game I played first,
7735000	7738840	DDR or in the groove, because eyes went wide as I told him I started playing DDR that there was no
7738840	7743560	such thing as in the groove yet. Then my own eyes went wide as I realized what was about to happen,
7743560	7748040	but it was already too late. I could only listen in horror, and I distinctly heard these words
7748040	7754200	escape my list lips. I've been playing this game since before you were born. This is the very first
7754200	7761160	time that during a moment in which I was standing on a dance game machine platform, I really, truly,
7761160	7766120	and finally started to feel old. Oh, well, so, um, yeah, happy 15 years and we're old.
7766120	7772840	Loving Kisses, Y Y R. Y Y R, I heart you. I respect you. I wish you much,
7772840	7776680	much success in your game development. Now fuck right off with that email.
7781720	7785960	Since before you were born. Oh my God. I feel so old.
7787160	7794760	Back in my day, in the groove, we played DDR on a low res monitor and there was no free
7794760	7799000	there was either. And all the arrows were the same color. Back in my day,
7799000	7806440	we used a jungle book dance pad to play imported DDR games. Probably most people that I know of
7807080	7813400	started DDR. Well, no, cause we did get that first mix that didn't have the vivid arrows
7813400	7819480	and you played stomped my beat and you liked it. Some of us played while hitting each other with
7819480	7828040	bats, Rob. Now, now think about this. Think about this, Ms. Summers. That was before this
7828040	7834920	kid was born. Yeah. Damn new fuck right off of that email. No, but that, but that had to have
7834920	7841720	been a experience for the stomp to my beat freestyle involved a person I don't associate
7841720	7848120	with anymore and her ex. I know, I know. Crazy. It's crazy how things are involved with. And then
7848120	7854440	I besides better stomped my beat the fucking sandstorm. Sandstorm didn't exist at the time.
7854440	7859480	I even look in just in general, I even look into some of these people I see coming into like the
7859480	7864920	arcades I go to now and I'm looking at them going like you were five when I started OLR probably.
7866440	7874120	It's just, I, yeah. Now get off my lawn next email. Hey you guys, thank you so very much for
7874120	7880680	blessing our ear holes with your insight, wit, humor, and fucks, Lukey. Happy to anytime.
7880680	7885960	I've listened to every single show since the Katamari debacle that you put on my gaydar.
7888360	7894600	Ever since a slow, even during slow news weeks, the show always entertains and gives me something
7894600	7900200	new to look forward to come Monday morning. It takes a lot more than dedication and persistence,
7900280	7905960	I'm going to add and boredom to do this almost every week of every year.
7905960	7914520	And alcohol. I'm motivated by spite and porn. It took a lot of porn to get through these 15 years.
7914520	7918440	In fact, I just, there was, there was a fucking episode of OLR early on. I was in the first
7918440	7924360	hundred episodes. I wasn't here. I was the missing one. And Jamie and Loki did a show.
7924360	7928600	And all I heard about that show was, yeah, we just, we watched a porn live on air.
7930600	7933400	And I was like, the fuck happens when I'm not there.
7935640	7938840	Was that the one where Marin Marvel was here? No, that was, that was another,
7938840	7941560	that was a different episode. You guys have done the show without me,
7941560	7944920	even though I don't remember right now at my house. I think it was a Jamie. So I think it
7944920	7948760	was that long period. We did the show at my house. It was that place with the upstairs,
7948760	7956040	downstairs, you had the townhouse. Yes. Yes, it was. Anyway. Um, where I hosted my first
7956040	7960360	Bemani party there. We used to do Bemani parties regularly. That would usually just fall apart
7960360	7966680	when people would start drinking. Um, okay. So back to this, um, it takes a deep and unwavering
7966680	7971960	friendship. You guys genuinely love each other and that comes through crystal clear over the airwaves.
7971960	7976040	I love Dark Sakura's wealth of knowledge on classic games and consoles and political views.
7976040	7981080	Well, finally someone appreciates my political views. Loki's unwavering, brutal honesty and
7981080	7987000	hatred of shitty gaming news. Rob's unapologetic and steely support of Nintendo and professionalism,
7987000	7992360	sometimes LOL. Well, I get mad at Nintendo sometimes too, but we remember it comes,
7992360	7996840	it comes from a Tyra Banks place. We were rooting for you! Yeah, Valentina.
8000200	8003720	Valentina is going to become my scapegoat for everything now, you know. I'm just trying to
8003720	8009720	be to the community what Selena was. Dark Sakura. Girl, you do not go there. I know you do not,
8009720	8016920	you do not invoke the name of the Lord and savior. The Latina goddess. Yes. Anyway,
8016920	8021240	I always stay in the loop when it comes to games and new developments, but I don't have many
8021240	8027160	friends that are as caught up and able to form opinions regarding the news of the week. It is
8027160	8032840	always fun to listen to your opinions and colorful dialogue. I have been a PlayStation loyalist. I'm
8032840	8040120	Rissimo on PSN by the way. I recognize that name. Games like Tomb Raider and Horizon Zero Dawn
8040760	8044840	may seem daunting initially, but there are adjustable difficulty settings.
8044840	8050360	And when you have, uh, when you get in the groove, the game flows like fucking butter.
8051640	8056280	Bad imagery. Tomb Raider is fucking great. I have a story about an X and butter, so I'm going to
8056280	8064440	leave it at that. Uh, I was like, uh, you had my attention. You have my attention, but I'm not
8064440	8069400	after, after this 15 year, which I would call like sibling ship. We probably have here. I'm not sure
8069400	8073320	I want to know any more about this story. Actually, this might be the OLR after dark.
8074840	8079800	I see. That's why I was just going to leave it there. So those two words together, just like
8080520	8087640	bad memory. Um, I know you all have PS4s and haven't played this masterpiece. I've gotten
8087640	8094120	my, I've gotten my eight platinum via this game. I will, what'd the chat room say? Act
8094120	8099560	deaf to chat says, I can't believe it's not my X and butter. I totally butchered that quote too.
8099560	8106520	You had my curiosity, but now you have my attention. Anyway, I will buy it and ship it
8106520	8112920	to you as a birthday gift, but only if you pledge to finish it. Let's finish a game. That's great.
8112920	8116360	Let's finish a game. You know what though? That horizon zero dawn was on like a super
8116360	8121000	sale recently. It was down to like, I seriously, I think until now, because I looked today,
8121000	8125320	I wanted the full, I checked the steam sale countdown page. And since they're doing the
8125320	8133880	steam sale in three days, Oh fuck. I'm getting zen inverse. So anyway, but I do, I do want to
8133880	8144600	play it though. On this tangents on my OLR. I also bought PSVR a month ago and I'm totally
8144600	8149960	enamored with it. I got a sweet traveling case and I'm always packing it up and taking it over
8149960	8157480	to friends houses. Buy it in caps. I know you felt burned by buying the PS4 pro Rob, but you don't
8157480	8162680	have a 4k TV yet. So there's negligible differences with the few games you play on the system.
8163240	8167800	I really just want to thank you guys and congratulate you all on a job. Well done.
8167800	8173000	Fucking well. Thank you. Um, love the show and love you all Rissimo. Oh,
8173000	8177640	that was a very sweet email. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I'm thinking about it with PlayStation VR,
8177640	8183480	but 4k gaming is going to be my next big investment. Probably loan your mind if you
8183480	8187640	want it. Here we go. Here we go. Share and share alike. Why not? And then I could buy a copy of
8187720	8192920	horizon and we can, we can trade around. Doesn't that sound like fun? I still have injustice to
8192920	8199720	play. There you go. And the game and get on that. The game that, um, the nonary games that Shane,
8199720	8203800	Oh yeah. Which you're probably never going to hear from me again, but I'm,
8203800	8207480	but when that sale goes on, if dragon balls universe two goes cheap, I'm buying it.
8208360	8215960	All right. More emails. Yes. Yeah. Yes. I just have to get to it. All right. We have
8215960	8220120	three more to go. Oh my God. All right. Well, big show tonight. That's why we cut stories tonight.
8221800	8228120	Hello. My congratulations on your 15 years of podcast existence. Thank you. Excuse me. I think
8228120	8233800	I started listening to your show in late 2015 before that I wasn't really aware podcasts at
8233800	8238680	all. Unfortunately I didn't discover all of this earlier, but since I, but since then I have
8238680	8242920	enjoyed listening to your show. It is not always easy to keep track of all the gaming news during
8242920	8248280	the week. So I appreciate that you take the time to do the show every Sunday. The fact that you're
8248280	8253720	an open and welcome welcoming podcast is an important bonus too. About me, my gaming life
8254440	8261880	go boosted when I bought a Wii U and Bayonetta 2 back in 2014. I still play Bayonetta 2
8261880	8268200	regularly tag, uh, tag climax anyone, despite all the other new games. The Wii U game pad also got
8268200	8273400	me back into drawing and I posted lots of things on Miiverse. However, with the switch, I feel like
8273400	8279480	Miiverse is slowly disintegrating. Since I do reside in Germany, I cannot listen to your show
8279480	8284440	live. It is basically in the middle of the night. So rely on the podcast every Monday morning.
8284440	8288280	You could stay up late on a three day weekend if you really loved us. No, I'm totally can. I'm
8288280	8294680	totally occasionally, very occasionally we will do like, uh, on earlier. Yeah. Maybe it's time we do
8294680	8300120	another noon for us show, which would be like eight o'clock out there. Maybe, well, we're gonna,
8300120	8306040	we're gonna really think about that. It's about time we do another Euro time show. Okay. Sorry,
8306040	8310680	go ahead. That's okay. Um, I, uh, of course I also listen to other podcasts and I admit that it
8310680	8315800	sometimes can be difficult to keep up with all of them, but yours currently has the highest priority.
8315800	8321640	Smile on your Jubilee. I would like to know the following in your opinion, what has changed in
8321640	8327080	podcasting during the last 15 years? I'll do a question by question. What has changed in
8327080	8333320	podcasting in the last 15 years? Audio quality. Well, there was no podcasting when this show
8333320	8339160	started. And that's part of the reason why we see it. You get in a lot of technicalities.
8339160	8348440	Are we the longest running podcast for gaming? I think so, but I don't know. But because, well,
8348440	8353080	here's the thing is that the podcasting is the technology wasn't really around until 2005, 2006.
8353080	8358040	So we got on that pre iTunes, which there were very few shows that were on iTunes at the same
8358040	8363720	time. I think the only one that is still putting out new shows is video game news radio, but even
8363720	8367640	they're like once a year, I don't think they're regular at this point anymore. I apologize.
8367640	8372920	I've lost sight. I've lost sight of, well, so do we, I've lost sight of a lot of these shows
8372920	8376440	and can't listen to everything regularly, but I think, you know, they're still around, but I think
8376840	8380120	they kind of changed and, you know, I don't, I don't think there's regular, but anyway,
8380120	8383000	I don't want to sound shady cause I'm totally not like it's, it's impressive that they're
8383000	8385400	even still putting out what they do. It's hard to keep track of the whole internet.
8385400	8388920	It is hard to keep track of the whole internet. It is. But, but the thing is that when we first
8388920	8393640	started the show, it was a live show on live through CC five. And then as soon as it actually,
8393640	8398200	and people sometimes forget this for a little while, the podcast was always meant to be the
8398200	8404040	spinoff. And in the very beginning, we had the OLR to go edition. So for about a year,
8404040	8408840	we were doing what was designed to be a 20 minute show on all gaming news.
8408840	8413880	That was dial-up back then. Well, even that it was a 20 minute show on all gaming news
8413880	8419880	to go with our three hour Bamani and music show. And then after about a year, we started to realize,
8419880	8425960	um, this to go thing got us on the news. Uh, there's more people listening to this, like,
8425960	8430920	like 25, like, like double digit times, the number of people listening to this and listening to us
8430920	8434760	live. So it was kind of like one of those, maybe podcasting is kind of where we need to shift this
8434760	8439960	other thing too, but we didn't want to lose the magic of what we do live. You know, there aren't
8439960	8445240	a lot of podcasts that do what we're doing. It's hard to say now because of Twitch and things like
8445240	8448440	that. It's kind of like, well, actually, yeah, more people are doing the live chatting and all
8448440	8452920	that stuff, but you know, there aren't a lot of straight up podcasts out there that take live
8452920	8457400	calls and stuff. So the whole live environment and, and the fact that we're all in one room,
8458200	8462120	I think too, and there has been times where it's like, do we really need to all be in one room?
8462120	8468120	But I think it kind of brings a magic to this show that Skype shows don't always have. It's
8468120	8471400	hard to do it through Skype. It is. It's very hard. I mean, cause there was, there was many
8471400	8474200	months where you were on Skype. There's many months where Loki was on Skype, but that was
8474200	8479400	never the permanent plan. You know, it's always came back to us in one room. And I'll tell you
8479400	8484120	this, the three months I was off the show was fucking hard. Yeah. It was really hard.
8484120	8489960	Yes. SSJ 100, Matt podcasting. It's so much fun. Yes. To that day that has ruined that phrase for
8489960	8496040	me ever. I can every time, like I'm about to say it, I don't say it because, Oh, you want to eat
8496040	8502520	at work in one of my training manuals, I found the word plausible and I changed it. Thanks to
8502520	8507720	our chatters. So just, it doesn't, this show doesn't only ruin your life, just putting it
8507720	8511880	out there. But anyway, what else was I going to say with that? Oh yeah. I didn't want to sound
8511880	8516600	like I was shading Skype shows at all. I've done plenty of them, uh, of spinoff shows and I still
8516600	8523160	do my reading is fundamentals over Skype. And I love it. I love it. But that is, that is a magic
8523160	8528760	for those shows. What we have going here is unique to what we're doing here. And. You know, I just
8528760	8532440	don't, if, if Skype were to ever be the permanent solution, I think we would be better off just
8532440	8536200	saying, you know what, it's time to end OLR and move on to a different project. So the next
8536200	8541320	question, what is your motivation to do this show every week or what goal do you wish to achieve
8541320	8548680	with it? Um, I will go ahead and say right now, it's the big thing I look forward to every week.
8548680	8557400	It's almost like my transition of the week, you know, for me, it's my indicator. It's the
8557400	8565640	culmination of my week, if that makes sense. And then I go and I start my new work week. It really,
8565640	8572440	I don't know, almost adds, and this is apart from just loving gaming and loving who we podcast with,
8572440	8580760	but I'm looking at it more in terms of its position in my life. It's my weekly transition
8580760	8587800	and without it, I was really off, off kilter. I mean, I would know my days, you know,
8588360	8594920	but I wouldn't have that, that one pivoting part in my week that I was looking forward to every
8594920	8601240	week. And so it's kind of hard to put that into words. I mean, apart from just doing the show
8601240	8606840	anyway, because, you know, I love gaming. I love you guys. Um, I, I like everybody in this room,
8606840	8616200	mostly kidding. Um, but it's, I feel kind of empty without it. I, I, no, I hear you loud and clear.
8616200	8621400	Maybe this is something not everybody out there can understand, but like the weeks that we aren't
8621400	8626520	doing OLR, I find myself going, Oh, it's six o'clock. I should be on OLR right now. Or,
8626520	8630600	Oh, it's five 45. It's about time for Bobby to call us no matter where I am. And I think
8630600	8634200	it's something about like, it's just become like such a hat. Like I think churches for some people,
8634200	8637880	I don't want to sound sacrilegious or anything, but I think, I think church is kind of that reset
8637880	8642440	for some people in that way, that equilibrium. And I definitely feel that as well. And I'm not
8642440	8647080	going to lie. The discipline to do this show is hard. Sometimes I have wanted to walk away from
8647080	8651640	the show in the past it's happened. We've all hit that point, but then you find that thing
8651640	8655960	that kind of brings you back. You know, there's that, there's that email that I'll tell you what
8655960	8660040	this, this, these, this fucking changed my life. And it reminds me why I do all our there'll be
8660040	8667400	that email that comes in that says for me anyway, that says, Rob, I didn't know you could be gay and
8667400	8671960	like video games. And then that was okay. And like, for me, that's been like a huge motivator
8671960	8676920	in what has continued at least for me. And I'm sure, you know, Jamie and Loki have had
8676920	8682680	stuff from their perspectives as well. But yeah, I mean, I'm going to be honest, even recently,
8682680	8688840	like the thought had crossed my mind months ago. I was like, maybe episode 700 is a nice round
8688840	8693320	number to end it on. Maybe, maybe, maybe kind of like lost. Remember when that show was on the
8693320	8697160	air, they set the end date like two years in the future. Maybe we just need to say this is the day
8697160	8702760	it ends and stick to it. And then that way it's not going to catch anybody off guard. But then,
8703560	8706200	but then something always happens that kind of just makes you go,
8707160	8710680	but like, what the fuck would I do my do with myself without it? And there is going to come
8710680	8714040	a point in my life where I'm going to have to answer that question. This isn't going to last
8714040	8720760	forever. It is going to end someday. But I just, I'm not ready to answer yet. And I don't think
8720760	8723720	Jamie is, I don't know. I don't think Matt is either. I don't know. Anything you want to add
8723720	8730040	to that, Matt? I don't know. Like if I'm not doing the show on like Sundays, then
8730040	8737800	it's like a few more hours. I have to spend the kids. And plus it shows like, you know, it's,
8738600	8743480	I don't work in the game industry anymore. So like I can't talk games to anybody. Cause like my,
8743480	8748120	my coworkers, I literally work in the department full of old women. Well, not necessarily old
8748120	8753000	women, just women. I have one, actually my coworker, he plays Overwatch. So I, you know,
8753000	8757640	I talked to him, but like, I've got nobody to talk to other than, other than that. So this is like my
8757640	8761480	other than that. So this is like my outlet. Otherwise they'd be like my son who just like,
8762200	8769160	you know, verbal vomit all the time. Just like, here's my chain of thought. I'm just going to
8769160	8776280	keep it going. And it's like, okay, I can only listen to that so long, but no, I mean, yeah,
8776280	8781560	I do this as long as I can. And I will go on record saying that I would take a bullet for
8781560	8789160	anybody in this house on record, even maybe Sanrio. She doesn't run first.
8789160	8793160	That's that's very, that's very, very sweet. But in general, let's hope it doesn't come to that.
8793880	8800120	But I'm saying that coming here and being with you guys every week, it's for me, it's wonderful. So
8801320	8804840	now, now before I say something else, maybe cry next email, please.
8805080	8806840	The fuck? I know there's more to this email.
8808040	8811720	I mean, yeah, sorry. Yay. But is it going to be more sap?
8812600	8816520	Okay. All right. What are your plans for the future of the podcast? I've read that
8816520	8821080	Apple plans to provide podcast analytics that show more information about podcast
8821080	8825880	listeners. What do you think about that? I got no free time to look at that.
8826520	8829800	We're not doing it for how many people listen. We're doing it because we,
8829800	8833560	because the ones who do already, I can tell mine more people.
8833560	8837560	I can tell you straight up. I don't know how many people listen to this show.
8838120	8842600	I don't. Can I find it? I think so. I think I know the report I need to run
8842600	8845800	to find how many people listen to the show. I know how many people were listening to this
8845800	8851160	show at one point. I know how many were listening to it at its peak. And I know it came down by
8851160	8855000	quite a bit since the peak. And that's, that's okay. As there's been more stuff and more options
8855000	8861240	out there to listen to people, though, I am a little bit curious. I know people are curious,
8861240	8864360	but I don't come from, it's like, you know, you don't want to get in that mindset of thinking
8864360	8868920	about how many listeners you have. It's just like it because it's always going to eat away.
8868920	8872040	It's like, Oh, we only have this many or, Oh, you know, we have this many,
8872040	8877080	we had 12 at one time. We had 12 on the first episode and the only look in chat. Now we have
8877080	8883400	44 people in chat minus robots and so forth. So I, you know what? There's at least some people
8883400	8886920	would kill to have 30 people give a shit about what they have to say. You know what I mean?
8887720	8894520	And so it's just, whether it's 30 or it's 30,000, it's not 30,000. I'm grateful that y'all give a
8894520	8898680	shit and that you're here to join in on this. Sorry, Jamie. I'm in a podcast community on
8898680	8903160	Facebook, just like, you know, people helping each other, talking about equipment. And I see
8903160	8908280	these people with these huge mungus rigs and all they're talking about is their analytics. All
8908280	8912200	they're talking about is their numbers. All they're talking about is their funding. And I'm like,
8912200	8918840	where is the love? You know, are you trying to make a career out of this or are you doing it
8918840	8924360	because you love it? Oh yeah. I've, I've said something similar to that in a room full of
8924360	8929800	podcasters and you would have thought I just like did what Sinead O'Connor did on Saturday Night
8929800	8936280	Live and tore up a picture of the Pope. Like it's, it's a different mindset for different people,
8936280	8941720	but there are two to be fair. There are a lot of podcasters that do do it out of the love,
8941720	8945400	but then there's always that thinking about, I mean, the money with a lot of people too,
8945400	8949800	that kind of like if they're doing it as their career and this is my income, yeah,
8949800	8953720	you're going to be thinking about the way it's like, am I going to be able to afford rent next
8953720	8959160	month? I mean, that's, you know, they're more lucrative things to get into other than podcasting.
8959560	8963880	Don't get me wrong. The coin is great. And if somebody were to come to OLR and offer us the
8963880	8970280	coin, as long as we still had the freedom to do exactly what we do now, I think we'd be open to
8970280	8976600	that, but I'm not really motivated to go chase it down. I, I've come to peace with the fact a long
8976600	8982040	time ago, we're not making money off of OLR. This is a labor of love, but it has brought so much
8982040	8988280	in the means of like friendship and just the fact that, and I don't know if you guys feel this too,
8988280	8993640	but like no matter what fucking city I go to in America, I know somebody there and it's because
8993640	8998280	of this show and I've had even in other countries, even in other countries, I've had people say to me,
8998280	9001640	I don't get to do a lot of like country traveling a lot. And I have people say to me, Rob, how do
9001640	9007800	you fucking know people everywhere? And I'm like, it's because of the show. Yeah. Yeah. And that,
9007800	9014120	that's something coin don't get you. Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't mind doing a few things to help,
9014120	9019000	you know, put a little bit in our coffer, you know, for, you know, like repairing our equipment.
9019000	9023640	You can give me biddies on Twitch. My door is open, but I don't want to beg for it.
9023640	9028600	Yeah. I'm not going to, you know, I would rather put out, you know, if it was going to do something,
9028600	9034440	I'd want to put out like a product that people would enjoy that enhances their experience with
9034440	9041000	the show and not just because, you know, we want to go to Disneyland. I mean, I want to go to
9041000	9045480	Disneyland, but I see some folks in chat talking about Patreon and is that something that we're
9045480	9055000	shading or whatever? No. I mean, you need to do what works for you. I personally do not want to
9055000	9063320	go to Patreon because I want to answer to no one with this show other than myself and my co-host.
9063320	9066840	Honestly, though, though, the Patreon thing, I think it used to be like a lot of that was
9066840	9071320	gated by like, I watch a lot of different shows. Most of the shows I watch now, especially on
9071320	9076840	YouTube, have Patreons. And the way they do it is like, you know, we're doing this show for free.
9076840	9081720	If you want to support us, cool. If you don't, that's fine. And I, you know, and that's, that's,
9081720	9084760	that's kind of why I'm taking the approach with Twitch and stuff that I have. And that's,
9084760	9089000	that's totally awesome. Like, again, I'm not shading people to choose to use Patreon.
9089000	9094680	Go for it. That's awesome. I just, again, this is a me thing and my mental block. I feel like
9095480	9101000	when I open it up to someone else financially supporting this show that said people would have
9102200	9106680	a say in, and even though, you know, we do want to open it up to the listeners on stuff,
9106680	9109800	it's still on our terms. Does that make sense? It's still our house.
9109800	9115640	I will say this though, that, and maybe it's a discussion for another day, but I was looking
9115640	9121960	at, there are other YouTubers who use Patreon who take no input for what they do. You know,
9121960	9127640	they don't do the levels they do just as a donation thing. And then may have like the
9127640	9135480	occasional prize for a level or something. But you know, I, I had thought about it. I'm not
9135480	9140520	really, I, I don't think it would affect what we do, but it wouldn't add to what we do right now.
9141240	9145080	I will say this, and I am going to shade something here real quick. I am going to be shady. Get your
9145080	9148360	shade button ready because I'm going to tell you, and this, this is just an answer to the question.
9148920	9154600	The thing that has pissed me off, I mean, pissed me off as a video game podcaster more than
9154600	9160760	anything else in my 15 years of doing this was when I saw that show going to Kickstarter saying
9160760	9165480	they needed $30,000 to do their show. And y'all, y'all can do your own research if you want to
9165480	9171320	know. And I don't know those people. I don't know that show, but I'm just saying on a principle level
9171320	9177640	to say, we need to do a studio or we need to rent a studio space to do this show, or we need the
9177640	9183240	money to travel to Conner. We need $30,000. I'm sorry. And you know, maybe I'm going to get shit
9183240	9187560	for this if this gets back to them, but Oh, well, I'm just going to say from my perspective,
9187560	9191240	as somebody who has never made a dime off this show, who's doing it in the spare room. And so
9191240	9197800	this stuff, you don't need $30,000 to do a fucking podcast. And if you're doing, I mean,
9198840	9205080	I don't know. I just, I think you send the wrong message with that. I want people to feel empowered
9205080	9213080	that they can do a podcast with a fucking iPhone, Android recorder and enthusiasm,
9213080	9216920	if that's all they've got. Yeah. Anyway, that's all I have to say on that. I agree.
9217560	9221880	So that's the, I'll go ahead and wrap up with this email. Sorry if my email contains any mistakes.
9221880	9226520	No, your email was great. Look at all the brands you got us on. I mean, props to you, right?
9226520	9231960	Greetings and thank you for your podcast Lorcan from Germany. Thank you Lorcan, which is a name
9231960	9237400	I don't hear a lot in the email bag. So very good email tonight. All right, moving on. We have two
9238200	9245960	left. Hold on. I think I might be reading these out of order. Nope, I'm not. By the way,
9245960	9250280	background music is great days. Sega Genesis chiptune cover by blast processed.
9250920	9259400	You'll need to download this. So we got a happy 15th music thing. Oh, we did? We did.
9259640	9263880	I didn't run ma. Oh, I didn't. Oh, I got it. That means I got a log in the mail bag over here. Yep.
9263880	9267320	So while you do that, I will pull that up, go to the next one and I'll pull that up. Okay.
9268520	9272120	Hey, OLR. I just wanted to share some of my thoughts about E3.
9274200	9277800	Sony, I wasn't too impressed with Sony's conferences. It had a lot of updates from
9277800	9281800	last year. They didn't have much that was really new this time around. Missing in action, deep
9281800	9287800	down, bloodborne two, DMC five, death stranding, gameplay, et cetera. I did appreciate the fact
9287800	9294280	that Sony showed the games and stuck to it. Microsoft 4K, 4K, 4K, 4K, 4K. I was impressed
9294280	9300600	with the Xbox one X somewhat with a $500 price point. It seems that Microsoft is trying to edge
9300600	9306360	out the competition by throwing out hardware specs to justify their gaming thug. What I thought was
9306360	9313960	interesting was that the systems would have 12 gig of a GDR five Ram. Um, the 10 80 TI graphics
9313960	9320440	card has 11 gigs and costs around at least $700. As you said in the last episode, Rob,
9320440	9325320	I'm happy that I see 4k a lot more in action, but I don't think I need the Xbox one X to do it.
9326360	9331320	Guess now is a good time to future proof my PC for 4k gaming.
9331320	9333800	You and I are in the same mindset. Who's this emailer?
9333800	9336440	I'll tell you when to finish. Okay. Tristan.
9336440	9340520	Okay. Tristan, Tristan, you and I are in a very similar mindset. I don't see the need for the
9340520	9345560	Xbox one as much as I do. I think that's a great way to put it future proof my PC from where gaming
9345560	9350840	is going. That's a great way to put it to be fair for a 4k machine for 99. You can't build a 4k
9350840	9354840	machine for four 99. And that's totally, yeah, exactly. You got to make a choice.
9356360	9360200	Nintendo. I didn't get around to seeing their presentation, but I was very impressed.
9360200	9365240	There are two Metro titles coming out, Metro prime four and Metro two return of Samus remake
9365240	9369240	as a shame it's coming to the 3DS only and not the switch.
9369240	9372680	It seems that they are listening to their fans and at least it's something
9372680	9376200	Rob. I know it's not F zero, but Hey, we'll take what we can get. Haha.
9376920	9381480	I thought that the developer digital press conference was amazing. It pretty much showed
9381480	9387160	their new upcoming titles while taking potshots at the gaming industry. It's worth a watch.
9387160	9390760	I missed the Devolver thing. Did you watch it? I just saw some of the live tweets about it.
9391320	9395560	They had it. Okay. So I missed it, but it was, it was like a 30 minute show.
9396520	9400520	It was like a fake show making fun of the industry. Then they have this like several
9400520	9406040	hour long pre pre-show that was absolutely annoying, but I mean,
9407640	9412920	neat, I guess that they're poking fun at shows, but like we all do that. So yeah,
9412920	9417240	I like the sassy stuff though. I'll go, but I like shady stuff. It's why I watch drag race.
9417240	9420120	Very much like Tim and Eric adult swim kind of stuff.
9420520	9427160	All right. My game of the show is dragon ball fighter Z. Yes, yes, yes, yes. It pretty much
9427160	9432200	took the Marvel versus Capcom formula, tweaked it and made it look so damn good. Everyone that's
9432200	9436520	played it fell in love with it instantly. It's got a lot of nominations from the gaming press
9436520	9441240	and was truly well-deserved. The fact that our system works is behind the development makes me
9441240	9445720	feel confident that they will put, pull out all the stops to ensure the consumer has their hand
9445720	9450520	on a complete and competent product. Unlike street fighter five shade button. There's no
9450520	9456200	battle toads. In addition, the game is gunning for an Evo slot next year and I hope it gets it.
9456200	9463160	Oh my God. I would kill. I I'm gagging already. This is great. I did you ever watch any of the
9463160	9466920	gameplay for it? And I'm not really just saying this because I'm on a dragon ball kick. I think
9466920	9472520	this game would have been enough to get me back on a dragon ball kick. So, and I played the shit show
9472520	9479640	that was, you know, the GT game back in the day and sold it. SSG-100 Matt in chat says, I hope
9480360	9485160	Dragon Ball Fighter Z outsells Marvel versus Capcom Infinite. It could, honestly. Yeah, it
9485160	9491560	could. I wouldn't be mad about that at all. I mean, I'll be honest. I saw the, well, the next
9491560	9498200	part actually is addressed to me, so I'll do my, my thoughts on that. Dark Sakura, as a fighting
9498280	9502360	game player like myself, what's your take on Marvel versus Capcom Infinite so far?
9502360	9506920	The story demo that was released left a bad taste in my mouth, but for those who played the E3 build
9506920	9511240	had something different to say. Looks fun, but the visuals look like ass. They have three months
9511240	9516440	to polish it and I feel that a delay would be best to clean up. It won't happen, but that's how it
9516440	9525480	goes. It could have looked better. I wasn't really too mad at the art style. I didn't hate it. I did
9525480	9530600	have some issues with, like, how are these people back in the same universe again? And I fucking am
9530600	9537160	sick of Ultron, so. It's because Ultron merged both their universe. With Sigma? Yeah, he merged with
9537160	9542360	Sigma, which merged their two universes. So, like, for example, one of the levels that's in the story
9542360	9552520	demo is Asgard and X's world. It's like, they call it X-Guard. Okay. Well, I think the, the concept
9552520	9556840	behind it is really cool and my love for fighting games isn't necessarily just because you can
9556840	9560760	fight, but I love the stories that go along with them and I love the characters in it.
9560760	9566840	I think you can make a fighting game that could be fun, but if the characters aren't as fleshed out,
9566840	9573960	like, don't have a story or motivation, then they're, they kind of go below 2D for me. You
9573960	9581800	know what I mean? And so I was, I saw the trailer for it. I thought some of the things were kind of
9581800	9586120	dumb, but I love the cast of characters I saw so far. You know, especially, you know,
9586120	9591080	Strider Hear You has been probably one of my mainstays in all the Marvel versus Capcom games.
9591080	9594520	I blame my husband for that because my husband's favorite game for a long time was Strider.
9596120	9604440	However, I next saw Dragon Ball FighterZ after that and I was like, oh, that kind of blows it
9604440	9612680	away. So I will play it. I mean, certainly we're going to have it in my house. It's,
9612680	9618840	it's kind of goes without saying, but I am not as excited about it as I might've been seeing what
9618840	9625320	else is coming out and hearing. So I didn't play the demo. I didn't play it. I did watch though,
9625320	9631080	a lot of the movies for it. So I can't really base a judgment on what I haven't played,
9631880	9637960	but just looking side by side reading reviews. And again, I'm very picky with reviews. I would
9637960	9644440	rather form my own opinion, but I'm, I'm still, I'm still happy about it. I'm still a little bit
9644440	9652120	excited, but I'm more excited for Dragon Ball. So that's my thing on it to answer that question.
9652120	9656200	So thanks. Oh, go ahead. Sorry. I was just going to finish up the email. What were you saying? No,
9656200	9660520	go ahead. I have a random thought. Thanks so much for reading my email. I truly enjoy hearing you
9660520	9665000	guys over the past decade and congrats on your 15th anniversary of orange challenge radio.
9665000	9669640	Keep up the awesome work and just know you have a loyal listener from Maryland,
9669640	9671800	Tristan. Thank you. What up Maryland?
9674360	9677560	So they know they're in chat. They're still trying to say, Oh, is he going to take a bet?
9677560	9682200	You know, the Dragon Ball fighter Z will sell more than Marvel vs Capcom where the tingle
9682200	9688760	cost. Listen, that's over. We are more bets. No more bets. If I can lose enough weight where I
9688760	9694760	can pull that off sexy like, then sure. Why not? But like, it's going to be, he'll just do it for
9694760	9701080	fun. If he loses that much weight, just like beef up the package. You're not going to want to see
9701080	9706040	that. Did you download the file? I did. So I believe this is an audio message similar to what
9706040	9711720	we got from game buoy, except this one came in via the mailbag other than Dropbox. So we will listen
9711720	9716120	to it and I'm taking a big risk, not screening this first, but we'll listen to it now.
9719080	9725160	Hey everybody. This is DJ Van Ness. I'm here with Ari Rockefeller and Mako Chan.
9725960	9732520	We're getting together real quick to wish Orange Lounge Radio 15 years of excellence. So it's their
9732520	9738360	15th anniversary. So figure we get together, jump on Skype and just say some kind words.
9739000	9745480	Does that sound good? Yeah, it sounds great. Okay. Sure. Well, Mako, you sound pretty happy.
9746360	9756520	Yeah, I'm grumpy catting it. Fine. Let's do this. So Rob, Jamie, Matt, happy anniversary.
9758440	9762920	If it wasn't for you guys, it wouldn't be an anime jam session. So I'm thankful for that
9762920	9768760	and all that good stuff. So have a great anniversary and have many, many more.
9768760	9773320	Anime jam session owes its origins to
9773320	9777320	Orange Lounge Radio. So what we do is partially your fault.
9778200	9785320	And we're sorry, but not really. Love you guys.
9787000	9791320	You see what I put up with every week. All right.
9791320	9799160	That was a very cute message. Thank you very much. Even if Mako Chan didn't sound
9799160	9803800	like she wanted to be there, but I just, I like that. Sorry for waking you up.
9803800	9809000	Yeah, it's not like I woke her up. Hearts you guys. No, I love, no, that was great. Thank you
9809000	9813800	so much. Hearts and hearts. I've said this before, those types of compliments about
9814440	9818760	what you guys did kind of showed me that we could do our own show and, you know, the anime jam
9818760	9824200	session and so forth. And the other shows that I've heard this from is just, there is no greater
9824200	9829480	compliment, I don't think, to what we do here at OLR than hearing that. So thank you. Thank you
9829480	9838280	very much for that. So, all right. Is that it for emails tonight? All right. Participate at
9838280	9842680	OrangeLoungeRadio.com. You can always send us an email for our next show in two weeks. Because
9842680	9846680	again, I didn't state this at the beginning of the show, but I've said it a million times before,
9846680	9852520	we will not be here next week. Our reward for 15 years of OLR? A fucking night off.
9853400	9857240	And actually, again, Dark Sakura is going to be at San Francisco Pride. I'm going to be at Chicago
9857240	9862120	Pride. So we are traveling all over, over next weekend, but we'll be back in two weeks just in
9862120	9867000	time for the 4th of July weekend. Won't that be fun? All right. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
9867000	9870200	if you want to send us an email for that show. We do have some more stories to get through.
9870200	9873560	However, since we are at nine o'clock here, which means midnight on the East Coast, and we still
9873560	9876840	haven't even got to calls, I do want to ask that we hit the fast forward button on these stories.
9876840	9879640	So we just have three stories here. We're going to just do the bullet points from these stories,
9879640	9884840	please. Loki. Yeah. So Microsoft is putting out, they're redoing their whole avatar system. And so
9884840	9891880	they've got brand new avatars that are, you know, 4K ready, HDR, all that fun stuff. But what's
9891880	9897880	kind of cool about these though, is they've really amped up the models in there. So for example,
9897880	9901880	they're going to have different body types, even some that encompass individuals that might be
9901880	9906280	disabled as well. So like some of the ones that are showing off, they had a girl with, you know,
9906280	9911080	an artificial arm, they had someone in a wheelchair. And I gotta say, these avatars look
9911080	9915320	fucking awesome, you know, compared to like some of the stuff that they had before. That's how I
9915320	9919800	kind of really wish that Nintendo would step up, like the Miis and stuff to something like this,
9919800	9923000	because honestly, these look fantastic. So props to Microsoft.
9924280	9928040	Atari is working on something as well. And some of you guys have been shouting this out in chat.
9928040	9932520	This is different from what Dark Soccer talked about earlier. The actual company Atari is making
9932520	9938280	something called an AtariBox. There's a video over at AtariBox.com that's teasing a brand new Atari
9938280	9943640	project. Some folks have reached out to Atari and they have said, yes, it is real. There is actually
9943640	9948200	a partner involved, although they have not said who that partner is. So no idea what this is. I
9948200	9952360	mean, some folks have speculated it could be like an Android-based console, although chances are,
9952360	9956840	whatever the hell it is, it's probably going to have a bunch of Atari games preloaded on it.
9956840	9961480	I guess maybe, maybe an evolution of those. Remember the Coleco Chameleon was supposed
9961480	9968520	to use the old Jaguar shells? Maybe this is going to use Jaguar shells as well.
9968520	9972040	Well, just let's hope this ends up a little bit better. Jamie, last but not least,
9972040	9978440	you have something for us, I think. Yeah, it's about Microsoft and our robot overlords.
9979720	9986440	Basically, Microsoft researchers are testing AI and machine learning. And so they've created an
9986440	9995880	AI system that can hit the, in theory, the maximum score for the Atari 2600 adaption of Ms. Pac-Man.
9995880	10004360	No human has done this, but the machine, our robot overlord, tested by reinforcement learning,
10005240	10008920	has hit the high score. So try that Billy Mitchell.
10009560	10017800	Nice. So not only can robots name hamsters, but they can get the high score on Ms. Pac-Man.
10017800	10023800	But can they do both at the same time? Yes, they can actually.
10024920	10030440	Right. The Skype line is open if you want to give us a call. 1-877-GAMELR, the old-fashioned way,
10030440	10036040	but I think y'all are on Skype now. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. Just think,
10036040	10041720	when we get the Discord, we'll be able to open it up so we can do group calls, if that's the thing.
10041720	10044360	I don't know. I don't know if that's the thing we actually want to do. More like, oh shit.
10044360	10048520	Yeah, right. All right, let's go to the phone. Oh my God, we've got a million things coming in.
10048520	10053000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Hey, this is Acteft. Hi, Acteft. What's on your
10053000	10061000	mind, buddy? Oh, hi. Hola todos. First of all, well, congratulations on your 15 year,
10061000	10065720	on your quinceanera. Thank you very much. My dress is lovely tonight. I'm sorry you couldn't see it.
10067000	10076520	Well, since it's a quinceanera, I definitely have to do this. So sorry for the bad singing,
10076520	10081640	but yeah. Yay, we get the quinceanera song. I'm so excited. Yes, please. Not really the quinceanera,
10081640	10086600	but the manganitas. So here it goes.
10109000	10109960	Rob was dancing.
10109960	10113480	I was. I was doing a little dance and you all are blessed that you couldn't see it.
10117480	10121000	Remember we were going to do periscopes of certain parts of the show. Let's all be thankful
10121000	10125320	that didn't happen. Thank you very much. That takes guts to sing here on the program. So thank
10125320	10130920	you very much. Yeah, I'm well aware. You're getting some bravos from our chat room and
10130920	10134600	come on Nogas says yes a las muchachas bonitas.
10137080	10144120	Very well done. Well, again, I want to thank you all for being there every Sunday or most
10145240	10153080	Sundays. And I already said on Twitter and Facebook, but you guys have inspired so many
10153080	10160760	people, including me. A year ago, I started my podcast and you guys were pretty much the
10160760	10168520	inspiration for it, along with other podcasts like Black Wolf, Game Buoy, Travis Donovan, and then
10168520	10177080	BSL. But again, you guys have inspired so many people to do what you always say, to share our
10177080	10184840	voice. And I really want to thank you for that. It's really, really great that you do it for love
10184840	10194760	and you speak your voice without any sort of restriction. And again, you're an inspiration
10194760	10200360	for all of us. I want to thank you very much for that. And thank you for what you do in that. And
10200360	10206120	I know you were voicing in chat earlier that you're learning that it can take time to build
10206120	10211240	up an audience for your show, but you are still working at it and not letting that go. And, you
10211240	10216760	know, never lose sight of that, that even on the darkest days, the days you're going up against the
10216760	10224040	Super Bowl and the Oscars, sometimes it's about just kind of like the fact that going through the
10224040	10228280	motions of doing the show and being there and having a good time with your friends, if nothing
10228280	10235160	else, you know? Yeah, especially that. I have lots of fun with my friends talking, doing stupid
10235160	10241640	stuff. But yeah, it's really bad. And if people like that, I'm happy with it.
10242520	10246680	That's the absolute right attitude to have, Act F, and I think you'll have much success if you
10246680	10251560	keep that attitude on. Well, again, thanks. Thanks for everything.
10251560	10254440	Thank you, Act F. I really, really appreciate that. I'm gonna let you go to try to squeeze
10254440	10257560	in some calls because we're getting a lot tonight. But thank you. Have a good one. And thanks for the
10257560	10260120	song. Thanks for having me. Gracias.
10260920	10262920	No, no. Bye-bye.
10264040	10267880	All right, lighting up tonight. Who would have thought? Let's go to another call.
10267880	10269400	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?
10270200	10272280	Hey, Ralph. This is Reggie Nader.
10272280	10273560	Hey, buddy. What's on your mind tonight?
10274520	10280040	Well, since this is your 15-year anniversary, I just want to call in and say thank you for
10281400	10283000	doing your show all these years.
10283000	10283880	Thank you for being here.
10284840	10293720	Yeah, it's honestly one of the better shows that I've been listening to. And in fact,
10294760	10301160	between your show – well, I already said this in chat, but I might as well see on the call – it's
10301160	10310520	your show and Bobby's show are what inspired me to get my original PC that way I can listen to
10311400	10313160	your shows that way.
10313160	10318840	I was going to say, I seem to recall in the early days of OLR, you were talking about how
10318840	10324280	your most current system was a Nintendo 64. And now you've come a long way in being able to kind
10324280	10329000	of tell us like, hey, hey, this game's free. Go get it while it's free. And hey, hey, have you
10329000	10333880	played Magic the Gathering 2014 yet? And it's like, you've come quite the long way yourself
10333880	10339240	from the, I only have a Nintendo 64. Am I still a gamer? To which, may I remind you, we said,
10339240	10340200	yes, of course you are.
10340840	10351880	Yeah, speaking of which, your comment there brings up my next point. Just before my transition
10351880	10361080	from console gaming to PC gaming, I remember you constantly talking about Steam and the summer sales
10361080	10369400	and this sale, that sale, and yada, yada, yada. And that was largely the reason why
10370520	10377320	I said, you know, to hell with replacing my PS3. I might as well, if anything, go get a PC
10378040	10385480	and at least try out the Steam thing, see if it's any good. And well, you know what happened
10385480	10389560	since then, you know, constantly calling your show and Bobby's show and talking about,
10389560	10391160	I've created a monster.
10392680	10397880	Yeah, well, I was going to say, no, I'm a Steam addict and you're my dealer.
10398200	10404920	Great. That makes me feel real good. No, I, no, it does. I mean, the fact that, you know,
10405560	10410120	that shit ain't cheap. And the fact that like, based on our recommendation, you drop that kind
10410120	10415960	of money on that, that's, that just, it just blows my fucking mind. Like I, it really does.
10416840	10422040	Yeah. Well, bear in mind, you know, well, not to go into the whole deal
10423000	10429480	in tangent, because that's not why I called, but in full fairness now, yes, I do have a lot of gains,
10429480	10436680	but I very, very few, you know, that might pay a full price. And in fact, a lot of which I got
10436680	10442280	for free. So, you know, it really doesn't, didn't cost me as nearly as much money as it did,
10442280	10449640	how it did seem. So, but, you know, ultimately my point is, you know, thanks to your recommendation,
10449640	10456680	I'm enjoying the crap out of PC gaming and there's very, very low incentive for me to go
10456680	10463000	back to console gaming. So I have, you have to think for that. Well, on one side, I want to be
10463000	10467800	thankful that we helped, but at the other hand, I'm not ready to push off console gaming so
10467800	10472760	quickly, but I get your, I get it, RageNator. I do. I get it from your perspective. So,
10473400	10476440	you know, thank you. Everybody's got to do what's right for them at the end of the day.
10476520	10481080	So yeah, yeah. Yeah. Don't get me wrong. There, there are some console exclusive,
10481080	10486120	blast, sorry, getting tongue-tied. Yeah. There's a couple of console exclusive games that
10486120	10493080	I loved on PS3 and Xbox 360 and so on and so forth that I kind of sort of missed. Like,
10493880	10499000	I know I talked about a lot, you know, back in the day about Super Stardust HE. I used to play
10499000	10506760	the BGS inside of that, but you know, that being said, you know, I've given a choice between
10506760	10513000	console gaming and PC gaming. I think for most of why I'll stick with PC gaming. So, I mean,
10513720	10518200	it's not like I'm hurting for games. There is nothing wrong with that. Any other quick
10518200	10521000	thoughts? I've got a, I got a lot of calls to get through tonight. So anything else you want to get
10521000	10528120	out? Uh, no. And hopefully, um, I'll just end with this. Hopefully you'll, you'll, you guys
10528120	10536920	will still have plenty more years to come. And I swear to God, Rob, if you quit OR anytime soon,
10536920	10541320	I'm going to reach through the internet and slap the Jesus out of you. You know what? We've given
10541320	10547240	you almost 700 episodes so far. So not if I do it first. When we're ready to end this show,
10547560	10552040	we deserve it. Like, I'm not, I'm not, again, I'm not trying to sound like too ego or anything like
10552040	10558280	that, but there is going to come a time and it's not going to be easy for anybody, but believe me,
10558280	10561240	it will be the hardest for us. But people are going to read into that and be like,
10561240	10567080	oh, he already knows. No, we don't. I'm just saying maybe it'll be 20 years from now. I
10567080	10573320	don't fucking know, but it's going to end someday. So, you know, but hopefully it won't be any time
10573400	10575800	soon. No, no time sooner. We plan in it. That's for sure.
10576600	10581240	I, well, I'll have to go. So I'm sure all the people want to call it in and say,
10581240	10585720	congrats to you guys, but thanks for everything. Thanks for taking my call.
10585720	10588760	No worries. Thank you, buddy. Take care. Yep. You too. All right. Bye.
10589720	10593960	All right. Let's get to another call. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
10593960	10597080	This is Brad from pod culture. Hi, my friend. It's good to hear from you. What's up?
10597880	10602520	I'll just call and say, congratulations guys on 15 years.
10602520	10606600	Thank you very much. You know, you, you're, you're not such a, a child yourself when it
10606600	10609880	comes to podcasting. I know. So that means a lot coming from a peer.
10610680	10614360	Well, it was, uh, I guess I came into it about a year after you guys started.
10615880	10618840	So yeah, you've been doing this quite a long time yourself.
10618840	10623080	Oh no, just listening to you guys a couple of years after that before we actually started.
10623080	10626040	Gotcha. Gotcha. Um, well, um,
10626040	10629240	anything you wanted to share with listeners tonight or how are things been going for you?
10630520	10634440	One things are going good, but, uh, no, they just want to call and say thanks. Cause, uh,
10634440	10637800	probably you guys have been the biggest influence on our show. You know, we're
10637800	10641400	three or four folks sitting around shooting the shit about stuff that we like. So, uh,
10642920	10648600	And it's, it's a fun, it's a fun show that you guys do. So that's quite the compliment to hear.
10649480	10653320	Okay. Well, I'll let you get some more calls, but, uh, congrats guys.
10653320	10656360	Well, thank you, Brad. I really appreciate that. And there's a new episode of pod
10656360	10660520	culture tomorrow at vogue, right? Yeah. It's our, uh, uh, take on wonder woman.
10660520	10663640	So it should be interesting. Three dudes sitting around talking about, uh, uh,
10664200	10668440	superhero and chill. Well, Hey, that's, that's okay. As long as, as long as y'all had great
10668440	10673480	things to say, right? Everybody's great. Yeah, I know. Yeah, no, I, uh, I'm, I really need to
10673480	10677960	see it too, but you know, time. All right. Thank you, Brad. Take care later. Bye.
10678680	10681960	I should. Oh, I should. Damn it. I shouldn't hit the hang up button. Cause I should have
10681960	10686680	said something to him about introducing me to fireball. That's that's something I'm always
10686680	10691640	going to associate Brad with in our relationship with OLRs, how he introduced me to fireball
10691640	10695000	by getting us a big bottle of it here. But anyway, we got another call. So let's get to
10695000	10698520	it higher on orange songs radio. Who's this? Yeah. What's up? This guy, Judo. Hey guys, you know,
10698520	10703080	what's up my friend. Not much. First off happy 15th. Um, I think I've been listening to you
10703080	10708360	guys for maybe 10 years. Thank you. Holy shit. Wow. Yeah. I know it's been a while,
10708360	10713240	but damn, it's another to hear it. Thank you. Yeah. I think I first found you guys in, uh,
10713240	10719560	2007. I think I was like, um, I was feeling, uh, nostalgic for, uh, the G four network. Oh,
10719560	10725800	sure. I looked up Scott. Sure. Finding Scott. I found out all games radio and that led me to,
10725800	10729160	uh, Bobby Blackwell for you guys. And I've been listening to her ever since. So no,
10729160	10732520	that all games partnership was a win-win for all of us, you know, and not like I,
10732520	10736360	like I said earlier in the show, I know things have shifted around, you know,
10736360	10740760	five years ago when we, we, we moved over to VOG network and did our own thing. But,
10740760	10745080	um, I think our partnership with all games was, was so good for both of us. You know,
10745080	10748040	we had an audience, we brought to them, they had an audience they brought to us and it was
10748920	10753480	some fantastic years. Yeah. And what you, what you guys brought to all games was great as well,
10753480	10758840	because like not to, uh, not to knock anyone who, who chooses not to do their show live,
10759560	10762600	you know, like, you know, I know that there's like special situations where, you know,
10762600	10766200	somebody just can't sit there for like two, three hours and do a live show. Sure. But what
10766200	10770200	I really appreciated about your show was that you were, you guys were alive because I was only
10770200	10775720	looking for live shows to listen to, you know? I gotcha. I gotcha. That's what you guys brought
10775720	10779160	to network. But, uh, real quickly, I just wanted to point out to you guys, you guys,
10779160	10784760	uh, spoke earlier about the, uh, PlayStation, not playing nice with the other systems and, uh,
10784760	10788520	Bobby Blackwell, he made a great point on his show. I hope I'm not stealing this thunder. I don't
10788520	10792520	know if he's going to call in. It's our birthday. You can steal a little thunder. It's our
10792520	10797720	birthday. You can steal a little thunder. Well, he mentioned that maybe Sony doesn't want to play
10797720	10802360	is because you would, you would need an Xbox live account to do that in Minecraft stuff. Not,
10802360	10807160	not necessarily with Rocket League or any other games, but with Minecraft, you would need to be
10807160	10812280	connected to Xbox live. Do you need that? Do you need that on, but like, I know when I play my
10812280	10816120	PlayStation version of Minecraft now and I'm online, I don't need that, but that's, that's
10816120	10820440	just because to connect to the other side of it, because it is Minecraft, you would,
10820440	10824120	that would be the universal place. Whereas, okay, I guess I can kind of see where this is going
10824120	10828920	because like on, um, when it was Final Fantasy 11, everything was through play online, but ironic
10828920	10833640	because play online was a Sony venture. And that did, it was like half Sony and that did show up
10833640	10840200	on 360. However, it was a different time in games. Microsoft was desperate to have to partner with
10840200	10843960	Square Enix. So they let them get away with merch. So it was a different time. Uh, and I
10843960	10846520	think that's important for people to remember when we talk about this whole, well, they've
10846520	10850200	done it before. Why don't they, it was just a very, very different time for Microsoft.
10850200	10855560	Um, so yeah, I mean, and even through Final Fantasy 14, you're logging in through the,
10855560	10859640	the play, uh, it's not play online, but it's like a different Square Enix gateway that you're
10859640	10864520	logging in through. So I kind of get it in that regard that if Xbox live is to be that gateway,
10865880	10869880	Sony might have some reservations with that. Yeah. You know, you don't want to catch those,
10869880	10874520	those, uh, Microsoft germs. Yeah. So yeah, it makes sense. It is a little weird is the word.
10874520	10878360	No, I think Bobby has some good insight there, but hopefully, hopefully they find a way to,
10878360	10882520	to work around it or something, or maybe just connect to Xbox live as a guest or like some
10882520	10887160	of the mobile games or even like websites too, where you can log in, you know, you can log and
10887160	10893000	say like through Minecraft or something.com, but log in with your Xbox live login or log in with
10893000	10897560	your Nintendo network login or something like that, you know, where they have multiple options.
10897560	10904360	My worry though, is are they requiring Xbox live gold to play cross play with? Oh, that would suck
10904360	10911160	because you have to log in the live. Maybe if you're on Microsoft. Yes. But if you're on a
10911160	10915720	tablet, tablets don't fucking have anything like that. Or are you saying that because you'd be
10915720	10923240	logging with my Xbox live, you would have to have it. I don't know. Well, I know, I know I have that.
10923720	10927400	I have the tablet version of Minecraft and you have to, uh, they have that stupid, uh,
10927400	10931800	what is it realms or some crap? Yeah. They gotta be a part of it. That's how,
10931800	10936920	that's how you're playing cross platform anyways, realms. I think you're all gonna be logging into
10936920	10945000	the servers. We'll see what happens. Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna let you guys go before I leave. I just
10945000	10951080	want to say, uh, hopefully that'll allow, uh, people from Microsoft to, uh, play rocket league
10951080	10955720	because, uh, I came to play video games and, uh, kick some Microsoft fan boy ass. So
10956840	10961240	bring it on, bring it on. All right. Take care of my friend. All right. Later. Bye.
10962120	10967160	All right. Uh, I, Hey, look, I plan on taking every call, so let's get to it. Hi,
10967160	10972040	you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? What's going on, everybody? Hey, Rama, how you doing?
10972040	10978040	I'm doing good. How about y'all? Good. I fucking love that shirt. He's got a, it's Rama express,
10978040	10982600	but it's like Panda express the little, I know you guys anyway. That's great. What's up, buddy?
10983320	10988520	It says at the bottom curse Chinese Springs, but, um, I think y'all, y'all know what time it is.
10988520	10994280	Oh, yes I do. Yes I do. That's right. Holding up a bottle of nickelau vodka.
10994920	10997800	Yes, sir. That's right. Pouring one out. Let's do it.
10998360	11002840	As I'm pouring these three, Rob, like I say, you spoke some real truth and some real words
11002840	11008760	about podcasting. You don't know. I have gotten into arguments with people. We're podcasting,
11008760	11015160	what you got to do and so forth. And as I said in the chat room, when I wake up one day and say,
11016200	11021080	this ain't fun, no more. And my jam session is going to wrap it up. Simple as that.
11021640	11025960	I think it's the same thing for, I think that would, that would also apply here at OLR.
11025960	11029720	I mean, there may be, there may be life things, you know, we, we had it, everybody knows we had
11029720	11035800	a scare seven or eight years ago where Jamie was very likely going to move far away. And that was
11035800	11039800	scary because it was like, are we going to be able to keep doing OLR? I mean, I fought against it.
11039800	11043720	Yeah. And you know, obviously here we are, we're still doing this, celebrating 15 years. So I
11043720	11049160	didn't pan out, but it, it may happen someday. Life takes us to weird fucking places. So you
11049160	11054120	never know. Well, Rob, I do remember the first time I came up to find him that you did say,
11054120	11058040	uh, when Loki was going to have his first born, y'all was going to wrap the show up. And as you
11058040	11062360	can see, it's still going. Did I, that seems so ridiculous that I said that now.
11064280	11068360	Well, and I can say this cause we're old. I was young and stupid then.
11069480	11073240	Aren't we all stupid and I'm old and stupid now.
11076840	11083400	Oh, there's one shot down. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Chug Chug. There's two.
11083400	11089080	I'm sorry. This is horrible radio, but I'm loving it. I'm watching the video.
11089880	11095960	This goes along and say, get over stupid. I'm up here doing shots in my brand new gaming chair.
11095960	11099880	Booze is going all over the place. Marco is going to scream at me,
11099880	11103640	scream at me for spilling the booze. And I don't give a fuck. Drink that shot.
11105320	11106520	There it is. Number three.
11106520	11119160	Yes, sir. Let me finish the call with this. Here's to you. Here's to me. The best of friends
11119160	11125800	will ever be if we should ever happen to disagree. Well, fuck you. And here's to me.
11126920	11130680	I I'm giving you, I'm giving you a high five right up against the Misty can verify. I got
11130680	11135080	you a high five right there up against the monitor right now. Thank you, my friend.
11136760	11143720	I hope to see you soon. Rama see me in October. I know. I know. I got to figure out. I still
11143720	11146360	don't have the official invite to said way, but we'll figure all that out.
11147560	11152120	Oh, we will. Cause Maka will be coming up to record us old farts playing DDR.
11152120	11158200	Can't wait. All right. All right. My friend. I'm gonna let you go. Yeah. Stay fabulous. Thank you.
11158200	11164440	You too. Stay fabulous. All right. Bye. Playing DDR makes me tempted to somehow tag along.
11165000	11170520	You get to take a train on out there. All right. We got one more coming on. Let's see.
11171160	11175240	Hello. Hello. Oh, it's connecting. It's loading. I don't know if you can hear me higher on orange
11175240	11182840	launch radio. Who's this? Hey, Hey, what's up my friend. Oh, hi. You know, just wanted to call in
11182840	11190920	for that 15th anniversary. I, I can think of no, no better way to do this because I don't know if
11190920	11195480	you are the last caller tonight. I'll see if anything else pops in, but I know you were there
11195480	11201320	episode one, dark Tetsuya. And there's only about 11 other people that can say that. So I, I
11201320	11207160	appreciate your support tremendously over the years for sure. Well, what's on your mind?
11208360	11211640	I don't know. I suppose I could talk Nintendo a little bit. Go for it.
11213480	11218360	Yeah. I think I'm really excited for some of the games they got coming out like that Mario Odyssey.
11218680	11221640	Yeah. Hell yeah. When he threw that hat at the T-Rex.
11222280	11225880	Yeah. That's crazy. And I love that theme song. That is.
11227080	11233080	Oh yeah. That's great. And I love that they tied it to Pauline. Who's kind of in some ways is kind
11233080	11238200	of forgotten in the Mario verse. Did you see all the costumes, all the costumes tie back to like
11238200	11243000	obscure costumes that were games. Yeah, no, it's great. It's great. Like there's just so many
11243000	11248120	obscure references that like Nintendo fanboys just are fucking eaten up on a silver fucking platter,
11248120	11256120	just like they did the Wii U. And it's great. You know, I, okay. You remember back when, uh,
11256120	11262120	Jimmy Fallon had Reggie and Shigeru on? Yes. When we were like, Oh, are they trying to hide the
11262120	11268120	loading? Yes. I remember that. I do. Cause we looked like assholes. Yeah. So Miyamoto
11268120	11275720	was wearing this t-shirt of Mario in a samurai costume. Oh, get out. So do you think even all
11275720	11280920	the way back then he was fucking teasing something in Mario Odyssey? Possibly. Yeah. That's what I
11280920	11287080	think. Oh my God. I didn't even think about that, but there's gifts everywhere where you
11287080	11290920	could see that. Cause everybody took that thumbs down into the thumbs up thing and then going
11290920	11296920	and reversing it and all that stuff. I give is everywhere. Yeah. That's hilarious. Well, yeah,
11296920	11300920	I'm definitely looking forward to Mario Odyssey act. Efton chat says, then again, people made a
11300920	11305560	fuzz about Mexican Mario ugh. Good thing. My people actually didn't find that offensive at all.
11305560	11311320	Well, it's the internet. Someone's going to be offended about something. Yeah. Yeah. Well,
11311320	11314760	Dr. C, anything else you want to get out or share with our listeners tonight before we let you go?
11315800	11322120	No, I figure I'll send you guys my regards on behalf of a gamer girl. I appreciate that. And
11322120	11328680	I hope she's doing well. Let me ask this question to end on tonight. Dr. C, just let's pretend
11328680	11331560	nobody else is listening right now. And it's just us having a conversation. Cause I have a
11331560	11336440	serious question to ask you. Has it gotten better since episode one? No.
11339880	11342200	Feel good. Then that means we're doing something right.
11344440	11347960	All right. Take care of my friend. I'm gonna let you go to try and squeeze in more calls.
11347960	11353640	You too. I'll talk to you later. All right. Bye. Yeah. All right. Uh, orange launch radio,
11353640	11357400	all one word on Skype. I think that was all the calls I see popping up,
11357400	11361800	but I'm in a good mood tonight. So I'll, I'll pretty much take all the calls till everybody's
11361800	11368280	done, but thank you so much for the calls that we've received so far. Um, really appreciate it.
11368280	11373160	Can feel the love tonight on our 15th anniversary. Let me check real quick with Loki as I usually do
11373160	11376680	at this point in the show while we see if any other calls pop on. Do we have any last minute
11376680	11381800	stories? No, no, no. All right. I guess, I guess we did cover most everything anyway.
11381800	11386840	And it is about nine 30. So at this point, I think no as much as orange lounge, I'll have to
11386840	11392520	roll that over to episode 700 because we are at nine 30. It is getting late and you know,
11392520	11397880	we do have to work tomorrow and fortunately, and Misty's got a train to catch. So we do have to
11397880	11402680	wrap up tonight, but, uh, I want to thank you guys so much again for your support. And, um,
11402680	11407240	yeah, I'm not gonna keep elaborating cause I will make myself cry and I'm not here to
11407240	11412520	do that tonight. So I'm just going to say just a big general. Thank you so much for
11412840	11417400	all of it for all of this. We're not crying. You're crying. That's right. We're not crying.
11417400	11421480	You're crying. Um, I'm crying because it's going to be while before I see Misty again,
11421480	11425880	but I want to thank you for being here, Misty and celebrating our 15th anniversary with us.
11425880	11430200	And plus your support over the years, you've been, you know, I know, I know you haven't been there
11430200	11435960	since episode one, like dark Tetsuya, but dammit, you might as well have been, I think if you knew
11435960	11440600	about it, then you probably would have been. So I really appreciate that probably. Well,
11441160	11445160	I did get in before a hundred, so I'm still pretty damn good. Yeah. Still to say you were
11445160	11449720	OLR in the double digits, it's still pretty good. Uh, in the pre podcast days, even, I mean,
11449720	11454920	the, the highest we ever got in the pre podcast days was we did have an episode where a hundred
11454920	11458920	people were listening and it was because we had that Akira Yomoka track from DDR. That was the
11458920	11465320	night that that was actually in some ways. And I think we have listener, live listener caps. We
11465320	11469240	had live listener caps and we hit the cap on life 365 that night with that. And that was a whole
11469240	11474520	nother reason why we had to change our plan, but, um, just a walk down memory lane real quick
11474520	11479640	that night in some ways was really transformative for the show because there was people that stuck
11479640	11486520	around for that. And then there was more that came after that. Um, there was the, um, DDR ultra
11486520	11493320	mix for previews that we got to do here. I don't think it was, yeah, it was, it was remixed or
11493320	11498840	so, but I remember ultra mix for specifically, um, you know, that the fact that we had people
11498840	11503480	at Konami, namely still wind, who's no longer with us as we've talked about a few years ago
11503480	11510520	when he passed, um, had faith in our show to be able to do that. And just that got me a vivid foot
11510520	11516440	on DDR freak. And as a long time DDR fan, I can't tell you what that means. I really vouched for
11516440	11520440	you. I know that's, yeah, you were you, well, you, you were a moderator. You were, you were,
11520440	11525720	I know it was funny. It was funny. I can still log into DDR freak forums.
11525720	11530120	Do you know what's funny is Jason tonight was asking me a question for his intro
11530120	11533880	and I didn't know the answer. And do you know where he found the answer? DDR freak. He went
11533880	11539800	into the archives because he, this show started in June of 2002. So he was able to look up what,
11539800	11543800	what was the DDR freak headline in June of 2002. So I just thought that was hilarious and awesome
11543800	11549080	at the same time. So anyway, Misty, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to tangent off of your goodbye,
11549080	11555400	but you should be fucking used to tangents by now. Well, yeah. All right. Well, uh, Misty,
11555400	11561000	anything you want to say to our listeners before we sign off tonight? With the fuckery that's going
11561000	11566120	on with my train out of town, I'm, I'm glad I decided to sign up for the prepaid adult drink
11566120	11572920	option on the connect on the flight I'm connecting to. Amen. Amen. I hope I'm hoping to get a drink
11572920	11578920	on my flight to Chicago as well. So it'll be, it'll be a lot of fun. All right. Well, here it
11578920	11582360	is. You know, I feel like we're going to be celebrating a landmark again in nine weeks when
11582360	11585800	we hit 700 episodes and maybe, I don't know, maybe we'll be able to throw something together for
11585800	11589640	that. That's gonna be the week before labor day, but for now, you know, again, 15 years,
11589640	11593880	it's a long fucking time. Um, Loki, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
11594520	11602200	Um, I'm not playing the Garfield game cause I already uninstalled it because it was breaking
11602200	11606920	our pact, man. It's crap. It's so much crap, but you got to play it just to try it. So you can say,
11606920	11611640	wow, this is crap. I will. I will probably won't last long on my phone either because of the forced
11611640	11618040	AR. World number one on Garfield. Hot and cold in your house. You have to walk around your AR
11618040	11623720	and like find some treasure shit. No, I'm not doing that. Why is the treasure in the litter box?
11623720	11627720	Because litter box is the meme. You're in my heart.
11630760	11636360	I peed you a heart. I almost don't want you to have a final thought tonight, but I suppose
11636360	11643560	with the 15th birthday I'm legally obligated to. So hearts, dark Sakura. Well, apart from the
11643560	11651480	reject false icons, especially in government, um, if you can't be good, be good at it. Amen.
11652440	11656200	Thanks as always for your support, everybody. I say it every week. If you enjoyed what you
11656200	11659800	heard here at orange launch radio, blah, blah, blah, tell a friend, blah, blah, blah,
11659800	11665160	review on iTunes, but they really do go an awful long way and just thanks for your support. It
11665160	11670760	means the world. I don't know what my Sunday nights would look like without orange launch radio.
11671400	11678920	Um, but I'm, I'm just, I'm, I'm happy it's here and I'm happy it exists and I'm happy you all
11679000	11689480	give a fuck. I really am. Oh, I thought you were laughing at me. The final thought flamethrowers
11689480	11694520	and video games are either really good or really bad, but usually good, usually good.
11695640	11700040	Have fun playing video games. You guys we'll see you next time here at orange launch radio.
11700040	11703880	We'll see you in two weeks. Remember no show next week. So you got to make this one last hearts,
