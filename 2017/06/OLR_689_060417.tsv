14000	22000	This week, both Nintendo and Steam announce service changes to accommodate the changing environment that games and we gamers find ourselves in, both companies doing something that few others of their size have.
22000	27000	They're not the only ones in the news this week, this and more starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	49000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 689 of our show for this June the 4th of 2017, moving into our official month of the 15 year anniversary of this program.
50000	59000	My name is Rob Roberts, here with you every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black will show at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOGnetwork.com
59000	66000	and by my side, as she has been for the last 15 years, I've watched her grown up from a grown up to a growner up.
66000	69000	It's DarkSakura and Jamie Summers.
69000	73000	You're such a dork. Oh my god.
74000	79000	I didn't know how else to phrase that, but if you think about it, like 15 years, that's a very long time.
79000	82000	Some of y'all have grown up in that time.
82000	89000	I know, we always, well not always, but once in a while we'll get those emails from somebody that's like, I listened to you when I was 12.
89000	95000	I listened to you in the 8th grade and first I'm thinking, first off, you shouldn't be listening to this show in the 8th grade.
95000	100000	And then, oh now I'm married and have children and I'm like, oh yeah, that makes me feel like a young butt.
100000	104000	I'm married and still don't have children. And guess what? I'm not going to.
104000	109000	Hey, and guess what? I'm finally married because I'm able to. So there you go, yay.
109000	111000	How about that?
111000	114000	By the way, all of our listeners, happy Pride Month.
114000	118000	Yes, happy Pride Month. Also say hello over there to Techmaster Loki.
118000	121000	It's not always what it's cracked up to be too, the whole marriage thing.
121000	124000	Or the kids too.
124000	131000	Well, see, Alan and I don't really plan to introduce kids into the equation, besides pets. We'll be parents to cats.
131000	133000	Our babies are the best babies.
133000	138000	Exactly. But I don't know, from my perspective, married life really hasn't been that different from what it was before.
138000	143000	But Alan and I were together for seven years. But actually that's one thing everybody in here has in common.
143000	146000	Everybody was with their partner for a very long time before getting married in here.
147000	153000	Dan and I were together for seven years. We went to the courthouse.
153000	160000	Which is what Alan and I did. But you and Nellie were dating when OLR first started, right, Loki?
160000	162000	Yeah, so like five years.
162000	168000	Yeah, but that's still a long time. Most people I know kind of jump into it a year or two years.
168000	172000	I know, like my sister, who then got divorced a year later.
172000	174000	I believe in a long QA period.
175000	178000	Everybody's got to do what works for them. I'm not one to judge what other people want to do.
178000	186000	But some people get married after six months and then they're still together. So it works, whatever works for you.
186000	192000	I am. And also, thanks for the reminder of the whole Pride Month thing. I was well aware of it yesterday. I went to Sacramento.
192000	193000	Oh, did you go downtown?
193000	199000	We didn't go downtown. We were far away from the whole Pride thing. We went to go for my wife's birthday.
199000	207000	But for some reason, Pride's leaking out everywhere. So there was a guy who I assumed was dressed up like Captain Underpants.
207000	215000	He had a cape and underwear and was yelling at a train. So it was either a homeless man or it was the real life Captain Underpants.
215000	222000	There was also, there was Sacramento Pride was yesterday. I didn't go. I went like two years ago.
222000	223000	That was at work.
223000	231000	Yeah. I mean, it's just, well, A, I didn't want to go by myself. Alan had to work. And B, I'm going to be real.
231000	236000	It's kind of just like food trucks and vendors you see at every other fair and stuff.
236000	246000	I like food trucks. If this is what homosexuality is bringing to the table, by God, let's spread it everywhere.
247000	251000	Thank you. Thank you, Loki, for your true allyship. We support you.
253000	264000	Anyway, go to our chat over at live.vagadetwork.com. Let's see. Bobby is pointing out that he's getting married next March and no kids.
264000	268000	It's right. Him and Jennifer. He's and Jennifer and I have only been together three years. That's still, that's still quite a while.
268000	271000	So there's still a reasonable QA period.
271000	278000	Yes. It is a good incubation character. And it's also important. I approve of Jennifer, which is also a very important part of this whole equation.
278000	285000	Right. That, that I should be able to approve whoever Bobby's going to marry. Right. But I definitely approve of Jennifer. I think she's great.
285000	293000	So anyway, let's, let's get off the marriage topic and let's talk a little bit about it because it is a video game show. I want to talk about video games.
293000	302000	Our pal YYR is going to join us tonight. He was going to be here in studio. Wasn't able to make it here live. Plans changed.
302000	307000	So we're going to have him still to just check in and see what's going on with his stuff.
307000	312000	We're going to check in with him a little later in the show, probably towards the beginning of part B. If you don't know why YYR.
312000	316000	I mean, he, he, he emails the show pretty frequently and, and, and calls in here and there too.
316000	324000	But very important to note, he has also fully realized a couple of orange lounge radio dream games.
324000	332000	So, and I'm not sure. Can you still buy this on 360 or did they finally shut that down? The XNA games?
332000	337000	Did they finally close that close that down? Well, I don't, I don't know if it's still there and I'll have to ask him,
337000	342000	but bungee ferret tossing on the Xbox 360 was, was an idea that started here on the show.
342000	346000	Not one of the backwards compatible games that, you know, they keep putting forth.
346000	350000	It'd be nice to see some backwards. Billy support for bungee ferret toss.
350000	355000	It would be, it would be nice to ask Microsoft about that or something, but yeah.
355000	362000	So there's, there's that. And then on the PlayStation Vita for a very short time before they shut that down,
362000	369000	you were able to get a game called Pixel Poops, which he had to rename from Pixel Shits was what,
369000	374000	and yes, these things actually happened on our show where we were throwing around ideas out there and, and this happened.
374000	379000	And YYR is correcting us. You can still buy those on the Xbox indie games.
379000	380000	Until September.
380000	381000	Yep.
381000	385000	Not, not, I know the Vita one's long because that was only like he said when he put it out.
385000	386000	That's PlayStation Mobile, yeah.
386000	389000	Yeah, he was like, you only have like six weeks to buy it and then it's, it's gone.
389000	393000	So, uh, okay. So it's, so the, the window is closing.
393000	398000	So YYRs in chat if you want to say hi to him early, but we'll be, uh, we'll be talking to him a little later in the program.
398000	403000	Uh, meanwhile, we're on the Eve, essentially our next show.
403000	404000	The Eve three.
404000	406000	The Eve three. That's right.
406000	414000	We're spot in the middle of, uh, the, the E3 celebration next week because, uh, Bethesda's press conference is happening literally during the show next week.
414000	419000	We're going to have to do that whole thing where we kind of stop, do the press conference, then start again.
419000	421000	Um, and we'll do that next week.
421000	426000	But, uh, you know, this week or this E3, things are happening very early.
426000	429000	You know, we have EA is going on Saturday this year.
429000	431000	We're going all the way back to Saturday, right?
431000	432000	Yeah, I guess.
432000	435000	EA is Saturday and then Microsoft is Sunday morning.
435000	438000	That's a lot earlier than we're used to E3 week.
438000	440000	So that's going on as well.
440000	445000	So we'll, we'll kind of know, you know, some of the big E3 stuff by the next episode.
445000	451000	Granted, we'll still have to wait for Nintendo's presentation and Sony's presentation.
451000	454000	And I'm sure the PC gaming expo will have plenty to get excited about.
454000	458000	So I'm not as old in the watching that for me three times.
459000	470000	But anyway, I thought this would be a good time to talk about either our E3 predictions or our E3, what you'd like to see.
470000	472000	And I'm opening this up to our chatters as well.
472000	477000	Of course, again, live.vognetwork.com because we always tape live on Sunday nights.
477000	482000	What is it that you'd like to see at E3 or what is your prediction?
482000	485000	Let us know which you're kind of talking about here.
485000	492000	So this is, this is a thing I'm sure a lot of your podcast pals are going to be talking about this week is what are the big old predictions?
492000	496000	So Loki, I'm sure you've got things to say.
496000	499000	I mean, I'm going to be as vague as possible.
499000	501000	Is this a prediction or is this what you want to see?
501000	502000	I would like to see.
502000	503000	Okay.
503000	506000	I would just like to be excited by something or surprised by something.
506000	511000	Because that's really the big thing is like getting in the big shock, like, Oh my God, I wasn't expecting that.
511000	512000	That's amazing.
512000	515000	I would like that kind of moment in something, please.
515000	516000	That would be...
516000	519000	Are we talking about like, are we talking about like Sony two years ago?
519000	521000	I'm talking about like, yeah, anything.
521000	525000	I mean, just like Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Shenmue 3, Last Guardian, like...
525000	527000	Just like some really exciting stuff.
527000	529000	I mean, I don't know what it really would be at this point.
529000	533000	Like, like I was even going back today at some of this stuff.
533000	540000	Like for example, Kotaku does this thing where they kind of before E3 each year say, okay, what did they show last year?
540000	544000	What of those promises that they made, what did they actually follow through with?
544000	550000	And it's like most of the stuff that they showed at Sony's thing, it's like, this shit was sewn like last year, the year before last.
550000	551000	And it's not out yet.
551000	555000	Sony, yeah, Sony has a history of very long trajectories with the things they announced.
555000	557000	They're announcing things that are way out.
557000	561000	I mean, they finally delivered on Last Guardian and...
561000	566000	Well, Last Guardian and also, what was the last one that came out?
567000	569000	Fuck, I can't remember the name now.
569000	570000	Horizon Zero Dawn.
570000	572000	I mean, that was pretty good.
572000	574000	And it makes me excited about the other stuff that they have.
574000	577000	It's just, I don't really know what to expect.
577000	581000	Even like Microsoft right now, like fuck, I don't know what the hell they have in the pipeline.
581000	583000	Crackdown.
583000	585000	Crackdown, yeah, I'm expecting that.
585000	589000	But like, aside from that, and maybe probably another Forza game.
589000	592000	I mean, I don't know if they're Halo something.
592000	594000	I mean, I really don't know what they have coming.
594000	597000	Which I guess is a good thing because I'm not really expecting anything, so...
597000	604000	Yeah, I think Microsoft has the potential to do what you want and give you the unexpected this year.
604000	606000	Because we really, I mean, they are such a wild card.
606000	609000	Like, we don't know what fucking direction they're going to Scorpio.
609000	612000	Scorpio could, I mean, I say Scorpio could be anything.
612000	618000	Yes, we have some ideas what Scorpio is, but I mean, it's really wide open for Microsoft right now.
618000	620000	Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
620000	625000	Honestly, like Nintendo, I have no expectations for Nintendo, and I'm sure they're going to meet those just fine.
625000	627000	So, I don't know.
627000	630000	I mean, and then the other few publishers out there.
630000	634000	Honestly, I would like a new Ridge Racer.
634000	636000	Let's just announce a new Ridge Racer.
636000	638000	That's what, that's my hopeful thing I'd like to see.
638000	643000	Because honestly, yeah, I know they did some really shit releases of Ridge Racer and that kind of franchise.
643000	648000	But come on, you can bring it back and just like do a really kick-ass racing year.
648000	650000	And I don't understand why they can't do that.
650000	652000	They're not incapable of doing that.
652000	654000	So, that's what I'd like to see.
654000	658000	Because we've had several console launches with no Ridge Racer, and that's a crime.
658000	660000	Okay.
660000	662000	StarSocker, I'm going to go to you.
662000	663000	Predictions or what you'd like to see?
663000	668000	My prediction is that all of the companies except for Nintendo are not going to release anything original.
668000	673000	Except for Nintendo, who always tries to release something original every couple of, you know,
673000	675000	I'd say at least a couple of things a year.
675000	677000	But it's all going to be more of the same shit.
677000	679000	Okay, hold up, hold up.
679000	683000	Because as much as I want to be a Nintendo as well, I have to call this out.
683000	688000	Because Nintendo's got a very good chance they're going to do Wii U rehashes.
688000	689000	That's not totally original.
689000	691000	We've got ARMS coming, but we already knew about that.
691000	693000	That's those Wii Sports boxings, I mean, you know.
693000	695000	I'll talk about ARMS later, but anyway.
695000	700000	But at any rate, it seems the only one really releasing much in the way of original games has been Nintendo.
700000	704000	It seems the only one really releasing much in the way of original games has been Nintendo.
704000	708000	You know, we have a couple of new IPs, but they're really more of the same genre.
708000	712000	What I'd like to see is something completely different.
712000	719000	I'd like to see a lot more indie developers get their items released on the big consoles.
719000	723000	And actually have the support that was promised instead of just lip service.
723000	724000	That's really it.
724000	726000	Okay.
726000	728000	For me, let's do predictions.
728000	731000	So, I'm going to start, I'll start with Nintendo there a little bit.
731000	737000	So, Nintendo, I do expect that more Wii U ports are inevitable.
737000	743000	I was seeing some of the stuff on other sites, and one of them had like a list of eight games.
743000	745000	Didn't they have like another Pikmin game coming?
745000	748000	They've all but confirmed a Pikmin 4 is in the works.
748000	751000	It's like, I get it that you like Pikmin, but dude.
751000	757000	I mean, honestly, on the scale of all the franchises Nintendo has, Pikmin is like...
757000	758000	Wait on there.
758000	759000	For you.
759000	760000	For me, yes.
760000	761000	What about Metroid?
761000	762000	Come on.
762000	765000	You can't say Metroid is a less popular franchise than Pikmin.
765000	766000	So, okay.
766000	767000	So, here's the thing with the Wii U ports.
767000	770000	Yes, they're going to happen, but there's going to be a limited number.
770000	772000	And there's a lot of what if factors.
772000	778000	I think the one that's guaranteed, for me the biggest, like if I were betting money
778000	781000	on this whole thing, the one I would say this will happen is Smash Brothers.
781000	786000	That's the one that I think is going to happen before any, assuredly compared to any of the others.
786000	789000	I might end up being wrong, but I think that's the one.
789000	790000	Mario Maker.
790000	795000	Mario Maker is probably number two on that list of what would most likely come over from
795000	797000	the Wii U.
797000	804000	I would say Bayonetta 2, and that's part wishful thinking, but also if there is a Bayonetta
804000	809000	3 in the pipeline, as there's been a lot of smoke and fire towards that that could actually
809000	813000	be a thing, and I think we got even a story later on in the show that kind of addresses
813000	814000	that, so I'll save that for then.
814000	819000	But if Bayonetta 3, if there is any truth to that, and that is a big reveal for somebody,
819000	823000	then I think Bayonetta 2 makes a lot of sense to try again on the Switch.
823000	827000	So those are kind of like my top three for what games, but I saw a site somewhere that
827000	831000	was like Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze could be, no, that's not going to be one.
831000	832000	Please no.
832000	833000	That's, no, not that one.
833000	838000	I mean, it's not a bad game, but it's just kind of, you know, we're moving on past that.
838000	847000	But although speaking of retro, I think, my heart says it's going to be a new Metroid
847000	852000	game, but I just, I feel like I'm leading myself into disaster with that whole thing.
852000	854000	It could be an original IP.
854000	858000	As long as it's not an Other M. Which Other M honestly looked good.
858000	859000	Yeah, but Team Ninja got involved with that.
859000	860000	That was a little different.
860000	865000	So I don't think it's going to be Other M. I think it would be Metroid Prime.
865000	867000	Again, if anything else, going to be in that type of vein.
867000	873000	If it's either that or it's a completely original IP because Nintendo has had success
873000	876000	with the original IP thing right now between Splatoon.
876000	878000	I'm sure ARMS is going to do very well for them.
878000	883000	You know, Nintendo is kind of, yes, you can say, LOL, they do Mario and Zelda all the
883000	887000	time, but they are starting to put their feelers out more towards doing new shit.
887000	891000	So maybe they're, maybe retro is going to be able to do something like that.
891000	895000	Then the other thing that I'm kind of like on the fence on is Virtual Console.
895000	898000	And some of the things that have happened this past week that we'll get into later
898000	902000	have made me think maybe Virtual Console is not so guaranteed right now.
902000	906000	But I just, I feel like this is it.
906000	907000	This is the year.
907000	909000	One of two things is going to happen.
909000	915000	Mother 3 is either going to finally happen or that second Densetsu collection is getting
915000	917000	translated, including part three.
917000	918000	It better.
918000	921000	And so, and maybe that's part my heart right there too.
921000	926000	But I really think I feel good that this might be the year that one of those like super
926000	930000	in demand, you know, games of the Super Nintendo.
930000	934000	I know Mother 3 was a Super Nintendo, but you know, kind of same graphic style comes
934000	935000	comes out finally.
935000	937000	So those are those are kind of where I'm at with Nintendo.
937000	941000	But otherwise, I expect the large part of the focus to be on Super Mario Odyssey, because
941000	944000	that's what they want to sell systems through the holiday.
944000	949000	But there there will be one other big AA AAA title this holiday.
949000	954000	But it could be it could be the Smash remaster could be the other thing.
954000	960000	But I just don't see there's not going to be more than two because Nintendo wants to
960000	965000	drag that out for they're not going to do eight fucking Wii U remasters in a year.
965000	966000	That's not happening.
966000	971000	They're going to drag it out to fill up 2018 and on and on and on and so forth.
971000	975000	So that would be that would be my thought.
975000	978000	Oh, and we do know Rabbids cross Mario that's happening.
978000	980000	So that's something we know is happening.
980000	983000	But that's that's also a third party game.
983000	988000	So this also can show that yes, which does have third party support and Mario.
988000	990000	They'll have a little more with that.
990000	992000	Let's talk about Sony for a little bit.
992000	996000	So the interesting thing about Sony is that, yeah, with Sony having announced all this
996000	999000	other stuff that they haven't really released yet.
999000	1004000	I do kind of expect a lot of updates from Sony on projects that we've heard about,
1004000	1006000	but haven't really seen what's coming.
1006000	1008000	I expect we'll see more Death Stranding.
1008000	1010000	We'll see another trailer for that.
1010000	1013000	We'll see another update from The Last of Us 2.
1013000	1015000	God of War.
1015000	1016000	God of War.
1016000	1022000	The other was at the other that other zombie game.
1022000	1023000	I don't remember what it was now.
1023000	1025000	That other game that they showed.
1025000	1026000	They showed it twice during the conference.
1026000	1029000	Remember that they showed it once early on and then they showed it at the end.
1029000	1033000	And we were all kind of thinking this is where Red Dead Redemption 2 was supposed to be.
1033000	1036000	So I think that is going to show up instead.
1036000	1039000	Yeah, I guess Red Dead Redemption will be in one of them, I'm sure.
1039000	1040000	They'll show a trailer for it.
1040000	1042000	It's still not coming out for a long time.
1042000	1045000	It's not, but they want to get the hype with the graphics and everything.
1045000	1049000	So that's definitely showing up at Sony or Microsoft for sure.
1049000	1055000	Whoever gets that DLC exclusive or whatever bullshit that they'll try to fucking pull back.
1055000	1059000	I think there's a very good chance the Mystery Marvel project is going to have some more
1059000	1061000	information come out at E3.
1061000	1065000	The one that Square Enix is working on.
1065000	1068000	I think there's definitely the potential for that.
1068000	1075000	I think if it's true that the Final Fantasy 7 remaster has been delayed, I think you won't see it.
1075000	1079000	I think Final Fantasy 7 remaster is going to take the year off if that is still...
1079000	1080000	I'm kind of fine with that.
1080000	1081000	Yeah, me too.
1081000	1085000	I think you could get a major Kingdom Hearts 3 trailer.
1086000	1092000	They may have the balls to go Kingdom Hearts 3 and then Winter 2019.
1092000	1095000	They might. I don't know. That's a stretch.
1095000	1099000	We will talk about this again soon or we will have an announcement later.
1099000	1100000	That's a big stretch.
1100000	1103000	SSG100Matt says, I hope we find out what the game is in Death Stranding.
1103000	1106000	I think there's a very good chance it will be a gameplay thing.
1106000	1107000	We'll see though. We'll see.
1107000	1108000	No.
1108000	1110000	Yeah, let's see.
1110000	1115000	TigerClawnChat says, what if this Marvel game from Square Enix is some sort of JRPG style game?
1115000	1117000	Except it's not being developed in Japan. It's being developed here.
1117000	1120000	It's Crystal Dynamics is doing it, right?
1120000	1123000	Who did Tomb Raider. They're doing it, right?
1123000	1126000	Black Widow is a very, very bad day.
1126000	1129000	Yes, exactly. Black Widow is a very, very bad day.
1129000	1132000	You know she has a bad day. Everyone else is going to have a bad day.
1134000	1137000	Yeah, we'll see what happens with that.
1137000	1142000	Then there's Microsoft and I really don't know what direction to go with Microsoft.
1142000	1149000	There's such a wild card and obviously Scorpio and why I need one is very important.
1149000	1155000	Of course, there's going to be some game announcements and I do expect that Crackdown is finally going to be out this holiday.
1155000	1157000	If it's not, I don't know what else they've got right now.
1157000	1160000	I can't wait for that. I hope it comes out. I hope it's good.
1160000	1163000	I'm glad that they're taking the time to polish that up.
1164000	1167000	I'm still curious. Remember when that system first came out?
1167000	1171000	It was all about cloud, cloud, cloud, cloud, cloud processing, cloud, cloud this.
1171000	1175000	This is going to make this possible and so I'm curious to see if that's still the case with all this crap.
1175000	1178000	Well, I wouldn't put it past Microsoft though.
1178000	1186000	See, Microsoft on this stage has the ability to talk about more than just the Project Scorpio and the Xbox One.
1186000	1189000	They can talk a little bit about Windows 10.
1189000	1193000	We know they're really trying to shift things around with this Mixer thing.
1193000	1200000	Beam has now changed into Mixer and they're going to broadcast their event on Mixer to try to get more eyes over there.
1200000	1202000	Although, I thought I heard it's going to be on Twitch as well anyway.
1202000	1203000	I think it's on YouTube also.
1203000	1206000	Yeah, so I kind of think Microsoft also kind of knows they need to be everywhere.
1206000	1210000	I think the 4K, if you want that, is over on...
1210000	1212000	Come on, let's be honest.
1212000	1218000	Forcing someone to use your platform to watch your event is not going to really sell you on that platform.
1218000	1220000	I don't know.
1220000	1232000	I don't know. Anyway, but I'm just not sure what games they're going to come out with, which could be a really good thing.
1232000	1241000	Like I said before, if any company has the potential to kind of surprise us with we're going to pull this one out of the vault or we got the game back together,
1241000	1244000	maybe this is the Battletoads year after all this fucking time.
1244000	1246000	Maybe this is the year Battletoads is coming.
1246000	1247000	That would be surprising. I'd be down with that.
1247000	1249000	That would be a pleasant surprise, I think, for a lot of people.
1249000	1250000	That would be pretty cool.
1250000	1254000	So, sure, why not? I'm going to say Battletoads, finally, this year.
1254000	1258000	Because we just don't know what fuck all else Microsoft is going to pull out, but that could be a great surprise.
1258000	1260000	Are they going to do another Gears of War thing or something?
1260000	1264000	Ooh! I know what they could do. I know what stunt they could pull.
1264000	1265000	You ready?
1265000	1266000	Minecraft 2.
1269000	1270000	Well...
1270000	1275000	Look, I know everybody's sighing, but you sigh, but it's an inevitability.
1275000	1277000	There will be a Minecraft 2.
1277000	1278000	Yes, there will be at some point.
1278000	1280000	So, why not?
1283000	1285000	I'm just saying, wait and see.
1290000	1293000	The silence is deafening with that whole thing.
1293000	1298000	I just like, it's going to be so hard for them to do that. I mean, I don't know.
1298000	1301000	I know, I know, but they got to keep that going somehow.
1301000	1304000	I mean, Minecraft doesn't really need a lot of help and they still have the Switch and all that stuff,
1304000	1310000	but I think if they kind of drop hints or maybe a first little peek at what Minecraft 2 might be,
1310000	1313000	I think there's a serious chance.
1313000	1316000	Someday, there will be a Minecraft 2.
1316000	1319000	Microsoft did not buy that franchise to do nothing with it.
1319000	1321000	Oh, they're making tons of money off of it.
1321000	1324000	Of course they're still making money, but how much do they spend, Loki?
1324000	1326000	Two billion? Was that how much they spent on it?
1326000	1332000	Okay, they're going to do more than just this Minecraft game that they're already porting everywhere.
1332000	1333000	There's going to be another Minecraft game.
1333000	1336000	That's why they're all $30. I mean, they're making two million back.
1336000	1338000	There is that too.
1338000	1345000	YYR points out, it would be tough for a Minecraft 2 to succeed. After all, it has Minecraft 1 as competition.
1345000	1349000	Tigerclass says if Minecraft 2 happens, it'll be an Xbox One and Windows 10 exclusive.
1349000	1350000	No, it won't.
1350000	1353000	At first, it'll be a timed exclusive.
1353000	1357000	That might kill it right there though, because people, I mean...
1357000	1359000	Not the Windows 10 owner.
1360000	1364000	You're going to have to show why this is so amazing.
1364000	1370000	Yeah, you are competing against your first game, so what's going to really set this apart?
1370000	1373000	That's going to be a hard thing to sell.
1373000	1376000	Sure, they're going to try it, but I don't know.
1376000	1378000	I think it's too soon.
1378000	1382000	Alright, well, believe it or not, in seven days, we're going to have some of these answers.
1382000	1385000	So we'll see. We'll see what happens.
1385000	1389000	So yeah, E3 kicks off on Saturday with EA's press event.
1389000	1392000	What do we think Bethesda's going to do?
1394000	1403000	Again, a lot of updates. I think Fallout Side Story, like a Fallout Vegas 2 or something is what it's going to be.
1403000	1405000	It's not going to be Elder Scrolls.
1405000	1408000	Or you think Fallout 4 VR?
1410000	1411000	No.
1411000	1413000	Or is that too early?
1413000	1417000	No, it's not that it's too early. I just kind of feel like Fallout 4 has lived its life.
1417000	1421000	Better yet, here's what I want to actually go back to Sony real quick. Here's what I'd like to see more of.
1421000	1423000	PlayStation VR stuff.
1423000	1425000	Sure, sure. Me too.
1425000	1429000	Now I'm seeing... I was randomly at Target the other day and there was a ton of PlayStation VRs available.
1429000	1434000	So I was like, okay, well now they're available to buy again, so I just need to be convinced why I need one.
1434000	1436000	And then maybe I'll pick one up.
1436000	1438000	I'm not convinced and I don't think I will be.
1438000	1439000	Well yeah, but you have the whole...
1439000	1442000	It's probably a good idea if you're not really into it. I mean, I even mind that I don't use it a whole ton.
1442000	1445000	And you have the whole motion thing to consider too that, you know, is an issue.
1445000	1448000	On top of that, I've never liked VR anyway, so...
1448000	1451000	Well maybe it's just you're missing that thing that makes you want it.
1451000	1458000	It's like any peripheral. The Wii would have never sold what it sold if it wasn't for Wii Sports.
1458000	1460000	It takes that game.
1460000	1463000	Do roller coasters and stuff make you sick or is it just like first person games?
1463000	1466000	I'm okay on a roller coaster in the front seat.
1466000	1472000	So I think these would be fine because especially with the VR being such a high refresh rate, you're not going to have...
1472000	1474000	Also glasses.
1474000	1476000	The glasses can fit in it just fine.
1476000	1477000	Oh yeah, they have to consider that.
1477000	1478000	It works with the glasses.
1478000	1479000	Yeah, it works with glasses.
1479000	1486000	So I mean, I think with it being such a high refresh rate and being that it's synced to your movement and everything, it might be not as bad as you think.
1486000	1493000	Or it depends on the game really because some people, they can develop games that won't make you feel very sick at all.
1493000	1496000	Some, they just suck at it and you'll probably get queasy.
1496000	1499000	Well how did you do with the Virtual Boy?
1499000	1503000	Because the technology has become 20 years since the Virtual Boy.
1503000	1508000	The Virtual Boy made me nauseous and gave me migraines.
1508000	1510000	I mean seriously, full on ice pick headaches.
1510000	1513000	Can you imagine that though? Like the Virtual Boy 20 years ago.
1513000	1515000	I mean look at what that looks like now.
1515000	1516000	That 20 year leap.
1516000	1522000	Imagine what's going to make, what kind of technology out there is going to make what we have now look as shitty as that.
1522000	1524000	I mean can you imagine that?
1524000	1526000	Holodeck. Holodeck. It's coming.
1526000	1529000	That is just ridiculous to think about.
1529000	1533000	That's the year this show ends is when the Holodeck finally comes out.
1533000	1536000	It's like, welp, we made it. There's nothing else to say.
1536000	1539000	We always say gaming's getting one step closer to the Holodeck.
1539000	1542000	Holodeck's out. I guess that's it. We're done.
1542000	1544000	Well that's been a good run.
1544000	1545000	It's been a good run.
1545000	1547000	We're playing really whatever we want to play.
1547000	1551000	Could you imagine the video cast you could do on a Holodeck though?
1551000	1552000	Oh sure.
1552000	1555000	It doesn't matter no one would be watching it because they'd be in their Holodecks.
1555000	1558000	I mean, everybody would be in their sex-a-deck.
1561000	1567000	Anyway, YYR is asking, a few people in here have PSVR right? Did you guys try Polybius?
1567000	1569000	I haven't.
1569000	1571000	I don't have PSVR sadly.
1571000	1574000	I don't need to be mind controlled for the government.
1575000	1580000	I think this has come a long way from the legend.
1580000	1583000	It looked kind of shitty, so no thanks.
1584000	1587000	Alright, so there you go. Some predictions.
1587000	1590000	We'll find out what's really happening in a week's time. At least half of it.
1590000	1592000	We'll finally have the Microsoft questions answered.
1592000	1594000	We'll get the Bethesda questions answered in the show.
1594000	1597000	But we'll still have to wait a little longer for Sony and Nintendo.
1597000	1601000	Bobby, you are confused. The Virtual Boy was VR. It was very red.
1605000	1609000	That's true. Virtual Boy didn't move with you or any of that stuff.
1609000	1612000	It actually sat on a platform.
1612000	1615000	I think that's part of what contributed to all the headaches too.
1615000	1618000	Didn't the commercials have it walking on those legs?
1618000	1619000	Probably.
1619000	1621000	Sorry, my mouth was full of almonds.
1621000	1624000	It's been years. I don't remember the commercials very well.
1624000	1626000	I'm going to look for the commercial right now.
1626000	1627000	Alright, you do that.
1627000	1631000	Anyhow, let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1631000	1633000	Obviously not the Virtual Boy.
1633000	1635000	So we'll start with Dark Sakura. How was your gaming week?
1635000	1638000	Actually, I did touch our Virtual Boy.
1638000	1640000	I moved the case that it's in.
1640000	1642000	I'm sorry, I still have almonds in my mouth.
1642000	1645000	I played well.
1645000	1650000	I played my usual stuff on my phone.
1650000	1657000	I'm not really playing a lot of stuff right now, but my schedule, thankfully, yes, is changing again.
1658000	1663000	I'm hoping that now that I have her story, I want to sit and play it.
1663000	1669000	Thank you to Raginator for the gift, even though I went and bought the bundle right after.
1669000	1677000	My goal is that by the end of the month, I will have finished Danganronpa 2.
1677000	1679000	I just need to sit down and do it.
1679000	1682000	Maybe if I stream it, y'all will watch.
1682000	1685000	Who knows? You'll watch me fail.
1686000	1689000	Sometimes you just have to kind of put it out there and see who shows up.
1689000	1691000	I have to put it out.
1691000	1692000	You know what I mean.
1692000	1693000	Whatever.
1693000	1694000	All right.
1694000	1695000	That's really it.
1695000	1696000	Moving on to Loki.
1696000	1698000	I played a little bit of Overwatch.
1698000	1699000	Very little.
1699000	1702000	It's still against AI because I'm still learning characters.
1702000	1707000	So I started playing a little bit of Roadhog, which I'm having a good time with.
1707000	1714000	I'm still trying to figure out which character is going to be the best fit for me and not quite there yet.
1714000	1721000	That's why I know a lot of people are like, don't worry about not playing against AI or whatever.
1721000	1723000	Just playing against real people.
1723000	1726000	It's like if you're not playing competitive, no one gives a shit anyways.
1726000	1727000	They all suck.
1727000	1733000	I still don't want to be a detriment to my team because I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing in there.
1733000	1735000	I can shoot people in the face and that's about it.
1735000	1739000	So I've been trying to find characters that are good at that.
1741000	1742000	But yeah.
1742000	1743000	It doesn't matter.
1743000	1746000	Medium difficulty was still pretty good against the AI.
1746000	1747000	So I don't know.
1747000	1749000	I'm just kind of messing around with it right now.
1749000	1753000	And then I played a little bit more of the Totally Epic Battle Simulator.
1753000	1758000	And that's just kind of a fun time waste when you just don't really want to do anything.
1758000	1765000	I did notice though they just updated to 1.0, which means it's finally released and not in early access anymore.
1765000	1771000	Although I think it should really still be in early access because their pathfinding AI is just shit.
1771000	1776000	I had an army of thousands of people and there was a bridge.
1776000	1779000	And they just jumped into the water and killed themselves.
1779000	1780000	All like lemmings.
1781000	1783000	Same with the other team too.
1783000	1785000	None of them figured out that there was a bridge there.
1785000	1788000	It's just, we're just going to dive into the water and die.
1788000	1790000	I'm like, this is not exciting at all.
1790000	1792000	Not epic.
1792000	1793000	One bit.
1794000	1799000	And then aside from that, I've been playing still more of the stupid Office Space Idol Clicker game.
1799000	1800000	Because they do keep mixing it up.
1800000	1802000	I mean, literally updates almost every week.
1802000	1806000	And they're giving different type of gameplay in there.
1806000	1808000	And they're making it now.
1808000	1814000	They have the, well, supposed to be this daily stuff that you do to unlock more of the in-game currency.
1814000	1816000	It's really easy shit.
1816000	1819000	The problem is their timer right now is broken.
1819000	1821000	So it resets every 24 hours.
1821000	1823000	The timer that is.
1823000	1824000	Not any of the events.
1824000	1826000	So it just keeps going and going and going.
1826000	1829000	But once that's fixed though, it is pretty nice.
1829000	1835000	Because there's really, they're making it super easy to get all the in-game currency without having to spend real money for it.
1835000	1837000	Which, I'm not going to do that anyways.
1837000	1840000	But with that and all the freebies and the different events that they have going on.
1840000	1843000	It's a very nice time sink in it.
1843000	1845000	There's a little bit of strategy to playing it as well.
1845000	1847000	So it's a little bit better than some of the other Clicker games.
1847000	1848000	I don't know.
1848000	1849000	I'm just having fun with it.
1849000	1851000	So, whatever.
1852000	1853000	And then Pokemon Go.
1853000	1855000	Just because, you know, dailies.
1856000	1858000	I hit level 31 this week.
1858000	1859000	Cool.
1859000	1860000	Yay.
1860000	1861000	Alright, that it?
1861000	1862000	That's it.
1862000	1863000	Alright, my game of the week.
1863000	1864000	We won't go.
1864000	1867000	A lot of the same stuff I've been playing.
1867000	1872000	I'm still back and I was leveling my White Mage to level 60.
1872000	1875000	That way I can have all my healers at maximum level.
1875000	1878000	Because I have White Mage Scholar and Astrologian.
1878000	1881000	All at level 60 because the expansion is less than two weeks away for the early access.
1881000	1883000	So that's exciting.
1884000	1885000	So just kind of getting prepared for that.
1885000	1887000	Because I do love Misa 5 SE 14.
1887000	1889000	So if you all think I stream that a lot now.
1889000	1891000	Wait until Stormblood launches.
1891000	1894000	Because it's going to be taken over for a little while there.
1894000	1897000	At least until I get through the main story in Stormblood.
1897000	1900000	Because I probably won't end up doing any of the end game raiding or any of that stuff.
1900000	1901000	I don't usually get into that.
1901000	1905000	So once I kind of burn through the story I'll be able to go back to all the other games I enjoy as well.
1905000	1906000	Including Overwatch.
1906000	1908000	I was playing a little bit of that as well.
1908000	1909000	Let's talk about...
1909000	1910000	Oh, Mario Kart 8.
1910000	1911000	I'm still playing.
1911000	1913000	And I plan to play that tonight after OLR as well.
1913000	1915000	Because I've been promising a multiplayer stream of that for a while.
1915000	1917000	So I'm going to play that tonight.
1917000	1919000	But I do want to talk about on the Switch.
1919000	1921000	I also finally got around to playing ARMS.
1921000	1923000	Because I wasn't able to do the demo last week.
1923000	1925000	Because I just wasn't around or whatever.
1925000	1928000	But I was able to sit down during one of the times this week.
1928000	1930000	And I did finally play ARMS.
1930000	1932000	And I've got to admit, I didn't care for it.
1932000	1934000	I did not care for it.
1934000	1937000	And for me what it boiled down to was just kind of like how it controlled.
1937000	1939000	Like it just felt like I was playing a fighting game underwater.
1939000	1942000	Like it was just like the sluggishness of the...
1942000	1946000	And I feared this was kind of going to be what it was based off the trailers.
1946000	1950000	But like the sluggishness of the way the hands kind of move through the air and all this stuff.
1950000	1951000	And I just...
1951000	1952000	I don't know.
1952000	1953000	There were things I liked about it.
1953000	1956000	I liked how the lobby rooms were set up.
1956000	1959000	How you would kind of see like you're in a room with seven other people.
1959000	1961000	And all these people were going to play against each other.
1961000	1964000	And then the people that lost are going to play against each other.
1964000	1966000	And then there's going to be a team event that happens here.
1966000	1969000	Like I kind of liked how that was being executed.
1969000	1971000	But it just didn't really care for the game itself.
1971000	1973000	Like it just wasn't that interesting to me.
1973000	1975000	Like it just...
1975000	1976000	You know.
1976000	1979000	If I was a little kid I probably would have loved it.
1979000	1983000	And honestly this game stands to do very well with younger people.
1983000	1986000	Because I think it's kind of a fighting game that's not violent.
1986000	1987000	You know at all.
1987000	1989000	That kids can really get into.
1989000	1994000	And I think the pace of the game will lend itself very well for younger folks.
1994000	1998000	So I'm not... I mean the game probably will do alright.
1998000	1999000	It's just not for me.
1999000	2000000	And that's okay.
2000000	2002000	Not every game is for me.
2002000	2007000	The most interesting part about the Switch and how Nintendo is handling it.
2007000	2009000	You look at the demographics that are buying the Switch.
2009000	2013000	The vast majority are adults.
2013000	2016000	Not kids buying the Switch.
2016000	2019000	Well Loki, kids don't exactly have $400 to drive.
2019000	2020000	I understand.
2020000	2022000	But they're not the ones that own the Switch.
2022000	2023000	Yes I get it.
2023000	2025000	They're not dropping $400 for the Switch.
2025000	2028000	But they're not the ones that the Switch is being bought for.
2028000	2032000	I mean the primary user of the Switch is an adult.
2032000	2036000	Yet all the content on it seems like it's catering towards kids.
2036000	2041000	I think you seriously need to cater towards the people that are buying the console.
2041000	2043000	Like don't get me wrong.
2043000	2045000	It's not a bad thing to have content for kids on there.
2045000	2051000	But if your content is focused at this demographic that's just not really picking up the system.
2052000	2053000	That's kind of a problem.
2053000	2057000	Okay so Chad is yelling that my mic went out while I was talking about ARMS.
2057000	2062000	So for the sake of the podcasters who would have heard a very awkward skip there.
2062000	2064000	Because I'm going to cut the silence out.
2064000	2067000	Let me try to restate what I was saying a little bit about ARMS.
2067000	2070000	So I liked the lobby system and all that.
2070000	2073000	But I did not care for just how sluggish the game felt for me.
2073000	2075000	And I think it's going to be very good for kids.
2075000	2078000	Like if they're 7 years old or whatever.
2078000	2080000	And I think it's going to be a great fighting game for kids.
2080000	2082000	But I just don't think it was a great fighting game for me.
2082000	2083000	Like for me it was just.
2083000	2084000	I don't know.
2084000	2086000	I didn't really care for the way it controlled.
2086000	2087000	And I just didn't.
2087000	2090000	I didn't like the concept.
2090000	2092000	I don't know how else to put it.
2092000	2094000	Like some things just don't work.
2094000	2095000	And that's.
2095000	2096000	It didn't work for me.
2096000	2098000	Like you know the whole like.
2098000	2101000	Oh I'm going to punch and then kind of wave my arm in the air to go where it needs to go.
2101000	2102000	And it was just weird.
2102000	2104000	So I just didn't like.
2104000	2108000	I don't know why Nintendo wants it to be an e-sport thing so bad.
2108000	2109000	I just.
2109000	2111000	You know unless it's for like a junior division or something.
2111000	2115000	I just don't see a lot of professional players really picking this game up.
2115000	2116000	So.
2116000	2117000	I don't know.
2117000	2118000	Yeah.
2118000	2122000	ActDeft in chat says I thought the controls were fine but they are kind of awkward.
2122000	2125000	YYR in chat says don't forget we're all kids.
2125000	2127000	In a way but I just.
2127000	2130000	It's different.
2130000	2132000	I would just rather play Street Fighter 4.
2132000	2133000	Like here.
2133000	2134000	I've got the actual.
2134000	2136000	This is statistics straight from Nintendo.
2136000	2137000	Usage by household.
2137000	2140000	U.S. OK so this is usage.
2140000	2141000	Two percent.
2141000	2142000	Twelve and under.
2142000	2143000	Five percent.
2143000	2144000	Thirteen to fifteen.
2144000	2145000	Seven percent.
2145000	2147000	Sixteen to eighteen.
2147000	2148000	Everything else.
2148000	2150000	Is an adult.
2150000	2151000	Beyond that.
2151000	2152000	And that's.
2152000	2153000	I mean.
2153000	2155000	I get it.
2155000	2156000	That they're.
2156000	2157000	But.
2157000	2164000	There's Nintendo proxy that I know that people like that but I think that the problem is they're not targeting that demographic and I think that is why.
2165000	2175000	The Wii U kind of faltered a bit because a lot of that market wasn't being met like it wasn't like for me I mean originally was like there's not really anything driving me to that system there's not a game that.
2176000	2184000	I really really really really really want to play on it because they're focusing on a totally a demographic that's not even really touching the system.
2184000	2189000	I mean that's a good way to try to bring in more of that demographic but it doesn't seem to be working.
2190000	2191000	Interesting.
2191000	2193000	So anyway that was my time with arms.
2193000	2200000	So I'm happy Nintendo put it out there so I didn't have to drop the money on the game to figure out that I didn't like it.
2200000	2202000	But I'll just wait on Splatoon 2.
2202000	2207000	I know I'm going to dig that so I'll pick up Splatoon 2 when it's out but I'm going to pass on arms.
2207000	2210000	Maybe if Nintendo puts it on sale later on.
2210000	2211000	Haha.
2211000	2213000	But maybe in the holidays if it drops down to 20 bucks.
2213000	2214000	Maybe.
2214000	2215000	I don't know.
2215000	2216000	It depends.
2216000	2223000	I'm not into what my friends are and what kind of lasting power it has in that regard but yeah just not just not feeling it personally.
2223000	2229000	It's not it's not going to have the lasting power of like say a one two switch but I'm sure it'll do okay.
2229000	2234000	I feel like I got an email this week that was practically like pretty please buy one two switch type of thing I'm like.
2234000	2235000	No.
2236000	2237000	I'm not going to do that.
2237000	2238000	I'm sorry.
2238000	2239000	I was not that bored.
2239000	2241000	It was a misfire.
2241000	2245000	Tiger in chat says do you think arms can be an e-sports sensation.
2245000	2246000	No.
2246000	2247000	It's too fucking slow.
2247000	2250000	Maybe with a junior division with kids.
2250000	2253000	I think it would be a great thing for kids.
2253000	2255000	But that's that's about as far as I see it going.
2255000	2256000	Why.
2256000	2258000	I would rather them play Smash Brothers.
2258000	2259000	I mean why.
2259000	2263000	Kids are already playing Smash Brothers and playing it competitively.
2263000	2265000	Why do we need to fucking put out like.
2266000	2270000	Fucking hand holding bullshit the game you know fighting it like.
2270000	2272000	Fighting game for babies the game.
2272000	2275000	I don't think arms hands holds you it's just.
2276000	2278000	It's it's a slower game.
2279000	2280000	At least that was my feeling playing it.
2282000	2283000	Slower paced game.
2283000	2284000	That's all.
2285000	2288000	I just really it felt like they're trying to shoehorn.
2289000	2292000	They're trying to shoehorn a lot of their games in the bean e-sports.
2292000	2293000	You can't just fucking.
2293000	2294000	That doesn't happen.
2294000	2296000	You can't just force the game to be e-sports.
2296000	2298000	It has to be popular.
2298000	2300000	People have to want to play competitively.
2300000	2301000	You can't just make.
2301000	2304000	And then it will blow up into like you know a whole e-sport thing.
2304000	2306000	You can't just say this is e-sports.
2306000	2308000	You will accept it as e-sports.
2308000	2309000	No it's not.
2309000	2311000	Unless you're Blizzard then you can't do that.
2311000	2313000	But you can't make fetch happen.
2313000	2314000	Exactly.
2314000	2315000	Exactly.
2315000	2316000	All right.
2316000	2320000	Some housekeeping before we get into other gaming news tonight.
2320000	2323000	Next week of course E3 in two weeks.
2323000	2326000	Orange Lounge Radio turns 15 years old.
2326000	2327000	That's right.
2327000	2330000	We'll be here on what night even is that?
2330000	2332000	June 18th if I'm not mistaken.
2332000	2336000	June 18th we'll be here to celebrate 15 years of Orange Lounge Radio.
2336000	2339000	And you might ask what big thing do we have planned?
2339000	2342000	Same old thing we usually do.
2343000	2348000	I've given up on celebrating every anniversary and every multiple of 100 episodes and all this stuff.
2348000	2352000	Maybe I'm still looking into what we can do a little special for episode 700.
2353000	2361000	But for our 15th year celebration I think it's best we just do what we've been doing and keep doing that.
2361000	2369000	Maybe have a little more time to take calls and so forth so y'all can call in and say whatever you want to say about 15 years of the show.
2369000	2374000	But for that I just don't see why we wouldn't change the formula we've had for so long.
2374000	2377000	And I don't want to make it three hours about just us.
2377000	2379000	Well now it's our Patreon.
2379000	2380000	No. No.
2380000	2382000	Yeah I just don't want to make it three hours about us.
2382000	2386000	So we'll get into news and all that stuff as well. It'll be fun.
2387000	2393000	And then in three weeks our reward for turning 15 years old is a vacation.
2393000	2400000	We won't be here on June 25th.
2400000	2402000	So enjoy that week off.
2402000	2403000	I'm out of town.
2403000	2404000	Darsaka's out of town.
2405000	2411000	Loki is not a town but it's gonna have a night off so maybe he can actually play some games or write a game or I don't know.
2411000	2413000	I'm gonna go see Guardians of the Galaxy 2.
2413000	2414000	There you go.
2414000	2416000	My kid doesn't want to watch the first one.
2416000	2418000	Is it still gonna be in theaters in three weeks?
2418000	2419000	Cheap theater maybe.
2419000	2420000	Yeah maybe cheap theater.
2420000	2424000	I will find a theater that has it or I'll go see like I'm sure there's gonna be other movies out there.
2424000	2425000	Yeah there will.
2425000	2432000	But if any listener is gonna be in the San Francisco area for Pride let me know.
2432000	2439000	Yeah I guess I could say the same thing about Chicago. I wasn't really planning any sort of meet up or whatever but we'll see what's out there.
2439000	2440000	Go to support.
2440000	2442000	Yeah just have fun.
2442000	2449000	Alright let's get into some gaming news and what's been going on around the game industry this week as we ramp up to E3. Loki.
2449000	2456000	In like I really thought that this already had happened news. The PlayStation 3 has ended production in Japan.
2456000	2466000	That's right. I guess the 500 gigabyte standard model was the only remaining model available in Japan and it's stopped shipping.
2466000	2469000	So that's quite a long time. Eleven years.
2469000	2474000	I feel like the PlayStation 2 just ended a couple years ago.
2474000	2477000	Yeah I think so too. That's totally produced.
2477000	2482000	The total shelf life I feel like was a little longer for 2 than it was for 3.
2482000	2491000	But you know again obviously a lot of stuff has just moved on to PlayStation 4. I don't think PlayStation 3 really had any new titles planned for this year.
2491000	2496000	Aside from well Persona. They got Persona 5 because that was promised on PlayStation 3.
2496000	2499000	They have actually surprisingly enough they still have stuff coming out for the PlayStation 3.
2499000	2500000	Do they really?
2500000	2502000	Yeah like in fact I want to see next week.
2502000	2503000	Sports ball games?
2503000	2504000	Kids games.
2504000	2505000	Oh okay.
2505000	2507000	Like I know the Cars 3 games coming out on PlayStation 3.
2507000	2509000	Okay but those come out on every platform.
2509000	2510000	Yeah pretty much.
2510000	2515000	So and then the Final Fantasy 14 expansion is not PlayStation 3.
2515000	2522000	They are going because that was like wasn't that the last game to come out on PlayStation 2 was a Final Fantasy 11 expansion? I feel like it was.
2522000	2523000	Yes.
2523000	2527000	So the Final Fantasy 14 expansion they they and there was this big to do about it.
2527000	2530000	They are ending PlayStation 3 support in two weeks.
2530000	2536000	If you're playing Final Fantasy 14 on PlayStation 3 you can no longer play not even like you can't even play the vanilla regular game.
2536000	2539000	It's you're you're losing access to the game completely.
2539000	2548000	However Square Enix is doing a free if you buy a PlayStation 4 they'll they'll upgrade your license so that you can play Final Fantasy 14 on PlayStation 4.
2548000	2550000	They're not going to make you re-buy that game.
2550000	2551000	So that was a nice thing for them to do.
2551000	2555000	But very interesting that they are pulling because this is something they never did with Final Fantasy 11.
2555000	2558000	That they probably could have done a long time before.
2558000	2560000	But yeah so going to be very interesting.
2560000	2564000	But that could have been one of the last PlayStation 3 titles but they are not doing it.
2564000	2566000	So that's it.
2566000	2574000	Dungeon Buster 3 in chat over at live.vognetware.com says I love my PlayStation 3 even when it sounds like a leaf blower.
2574000	2577000	Yeah I mean there's still a lot to love about PlayStation 3.
2577000	2582000	I mean it's not that it's a bad console or whatever it's just you know it's life cycle is done.
2582000	2584000	Sony is more interested in moving on to PlayStation 4.
2584000	2587000	The original model you could kill a man with it.
2587000	2591000	Yes you could.
2591000	2596000	Let's see JD in chat pointing out PS2 ended in 2012.
2596000	2598000	So I guess it was a little.
2598000	2600000	Yeah it wasn't that long ago then.
2600000	2605000	Yeah considering it was what 6 or 7 years between consoles.
2605000	2607000	It's only been 4 years since they pulled.
2607000	2614000	That's what I'm saying is that that period seems shorter than the actual weight between the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation 3 if that makes sense.
2614000	2616000	Anyway.
2616000	2622000	Let's move on and talk about some E3 things coming up including what's going to be happening with Ubisoft.
2622000	2627000	Ubisoft apparently has a new IP to reveal at E3.
2627000	2630000	They did a teaser trailer this week.
2630000	2637000	But it's of course a bunch of jokes because they redacted half the things in the trailer meaning there are surprises coming.
2637000	2639000	So yeah.
2639000	2645000	Let me guess is it going to be Just Dance 2017 or 18 whatever year that they're doing now?
2645000	2647000	Is that what it's going to be?
2647000	2650000	I think that's probably a given that there's some type of Just Dance game coming out.
2650000	2653000	But I think that's kind of not the highlight.
2653000	2658000	But what is interesting to point out I did not see an announcement that Aisha Tyler would be hosting.
2658000	2661000	So sadly it doesn't appear she's going to be doing that.
2661000	2663000	She's probably very busy though with all the stuff.
2663000	2666000	She had a movie coming out or something she was around promoting.
2666000	2669000	So yeah.
2669000	2671000	Anyway so the Ubisoft thing is coming.
2671000	2675000	We know one thing we're going to hear more about is the Mario plus Rabbid games.
2675000	2678000	Although I would have thought this was one they were going to let Nintendo reveal.
2678000	2681000	Although thanks to the leaks who knows.
2681000	2683000	But some more details about the game came out.
2683000	2687000	Some more leaks from their leaky sources within Ubisoft.
2687000	2692000	Ubisoft was apparently the one that came up with the idea and they went through the pitch process with Nintendo.
2692000	2696000	The game apparently was in the works for the Wii U at first.
2696000	2700000	But obviously the Wii U kind of ended abruptly and everything shifted over to the Switch.
2700000	2704000	So this game kind of went with that as well.
2704000	2707000	It's being made by Ubisoft Paris and Milan.
2707000	2711000	Most of it being handled in Milan such as the core creative direction.
2711000	2716000	Nintendo is overseeing it and approving ideas but they've been pretty quick to approve things.
2716000	2721000	Ubisoft is still kind of the brains behind it.
2721000	2725000	Apparently there was a Donkey Kong themed Rabbid that was one of the boss encounters at one point.
2725000	2728000	No word if that is still there or not.
2728000	2730000	So there you go.
2730000	2736000	Let's see. It says though that when this boss faints, the Princess Peach Rabbid will take a selfie with him.
2736000	2738000	After he faints.
2738000	2740000	That sounds cute I guess.
2740000	2742000	Oh my god that's so current and hilarious.
2742000	2748000	Well to be fair, D.Va has a very similar little thing in Overwatch that she does for one of her play of the game poses.
2748000	2750000	So eh, what can you do?
2750000	2754000	Anyway, there was an additional mode named Arena that was apparently in the UI.
2754000	2758000	Maybe something that would help the game kind of have an online life I suppose.
2758000	2763000	So yeah, also apparently amiibo figures being prototyped.
2763000	2766000	I know. Try to contain your shock and awe.
2766000	2770000	But these Rabbid figures will probably be out in amiibo form at some point.
2770000	2775000	The game was originally supposed to be unveiled during the January switch event.
2775000	2778000	But it got pushed back to get a little more polish.
2778000	2781000	It will be revealed at E3 and released in August or September.
2781000	2783000	That's all the latest rumors with this game.
2783000	2791000	But you know, when you've got a leak that shows you the fucking art, it's pretty hard to deny that it's happening.
2791000	2793000	Not impossible, but hard.
2793000	2796000	I mean, anyone can make a leak, we know that.
2796000	2799000	We're not gonna confirm nor deny it.
2799000	2802000	Anyone can take a leak?
2802000	2807000	This one's got a little more substance behind it than most of the pre-E3 stuff.
2807000	2809000	So it's poop?
2809000	2810000	Yes.
2810000	2812000	Moving on, DarkSagra.
2812000	2821000	Well, people have been talking a bit about the online service for the Switch from Nintendo that should launch in 2008.
2821000	2823000	The announcement...
2823000	2825000	You mean 2018?
2825000	2827000	He said 2008.
2827000	2831000	Well, it's hard to be confused when the tech is from 2008.
2831000	2833000	That's when it should have launched. I'm just kidding.
2833000	2835000	Anyway, 2018.
2835000	2843000	At any rate, they are saying that since it's gonna come out then and it will be a $20 a month charge, 1999,
2843000	2848000	they're going to leave the online competitive and cooperative multiplayer features free until then.
2848000	2850000	Just another small correction, it's 20 a year.
2850000	2852000	That's what I said annually.
2852000	2855000	You said, but your words out of your mouth said month.
2855000	2857000	It's okay, $20 a year.
2857000	2859000	Oh my god.
2859000	2861000	That's why we're here.
2861000	2863000	I should have taken you up on the coffee.
2864000	2871000	Anyway, well, they are going to have an option where you pay $3.99 a month or $7.99 for three months.
2871000	2882000	But the online service is going to have retro games to download, including Super Mario 3, Balloon Fight, Dr. Mario, some of the other items.
2882000	2887000	To play free during that time period, you will have to have a Nintendo account.
2889000	2892000	For real. An actual Nintendo account. Not a month.
2893000	2894000	In 2008.
2895000	2896000	Teen.
2897000	2900000	I was saying not a month in 2008.
2900000	2901000	I get it. I get it.
2901000	2902000	I was correct.
2902000	2904000	Yes, you were being self preferential. I get it.
2904000	2905000	Next story.
2905000	2908000	Well, no, we got to talk a little bit about this because this is a huge change, right, Loki?
2908000	2910000	There's a huge change going on here.
2910000	2918000	This whole classic game thing, certainly notable, that they're talking about that the classic game thing is an online library that you'll have access to.
2918000	2930000	So basically, it sounds, and I kind of still feel like we're reading into what they're saying, but it sounds like this is a Netflix model for the classic game library that they're going to put out there.
2930000	2935000	So it's no longer, they're no longer talking this whole one game a month or whatever.
2935000	2940000	It is, to be fair, what a lot of us have been asking for. A Netflix library for classic games.
2940000	2942000	Yeah, I've lowered those expectations quite a bit.
2942000	2943000	Okay.
2943000	2947000	I mean, I don't think it's going to be anything like that. I think it's going to be a couple games you have access to to play.
2948000	2955000	So instead of being oh so generous and giving you one game to play per month, because that's really stupid, they're giving you a few games per month to play.
2955000	2957000	And that's it. I'm hoping...
2957000	2961000	But you don't think they're going to like turn one off? Why would they turn a game off?
2961000	2966000	I don't know that. I mean, all I'm saying is I don't anticipate there being a huge library of games.
2966000	2972000	I hope there is. I mean, it'd be nice. But does this mean that there's not going to be a virtual console?
2972000	2977000	That's what I'm curious about, because now that I've heard this, I'm kind of wary on...
2977000	2986000	Well, it's not just this, but then the fact that Neo Geo games have been coming out like crazy on the Switch through the whole arcade archive thing.
2986000	2994000	So, I mean, Neo Geo was a virtual console thing before, but now there's at least 10 of those Neo Geo games available on the Switch.
2994000	3004000	So that's not falling under the virtual console banner. So I am kind of at a pause going, well, maybe virtual console is not a thing then.
3004000	3011000	This is what we're getting instead. But with this, they said there was a little something in that comment that said,
3011000	3016000	we're working on trying to get Super Nintendo games to work, but it's not going to be available right away.
3016000	3017000	So I'm paraphrasing.
3017000	3020000	Are you fucking kidding me? I'm sorry.
3020000	3023000	It's the online part. The online part is the important part.
3023000	3025000	Are you sure it's the online part?
3025000	3026000	Yes, the online part.
3026000	3032000	Because online part, I mean, they have emulators that play Super Nintendo games online that have been out since the 90s.
3032000	3041000	I mean, I just, I can't anymore. Like, you're talking about the company that made the fucking...
3041000	3049000	They designed the fucking hardware for this shit, and they can't fucking figure out how to turn a game that came out literally in the 90s
3049000	3058000	and make it play over the internet. Like, are you fucking me? Are you seriously fucking, seriously saying this,
3058000	3063000	that you can't do this shit? How fucking inept are you that you can't do this?
3063000	3070000	To be fair, it's, it's kind of still vague. I don't think we have a hard line on what exactly the games are,
3070000	3077000	how many there's going to be. I actually do kind of feel to a point, people do need to approach this with caution,
3077000	3083000	because I've seen a lot of the hot takes out there on blogs and things are like, Nintendo's going to open the vault of NES games,
3083000	3085000	and you're going to be able to play them all for 20 bucks a month.
3085000	3086000	I would love that.
3086000	3095000	No, you're not. No, you are not. You are going to be able to play a handful that Nintendo takes through a painstaking QA process,
3095000	3102000	the way that they do a virtual console games, and there will be a few a month, but I don't think they're going to, like, end date them or anything.
3102000	3106000	I think, I think when this thing opens and launches, there'll be, like, five games.
3106000	3113000	And yeah, you'll be able to play those all with your monthly, or, now I'm doing it too, your yearly subscription fee or whatever,
3113000	3117000	and then the next month there might be two more, and then the month after that, two more, kind of like Netflix,
3117000	3125000	you're going to add to it a little bit at a time, but don't expect the floodgates to be open with fucking 100 games when this thing launches.
3125000	3126000	That ain't happening.
3126000	3134000	I would say best case scenario, and this is absolute best case scenario, it's the same 30 games on the NES Classic.
3134000	3142000	Here's a weird idea. I know it's kind of crazy. Why not just, I don't know, put out that fucking library of 100 games, but hey, guess what?
3142000	3148000	Only some of them have multiplayer support right now, and as we go along, we're going to add support to more games.
3148000	3154000	Doesn't that seem fucking reasonable? Like, oh my God, like, I must be a fucking genius that can run a company like Nintendo,
3154000	3160000	because I literally came up, I literally shit out that idea right now with like no fucking forethought,
3160000	3165000	but oh, it's too fucking hard for me to put fucking networking into an old-ass game.
3165000	3171000	Fucking emulators have had this shit for years now. Their emulators are so fucking sophisticated,
3171000	3177000	you can trick your own fucking online store into thinking it's a real system so you can buy games from it.
3177000	3179000	That's ridiculous.
3179000	3181000	I think I've gone deaf in one ear.
3181000	3183000	What else is new on this show?
3184000	3191000	To be fair, there are, like, all NES games don't emulate the same. You know that.
3191000	3195000	There's different mappers that go with different NES games. Some of them are more challenging to emulate than others.
3195000	3200000	So, I get in that regard, they can't just open the floodgates, and it's, oh, every single NES game,
3200000	3206000	and plus, then you throw the whole third-party angle into it, and not every Nintendo game was made by Nintendo.
3206000	3212000	Some of the big classics are Konami, Square, Capcom, you know, they have to get them to sign on board, too.
3212000	3216000	So I would say almost the legal part probably holds shit up more than the technical part half the time.
3216000	3218000	I know, my Raspberry Pi really struggles with Contra.
3218000	3226000	But your Raspberry Pi is illegal. It's not legal. I mean, it's that whole, like, gray area sort of thing and that whole thing.
3226000	3230000	But this is the difference between what's illegal and what's legal.
3230000	3235000	So the Raspberry Pi is illegal. You can sugarcoat it however you want, but that's what it is.
3235000	3239000	The virtual console service or whatever it ends up being on the Switch is legal.
3239000	3249000	And I think half the time it's probably a legal battle that gets these games tied up, because legal shit takes a very, very, very long time.
3249000	3257000	Now, that being said, Loki, Nintendo sure did produce a lot of games on their own, especially when the NES first launched.
3257000	3261000	The entire launch library was games they made, like 15 or 20 of them.
3261000	3269000	So in that regard, I don't see a reason why Nintendo can't put a lot of their games available on the service,
3269000	3277000	but perhaps they feel there is strength in drip-feeding it a little bit instead of opening the floodgates at once.
3277000	3280000	That's surely how they've been treating their consoles' supply.
3280000	3284000	Yeah, but Loki, when they didn't do that, they got beat up over it.
3284000	3289000	That's what happened with the Wii U. The Wii U was a failure because you put all these games out at once,
3289000	3293000	and then there was nothing for an entire year, practically.
3293000	3298000	So, Loki, which way is it going to be? Is it going to be all at once, or is it going to be a drip-feed?
3298000	3300000	Because Nintendo sure can't seem to win that battle either way.
3300000	3302000	It wasn't a failure because they put out a bunch of games.
3302000	3305000	It was a failure because they didn't have third-party support for the system,
3305000	3308000	because they chose to market a system that was underpowered at the time,
3308000	3313000	and they couldn't pick up the third-party games that were running on more powerful engines that wouldn't run on that system,
3313000	3317000	despite the fact that they were saying, hey, look at this, it's more powerful than the Xbox 360.
3317000	3321000	Well, yeah, that may be true, but it's not as powerful as the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,
3321000	3325000	and it can't run fucking Battlefield or Call of Duty or all that other shit.
3325000	3330000	I mean, sure, it ran Call of Duty, but eventually they stopped making it for it or all the other stuff.
3330000	3334000	So that's what killed the system, not because they put out too many fucking virtual console games.
3334000	3339000	So, but I just don't know where this leaves virtual console.
3339000	3344000	Are we now towards this? Because here's the thing, if they do put out Mother 3,
3344000	3349000	I fully expect that that's going to be a standalone thing that's not tied to any type of virtual console banner or anything.
3349000	3353000	It's just going to be, hey, Mother 3 is out now on the Switch. It's a port.
3353000	3358000	And that's it. I kind of think this whole virtual console thing may move to this Nintendo premium thing.
3358000	3363000	So I'm now less hopeful that we're getting a virtual console at E3.
3363000	3369000	I just, I mean, really, all they have to do is just put out the content and price it right, and people would buy it.
3369000	3372000	Like, look at my fucking Steam library and PlayStation library.
3372000	3376000	It's stuff I buy on an impulse because the pricing is right.
3376000	3380000	It may not be something like, oh, that looks like fun. I might play that, you know, and then I buy it.
3380000	3385000	And same with virtual console. If they price it, like, I'd say maybe like $5 at the most.
3385000	3388000	Maybe, you know, throw some stuff out there for a dollar or two, whatever.
3388000	3398000	I'd be picking up shit that I might play. I may not necessarily play, but I certainly have a large, you know, catalog of that stuff available to me.
3398000	3407000	And that's more money to them than if I'm paying them $3 a month for this quote-unquote online service that has this stuff available.
3407000	3412000	I just think there's more money for them to be made, and they just need to do it right.
3412000	3414000	And that's the problem, is they're not.
3414000	3422000	So Act F is linking me to this article over on Forbes, which, first off, almost anybody can write for that website.
3423000	3430000	So my guard is already up going on to here, but let me see if they had actually got a quote here from this.
3430000	3438000	So, okay, speaking with Famitsu, a Nintendo rep said that the classic game selection tentative name is different from the virtual console.
3438000	3442000	Meanwhile, the timeline for virtual console sale is still undecided.
3442000	3446000	So, here's the thing, though.
3446000	3449000	Okay, so Nintendo might be saying that and all.
3450000	3457000	One, plans change, because this was not supposed to be what was going to happen for the online service, so plans change.
3457000	3462000	Online service was supposed to be out this year, and it was going to be one game a month, so plans change.
3462000	3464000	In some ways, for the better, yes.
3464000	3471000	But then the other thing with the whole virtual console is, doesn't that muddy the waters a little bit?
3471000	3475000	Okay, here's what I think it's going to be. I know what it is.
3475000	3481000	Classic game selection is going to be the really old stuff. NES, Super Nintendo, if they can get it working and all that stuff.
3481000	3488000	Virtual console, when they sell you Wii games on the Wii U, they call that virtual console.
3488000	3493000	So you know what virtual console is going to be? GameCube games. On the Switch.
3493000	3497000	That's going to be virtual console. It's going to be the newer games. It's not going to be the really old stuff.
3497000	3501000	But again, that's a prediction. That's not necessarily what will happen.
3501000	3507000	But I think I can sort of see where that division is going to come into play.
3507000	3510000	Is that it's going to be like GameCube games will be virtual console.
3510000	3520000	Which could be great, because it would give people a way to experience Metroid Prime before perhaps Retro announces a new Metroid Prime game or something in that universe.
3520000	3524000	That would be exciting. But I think that could be where the division is at.
3524000	3526000	So, we'll see.
3526000	3528000	And hey, you'd have F-Zero in your console.
3528000	3534000	If they actually do it and they put F-Zero GX on the Switch, or AX, yeah GX.
3534000	3538000	If they put F-Zero GX on the Switch, fuck yeah I'm buying it, of course I am.
3538000	3542000	And you are too, if you get a Switch at some point.
3542000	3548000	Alright. Moving on. That was plenty enough on Nintendo's online service.
3548000	3551000	So let's talk about Nintendo's online service.
3551000	3552000	Fuck.
3552000	3558000	Let's do that. Because you know, it's not that ridiculous that they're putting in an online service.
3558000	3561000	Now what is ridiculous is how they're having you do chat.
3561000	3563000	And that's just a whole bunch of fun stuff.
3563000	3569000	So this came out from a picture of a new headset that's being put out there.
3569000	3572000	That's a whole Splatoon themed.
3572000	3577000	And so it kind of gives a diagram of how this would connect up with your system.
3577000	3579000	So basically, you have your headset.
3579000	3582000	It has a splitter that's shaped like a squid.
3582000	3583000	You know, cute and everything.
3583000	3586000	One half of that goes to your Nintendo Switch.
3586000	3588000	The other half goes to your phone.
3588000	3591000	So basically you're using your phone to chat.
3591000	3595000	And you're using your Nintendo Switch for game audio.
3595000	3598000	And it's all mixing together in your headset.
3598000	3601000	And so where people have trouble with this, it's just great.
3601000	3603000	I've got all these dongles now.
3603000	3607000	Imagine if you're going playing this out somewhere.
3607000	3611000	You have to carry all this shit with you in order to do that with your headset.
3611000	3617000	To which I think, I don't know why they couldn't just integrate that shit into the system.
3617000	3619000	I don't know why it has to be a separate app.
3619000	3623000	They haven't really explained why that needs to be.
3623000	3629000	I'm holding off judgement on this whole thing until Splatoon 2 is out.
3629000	3631000	And we have more information on how this works.
3631000	3635000	But honestly, Loki, with the technology, the minute we heard it was a smartphone app.
3635000	3636000	And this is the way they're going to do it.
3636000	3638000	How would this not be?
3638000	3641000	I mean, I kind of think people are blowing this way out of proportion.
3641000	3647000	Because, A, there are certainly headsets for Xbox and Playstation.
3647000	3650000	That when they're wired are very similar types of setups.
3650000	3653000	I own a fucking headset that does this exact same thing.
3653000	3657000	Because it purposely does integrate your smartphone into the whole thing.
3657000	3661000	So that you can be playing Playstation and take calls and all this stuff.
3661000	3664000	Which, I don't know why I bought that headset, but I have it.
3664000	3667000	The way they're doing this is not completely unheard of.
3667000	3672000	How else would you get two different inputs into one headset?
3672000	3674000	Yes, there's going to be a split.
3674000	3676000	Couldn't they have a wireless solution to that though?
3676000	3678000	They could have done Bluetooth integration.
3678000	3683000	That would be the way to get around this and have the smartphone do Bluetooth over to the system.
3683000	3685000	And then the system pumps all the audio through.
3685000	3690000	But maybe they are worried about that 1% CPU loss overhead or something.
3690000	3691000	I don't know what it is.
3691000	3697000	But again, this is also the schematics of one third party app solution.
3697000	3699000	I'm not sure I'm hearing.
3699000	3701000	Chat, correct me if I'm wrong.
3701000	3707000	This is not necessarily the end all be all the way it will be done 100% of the time.
3707000	3709000	But this is all we have to go on right now.
3709000	3710000	This is all we have to go on right now.
3710000	3713000	But again, I take you back to the original question.
3713000	3718000	When you were told it was a smartphone app, how the fuck else was it going to happen through one headset?
3718000	3720000	I don't know. Plans change.
3720000	3724000	How about some common sense and realize, hey, maybe we should just integrate this shit into our console.
3724000	3726000	Like all the other game consoles out there.
3726000	3729000	It's how they should have done it because it's ridiculous.
3729000	3731000	Why is it through an app?
3731000	3732000	Why is it through an app?
3732000	3734000	Show me why that has to be done through an app.
3734000	3736000	Please explain that to me.
3736000	3737000	So, couple interesting things here.
3737000	3741000	Dark Tetsuya says, wouldn't Bluetooth have interfered with the Joy-Cons?
3741000	3744000	I thought there was some limitation on the Joy-Cons because of the Bluetooth thing.
3744000	3747000	So, that could be, to be fair.
3747000	3752000	And Act Deft also points out, one thing to know about this, Nintendo isn't making it.
3752000	3754000	It's HORI that's doing this.
3754000	3755000	So, this is not...
3755000	3758000	Yeah, but HORI has to get the specifications from someone.
3758000	3760000	They're not just coming up with this shit on their own.
3760000	3761000	So, that's fine.
3761000	3765000	I will wait until Nintendo shows me what the official solution is going to be.
3765000	3768000	But I'm having a feeling it's going to be this.
3768000	3770000	And I still don't understand why it has to be that way.
3770000	3775000	To be fair, and I think this is something else we need to hear out.
3775000	3781000	I think we're all going to the direction of Nintendo's smartphone app is going to be...
3781000	3784000	That's all it's going to do is the voice chat.
3784000	3790000	But I believe the app Nintendo plans to put out is going to be more than voice chat.
3790000	3793000	It's not just the voice chat solution.
3793000	3797000	But they've had this whole talk about scheduling play sessions.
3797000	3805000	That it might be more of a, dare I say it, social network type of app for Nintendo gamers.
3805000	3807000	Which could be very interesting.
3807000	3811000	But if Nintendo didn't do this, and Nintendo said,
3811000	3814000	you know what, we're not going to do voice chat just like we didn't do on the Wii U.
3814000	3817000	How is everybody getting voice chat on the Wii U?
3817000	3820000	Through apps.
3820000	3823000	So, is this really going to be that different in that regard?
3823000	3827000	I still want to hear Nintendo's big vision on this whole thing out.
3827000	3831000	That's all I'm saying is that the app is going to be more than voice chat.
3831000	3833000	Because they've indicated as much.
3833000	3835000	So let's hear what the big story is on this.
3835000	3838000	You have a game console that runs software.
3838000	3841000	Why can't you run an app on there for that?
3841000	3843000	Why can't you integrate this into the OS?
3843000	3847000	Why does this have to be a separate device that you do this with?
3847000	3850000	It's just mind boggling stupid.
3850000	3852000	That's not Nintendo's fault, that's your fault.
3852000	3857000	It's my fault that I told them to design a console that can't fucking handle voice chat in games?
3857000	3860000	No, it's because everybody is glued to their fucking smartphones.
3860000	3865000	And the investors said, Nintendo, you need to be doing more with smartphones.
3865000	3871000	Because everybody's on Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, Nintendo, you need a piece of that.
3871000	3876000	So if you want to blame somebody, blame all the people that said Nintendo needed to go mobile.
3876000	3879000	Because guess what, they're doing it and now you're getting mad at them.
3880000	3881000	I'm sorry.
3881000	3886000	That's like telling somebody you need to go mobile and then they're fucking retarded and make a stupid decision like this.
3886000	3888000	You know, don't get me wrong, they're making mobile games.
3888000	3890000	That's them going mobile.
3890000	3895000	Their investors didn't say, well you need the fucking shoehorn or goddamn phone in there to make it work like we want it to.
3895000	3897000	Okay, your investors are fucking retarded then.
3897000	3904000	I'm sorry, nobody that's putting money into a company is going to say, this is a great fucking idea.
3904000	3905000	Nobody.
3905000	3908000	Look at all the other hardware developers out there, all the other consoles.
3908000	3910000	Is anybody doing it that way?
3910000	3911000	No.
3911000	3912000	Why?
3912000	3914000	Because it doesn't make any fucking sense.
3914000	3921000	Because their systems are like, well maybe we should just put the fucking voice chat and shit in the console.
3921000	3928000	Because that would be easier for people instead of having to, you know, especially let's say we're going to sell this to the kids.
3928000	3931000	Okay, because Splatoon's for kids and all that stuff.
3931000	3937000	Okay, so now I've got to loan my phone to my kids so that they can voice chat over the internet and stuff like that.
3937000	3939000	Because this is the way it's got to fucking be.
3939000	3940000	And yes, I get it.
3940000	3943000	Oh, well your kids shouldn't be talking to strangers over the internet.
3943000	3947000	But that's okay because it has friend codes, you know, so you're only going to be talking to your buddy buddies and all that stuff.
3947000	3948000	It's stupid.
3948000	3950000	It is honestly stupid.
3950000	3955000	Well, let me just fire up my PlayStation app that Sony put together on the mobile device.
3955000	3961000	And let me see all these things that Sony has done on the mobile phone, yet nobody seems to be critical.
3961000	3962000	No, go ahead.
3962000	3966000	Let's hear your wonderful comeback here and I will lovely shoot it down for you.
3966000	3967000	Go right ahead. Please.
3967000	3970000	I can look at my friends list and my what's new.
3970000	3977000	Oh, I can map to another app if I want to take a look at my messages because it won't show me that in my main app.
3977000	3983000	I can apparently go on to PlayStation now, but I don't think I can actually play the games here on this app and so forth.
3983000	3985000	But where was all the hatred for this?
3985000	3989000	You know why? Because you can do that shit on the fucking console as well.
3989000	3994000	Guess what? If I didn't have that app or a phone, I'm not fucking losing features because guess what?
3994000	3999000	I can just go into the system, go up to my fucking friends list and I can send messages.
3999000	4003000	I can chat online. I can fucking play against people across the Internet.
4003000	4008000	I don't need a fucking phone and app to do that because it's integrating the goddamn system.
4008000	4013000	I got another great. I got another great word for you. Are you ready? Smart glass.
4016000	4018000	That's Microsoft's stupid shit.
4018000	4020000	And did it ever go anywhere? No.
4020000	4026000	You know why? Because all that shit's fucking integrated into the goddamn system. They just realized they needed a second screen.
4026000	4031000	It wasn't. Not the stuff that they were doing with the whole Dance Central and all this stuff that they were doing.
4031000	4032000	But anyway.
4032000	4037000	It was. That was unnecessary bullshit that they were doing with it. It was. It was just.
4038000	4042000	Let me. Let's try to bring it back to the Switch here on how unnecessary it was.
4042000	4048000	Like all the one, two Switch games that really could have been played without, you know, waggling the controllers around.
4048000	4051000	Did it really? Do we really need to have that? I mean.
4051000	4055000	They put out a lot of gimmicky shit to try to demonstrate the device.
4055000	4058000	I mean, same with Kinect. Kinect had a lot of stupid shit too.
4059000	4062000	But they realized it was a failure and they quit it.
4062000	4067000	And they didn't also use that for matchmaking, for setting up party chat.
4067000	4069000	It wasn't the exclusive way to do that.
4071000	4076000	Alright. ActDeft in chat says, I get Loki's point but at the same time I don't think Loki gets Nintendo's point either.
4077000	4079000	Well, I mean, we don't really know Nintendo's point.
4079000	4082000	We'll find out more in a little over a week.
4082000	4085000	So on that note, let's move on because we still have a long show ahead.
4085000	4087000	So I want to talk a little bit about Metroid.
4087000	4092000	Oh yes, you know, it seems like we're all anticipating that maybe Metroid could make a comeback.
4092000	4098000	But, you know, it seems like it's a long shot unfortunately. We don't know anything for sure.
4099000	4100000	But apparently.
4101000	4106000	I didn't realize this, but apparently Archie Comics, who, you know, does Archie.
4106000	4108000	But they also do other comics as well, right?
4108000	4109000	Sabrina the Teenage Witch.
4109000	4111000	Sure, Josie the Pussycats was a little Archie thing, right?
4111000	4114000	And all these other people we're seeing on Riverdale, right?
4114000	4115000	That's all the Archie universe.
4115000	4119000	That looks like a very edgy show based on the Netflix banner that they have up there.
4119000	4127000	Well, Archie also did a Mega Man comic at one point, but they pitched a Metroid comic in 2009.
4127000	4133000	So there were concepts from comic book artist Steven Butler who created some concepts in 2011.
4133000	4136000	And Butler was even paid by Archie for this.
4136000	4140000	2011, however, was right around the same time that Other M came out.
4140000	4145000	So apparently Nintendo did not jump in on this idea.
4145000	4148000	So this comic book was unfortunately never fully realized.
4148000	4152000	But you can see some of the sketches around out there floating around the internet.
4152000	4155000	I guess Steven Butler actually posted some of this on his Facebook this week.
4155000	4161000	So, bummer, because if Metroid had become part of the Archie universe, then maybe Samus could have shown up on Riverdale.
4161000	4162000	That would have been kind of awesome.
4162000	4163000	That would have been weird.
4163000	4165000	That would have been awesome.
4165000	4168000	Maybe not so much, but it's fun to imagine.
4168000	4170000	Dark Sakura.
4170000	4174000	Well, we do have something about Valve.
4174000	4180000	And I know Bobby touched on it in detail on his show, but I'm going to talk about it anyway.
4180000	4183000	Valve is getting away from Steam Greenlight.
4183000	4187000	It's kind of brought up before. What they're doing in its place is called Steam Direct.
4187000	4202000	So basically, instead of gathering support from the community to get onto Steam, all the developers have to do is pay a $100 publishing fee for the game that they can recoup after the game hits $1,000 in sales.
4202000	4210000	Basically, Greenlight has a $100 fee, but you pay it once. This is going to be per game.
4211000	4213000	And I mean, it could have been much more.
4213000	4216000	It could have been I think they had talked like up to five grand.
4216000	4227000	But now they said they were also even considering that they had it hovering around the $500 mark, but they think that it's best to keep it as low as possible.
4227000	4236000	So now for $100, people can get their game into the store.
4236000	4244000	And I think it also will just avoid... what's a good word to think about it?
4244000	4251000	It could avoid being able to put in things that may not be quite as...
4251000	4253000	Fart Simulator 2017.
4253000	4255000	Okay, that.
4256000	4267000	At the same time, $100, even if somebody that doesn't have it themselves, you know, if you're working with other people, I mean, or shoot, I mean, a Kickstarter for 100 bucks?
4267000	4269000	We need $100 to get this game on Steam.
4269000	4270000	Yeah.
4270000	4271000	Easy peasy.
4271000	4274000	Right. And I think you get the $100 back if you get like $1,000 in sales.
4274000	4275000	That's what I said.
4276000	4283000	Here's the thing. It's a tricky line because yes, I'm all for more indie developers being able to have access to this.
4283000	4291000	And you know, somebody with the next great big idea, great idea in gaming may not have the budget to be able to drop $500 or whatever to get their game on Steam.
4291000	4294000	So that's fine. I'm all for more people being able to have access to the store.
4294000	4304000	However, there's going to have to be a serious step up on Valve's part with curating what all is in the store and being able to recognize when Fart Simulator 2017 comes.
4304000	4310000	Because it's inevitable. You put this bar at $100. Anybody can sign up. Fart Simulator 2017 is coming.
4310000	4311000	It already has.
4311000	4318000	Valve, okay, then Valve needs to sandbag that shit to the bottom of the store where people aren't finding it.
4318000	4319000	Here's this.
4319000	4320000	What?
4320000	4331000	They pay their $100 per shitty game. Or per great game. The ones that are going to make the money and then get their $100 back are the good games.
4331000	4339000	In theory, I mean, unless Fart Simulator people have like a bajillion friends, I don't know. Or people go, hello Fart Simulator.
4339000	4346000	It's almost if I could just open 100 million robot accounts to upvote things or write fake tweets.
4346000	4351000	But now it's based on money. People have to purchase this content.
4351000	4357000	Oh, so in other words, okay, so they sort of do that with the ratings now. I get where you're going with that.
4357000	4363000	And they sort of do that with the ratings now. Like, they show on the ratings, like, how long have you played this? But I get where you're going with that.
4363000	4367000	Yeah, people have to actually put out the money for it instead of just saying, oh, I like this.
4367000	4375000	So now, you mean, a person can get their game out without having just the people like the concept or like the, you know, what they've seen of the game.
4375000	4383000	But the real test is going to come if the game makes money. And so if it makes money, then great. The people will get their $100 back.
4383000	4386000	If it doesn't, Steam has your $100.
4386000	4393000	I feel like the Apple, iTunes and Google Play stores are doing okay with that when it comes to the mobile world.
4393000	4403000	And of course, Fart Simulator exists on those worlds as well. Doesn't Apple have like a nominal, like you have to pay like a yearly thing to get into there?
4403000	4406000	Yeah. So they have like a nominal thing that they also have.
4406000	4409000	You have to buy a Mac to be able to upload it onto their store.
4409000	4411000	What's Google's thing?
4411000	4414000	You can get a Mac Mini for dirt cheap.
4414000	4415000	What's Google's thing?
4415000	4418000	I still have to buy one. Google's thing, you still have to pay membership as well.
4418000	4422000	Okay. So, I mean, these stores are going through similar things, but I also-
4422000	4424000	And they go through a certification process too.
4424000	4428000	I'm not as familiar with Google Play, admittedly, because I have an iPhone myself.
4428000	4434000	But I do feel like the iTunes store is really heavily curated, at least the featured stuff.
4435000	4445000	Believe me, when it comes to podcasting, it sure is, because I mean, we were a featured gaming podcast back in 2006 when they first launched it.
4445000	4456000	But I'd love to get featured there again, but I just don't see it happening because there's too many commercial people involved with podcasting to have better connections and so forth that tend to get their stuff featured.
4456000	4465000	So, anyway, I'm on a tangent of sorts, but my point is iTunes has made it work because they have heavily curated for better or for worse.
4465000	4474000	But I still feel like things like Flappy Bird, all joking aside, that game was a runaway hit and probably wasn't expected to be.
4474000	4479000	And that had nothing to do with iTunes curating it until it was already on the wave.
4479000	4486000	So, I mean, you can still have a model for success there, and I think Steam could go to something similar.
4486000	4494000	The only thing I think about the whole non-greenlight process now, granted, you know, paying $100 per game, I don't think that's going to be a barrier to entry for a lot of people.
4494000	4500000	They're not going to put up crap anyways, because they're making their money, and they're supposed to be tweaking this, but so far I'm in detail on how they're going to do that.
4500000	4506000	They make their money off of the trading cards, and the way they do that is they get a portion of every sale of those trading cards.
4506000	4512000	So they make it super easy for you to get the trading cards, and then people, you know, they put out the game for like, say, 99 cents or something like that.
4512000	4522000	People play the game, get the trading cards, sell the trading cards, make money off of it, and then in turn the publisher makes money off of it as well, and make money off the sale of the game.
4522000	4526000	And they do that ad nauseam, so that's how they make their money.
4527000	4530000	But, I don't think now that they don't...
4530000	4537000	Well, there's something Steam can do. $100 to get your game on Steam, $1,000 to get it with cards.
4537000	4549000	Well, they're still going to tweak that at some point. I'm not sure how it is going to be tweaked with the whole trading card stuff to try to curtail that, but I think right now, one of the things that I'm kind of...
4549000	4559000	I mean, I guess it's a good and a bad thing, so it's good that you don't have to get through the green light process, although it wasn't all that difficult to do that, but the stuff that's truly crap out there, though...
4559000	4567000	I mean, that's not going to have to go through the green light process, it's just going to get pooped onto the store, basically, for $100.
4567000	4573000	So, I mean, there's still going to be shit on there. It seems like almost there's less oversight regarding the whole thing.
4574000	4582000	I know that they went into details on how they were going to do that, like there's going to be ways to report if the game's broken, because there are a lot of games that are released on there that just don't work, period.
4582000	4590000	I mean, it's just not functional. So that's a big thing. At least there's a stream refund, so there's that kind of process. I don't know.
4590000	4606000	It's just going to take a whole lot of growing and more of actual people looking at it through Valve. Valve and YouTube, they want to take this whole hands-off approach with content curation.
4606000	4611000	That's just not... You can't do that. Algorithms haven't worked.
4611000	4618000	Only go so far. Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week. Loki.
4618000	4627000	So, Twitch has played something else now. This time, they're playing the stock market. That's right. So apparently, there is an Amazon engineer, Mike Roberts.
4627000	4640000	He has put $50,000 of his savings into this app that's basically a stock market ticker. So think of how they had with the whole Twitch plays Pokemon, where people would vote on different things.
4640000	4652000	So they would be, you know, buy this stock, sell this stock in this case. So after there's been a certain five-minute time, it'll go ahead and do the action of whatever's been voted highest.
4652000	4666000	And so, you know, so far he's actually made a little bit of money to it. The game will continue until his money is down below $25,000, which I guess apparently is a FINRA regulation.
4666000	4676000	So if he's below that amount, then it's basically over. But that's kind of crazy to put that amount of money on the line for people to just play Twitch.
4677000	4679000	Look at all this press coverage. It's got him.
4679000	4686000	Yeah, he's got a lot of press coverage. There's a lot of people really enthusiastic about it. And he's kind of making money right now. So, cool.
4686000	4691000	Cool. Have you checked? I have to admit, I have not checked this out whatsoever.
4691000	4699000	I haven't checked it out yet, but if you are interested to take a look at it, it's at twitch.tv slash stock stream. So go take a look and see where he's at.
4699000	4703000	In fact, I'm just kind of taking a peek right now to see how much money...
4703000	4705000	How they made money.
4705000	4709000	How much money has he made? Let's see. Well, the market's closed right now.
4709000	4711000	Right. Of course.
4711000	4721000	Most recent video. Let's see where he's at. He's up $700,000. He's $700. So $764.91. Not bad.
4721000	4723000	Not bad.
4723000	4727000	Yeah, I mean, that was up a percent, looks like.
4727000	4732000	But the stock market's also been doing well in general. Didn't they hit another record on Thursday or something like that?
4732000	4738000	And that was at the beginning. So let me try to see what did I see at the end here. $765.47. Not bad.
4738000	4740000	Alright. Good job Twitch.
4740000	4742000	Apparently this is doing pretty well.
4742000	4745000	Maybe I need to put some money up. No, just kidding. I'm not going to.
4745000	4752000	Alright. Something that you can invest in, as I'm sure is a series a lot of people invested themselves in, is Life is Strange.
4752000	4758000	Of course, this game, they practically were giving it away at some point. At least the episode one. You know, they wanted more people to play it.
4758000	4765000	I have to admit, I never got around to playing the series. It's still kind of on my list to do. But I haven't really heard a bad thing about it.
4765000	4770000	Pretty much everybody I know that's taken the time to play Life is Strange really, really enjoyed it and the story.
4770000	4777000	In fact, most of the tweets I've seen about it were things along the line of, that game fucked me up. Those sorts of things.
4777000	4785000	So I'm sure some people will be very pleased to hear that a prequel to the game Life is Strange is apparently in the works.
4785000	4792000	Alright, so we have some screenshots have popped up. A French website called GameCult found an image there at Deck9 Games' website.
4792000	4798000	And it has since disappeared. So, hmm. This could be something that we're maybe hearing more about at E3.
4798000	4807000	So, of course the leak made its way to NeoGaf. And yeah, apparently somebody over on NeoGaf said that Deck9 has actually been developing the game for some time.
4807000	4811000	It's going to be exploring the relationship between two of the characters in the game.
4811000	4817000	That might be spoilery for me to say. So, that's going to explore that a little bit in the prequel there.
4817000	4824000	So, yeah. If you didn't know, if you've never heard of Deck9, they were called Idle Minds.
4824000	4829000	And they have rebranded themselves and they're doing narrative driven titles.
4829000	4833000	So, we'll see what happens at E3 because that would be a great time to announce it.
4833000	4838000	And could also explain why you had an image floating out there on a website that you didn't really have linked to yet.
4838000	4842000	I guess this whole thing was found in an imager thing somewhere. So, that's how they did it.
4842000	4850000	Anyway, let's go back to Stranger Times in the segment that we call the Classic Game of the Week.
4850000	4856000	And every week Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,
4856000	4862000	Hey, you should check this out. Stop playing your narrative driven story games.
4862000	4869000	Back in my day, games didn't talk to you. You talked to them and screamed obscenities at them just like Loki does on this program.
4869000	4872000	A game that's taken me about 20 years to get over.
4872000	4875000	What is your Classic Game of the Week, Dark Sakura?
4875000	4877000	Fucking Time Crisis.
4877000	4880000	It is kind of narrative driven.
4880000	4881000	Is that the legal name of the game?
4881000	4883000	Yes, it's Fucking Time Crisis.
4883000	4890000	The reason I say that is I worked at an Amco arcade that had Time Crisis right across from the ticket counter.
4890000	4894000	And I had this damn intro memorized.
4894000	4899000	Your father will pay the price for destroying the imperial rule.
4899000	4901000	Whatever.
4901000	4904000	It almost pissed me off as much as Daytona.
4904000	4909000	Anyway, Time Crisis is a first person on the rails light gun shooter game.
4909000	4913000	It was put out by Namco and it was released in arcades in 1995.
4914000	4918000	Because this was a Namco arcade game, it came out in the Namco arcades first.
4918000	4921000	Along with Tekken 3 at the same time. Just saying.
4921000	4924000	Anyway, it later got ported to Playstation consoles.
4924000	4930000	Which we also had this and the gun had this pedal that you'd step on for doing the dodging.
4930000	4934000	Or if you were too cheap and didn't have a pedal like I did, you can use a controller.
4934000	4938000	Okay, wait, wait, wait. I have a very important question. Sorry, Dark Sakura. I know you're in the middle of this whole thing.
4938000	4939000	How is this important?
4939000	4941000	No, no, no, no. How did this happen?
4941000	4946000	I'm looking at our Twitter right now. How did the classic game of the week get posted 11 minutes ago?
4946000	4949000	And I'm like, how does everybody in chat know what the game is already?
4949000	4952000	Because Rama did it too soon.
4952000	4954000	Did you tell Rama to post this?
4954000	4956000	I did because he wouldn't be here listening tonight.
4956000	4958000	I didn't tell him to post it early.
4958000	4959000	Spoiler alert.
4959000	4961000	I didn't tell him to post it early.
4961000	4964000	Because I'm like, how, how can, and then like somebody even replied.
4964000	4967000	I get a notice on my phone that somebody put don't come.
4967000	4969000	And I'm like, how did they fucking know what the game is already?
4969000	4970000	Don't come.
4970000	4971000	How did they know what the game is already?
4971000	4974000	This is the biggest controversy to happen at OLR all year.
4974000	4975000	Rama and I are going to have a talk.
4975000	4977000	The classic game was ruined.
4977000	4978000	Spoiled.
4978000	4982000	It's already a bad game. Well, not really bad, but Rama and I, we're going to have a talk.
4982000	4989000	In fact, I'm about to email him in a moment after this and be like, bitch, actually, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
4991000	4993000	I have my phone right now.
4995000	4996000	And hold on.
4996000	4999000	We're going to send out these guys to Rama's house.
5000000	5001000	Starting a new message.
5001000	5002000	Going in chat.
5002000	5003000	Let's see.
5003000	5007000	Dungeon Buster in chat says time crisis announcement announced before it's time.
5008000	5010000	Black Wolf says change it to Halo.
5011000	5013000	YYR says nothing can ruin time crisis.
5014000	5016000	JD says time travel crisis.
5016000	5019000	And Orange Right says 11 minutes early crisis.
5025000	5027000	I think he just guessed.
5027000	5034000	Like, oh, surely, surely they didn't get on any topics tonight that had Loki on 20 minute tangents.
5034000	5036000	Surely that didn't happen tonight.
5036000	5039000	Now is about the right time to make a post to Tumblr.
5041000	5044000	I said, WTF, did you post classic game before I even did the segment?
5045000	5046000	I'm not, I'm acting all mad there.
5046000	5047000	I'm not mad.
5047000	5048000	I'm just kidding.
5048000	5052000	I'm not, I'm not mad at anything Nintendo and everybody's not going to notice.
5053000	5054000	I, I'm not mad either.
5054000	5055000	There's one of those things that's funny.
5055000	5056000	And I was just confused.
5056000	5060000	I was like, how does everybody fucking know this already before I even knew it?
5060000	5061000	Well, okay.
5061000	5064000	I did know early, but it's like, how did everybody know this already?
5065000	5066000	Anyhow.
5066000	5067000	Come, come on.
5067000	5068000	Your disco needs you.
5068000	5072000	And Chad says, Rama, your premature posting did not leave us impressed.
5073000	5074000	Now sashay away.
5076000	5077000	LOL.
5077000	5079000	I'm not mad, but don't do it again.
5082000	5083000	You have to put an emoji.
5083000	5084000	All right.
5084000	5085000	Look.
5085000	5086000	Okay.
5086000	5087000	Enough texting.
5087000	5088000	Tell us more about time crisis.
5088000	5089000	Texting you live.
5090000	5091000	Hi Rama.
5091000	5092000	All right.
5092000	5093000	I love you.
5093000	5101000	Anyway, time crisis, all the time crisis games revolve around threats to a particular nation.
5102000	5103000	We are going with the first one.
5103000	5111000	So basically you are part of a group called VSSC, Vital Situation Swift Elimination, a
5111000	5112000	covert organization.
5113000	5119000	And they send their highly skilled agents with bad voice acting to solve the problem.
5119000	5124000	Anyway, you have three stages with four areas in the first game.
5124000	5129000	And, um, you basically just have to go around shooting shit and, you know, not shooting
5129000	5136000	the innocent people and fighting bosses and big, you know, helicopters and a guy called
5136000	5138000	mad dog.
5139000	5144000	But this was a game that also, one of the games that gave us gun cons.
5144000	5145000	Yay.
5145000	5146000	Gun cons.
5146000	5152000	I love specialty controllers like probably more than I should.
5152000	5159000	So anyway, um, with the game, you know, you also have a time limit to be able to continue
5159000	5161000	because of course they want to make money.
5161000	5162000	You don't just get infinite time.
5162000	5167000	Um, and it also has a cover system, which is one of the first games to do that.
5167000	5173000	Um, you would tap on a pedal and you go behind cover and, um, it would protect you, but you
5173000	5174000	couldn't shoot.
5174000	5180000	You'd also, as I recall, I think you also went, um, into cover to reload your gun.
5180000	5188000	And, uh, basically, um, you'd have to clear the levels and keep going.
5188000	5190000	I mean, basically there's a freaking gun game.
5190000	5201000	Um, you, uh, you also, um, would have, um, you could get shot at, but your, the hits
5201000	5202000	wouldn't be announced.
5202000	5204000	They were called unannounced.
5204000	5212000	So that, so that people wouldn't know that they had been hit and so they would lose lives.
5212000	5215000	Um, kind of, I'd say a cheap move.
5215000	5223000	The whole point of it was to, uh, um, you know, make you spend more money to get through
5223000	5224000	the damn game.
5224000	5231000	But, um, the first game had Richard Miller as your main character.
5231000	5237000	And he also showed up again in Time Crisis Project Titan, also called the One Man Army.
5238000	5242000	Um, he was also in Namco High.
5242000	5243000	So I think that was funny.
5243000	5246000	I never played his thing in Namco High.
5246000	5252000	It just, um, anyway, you had other characters, you know, you had the president's daughter,
5252000	5257000	Rachel McPherson and Wild Dog again.
5257000	5261000	I can't help but laugh because last night I was picking the story and we're watching
5261000	5262000	the thing.
5262000	5267000	And then, um, Dan, uh, was like, Wild Dog.
5267000	5268000	And I was like, okay.
5268000	5270000	And then it came up on the screen.
5270000	5272000	I was like, yeah, Wild Dog.
5272000	5276000	So anyway, um, the, the game itself is, it's fun.
5276000	5279000	You know, it's Time Crisis.
5279000	5283000	Um, and it spawned many, many sequels.
5283000	5287000	I think up to Time Crisis 5 is what we're on now.
5287000	5296000	And there was, uh, a spinoff, um, from the first Time Crisis that was Time Crisis, uh,
5296000	5297000	Project Titan.
5297000	5304000	And it's been, it's just Time Crisis.
5304000	5306000	Fucking annoying ass game.
5306000	5312000	Now YYR is, uh, is, um, heaping lots of praise on this game.
5312000	5314000	And a lot of it has to do with the graphics.
5314000	5317000	You know, that this in the arcade anyway was a 60 frames a second.
5317000	5323000	Like it was a very, very, uh, technologically superior game for 1995.
5323000	5328000	And I think, you know, probably part of why this franchise is still going today.
5328000	5331000	And many of your local movie theaters probably have Time Crisis 4 or something.
5331000	5333000	I'm just annoyed by it.
5333000	5335000	I'm so annoyed by Time Crisis.
5335000	5337000	And I thought I was over it.
5337000	5338000	I really did.
5338000	5339000	Okay.
5339000	5343000	It's like, you know how, like, for example, people who worked in fast food,
5343000	5345000	maybe traumatized by a fryer.
5345000	5347000	Maybe.
5347000	5354000	Or maybe looking at like the potato cutting machine at, you know, in and out.
5354000	5357000	Oh my God, I can't eat fries that way ever again.
5357000	5360000	I took my, my pal who used to work at Starbucks.
5360000	5362000	I took her to Starbucks because I wanted to drink.
5362000	5365000	And she was like, I'm going to have a panic attack right here because everything's so disorganized.
5365000	5367000	I know who you're talking about.
5367000	5368000	Right?
5368000	5369000	I've seen it happen.
5370000	5375000	Um, but that's how I am about two games in particular.
5375000	5378000	This fucking bitch here.
5378000	5380000	And Daytona.
5383000	5384000	Wild Dog.
5384000	5386000	Well YYR says this is one of my favorite games of all time.
5386000	5387000	I love this game.
5387000	5390000	And SG100Matt says YYR can beat it on one credit.
5390000	5392000	That's pretty impressive.
5392000	5396000	Because considering how designed this game was to not let you beat it on one credit.
5396000	5397000	You know what games should traumatize me?
5397000	5398000	Huh?
5398000	5399000	Prop Cycle.
5399000	5400000	No, I'm kidding.
5400000	5401000	Okay.
5401000	5402000	Okay.
5402000	5404000	My, the arcade that I worked at.
5404000	5405000	There it is.
5405000	5406000	Your classic.
5406000	5407000	Give me the week.
5407000	5408000	Time Crisis.
5408000	5409000	No, no, no, no, no, no.
5409000	5410000	Do not do this to me because I need, I need.
5410000	5411000	No, no, no.
5411000	5413000	I'm letting you vent about Prop Cycle, but we've moved on to another game.
5413000	5414000	Clearly.
5414000	5420000	When you came into my arcade, it was like one of those long narrow stores in the mall.
5420000	5422000	The right side was the ticket counter.
5422000	5424000	The left side in this order.
5424000	5426000	Prop Cycle.
5426000	5428000	Time Crisis.
5428000	5430000	Daytona.
5430000	5431000	Some pinball.
5431000	5432000	The party area.
5432000	5434000	Right in the middle of it.
5434000	5435000	Tekken 3.
5435000	5436000	Right across from it.
5436000	5438000	Street Fighter Alpha 2.
5438000	5440000	I still have that layout memorized.
5440000	5441000	Oh yeah.
5441000	5443000	And the other, the crane games.
5443000	5446000	What was the other game that they rigged to run with Prop Cycle?
5446000	5447000	It was hilarious.
5447000	5448000	Addams Family.
5448000	5449000	Addams Family.
5449000	5450000	Addams Family pinball.
5450000	5451000	That's it.
5451000	5452000	How would, how would that even work?
5452000	5453000	Why not?
5453000	5455000	It basically powers the table.
5455000	5459000	That doesn't sound like very much fun.
5459000	5460000	It's a good workout though.
5460000	5463000	I don't know why someone would ruin an Addams Family with that.
5463000	5465000	That's just what baffles me.
5465000	5466000	Prop Cycle was awesome.
5466000	5467000	All right.
5467000	5470000	Uh, that's going to do it for the first half of our show.
5470000	5471000	Don't go anywhere.
5471000	5472000	There's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
5472000	5477000	We have more news for you and our buddy YYR is going to be joining us right after a quick break.
5477000	5478000	So don't go anywhere.
5478000	5479000	We'll be right back.
5483000	5492000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, June the 4th of 2017, episode
5492000	5495000	number 689 already in progress.
5495000	5500000	Myself, Rob Roberts with you in studio and of course joined by my side as always, Dark
5500000	5503000	Sakura or Jamie Summers and Tech Master Loki.
5503000	5509000	And we've been having quite the spirited discussion tonight on E3 shenanigans and what could be
5509000	5512000	coming up next week and some of the rumors coming out of Nintendo.
5512000	5517000	But for now, I want to go to our Skype line and say hello to an old friend of the show
5517000	5520000	who's sitting there on the line waiting for us.
5520000	5521000	Welcome back everybody to the program.
5521000	5523000	YYR is here.
5523000	5524000	Hello.
5524000	5526000	There's been a kidnapping.
5526000	5527000	It's Rachel, the daughter of the...
5527000	5529000	Wait, we're still talking about time crisis, right?
5529000	5530000	No, no.
5530000	5532000	Sadly, sadly, that was in the last part of the show there.
5532000	5534000	So you just missed it, buddy.
5534000	5535000	You just missed it.
5535000	5538000	But I want to talk about some of the games you make.
5538000	5541000	What's been new with you, my friend, in the game development world?
5541000	5542000	Oh, man.
5542000	5546000	Well, it's been a busy weekend.
5546000	5553000	I've been basically feverishly working on a variety of things ahead of the show because
5553000	5558000	what I want to talk about tonight is basically what I'm going to be focusing on for this
5558000	5563000	summer and this year and what I'm going to be showing at the Too Many Games convention
5563000	5567000	in Oaks, Pennsylvania coming up later this month.
5567000	5570000	Too many games, too many games.
5570000	5572000	Too many games.
5572000	5573000	Too many games.
5573000	5575000	Please tell me they've adapted that as their theme song.
5575000	5578000	No, I don't think they actually have a theme song.
5578000	5580000	Ugh, they need one.
5580000	5582000	But it's funny.
5582000	5587000	The name of the convention is actually something of a misnomer because although their arcade
5587000	5592000	section has grown considerably thanks to the efforts of many, there aren't a whole lot
5592000	5594000	of console games there anymore.
5594000	5597000	It's mostly just the arcade and the indies.
5597000	5598000	Huh.
5598000	5599000	Interesting.
5599000	5604000	And of course, you can never have Too Many Games, but that's beside the point entirely.
5604000	5605000	Correct.
5605000	5612000	But I just want to throw in before we go any further, happy pre-15, you know.
5612000	5614000	Thank you.
5614000	5615000	I appreciate that.
5615000	5620000	You know, you've helped a lot of our dreams come true over these 15 years, so this is
5620000	5624000	definitely a celebration that we share with many folks out there and you're a part of
5624000	5628000	that all here at OLR, so a happy 15 to you as well.
5628000	5636000	Oh, I'm a little past that, but actually, 2018 will mark the 10 year anniversary of
5636000	5638000	YYR Games, so there's that.
5638000	5640000	Oh wow, okay, cool.
5640000	5643000	Was Snake 360, was that your first game in 2008?
5643000	5644000	Yes.
5644000	5645000	Oh wow, okay, gosh.
5645000	5647000	That was my first modern published game, yes.
5647000	5649000	Wow, alright, alright, cool.
5649000	5654000	So you mentioned you're working on something right this moment that you're getting ready
5654000	5655000	to show at Too Many Games.
5655000	5657000	Is that something I can prod you on or is that all still a secret?
5658000	5661000	Oh no, no, I'm actually announcing it here.
5661000	5665000	I mean, basically I put the page up on the website on Friday and I just uploaded the
5665000	5667000	screenshots now.
5667000	5672000	I'm going to go ahead and stick a video link in chat.
5672000	5682000	I know that makes for great radio, but basically if you want to go ahead and take a quick look
5682000	5683000	at that.
5683000	5684000	Alright, let's do it.
5684000	5688000	Basically what, the thing that I'm releasing first, in fact this is going to be coming
5688000	5693000	out probably in the next one to two weeks, is something I call Falling Plus.
5693000	5703000	Falling was my love letter to 80s, like early to mid 80s single screen action puzzle games.
5703000	5708000	Think things like, you know, Mr. Do and Qbert, you know, that kind of thing.
5708000	5712000	Yeah, I kind of thought that, I remember when you released Falling on XNA, the 360 thing,
5712000	5717000	I kind of thought it was a little bit underappreciated, actually.
5717000	5721000	Well, to be honest, I think there are probably more people that listen to OLR than bought
5721000	5723000	the game.
5723000	5726000	Which means not many.
5726000	5731000	But I felt that the game deserved another chance, so I went and I sharpened the graphics
5731000	5735000	and I fixed a couple of bugs, one of which was pretty embarrassing.
5735000	5739000	I'll be posting a video about that in the coming days.
5739000	5744000	I fixed a couple of glitches, I added a couple of bonus modes.
5744000	5749000	Basically, you know, for those that missed it the first time, it's a game where basically
5749000	5755000	you play the part of Peppy the penguin and you're in your igloo, you're just hanging
5755000	5761000	out, and all of a sudden blocks of ice start falling from the ceiling and Wally the walrus
5761000	5763000	is breaking in too.
5763000	5769000	You have to throw or kick blocks into each other of the same color.
5769000	5774000	And you have to do this while avoiding or crushing Wally before he causes even more
5774000	5776000	trouble.
5776000	5784000	And yeah, it's a relatively simple concept and I hope more people will enjoy it the second
5784000	5785000	time around.
5785000	5791000	I'm going to be posting it on itch.io and I'm planning to release it for both PC and
5791000	5796000	Mac, which is pretty cool because I've never released anything on Mac before.
5796000	5797000	Fun.
5797000	5801000	So if you can hear some of the noises in the background, it's a very kind of ambient noise
5801000	5805000	because the YouTube we've got here is like the attract mode going on on the page.
5805000	5809000	But it's kind of like, to me it looks like, what's that old, old, old, old game?
5809000	5810000	Pingo?
5810000	5811000	Is that the name of it?
5811000	5813000	Where you had the little penguin that pushed the ice blocks together?
5813000	5814000	Okay, so it's like...
5814000	5815000	They play popcorn.
5815000	5816000	Yes, they play popcorn.
5816000	5821000	It's like that meets, I don't know, maybe like Puyo Puyo?
5821000	5822000	Kind of?
5822000	5823000	A little bit?
5823000	5824000	Like I know...
5824000	5825000	Maybe kind of a little bit, yeah.
5825000	5829000	Yeah, this might kind of pain you to hear all these comparisons and so forth.
5829000	5831000	But one of my favorite games of all time is Pingo.
5831000	5832000	So you know what?
5832000	5833000	I think it's...
5833000	5834000	Ah.
5834000	5835000	Yeah.
5835000	5837000	Well, yeah, it's...
5837000	5841000	Oh, and by the way, all those sound effects were created on a Commodore 64 if you were
5841000	5842000	wondering.
5842000	5843000	Yes.
5843000	5845000	Perfect.
5845000	5846000	So awesome.
5846000	5847000	Congrats on that.
5847000	5848000	That'll be...
5848000	5849000	I'm glad you're giving that game a second chance.
5849000	5852000	Let us know when it hits the store so we can link people.
5852000	5855000	Yeah, I'll be tweeting about it, most likely.
5855000	5861680	Oh, and MonoGame, which is the open source replacement for XNA, it made this really super
5861680	5862680	simple.
5862680	5867000	I ported it to MonoGame on Friday, and I ported it to Mac on Saturday.
5867000	5872000	Like, it was literally just a one-day thing, and most of that was installing stuff.
5872000	5874000	That's awesome.
5874000	5876000	That's a lot of stuff.
5876000	5882000	So, I'm looking forward to releasing my first game on Mac, and I believe my planned price
5882000	5884000	is $1.49.
5884000	5889000	So, even if your diet consists of ramen noodles, you might be able to afford it.
5889000	5897000	That's a great price for a clearly 80s classic infused arcade game that you can totally imagine
5897000	5899000	at an arcade back in the day.
5899000	5902000	Just not an arcade game that drove Jamie Bonkers.
5902000	5905000	This would be one of the games she might have actually played.
5905000	5907000	Well, we can only hope.
5907000	5908000	Mayhap.
5908000	5909000	Mayhap.
5909000	5910000	And it'll run on her Mac.
5910000	5911000	And it'll run on her Mac.
5911000	5912000	But no Linux version?
5912000	5916000	I mean, because I was thinking Penguin, you know.
5916000	5917000	You know, it's funny.
5917000	5921000	I figured Jamie would give me shit if I didn't have a Mac version, but I did not expect you
5921000	5923000	to give me shit for not having a Linux version.
5923000	5924000	I mean, I don't care.
5924000	5926000	I associate Penguins with Linux.
5926000	5931000	We here at OLR are obliged to give you shit, no matter how many of our dreams you make
5931000	5932000	come true.
5932000	5935000	No, I don't want to give him shit, because then that just opens in for shit, well, what
5935000	5936000	games have you released?
5936000	5939000	I wanted to run on an Atari 800.
5939000	5941000	Look, don't listen to them.
5941000	5945000	I think it's great that you're getting this out there, and hopefully people will check
5945000	5946000	it out.
5946000	5950000	Brandon, I will say this much, and if there was anyone listening who was hoping for a
5950000	5954000	Linux version, really the reason that I'm not producing one is because I have nothing
5954000	5955000	to test it on.
5955000	5956000	You know what?
5956000	5958000	I won't release something I haven't tested.
5958000	5962000	Pull the fucking Capcom card and say, you know, if this one sells well, I'll think about
5962000	5963000	doing it on Linux.
5963000	5965000	Although, let me make a suggestion.
5965000	5973000	If you do want to try an easy-to-use build of Linux, install Linux Mint on a flash drive.
5973000	5974000	Oh.
5974000	5980000	And then, because you can make, there's an application called Unet Booten that, if you
5980000	5985000	download Linux Mint, you can use that to put a bootable version of Linux on a flash drive.
5986000	5991000	I've met a couple of people who have survived hard drive failures using that before they
5991000	5993000	could afford new computers.
5993000	5994000	Interesting.
5994000	5995000	All right, good to know.
5995000	5997000	A little Linux tip from Jamie.
5997000	5999000	I took it down, thank you.
5999000	6004000	So, I have to bug you a little bit about some of your other games, because you know I'm
6004000	6007000	curious about multitasking and how that's coming along.
6007000	6009000	Well, falling plus is the appetizer, really.
6009000	6011000	Super multitasking is the main course.
6011000	6012000	Ah.
6012000	6017000	So, it will now actually be called super multitasking, because, well, you know, first you have to
6017000	6019000	do the original, then super, then ultra.
6019000	6020000	Right.
6020000	6021000	So, I mean, obviously.
6021000	6022000	Obviously.
6024000	6028000	And I'm going to go ahead and link another video in chat now.
6028000	6035000	Basically, I mean, this is not a trailer yet, but, and I hope to have a trailer soon, but
6035000	6040000	this is going to show you some of the improved graphics.
6041000	6044000	If you're going to run that live, don't do so for more than a minute, because I'm talking
6044000	6046000	at the end.
6046000	6054000	So, basically what you're getting with super multitasking over the original is vastly improved
6054000	6055000	graphics.
6055000	6061000	I sat down with Amy, and we went through every game, and she, being an artist, she looked
6061000	6064000	at it, and she said, well, okay, this sucks, and that sucks, and that sucks.
6064000	6072000	And at first I gave her a big frowny face, but then I listened to her suggestions, and
6072000	6075000	as a result, it looks a lot better.
6075000	6079000	Oh my god, I see some of the new things you put in here, too.
6079000	6081000	You have a flappy bird thing in here.
6081000	6082000	I don't remember that from before.
6082000	6084000	Oh, that's one of the new minigames.
6084000	6087000	I went from 13 to 17 minigames.
6087000	6088000	Five of those are new.
6088000	6095000	I actually cut one of the original ones, and they're in total, because some of the games
6095000	6100000	are different when they're running in different slots, there are 27 possible different games
6100000	6105000	total that you can be playing, keeping that in mind.
6105000	6111000	Again, for those of you that missed it the first time, multitasking is a game where you
6111000	6118000	have to play up to four continuously shuffling minigames at the same time using every part
6118000	6119000	of your controller.
6119000	6120000	This looks awesome.
6120000	6124000	It's so simple, but it's so complicated.
6124000	6128000	Oh my god, some of these new games you've put in there are something else.
6128000	6133000	The spike ball is evil, because you have to actually dodge in all four directions rather
6133000	6137000	than just left or right or up and down, so it's very difficult.
6137000	6142000	Wow, you have a throwback to one of your old games in here, too.
6142000	6144000	The shooting gallery game shows up in here.
6144000	6146000	You reused your assets, that's great.
6146000	6150000	Hey, I can't sue myself, so why not?
6150000	6155000	So basically, again, I know game designers hate to hear their stuff compared to other things,
6155000	6159000	but the best way I can describe it is that it's like, imagine you have four Game Boy
6159000	6162000	advances all playing WarioWare at the same time.
6162000	6165000	I have been told it's WarioWare on crack.
6165000	6168000	That is an actual line that I had from someone who played it at a convention.
6168000	6172000	But that's appropriate, and it's not, I mean, WarioWare is a freaking great game.
6172000	6175000	And to be fair, one we haven't seen from Nintendo in a while, either.
6175000	6176000	That's another game.
6176000	6179000	I should have put that on my predictions, actually.
6179000	6181000	That would be a great one to see show up again at E3.
6181000	6185000	But anyway, hopefully you beat them to it with multitasking.
6185000	6190000	Well, you know what, if they continue WarioWare, and they should,
6190000	6194000	I would hope that they would continue it in the way that they've been doing
6194000	6196000	and focus on what they do well.
6196000	6201000	But I'll run with this ball and take it a little bit further.
6201000	6204000	And speaking of taking it further, so the challenge mode,
6204000	6207000	I don't know if you guys remember the challenge mode.
6207000	6211000	So there's the standard mode where you just last as long as possible
6211000	6214000	and it progressively gets more and more difficult.
6214000	6218000	But also there's a challenge mode where you have scripted challenges
6218000	6222000	where it's the same every time, and it's specific setups that were
6222000	6224000	basically designed to infuriate you.
6224000	6226000	Yay!
6226000	6231000	That's been expanded from 30 to 42 challenges, 12 all new,
6231000	6235000	and a few subtle changes made to the existing ones.
6235000	6241000	And the last five of them I'm probably creating over the next few days,
6241000	6243000	but they're already planned.
6243000	6247000	And then, and hopefully the streamers are going to love this one,
6247000	6251000	I've added a mode called Challenge Speedrun, which is basically
6251000	6255000	it tasks you with completing the entire challenge mode in one sitting,
6255000	6258000	complete with a little count-up timer in the lower right corner,
6258000	6263000	and it does the speedrun work for you.
6263000	6268000	Interesting. I'm glad you kind of developed it with that in mind.
6268000	6273000	Yeah, and this is basically, I want to see people post times
6273000	6276000	that are just unfathomable on this.
6276000	6278000	Be careful what you wish for.
6279000	6281000	Somebody's going to figure out how to break your game,
6281000	6283000	because that's how speedrunners do it.
6283000	6285000	They're going to break the damn game to get it done.
6285000	6287000	Hey, that's good. That's good.
6287000	6289000	Please break my game so I can fix it.
6289000	6292000	Alright, so you know what question I've got to prod you with.
6292000	6296000	Do we have a release date yet, or what?
6296000	6299000	I'm planning this summer, alright?
6299000	6301000	Probably late summer.
6301000	6303000	I'm feverishly working.
6303000	6306000	My to-do list is down to one page.
6306000	6309000	Basically what I'm going to be adding in the next week or two,
6309000	6311000	because I need this ahead of the convention,
6311000	6315000	is when you lose, it's not just going to put a big old game over in your face,
6315000	6317000	but it's actually going to give you tips,
6317000	6320000	either depending on how far you got,
6320000	6322000	how to play the minigame that you failed,
6322000	6326000	or if you got further, how to better multitask the game that you failed.
6326000	6330000	I want people to understand that, yes, it's hard,
6330000	6334000	but I want to encourage them to keep trying and to do better.
6334000	6337000	Well, I look forward to playing this myself
6337000	6340000	and being able to stream this game at some point this summer.
6340000	6343000	You know what's funny? I don't remember if I brought this up before.
6343000	6350000	There was a game on Xbox indie games I played that had you do multitasking.
6350000	6352000	I don't remember what it was called.
6352000	6355000	It was where you had to play a space shooter game,
6355000	6358000	and you had to listen to your girlfriend talk to you,
6358000	6361000	and you had to repeat back what she was saying.
6361000	6363000	That was the funniest part about it.
6363000	6365000	Then you get a quiz.
6365000	6367000	Yeah, you do get a quiz.
6367000	6371000	She's talking to you, and you're trying to play the shmup,
6371000	6373000	and then you're like, okay, what did I just say?
6373000	6376000	It's like, uh...
6376000	6379000	That's pretty awesome. That's a good idea for a game. I like that.
6379000	6381000	If anyone can remember what that's called,
6381000	6383000	I feel like I need to check that out.
6383000	6385000	I don't remember. It's like some weird distraction.
6385000	6387000	Super nag.
6387000	6389000	It may have been something like that.
6389000	6391000	Ridiculous, yeah.
6391000	6396000	One more thing I'll throw in about super multitasking.
6396000	6400000	I plan to take full advantage of the Steam support.
6400000	6404000	I haven't actually done any of this yet, but I've planned it.
6404000	6407000	I want to go full bore.
6407000	6411000	Steam cloud saves, leaderboards for every possible difficulty combination
6411000	6414000	in bonus mode and the challenge speed run,
6414000	6419000	a full set of achievements that reward experimentation as well as achievement,
6419000	6423000	and a set of Steam trading cards depicting all of the different ways
6423000	6426000	that Mr. Multitasking can die.
6426000	6430000	It sounds like a lofty project, and I wish you luck, my friend.
6430000	6433000	I've been begging you to finish this game for a while,
6433000	6436000	and of course I know you have your own life to live,
6436000	6439000	and you don't make all your money off these games,
6439000	6441000	but I'm really excited for it.
6441000	6443000	It's a labor of love.
6443000	6444000	It's priced that way, too.
6444000	6447000	I'm looking at probably somewhere in the $3 to $5 range.
6447000	6449000	That's honestly a steal.
6449000	6455000	And also, because these games live and die by word of mouth,
6455000	6457000	I don't know if this is possible.
6457000	6460000	I'm going to ask Valve if I can't find anything about it,
6460000	6464000	but what I'm hoping for is that I can do this.
6464000	6468000	For the first few weeks of release, I'm planning when you buy the game,
6468000	6472000	you will get a second giftable copy of it for free,
6472000	6475000	and then you're encouraged to give that to your friends, to your enemies,
6475000	6477000	your favorite streamer, anybody.
6477000	6481000	I've seen them do those two packs before for other games,
6481000	6483000	so it's got to be possible.
6483000	6486000	You may have to price a two-pack at $5 or something
6486000	6489000	or make it super-attractable type of price.
6489000	6492000	I'd price it the same as the single and then just offer it for a limited time.
6492000	6494000	Exactly.
6494000	6497000	I think that's what they did with stuff that, again,
6497000	6499000	really encourages the multiplayer stuff, like Gauntlet or something.
6499000	6502000	There was something I bought four copies of,
6502000	6504000	and I gave it to a bunch of people I knew.
6504000	6506000	Gauntlet, maybe? They had Gauntlet.
6506000	6508000	It might have been Gauntlet or something.
6508000	6510000	I thought it was Terraria.
6510000	6512000	It was Terraria. Thank you. You're right.
6512000	6515000	It was Terraria because they were selling the four-pack super-cheap,
6515000	6517000	and I think I gave you one, I gave Shane one,
6517000	6520000	so they gave a bunch of people Terraria at one point, yeah.
6522000	6524000	And, yeah.
6524000	6526000	Well, congratulations in advance.
6526000	6528000	I'm really looking forward to seeing you super multitasking,
6528000	6531000	and I know you're going to have a bunch of fun at the conventions and so forth.
6531000	6535000	So, falling plus on itch.io is going to be first in the next few weeks, right?
6535000	6539000	Yes. Basically, I want to be able to sell that at the convention
6539000	6542000	because due to the nature of Xbox Live Indie games,
6542000	6544000	the fact that you can't generate extra keys,
6544000	6550000	basically you can't sell it outside of Xbox.com or the console itself.
6550000	6553000	Basically, for the first time, I want there to be something
6553000	6556000	that I can actually sell at the convention.
6556000	6557000	Nice.
6557000	6561000	So, that's why I would be trying to release it over the next couple of weeks,
6561000	6564000	and then super multitasking right behind.
6564000	6567000	Well, if I maybe bat my eyelashes and wink enough,
6567000	6571000	maybe you'll hook me up and I can do a stream of that after OLR,
6571000	6573000	like the Sunday before it's out or something, a little sneak peek.
6573000	6576000	You know what? If I have that capability, you definitely will have it.
6576000	6579000	Thank you. I really appreciate that. That'll be awesome.
6579000	6582000	All right. Well, YYR, I do have to get back to the rest of what we're doing on our show,
6582000	6585000	but I got asked if there's anything else you want to mention
6585000	6588000	about what's going on in your world or anything with the gaming
6588000	6591000	or what types of games you've been playing or anything?
6591000	6596000	Nah. Well, I haven't been playing much, but we found BoxBoy on 3DS recently,
6596000	6600000	and it's great if you're still on your 3DS. I definitely recommend it.
6600000	6603000	Didn't they just do the third in that series that just came out?
6603000	6609000	Yeah, and they released a demo, which is a really good sampling of the series,
6609000	6611000	so I would definitely recommend that.
6611000	6615000	On mobile, I'm also playing a game called CATS, C-A-T-S.
6615000	6619000	I think it stands for Crash Arena Turbo Stars. It's by Zeptolab.
6619000	6622000	I was like, did you really just have to tell us how to spell CATS?
6622000	6626000	Okay, I get it. It's like an acronym.
6626000	6628000	Yeah, it's an acronym, not the name.
6628000	6631000	And basically, it's BattleBots.
6631000	6634000	It's basically BattleBots, and you create your own bot,
6634000	6636000	and you put it up against other players' bots.
6636000	6639000	And the fights all happen within three seconds.
6640000	6643000	Yeah, it's a fun time waster.
6643000	6646000	Oh yes, I have seen that. I saw a little trailer of that.
6646000	6651000	It was one of the ads I had the watch or whatever in my little clicker game thing,
6651000	6653000	but it looked pretty fun.
6653000	6657000	It is pretty fun, and it's not a game that you're going to have to spend any money on.
6657000	6658000	That's good.
6658000	6662000	It's really just to speed up things that are inconsequential.
6662000	6666000	Otherwise, it's just something you'll go back to a few times a day and have a little fun with.
6666000	6668000	I definitely recommend that.
6668000	6673000	Alright, I definitely need something to replace that fucking Magikarp game,
6673000	6676000	so I'm going to check that out right now,
6676000	6679000	because anything that gets me away from fucking Magikarp,
6679000	6683000	even though I just finally, finally on my 18th generation,
6683000	6685000	caught a gold one.
6685000	6686000	Yay!
6686000	6688000	I haven't played it yet.
6688000	6691000	Stay away. You'll thank me later.
6691000	6692000	Anyway.
6692000	6695000	Yeah, I'll just mention one other thing.
6696000	6699000	I know I'm very busy, obviously,
6699000	6701000	but I would like to...
6701000	6704000	because everyone at work, everyone I talk to,
6704000	6707000	and every time I do some sort of crazy voice,
6707000	6708000	they say,
6708000	6710000	Oh, are you doing any voiceovers?
6710000	6711000	Do you do any voiceovers?
6711000	6713000	Do you do any voice acting?
6713000	6715000	People keep asking me this, and well,
6715000	6718000	I figured maybe I'll dip my toes in that pool a little bit.
6718000	6721000	So, coming soon,
6721000	6723000	cheapvoiceacting.com.
6725000	6727000	This is a venture that you're going into here
6727000	6729000	to do voice acting on the side?
6729000	6730000	Yeah, just on the side.
6730000	6734000	I'm not going to intend to replace any professional voice actor,
6734000	6736000	or, you know, whatever,
6736000	6739000	but I figure if there's an indie developer
6739000	6742000	who doesn't have, you know, a $20,000 budget,
6742000	6744000	and wants a little voice acting in their game,
6744000	6746000	they can send 50 bucks my way,
6746000	6748000	and I can send them back some speech, that kind of thing.
6748000	6750000	I feel like that's a business venture I should get in on too,
6750000	6752000	because that's something I could do on the side too,
6752000	6753000	so maybe if...
6753000	6758000	Just be careful dealing with the voice actors guild.
6758000	6759000	This would be...
6759000	6760000	It sounds like the way YYR is putting it,
6760000	6761000	it'd be for indie developers,
6761000	6763000	it's not going to be for something like EA.
6763000	6765000	I would be very forthcoming in saying,
6765000	6769000	this is not a replacement for a professional voice actor.
6769000	6771000	This is if you can't afford those things,
6771000	6773000	and just want to, you know,
6773000	6775000	get by with what I've got.
6775000	6776000	Indie focused, very different.
6776000	6778000	Exactly.
6778000	6781000	You know, I'm not going to pretend to be a professional.
6782000	6786000	Also, it's not going to be a very fast turnaround either, so...
6787000	6788000	Alright.
6788000	6791000	And if anybody happens to be in the Philadelphia area,
6791000	6794000	Too Many Games is June 23rd through 25th.
6794000	6796000	It's $50 for the whole weekend,
6796000	6800000	and if you manage to beat my challenge speedrun in an hour,
6800000	6801000	I'll give you 100 bucks.
6801000	6803000	Wow.
6803000	6806000	How else am I going to get people to test the challenge mode?
6807000	6810000	You better make sure it's a one-time only thing,
6810000	6813000	just because you might get some crazy people to figure out how to crack the code,
6813000	6815000	and then you're paying out a lot of money, so...
6815000	6817000	One try per day, that'll be the only restriction.
6817000	6818000	There you go, awesome.
6818000	6820000	Alright, YYR, best of luck to you,
6820000	6823000	and we'll let everybody know when Falling Plus comes out,
6823000	6825000	and then Super Multitasking after that.
6825000	6827000	Thanks very much for having me on,
6827000	6830000	and hey, keep doing what you're doing.
6830000	6831000	Sounds good, will do.
6831000	6833000	You do the same.
6833000	6835000	I plan to.
6835000	6836000	Take care, guys.
6836000	6837000	Take care, my friend.
6837000	6838000	Yep, buh-bye.
6838000	6840000	Alright, always good to catch up with YYR,
6840000	6844000	and the man who's made many OLR dreams come alive,
6844000	6845000	and crushed a few, too.
6845000	6846000	No, I'm just kidding.
6846000	6847000	Mostly the good stuff.
6847000	6848000	Mostly the good stuff.
6848000	6852000	Anyway, we're going to take your calls a little later on in the show,
6852000	6855000	over at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype,
6855000	6857000	but first, we've got some more news we've got to get through.
6857000	6859000	We've got to get to emails and all that good stuff,
6859000	6862000	so we're going to start with some rapid-fire news going to Loki.
6862000	6866000	Alright, so Overwatch is getting some updates soon.
6866000	6870000	They're going to be doing some balancing with McCree Reaper and Roadhog.
6870000	6877000	So with McCree, they're going to be tweaking basically his Deadeye Ultimate,
6877000	6882000	dropping the lock-on time to 0.2 seconds instead of 0.8.
6882000	6889000	Also, they're going to be increasing the damage from 20 to 80 over the first second.
6889000	6894000	For Roadhog, they're going to be reducing the size of the hitbox of his head,
6894000	6901000	and they're also going to be dropping the damage of his gun by 33%,
6901000	6904000	but his rate of fire is going to increase by 30%.
6904000	6908000	Mainly they're saying that's to stop his hook-scrap-gun combo,
6908000	6912000	which I did find that's pretty strong.
6912000	6914000	I killed a lot of things that way.
6914000	6921000	And then, of course, they're saying also that they're going to be adding the Oni Genji
6921000	6923000	and Officer D.Va legendary skins.
6923000	6928000	They were originally exclusive to the Heroes of the Storm boxes that they had,
6928000	6931000	but now those are going to be introduced to the standard loot boxes,
6931000	6935000	so you can get those if you missed out on them during that event.
6935000	6937000	Yeah.
6937000	6942000	And then, of course, they were also showing off the Horizon Lunar Collie assault map,
6942000	6946000	which is going to be a new map that's hitting test servers as well.
6946000	6950000	And then, of course, LEGO Dimensions is still going incredibly strong.
6950000	6954000	They have some new properties that are going to be coming in September.
6954000	6959000	So on September 12th, you can see new sets based off the Powerpuff Girls,
6959000	6962000	Teen Titans Go! and Beetlejuice.
6962000	6964000	Ooh, Beetlejuice.
6964000	6966000	A LEGO Beetlejuice looks pretty cool.
6966000	6968000	Don't say it again.
6968000	6969000	LEGO Beetlejuice.
6969000	6971000	Ah, no, he's summoned.
6971000	6973000	So it's pretty awesome.
6973000	6976000	So the Teen Titans Go! stuff, I'm not sure who these characters are.
6976000	6978000	I mean, it looks kind of neat.
6978000	6982000	And then, of course, the Powerpuff Girls and the Beetlejuice one is pretty cool.
6982000	6988000	They've got Beetlejuice and a sand worm, so those are pretty cool.
6988000	6990000	I kind of want that.
6990000	6992000	But, yeah, September 12th.
6992000	6997000	I kind of want to get LEGO Dimensions, but, dude, it's that fucking LEGO price point, man.
6997000	7000000	That is so expensive for those things.
7000000	7002000	Otherwise, I'd probably buy them all.
7002000	7007000	But it's LEGO pricing, and so I can't afford to buy them all.
7007000	7011000	All right, well, let's move on to talk about the E3 event.
7011000	7015000	And Sony is doing something that they've done for the past couple years,
7015000	7021000	where they are doing a big Sony broadcast around not just, of course, on Twitch
7021000	7025000	and the stuff that you can watch at home, but in theaters across the U.S. and Canada.
7025000	7029000	Apparently, over 85 theaters are being in this event.
7029000	7032000	And they've done this before, so it's not like it's new.
7032000	7036000	But when they've done it before, they sometimes have some little Sony trinkets
7036000	7038000	that they give away in giveaway bags and all that,
7038000	7040000	and you get to see these trailers on the big screen,
7040000	7042000	which is really worth it for a lot of people as well.
7042000	7046000	So the PlayStation E3 experience is returning for 2017.
7046000	7050000	I do know the tickets already went up, I think on May 30th.
7050000	7055000	They went through a new vendor called GoFobo, which I'd never heard of before.
7055000	7057000	And apparently, it didn't go well.
7057000	7062000	I heard a lot of talk on Twitter about it's not so great.
7062000	7066000	I didn't try for it, because I think the timing doesn't work out,
7066000	7068000	because I still have to work on Monday.
7068000	7072000	And in years past, the closest place to San Francisco anyway, I can't get to it.
7072000	7075000	Yeah, it was like Pleasanton or something like that.
7075000	7078000	That's fine. I'll watch it on my TV at Omis. I always have.
7078000	7080000	But for those that want the theater experience,
7080000	7084000	sometimes feeding off that crowd energy kind of gets people even more amped up.
7084000	7086000	So cool.
7086000	7090000	I know where it'd be really cool to feed off that crowd energy and watch it.
7090000	7093000	Is PlayStation home?
7093000	7096000	Maybe that'll come back in VR. You never know.
7096000	7098000	That would be cool. I'd be down.
7098000	7100000	Well, one of the things I think that got spoiled ahead of E3
7100000	7106000	is the full Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite roster.
7106000	7109000	Again, of course, they've done a reveal trailer so far,
7109000	7115000	but some of the fighters in this game have already been leaked out there.
7115000	7119000	Apparently there are 27 of them. I'm not going to read the entire list here,
7119000	7122000	because, again, we don't know anything until really Capcom confirms it.
7122000	7127000	But it does sound like the X-Men are out, as we probably anticipated,
7127000	7132000	and some of the more deep cuts with Capcom are apparently out as well.
7132000	7137000	For example, the beautiful Joe is not there.
7137000	7140000	Phoenix Wright is not there, but Monster Hunter is.
7141000	7145000	With a lot of those things, what they're trying to do with this is
7145000	7147000	they're going to go the multi-season route with it,
7147000	7152000	so they're going to put out certain characters for DLC now,
7152000	7157000	and then they're going to do a second season where they may add some more of these other characters.
7157000	7160000	I kind of wish they were all available from the get-go,
7160000	7164000	but I understand that they want to do balancing stuff.
7164000	7168000	It all seems like a lot of it's just the Marvel Cinematic stuff
7168000	7170000	based on the characters that they have available.
7170000	7173000	Yeah. So, there it is.
7173000	7176000	The whole Marvel vs. Capcom list is floating around out there.
7176000	7178000	I'm sure some of you guys have already seen it again.
7178000	7183000	I'm not going to read the whole thing, but it's a very fair sampling of
7183000	7187000	what's been going on in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as of late as well.
7187000	7189000	In fact, for better or for worse.
7189000	7192000	But some people really not happy about the lack of X-Men characters,
7192000	7196000	but I kind of thought that was already going to be a given about this game.
7196000	7198000	We kind of knew that going into this.
7198000	7199000	Yeah, I kind of figured it would be.
7199000	7201000	So, I'm not sure why suddenly people are surprised.
7201000	7203000	Maybe they were hoping for a last-minute thing.
7203000	7204000	Hoping for Deadpool again.
7204000	7206000	Yeah, maybe.
7206000	7208000	All right, moving on. Dark Sakura.
7208000	7214000	Well, in other news, we have Dickinson Setsu some news.
7214000	7218000	Basically, there's something been teased that's new for the series.
7219000	7225000	It was said by Masaru Oyamada, who had a few things to say about it
7225000	7228000	in his interview with Famitsu.
7228000	7234000	Especially that they'd like to make sure that the old Snake and Densetsu games
7234000	7237000	can be appreciated by younger players.
7237000	7243000	And looking at graphic uprising from what I can see on here.
7244000	7249000	And he wants to take the opportunity to announce a new development
7249000	7253000	around the 25th anniversary of the series.
7253000	7256000	So, who knows? We maybe see something else.
7256000	7262000	Also, Legendary Pokemon and PvP are coming to Pokemon GO this summer.
7262000	7268000	So, basically, you can finally have your on-the-spot dueling
7268000	7274000	and Legendary so that you don't have to crash actual Pokemon Center events.
7274000	7279000	You can just follow the news from Niantic and that's it.
7279000	7281000	You just crash their servers instead.
7281000	7282000	Right.
7282000	7283000	All the people playing.
7283000	7285000	Who needs servers anyway? Just crash them all.
7285000	7288000	I'm curious to see how they're going to do that.
7288000	7291000	Because one of the things I know they quoted on there is
7291000	7295000	they've learned a lot about the social interaction stuff with Ingress.
7295000	7298000	And I'm curious to see how they're going to integrate that with Pokemon.
7298000	7301000	Because, to be honest, right now there is no game.
7301000	7302000	It's collecting for me.
7302000	7304000	No competitive game.
7304000	7307000	Yeah, I really want to see what happens with the whole gym.
7307000	7310000	You see, with these gyms, you're going to make these links from one gym to the next.
7310000	7313000	No, no, no, no.
7313000	7315000	But even when it comes to Ingress, I'm like,
7315000	7318000	yeah, the community stuff is still cool.
7318000	7320000	And it's nice that they're bringing back some of the live events.
7320000	7322000	And I can probably get into some of those.
7322000	7326000	But the day-to-day stuff is kind of just over it.
7326000	7334000	It'll be nice when there's a 2.0 to shake things up and make things feel fresh again.
7334000	7337000	And I think I can say the same thing about Pokemon is that
7337000	7342000	when you re-up the gym game and have more of a point to the collecting and all that stuff,
7342000	7344000	there will be that.
7344000	7346000	So, anyway.
7346000	7348000	Alright, let's move on.
7348000	7349000	Let's move on.
7349000	7354000	We're going to travel around the world and check out what is in stores this week as far as releases go.
7354000	7356000	Loki, how about the US?
7356000	7358000	Yes, we do have a few things coming out this week.
7358000	7360000	So, starting off with Cloudone Returns.
7360000	7362000	This is Sengoku.
7362000	7365000	That's going to be on PC, PlayStation 4, and the Vita.
7365000	7368000	We have Dark Rose Valkyrie on PlayStation 4.
7368000	7372000	Dirt 4 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
7372000	7376000	Farming Simulator 18 on 3DS and the Vita.
7376000	7379000	Farting Simulator. No.
7379000	7381000	No, not Farting Simulator.
7381000	7384000	Farting Simulator 18, I'm sure, is already on Steam.
7384000	7386000	I'm pretty sure that's already a thing.
7386000	7388000	Guardians of the Galaxy, the Telltale series.
7388000	7397000	Episode 2, Under Pressure, is going to be coming out this week on PC, Mac, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, iOS, and Android.
7397000	7398000	This is pretty interesting.
7398000	7401000	Wipeout Omega Collection on PlayStation 4.
7401000	7407000	And finally, Super Beat Zonic on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7407000	7410000	If you add a Z, it makes it edgier.
7410000	7413000	It's not a Z. It's an X, actually.
7413000	7416000	Oh, that makes it any edgier.
7416000	7424000	All right, we're going to travel over to Japan and check out what's coming out for those release dates on the...
7424000	7426000	What is the big day for releases there?
7426000	7429000	I think the 9th is the next big release day.
7429000	7433000	Although I'm not really seeing anything in Japan on the 9th.
7433000	7437000	Do we not have anything big coming out on the PlayStation 4 in Japan?
7437000	7439000	Maybe not. At least not on the PS4 this week.
7439000	7444000	Yeah, the next big thing I see is Stormblood for Final Fantasy XIV on the 20th.
7444000	7447000	But I'm not really seeing anything in Japan at least earlier in the month.
7447000	7450000	Let me see if there's something on Nintendo that might be the reason why.
7450000	7457000	No, the Alliance Alive is out on June the 22nd in Japan on the 3DS.
7457000	7461000	And on the Switch, Arms is out on June 16th.
7461000	7465000	But it doesn't look like we have anything out a little earlier here.
7465000	7467000	I'm not sure if there's any...
7467000	7469000	Oh, I tell you what. We have a Vita game.
7469000	7471000	We have a lone Vita game on June the 8th.
7471000	7476000	Shiro to Kuro no Alice is out in regular and limited edition.
7476000	7477000	A lone game.
7477000	7479000	The game system that Sony has forgotten about.
7479000	7480000	Not there.
7480000	7482000	Only one that's getting games.
7482000	7483000	Not there.
7483000	7485000	It's much different in Japan than it is here.
7485000	7489000	You take your Xbox One racks here and replace them with the Vita.
7489000	7492000	That's basically what Japan is a little more like.
7492000	7495000	I don't know if there's a cultural reason.
7495000	7498000	When's the school year there?
7498000	7499000	Year round?
7499000	7500000	It's year round.
7500000	7502000	So it's not even like a finals thing or anything.
7502000	7506000	There's like a summer break but school pretty much is year round.
7506000	7507000	Interesting.
7507000	7509000	Maybe because of E3. I don't know.
7509000	7511000	Anyway, how about the UK?
7512000	7515000	On the 7th we have Wipeout Omega Collection for PS4.
7515000	7521000	And then on the 8th, Dirt 4 for PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One.
7521000	7523000	That's it.
7523000	7527000	Alright. Let's head on over to the mailbag.
7527000	7531000	Wait. There's a game coming out in the next week but I think the name is funny.
7531000	7532000	What?
7532000	7534000	It's Pixel Heroes Bite and Magic.
7534000	7536000	As in Might and Magic.
7536000	7537000	That's cute.
7537000	7540000	Alright. Let's go to the mailbag.
7540000	7542000	Every week you guys email us.
7542000	7547000	Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com and you can participate with the show.
7553000	7557000	Alright. This email comes from Tiger Tooth.
7557000	7563000	Hello. Actually we have two emails from him but I will read them both because one of them is super short.
7564000	7567000	Hello OLR. I'm a long time listener. First time emailer.
7567000	7569000	Yay! Level up.
7569000	7573000	I believe I first started listening to your show when I was in 8th grade.
7573000	7576000	And I'm now about to graduate from high school.
7576000	7578000	And now I'm retiring.
7578000	7579000	I feel old.
7579000	7587000	During my first week of high school my history teacher had us make time capsule letters so that we wouldn't get back until the end of our senior year.
7587000	7594000	The time capsule letters were a series of questions that we could write honest responses to because no one but ourselves were supposed to see them.
7594000	7598000	Well with final exams and graduation around the corner he gave them back to us.
7598000	7603000	And reading through it astonished how bad my spelling was laughing at the jokes I threw in it.
7603000	7605000	When suddenly I see an OLR reference.
7605000	7609000	The question was I dislike blank because blank.
7609000	7614000	And my obscure ass put I dislike Britney Spears because I think she is a skank.
7615000	7617000	And ORL is what it said.
7617000	7624000	I chuckled to myself after reading this and suddenly found myself at a loss for where this came from.
7624000	7627000	Obviously it's an OLR reference but who and why said it?
7627000	7632000	I feel like it was Dark Sakura but I could totally see Rob saying this too.
7632000	7634000	Okay okay okay okay.
7634000	7639000	This show is so old I don't remember things that happened on this show three weeks ago.
7639000	7650000	If I didn't have Dark Tetsuya and some of the other long time OLR listeners like Misty and folks and the Wiki and all that I wouldn't know what happened on this show a year ago and so forth.
7650000	7654000	So I think that's hilarious that you wrote a note that kind of came back.
7654000	7662000	One thing I do recall though is let's not forget Britney Spears went through her whole little meltdown phase around that time before Blackout came out.
7662000	7665000	And I think there were probably a lot of people saying that sort of thing about her.
7665000	7672000	But you know what? My opinion on her will say has evolved a lot because she's an awesome ally. Did you see that letter that she wrote?
7672000	7677000	She hand wrote for her LGBT fans on June 1st to get off Pride Month and I thought that was awesome.
7677000	7681000	And so like you know all Britney wants to do is raise her kids.
7681000	7685000	And she can afford wigs and weave.
7685000	7688000	I do seem to recall we had a conversation like this before.
7688000	7691000	I don't even know if it was on this show or another show but I want to say you said something like
7692000	7697000	All Britney Spears wants to do is live in a trailer in the back part of Alabama or wherever she's from.
7697000	7698000	Louisiana.
7698000	7700000	Louisiana and raise her kids.
7700000	7703000	Like she didn't want all this celebrity stuff it just kind of happened to her.
7703000	7713000	And I kind of I tend to agree with that that she does all this stuff and does the lip syncs on stage to music that's really really produced and all this stuff because she wants to make a good life for her kids.
7713000	7717000	So you know what? I got no reason to hate on Britney Spears anymore.
7717000	7720000	And I'm sorry if I ever said anything to hurt her feelings.
7721000	7723000	Besides that Derek Barry can do it for her.
7723000	7727000	I don't think Loki would have an opinion on the matter but who knows.
7727000	7731000	Also how did the subject come up lol.
7731000	7738000	Anyways thought you would like to know that you made it into a capsule letter from some random kid on the other side of the country.
7738000	7743000	That I do get a kick out of even if I have no idea what the heck this is all about.
7743000	7747000	I do love that story so thank you for sharing that.
7747000	7749000	That's right we have our time capsule too.
7749000	7755000	We do we do have our time capsule it's waiting for December to come around the holiday episode.
7755000	7757000	Alright awesome.
7759000	7763000	Well also did I say I live in Western New York by the way.
7763000	7765000	Sincerely Tigertooth.
7765000	7769000	PS sorry if there is any grammar errors.
7769000	7773000	PPS I took a selfie on a teacup when I went to Disney World a month ago.
7773000	7775000	Bring back Horde House.
7775000	7777000	Hashtag movement Horde House.
7777000	7780000	I listened to that show from episode 80 until the bitter end.
7780000	7783000	I still think of Pepper Time and Mint and Rob's laugh.
7783000	7785000	Whenever I listen to the Spice Girls.
7785000	7787000	That was a great in-joke from Horde House.
7787000	7793000	Sadly it's just one of those things where I think we've all moved on just creatively and we're not really playing MMOs anymore.
7793000	7796000	I know you want it you want the show you can take over Dark Saga.
7796000	7797000	Okay.
7797000	7800000	When I say we all of course I mean myself, Extover, Shane, and Grandpa.
7800000	7805000	But the cool thing is just about everybody from those days is still podcasting.
7805000	7808000	You can hear Grandpa as Captain Matt on Starboard Power Coupling.
7808000	7810000	Which is here on VOG.
7810000	7815000	Shane does Ranger Pride which is here on VOG with Captain Spike.
7815000	7819000	And Extover and I we were doing Guys on a Show.
7819000	7823000	I do not consider that like Pokestop podcast is done.
7823000	7825000	Like that that show is not coming back.
7825000	7829000	Guys on a Show is still for me on a hiatus and will be back.
7829000	7835000	Just that Extover hasn't really been able to commit to a regular recording schedule.
7835000	7837000	That gels with mine. I won't put all the blame on him.
7837000	7839000	That gels with my schedule as well.
7839000	7842000	So we just haven't really been able to bring that back.
7842000	7847000	But we do have ideas and like creatively we kind of know what we want to do with that.
7847000	7851000	So I do still strongly feel Guys on a Show will come back at some point.
7851000	7853000	And that's pretty much everybody from the Horde House days.
7853000	7858000	But as far as that I mean we all stopped playing Warcraft except for Grandpa.
7858000	7860000	I think still dabbles in it.
7860000	7861000	I've seen him on sometimes.
7861000	7862000	Yeah but.
7862000	7865000	But I'm pretty much there by myself in good old Danger Squad.
7865000	7870000	Oh even Captain Spike and Slidekick stopped playing over there?
7870000	7871000	I don't really see them that much.
7871000	7872000	That's too bad.
7872000	7873000	But you know.
7873000	7877000	It just kind of it is what it is.
7877000	7878000	You know it didn't.
7878000	7884000	The show never really recovered from the shift away from Warcraft because it just got too broad.
7884000	7887000	So we just weren't able to make it work anymore.
7887000	7888000	So.
7888000	7891000	But I have some good memories and they're all still my friends.
7891000	7892000	So you never know what might happen.
7892000	7895000	There might be a reunion around another topic someday.
7895000	7899000	There's another addendum in the form of another email.
7899000	7900000	Keep up the awesome work.
7900000	7904000	You guys never fail to entertain me when I'm doing mundane chores.
7904000	7906000	Are you doing laundry right now?
7906000	7913000	You guys help get my mind off things during stressful times and you guys are way better than wild background music.
7913000	7914000	LOL.
7914000	7915000	Sincerely Tiger Tooth.
7915000	7918000	And don't forget to separate your whites and your colors.
7918000	7921000	Unless you just wash all that shit on cold like I do.
7921000	7924000	But the whites will be whiter if you wash them separately.
7924000	7925000	You know what?
7925000	7928000	Whites already too damn white.
7928000	7930000	I had to go there.
7930000	7932000	All right.
7932000	7933000	Ah.
7933000	7934000	Thank you.
7934000	7935000	Thank you for the emails.
7935000	7940000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you wish to send us an email for the future.
7940000	7945000	In the meantime, we have more news to get into starting with Loki.
7945000	7946000	Yes.
7946000	7951000	So this is kind of unexpected but apparently the Kerbal Space Program.
7951000	7957000	They announced that I guess the game has been acquired by Take Two Interactive.
7957000	7958000	So they're not.
7958000	7960000	They're saying that it's not really going to change much.
7961000	7968000	That the squad and the current development team is still here and hard to work on KSP and its future updates.
7968000	7973000	But we are now fortunate enough to do so with the help of an experienced publisher like Take Two.
7973000	7982000	And we couldn't be more excited and happy to see our conjoint collaboration or see where our conjoint collaboration will take KSP forward.
7982000	7985000	So that's pretty awesome.
7985000	7988000	And yeah it is kind of interesting to see how that works out.
7988000	7993000	Yeah. I don't know. Maybe that means a sequel.
7993000	7995000	Who knows.
7995000	7997000	I have this installed on my computer.
7997000	8000000	I have honestly played it for about five minutes and that's been kind of it.
8000000	8002000	But maybe I need to go back.
8002000	8003000	It didn't hold your interest at all.
8003000	8005000	I just. I don't know.
8005000	8011000	I didn't really get too experimental with making ships and stuff.
8011000	8014000	But there's a lot of people that have made pretty crazy things with it.
8014000	8016000	It might be something worth checking out.
8016000	8020000	I know I think while I was prepping the show my son saw this and he's like what's that.
8020000	8022000	And I'm like I had to explain to him what it was.
8022000	8028000	And he seemed interested. So maybe it might be something that I can think about playing later on.
8028000	8032000	One of my buddies was really into this game and the physics of it were very interesting.
8032000	8036000	I didn't realize that they released it on console but apparently it says it's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
8036000	8038000	Yeah they put it on PS4 at some point.
8038000	8040000	I apologize because I had to step out for just a minute.
8040000	8045000	But with this whole Kerbal Space Program and the Take Two stuff is it like are we gearing up for a sequel.
8045000	8047000	Are we gearing up for a sequel at E3. Like is this putting all the.
8047000	8049000	I don't know.
8049000	8053000	You would think an acquisition like that is setting things up for a sequel.
8053000	8054000	I don't know.
8054000	8056000	You would think. I don't know what they're going to do with it.
8056000	8057000	But it's neat.
8057000	8061000	Well now I hope this is something that's leading into E3.
8061000	8063000	And it's Bayonetta 3.
8063000	8066000	Yes that's right I really want Bayonetta 3 to happen.
8066000	8072000	And you know there was an interview that Source Gaming did with Atsushi Inaba from Platinum Games.
8072000	8077000	And of course they asked you know they're trying to kind of like you know not say confirm Bayonetta 3.
8077000	8084000	But they said if Bayonetta 3 were to ever happen would Bayonetta still be the protagonist or would you try to surprise fans.
8084000	8088000	And the answer was maybe there would be a male Bayonetta.
8088000	8090000	Male-netta.
8090000	8092000	Why not.
8092000	8094000	It should be called Bayonet.
8094000	8096000	Why not. I think that would be hilarious.
8096000	8101000	And says I would like to make Bayonetta 3. We're talking within the company even now about what to do.
8101000	8105000	But because we're constantly talking about it that actually makes it really hard to say.
8105000	8111000	If we weren't talking about it we could just say something random or offhand you know but because we're actually talking about it.
8111000	8114000	Of course that's just something that you talk about when you're making a series.
8114000	8116000	Do you want to keep the same protagonist.
8116000	8120000	There's plenty of precedent for changing protagonists and so that is something we discuss.
8120000	8123000	Do we want to keep the same one have a different one add new ones.
8123000	8125000	But that's certainly not anything I can say for sure at this point.
8125000	8129000	Well that was kind of the run around there at the end there.
8129000	8131000	But I love this. I love folks in our chat room here.
8131000	8137000	Dungeon Buster says boy-netta and Tiger Claw says bro-netta.
8137000	8139000	So there's some answers there. Why not. Why not.
8139000	8144000	Whatever they want to do creatively as long as it's as fun as the first two games.
8144000	8146000	I would be so about that.
8146000	8149000	So I do hope a Bayonetta 3 is in the works.
8149000	8157000	I hope the quiet reception to Bayonetta 2 on the Wii U just because the Wii U was the Wii U doesn't ruin our chances.
8158000	8161000	We'll see though in about a little over a week.
8163000	8169000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com use the pass phrase liquid.
8169000	8171000	In the meantime, DarkSakura.
8171000	8176000	Well just leave it to the ratings board to spoil shit for us again.
8176000	8183000	There is a leak from the ratings board that talks about Minecraft story mode season 2.
8184000	8187000	Well okay technically this was in Australia but hey.
8187000	8190000	It's called Hero in Residence.
8190000	8199000	It was labeled as multi-platform which would match the 11 different device releases that we got with the previous one.
8199000	8202000	Including the upcoming Switch release.
8202000	8205000	So yeah.
8205000	8209000	Well it's not quite Minecraft 2 like you were saying at the beginning but hey.
8209000	8213000	It is a Minecraft part 2 but it's a little different.
8213000	8215000	It's it's own thing I guess.
8215000	8217000	Story mode is a Telltale game.
8217000	8219000	It's just in the Minecraft universe.
8219000	8221000	It was alright. I played the first episode and it was okay.
8221000	8224000	I mean it was my first Telltale game which is awesome.
8224000	8225000	Was it really?
8225000	8227000	Well I have, I own a lot of them.
8227000	8229000	I just haven't played a lot of them.
8229000	8231000	Make time to play Walking Dead.
8231000	8233000	It's good.
8233000	8238000	I still want to go through Sam and Max and the Back to the Future series.
8238000	8241000	I even like the Jurassic Park ones.
8241000	8244000	I know a lot of people hated on those but I thought that was fun.
8244000	8246000	So whatever.
8246000	8248000	Of course I don't know.
8248000	8251000	The Telltale stuff is kind of a throwback to me of the older PC games.
8251000	8254000	For Game of Thrones I know they did a Game of Thrones one didn't they?
8254000	8256000	Very interesting.
8256000	8258000	But yeah.
8259000	8263000	So one game I forgot to mention that I played during my game week this week was Grand Theft Auto 5.
8263000	8267000	And of course part of that I didn't play was Grand Theft Auto Online.
8267000	8270000	I still have been kind of wary to go back into it because so much has changed.
8270000	8275000	I don't think I'll be able to figure out what to do because there's just so much out there.
8275000	8279000	But one of the things that, one of the comments around that.
8279000	8286000	I guess they had a, I want to say their financial meeting or something like that.
8286000	8289000	But Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick.
8289000	8297000	He had spoken to I guess GameStop regarding his stance on microtransactions and how they relate to Grand Theft Auto Online.
8297000	8305000	And basically saying you know, you can't give stuff away for free in perpetual, or perpetuality.
8305000	8310000	There's no business model in that which you know basically that makes sense.
8310000	8318000	We're convinced that we are probably from an industry view under monetizing on a per user basis.
8318000	8323000	But we're not trying to optimize the monetization of everything.
8323000	8330000	We do to the nth degree. My concern is if you do that, the consumer knows.
8330000	8334000	They might not even know that, or they may not even know that they know.
8334000	8336000	But they feel it.
8336000	8339000	There is wood to chop because I think we can do more.
8339000	8343000	I think we can do more without interfering with our business strategy.
8343000	8348000	And being the most creative about our ethical approach which is delighting consumers.
8348000	8351000	We're not going to grab the last nickel.
8351000	8355000	It's respectable. They do give out a lot of content for free.
8355000	8358000	However, there's a lot of stuff that is revolving.
8358000	8363000	I mean this is back from when I played Grand Theft Auto Online quite a bit several years ago.
8364000	8368000	There is a lot that goes around money in the game.
8368000	8371000	Like they used to have it where you have to buy insurance for your vehicles.
8371000	8375000	And they get destroyed by another player. You have to pay money to fix your car.
8375000	8382000	You know, unnecessary realities I guess in the game.
8382000	8385000	I mean that's not necessarily a fun thing.
8385000	8391000	But it's just something that's another thing to spend money on in the game.
8391000	8394000	It's been a while since I played it.
8394000	8397000	You just started playing Overwatch, right? This is something they love to do in that.
8397000	8400000	Well, Overwatch is mostly just skin crap.
8400000	8401000	That's true.
8401000	8407000	And there's a lot of customization stuff you can buy in Grand Theft Auto with the in-game money.
8407000	8410000	But that's all stuff you can earn by doing missions.
8410000	8412000	It's as if you don't want to wait to do all that stuff.
8412000	8415000	You can get their shark cards and bypass all that.
8415000	8418000	But they certainly give you a lot of stuff.
8418000	8424000	I feel that for what they put out there for free, the content, there's a lot of it.
8424000	8430000	So I'm not saying that they're pulling the whole free-to-play stunt on it.
8430000	8433000	But I think you get a lot of value for Grand Theft Auto Online.
8433000	8436000	Plus you have Grand Theft Auto 5, which is a fantastic game altogether.
8436000	8438000	And you got that for free basically.
8438000	8443000	I mean I understand where he's saying that there's probably more stuff they can monetize for.
8443000	8446000	But as long as they don't do it in a way that feels cheap.
8446000	8448000	And like I said, it's been a while since they played it.
8448000	8452000	So hopefully it seems that a lot of the stuff that's coming out now is more of that,
8452000	8454000	ooh, I really want to have that because that's cool.
8454000	8461000	And not, ugh, I got to pay money for a mechanic to stay around every single day and rent for my apartment and all that stuff.
8461000	8462000	And that's kind of lame.
8462000	8465000	But I don't know, we'll see what that's like.
8465000	8468000	But it sounds like, I mean so far it's been alright.
8470000	8472000	Alright, well one more story for you guys.
8472000	8474000	And we're going to open up the Skypline at Orange Lounge Radio.
8474000	8479000	And this is about a, this is a series that's near and dear to our hearts here at Orange Lounge Radio.
8479000	8481000	It's the River City Ransom series.
8481000	8486000	And yep, River City's getting a new game actually coming out in the 3DS eShop.
8486000	8488000	River City Knights of Justice.
8488000	8493000	Now here's the thing, this game actually came out in Japan way back April 2014.
8493000	8495000	This game originally came out.
8495000	8499000	It is finally coming to North America and Europe this summer.
8499000	8501000	Well over three years after the fact.
8501000	8502000	Wow.
8502000	8508000	In Japan this game was called Nekketsu Maho Monogatari on the 3DS eShop.
8508000	8509000	And now we're going to get it.
8509000	8513000	Yay, it's a 3DS eShop exclusive, meaning there's no retail copy available.
8513000	8516000	This is where Kunio and his friends go medieval.
8516000	8518000	So you get heroes and villains.
8518000	8520000	Yeah, it looks just like Dragon Quest.
8520000	8525000	Yeah, it's kind of like that whole world meets a fantasy game.
8525000	8529000	I'm kind of down with like a River City Ransom game set in like a Dragon Quest universe.
8529000	8530000	That'd be pretty cool.
8530000	8534000	Magic to bring peace back to Riverandia.
8534000	8537000	Definitely a plot rather than those games, right?
8537000	8540000	I hope there's something that cures barf.
8540000	8545000	Remember in the NES game you punch the enemies, they go barf.
8545000	8547000	That was always the funniest thing when I was younger.
8547000	8549000	I don't know, it probably still is funny.
8549000	8552000	Have you ever made your kids play River City Ransom?
8552000	8554000	No, they have never played that.
8554000	8557000	You should have them check it out and see if they laugh when barf comes up on the screen.
8557000	8559000	I don't think they know what the word barf means.
8559000	8560000	You should teach them.
8560000	8561000	They actually know.
8561000	8562000	I spent some time with Uncle Rob.
8562000	8563000	Uncle Rob will teach them.
8563000	8564000	They know what throw up means.
8564000	8566000	I'm sure it's pretty easy for them.
8566000	8567000	Alright.
8567000	8569000	Again, River City Knights of Justice.
8569000	8571000	It's going to be at E3 actually.
8571000	8573000	The Natsume booth will have this.
8573000	8574000	So you can check that out.
8574000	8579000	Or you can watch the various YouTubes of the Japanese version that's already out there if you want to check that out.
8579000	8582000	Alright, I hope this series finds its way.
8582000	8585000	What do they call all these characters?
8585000	8586000	Kunio, is that what it's called?
8586000	8587000	The whole series?
8587000	8588000	The Kunio-kun.
8588000	8589000	Kunio-kun, that's it.
8589000	8593000	I hope this series makes its way to Switch one way or another.
8593000	8602000	Like, you know, I know they did like an All-Stars game on 3DS that like kind of brought the dodgeball and the River City Ransom worlds together.
8602000	8607000	But man, that dodgeball game, that was one of my favorite arcade games they ever did back in the day was that Kunio.
8607000	8609000	It was on the Neo Geo, right?
8609000	8610000	The dodgeball game?
8610000	8611000	Wasn't that a Neo Geo?
8611000	8615000	Originally, I know they did a version on the NES, but I feel like there was a version in the arcade I played.
8615000	8617000	So, Dark Tetsuya agrees with me there.
8617000	8619000	Yeah, totally need a Switch version of Kunio.
8619000	8620000	Agree.
8620000	8622000	Skype line is open!
8622000	8624000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8624000	8631000	If you want to give us a call to talk about anything we might have touched on tonight or perhaps we missed it and you want to let us know.
8631000	8632000	You can do that.
8632000	8634000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8634000	8639000	While we wait to see if anybody takes advantage of that tonight, Loki, let me check in with you.
8639000	8640000	Do you have any last minute stories for us?
8641000	8649000	Yes, there's been leaks already of stuff that Sony's going to be announcing, including a brand new PlayStation 4 system that's going to be gold colored.
8649000	8652000	Coming out June 9th, they already have pictures of it.
8652000	8653000	Big deal.
8653000	8654000	Yeah.
8654000	8655000	A gold PS4.
8655000	8656000	What's special about it?
8656000	8657000	Is it just...
8657000	8658000	It's gold.
8658000	8659000	Here's my question.
8659000	8660000	Is it a pro?
8660000	8662000	No, it's not.
8662000	8663000	See?
8663000	8664000	Hmm.
8664000	8665000	I feel like...
8665000	8666000	God damn it, Sony!
8666000	8669000	$249 for one terabyte model.
8670000	8672000	Okay, again, it's rumor, so...
8672000	8674000	It's not rumor, I see a picture of it right here.
8674000	8675000	Oh, so like...
8675000	8679000	It's Target or Walmart or something got it and they took a picture of it.
8679000	8681000	Looks like Walmart based off the price.
8681000	8682000	So...
8682000	8684000	It's not on the internet, so it must be true.
8684000	8686000	Well, no, I mean, it's a box in a Walmart.
8686000	8688000	It's in their case, locked up.
8688000	8692000	So they're planning on doing one of those, it's available today type of things.
8692000	8693000	Yeah.
8693000	8694000	Okay.
8694000	8695000	Which, you know, whatever.
8695000	8700000	Technically it would be coming out on, before E3, it would be coming out on the 9th, so...
8700000	8701000	You know.
8701000	8702000	Interesting.
8702000	8703000	But I just...
8703000	8706000	Isn't it weird that it's not a pro?
8706000	8710000	So, Sony's kind of already taken a step back from that?
8710000	8711000	Yeah.
8711000	8715000	That should have been on my list of things I want to see from Sony at E3 is like, give
8715000	8716000	me more of this pro thing.
8716000	8720000	Because this is, this is really starting to become a pet peeve when it comes to Sony.
8720000	8724000	I am really having trust issues with Sony peripherals.
8724000	8727000	And this is a big reason why I haven't plunked the money down on VR, because I feel really
8727000	8730000	burned by PlayStation 4 Pro.
8730000	8733000	And, you know, this has happened with the Vita.
8733000	8735000	This has happened with the Move.
8735000	8737000	This has happened with...
8737000	8740000	I want to say the PSP, but I suppose that's...
8740000	8743000	They tried with the PSP a lot longer than other devices to be fair.
8743000	8745000	So I can't really pick on them for that.
8745000	8747000	But it seems like as of recent, like Sony really...
8747000	8750000	Oh, the TV, the PlayStation TV thing.
8750000	8752000	They ran the hell away from that too.
8752000	8753000	3D.
8753000	8758000	So I'm getting really concerned with how fast Sony is backtracking on these peripherals.
8758000	8761000	And they do need to be, you know, if we're going to be critical of Nintendo and all this
8761000	8765000	stuff too, we need to be critical of Sony when they are making missteps too.
8765000	8767000	And this is one of them for me.
8767000	8769000	This whole backtracking of peripherals.
8769000	8771000	I mean, this is just one picture.
8771000	8774000	I mean, they could have a pro model that's available as well.
8774000	8775000	We don't know.
8775000	8776000	That's fair enough.
8776000	8780000	Right now, I'm assuming they probably don't, or it could be a different color or who knows?
8780000	8781000	That's fair.
8781000	8782000	They could have it available.
8782000	8785000	But at the very least, we're going to get a different color PlayStation 4 system, which
8785000	8786000	honestly, it doesn't look that great.
8786000	8787000	It's gold.
8787000	8788000	I mean, it kind of looks cheap.
8788000	8791000	Yeah, it's one of those things where like that would be cool if I didn't already own
8791000	8792000	one.
8792000	8795000	But well, maybe with the announcement that they're ending PlayStation 3 production, this
8795000	8797000	is the time to entice people to jump into that.
8797000	8798000	I don't know.
8798000	8804000	SH2100Matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, feels like Sony has worst kept secret
8804000	8808000	leak before each E3, but they do somehow keep something to surprise.
8808000	8809000	It's a very minor thing.
8809000	8810000	Yeah.
8810000	8815000	Well, if that's already on shelves June 9th, then it isn't really an E3 or anything.
8815000	8821000	It's more one of those, they want to get it on shelves because of the hype E3 might build.
8821000	8824000	Like there might be something they're going to show that make people go, oh, we need to
8824000	8826000	go out and get a PlayStation 4 because this is going to be on it.
8826000	8828000	And so they want it to be on the shelves.
8828000	8829000	That part I kind of get.
8829000	8831000	Anyway, we are getting a call on the phone, so I want to get to it.
8831000	8832000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8832000	8833000	Who's this?
8833000	8834000	Hey, this is Akdeft.
8834000	8835000	Hey, Akdeft.
8835000	8836000	How you doing?
8836000	8837000	Pretty great.
8837000	8838000	Good.
8838000	8839000	What's on your mind, my friend?
8840000	8846000	Well, I want to talk about Nintendo and it's voice chat options for the Switch.
8846000	8847000	Please.
8847000	8848000	What's your take?
8848000	8849000	We talked ad nauseam about it.
8849000	8851000	What's your take on it?
8851000	8856000	Well, like I said in chat, I do see Loki's point.
8856000	8864000	It seems overly complicated to Nintendo to do this, but at the same time I see some practicality
8864000	8873000	from it because since the Switch is a portable console and you're not necessarily going to
8873000	8882000	be playing on the TV, having your smartphone pretty much everywhere you go is like something
8882000	8888000	that, okay, you can use this instead of hooking everything up to the console.
8889000	8896000	I see it more like a practical thing, but yeah, Nintendo does seem to overcomplicate things.
8896000	8901000	No, thank you so much, Akdeft, because you reminded me of something big and I really
8901000	8905000	wish I'd thought of this when Loki and I were debating this earlier, but thank you, thank you, thank you.
8905000	8907000	You reminded me of why.
8907000	8908000	You're right.
8908000	8913000	It's the Switch's portability issue and they didn't want to charge more money by putting
8913000	8920000	a 3G thing in the Switch like the Vita used, lololol, not very well, that whole thing.
8920000	8925000	That's what they're doing to get around data so you can do voice chat when you're on the go
8925000	8930000	is that by doing it on your phone then the Switch doesn't have to have that component built into it
8930000	8932000	making the system cost more money.
8932000	8934000	Thank you, Deft, I wish I'd thought of that earlier.
8934000	8940000	And to counter that, okay, if it has to be tethered to the phone anyways because it needs to have
8940000	8947000	data in order to play multiplayer, why still can't the voice chat go through the system and not a separate app?
8947000	8952000	But technically we still don't know exactly how it's going to work.
8952000	8956000	It may be an option, so maybe.
8956000	8961000	Well, we'll see. Again, I still feel like debating this is a little early.
8961000	8963000	I mean, it doesn't stop the internet from doing it anyway.
8963000	8969000	I know some of y'all Nintendo fans get needled by what Loki says, but he ain't saying nothing that
8969000	8970000	other people ain't already saying.
8970000	8974000	Well, here's the thing, I find it was a separate app to do if you want to schedule stuff.
8974000	8978000	Say you don't have your Switch with you, you're at work doing something and some friend's like,
8978000	8982000	hey, I want to play a game later and you go, okay, I'm going to schedule something and then you go home
8982000	8984000	and then you can do that and the app works with it.
8984000	8985000	And it's all set up magically, yeah.
8985000	8991000	And that would be fine, but to require you to use your phone for it seems stupid.
8991000	8995000	That's the thing. I don't know, whatever.
8995000	8996000	They're going to do whatever they're going to do.
8996000	9001000	Maybe it's to force people into the app so that becomes commonplace.
9001000	9006000	Because what good is it to go in and schedule something if the other people are like,
9006000	9008000	oh, I don't use that app because I'm not required to.
9008000	9009000	Well, don't build an app then.
9009000	9011000	I don't know. We'll see.
9011000	9020000	The thing too, sorry, the thing, it's also that many people use other voice chat apps for voice chat.
9020000	9024000	We see Discord, we see Skype, even Google Hangouts.
9024000	9030000	So I, again, do not see the big issue here or the big problem.
9030000	9036000	Again, Nintendo's overly complicating things, but at the same time, I see the practicality in it.
9036000	9039000	So that's my take on it.
9039000	9044000	Well, this is something we're certainly going to revisit in about, in two weeks' time basically,
9044000	9051000	on the 15-year anniversary episode, when we know what Nintendo's going to say about this whole thing.
9051000	9058000	I mean, there is the very realistic possibility they may not address the whole voice chat thing in their presentation.
9058000	9061000	However, with the hours and hours of Treehouse that they're doing,
9061000	9067000	I do expect this topic to come up at some point, especially with Splatoon 2 coming out in July.
9067000	9069000	And they do want to sell that game.
9069000	9073000	I feel like Nintendo is going to have to start to peel back.
9073000	9077000	What is this going to look like? Because it's very important for Splatoon 2.
9077000	9082000	Yes, we know you're going to be able to play online, and it's obviously going to be free now until 2018,
9082000	9084000	because of the delay of Nintendo Online.
9084000	9089000	But what does Splatoon 2 look like six months from now when you're scheduling events and all this stuff?
9089000	9092000	I do think Nintendo kind of has to answer that question.
9092000	9097000	If it's not in the main presentation, at least maybe a demo during the Treehouse.
9097000	9101000	Because they're going to have so many hours to fill during Treehouse,
9101000	9105000	and you know they're going to push arms and they're going to push Splatoon 2 during Treehouse.
9105000	9110000	They have to. Those are the big games over the summer that they want people to go out and buy.
9110000	9115000	Yeah, especially Splatoon 2. That's going to be a really, really big game.
9115000	9120000	And it's so funny, because we were talking about this whole arms and esports and all this stuff.
9120000	9125000	And honestly, if anything Nintendo should be esports, it ought to be Splatoon.
9125000	9131000	Well, they've already asserted that it's going to be with their stupid trailer that showed this big esports arena.
9131000	9137000	They're already playing on their Switch and hunky-dory. I mean, they've already solidified it's going to be esports.
9137000	9140000	I think it could be with Splatoon.
9140000	9147000	Well, they're going to have their tournament thing, invitational for Splatoon 2.
9147000	9150000	And they're going to have actual Splatoon teams.
9150000	9156000	But to be fair, as critical as Loki's being, and I am being, to a point of this whole thing,
9156000	9159000	this isn't that different from what Blizzard does.
9159000	9162000	Blizzard also puts together their own events for their own games.
9162000	9166000	And they're taking it even bigger with this whole Overwatch League thing.
9166000	9170000	So, you can't say this is something unique to Nintendo.
9170000	9175000	Although I do agree there has to be some sort of adoption by the community.
9175000	9179000	But at the same time, also, look what's happening to Street Fighter V.
9179000	9184000	You know, Street Fighter V seemed to be this very logical, like, this is going to be the next big thing.
9184000	9186000	And I think it is being adopted to a point.
9186000	9192000	But Street Fighter V is kind of, in some ways, Street Fighter V is kind of, I don't want to say flopped,
9192000	9196000	but it's not hit that level that you would expect of a Street Fighter franchise game.
9196000	9199000	Yeah, definitely not the same as Street Fighter IV.
9199000	9207000	Exactly. Now, games can, we live in this very strange day and age now where games can be resurrected.
9207000	9209000	Like Diablo III, Final Fantasy XIV.
9209000	9212000	Well, look at Street Fighter V. I mean, look at why it didn't take off.
9212000	9214000	It's because it was released unfinished.
9214000	9216000	Yeah. No, I don't disagree.
9216000	9221000	Let all the publishers realize, hey, if you release your game unfinished, probably not going to be taken too well.
9221000	9222000	I don't disagree with that.
9222000	9224000	Especially when you're asking for a finished price.
9224000	9226000	Yeah, I don't disagree with that.
9226000	9230000	I kind of disagree on that, but eh, yeah, it was unfinished.
9230000	9234000	But the game, when it came out, it worked flawlessly.
9234000	9238000	At least the gameplay itself, it was perfect.
9238000	9240000	But yeah, I don't understand the point.
9240000	9243000	Alright. Well, Akdeaf, do you have anything else you want to share?
9243000	9248000	No, I will call you in two weeks, I think.
9248000	9250000	Alright, sounds good. Can't wait for it.
9250000	9251000	Alright, take care, my friend.
9251000	9253000	Okay, thanks for having me.
9253000	9255000	Yeah, anytime. Bye-bye.
9255000	9259000	Alright, we'll see if anybody else wants to sneak in there real quick, otherwise we'll wrap things up.
9259000	9261000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
9261000	9266000	Post-show tonight, I'm going to stream Mario Kart 8, because I've been promising that for like two weeks.
9266000	9268000	And finally, I'm going to do it tonight.
9268000	9270000	So hopefully some of y'all will be online to race with me.
9270000	9274000	I'm not going to set up a formal tournament, because last time I did that, we ran into issues.
9274000	9277000	So this time, I'm just going to see what happens if I do multiplayer.
9277000	9282000	And hopefully there aren't more people that want to play, but we'll see what happens.
9282000	9285000	It's going to be a learning experience, one way or the other.
9285000	9290000	I have a bad feeling we might run into the opposite problem than we do with tournaments, but we'll see.
9290000	9293000	We're going to have fun, no matter what. We're going to play Mario Kart, we're going to have fun.
9293000	9299000	Yeah, and they also show the, it's in a Target ad too, so it's definitely coming.
9299000	9305000	They're saying it's $50 off for $249.99. They're also selling the controllers separately.
9305000	9307000	Of course they are.
9307000	9310000	Because the controllers must be separate from the machine you have to use them on.
9310000	9314000	Well, no. I mean, if you want additional gold controllers, you can buy them separately.
9314000	9322000	So, what's funny is that now that I do have two PlayStation 4 controllers, because a friend gave us one for Christmas, so we have a red controller too,
9322000	9328000	I find it's really funny, like, I keep one plugged into the PlayStation charging, and then I use the other one,
9328000	9332000	and then the minute the battery thing starts flashing, I just switch them.
9332000	9336000	I plug the black one in, I take the red one back. It's kind of a nice system.
9337000	9344000	I still can't, and I mentioned this last week, I still can't believe that the Xbox One controllers still take AA batteries.
9344000	9350000	And you have to buy a separate battery pack for that. That is stupid. Especially for the price that they're charging for those controllers.
9350000	9355000	Yeah, maybe that's something that will change a little bit with Scorpio. We'll see. I mean, you would hope with the price you're going to pay for that.
9355000	9362000	Yeah, and actually Bobby Blackwell says, I love that they take AA batteries. I love that. I wish more controllers gave that option.
9362000	9367000	I do think a keyword there is option. It would be great if a controller could take both.
9367000	9370000	Well it can, you just have to buy that battery pack separate though.
9370000	9378000	Of course, of course. Anyhow, since no other calls are coming in, I think we're going to take the hint and go ahead and wrap up.
9378000	9386000	I do want to remind everybody, E3 officially starts in six days with EA, and it's going to be a fun week of leaks and so forth.
9386000	9392000	There's also, you know, to be fair, Apple's got a big tech thing going, what WWDC is this week.
9392000	9398000	And that could affect mobile gaming as we hear about inevitably iOS 11 and so forth.
9398000	9404000	So it's going to be a crazy week. At least this year it doesn't overlap with E3.
9404000	9410000	Because that's what usually happens is the Apple thing. That happened one year where Apple's conference was at the exact same time as Nintendo or something.
9410000	9416000	I don't remember what it was, but it was a mess. So thankfully this year there's a little breathing room between them.
9416000	9418000	But it's going to be a crazy week into the summer.
9418000	9426000	But thank you guys for spending your Sundays here with Orange Launch Radio, participating in the spirited debate, but never mean debate.
9426000	9430000	Because at the end of the day, we all still respect each other's opinions and all that good stuff.
9430000	9433000	And we really appreciate you guys that show up here at Orange Launch Radio live every week.
9434000	9441000	And if you do enjoy what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two to check out the show over at the VOG Network, vognetwork.com.
9441000	9446000	And joining us here live on Sunday nights. Word of mouth goes a real long way.
9446000	9454000	Again, if you can't think of a lot of friends to tell, nice reviews on iTunes or Google Play or wherever it is that you found this show.
9454000	9455000	Five star reviews go a long way.
9455000	9457000	Remember, if you can't use your mouth, use your fingers.
9458000	9461000	I like that. I do like that. If you can't use your mouth, use your fingers.
9461000	9465000	Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night.
9465000	9467000	Loki, your final thought?
9467000	9474000	My final thought is... I don't know. Maybe get some programming.
9474000	9476000	You can do it.
9476000	9479000	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
9479000	9486000	Jan, I miss ice cream. I miss carbs. I really want more cheese.
9486000	9495000	Same issue too. And my final thought tonight is, I can't believe my birthday is this month and I'm turning older.
9495000	9496000	Rob?
9496000	9501000	No, I'm not doom and gloom about it, but it's just one of those like, oh gosh.
9501000	9504000	I like how I didn't need to say anything. I just needed to say Rob.
9504000	9510000	Well, it's not what you said, it's how you said it. Because you said it like, girl.
9510000	9511000	Let me learn you a thing.
9511000	9517000	Exactly. Oh, and I think this is also a very, very, very important thing to put out there and I want to make sure I do say this.
9517000	9526000	My mom was discharged from the hospital earlier this week after she was in the ICU for six days with her condition.
9526000	9532000	And she is, thanks to the miracle of drugs, she's doing a lot better.
9532000	9535000	And there are going to be some changes with her lifestyle.
9535000	9546000	She is 76 years old after all, but I just really want to take a minute to thank everybody for all the kind things that were said on Twitter and social media and in chat and so on and so on.
9546000	9558000	And she has seen some of that too. I showed her Facebook and all that and she was really, really overwhelmed with all that and really appreciates all that as she is continuing on her path to recovery.
9558000	9565000	So I just want to give a real heartfelt thank you on her behalf and all of you that have been thinking of us. It's really, really, really appreciated.
9565000	9574000	So with that, I think that's a good positive note to end on. So I think we'll end it there and we're going to end the show for this week.
9574000	9579000	So we'll see you guys next time on Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys so much for being here. We'll see you in seven days.
9579000	9585000	And for those of you that are going to E3, travel safe and have fun.
